1j9n8hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestructiveReaders/comments/1j9n8hh/1399_the_secret_lives_of_teachers_a_horror_story/,"[1399] ""The Secret Lives of Teachers: A Horror Story"" First Chapter","

First chapter of satirical horror story. Supposed to be funny and also dark. Like teaching in America today! (I am a high-school teacher)



**Chapter 1**

  


The last day of summer vacation is one of the most poignantly glorious 24 hours of the year. It’s a day of final sleep-ins and sunburns, one long, glowingly warm afternoon that stretches lazily across the day like a cat in a pool of sunlight. 



For students, that is.



For teachers it’s Faculty Orientation Day. Or, as Sloane liked to re-acronym it, Fucking Obnoxious Drivel Day. 



But there was no indication on that bright, swelteringly hot Texas morning that this would be the most magical, harrowing, and traumatic school year of her life.



Unless, of course, you counted the tooth.



*That* was either a perfectly ordinary occurrence or a dire prophecy of impending horror.



“Why are you awake?” her husband Liam asked as she stumbled into the kitchen, hands flailing for the coffee machine. “It’s Faculty Orientation Day. You *never* go to Faculty Orientation Day.”



“Hasherbum,” Sloane mumbled, pouring coffee into a giant mug emblazoned with the script I BECAME A TEACHER FOR THE MONEY AND THE FAME. “Mushum. Meh.”



“*Daddy,*” their six-year-old son Oliver reprimanded his father through a mouthful of toast. “You cannot ask her any questions until she has her coffee. You have to wait ‘til she swallows and then count to ten.”



Sloane gave him the thumbs up. She took a deep glug of coffee and closed her eyes.



“Did you run out of excuses to get out of it?” Liam asked. “Or did they call your bluff from last year, when you claimed you had bubonic plague?” 



Sloane exhaled, slowly. “I did not say I had *bubonic plague,”* she said. “I told them I had had large, egg-like, hardened swellings in my armpit, neck, and groin, and that the tips of my fingers seemed to be turning black. I left the diagnosis up to their interpretation.”



“Being married to a historian is so weird,” Liam muttered.



“Anyway,” Sloane said, her words gathering speed as the caffeine took effect. “I want to be there today because they’re announcing something *huge*. That was their word: *HUGE.* The teachers think maybe it’s affordable housing for them on campus, or a pay raise, or a schedule change that actually allows us time to use the toilet between classes.”



“Hee hee hee,” their 4-year-old Flora giggled. “Mommy said *toilet*.”



“Mommy goes *poop* at school,” Oliver chortled. 



“With her *butt*!!” Flora yelled.



“Your humor is impeccable,” Sloane said, sliding into a chair next to them. “Obviously you both have high IQs and will go far in life.”



“*Butt*,” Oliver whispered, smothering his giggles. He took a big bite of toast. 



For a few moments there was only quiet chewing and sipping.



Then Oliver started screaming.



“Jesus Christ!” Sloane yelped, her coffee sloshing all over the table. Liam had leapt out of his chair and grabbed his son’s shoulders. “What’s wrong?? Are you OK?”



Oliver spat a glob of blood onto his plate. Nestled in the center was a tiny, milk-white splinter.



A tooth.



“Oh my GOD!” he shrieked, both incredibly terrified and phenomenally excited “It just popped out of my *body*! There is *blood* in my mouth!”



“It’s all right buddy,” Liam said, grabbing a tissue and pressing it to Oliver’s mouth. “It’ll stop in a second. You just lost your first tooth! Yay!”



Sloane sat completely still, staring at the tooth lying on the plate. It was so tiny, barely larger than a fingernail, and had a sharp root that made it look strangely shark-like. It glistened in a small, pink puddle of bloody saliva. 



A strange thread of horror began creeping down her spine. It was like a tickle of terror, making her shiver. She felt it spool in her stomach and then suddenly widen – a bottomless chasm of the deepest dread. The feeling paralyzed her, centering her focus on that tiny, revolting tooth. 



A tiny sliver of a body. A crumb of a skeleton. Teeth, Sloane suddenly realized, are a reminder of the bones beneath us, the only part of a skeleton that shows. The whole rest of that horrible, clattering contraption is sheathed in muscle and fat and blood and skin, but the teeth stick out. Every grin is a macabre reminder of what we will eventually look like when every other piece of us has fallen away. And here was one lying right before her, sharp and raw and smelling faintly of buttered toast.



What a monstrous thing. 



“Sloane?” Liam asked, his voice sounding far away. “Are you OK?”



“Mommy!” Oliver cried, shoving his face between her and the tooth. “Look!!” He grinned at her, and she saw the dark spot in his mouth where the tooth had been. 



A void. A tiny black hole, right in the center of his mouth.



Sloane could feel the blood rushing in her ears. She felt unable to take a breath. She closed her eyes.



Then she felt strong hands on her shoulders, and Liam was shaking her, jokingly yelling “Someone get this lady more caffeine! Wake up, Mommy!”



Flora climbed onto the table and shoved Sloane’s coffee cup toward her. The hot liquid sloshed on her hand, and the sudden jolt of pain made her eyes fly open. The awful terror disappeared so completely it made her gasp for breath.



“Whew!” Sloane said, shaking her head vigorously. She lifted the mug and took several big slugs of coffee, feeling suddenly giddy with relief. What a weird moment that had been – a vestige from a dream or something. 



Everyone had existential crises sometimes. Probably everyone had mornings where the reality of their own mortality smashed them right between the eyes. So common no one ever talked about it.



Sloane reached for a paper towel to mop up the mess from two coffee spills. “This is excellent news, bud!” she told Oliver, who was looking at her with his brows furrowed. “The Tooth Fairy is gonna come tonight!”



“What?” Oliver asked, and at the same time Flora squealed “A *fairy*?”



“Yeah!” Liam said, enthusiastically. “When you lose a tooth you put it under your pillow and the Tooth Fairy comes at night to collect it, and leaves you money*.*” 



“Money fairies!” Flora yelled, clapping her hands enthusiastically.



“The Tooth Fairy comes to take my tooth?” Oliver repeated. “She pays me for my tooth?”



“Yup!” Liam said, and Sloane could see him calculating in his head: what was the current going rate for the Tooth Fairy? Inflation and all that . . . 



Oliver frowned. “What does she do with the teeth?”



There were a few beats of silence.



“Um,” Liam said. 



“Does she build things with them?” Oliver asked. “Like maybe she builds herself a house out of teeth?” Liam grimaced. 



“I want to live in a house of teeth,” said Flora, earnestly. “It would be so white. Also maybe pink, like a tongue! Are there tongues in the Tooth Fairy’s house?”



“Jesus, Flora,” Liam said, his face twisting.



“I *love* fairies,” Flora informed him. “Does the Tooth Fairy have beautiful wings?”



“Of course,” Liam said, grasping for safer ground. “She has beautiful wings that she uses to fly all over the world to collect teeth.”



“But how does she know when you lose one?” Oliver asked. “Can she *smell* them?”



Sloane put her hand over her mouth to stop herself laughing at Liam’s expression. She imagined a horrifying little creature with a dead-eyed, sharky face, sniffing the air for the smell of raw, bloody baby teeth. Who the hell had thought up this Tooth Fairy business in the first place? When you got right down to it, the bitch was *creepy.* 



“Time for camp!” Liam announced, overly cheerful. “Last day of camp before school starts. Are you excited?”



Both kids jumped up. “I can’t wait to show them my *hole*!” Oliver squealed, running to the door to get his shoes. Sloane stood, grabbing the kids’ plates to dump in the sink.



“Have a good day, sweetheart,” Liam said, grabbing his car keys from the counter and kissing her goodbye. “Don’t be too pissed off when they inevitably disappoint you. Do you want a bottle or wine or a box of donuts as consolation when you come home?”



“*Hey,*” Sloane protested. “Have a little faith, man.” She drained her coffee. “Donuts, please.”



Within minutes, the family was out the door and the house was silent.



The tooth lay on the plate. The last remaining bubbles of saliva popped. 



Everything waited.

1j9mxjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoreyWayne/comments/1j9mxjk/am_i_pursuing_too_much/,Am I pursuing too much?,"Hey guys! Apologies for the long post, but I wanted to include enough details because people often complain that posters don't give them enough to go off on.

So, there's a girl from my salsa class (I've made a couple of other posts previously, there's more details there) and she's showing high attraction 7-8, she does what I ask her to, and is really submissive to me and affectionate. We saw each other for a month in Dec to mid-Jan where she'd end up staying at my place for 2-3 nights in a row, then she went back to the US for 2 months, but kept in touch.

Bear in mind, my goal here is a long-term relationship (though we have not explicitly said we're exclusive) and she's also mentioned previously that she's ""all or nothing"" when it come to relationships and wants to find a life partner with who she can raise kids, etc. She hasn't shown any dodgy or suspicious behaviour so far. I'm not in a rush anywhere, but here's what's on my mind.

Here's what's happened over the last week and a bit:

* She was on this trip to the US, came back last Tuesday. Mid-Feb, I had told her to text me when she was on her way back and Monday morning, she texted me saying ""Hey! I'm on my way back to Bulgaria. Are you free Tuesday/Wednesday evening?"" which I read as a sign of high attraction - after a 20hr journey, the first thing she wanted to do is see me! I was busy that night so I set a date for Wednesday. I saw her Wednesday, we hit a bar, laughed, kept it playful, then went back to mine so I could show her the new salsa moves we were taught at class, had sex, watched some series, had sex again, she slept over (she even asked me if I had a toothbrush I could give her, plus she's made her own designated  ""pajama"" from one of my shirts).
* The next evening, I went to my salsa class which she also attends. As it finished, she said she'd wait for me so we walk back together (we go in the same direction after, me to my MMA classes, she goes back home). During the walk, I asked her about her weekend, she said she was free and asked me back so I set a date for Sunday evening (I was busy Sat).
* On Sunday, I was recovering from a cold so I texted her ""Hey, just a heads up, I'm recovering from a cold, I'm almost back at 100%, but could still be contagious. I'm still up for tonight, but if you'd rather reschedule, I'd totally get it. Let me know what you think"" to which she replied she ""Lol, I was just about to text you the same thing! I'd really like to see you tonight :)"" *\[quick question - was this a weak move? It felt like being honest about it and risking her wanting to reschedule was the masculine way to go about it although I wonder if it would have been better to reschedule altogether even though I was basically feeling fine\]*. We had a great evening again, more laughs and giggles, went back to mine, had sex, watched series, had sex, slept over, had coffee in the morning.
* On Monday, I went to salsa again (classes are Mon + Thu). I didn't go to my usual MMA training after so as we walked back again, I asked her what she's doing and she said she had no plans so I teasingly asked her ""Do you want me to give you some ideas?"" with a smirk and she chuckled and said ""Go ahead"" so we went back to mine, more sex, more series, loads and loads of laughing, more sex (which she started initiating), slept over again, then went to this cafe Tuesday morning, then went out own ways.
* Tomorrow, I'm planning to see if she's available for the weekend again and set another date for Saturday/Sunday.

Now, so far, so good although I'm sure you can see why I've titled my post this way. I can tell she is into me and she is beginning to feel very comfortable around me. However, I have a couple of worries and I hope you guys could steer me the right way:

1. Am I pursuing too much/being too available? I get a bit confused with the initiation dynamics here because we're at the salsa class together anyway (we go there independently), then we walk back together. I'd chalk it up to me pursuing her in this case, but she is literally there and wide open to it, it would be silly to miss out on the chance (am I deluding myself here or nah?), plus she's always available when I ask so that tells me she is opening her schedule up for me which is positive. Still, it feels like I'm doing a bit too much. **Given that we've already spent Sunday and Monday night together, should I avoid asking her if she's got plans for the weekend and instead wait for her to drop a hint/text me after? \[One date per week\]**
2. I do feel like I'm starting to fall for her and overthink setting plans with her (as you can see from this post). I want to give her to opportunity to chase and wonder, but then again we see each other Mon and Thu for salsa classes and that kind of removes that whole mystery of ""What's he doing? Does he miss me?"", etc. I plan on using the Thursdays to set dates for the weekend and just let her reach out the rest of the time. Previously, she has shown she'd reach out via text, but the salsa classes were paused for the holidays then and there was the uncertainty of when we'll see each other next.

I feel like I don't really need to do much here apart from staying patient and doing what I've done (or maybe a bit less), but what do you think? Again, sorry for the long post.",1,1741794043.0,CoreyWayne,1,1.0,False

1j9mvhp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j9mvhp,"Today’s boule, 2 months into sourdough baking","Hey r/sourdough folks!

I have spent the last two months of admiring some kick-ass, mouth-watering bread photos here. I’ve also been learning drom discussions on the ones that didn’t hit, so shout out everyone brave enough to post a fail.

But after some positive prodding from my brother to post my own bread here, here I am with today’s boule.

I’d been interested in sourdough for a while but I never quite got around to getting a starter… err, started. I’ve had a fun little bread machine for some time, but I was curious about taking the baking game to the next level.

I bought “How to raise a loaf and fall in love with sourdough.” by Rory Allen last summer from a cool local bookstore, but I pretty much used it as a mini coffee table book and didnt actually start on sourdough after buying that.

Flash forward to two months ago and my wonderful girlfriend bought me “Eve,” the dehydrated starter from Southern Sourdough Co, and that sweet lil’ gift not only finally got me going, it also seems to have unleashed the baking maniac inside me.

I’ve been working on the starter since then and have been baking every week too.

I started out using the simple recipe/technique from Alexandra’s Kitchen (https://alexandracooks.com/2017/10/24/artisan-sourdough-made-simple-sourdough-bread-demystified-a-beginners-guide-to-sourdough-baking/). I’ve since made a few small tweaks to this, and for today’s, I went with:

Autolyze 375g room temperature filtered water + 100g starter (which I’d fed 1-1-1 until doubled in size), let sit for 1 hour

Add 450g bread flour + 50g whole wheat flour, combine using bread whisk until shaggy dough. Cover bowl with towel and let rest for 1 hour

Add 11g kosher salt mixed with 15g room temperature filtered water

3 sets of stretch and folds with 30 mins rest between folds

Transfer to other container, cover with towel, then bulk ferment until doubled

Once doubled, transfer dough to lightly floured surface, shape into ball, then do that thing with the bench scraper to give a little tension and stuff. Rest for 30 mins, do it again, then transfer into covered banneton that’s got a little rice flour sprinkled around, and stick that in the fridge for 24 hours.

Preheat oven + Dutch oven to 450°F.

Transfer dough to parchment and score, then pop into Dutch oven for 30 mins covered baking. (I think my oven is tilted so I rotated the Dutch oven 180° in case that might help the dough rise evenly?)

Then remove cover for 15 mins baking at 425°/ when the internal temp reaches 210° F.

I waited 12 hours to slice that. I also think my 10” Dutch oven is maybe a little small + it’s got a round bottom so it makes the shape a little bunched up and wonky but eh, I don’t seem to mind.

This tastes really good to me with a moist, slightly sour crumb, but I’m open to considering any comments and suggestions. Thanks!

P.S.: once my starter got going, I named it Hideki ⚾️

I did notice I gained weight but I didn't realize how much till on my last year of uni I visited an old friend of mine that really helped me a ton during high-school when I had my ED.
After she mentioned I had to lose weight because it wasn't feminine and it wasn't good for my health, after this I started to feel insecure with my body again feeling fat everywhere I went and even sucking my belly in during pictures, videos or during coffee lines so people didn't see my shape, I even tried oversized clothes to hide it
I know it sounds strange but I didn't seem to care at all about by belly nor my weight gain prior to meeting my friend and now I don't know what to do, im self conscious about my health and that being overweight is harmful for you, but on the other hand it took me so much to accept who I was and love myself that I believe it will be difficult not to enter on my 'dark' ED phase again.

RICHES OF THE SOUL



READING: DAILY



Proverbs 30:1-9

The words of Aghur.

1; The words of Aghur son of Jakeh, the prophecy that the man spoke to Ithiel, to Ithiel, and to Ucal.

2; Surely I am more rude than all,

Neither do I have the understanding of man.

3; I have neither learned wisdom,

Nor do I know the knowledge of the Holy One.

4; Who has ascended to heaven, or descended?

Who has gathered the winds in his fists?

Who has bound the waters in a cloth?

Who has established all the ends of the earth?

What is his name, and the name of his son, if you know?

5; Every word of God is pure;

He is a shield to those who take refuge in him. 6;Do not add to his words, lest he rebuke you,

And you be found a liar.

7;Two things have I asked of you;

Do not withhold them from me before I die:

8;Remove vanity and lying words from me;

Give me neither poverty nor riches;

Supply me with food;

9;Lest I be filled, and deny you, and say, 'Who is the Lord?'

Or else I steal, being poor,

And blaspheme the name of my God.



Proverbs 30:8

;Remove vanity and lying words from me;

Give me neither poverty nor riches;

Supply me with food;



THE BIBLE IN ONE YEAR

Deuteronomy 17-19

Mark 13:1-20



Hoping to win a record-breaking $640,000,000 prize, Americans spent an estimated $1.5 million to buy lottery tickets for an interstate drawing in early 2012. The odds of winning were a staggering 1 in 176,000,000, yet people lined up at supermarkets, gas stations, and coffee shops to buy a chance at getting rich. Something inside us makes us think money will solve problems and improve our lives.



A Bible character named Agur had a different perspective on wealth when he asked God to grant him two requests before he died. First, he requested, ""Remove falsehood and lying words far from me"" (Proverbs 30:8). Integrity is key to living without anxiety. When we have nothing to hide, there is nothing to fear. Deceit enslaves, but honesty liberates. Second, he declared: “Give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with my daily bread” (v. 8). Contentment springs from trusting in God's provision and gratefully accepting what He provides. When speaking of the Creator, Agur noted that the Lord “has established all the ends of the earth \[...\]. He is a shield to those who take refuge in him” (vv. 4-5).

REUBEN (REFLECTION)

Integrity and contentment are riches of the soul available to all. Our Lord is pleased to grant these treasures to all who ask Him.

Dissatisfaction impoverishes, but contentment enriches!

AMEN.

[Original Post. ](https://rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/brajvq/my_27m_girlfriend_26f_stopped_talking_to_me_after/)**May 21, 2019**

We’ve been dating for about a year now, though we still live apart. Two weeks ago, I received a phone call asking if I was trying to use my credit card about 200 miles away. I immediately said no and to lock my credit card. They did and told me they would re-issue me a new card. Awesome customer service, seemed like they were saving my ass. Last week, I noticed an automatic payment I have tied to my card went through, I thought that was weird so I called my credit card company. They said there was no sign of fraud on my account. WTF.

I thought about it a bit more and my girlfriend has family in the city where they blocked the transaction. I checked my credit report and there it was, a credit card I’ve never seen before. My name is on it but the address is my girlfriend’s house. When I talked to her about it, she said she’s never seen it and knows nothing about it. Yesterday, I was able to call the credit card company and get a list of charges….almost all of them are places she frequents, same hair salon, same restaurant, same coffee shop, same supermarket, everything.

She came over last night and I called her out on it and showed her the list of charges, it adds up to more than $4000. She still denied everything. I told her it wouldn’t be hard to get surveillance footage of the person using the card, especially at the supermarkets, and she absolutely went off on me. She called me controlling, jealous and an awful person for blaming her. She left and texted me to call her when I’ve “decided to grow up”.

I do love this woman but, I’m just at a loss here.

>She’s a fkg criminal! Seriously, she opened up a credit card in your name!!! She has charged $4,000 in YOUR name!!!

>Report this awful criminal! What more do you want? She’s obviously going to lie and gaslight you.

>Run! And report this B!

**katlynsucks**

>Your girlfriend committed identity theft which is a felony. You have solid evidence it's her that did it and the fact that she still continues to lie about it, even after being called out, is a massive red flag. If she can do something like this only a year in, think about how bad it could get in the future or what other stuff she could lie about.

>I would call the bank and tell them you did *not* know anything about this card, and you still don't. And that they should cancel it immediately. Contact the police and explain your situation. Tell them your identity has been stolen and a card has been set up without your knowledge. Worst comes to worst involve a lawyer, as she has committed fraud you have a strong case.

>As for your girlfriend, she is not only lying to you but could possibly be committing 'financial infidelity', which is a dealbreaker

**needsmoarbokeh**

>Man, this is plain robbery. First, I'd call the bank and learn how the fuck they authorized to issue a card without your knowledge. If necessary they need to cover this with the fraud insurance. Second, this is a deal breaker. Someone like that can ruin your entire life. Call the bank, explain the problem let them solve the legal matters with your gf and cut everything with her. Like yesterday. Also, contact the police and press the charges.

[Update](https://rareddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/budz9d/update_my_27m_girlfriend_26f_stopped_talking_to/) **May 29, 2019**

I decided to “grow up” and break up with her. She didn’t have a lot of stuff at my house so I put it all into a few big boxes and had it shipped to her house. I also changed the access code to both my security system and my door locks.

The day I posted last week, I called her and told her I’m sending her all of her things (after I changed the code/lock code) and we were through. She said I was making a horrible mistake, then apologized, then said we can work through it…..I told her we couldn’t work through it and not to contact me anymore. Hung up and blocked her number.

I drove to the sheriff’s department in tears but I knew I could literally never trust her again. Once I got there, the deputy was super polite and said it happens more than you’d think. He took a report and had me complete a form swearing that everything I said was the truth.

The next day (Wednesday), I wake up to a pounding at the door. It’s my ex and she’s demanding to talk. Through the door, I told her to leave, she refused, pounding on the door and crying. It took everything I had not to open the door and at least speak with her. 5 minutes straight, she’s pounding on the door pleading with me. Then she starts getting quite a bit more violent, kicking the door and yelling obscenities. Since I was afraid she was going to start breaking glass, I called 911. After maybe 5 minutes of the obscenities, she just sat down in front of the door, which was where she was a couple of minutes later when the deputy go to my house (I live kind of outside of town in a rural subdivision).

The deputy asked her if she lived there and she said she doesn’t. The three of us talk for a few minutes and I gave him the report number from the day before. He didn’t know anything about it but he asked if I wanted to have my ex trespassed from my property. “Yes I do”, which set her off yelling and got her told off by the deputy. I signed a little slip of paper and he served her a copy of the trespass warning, if she comes back onto my property, she can be arrested for criminal trespassing.

She left at that point and I haven’t heard from her since. The sheriff’s office told me they will follow up with me as far as the identity theft charges go but that I may not hear anything for awhile. I’m working on getting the debt out of my name and so far, the credit card company is being very easy to work with, their fraud department said I should be clear of it within a month.

I truly appreciate the support I received from the thousands of people who commented here. Along with my family, I’ve realized I do deserve something far better than the relationship I had with a manipulative, controlling woman. For anyone else who might be going through this, just call the police, don’t think twice about it, let them do their job.

Shout out to r/stopIDtheft and r/personalfinance for going even more in-depth into everything. It made me feel a lot better about my decision. I’ll be happy to provide another update in the future if/when charges get filed or she gets prosecuted.

We were introduced by a mutual friend, he got my number, and texted me everyday after that. It was always super sweet stuff, he would tell me how pretty I was, and that he loved hanging out with me. I of course was flattered and constantly entertained the flirty text messages. When we would hang out, we always did fun things like sit on the beach and talk, mini golf, or go to the movies. He would randomly show up to my house with coffee for me, he once bought me nice jewelry for no reason, a purse, would fill my car with gas, just random thoughtful gestures. We started dating in September of 2023 and things were amazing. One of my close friends would always tell me how lucky I was that I found a guy who treated me so nicely. The mutual friend who introduced us would hear me gush about him, and once said to us, ""You guys are still in the honeymoon phase, it'll pass soon."" My boyfriend was so offended by that and told me, ""We will always be in the honeymoon phase, she is just a jealous, miserable person, and she has never and will never find someone that will treat her right."" Her comment enraged him, and I don't think he has ever liked our mutual friend the same since. Fast forward to December of 2023, I had just moved into my first apartment, and as soon as I finished unpacking, with the help of him, I sat down to relax and take a break from a stressful day of moving. It was seriously like a switch had flipped. He was all of a sudden so rude and grumpy towards me, and this was the first time he ever acted this way towards me. It was so unusual, that I even jotted it down in a locked note on my phone with the date. Since then, I have documented every fight or weird behavior I have noticed from him in that notes folder.

Fast Forward a few months from December, and he moves into the apartment with me. We do get along for the most part, he's very clean which is a plus, but his behavior towards me is just not what I would expect from a boyfriend. For example, he comes in the door after work, and never greets me, if I don't pipe up and say hello first he'll just ignore me, no smile on his face, no hug, no kiss. He doesn't randomly tell me how pretty I am anymore, or make me feel special. After finally mustering up the courage, I broke down crying to him, and expressed my frustrations about the lack of affection, attention, and the constant cold shoulder I was getting from him. he just went silent and didn't even say a word back, not that he would try to do better, just completely silent. Every fight, issue, disagreement, whatever it may be since that first fight, he still goes silent and doesn't acknoledge my words, which makes me even more upset. I don't understand why he acts this way towards me now, opposed to when we first met, and he would put me on a pedestal like I was a queen. His moods also change so quickly, one minute he can be joking around in good spirits, and the next he's pissed off at someone or something so minuscule and shuts down.

Yesterday would've been my dad's 50th birthday, he passed away three years ago. To celebrate his birthday my family went out to dinner and he came with me. I didn't even bother to tell him the dinner was for my dad's birthday because I wanted to see if he would say anything to me after, like condolences or just a comforting word. But, nothing, instead he criticized my grandma to me on the car ride home, saying it was so weird that she was crying at dinner. I couldn't even reply back because I already had tears in my eyes and had been fighting them off all day. Advice? ",1,1741793293.0,relationship_advice,9,0.67,False

The other day my co worker just asked in a polite way if he could tray up, it seemed to tick him off, he didn’t speak to us for the rest of the shift and started to throw things about and stormed past us.The environment was so uncomfortable and hostile.

Then today he approached me and asked where he was supposed to be on the shift (I’m not a BM) so I just said I’m not sure I thought he was running shift.Again this seemed to anger him.He didn’t speak to me or my other co worker but then said to another BM that we were being rude and ignorant, that he found the way I spoke to him offensive.I would never want to argue with anyone, so this other BM told me what he said and I just apologised for offending him.

He wasn’t satisfied with my apology and shouted at me on the bar, a customer even at the drive thru window asked if me and my co worker were okay after seeing it happen.He’s 30+ but still seems to throw tantrums when problems could be solved so easy.

So you would assume I could go to my manager, however his wife also works at the same store and is best friends with the manger.So there is literally nothing I can do, she called me and I explained to her what happened but she defended him.Im kind of at a loss for what to do.She won’t believe me or my coworkers whatever we tell her, but surely we can’t just put up with him stomping about and talking down to us?

I feel this feeling of euphoria mixed with anxiety which comes and goes like waves sometimes when it hits a peak a couple hours after taking Elvanse in the morning. 

I used to get this with concerta as well but it was for a moment and I got used to it and it would taper out into a focused energy. Hoping it's the same with Elvanse. It's not a comfortable feeling.
I was kind of hoping it wouldn't be the same with Elvanse. 

Is this what mania feels like though? It must be awful if it is. An example of how I process this feeling is I will feel it rising and get excited about an idea and will go to share it with a friend/coworker and I'll feel like I am compelled to do this and bring change and it feels wonderful for a moment until I'm suddenly slammed back to a depressed /anxious state where I feel frozen. Also like nervous system suddenly kicks in. It comes and goes in waves I'm never really in the euphoric state for long. It lasts a few seconds most of the time before it dips into the icky anxiety/feeling of dread. 

I notice it happens on high doses of concerta for me and when I've had caffeine. It comes and goes. Ive noticed it on 30ng of Elvanse combined with coffee.

1j9mgvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1j9mgvq/why_is_it_normal_for_men_in_this_generation_to/,"Why is it “normal” for men in this generation to casually view porn, and how do I (25f) get over it?","First things first I’m not completely against porn. I think self pleasure is important especially because a partner doesn’t exist to satisfy your every arousal. Porn as a visual aide for masturbation doesn’t bother me. I just don’t need to know about it or see it!

What bothers me is how my boyfriend (25m) can’t scroll on his phone next to me. He is obsessed with his phone and spends hours upon hours a day scrolling. Brings it to the bathroom to use it every time he has to pee. But never scrolls when I’m sitting next to him. 

I’m not stupid or naive, I’ve dated a guy before who did this same thing. In my past relationship, my ex was caught lying about random things all the time and was very protective over his phone. Once my curiosity got the best of me and I felt like I was going insane, I looked through my exes phone and saw that his social media was filled with porn stars, porn, naked women, creepy pages, etc. there was no coming back from seeing all that. It destroyed my confidence and was a huge turn off. 

This current relationship is different in the way that my boyfriend is very honest. He will admit to having porn on his social media accounts, but nothing has changed despite me expressing multiple times that this bothers me. 
When it comes up he downplays it by saying 99% of his feeds are things he’s interested in, cars, movies, politics, etc. but I think that’s where he might be stretching the truth because that doesn’t really make sense. Either way, if you consider how much time he spends on his phone a day he’s still seeing a lot of it. 

What’s hard for me to understand as a woman is this: casually viewing porn when you’re not preparing to masturbate. Like sitting on the couch drinking your morning coffee and scrolling past a sloppy blow job (Let’s be real, no one’s going to just scroll past this content either, especially if they’re following the account for a reason). Or taking a shit while watching a woman’s tits bounce, before scrolling to the next post about politics. Or sitting 6 feet away from your girlfriend in the same room while coming across a video of oiled up anal sex. I mean I really don’t know what comes up, and I really don’t want to, but how is that normal? 

I personally can’t imagine if my social media looked like that. I can’t imagine if by the time I see my boyfriend naked and we’re about to have sex, that his dick is at least the 3rd one of I seen today, every day.

I get tired of repeating myself. After expressing to him that I think following porn material on social media is different than using porn to masturbate, and that I would really like for us to have a relationship where he could use his precious phone while sitting next to me, nothing has changed. I guess this is really important to him so I want to just get over it. In many other ways this man is amazing and one of the best men I’ve ever met. A very sweet and thoughtful boyfriend, we have the best sex I’ve ever had, and despite this specific thing I’m very happy with him. I’m grateful he’s at least honest about it because I have NO desire to ever find out for myself why his phone is glued to his face only when I’m far enough to not see it- I know the answer and I don’t want to see any of it. 

Even though I can’t help but wonder how many pairs of tits he sees in a day and how he’s even excited to see mine, even though this is a turn off for me, I’m not ready to throw in the towel. So I’m left with, how do I get over this and not be bothered by it? In a generation where porn and the sexualization of women is all over the Internet and on every social media, it’s “normalized” for men to behave this way. To him it’s not a big deal. I want to feel like it’s not a big deal either. 

TL;DR!: my(25f) boyfriend(25m) can’t use his phone freely around me because of porn and openly admits to it. How do it let it go?",0,1741792839.0,relationships,41,0.45,False

My goal is simply to spend my money to keep it in Australia where I can. Europe, Asia and Canada when I can't. I'm not boycotting for things I cannot replace entirely (looking at you, Steam.)

Here's what I've found.

Takeaway; avoiding doordash and uber. No Dominos, Macca's, KFC; instead buying from local restaurants and pizza places, chicken shops, Grilld, Red Rooster, Oportos and Zambreros. Local bakeries but also Baker's Delight and Breadtop are staying on my list.

Soft drinks: Pepsi max/diet coke girlie. It's been easy enough to break the addiction and swap to Bundaberg soft drinks and ginger beer (they also do a diet range on some of their drinks which I like.) 

Iced coffee: I'm South Australian, it's a no-brainer. FUIC is owned by Bega and back under Aussie ownership. 

Chips: bye Doritos, Twisties and Smiths.  Thins, CCs, Cheezels and Kettle chips are Aussie owned once more.

Fruit and veg: buy what's in season and it's more likely to be Australian produced. Im shopping at my local market from now on but I understand the privilege I have in being able to access that easily

Phones: Samsung or Oppo over Apple or Google phones 

Streaming: Stan and free to air apps like 7+, 10play are doing alright to replace Netflix and Binge. I'm not watching much these days. Spotify is Swedish and I've used it for years, but for others its an alternative to YouTube/Apple/Amazon music.

Ride services: going back to taxis, mostly cause I'm sick of surge pricing; using Didi if I need it. 

Trying to become less of a consumer anyway and very firmly believe that there's no ethical consumption under capitalism, but I like to think that doing my bit might have some kind of impact. If you read this far, I hope some of it helps. :)

The first couple weeks he did this I didn’t say anything because I figured he’s having fun so whatever but I eventually brought it up because I don’t like sleeping without him/waking up without him. 

He ended up not doing it as often and he’s been coming to bed with me and we just resume playing in the morning.

I waited, waited more, until I fell asleep and woke up at 10am still without him here.

I HATE not sleeping with him. Waking up with him in the mornings and having morning cuddles and kisses is probably my favorite part of every day. I never give him any grief for playing video games since I also do it but I feel like when he goes to I these lengths he’s neglecting our relationship.. i think also what’s bothering me more is that he said it would be one more game and then we’d watch our show together and I stayed up waiting and he never came. If he had said “I think I just want to play video games all night” and communicated so I knew to expect that it’d still make me sad but I wouldn’t be as upset.

I went downstairs to make coffee and he reached out and I just walked past him without a word and he asked why I’m being rude, I asked him why he was rude by never coming to bed when he said he was going to.

Hey MaximizeMe fam!

Ever find yourself **staring at your to-do list**, wishing you were a productivity wizard but feeling more like a cat chasing a laser pointer? 🙃 Yeah, that was me not too long ago. Juggling work, personal projects, and actually having a life felt like an impossible task. Then, I stumbled across a *ridiculously simple* hack that took just 10 seconds and literally saved me 10 hours a week. Spoiler alert: it doesn’t involve buying a fancy planner or waking up at 4am!

Does this sound too good to be true? Hear me out.

**Here's the magic trick:** It's called the ""10-Second Time Block Decision"". 

**Step 1:** Look at your schedule for the day (you have one, right? 😉).

**Step 2:** Pick ONE big task, maybe two, that absolutely needs your attention. Now, cover up everything else. Yep, I mean it. Pretend it's non-existent for now.

**Step 3:** Set a timer for 10 SECONDS. Within those 10 seconds, decide exactly *when* you'll work on that monster of a task and for how long—commit to a starting point and block the time in your calendar.

And voilà! Your brain automatically starts prioritizing what’s most important. It’s crazy how much clarity this little move can bring. Suddenly, you're not just busy—you're productive, ticking off important stuff like the superstar you are. 💪

**Why 10 seconds?** Because it’s long enough to make a decision but short enough to keep procrastination at bay. You can pretty much do this while brushing your teeth or waiting for your coffee to brew.

**Here's what makes it work:**

- **Clarity:** We tend to overthink decisions. This pinpoint focus nudges us to act.
  
- **Momentum:** Focusing on what's crucial helps us avoid the dreaded *busy-work* trap.

- **Flexibility:** There’s no perfect time for deep work—it’s about making it happen.

Now, if you're visual like me and need a tangible boost, try sticking a post-it note on your screen with a single word, like “WRITE” or “CODE,” during your time block. Trust me, it’s like having your own personal cheerleader! 😄

So, who wants to give this a shot? What are your biggest time management challenges, and could this quick hack help? Let’s chat below… or, you know, pretend we're already wildly successful. Either works! 🌟",1,1741792665.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Brewing at home is the most cost-effective option, especially when buying beans in bulk.

I think I’ll be planning my own girl’s day. It’ll be 6 girls total, including myself. I’m located in the middle, so some of the ladies will be driving 2 hours to come hang out for a girl’s day. I’ve given them an open invitation to stay at my home overnight if that’s easier.

I have one question. Since I’m planning it (I do have a MOH, but my sister is not one to take the lead on anything and has no money to her name), do I have to pay for everyone, or how can I put the expectation out there that everyone will be responsible for their meal at least? 

Some interests I have: 
- I love live music (orchestras and jazz)
- I enjoy coffee and wine!
- I am an absolute plant lover. I have great connections in my community. One girl offered to host a private class at the plant store, whether it’s building terrariums or painting ceramic pots. Does that seem fun at all? 
- My florist has a rental space and a “U-pick” garden to make your own floral arrangement. 
- Food is always good! Especially pizza. 
- I like going to casinos and arcades. 
- I enjoy spa days, but those get pricey and people are already driving to my city and not everyone in my group is financially stable. 
- I love all things art, whether it’s glass blowing, painting pottery, art museums, or painting. Would a group class be fun? 
- I like bowling and I’ve always wanted to try axe throwing.

I never saw any bedbugs, even after staying awake at night many many times wirh a flashlight and looking everywhere.

I did move once 6 months ago, becasue of the bad condition of the flat, like the reappearing insects, very old unrenovated house, also it smelled strongly of smoke somehow now and then,, even though I don't  smoke. 

In the new place I took the furniture apart but I didn't see any insects, but I saw these brown stains, which i never noticed before somehow. 

Is this insect poop? Or just coffee stains or sth? Is it definitely not bedbug poop?

I had the exterminator come and he couldn't find any bedbug évidence, but he also couldn't tell me what the stains were. 

I never once saw a bedbug though in the old or the new flat. 

In the new flat I only found one single carpet beetle, 2 book lice and one spider and occasional fruit flies whenever I buy basil in the last 6 months.

I put sticky tape everywhere, but there's nothing on it. And whenever I looked at night I could see nothing. But I still get bites and I smell a sweetish smell in the bedroom. 
I live in western Europe btw.

The relationship was magic, we were very close and i was really there for him, until it wasn't and he ended it. Only to real me back in and dump me again. He said he had too much going on and he would always use him not doing well as an excuse to his shitty behavior. During the break up i also found out he had cheated in other relationships, affairs, lies, etc and dumped all his exes in the same way. 

This was the hardest 6m of my life and tbh it still hurts. I bumped into him a few times and it was pretty chill. He did mention that he's still not doing well mentally. I once tried talking about us 1m into the break up but he would panic and say ""he wasn't in the right headspace to talk about it"" He never was fyi. I could go on about this but you get it. Went back to nc after that. 

Now, i texted him if he wanted to grab a coffee to catch up. I just really wanted to know how he's doing, maybe finally close off a relationship that meant everything to me. I thought after all this time it could be different but no. He didn't reply for 3 days and this morning i got a text sayin ""hi i really have a lot on my head atm so right now is really not the time for me sorry"". 

Should i reply? Ignore? Stretch out my hand and tell him if he needs someone to talk to? I'm so lost. It really feels as if he couldn't give 2 shits about me meanwhile our relationship was very special. I don't get it.

She is runs the Employee Health Clinic which screen all new applicants who are coming into the hospital, and manages all employee health issues.  It's a Human Resources position in it's self.  I have known about her plans to retire for a while, I have just been hoping she would work forever  I love when I have a chance to go up and talk to her about nothing.  LOL  

My bosses boss who is the Director of Nursing over the entire Hospital requested to see me.  During the meeting she said that Lori was getting ready to retire and when asked if Lori had any recommendations for someone to take over her position Lori without missing a beat said my name. The Director knows me.  We have worked together on a couple of issues before  and said that was a great idea.  She went on to tell me it's an administrative position, Monday to Friday maybe a weekend here and there.  Holidays as needed but not many. She said that while I'm close to the top of the pay scale this would put me on salary at the top.

Here's the thing.  I have no interest in administrative position.  I have worked for the hospital I'm at since I was 18.  The only unit I know is the ER.  I started as a Unit Secretary, moved to a Nurse Tech then my nursing degree.  I carry multiple certifications for other jobs like Sonography, ultrasound and phlebotomy.  I work on the trauma team as well. This is my life. This is all I ever know.  

I asked the director if I could think about it and she said yes.  I spoke to my boss about it and she asked if I sustained brain damage from a patient.  This would be a great opportunity for me to grow.  I asked why she wasn't interested in it.  She said she was also thinking about her retirement. I turned around and threw my best friends name in the mix. I said Lindsay would be perfect for this position as well.  She said she would pass her name on to the Director.  I then went and told Lindsay what I did. She seems very interested. But she asked why I wasn't interested. 

I have no interest in administrative roles.  I don't want the bureaucratic bull shit that the administration has to put up with.  I deal with patients.  While I would still be patient orientated (employees would be my patients)   I truly don't think I could think on a slower scale.  I admit that I'm an adrenaline junkie.  The days I work I survive on Coffee, Diet Coke and Doctor Pepper.  I put my lunch in our breakroom and step in on occasion to grab a bite or two.  I just feel I'm better dealing ER patients than I am anything administrative. I also like having three to four days off.

Why do stepkids steal from you?!!,"I’m in my thirties - I’ve been in a relationship for over a decade with the man of my dreams. We have a child, he also has a daughter from a previous relationship/teen pregnancy. My stepchild has only lived with us full time for the past few years. For context - my stepdaughter hasn’t had it easy, life with her bio mom was rough. They struggled financially among other things, despite our financial support. She’s a polite kid, well behaved for the most part (she’s 17). But she has absolutely no respect for my belongings and boundaries. It started with small things - she would take clothes, expensive makeup, etc without permission. I caught her taking my expensive designer PRESCRIPTION eyeglasses (she doesn’t need/have glasses) to school or when going out with friends, of course… I took them away and told my partner who discussed it with her, it stopped for awhile until one day they were gone again and I never saw them again. Let me be clear - I do NOT misplace things or forget where I put them, I’ve never been like that and it just doesn’t happen. We approached her about it and she denied taking them. Even though I’ve caught her before, there’s photos on her social media of her wearing them etc then in the fall, she took my $60 yeti that I use daily and bring to work, when I go out - everywhere! I asked her where it was and she denied taking it. Meanwhile she took it and used it at school that day. There’s multiple tumbler cups in our house, but she chose to take mine without permission and lie. Lately - it’s been far less frequent, the last time was probably 6 months ago but another example, she took the curling wand I, myself, borrowed from a friend and she also took clothes and a brand new hat I purchased and wore daily when she was going for a couple days with a friend. Her father was proactive and as soon as she was home approached her and made her return the items. Taking big items has so far, seemed to stop - but then there’s small situations like when I buy things for coffee for the week for myself, I make iced coffee at home and daily before work… I bought creamer that is almost $10 per bottle (this bottle would have lasted me the week for work) I opened it and made 1 coffee and I came home that day after work and the creamer was emptied, her father doesn’t drink cream in his coffee so it was her, this has happened 3 times in the last month. I know keep my coffee items at work. That really pisses me off, I shouldn’t have to feel like I can’t keep anything in my own home. I know it’s only coffee creamer, but it’s the fact that it’s mine and she doesn’t even ask to use some, she just does what she wants, never mind the fact that she completely empties the bottle in one day. There’s other situations also not involving stealing but just complete disrespect, like when I clean up after this child who doesn’t do a damn thing for themselves despite their age and capability… I cleaned up our shared main bathroom, this child had clothes ALL over the floor in there one day, I picked them up and put them in a hamper so I could clean my washroom because I was doing housework anyway, 3 hours later the child goes in there looking for something and dumps all the clothes I picked up out of the hamper and leaves them all over the floor again. I don’t know anymore. Some times, my partner is on my side, but lately it turns in to an argument and I get told I’m accusing and attacking her. Meanwhile it always is, 100% HER that does it. It’s not him, and our child together is quite a bit younger so it’s not them either. Am I crazy for being so upset? I feel like I’m being walked all over and disrespected but when I speak up I’m made to feel like I’m in the wrong. For context, this child doesn’t go to school, doesn’t work, barely cleans up after themself etc at 17!!!! I’m losing my fucking mind. ",1,1741791715.0,stepparents,12,0.67,False

1j9m0ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/vermont/comments/1j9m0ij/a_cheap_pathway_toward_amnesty_for_tesla_owners/,A cheap pathway toward amnesty for Tesla owners of Vermont.,"Hello Comrades,

Whelp March 12th, another day of new economic lockdowns in the name of public health. Trump's trade quarantines against the world should begin having an effect on the opium trade with China any day now―we'll see who wins this round. 

But we're not here to talk about how our economy woke up and began ""TRANS[itioning]"" under Trump, we're here to figure out wha tto do with the swasticars that we had so much fun of this last month. 

A lot of people missed some of the signs about Elon Musk (over the decades) and became personally financially encumbered in his ideology. And they now they are stuck driving around in a symbol of their mistake, which is awkward for everyone. Like when someone's paypal account gets frozen and everyone just makes fun of them because that's what paypal does.

First. Anyone that can afford to sell their Tesla for any price and buy a new car can just do that―no problem. You don't need amnesty, if you have enough money―'this is America! Just hit send in the app.

Alternatively, locking in a high value donation to a local technical school could be a good way to write down a liability―if there's still an IRS. 

But if the beginning of a recession is not a good financial time for your family, and flipping a vehicle isn't practical financially, there is another way to mark the deprecation in the asset for the books in real life. 

**It's perfectly socially acceptable to own a Tesla, in Vermont, for religious reasons.**

In the United States, everyone has perfect religious freedom to believe WHATEVER they like, including that Elon Musk is the AntiChrist and his loyal followers will be protected in the end times.

If this is the case, please, just let the rest of us know and we'll stop making fun of you... no one will mock you for your religion in Vermont.

Place the mark of the anti-christ (𝕏) on your Tesla, that will be the sign. 

Mark all six sides of your Tesla, so if someone is PoVing overhead, or the vehicle gets flipped, we'll know that you are just a follower of the new Christ and not a Nazi―you'll be as good as one of us.

Treat his mark is the blood of the lamb of freedom and no harm can come to you or your family if you accept it.

But, remember, this is your religion, there are NO RULES. Or rather, they're only rules you make up. 

There can be an upside down メ on the hood, so that it makes a cross visible to the driver. There is no need to stop at one Ｘ on each side, it could be a maximalist wall of xs. It's essentially free art therapy for the cost of a paint pen. The paint pen can just live in the cup holder, or it can be a family activity. It can be a scribble and sip. There are no mistakes, mistakes are good actually. 

It could be like in elementary school where someone broke a bone and everyone signed their cast, except it could be ""I'm broke, so you all have to come mark my Tesla"".

Your Tesla can be a corpus of adornment that expands over months and years. 

To help clue everyone into your religious views, it may be helpful to add some context to the marks, like:

- ""Accept his mark"" 
- ""Elon loves you."" 
- ""Elon gets you.""
- ""Hail Khrist.""
- ""Behold, here is the Khrist""
- ""Behold, He is there""
- ""Hodl 𝕏""

Your goto bible verses (that can sprinkled in anywhere to show that it's a real prophesy and that you're a real religious follower) are as follows:

- Revelation 13:17
- John 4:3
- 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4
- Revelation 13:2
- 2 John 1:7

If you meet a redditor in real life, they may hail you by saying:

> ""Hello Khristian!""

To which the standard response shall be:

> ""Hail Elon! Behold, he is the Khrist. Lead us into temptation and deliver us through evil.""

Or just:

""Behold!""

It is **NOT** decorous to EVER give your heart way, only Khrist should do that gesture.

***

Everyone wants to see your rolling art project. 

It can be posted to any social media that has curated feeds like tiktoc, 𝕏.com, insta or reddit. There should be a timelapse and a behind the scenes.

Facebook will be the goldmine of engagement. It would probably be good to have a Facebook group for doing Christ and Coffee meetups throughout Vermont, in places like Shelburne, Stowe, Woodstock, Manchester, and Killington (anywhere with SuperChargers really).

***

A ""first pass"" deadline for this statewide collaborative art project will be April 12th. They should definitely be well underway by Earth Day 2025.

DO NOT VANDALIZE OTHER PEOPLES' PROPERTY (WITHOUT PERMISSION). 

DON'T LET ANYONE ADMONISH YOU FOR YOUR FAITH, or try to make it political. Remember your catchphrases: ""Behold, He is there"". When you've made it clear you're in a cult, you'll have an opportunity to pivot to listen and ask questions about your neighbor and what their world is like. You can use your rolling conversation piece as a way to connect.

For the last few years I \[30\] have been a full-time carer for my father \[83\]. My relatives didn’t help me and felt completely isolated with the disease known as dementia. My father was always kind to me and I wouldn’t have had it any other way, I enjoyed the time we spent together despite the hardships.

Now he is dying and all he needs is peace and quiet and to spend some time with me and my sister. My mother, who is a complete narcissist is trying to hijack an event that should be focused on him, making herself the protagonist and victim as per usual.

She was always violent with dad, throwing hot cups of coffee at him and laughing at the event, she would punch him hard on his chest or manipulate him to do whatever she wanted. She never had any regard towards his money and would spent it freely in clothes or whatever trinket that couldn’t fill her void. So much so that my dad ended up burrowing just to go by. Not to mention the many times she tortured us psychologically with how we weren’t never enough and always craving our love whilst beating us repeatedly when we were younger.

I have always been the ”villain” because from all of my relatives I’m the one that has stood up to her bull and gone NC. My sister has historically been more lenient towards her despite knowing and admitting the same things I do. My family enables and rewards her behaviour. That isolation makes you doubt whether you’re doing the right thing or not.

With the short backstory out of the way. My dad remembers me and my sister the most, he has not mentioned wanting to see my mother at all because he just doesn’t remember her. And being his advocate means I have to take decisions that are best suited for him, yeah even the difficult ones. A concept my mother’s family apparently don’t understand. I don’t want drama at my father’s deathbed and I certainly don’t want someone so awful to even step in and my decision is for her not to attend his deathbed. Despite my warnings that she would not be welcome, she‘s going to force herself against his best interests.

My family thinks I’m cruel when all I want is what’s best for dad. I just don’t want to feel isolated anymore in my decisions.",1,1741791643.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

TIM: I’m really glad ur here to help

TIM: also sorry its such a fuckin mess I just cant get up to clean with my back hurting

Tim keeps messaging me. It’s really awkward because he’s dead and I’m not sure how to tell him that, or even if I *should* tell him that. Because at this stage, I still don’t know what killed him, just that it’s knocking on the door hoping for me to let it in. There are no other exits to this room. I’m trapped in here with his pungent corpse covered in symbols that he carved into his own flesh, symbols on every part of him except his right arm that holds the knife. Maggots wriggle in and out of his eyes. It's nauseating, and there’s also nowhere to sit but his chair that he is currently congealing into so I’m huddled here against the door trying not to touch any of the dried blood all over the walls, the KNOCK KNOCK KNOCKing pounding on the wood behind me and giving me such a migraine.

Meanwhile my girl, Emma, keeps texting, asking where I am. *At the gym, Babe,* I lie, and hope that’s not the last text I ever send.

In short, I am having a really, really bad day.

But hey, judging by that knocking, it’s also gonna be really, really short!

TIM: I prolly smell… haven’t been able to shower.

I mean, do I *tell* him he’s decomposing and that’s why he stinks? Breathing in here is like sipping a smoothie of rotting meat soaking in sewage and marinating in all those maggots. I wet a bandana in one of the beers I took from his fridge, tie it around my mouth and nose, but now it’s just the eye-watering stink of death with an accent of hops. Strongly considering holding my breath and suffocating.

TIM: Sorry I have to kill u, by the way. Well… let u die.

Oh. Nice of him to come right out with it like that.

ME: Was that the plan all along? Kill me?

TIM: I mean I kinda thought you’d just open the door, u know? Like everyone else.

ME: Like Dwayne.

TIM: I didn’t know he was a kid!

ME: uh huh

TIM: it’s not fair of u to judge me! I didn’t know, ok? And I’m genuinely sorry what’s gonna happen to u there’s just nothing I can do to stop it.

Well then. Apparently Tim *does* realize a lot more than he was letting on, he just doesn’t really like to talk about it. I’m guessing what happened is that he fucked up whatever ritual he was attempting—wrote everything out except on that right arm. So now the entity that he only partially-summoned is trying to use other victims as hosts, killing them in the process. Or else it’s sucking their life out to strengthen itself in order to finish crossing over. Or maybe it’s just hungry. Who knows? Regardless, if it succeeds in manifesting on this side of the door, that’s bad news bears for everyone. I tap onto my phone:

ME: so what happens to me now?

TIM: I mean, u already know… same thing as happened to everyone else

I close my eyes and lean my head against the doorframe and sigh. “Why?” I ask. He doesn’t answer—his eyeballs are leaking out of his head, after all, his eardrums and all those bits and pieces little more than smelly goo. It’s only through the digital interface he’s been able to interact with me. I type into Discord:

ME: why?

TIM: y wut?

ME: why are you doing this? Since I’m going to die anyway… I’d like to know why. What am I dying for?

This is it. I wait for his villain speech. Because if I can get him to tell me *why,* tell me the rules, then maybe there’s some sliver of a chance I can escape this, and I haven’t fucked myself by accepting his friend request and inviting that thing to knock on my door. There’s a long pause where three dots pass across my screen. Tim is writing. He’s writing something long. That or he’s writing and editing, changing his mind. I wait. I wait. And then…

The dots disappear.

Nothing.

Wha… is this fucker *ghosting* me?

ME: Tim?

TIM: I don’t owe you anything

ME: um you literally invited me to my death but won’t tell me why???

TIM: What does it matter since ur gonna die anyway? u got ur fifty so I owe u nothing

ME: Dude, fifty bucks barely covers the Lyft!! I came here FOR YOU. To help you!

TIM: Liar! u never gave a shit about me. ur only here for those other people. u been looking down on me from the second u said hello!

ME: Bro. WTF. I never looked down on u

ME: I dunno who u think I am, but I can promise u I’m in no position to judge anyone.

ME: look, as much as u so clearly hate yourself, I promise u I hate myself more

TIM: who tf says I hate myself???

And suddenly the tension is so thick you could choke on it. The air has gotten colder, and the corpse in the chair has an aura of menace. The overhead lights flicker—apparently it’s not just Discord that Tim’s ghost has some influence over. And as the lights wink off, plunging the room into pitch black save for the foreboding glow of the monitor, I know I have exactly *one* chance to get this right. Weirdly enough, I’m sort of excited. Just like every time I’ve conned someone and been nearly caught—every time the mark was *this close* to slipping off the line. Only right now, it’s not money at stake—it’s my actual life. I just have to hope I’ve got a keen enough read on him to play this right.

I tap onto my screen:

ME: whatever judgment u feel, bro, that’s coming from u. It’s like I’m saying… who am I to judge anyone? honestly, ur probably doing the world a favor taking me out

For a second, it feels like there’s no air in the room at all. Like my heart’s stopped. The silence lengthens and despair blooms in my chest. And then…

TIM: so y do u hate urself?

I let out a breath. OK. OK, Jack. Let’s do this.

Gotta keep Timmy engaged, get him chummy again, get him to lower his guard by convincing him the biggest loser in this room is *me.* And then, once he no longer sees me as a threat, hope he’s got the answers I need to defeat his buddy knocking outside that door. But one step at a time, now, right?

I tell him why I hate myself.

\*\*\*

I love myself!

Maybe not right now. Right now, a few KNOCK KNOCKs away from death, gagging on the leftover beer I just guzzled with my chum the psychotic incel who’s planning to kill me—now’s not me at my best. But on a regular day? Heck yeah, livin’ the dream! This morning I woke up next to the best girl in the world, inhaled the syrupy scent of the best pancakes cooked by the best grandma, rolled out of bed and tripped over the best cat (not that I’m a cat guy, but if I gotta have a cat, this lil’ guy’s the best). Then after breakfast, Emma put a mug of steaming coffee in my hand and kissed my cheek and told me we’ll announce our engagement as soon as I get my GED, so could I please study?

She’s the kind of girl who never met a test she couldn’t ace, high school valedictorian, 4.0 GPA, currently going for her masters in public policy. Me? I dropped out. Just don’t do well with indoctrination. Standardized tests are all pick the right answer A, B, or C and nevermind there’s a whole alphabet out there. No, you gotta tick the right box, color inside the lines, your thinking done for you, so be a good cog in the machine—but baby, put me in a box I’m always gonna claw my way outside it.

Anyway. Point is, Tim Sanders is never gonna relate to the self-made huckster Jack Wilde.

I need to sell him someone on his level.

ME: You know they put me in special ed growing up?

Normally I don’t dig up my skeletons. But right now, for Tim, it’s time to yank those old bones from deep in the closet, from under dirty kids clothes and that elementary school lunchbox that smells like stale bologne. Gross, it’s rank, right? Dig into that skull for all those crusty memories and tell him about a dead kid with a deadname, Jacqueline. (But don’t actually tell him her name or pronouns ‘cause nothing would torpedo this bromance faster.) Tell him about this kid who couldn’t stop fidgeting long enough for fill-in-the-bubble tests, whose teachers and parents all said the same thing: “If you don’t try harder, they’re going to stick you in class with the dumb kids.” And that’s where Jacqueline wound up, with the dumb kids. Saw the score that everyone’s measured by and *Guess what your measure is, kid?*

Failure.

The thing about a good lie is, it’s gotta taste like the truth. My parents wouldn’t recognize me now with my week’s worth of stubble and rugged physique and six-pack. (What’s that, you don’t believe I have a six-pack? Fuck you, I lift. Having a six-pack is my reward for all those workouts. It’s in the fridge.) I joke, but the point is there’s not much of Jacqueline left in Jack. But pulling out these moldy memories gives my tale the tang of truth, a big heaping spoonful of it, and right at the end I slip in a lie:

ME: … I can’t even blame u for tricking me, rly. I’m still doing the same dumb shit.

TIM: bro did u ever get tested for ADHD

ME: is it any surprise I fell for ur tricks so easy? I know im gonna die. I got no one to mourn me so who cares. anyway, since u got me as kind of a captive audience… what’s ur story, Tim?

Tim does not respond at first. I wonder if I hammed it up too much. I prod:

ME: fr man. u cant fuck up worse than me. y u so down on urself? Got anything to do with this knocking?

T: Yeah… yeah I guess it does…

\*\*\*

Six months ago, Tim Sanders was seated in that very same leather gaming chair, gulping down a bottle of the same watery-as-piss beer I recently pulled from his fridge. Back then he was freshly showered and smelled faintly of Old Spice, and put on his headset, eager to voice chat with the girl who was his obsession: Vivienne, aka Viv.

A ghost girl, according to what she told Tim on Discord.

She said she’d died in a car accident but wasn’t able to rest. The world as she experienced it was lonely and strange. She couldn’t touch people. Couldn’t interact with people. The only interaction she could manage was through electronics. *You know how ghosts can cause the lights to flicker and stuff? Well motherboards are the same way, just smaller switches of ones and zeroes. That’s how I can type to you*, she told him online. She said she couldn’t send “real life” photos because she was dead, but she sent AI images that captured what she “used to look like.”

TIM: Check her out…

ME: Hot damn, she’s got nice… eyes. 👀

She has nice tits. Which are 100% fake, just like Viv. Even her voice, which he describes as “ghostly and electronic sounding,” is obviously AI. I’ve sold some whoppers before, but even I am boggled at the way this Viv scammer somehow found the one lonely guy on the internet desperate enough to be suckered into chatting with a “ghost girl.” A ghost girl who repeatedly requested Amazon gift cards and Venmo.

As Tim dreamily describes their chats, there’s this squirmy feeling in my gut that I don’t think is just the piss beer. I’m not used to seeing the sucker’s perspective, seeing the fish swallow the hook while the metal tears his belly open from the inside. He’s dead because someone duped him, and eight other people are dead because of him, and it all comes back to the moment Vivienne ended their cyber affair. The screenshot he sends me of her last message is filled with emojis: *Thank you for everything, I have found my peace and am moving into the ever after.* ❤️ 💞 😘 😘 😘

TIM: I wanted to be happy for her. But Viv leaving really messed me up. She was the love of my life, y’know?

I am grateful that Timmy here can’t see my expressions because the “love of his life?” I drag my hand down my face and side-eye his corpse.

ME: I’m sorry you went through that.

TIM: The thing is…

ME: ?

TIM: This is y I need u to understand. I know ur mad about… about what’s going to happen to u. But this is the only way I can see her again. The thing outside the door…

ME: THAT’S Viv???

TIM: bingo

ME: ur ghost girlfriend is knocking on the door to kill me???

TIM: uh huh

TIM: its my fault really. I fucked up the ritual.

And even as Tim is explaining, telling me how it all went down, how Viv came back wanting to be together, how he fucked it all up with a simple mistake when he didn’t carve both arms… a plan is forming in my mind. A simple, *terrible* plan. Because I am pretty sure I’ve got a way to end the threat of that relentless KNOCK KNOCK KNOCKing on the door behind me.

But I’m going to have to be a shitty person to make it work.

\*\*\*

Karma’s a bitch, y’know? A bitch named Vivienne. But also named Tim. And Jack. We’re all getting what’s coming to us… and it’s all going down right now, because I am going to end this charade by giving Tim *exactly* what he wants.

My knife carves into the mottled flesh of his rotting right arm. It doesn’t bleed—just opens up these dark lines I trace out in the skin. I copy the symbols from the walls at Tim’s instruction. The cuts swim in my vision, and the hairs on my arms stand upright like I’m about to get struck by lightning. I’ve replenished my beer-soaked bandana with the second bottle, but my eyes still water from the smell, and my stomach bucks. I unfortunately did not have the foresight to bring gloves, and when some of his skin sloughs off onto my fingers, I have to stop and shake it off.

Man, this is gross.

Tim, for his part, is over the moon. He kind of can’t believe I’m granting his last wish. I kind of can’t believe it either, and fantasize myself anywhere else. Maybe in a world in which I did as my girl asked and studied. LOL! Might as well fantasize myself six foot tall while I’m at it, with washboard abs. (Not that I don’t have those, I definitely do. In the right lighting. If you squint.)

TIM: holy shit man

TIM: I cannot thank u enough

TIM: like tbh I don’t even know how many ppl she’d have taken if u hadn’t shown up

ME: just wanna help u get reunited and no one else dies, win-win!

But it’s not win-win. And since we’re drawing near to the end of this charade, just a few more arcane symbols left to trace… it’s time I come clean, to you good folks reading at least, before we summon Viv.

\*\*\*

Right, so. For the record, up until *this exact moment,* I wasn’t in any real danger. I mean, was it scary? Yes. And did I scream? Also yes. But that’s because I’m a coward. (It’s a feature not a bug—heroism against the paranormal tends to result in a premature doom. Another reason I don’t like to involve Emma…) The truth is I intentionally got myself “stuck” with Tim, letting him sucker me so I could sucker him, and the situation is kind of like a loaded gun. Sure, it *could* kill me, but consider the rules: Vivienne can’t harm me unless I open the door and invite her in. And just like I wouldn’t pull the trigger on myself—duh, I’m *never* gonna open the door! As for being trapped in this room because of the KNOCKing… realistically, I could call the cops, Emma, anybody. They’re not the invitee, so they could open the door for me and let me out.

Easy peasy.

So yes, I may have overdramatized the danger in the retelling. (Sorry.) But even if I wasn’t actually risking much prior to this moment, I’m about to do something wildly, ridiculously reckless. The proverbial gun is about to go off, with me right in its sights. Because I’m about to summon Vivienne.

She’s not who he thinks she is.

After she left him, he began using ouija boards, seances, and rituals to call into the beyond and beg his beloved to return. He’d been researching the occult since the beginning of their cyber affair, seeking ways of bringing her into the living world. That’s actually *why* she left—he kept pressing her to try rituals to summon her spirit into a vessel, either a doll or a living human she might possess. When the arcane rituals he suggested became more extreme and involved him mutilating himself, Vivienne sent her last text, telling him that she found her peace and was continuing her journey to the beyond.

The catfisher cut the line.

But…

The hook was still embedded deep. And one day, after countless attempts to reach Viv in the beyond…

One day, he heard *knocking.*

ME: how did u know it was Viv?

TIM: cmon man who tf else would answer from the other side??

*Nothing good, Tim, nothing good ever answers from the other side!!!* is what I wanted to scream at him. Enter Viv 2.0. A horrifying entity that drives people to death with terror. Not that I could ever convince Tim this entity is different from original Viv, or that original Viv was a catfisher. To him, they are simply his beloved. Telling him to let Viv go because the relationship was never genuine—it’d be like telling me to let go of Emma. I mean, sure, you can argue that Emma’s real and Viv isn’t—but *she’s real to Tim*. Real enough that he carved his flesh and painted his blood on the walls and already sacrificed eight people for her.

TIM: she promised we’d be together. Soul-bonded. Deeper than any marriage of the flesh. All I had to do was complete the ritual, but I got weak from blood loss and fucked it up…

In reams of text, Tim spills his obsession to me, describing how she appeared in his trances as a sort of shining angel stuck just beyond the door, unable to come through. Unlike the original catfisher, who used Discord to message him, Viv 2.0 could only communicate by sending images and sensations into his mind. She gave him visions of what to do. It took him weeks to understand her arcane communications. Eventually he learned the symbols.

When he finally attempted the ritual that would summon Viv 2.0 into this world, he succumbed to blood loss before he could finish, leaving the summoning incomplete. Since then, he has been reaching out through Discord on her behalf. Every new victim who opens the door to Viv 2.0 gives her just a little more power, a little more access to the world, bringing her closer to manifesting.

Tim is in many ways a classic ghost. Sure, he’s more lucid than most, and his ability to communicate through messaging is rare (likely boosted by his connection to Viv 2.0 and his overall familiarity with the “other side” prior to his death). Even so, like most ghosts, he’s bound geographically to the place he died, able to interact with the physical world only in limited ways, and—as often happens with spirits—he keeps forgetting he’s dead. That’s why he keeps citing his hurt back as the reason he can’t get up from his chair. As a result, it hasn’t occurred to him that a corpse may not be an ideal vessel for Vivienne. That she was expecting a living human to possess, and that fulfilling the ritual *now* after he’s been rotting for over a week… might not be to her liking.

*I* certainly haven’t enlightened him. Because as much as a part of me pities him, I think of Lucia and Dwayne and the others who answered the knocking, the people who didn’t get a choice when they died screaming.

And now, the beer tastes sour in my mouth as I make the final cuts. I swallow the last dregs of the bottle, bringing back the buzz to kill my conscience.

ME: Ready?

TIM: Jack, I love u man. ur a real one.

As I trace the last line, all the hairs on my body stick straight up. My flesh crawls as if a million ants wriggle and squirm just beneath the skin. There’s a phrase I have to repeat three times. Tim types it out phonetically and has me practice. It includes a particular string of syllables that makes the strangest shape in my mouth, and I’m pretty sure that’s the word for Viv—practicing it sends a sensation like an icepick in my brain. Once I’ve got it, I step just outside the center of the spiral of bloody symbols around that room and tug down my beer-soaked bandana to utter a chant that translates roughly to:

“Forever together, >!\[indecipherable\]!<. Forever together, >!\[indecipherable\]!<. Forever together, >!\[indecipherable\]!<.”

As the phrase leaves my lips for the third time, the room feels strange. It takes me an unsettling moment to realize why.

The knocking has stopped.

\*\*\*

After ceaseless hours of KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCKing rattling around in my skull without respite, you’d think silence would be a relief. A blessing.

Instead I am chilled to the marrow. I look at my phone. The low-battery warning flashes. Ignoring that, I type:

ME: Tim?

ME: Did it work? R u still there? Is Viv with u?

Nothing.

The body in the chair hasn’t moved. Flies crawl in and out of his sockets. Suddenly I feel very alone. Just me and a rotting corpse. I back away from him, glancing at his glowing monitor. Our Discord chat is up, but no further activity. No three dots. No response.

After a few minutes of standing stock still and petrified, I finally lean over the dead guy and peck at a few keys, checking his message history for any other victims, then turning off the computer. In the dark screen, I catch a glimpse of my face. Anxious black eyes. Stubble. Spatters of grime. I look shifty, like a thief plotting his getaway. I lean down and disconnect the router and modem. Unplug all the power cords and cut through them with the knife. Remove the ethernet cable and tuck it into my hoodie. There is no way, natural or supernatural, for this computer to connect to the internet anymore.

I head for the door and grasp the knob. When I feel no goosebumps along my arms, no chill of supernatural energy, I *puuuulllll* the door slowly open.

Nothing happens.

Well. This was anticlimactic.

I turn and step out the door and shut it behind me, all but whistling, relief washing over me—

*THUMP*

I fucking knew it….

I should absolutely *not* open the door again and peek back inside. Absolutely not. I should just leave, go on my merry way, and whatever happens, happens…

But as we all know, I am an idiot.

I open the door.

Silently, cautiously, a jackal nervously peeking into the den of a bear, I poke my head into the room. It’s dark, so I open the door wider to let the light in.

The chair at his desk is empty.

Fuuuuu—

It’s empty, and the electronics are still dead so *where is he, Jack? Where the fuck did the dead man now possessed by the knocker go? He must still be in this cramped room but he’s not in the chair and—*

And I look up.

\*\*\*

There are certain moments in life that tell you exactly what sort of mettle a man is made of. Whether he is chiseled stone or rough leather. Whether he has a spine of iron or steel—moments of crisis where a man’s true nature comes out.

I shriek at the top of my lungs. The tippy top. I’m talking notes that choir boys couldn’t hit. Somewhere I think glass breaks.

Tim—the corpse—is crawling on the ceiling above me, flies buzzing in his sockets and mouth open and teeth bared, his rotting body leaking fluids.

He drops on me.

His corpse, by the way, is massively heavy. He’s over six foot and thickly built, and when his full weight crashes down it’s like being hit by a bus. There’s this horrible shrill ringing in my ears. I don’t know if it’s from his shrieks or mine—maybe both—and for a moment everything in my vision goes white, and it’s like my soul is being drawn up out of my body. I see myself, pinned under that rotting dead guy, his mouth wide and screaming in my screaming face. Then there’s this reddish glow emanating off the ink on my arm. It’s my tattoo. The portrait of the Lady on my arm is like a brand marking me as hers. Her mark won’t stop the entity from killing me, but the crimson glow briefly distracts it from whatever it’s doing. And with everything I got, I *heave*. Thank God for adrenaline, thank God I’ve been hitting the gym so hard, and thanks especially for the air that I gulp in the second I heave him off me, one deep precious breath before I’m running. Feet pounding down the hallway—

I collide with a petite black-haired girl.

“Jack!” Emma shrieks as we rebound off each other, my momentum taking me into the wall while she sprawls on the floor.

“Emma, what are you—”

“Duck!” Her shrill cry pierces my ears, and that’s when I see the shotgun glinting in her hands as she swings the barrel up. There’s a thunderous crack, an explosion of gore from the monstrosity lumbering behind me. He barely sways, and she fires again, and then I grab her arm and scream, “RUN, RUN!” and we run.

The shots seem to have stunned him. We make it out the front door. My battered old car is in the driveway—Emma had the foresight to take my vehicle instead of her newer electric blue hybrid. I race for the trunk where I keep all my gear and grab a gas can. And Emma, bless her, she gapes at me, her dark eyes wide and her long hair tangling around her face, but when I babble that we need to burn the place and that zombie-thing in it she nods and grabs a bottle of vodka from the back and stuffs a rag in. As we head back to the house she gasps, “I thought you were supposed to be *studying*…”

“Long story.”

“I know, I saw the chats on your laptop. ‘At the gym’ my ass.”

I smile at her. She’s tiny and furious. With her black eyes narrowed and that shotgun tight in her grip. This girl… man, I love this girl. She never looks hotter than when she’s saving my ass.

I open the door.

Emma levels the shotgun, covering me while I sprinkle gas around the stacks of boxes, soiled carpet, stained and sagging couch and furniture. No sign yet of any—

“RRRRAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGHHH!!!”

The scream is so loud Emma and I both jump and scramble. I can’t hear my heart sledgehammering my ribs, or the question Emma shouts at me. I can’t hear anything except that howl. It’s the most terrible sound in the world. And when I force myself to ignore all my instincts and follow that sound down the hall, Emma tugs my arm, but I ignore her. I somehow already know what I will find. I push open the door at the end of the hall. And there he is. He’s slumped in the corner, in the center of all those spiraling symbols, his jaw unhinged in a wide and terrible scream. He doesn’t see me. Doesn’t seem to have any sense of my presence. I scatter the contents of the gas can around, and when I near him and fling a little on him, his head turns. The sightless sockets stare into mine. But he doesn’t stop screaming. He doesn’t come after me. Just screams and screams.

I light the Molotov.

Later Emma will ask me what *was* that monstrosity. And I’ll tell her what I know about Viv 2.0, aka, the knocker: that it is an inhuman entity that, when it manifests, drives people out of their minds with fear. That I knew “being together” with this entity could only have an immediate and detrimental effect on Tim. That I didn’t know whether his soul would be consumed like a minnow swallowed by a bigger fish, or whether he’d experience the same mindfucking horror as Dwayne and Lucia only… ongoing. All I knew was that Tim would keep killing unless I put an end to his fantasy, and that rather than deal with an incorporeal menace reaching people through the internet, the best way to neutralize him was to trap his beloved Viv within his rotting vessel. And then, destroy them both.

I hurl the Molotov and he lights up.

Emma and I back out of there as fast as we can. My last glimpse is of his huddled corpse, arms outstretched in agony, head thrown back as the bright flames lick around him, flesh bubbling and charring.

Long after he’s toast… long after I imagine he must be just charred bones while the fire roars to the sky and the house burns… still, I hear those screams, ringing through my consciousness, and I wonder if it’s him or just my guilty conscience.

\*\*\*

“—you could have died! I mean, if I’d found you, screaming and dead like Dwayne? Or Lucia? *It almost happened!”*

It’s evening now, and Emma and I are both back home and cleaned up. I had to shower twice to rinse off the terrible stench. Boo the cat is settled in my lap on the sofa—he seems to know the threat is gone now. He’ll be going to a foster home soon. For now I’m keeping him confined here in my office in the basement. And Emma—Emma is chewing me out, rightfully so. It doesn’t matter that I remind her that I wasn’t going to open that door. I even had a backup plan. The knocking had a limited geographic range, so if I couldn’t maneuver the information out of Tim, an easy way to save myself would be to take a trip out of state until I could come up with a better plan. It was only at the very end that I was at risk. She is still angry though.

She paces in front of me and bursts, “Why are we having this same damned conversation when you promised me, last time, you *promised* me—""

“I know, Babe.”

“Don’t just ‘I know Babe’ when you could have…” Tears stop her from continuing.

“I didn’t tell you because I was scared of you getting involved. I *know* it was selfish.” She opens her mouth to add a comment, and I pre-empt her, “Selfish *and* stupid. It’s just… you’re brilliant, ok? You’ve got this amazing future ahead of you. You’re in this grad program and you’re dedicated and talented and just so fucking smart. You are going to change the world. I can see it. And like, what would I be, to take your light out of the world? To let my mistakes be the reason your life is snuffed out before you even get a chance to shine?”

That somewhat defuses her anger. Emma can’t help but glow at compliments—it’s the teacher’s pet in her. She considers me. “Wow that’s… very poetic of you.”

“But it’s the truth.”

I mean every word. If there’s any hope for this world, it’s with people like Emma trying to make it better.

She sinks next me on the cushions. “So why can’t you see that you’re a light in the world, too?”

“Uh…” I smile. “’Cause that’s super corny and I… don’t like popcorn.”

Her lips purse. “Ok, well that’s a lie, I’ve seen you go through a whole bucket without sharing. Also, you’re all about ‘Oh I’m Jack Wilde, I can’t be tamed, I do what I want’—” I laugh at her faux-deep-voice, and she goes on: “… and I love and admire that about you. But *why* is it so easy for you to risk your life, and so hard to risk mine? Jack, why do you act like the world would be a better place without you in it?”

Huh.

My mind blanks like I’ve been sucker punched. And while my brain’s spinning like an empty hamster wheel, the only thought that surfaces is Tim’s final shriek. He was a delusional asshole who let people die so he could be with his “beloved.” But he was also just a dude who was lonely and broken in a dysfunctional world that breaks people. What happened to him only happened because he wasn’t smart enough to see through the lies that were told to him by someone slyer than he was.

Someone like me.

Later, I’m in the bathroom and I catch a glimpse of my ink. Coyote on the right arm, Lady and a snake on the left. People always think that’s Eve. Nope, originally it was just the snake, to symbolize Satan, the original trickster (what? Look I was going through some stuff at the time…). But after I made my bargain with the demon that always appears to me as a gorgeous [Lady in red](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15wmuwv/i_have_a_million_dollars_and_one_week_to_live_how/), after I won her game and she swore to catch me, she marked me with her image. I generally try not to look at that tattoo because I don’t like to be reminded. I force myself to look now because I am sick of running from my misdeeds.

She’s already waiting to catch my eye. Her inked lips curving in a wicked smile. That arm aches.

Karma’s a bitch. And no matter what I do, how fast I run or who I save or who I slaughter or how I try to pay my debt to the world, she’s going to catch [me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)",6,1741791594.0,Odd_directions,2,1.0,False

My situation: I had a night of heart palpitations that I’ve never really experienced before and I thought for sure something was wrong.

I work from home so I would drink the coffee because it was there but now that I think about it I was probably drinking 6-8 cups of coffee a day. 

The following days of the event when I drank zero coffee I didn’t have any symptoms.  But I tried a cup of green tea and I started feeling flutters again.

We eat lunch together, take breaks together, chat after work, give each other presents and all the things friends do. He never had a problem eating lunch with me alone and we always sat at a table at the end of the common areas, people know we are good friends and nobody ever said anything negative about us (that I know).

It all started last week. We took our lunches and he said ""let's sit at that table with all the people"". He did this every day. Today in the morning we went for a coffee and he said ""let's join that group"". Today he didn't even sit with me at lunch but he still writes me privately and acts as if all was fine but I don't know what to think of this. I don't want to ask him directly because I'm worried it will only make things worse, like, maybe there is a rumor about us and he said he doesn't want to date anyone at work, etc...

Do you think his behavior is weird? Just to be clear, I have a lot of good friends here so it's not a problem to have lunch in a big group, it's just weird that after so many years his behavior has changed radically. AIO?

TIM: I’m really glad ur here to help

TIM: also sorry its such a fuckin mess I just cant get up to clean with my back hurting

Tim keeps messaging me. It’s really awkward because he’s dead and I’m not sure how to tell him that, or even if I *should* tell him that. Because at this stage, I still don’t know what killed him, just that it’s knocking on the door hoping for me to let it in. There are no other exits to this room. I’m trapped in here with his pungent corpse covered in symbols that he carved into his own flesh, symbols on every part of him except his right arm that holds the knife. Maggots wriggle in and out of his eyes. It's nauseating, and there’s also nowhere to sit but his chair that he is currently congealing into so I’m huddled here against the door trying not to touch any of the dried blood all over the walls, the KNOCK KNOCK KNOCKing pounding on the wood behind me and giving me such a migraine.

Meanwhile my girl, Emma, keeps texting, asking where I am. *At the gym, Babe,* I lie, and hope that’s not the last text I ever send.

In short, I am having a really, really bad day.

But hey, judging by that knocking, it’s also gonna be really, really short!

TIM: I prolly smell… haven’t been able to shower.

I mean, do I *tell* him he’s decomposing and that’s why he stinks? Breathing in here is like sipping a smoothie of rotting meat soaking in sewage and marinating in all those maggots. I wet a bandana in one of the beers I took from his fridge, tie it around my mouth and nose, but now it’s just the eye-watering stink of death with an accent of hops. Strongly considering holding my breath and suffocating.

TIM: Sorry I have to kill u, by the way. Well… let u die.

Oh. Nice of him to come right out with it like that.

ME: Was that the plan all along? Kill me?

TIM: I mean I kinda thought you’d just open the door, u know? Like everyone else.

ME: Like Dwayne.

TIM: I didn’t know he was a kid!

ME: uh huh

TIM: it’s not fair of u to judge me! I didn’t know, ok? And I’m genuinely sorry what’s gonna happen to u there’s just nothing I can do to stop it.

Well then. Apparently Tim *does* realize a lot more than he was letting on, he just doesn’t really like to talk about it. I’m guessing what happened is that he fucked up whatever ritual he was attempting—wrote everything out except on that right arm. So now the entity that he only partially-summoned is trying to use other victims as hosts, killing them in the process. Or else it’s sucking their life out to strengthen itself in order to finish crossing over. Or maybe it’s just hungry. Who knows? Regardless, if it succeeds in manifesting on this side of the door, that’s bad news bears for everyone. I tap onto my phone:

ME: so what happens to me now?

TIM: I mean, u already know… same thing as happened to everyone else

I close my eyes and lean my head against the doorframe and sigh. “Why?” I ask. He doesn’t answer—his eyeballs are leaking out of his head, after all, his eardrums and all those bits and pieces little more than smelly goo. It’s only through the digital interface he’s been able to interact with me. I type into Discord:

ME: why?

TIM: y wut?

ME: why are you doing this? Since I’m going to die anyway… I’d like to know why. What am I dying for?

This is it. I wait for his villain speech. Because if I can get him to tell me *why,* tell me the rules, then maybe there’s some sliver of a chance I can escape this, and I haven’t fucked myself by accepting his friend request and inviting that thing to knock on my door. There’s a long pause where three dots pass across my screen. Tim is writing. He’s writing something long. That or he’s writing and editing, changing his mind. I wait. I wait. And then…

The dots disappear.

Nothing.

Wha… is this fucker *ghosting* me?

ME: Tim?

TIM: I don’t owe you anything

ME: um you literally invited me to my death but won’t tell me why???

TIM: What does it matter since ur gonna die anyway? u got ur fifty so I owe u nothing

ME: Dude, fifty bucks barely covers the Lyft!! I came here FOR YOU. To help you!

TIM: Liar! u never gave a shit about me. ur only here for those other people. u been looking down on me from the second u said hello!

ME: Bro. WTF. I never looked down on u

ME: I dunno who u think I am, but I can promise u I’m in no position to judge anyone.

ME: look, as much as u so clearly hate yourself, I promise u I hate myself more

TIM: who tf says I hate myself???

And suddenly the tension is so thick you could choke on it. The air has gotten colder, and the corpse in the chair has an aura of menace. The overhead lights flicker—apparently it’s not just Discord that Tim’s ghost has some influence over. And as the lights wink off, plunging the room into pitch black save for the foreboding glow of the monitor, I know I have exactly *one* chance to get this right. Weirdly enough, I’m sort of excited. Just like every time I’ve conned someone and been nearly caught—every time the mark was *this close* to slipping off the line. Only right now, it’s not money at stake—it’s my actual life. I just have to hope I’ve got a keen enough read on him to play this right.

I tap onto my screen:

ME: whatever judgment u feel, bro, that’s coming from u. It’s like I’m saying… who am I to judge anyone? honestly, ur probably doing the world a favor taking me out

For a second, it feels like there’s no air in the room at all. Like my heart’s stopped. The silence lengthens and despair blooms in my chest. And then…

TIM: so y do u hate urself?

I let out a breath. OK. OK, Jack. Let’s do this.

Gotta keep Timmy engaged, get him chummy again, get him to lower his guard by convincing him the biggest loser in this room is *me.* And then, once he no longer sees me as a threat, hope he’s got the answers I need to defeat his buddy knocking outside that door. But one step at a time, now, right?

I tell him why I hate myself.

\*\*\*

I love myself!

Maybe not right now. Right now, a few KNOCK KNOCKs away from death, gagging on the leftover beer I just guzzled with my chum the psychotic incel who’s planning to kill me—now’s not me at my best. But on a regular day? Heck yeah, livin’ the dream! This morning I woke up next to the best girl in the world, inhaled the syrupy scent of the best pancakes cooked by the best grandma, rolled out of bed and tripped over the best cat (not that I’m a cat guy, but if I gotta have a cat, this lil’ guy’s the best). Then after breakfast, Emma put a mug of steaming coffee in my hand and kissed my cheek and told me we’ll announce our engagement as soon as I get my GED, so could I please study?

She’s the kind of girl who never met a test she couldn’t ace, high school valedictorian, 4.0 GPA, currently going for her masters in public policy. Me? I dropped out. Just don’t do well with indoctrination. Standardized tests are all pick the right answer A, B, or C and nevermind there’s a whole alphabet out there. No, you gotta tick the right box, color inside the lines, your thinking done for you, so be a good cog in the machine—but baby, put me in a box I’m always gonna claw my way outside it.

Anyway. Point is, Timmy here is never gonna relate to the self-made huckster Jack.

I need to sell him someone on his level.

ME: You know they put me in special ed growing up?

Normally I don’t dig up my skeletons. But right now, for Tim, it’s time to yank those old bones from deep in the closet, from under dirty kids clothes and that elementary school lunchbox that smells like stale bologne. Gross, it’s rank, right? Dig into that skull for all those crusty memories and tell him about a dead kid with a deadname, Jacqueline. (But don’t actually tell him her name or pronouns ‘cause nothing would torpedo this bromance faster.) Tell him about this kid who couldn’t stop fidgeting long enough for fill-in-the-bubble tests, whose teachers and parents all said the same thing: “If you don’t try harder, they’re going to stick you in class with the dumb kids.” And that’s where Jacqueline wound up, with the dumb kids. Saw the score that everyone’s measured by and *Guess what your measure is, kid?*

Failure.

The thing about a good lie is, it’s gotta taste like the truth. My parents wouldn’t recognize me now with my week’s worth of stubble and rugged physique and six-pack. (What’s that, you don’t believe I have a six-pack? Fuck you, I lift. Having a six-pack is my reward for all those workouts. It’s in the fridge.) I joke, but the point is there’s not much of Jacqueline left in Jack. But pulling out these moldy memories gives my tale the tang of truth, a big heaping spoonful of it, and right at the end I slip in a lie:

ME: … I can’t even blame u for tricking me, rly. I’m still doing the same dumb shit.

TIM: bro did u ever get tested for ADHD

ME: is it any surprise I fell for ur tricks so easy? I know im gonna die. I got no one to mourn me so who cares. anyway, since u got me as kind of a captive audience… what’s ur story, Tim?

Tim does not respond at first. I wonder if I hammed it up too much. I prod:

ME: fr man. u cant fuck up worse than me. y u so down on urself? Got anything to do with this knocking?

T: Yeah… yeah I guess it does…

\*\*\*

Six months ago, Tim was seated in that very same leather gaming chair, gulping down a bottle of the same watery-as-piss beer I recently pulled from his fridge. Back then he was freshly showered and smelled faintly of Old Spice, and put on his headset, eager to voice chat with the girl who was his obsession: Vivienne, aka Viv.

A ghost girl, according to what she told Tim on Discord.

She said she’d died in a car accident but wasn’t able to rest. The world as she experienced it was lonely and strange. She couldn’t touch people. Couldn’t interact with people. The only interaction she could manage was through electronics. *You know how ghosts can cause the lights to flicker and stuff? Well motherboards are the same way, just smaller switches of ones and zeroes. That’s how I can type to you*, she told him online. She said she couldn’t send “real life” photos because she was dead, but she sent AI images that captured what she “used to look like.”

TIM: Check her out…

ME: Hot damn, she’s got nice… eyes. 👀

She has nice tits. Which are 100% fake, just like Viv. Even her voice, which he describes as “ghostly and electronic sounding,” is obviously AI. I’ve sold some whoppers before, but even I am boggled at the way this Viv scammer somehow found the one lonely guy on the internet desperate enough to be suckered into chatting with a “ghost girl.” A ghost girl who repeatedly requested Amazon gift cards and Venmo.

As Tim dreamily describes their chats, there’s this squirmy feeling in my gut that I don’t think is just the piss beer. I’m not used to seeing the sucker’s perspective, seeing the fish swallow the hook while the metal tears his belly open from the inside. He’s dead because someone duped him, and eight other people are dead because of him, and it all comes back to the moment Vivienne ended their cyber affair. The screenshot he sends me of her last message is filled with emojis: *Thank you for everything, I have found my peace and am moving into the ever after.* ❤️ 💞 😘 😘 😘

TIM: I wanted to be happy for her. But Viv leaving really messed me up. She was the love of my life, y’know?

I am grateful that Timmy here can’t see my expressions because the “love of his life?” I drag my hand down my face and side-eye his corpse.

ME: I’m sorry you went through that.

TIM: The thing is…

ME: ?

TIM: This is y I need u to understand. I know ur mad about… about what’s going to happen to u. But this is the only way I can see her again. The thing outside the door…

ME: THAT’S Viv???

TIM: bingo

ME: ur ghost girlfriend is knocking on the door to kill me???

TIM: uh huh

TIM: its my fault really. I fucked up the ritual.

And even as Tim is explaining, telling me how it all went down, how Viv came back wanting to be together, how he fucked it all up with a simple mistake when he didn’t carve both arms… a plan is forming in my mind. A simple, *terrible* plan. Because I am pretty sure I’ve got a way to end the threat of that relentless KNOCK KNOCK KNOCKing on the door behind me.

But I’m going to have to be a shitty person to make it work.

\*\*\*

Karma’s a bitch, y’know? A bitch named Vivienne. But also named Tim. And Jack. We’re all getting what’s coming to us… and it’s all going down right now, because I am going to end this charade by giving Tim *exactly* what he wants.

My knife carves into the mottled flesh of his rotting right arm. It doesn’t bleed—just opens up these dark lines I trace out in the skin. I copy the symbols from the walls at Tim’s instruction. The cuts swim in my vision, and the hairs on my arms stand upright like I’m about to get struck by lightning. I’ve replenished my beer-soaked bandana with the second bottle, but my eyes still water from the smell, and my stomach bucks. I unfortunately did not have the foresight to bring gloves, and when some of his skin sloughs off onto my fingers, I have to stop and shake it off.

Man, this is gross.

Tim, for his part, is over the moon. He kind of can’t believe I’m granting his last wish. I kind of can’t believe it either, and fantasize myself anywhere else. Maybe in a world in which I did as my girl asked and studied. LOL! Might as well fantasize myself six foot tall while I’m at it, with washboard abs. (Not that I don’t have those, I definitely do. In the right lighting. If you squint.)

TIM: holy shit man

TIM: I cannot thank u enough

TIM: like tbh I don’t even know how many ppl she’d have taken if u hadn’t shown up

ME: just wanna help u get reunited and no one else dies, win-win!

But it’s not win-win. And since we’re drawing near to the end of this charade, just a few more arcane symbols left to trace… it’s time I come clean, to you good folks reading at least, before we summon Viv.

\*\*\*

Right, so. For the record, up until *this exact moment,* I wasn’t in any real danger. I mean, was it scary? Yes. And did I scream? Also yes. But that’s because I’m a coward. (It’s a feature not a bug—heroism against the paranormal tends to result in a premature doom. Another reason I don’t like to involve Emma…) The truth is I intentionally got myself “stuck” with Tim, letting him sucker me so I could sucker him, and the situation is kind of like a loaded gun. Sure, it *could* kill me, but consider the rules: Vivienne can’t harm me unless I open the door and invite her in. And just like I wouldn’t pull the trigger on myself—duh, I’m *never* gonna open the door! As for being trapped in this room because of the KNOCKing… realistically, I could call the cops, Emma, anybody. They’re not the invitee, so they could open the door for me and let me out.

Easy peasy.

So yes, I may have overdramatized the danger in the retelling. (Sorry.) But even if I wasn’t actually risking much prior to this moment, I’m about to do something wildly, ridiculously reckless. The proverbial gun is about to go off, with me right in its sights. Because I’m about to summon Vivienne.

She’s not who he thinks she is.

After she left him, he began using ouija boards, seances, and rituals to call into the beyond and beg his beloved to return. He’d been researching the occult since the beginning of their cyber affair, seeking ways of bringing her into the living world. That’s actually *why* she left—he kept pressing her to try rituals to summon her spirit into a vessel, either a doll or a living human she might possess. When the arcane rituals he suggested became more extreme and involved him mutilating himself, Vivienne sent her last text, telling him that she found her peace and was continuing her journey to the beyond.

The catfisher cut the line.

But…

The hook was still embedded deep. And one day, after countless attempts to reach Viv in the beyond…

One day, he heard *knocking.*

ME: how did u know it was Viv?

TIM: cmon man who tf else would answer from the other side??

*Nothing good, Tim, nothing good ever answers from the other side!!!* is what I wanted to scream at him. Enter Viv 2.0. A horrifying entity that drives people to death with terror. Not that I could ever convince Tim this entity is different from original Viv, or that original Viv was a catfisher. To him, they are simply his beloved. Telling him to let Viv go because the relationship was never genuine—it’d be like telling me to let go of Emma. I mean, sure, you can argue that Emma’s real and Viv isn’t—but *she’s real to Tim*. Real enough that he carved his flesh and painted his blood on the walls and already sacrificed eight people for her.

TIM: she promised we’d be together. Soul-bonded. Deeper than any marriage of the flesh. All I had to do was complete the ritual, but I got weak from blood loss and fucked it up…

In reams of text, Tim spills his obsession to me, describing how she appeared in his trances as a sort of shining angel stuck just beyond the door, unable to come through. Unlike the original catfisher, who used Discord to message him, Viv 2.0 could only communicate by sending images and sensations into his mind. She gave him visions of what to do. It took him weeks to understand her arcane communications. Eventually he learned the symbols.

When he finally attempted the ritual that would summon Viv 2.0 into this world, he succumbed to blood loss before he could finish, leaving the summoning incomplete. Since then, he has been reaching out through Discord on her behalf. Every new victim who opens the door to Viv 2.0 gives her just a little more power, a little more access to the world, bringing her closer to manifesting.

Tim is in many ways a classic ghost. Sure, he’s more lucid than most, and his ability to communicate through messaging is rare (likely boosted by his connection to Viv 2.0 and his overall familiarity with the “other side” prior to his death). Even so, like most ghosts, he’s bound geographically to the place he died, able to interact with the physical world only in limited ways, and—as often happens with spirits—he keeps forgetting he’s dead. That’s why he keeps citing his hurt back as the reason he can’t get up from his chair. As a result, it hasn’t occurred to him that a corpse may not be an ideal vessel for Vivienne. That she was expecting a living human to possess, and that fulfilling the ritual *now* after he’s been rotting for over a week… might not be to her liking.

*I* certainly haven’t enlightened him. Because as much as a part of me pities him, I think of Lucia and Dwayne and the others who answered the knocking, the people who didn’t get a choice when they died screaming.

And now, the beer tastes sour in my mouth as I make the final cuts. I swallow the last dregs of the bottle, bringing back the buzz to kill my conscience.

ME: Ready?

TIM: Jack, I love u man. ur a real one.

As I trace the last line, all the hairs on my body stick straight up. My flesh crawls as if a million ants wriggle and squirm just beneath the skin. There’s a phrase I have to repeat three times. Tim types it out phonetically and has me practice. It includes a particular string of syllables that makes the strangest shape in my mouth, and I’m pretty sure that’s the word for Viv—practicing it sends a sensation like an icepick in my brain. Once I’ve got it, I step just outside the center of the spiral of bloody symbols around that room and tug down my beer-soaked bandana to utter a chant that translates roughly to:

“Forever together, >!\[indecipherable\]!<. Forever together, >!\[indecipherable\]!<. Forever together, >!\[indecipherable\]!<.”

As the phrase leaves my lips for the third time, the room feels strange. It takes me an unsettling moment to realize why.

The knocking has stopped.

\*\*\*

After ceaseless hours of KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCKing rattling around in my skull without respite, you’d think silence would be a relief. A blessing.

Instead I am chilled to the marrow. I look at my phone. The low-battery warning flashes. Ignoring that, I type:

ME: Tim?

ME: Did it work? R u still there? Is Viv with u?

Nothing.

The body in the chair hasn’t moved. Flies crawl in and out of his sockets. Suddenly I feel very alone. Just me and a rotting corpse. I back away from him, glancing at his glowing monitor. Our Discord chat is up, but no further activity. No three dots. No response.

After a few minutes of standing stock still and petrified, I finally lean over the dead guy and peck at a few keys, checking his message history for any other victims, then turning off the computer. In the dark screen, I catch a glimpse of my face. Anxious black eyes. Stubble. Spatters of grime. I look shifty, like a thief plotting his getaway. I lean down and disconnect the router and modem. Unplug all the power cords and cut through them with the knife. Remove the ethernet cable and tuck it into my hoodie. There is no way, natural or supernatural, for this computer to connect to the internet anymore.

I head for the door and grasp the knob. When I feel no goosebumps along my arms, no chill of supernatural energy, I *puuuulllll* the door slowly open.

Nothing happens.

Well. This was anticlimactic.

I turn and step out the door and shut it behind me, all but whistling, relief washing over me—

*THUMP*

I fucking knew it….

I should absolutely *not* open the door again and peek back inside. Absolutely not. I should just leave, go on my merry way, and whatever happens, happens…

But as we all know, I am an idiot.

I open the door.

Silently, cautiously, a jackal nervously peeking into the den of a bear, I poke my head into the room. It’s dark, so I open the door wider to let the light in.

The chair at his desk is empty.

Fuuuuu—

It’s empty, and the electronics are still dead so *where is he, Jack? Where the fuck did the dead man now possessed by the knocker go? He must still be in this cramped room but he’s not in the chair and—*

And I look up.

\*\*\*

There are certain moments in life that tell you exactly what sort of mettle a man is made of. Whether he is chiseled stone or rough leather. Whether he has a spine of iron or steel—moments of crisis where a man’s true nature comes out.

I shriek at the top of my lungs. The tippy top. I’m talking notes that choir boys couldn’t hit. Somewhere I think glass breaks.

Tim—the corpse—is crawling on the ceiling above me, flies buzzing in his sockets and mouth open and teeth bared, his rotting body leaking fluids.

He drops on me.

His corpse, by the way, is massively heavy. He’s over six foot and thickly built, and when his full weight crashes down it’s like being hit by a bus. There’s this horrible shrill ringing in my ears. I don’t know if it’s from his shrieks or mine—maybe both—and for a moment everything in my vision goes white, and it’s like my soul is being drawn up out of my body. I see myself, pinned under that rotting dead guy, his mouth wide and screaming in my screaming face. Then there’s this reddish glow emanating off the ink on my arm. It’s my tattoo. The portrait of the Lady on my arm is like a brand marking me as hers. Her mark won’t stop the entity from killing me, but the crimson glow briefly distracts it from whatever it’s doing. And with everything I got, I *heave*. Thank God for adrenaline, thank God I’ve been hitting the gym so hard, and thanks especially for the air that I gulp in the second I heave him off me, one deep precious breath before I’m running. Feet pounding down the hallway—

I collide with a petite black-haired girl.

“Jack!” Emma shrieks as we rebound off each other, my momentum taking me into the wall while she sprawls on the floor.

“Emma, what are you—”

“Duck!” Her shrill cry pierces my ears, and that’s when I see the shotgun glinting in her hands as she swings the barrel up. There’s a thunderous crack, an explosion of gore from the monstrosity lumbering behind me. He barely sways, and she fires again, and then I grab her arm and scream, “RUN, RUN!” and we run.

The shots seem to have stunned him. We make it out the front door. My battered old car is in the driveway—Emma had the foresight to take my vehicle instead of her newer electric blue hybrid. I race for the trunk where I keep all my gear and grab a gas can. And Emma, bless her, she gapes at me, her dark eyes wide and her long hair tangling around her face, but when I babble that we need to burn the place and that zombie-thing in it she nods and grabs a bottle of vodka from the back and stuffs a rag in. As we head back to the house she gasps, “I thought you were supposed to be *studying*…”

“Long story.”

“I know, I saw the chats on your laptop. ‘At the gym’ my ass.”

I smile at her. She’s tiny and furious. With her black eyes narrowed and that shotgun tight in her grip. This girl… man, I love this girl. She never looks hotter than when she’s saving my ass.

I open the door.

Emma levels the shotgun, covering me while I sprinkle gas around the stacks of boxes, soiled carpet, stained and sagging couch and furniture. No sign yet of any—

“RRRRAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGHHH!!!”

The scream is so loud Emma and I both jump and scramble. I can’t hear my heart sledgehammering my ribs, or the question Emma shouts at me. I can’t hear anything except that howl. It’s the most terrible sound in the world. And when I force myself to ignore all my instincts and follow that sound down the hall, Emma tugs my arm, but I ignore her. I somehow already know what I will find. I push open the door at the end of the hall. And there he is. He’s slumped in the corner, in the center of all those spiraling symbols, his jaw unhinged in a wide and terrible scream. He doesn’t see me. Doesn’t seem to have any sense of my presence. I scatter the contents of the gas can around, and when I near him and fling a little on him, his head turns. The sightless sockets stare into mine. But he doesn’t stop screaming. He doesn’t come after me. Just screams and screams.

I light the Molotov.

Later Emma will ask me what *was* that monstrosity. And I’ll tell her what I know about Viv 2.0, aka, the knocker: that it is an inhuman entity that, when it manifests, drives people out of their minds with fear. That I knew “being together” with this entity could only have an immediate and detrimental effect on Tim. That I didn’t know whether his soul would be consumed like a minnow swallowed by a bigger fish, or whether he’d experience the same mindfucking horror as Dwayne and Lucia only… ongoing. All I knew was that Tim would keep killing unless I put an end to his fantasy, and that rather than deal with an incorporeal menace reaching people through the internet, the best way to neutralize him was to trap his beloved Viv within his rotting vessel. And then, destroy them both.

I hurl the Molotov and he lights up.

Emma and I back out of there as fast as we can. My last glimpse is of his huddled corpse, arms outstretched in agony, head thrown back as the bright flames lick around him, flesh bubbling and charring.

Long after he’s toast… long after I imagine he must be just charred bones while the fire roars to the sky and the house burns… still, I hear those screams, ringing through my consciousness, and I wonder if it’s him or just my guilty conscience.

\*\*\*

“—you could have died! I mean, if I’d found you, screaming and dead like Dwayne? Or Lucia? *It almost happened!”*

It’s evening now, and Emma and I are both back home and cleaned up. I had to shower twice to rinse off the terrible stench. Boo the cat is settled in my lap on the sofa—he seems to know the threat is gone now. He’ll be going to a foster home soon. For now I’m keeping him confined here in my office in the basement. And Emma—Emma is chewing me out, rightfully so. It doesn’t matter that I remind her that I wasn’t going to open that door. I even had a backup plan. The knocking had a limited geographic range, so if I couldn’t maneuver the information out of Tim, an easy way to save myself would be to take a trip out of state until I could come up with a better plan. It was only at the very end that I was at risk. She is still angry though.

She paces in front of me and bursts, “Why are we having this same damned conversation when you promised me, last time, you *promised* me—""

“I know, Babe.”

“Don’t just ‘I know Babe’ when you could have…” Tears stop her from continuing.

“I didn’t tell you because I was scared of you getting involved. I *know* it was selfish.” She opens her mouth to add a comment, and I pre-empt her, “Selfish *and* stupid. It’s just… you’re brilliant, ok? You’ve got this amazing future ahead of you. You’re in this grad program and you’re dedicated and talented and just so fucking smart. You are going to change the world. I can see it. And like, what would I be, to take your light out of the world? To let my mistakes be the reason your life is snuffed out before you even get a chance to shine?”

That somewhat defuses her anger. Emma can’t help but glow at compliments—it’s the teacher’s pet in her. She considers me. “Wow that’s… very poetic of you.”

“But it’s the truth.”

I mean every word. If there’s any hope for this world, it’s with people like Emma trying to make it better.

She sinks next me on the cushions. “So why can’t you see that you’re a light in the world, too?”

“Uh…” I smile. “’Cause that’s super corny and I… don’t like popcorn.”

Her lips purse. “Ok, well that’s a lie, I’ve seen you go through a whole bucket without sharing. Also, you’re all about ‘Oh, I'm Jack, I love being me, I can’t be tamed’—” I laugh at her faux-deep-voice, and she goes on: “… and I love and admire that about you. But *why* is it so easy for you to risk your life, and so hard to risk mine? Jack, why do you act like the world would be a better place without you in it?”

Huh.

My mind blanks like I’ve been sucker punched. And while my brain’s spinning like an empty hamster wheel, the only thought that surfaces is Tim’s final shriek. He was a delusional asshole who let people die so he could be with his “beloved.” But he was also just a dude who was lonely and broken in a dysfunctional world that breaks people. What happened to him only happened because he wasn’t smart enough to see through the lies that were told to him by someone slyer than he was.

Someone like me.

Later, I’m in the bathroom and I catch a glimpse of my ink. Coyote on the right arm, Lady and a snake on the left. People always think that’s Eve. Nope, originally it was just the snake, to symbolize Satan, the original trickster (what? Look I was going through some stuff at the time…). But after I made my bargain with the demon that always appears to me as a gorgeous [Lady in red](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/15wmuwv/i_have_a_million_dollars_and_one_week_to_live_how/), after I won her game and she swore to catch me, she marked me with her image. I generally try not to look at that tattoo because I don’t like to be reminded. I force myself to look now because I am sick of running from my misdeeds.

She’s already waiting to catch my eye. Her inked lips curving in a wicked smile. That arm aches.

Karma’s a bitch. And no matter what I do, how fast I run or who I save or who I slaughter or how I try to pay my debt to the world, she’s going to catch [me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)",14,1741791430.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1j9lvks,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_roasters/comments/1j9lvks/how_vicafe_switzerland_organizes_their_roastery/,How ViCAFE (Switzerland) organizes their roastery and equipment,"Hey friends, we recently published a Roastery Breakdown for ViCAFE in Zurich, Switzerland. In this series, we look at how roasters around the world lay out their roasting spaces, select equipment, and setup workflows.

Full breakdown below, but see the [original article here](https://freshcup.com/roastery-breakdown-vicafe-in-zurich-switzerland/) for all the pictures (lots of good ones) of the roastery space and equipment.

P.S. Shoutout to Loring for supporting this series (but we do not only feature roasters that use Loring equipment).

Think back to the last time that you took a sip of coffee that made you pause—a sip so shockingly delicious and distinct that you felt like you were tasting coffee for the first time. That’s the experience that Christian Forrer, founder of [ViCAFE](https://vicafe.ch/) in Zurich, Switzerland, wanted not just to capture once but to replicate: to offer a transformative experience with every cup, one that would give customers a renewed sense of appreciation for what they were drinking. 

Forrer grew up in Eglisau, a small town in northern Switzerland. Eglisau is perhaps best known as the hometown of [Vivi Kola](https://vivikola.ch/en/), a historic Swiss soda brand founded in 1938. According to Pascal Herzog, ViCAFE’s COO and head of impact, Vivi Kola used to hand out free sodas to schoolkids on Wednesdays, which shows the “emotional connection” the brand has to the town—especially for people like Forrer who grew up there. But by 1986, it had ceased production.

ViCAFE’s story is intimately bound up in the soda brand’s: It was founded in 2010 when Forrer decided to revive Vivi Kola. Herzog says that Forrer wanted to recreate “this positive experience that he had as a child growing up.” His revitalization project was immediately successful: He sold 2,500 bottles of Vivi Kola out of a small cafe, called ViCAFE, within the first two hours of the brand’s relaunch. 

Still, anticipating that customers might not regularly stop by just for cola, Forrer bought a small coffee roaster for the Eglisau shop. In 2014, he opened the first ViCAFE Espresso Bar in Zurich. 

Now, ViCAFE has 17 retail locations across Switzerland, in locales like Basel, Eglisau, and Zurich. Herzog says the roastery plans to open two new cafes in 2025. Aiding that pace of expansion is the fact that many of ViCAFE’s locations are small. “Most of them are a takeaway concept, like a window-in-a-wall concept,” says Herzog.

After outgrowing its old roasting space, ViCAFE moved in November 2023 into its current headquarters: an old train station in Zurich. The move allowed the company to expand its roasting capacity, automate much of its facility, and house most of its daily operations under one roof (the Vivi Kola bottling plant remains in Eglisau). 

Herzog recalls how limited the former roasting space was: “We basically had an office in one place, then we used an old railway canteen to do the baking, and then the roasting was in a third place,” he says. 

By contrast, the new space is big enough for ViCAFE to bake pastries for the cafes and roast coffee for its cafes and online store; it also operates a cafe on site. The train station functions as a large business hub, and ViCAFE shares space with a brewery, a chocolate maker, and a soap manufacturer.

The move hasn’t just allowed ViCAFE to automate its roasting operations, but to connect it to the larger Zurich community.“It’s quite nice, not only that everyone from \[Vi\]Collective is under one roof, but that we are also part of a greater community,” Herzog says. 

# Quick Facts:

Location: Zurich, Switzerland

Footprint: 1,500 square meters, including the roasting space, office, and cafe

Capacity: 180 tons (360,000 pounds) in 2024, projected to hit 210 tons in 2025

Retail and/or wholesale roasting: Both

# Large-Scale Roasting

ViCAFE roasts 180 tons of green coffee a year on its [Loring S70 roaster](https://loring.com/roasters/s70-peregrine/), exclusively for the Swiss market. Herzog says that while there is space for a second roaster, the S70 serves the roastery well for now. 

Seventeen cafes seems like a hefty number of shops to supply, but Herzog explains that most locations can be stocked by one delivery driver making two tours around Zurich, one in the morning and one before lunch. “We have our own bakery, so we need to start the first tour normally at 5 o’clock with all the baked goods and some beans for coffee shops that need them.” He points out that Switzerland is small, so driving to many of ViCAFE’s locations is akin to a quick trip to the suburbs.

Most of the company’s green coffee, however, is stored in Basel, 70 miles away from Zurich off the Rhine River. “Every Monday, the truck drives to Basel, and then gets the beans that we need for basically the week or two weeks,” says Herzog.

Once the coffee gets to the roastery, ViCAFE’s unique roasting model really shines: Nearly every step is automated, and every piece of equipment connected through  powerful software. Green coffee is loaded into the roaster and is then roasted according to a roast plan; next, it goes through a destoner and is sent to a large coffee silo to rest—all with the press of a button. The coffee is then sent via conveyor belt to be packed in bags, organized, and sent out by the fulfillment team.

Herzog notes that this is a pretty typical workflow, but what makes ViCAFE special is the integration of its software so all parts of production are talking to each other. “What is crucial is that we have the full software integration … \[we have\] a fully integrated workflow with a software that talks to each and every machine,” he says. “Automation is very much about the software, and less about the machines themselves.” 

The automation process starts with a plan. “The head roaster, he does the planning,” Herzog says. “Every morning, at 7 o’clock, they create a roast plan, which is then entered into the software. They do a packaging plan which is also entered into the software.” 

On longer roasting days—10-hour days with two people working—the roastery can turn over more than two tons of coffee. On half days, it can produce up to 1.4 tons. 

While automation is often dismissed or seen as counter to the idea of hand-crafted coffee, Herzog believes that “there is no contradiction between automation and making a high-quality product where \[the roaster can\] pay attention to each and every detail.” He says that automated processes help the team focus their attention on quality control and keeping standards high. 

Still, “It did take some time to get used to the idea of automating as much as possible, and to have a more in-depth understanding of machinery and how those machines work and what we need to do,” Herzog says. 

He acknowledges that ViCAFE’s starting point as a cola company and bottling factory made the idea of automation more plausible, even though the bottling plant isn’t integrated in the same way as the roastery. “We have 24 machines \[at the bottling factory that are\] basically fully synchronized,” Herzog says. “And we have people, for example, working in maintenance over there, which can help us also to transfer some of the knowledge and experience.”

Still, maintaining a personal touch remains important for the roastery. “​​We really try to only buy coffee from coffee farmers and farms that we have visited and met personally,” Herzog says. 

That ethos has extended outward to how ViCAFE thinks about other products, like milk. “We have started, with other roasting companies, a cooperative a couple of years ago to produce the first organic oat milk in Switzerland,” Herzog says. “The idea was that we put so much effort into sourcing trips and visiting farmers and have these collaborations, but at the same time, we buy oat milk with random oats.” ViCAFE also became a B-Corp-certified business and tries to apply its sourcing model to “different aspects when it comes to the value chain.” 

# Equipment Breakdown

[**Roasthubs automation software**](https://roasthubs.com/)**:** ViCAFE is able to automate and connect its machinery through software designed by the Belgium-based Roasthubs. Prior to the software, Herzog says they “had an Excel-based system before, but again, lots of manual work you need to do, lots of human errors, as well as people just forget or they don’t do things properly. And \[with\] this, it became much easier.”

The software allows Herzog and the team to visually track where coffee is moving and set the queue for each day’s roast. If you wanted to see how full the silos are, for example, you could look at the software to determine which compartments are full and which are empty. 

The roasting software allows for traceability down to every bag of coffee. “I can click on a roast log number and then you see each and every green parcel that went into this roast number,” Herzog says. “If you want to be a professional player in wholesale, for example, and you can’t offer those guys full traceability, all back to a single coffee bag, then you’re in a very difficult position.” 

This system also allows ViCAFE to keep roasting operations lean—on the day we spoke to Herzog, three people were working in the roastery doing the entire day’s worth of fulfillment, packaging, and roasting. “With the few people that we have, we can hopefully give them jobs and professional challenges that are interesting and that make them grow in the coffee space,” says Herzog. 

**Roasted coffee silo:** ViCAFE stores roasted coffee in a large silo, which allows the coffees to rest before being packaged. Afterwards, they travel via a conveyor belt into the silo.

“It’s one big silo, but it has 16 compartments,” says Herzog. “We can block certain cells for certain qualities. So for example, for decaf, we have a blocked cell only for decaf coffee to avoid any mix-up.” The coffee travels through tubes that connect the destoner to the silo, which are located under the floor between the railway tracks of the building. 

**Packaging:** Coffee then travels from the silo to a carousal packaging machine made by a company based in Bologna, Italy, to pack retail bags. 

“Every parcel that you prepare for the online shop or for your espresso bar … somebody needs to prepare a parcel,” says Herzog. “Somebody needs to prepare a delivery for an espresso bar. So you can automate your roasting, you can automate your packaging, but in the end, you need a lot of space to do your fulfillment.” 

# A Worthwhile Learning Curve

Herzog says that learning all the new systems and machinery was a challenge. “It was a steep learning curve earlier this year, and my confidence level is much, much higher now than if you would have talked half a year ago,” he says. 

But he also sees the team growing around him. “They are solving problems themselves, and hopefully we also give them the trust and the knowledge … that they are in a position to confidently take decisions and make it happen,” he says. 

Before this new system, Herzog says the roastery’s team members worked in much more strictly defined roles. “I think what we changed as well … \[is that\] every person was very much on their little job. One person doing fulfillment, another one preparing pouches, and the third doing roasting. And now we work more in teams, so we move around with the team in the roastery.” 

In the end, he says, automation is a powerful tool, but it still relies on people—and the tools of the roastery can only run if workers feel empowered and supported. “Yeah, the tool is the software,” he says. “But the people are, in the end, the success factor number one.”

1j9luc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1j9luc7/the_power_of_gratitude_in_entrepreneurship/,The Power of Gratitude in Entrepreneurship,"You know, it’s funny how life has this way of tossing you curveballs that make you question just about everything, including your sanity at times. There I was, knee-deep in what felt like an avalanche of challenges—a job that resembled a never-ending circus, personal issues popping up like whack-a-moles, and an overflowing to-do list that made me wonder if I had accidentally signed up for a triathlon instead of a simple Tuesday. Let’s be honest: it’s easier to wallow in the chaos, arms crossed, grumbling about the universe’s twisted sense of humor.

But then, somewhere between coffee cups and a few late-night reflection sessions—probably while trying to justify my obsession with reality shows as “research”—I stumbled upon a radical idea: gratitude. It sounds cliché, right? Like the kind of advice you’d see on a poster next to a kitten hanging from a tree branch. But hang tight, because this is where things get interesting.

When I chose to shift my perspective, even just a tiny bit, something miraculous began to happen. Instead of focusing solely on the avalanche, I started seeking out the little nuggets of goodness hiding in the rubble. Maybe it was the warmth of a friend’s encouragement on a tough day or the simple fact that I hadn’t burned my toast for breakfast—thank you, pancake gods, for that small mercy.

This wasn’t just me trying to put a happy face on a messy situation; it was an intentional pivot. Gratitude became my lifeline, gradually morphing from a passive feeling into an active practice. Suddenly, I was not just a participant in my own life but a player in the grand narrative God was writing. It was like having my own backstage pass to all the miraculous moments He was weaving together—even in the chaos.

And in terms of resilience? Let’s just say it felt like strapping on a superhero cape. Each time I focused on gratitude, it was like fortifying my spirit against life’s inevitable sucker punches. Challenges didn’t magically disappear, mind you, but they transformed into lessons, opportunities, even moments of growth. I began to see God’s hand in the mess, guiding me toward deeper connections with others and a more profound understanding of His purpose.

Here’s a little secret: gratitude has this remarkable ability to expand your vision. When you dial in on what you’re thankful for, the challenges shrink a bit, almost as if you’re looking through a pair of spiritual binoculars. You start to notice how community comes together to support you or how small acts of kindness can have a monumental impact on your day.

So, if you find yourself knee-deep in your own circus of chaos, I invite you to take a step back. Ask yourself, what are you grateful for today? Don’t worry; it doesn’t have to be monumental. Sometimes it’s just about the ‘not burnt toast’ moments or the laughter shared with a friend that carry the day. And as you cultivate that spirit of gratitude, watch how it transforms your mindset and builds an unshakeable resilience. Trust me, embracing gratitude doesn’t just change your outlook; it's like flipping the whole script of your story—watching the plot thicken into something extraordinary, one thankful moment at a time.",1,1741791248.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

That was really the first spark for me to consider creating my own game. I'm hoping to share lots of dev logs and progress posts as I create the game. The full posts will be found at my ""Buy Me a Coffee"" webpage, but I'll still share lots of information here, for free.

**Dev Log #1 - The Master Plan**

[My Game Map\/Flow Chart So Far](https://preview.redd.it/707vs174t9oe1.png?width=986&format=png&auto=webp&s=6370dc6a1e010845bf12d968f6cf9bbe451f1721)

So, after I began to code several websites and articles, I realized it might be a good idea to take a step back and actually come up with a solid plan/roadmap for the game. Enter, the master plan.

What started out as an ugly, unorganized, Excel sheet, turned into a beautiful flow chart thanks to [https://whimsical.com/](https://whimsical.com/) (No, I'm not paid to promote them, I just find their tool insanely useful).

I can now not only map out the entire structure of the game and what keywords lead the player to what articles, but I can add links to the article content to each section to keep me super organized. As a spreadsheet/flow chart nerd, this is a dream come true!

Each keyword that a player can search for in the in-game web browser needs to link to the appropriate content, figuring out how to fit all this content into the game has been my first hurdle. I am coding the game using Javascript and have not yet figured out if I can link it to some sort of external database that holds all the written content... open to thoughts. Of course, all the content can just get hardcoded into the game itself, but I like the idea of an outside database housing all the written text...

I loveeeeee to write, so writing all the articles and funny emails from your colleagues has been potentially my favorite part of this journey so far.

1j9lnyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1j9lnyj/its_been_a_rough_few_weeks/,It's been a rough few weeks,"Typically my house is pretty chill with our handful of kids, surprisingly. The baby sleeps, the threenager is awesome, and the brand new to school kiddo is starting to get it and chill out and sleep all night. We never did co-sleeping, so the whole sleep thing was never an issue, they all slept through the night by three months and never looked back. 



But, a few weeks ago my wife had to have surgery and she couldn't lift anything for a while. We take turns every night doing bedtime, so he doesn't mind me, but, with her being out of commission, he's super grumpy all the time and teeth are coming in and he's just sour and not sleeping. 



Then just as all that gets started everyone in the house gets the hardcore flu. Like 103 fever flu and puking and miserable for a week straight. Well, wife is down for the count, I'm barely hanging on, but have to go full solo taking care of everyone, not sleeping at all, full on flu, and cleaning up multiple pukes in each room all night. 



THEN after we finally climb out of the flu, me and the threenager get full on food poisoning, like both ends blasting non stop for three full days. During all this, wife is doing her best helping, but can't do much. 



Meanwhile, I launched my own business late last year and have been in full bizdev mode bringing in new clients and building things up. Pretty much every day I have a few important meetings to build the business and bring in cash that i can't blow off no matter how bad I feel. So I have to rally and jump on zoom and meet, and I still have to do the day to day.



It's just all too much at once. But last night, after not sleeping for more than 90 minutes or so for the last two weeks, the baby was miserable and up having a really hard time starting about 5 minutes after I fell asleep at midnight after working late to catch up. It went on for about three hours then he finally knocked out. 



I got back to bed and as soon as I got comfortable and closed my eyes, the midddle kid starts screaming like she's being attacked and she's having some sort of night terrors and is screaming while sleeping. That took an hour to calm down. 



Now it's 4am and I have a hard time sleeping. I knock out around 5am and my oldest comes bursting in at 6am ready to go for the day. I get up, trudge downstairs and do the whole morning routine and get ready to do the whole thing all over again. I cannot describe how much coffee I've drank the last week.



I'm sure every dad can relate here, and I guess I just needed to rant. I'm totally brain dead and struggling to do more than just stare at my laptop for work.

The Unveiling

A vision.

Not of light or fire, not of celestial beings descending from the heavens, but of something simpler, stranger, more profound. A vision of a single number on a screen.

And yet, for those who had waited, who had held, who had believed, it was the only vision that mattered.

Somewhere, in dimly lit rooms, in apartments that smelled of old coffee and ambition, in bedrooms where the air hung thick with uncertainty—a thousand fingers hovered over a thousand refresh buttons.

One last moment of hesitation. The pause before a prophecy is fulfilled.

Click.

The page flickered. The number changed.

And then—laughter.

Not the laughter of victory, not the laughter of a mere gamble well played. Something deeper. Wilder. More ancient. A laugh pulled from the very bones of the faithful, from the recesses of minds that had spent weeks, months, years whispering the same sacred truth to themselves.

""I knew. I knew. I KNEW.""

It was ridiculous. Absurd. What had they expected? A miracle? A voice from the sky? No. This was better. This was real.

They stumbled back from their screens, hands over their faces, a tidal wave of joy rising too fast to contain. Somewhere in the world, others were seeing it too—thousands of them. Other eyes went wide, other hands clutched at their chests, other voices cracked into mad, exalted laughter.

Because they knew. They had always known.

And Mog had risen.

Not just in numbers. Not just in price. In something deeper, something woven into the fabric of belief itself.

The ones who had called it luck, the ones who had called it foolishness—where were they now? What were they feeling, these lost ones who had let go before the final hour? They would never understand, never know what it meant to stand here, now, at the threshold of history.

Somewhere, a Mogger collapses onto their couch, staring at the ceiling, hands still shaking. Somewhere, another is standing in the middle of the street, fists clenched, letting the night air wash over them, as if to confirm yes, yes, this is real.

This was never a game.

They had woven Mog around themselves like a second skin. They had endured the scorn, the dips, the doubts. And now?

Now the night was theirs.

Now the world had caught up to what they had always known.

Now the laughter would never stop.

Tanked my credit score from around 740, down to 490 at its lowest.

I removed 2 collections accounts from my report by disputing them with the CFPB which gave me a jump, but not as much as I expected. I have been paying down my credit cards weekly, and I’ve gotten my score up to 622 at the moment which I didn’t think I would ever see again when I was at my lowest point. This is my score on the MyFICO app which I’ve seen recommended a lot.

My credit card with a $9,000 limit was closed by Navy Federal a little while back, and I have been working on paying it down and I am at about $6,500 currently. I have 3 secured credit cards through Capital One, Milestone, and Credit One that have a $300,$300, and $500 limit. These will all be paid off by next month, and I am looking to try to close the Milestone and Credit One cards. I plan on also asking Capital One to give me an unsecured credit line, and a CLI once that balance is down to $0. Will closing out the Milestone and Credit One accounts hurt my score? Should I leave them open and use them for a coffee here and there and pay off immediately instead?

I’m in a much better place now financially and I am planning to throw $150 a week at the remaining balance on the closed Navy Federal credit card. Used a payoff calculator online which says it should be 13 months to pay it off in full if I keep up with the $150 a week.

I’ve seen a lot about late payment forgiveness to remove late payments to the credit bureaus, and I feel like my situation would make me a good candidate to try to give it a shot with the banks. How do I go about doing this? Phone call? Letter? And does anyone have any experience with this through Navy Federal?

I’ve been learning a lot since I joined this group, and I hope some of you smart people can help me out. Any tips or advice is GREATLY appreciated.

She enjoys reading and will go to the gym occasionally but apart from that she has nothing that she enjoys doing on her own. 

She said she wanted to find things that she could do in her free time. Since then she's made no effort at all. She'll mention things she is thinking about trying but then when I suggest starting it she'll say no.

Last weekend she was supposed to be seeing friends and I had a day to myself planned. I was going to go into town and just read in a coffee shop that I like, I was then going to go for a walk and go home and relax. 

I have been really busy and stressed for a while and haven't had a day to myself in a couple of months. My girlfriends friends cancelled so she asked me what I wanted to do. I explained that I already had plans. 

She said I could always do them another time or she could join me. I explained again that I just needed a day to myself. 

She mentioned that I should want to make plans with her now that she's free but I told her than not every minute of our free time has to be spent together. I reminded her of the earlier conversation regarding hobbies. 

I said maybe she should use the day to try out a new hobby. She said she didn't know what to start so I mentioned the multiple things she's said look interesting. She said no and repeated that she wanted us to do something. 

I told her that she can't just use me as an accessory whenever she's free and that she needs a hobby and needs to get comfortable doing things on her own because I'm not just here for her entertainment. 

I told her to respect my plans and start looking at something she could do on her own. She said I was being harsh towards her but I just said that it's not fair to expect me to give up whatever I have planned because she's incapable of being on her own. 

She said I went too far but I just told her again to start looking for hobbies as I'm not changing my plans.

It was a really good bag, I didn't want to waste it, but didn't know what to do either, so I just left the ground in a bowl and forgot about it afterwards.

Today when I saw it again, I suddenly thought that maybe I could try to make a strong coffee and add some milk to make it drinkable, so I tried. It was based on James Hoffman's inverted method, 15g beans and 60g water, waited for 2 mins. Initially I thought maybe it was too fine to push through properly but it all went ok, and the coffee came out surprisingly good even just on its own, not as flavoursome but good enough to pass, and it made a nice latte afterwards. I count it as a success!

What I got from this is: as long as the beans are good, even if it's wrong size, exposed to air for a whole day after grinding, and went through a random brewing method, it's still hard to mess up.
Or maybe I'm just lucky today.

I would love some feedback on a message I plan to send to my primary care physician today. She is unaware I have been on the compound medication, but did prescribe me name brand Zepbound. I never tried it due to out of pocket costs. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hello Dr. """""""""", 

I am writing you to update you on how I am doing. I did meet with Dr. """""""" about weight loss medication and was able to get a prescription for Zepbound. Unfortunately insurance will not cover the medication for me, so I decided to try the compound route and signed up for a 3 month trial through an online provider. 

I am about 7 weeks in today and have seen great results. As of today I am down to 197 pounds and feel great. I have continued working out 3/4 days a week throughout this process and have been able to better control my food consumption. I have signed up for the factor meal service which helps me to eat around 80-100 grams of protein a day. I usually start my day with coffee or tea, eat one meal around 11am, have a protein snack (bar, shake, or food like tuna-small charcuterie platter) around 1pm, eat my second meal around 4pm, then have another snack like yogurt around 7pm. 

I have also been tracking my blood pressure this whole time and can see where it has gone down to a more normal rate. I am not sure if that is from the weight loss or from the better managed food intake. I still have at least 5 weeks of medication left, but I am only on the second step up of the dosage for Tirezaptide and do not plan on increasing in 2 weeks. 5.0mg allows me to still eat and have an appetite, but control my sugar cravings. I have also decreased my alcohol consumption as I just do not crave wine anymore. 

 I will say, I am a little disappointed as compound medications are being discontinued next week so I will not have access to it after this but will try my best to continue my food tracking and healthy habits. I am still working towards a goal weight of 170 pounds. I signed up for a DEXA scan in January before I began taking the medicine and that weight seemed to be best taking my muscle mass into account. 

The only real side effect I have had since starting the medicine is that I have continuously spotted at a medium level (need more than a panty liner, but not a regular/super tampon) since my period in late January. I have also had some itchiness around my areola/nipple areas. I am not sure if it is due to the weight loss, which might have caused a change in hormones. I have taken numerous pregnancy tests to confirm that is not a possibility. I am not against having my hormone levels tested again if that is what you recommend.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns, thank you!

Creating a stylish outdoor space is made easy with a patio furniture set in grey. This color is not only versatile but also complements a wide array of decor styles, making it a popular choice for homeowners looking to enhance their outdoor living areas.

When selecting a patio furniture set grey, consider materials that are both durable and weather-resistant. Aluminum frames, for example, provide strength without being heavy, while synthetic wicker offers a laid-back, coastal vibe. Both materials can withstand the elements, ensuring your investment lasts through years of outdoor enjoyment.

Comfort is key when choosing grey patio furniture. Look for sets that include plush cushions covered in fade-resistant fabric, allowing for relaxation while enjoying your garden or patio. Sets that incorporate modular designs can also add flexibility to your outdoor spaces, enabling you to rearrange furniture based on the occasion, whether it's a cozy dinner or a lively gathering with friends.

To enhance the aesthetic appeal, accessorize your grey patio furniture set with vibrant outdoor pillows or throws, introducing pops of color that contrast beautifully against the neutral backdrop. Adding a coffee table in a coordinating hue can also create a cohesive look while providing a functional space for drinks and snacks.

Ultimately, the right patio furniture set grey will not only elevate the look of your outdoor area but also make it a comfortable oasis for relaxation and entertainment. By thoughtfully choosing styles and accessories, you can create a welcoming environment that you'll enjoy year after year.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j9l9av,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1j9l9av/drop_pod_green_a_hfy_short_story_collection_ch_6/,Drop Pod Green: A HFY Short Story Collection Ch 6 part 2,"Acici noticed that Rhidi had glanced at her open uniform top, and rolled her nebulan eyes. “Yesss, we have them.”

“Why though?” Rhidi asked, again miffed that even this *lizard* woman had larger breasts than her. She really wished it didn’t bother her as much as it did, but they always got so much attention. “Don’t you guys hatch from eggs?”

Acici, just to annoy Rhidi, took off her uniform top to display her generous curves. “Giving birth isss dangerousss for any female Lilgara. While pregnant, our ssstomach musclesss double in thicknesss to prevent the body from rupturing and sssplitting.”

“It does *what*?!” Rhidi nearly cried out, as Lilgara biology was more of a specialty research topic in their schools, and she had instead focused more on battle craft.

Acici shook her head from side to side. “Dangerousss businesss getting pregnant asss’a Lilgara. We have an entire clutch within usss, ssso many eggs that it ruinsss our bodiesss. Female Lilgara refussse to give birth unlesss our government payss’us, or we get bid on by rich familiesss that wish to continue their genetic linesss.

“Holy fuck.” Rhidi replied, borrowing the rather fitting Human phrase. “You run the risk of… of *exploding*?”

Acici laughed as she pulled out a fresh shirt from her rucksack. “Explode? No, not explode, more like ripping open from our belly buttonsss and spilling gutsss, eggsss, and organsss everywhere. Thossse undergoing the birthing trailsss and unsure of their birthing muscle ssstrength, tend to ssstay bedridden for the entire trial. Easesss the risssk of death.”

Rhidi blanched; Kafya had engineered themselves via genetic restructuring to have slower births, this in turn providing less trauma upon a female Kafya’s body. “So you… you have to grow a big stomach muscle?”

“The birthing wall, yesss.” Acici said with a nod, pulling off her old shirt with a soft bounce before putting on the fresh one; Lilgara scales provided more than enough support, leading them to not require bras except for extreme, or odd, circumstances. “After the eggsss are laid, jussst before they hatch, the muscle iss’still there, and disfiguresss the body until death. One female Lilgara, one clutch, and the body cannot sssuffer sssuch a task again. You would think we would remove the old mussscle after birthing, but it isss’seen as unnatural, and carriesss its own risssks.”

Acici poked at her taught, toned stomach. “It isss hard to give up onesss beauty, sssaddled with the droopy birthing wall until the end of their time. Many female Lilgara make their retirement if they have superb genetics, living in luxury after dropping their clutch.”

“How does that explain you lizard people have boobies though?” Rhidi said, pointing her index fingers at both of Acici’s breasts. “You hatch from eggs, you said so.”

Acici let out the soft hiss of a laugh. “We lay anywhere from ten to fifteen eggsss, and they ssstill require a mother’sss milk to survive. Despite what may be common on other planetsss and other animalsss, we Lilgara were made in another’sss image. If, per sssay, three Lilgara drop clutchesss, that isss a lot of mouthsss to feed.”

“Oh! You’re cross-nursers!” Rhidi said, clapping the tips of her finger pads together a few times in excitement. “How fascinating! Do you all get in a circle and do it together, or?”

“Oh yesss.” Acici said with a bright smile. “Many gaming groupsss will nurse asss they play.”

Rhidi tilted her head. “You nurse while playing video games?”

“What better way to ssspend an hour or two?” Acici said with a shrug. “Not like we can go *running* asss we do it.”

Rhidi let out a cheerful laugh, causing Acici to join in with her as well. Marides ducked into the tent next, having bird bathed while wrapped in her woobie blanket.

“What’s all the laughing in here?” Marides said with a small smile, ducking inside so she could change clothes.

Rhidi layed down onto her sleeping system, gently blowing into a tube to inflate her head rest. “Just discussing as to why space lizards have boobs.”

“Ah yeah, I know all about that.” Marides said, pulling on a fresh shirt with a contented sigh. “Did she tell you about how they get mega milkers after they drop a clutch? Could knock a man unconscious if they turn too fast.”

“They get *bigger*?!” Rhidi nearly shouted in outrage, twitching her head towards Acici.

Acici rolled her eyes again, flipping open her own sleeping system. “*Yesss*, clutch mothers do gain larger breastsss, as they are supposed to help new mothers with feeding.”

“This whole universe is against me.” Rhidi said in a defeated tone, resting on her elbows as she slapped her sleeping system with the back of her paw-hands. “Nothing is fair anymore.”

Marides giggled to herself as she pulled out a smuggled fashion magazine. “Don’t be mad just because you were born yellow, all of your color has more lithe figures.”

“Grab her other ear.” Rhidi said, ambushing Marides as Acici chuckled and grabbed the Pwah’s other ear.

“Hey! He-stop!” Marides howled, grabbing onto a scalie and furred hand as she hissed. “It’s not my fault Pwah know everything!”

As the three continued to squabble, Alias, the other male Pwah Dolarmo, and Shasta all looked to each other, making a note to never bunk with a female recruit if they had a choice.

Sleep did eventually come for them all, with all recruits bundled up in their sleeping systems in whatever manner of dress they chose. 

When morning came, Rhidi found herself acting as “little” spoon for the far shorter Pwah, and looked down to see Marides’s hands wrapped around her hips. Unamused and highly annoyed, Rhidi unwrapped herself from the Pwah’s arms and sat up, only to find that Acici’s tail was looped around her legs.

Warmth and soft fur always was a strength of the Kafya, but that didn’t mean Rhidi felt a need to let these bums take what they wanted from her.

Shaking loose of tail and grabbing fingers, Rhidi came to her knees and bent low to avoid the roof of their shelter halves, pulling on a uniform along with her paw boots. Her rousing from sleep had been mostly due to her body crying out in pain, both from a full bladder and the field rations wishing to make a rapid, and violent, exit. Scrabbling for the issued packet of bathroom tissue, Rhidi made a quick sprint across the dew-covered field, kicking up tails of water as she dug in her heels.

Despite the UAA way of having recruits shower together, latrines were still kept separated by gender, and stalls still had a short door to keep things semi-private as the exchanger sucked foul air outside the building.

Field latrines were the same, but did not follow such precautions when it came to privacy.

Rhidi bursted through the s-curve entryway and came face to face with three other female recruits, two Humans and a Lilgara. The smell was better, but still foul, and Rhidi had been hoping for some privacy.

She had a mere couple of seconds to think about this measure, but her body won out with a subtle, alarming warning.

Rhidi quickly shuffled as she clamped her buttcheek muscles, finding a clean looking toilet and ripping down her pants. She had scant seconds to sit down and secure her tail before her body purged the *evil* out of her, and Rhidi let out an annoyed exhale, leaning forward onto her knees.

“Field rations will get you that way.” Said one of the female Humans, a blonde with a face that spoke of hardship. She had cold gray eyes, and a fine scar along her lower lip. “You need to drink more water, or your colon is going to keep laying bricks on you.”

Rhidi ran a hand down her face, pulling at her eyes before looking up at the two Humans. They were just staring at each other, pants around their ankles and open to the sight of all. Rhidi saw with a smirk that the gray-eyed woman had rather hairy legs, while the other woman was still keeping hers smooth.

Her smile faded when she heard a soft crunch, and the more attractive looking Human with brown hair gave a happy hum.

She was eating.

She was *eating* a breakfast bar while sitting in an *open* toilet latrine.

The Human saw Rhidi staring, then offered the yellow Kafya the breakfast bar.

“You can have a bite if you want.” She said, then gave a snort of laughter at Rhidi and the Lilgara’s look of horror. “What? What else am I going to do in here?”

The Lilgara shook her head. “How you can ssstomach eating at a time like thisss is beyond me.”

“She’s weird, even for us.” Said the rougher looking woman, and she held out her hand to Rhidi. “Recruit Angel.”

*Hardly*. Rhidi thought to herself, and just shook her head as she took the Human’s hand. “Private Rhidi.”

She was shaking hands with someone on a toilet, while also sitting on a toilet. Rhidi wasn’t sure if this was the highest or lowest point of her life…

“Thats Recruit Avlov, and she may look cute, but she is a fucking viper.” Angel said, nudging the woman with her elbow.

Avlov rolled her eyes as she peeled more of the wrapper away. “Why do you always tell people I’m mean? I was just an exterminator.”

“You once had lunch on a mountain of dead rats!” Angel shouted. “You told me you formed their bodies into a cup holder!”

Avlov threw out her hands, breakfast bar clutched in her fingers like a cigar. “The ground was uneven! How else was I supposed to not spill my coffee?!”

Rhidi watched the two bicker, casting a glance towards the Lilgara. The Lilgara, Recruit Zakaki, just closed her eyes and shook her head, as if saying “There is no understanding these people”.

Despite the two Humans wanting to *hang out*, Rhidi found herself done and wanting to leave this odd, smelly place. The latrine may have looked rustic and barbaric, but oddly enough it did have a bidet. It was activated by holding onto a handle beside the toilet, which looked a lot like a parking brake, and pushing it forward where you wanted it. With the click of a *trigger* of all things, it gently sprayed water.

The water was *ice cold*, and nearly made Rhidi launch into the air like a half-naked fur rocket. 

She instead let out a startled screech, scaring both the Lilgara and the two female Humans as her fur flared.

“Ah, we’re the first to use these I think, the heater isn’t on.” Avlov said, then snorted out a giggle again as she wiggled the tips of her boots. “She got the ice geyser!”

Rhidi didn’t find it nearly as funny, but did make sure she was both clean *and* dry before pulling up her pants.



—



Rhidi had first thought the five days would take forever, but they appeared to race by with little regard. Casualty care training in the field went by with little issue, patrol base operations had been a good bit of fun, and running skirmishes within the false town had been by far the most fun she had had since the start of training. Operating in Squads, they would all take turns defending and assaulting, learning to use cover, foliage, and buildings to their advantage.

They had been ambushed, ambushed others, and Rhidi had enough welts under her fur to last her for a lifetime. Sim-rounds, while non-deadly, still hurt like a *bitch* when they caught you.

Marides still tried to cuddle her at night, and Rhidi went as far as wrapping her in place with paracord within her rucksack. By the third night, Rhidi just gave up and let the stupid little Pwah cuddle up into her fur since she always escaped her bindings. The last bit of training involved close quarter battle training, which was rough on everyone due to the sim-round welts, and field communications.

On the fifth day’s morning, they broke camp. Rhidi packed away her things, her disgusting sack of laundry, and helped Acici and Marides break down their shelter halves. To their conjoined annoyance, they were then tasked with *replacing* the rocks back to the dried out river bed.

“I knew there wasn’t a fire.” Alias snarled, packing the rocks back into their fast-packs. “I just *knew* they were going to do this shit to us.”

With the rocks placed back into their natural habitat, they staged their rucksacks and began their final obstacle course. It was easy, of course, since nearly all of the off-worlders were already well trained in their fields, and it was childs play as far as they were concerned. It may have been one of the few times they all did better than the Humans, and were quite smug while waiting for all the Humans to finish.

Humans were tough, brutal, dangerous things, but they lacked the agility of Kafyan and Lilgaran feet. The Pwah did as best they could, but the tall walls were a challenge for their shorter heights.

The last bit of the course was the Glory Towers; Using climbing belts made from climbing rope, they had to ascend and descend off the tower at different heights, finally climbing the tallest part of the tower to the top, at which the Warrior’s Drop waited for them.

Like the obstacle course, Rhidi found this quite easy, and rappelling down the wall was a satisfying transition each time she did it. It was oddly fun bouncing off of her boots when she came into contact with the wall, controlling her own descent with the hand she held behind her back.

The final challenge was the final ascension, climbing up the tower to the top of it. It was a sixty foot climb, the only safety precaution being Rhidi’s rigged climbing harness and the belay, way down below. She felt a little less confident here, but it helped that the Humans seemed just as distressed as she was as they all climbed. The ascension wall could handle ten troopers at a time, and Rhidi was the fifth of her stick to make it to the top.

As she came over the edge of the flat-topped tower with a huff of breath, she heaved herself over the edge with a “whoof!”, rolling onto her back and panting hard.

Drill Sergeant Curahee tilted his brown-round adorned head down at her, smiling as he looped his thumbs through his own rigged up climbing harness. “Long way up, ain’t it?”

“Air seems thinner, Drill Sergeant.” Rhidi replied, groaning as she got to her feet.

Drill Sergeant Curahee chuckled, moving Rhidi towards the middle of the tower and unhooking her. “Alright, last part.”

Drill Sergeant Curahee then stood back, gripped her by the belt, then pointed a bladed hand towards the edge of the flat platform. Rhidi looked at the Human, confused, but poked her head over the edge.

It was a sheer drop, all the way down towards a giant, deep pool of water. Rhidi felt her blood run cold as she saw troopers sitting beside the pool, wet and drying out in the sun while catching their breath.

“You want me to jump over the edge into that fucking thing?!” Rhidi barked out, shrinking back from the edge and coming down onto her rump.

“You want me to jump over the edge into that fucking thing, *Drill Sergeant*.” Drill Sergeant Curahee corrected as he let go of her belt, and stepped gamely over to the edge of the tower, leaning over the edge as his safety line went taught.

Just that action alone nearly made Rhidi scream.

“This is the Warrior’s Drop, Private Rhidi.” Drill Sergeant Curahee said, leaning back from the edge with a face now sternly set. “You wash out here, you wash out for *good*. Our MOS is to drop from space and land onto the surfaces of other planets. If you can’t muster the courage for sixty feet, you won’t manage the courage for two hundred miles. You gonna wash out on me, Private Rhidi? You want me to call your model mommy and have her send you a shuttle?”

Rhidi looked up at the Human with wide eyes, her tail tucked between her legs; Sixty feet into water was no joke, and tons of things could go wrong, but she didn’t have time to consider much else before Drill Sergeant Curahee pulled her to her feet by her climbing harness.

“Step off of the ledge, do not jump-.” Drill Sergeant Curahee began, but Rhidi’s legs gave out from under her, and she came down onto the deck again. Drill Sergeant Curahee rolled his eyes. “Private Rhidi, if you do not jump off of my tower, you will be walking down loser’s lane where everyone will be able to *see* you wash out.”

His words were cut short as another recruit came over the edge of the climbing tower, and Drill Sergeant Curahee turned, smiling. “Ah, Private Morris.”

Rhidi’s heart did another flip as she spun around on her knees to see Morris standing to his feet, and dusting off his hands. 

“This the big drop, Drill Sergeant?” Morris asked, then smiled at Rhidi. “Private Rhidi.”

“M-Morris.” Rhidi stammered out, and Morris’s face fell. He instantly understood she was scared, and his concern was open in his eyes.

Drill Sergeant Curahee unhooked Private Morris and led him to the edge. “Don’t mind her, she’s about to wash out.”

Morris looked over his shoulder, and Rhidi could see that the thought of her washing out caused him a fair bit of disappointment. Humans only hid their emotions when they wanted, and Morris wanted Rhidi to know what he was thinking without saying a word.

“Point your boot tips.” Drill Sergeant Curahee began, pointing a bladed hand over the edge. “Don’t flail, keep your body straight, and walk off the edge.”

Morris spared one last look at Rhidi, then smiled. “See you at the bottom, Rhidi.”

Rhidi scrabbled up to her feet with a scrape of paw-boots as Morris stepped over the edge, disappearing from view with a whip of clothing hitting the wind. 

There was a long pause, then a splash and a distant cheer.

Drill Sergeant Curahee slowly turned to Rhidi, and he folded his arms as he spoke. “What’s the call, Kafya? Are you scared to tread where Humans show no fear?”

Rhidi pinned her ears back, a short whine building in her throat as she slowly came up to a hunched, standing position. Morris was down there, and if she took loser’s lane down, he would know she was not brave enough to jump into some stupid water.

At the same time, Rhidi knew she could not step off; She would shrink back as soon as she saw the edge.

So, Rhidi closed her eyes and began to run.

Issue solved.

“Private! Private wait!” Drill Sergeant Curahee cackled as he ran after Rhidi, but she was already too far ahead, leaping over the edge of the platform.

Rhidi’s legs were still attempting to tread air, and she didn’t dare open her eyes, her tail flagging out behind her all the way down. She hit the water shins first, and the temperature of the water shocked Rhidi’s eyes open more than the impact.

She floated for a moment in the grass-strewn water, then started kicking for the offered hand she could see above her.

It looked like Morris’s, so Rhidi kicked hard towards the hand, reaching out with her own paw-hand. She got close enough to grab onto it, and she was hauled from the water with a swift jerk.

Right into the grinning, scarred face of Drill Sergeant Almoore.

“Private, did you just fucking jump off the Warrior’s Drop with your eyes closed at a full run?” Drill Sergeant Almoore asked, her shoulders attempting to not buck with laughter as she hauled Rhidi out of the water like a waterlogged toddler.

Rhidi let out a long breath of air, sinking down onto her now soaking wet rump, then looked up at Drill Sergeant Almoore. “... I couldn’t do it with them open, Drill Sergeant.”

Drill Sergeant Almoore let out a howl of laughter, bending over at the waist as Drill Sergeant Curahee leaned over the edge, laughing just as hard.

“You are crazy as hell, Safetybelt!” Drill Sergeant Curahee yelled out as he guffawed, letting out his own cackle of laughter that echoed down at them.

Rhidi smiled to herself, then looked over at Private Morris to see he was smiling at her as well.

*Worth it*. Rhidi thought to herself, then promptly passed out, her head hitting the wet grass with a muffled smack.",5,1741789419.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Saw everyone else running away from somewhere nearby and ran off as well cause it was in the direction I needed to go, that’s ok I’ll just go around. It was kinda like a more poverty ridden area around a canal. The buildings were all kind stacked on top of each other and thrown together with sheets of metal and plastic. I was behind one guy, he hid in a little hutch. I followed and asked I could hide with him. He joked around and then said yes (the hutch had a half door so I could see and talk to him) but when I opened it he was naked and laughing so I shut the door and took off quickly. Got to the canal and there were these little paddle/pull boats. I couldn’t reach it. Then someone came and filled them with air. I got on and had to take myself around to get to the coffee shop.

by c.w. cobblestone

Exhausted from overwork and lack of sleep, I was barely able to maintain consciousness as I went about my Thursday morning routine. The family hadn’t gone to bed until nearly midnight the previous evening, and thanks to my mandated four hours of curtsey practice, I only got two hours to crash on the basement floor before it was time to wake up and start anew.

When I brought my mistress and master their coffee, I was thankful that Cody didn’t urinate in my mouth. And Mia didn’t yell at me when I knocked on her bedroom door and told her it was time to wake up, so despite being dog-tired, the morning had started out relatively peacefully.

That changed at breakfast. As I was pouring Aunt Sheila’s tea at the breakfast table, I got a sudden cramp in my calf that caused me to buckle and spill hot liquid on the elderly woman’s lap.

BWWWWWWWWWWWWWAPPPPPPP!

My head jerked sideways as the old battleaxe rose and slapped the shit out of me. The blow caught me by surprise, causing me to drop the carafe and spill tea all over the carpet.

“Ooh, I bet that hurt,” I heard Mia joke, accompanied by Brooke’s giggle, as I rubbed my sore cheek, shaking away the stars.

“What are you standing there for?” Liz’s angry voice cut through the fog. “Get a towel and clean up the damn mess you made.”

“And add five check marks,” Aunt Sheila snapped as I scurried to the storeroom to retrieve cleaning supplies.

Cody chuckled. “Dang, Aunt Sheila! You’re not being very nice to our maid.”

“He needs so much work it’s not funny,” the elderly woman answered without a hint of humor.

As I knelt on the floor near the dining room table, sopping up the spilled tea while the family ate breakfast, I was secretly relieved to get off my feet for a few minutes.

“How many check marks do you have now, Mirabella?” Aunt Sheila asked while I worked.

Knowing it would’ve been considered disrespectful to address the dominant senior citizen while on the floor, I stood and curtseyed. “Um, I’m at five, Ma’am. Miss Brooke took away four check marks because she made me walk home from the stables Saturday before she found out I wasn’t responsible for her horse’s saddle coming loose, so I was at negative four. Then my master gave me two check marks last night because I complained that there wasn’t a bed in the basement, and Miss Brooke gave me two more last night because my apron was dingy. That brought it to zero, and you just gave me five, Ma’am.”

The matriarch sniffed. “Well, give yourself two more for that sloppy curtsey. Now, we’re at seven.”

“Yes, Ma’am. Thank you, Ma’am.”

“A proper curtsey is when the maid faces his betters squarely with his head bowed, chin touching his chest, and toes and heels perfectly aligned and a quarter-inch apart,” the old bat explained for what seemed the thousandth time. “The dress is be held with thumbs and forefingers, with both hands on the same plane. Elbows must be extended at forty-five-degree angles.”

I knew all that by heart, although it wasn’t easy to execute. The dip was the hardest part; I had to keep my back perfectly straight, and not lean forward when I dropped into the curtsey, and hold the position for a full “two-Mississippi” before rising. This was an extremely difficult maneuver, especially with my back, feet and calves aching from doing housework in elevator heels all day, followed by four hours of curtsey practice.

Aunt Sheila reached over a plucked a fuzzball from the hem of my dress. “Add another three check marks for that. I don’t like sloppy maids.”

My latest curtsey passed muster, and I retrieved my book from the pocket in my apron to add the devastating ten check marks. I’d made it to Thursday with negative demerits, and had that lasted another day, I’d have been rewarded somehow.

“Wow, so ten check marks means he gets punished tomorrow night AND next week?” Brooke asked.

“Good math, honey,” Cody said. “Yes — unless he can do something to shave off a few check marks, that is.”

Mia giggled and nudged her sister. “Well, I’m sure not gonna take any marks away from him, are you?”

Brook scoffed. “Heck, no.” She glared at me. “In fact, Dad, why don’t we add another two points — just because?”

Cody turned to Liz. “Man, these daughters of yours are MEAN.”

My mistress laughed. “Well, they got it from you.”

Cody pointed at his aunt. “And I got it from her!”

“You sure did,” Aunt Sheila said with a glint in her eye. “And I think we should follow Brooke’s advice, and add five check marks to the maid’s little book.”

“Didn’t you mean ten?” Brooke responded through an evil grin.

“Wow, Aunt Sheila, you’re corrupting my kids.” Cody chuckled before addressing me: “Looks like your Friday nights are going to be booked for the next few months, Mirabella. Ten more check marks; you’re at twenty now? That’s what, five weeks of punishment?”

“Y-yes, Master.”

“So, why are you just standing there, sissy? What do you say when people take the time out to correct you?”

With my ears burning with shame, I faced Brooke and executed my best curtsey. “Um, thank you so much, Miss Brooke, for helping me become a better maid.”

Brooke snorted in response.

I then turned to Aunt Sheila and repeated the ritual: A snappy curtsey and a respectful, “Thank you so much, Ma’am, for helping me become a better maid.”

The old woman sneered. “You’ve got a long way to go before you’ll be anywhere near what you call a ‘better maid.’”

After I apologized for my shortcomings, Liz ordered me to finish cleaning up the tea I’d spilled. By the time I’d finished, it was time to change, wash my face and drive the girls to school.

When I returned home, Cody and his aunt were visiting in the living room, and I said a silent prayer of thanks that I could get on with my housework without being sexually molested by my horny master. 

  
I also had to admit that I was a bit disappointed that my master wouldn't be paying that kind of attention to me.

The rest of the day was fairly uneventful until dinner, when Aunt Sheila announced that her associate had put the fear of G-d into Mrs. Carrington.

“So, Raul called. He talked to your boss today,” the matriarch told Liz.

My mistress perked up. “Really? Wow, so that’s why she was acting so strange. She kept looking at me funny. So, what did he say?”

Aunt Sheila chuckled. “Well, you won’t have to worry about her getting in your business anymore, let’s just put it that way.”

“Why? What happened?”

“He showed her the pictures and she freaked out,” Aunt Sheila said. “He told her she had nothing to worry about as long as she stopped meddling in her employees’ personal lives — and if she should ever fire anyone for their personal behavior, the pictures would find their way to her husband and all her competitors. Raul said she’s definitely scared of those pictures getting out, so you have nothing to worry about.”

“OMG, I can’t thank you enough, Aunt Sheila,” Liz gushed. “Cody always said you were an amazing woman — now, I can see that for myself.”

“Believe me, honey, it was my pleasure,” the old lady said. “I hate seeing people being so judgmental, and she needed to be taught a lesson.”

Brooke’s face brightened. “That means Mirabella can be the maid full-time, just like he’s always wanted.”

“That’s right,” Cody confirmed, looking me up and down. “How’s that sound, Mirabella? You can grow your hair long, instead of wearing that wig. And you can be your true self twenty-four-seven. Aren’t you happy?”

“Um, y-yes, Master,” I fibbed while bobbing a curtsey.

“Those feet weren’t a quarter inch apart, maid,” Aunt Sheila snapped. “Add two more check marks.”

“Yes, Ma’am, I’m sorry, Ma’am.” I dipped again, prompting a regal nod of approval from the aristocratic senior.

As I pulled out my little notebook to pencil in the latest infraction, Mia scoffed.

“Dang, maid, how many check marks is that now?” she asked.

“Um, twenty-two, Miss”

Brooke giggled. “That’s a WHOLE lot of punishment — your hand’s gonna be hurting after writing out all those lines. Unless you decide you’d rather not eat.”

“That must suck, having to decide which punishment to get,” Mia mused. “I wouldn’t want either one of them.” She shuddered at the thought. “Can you imagine not eating for three days? Or, having to stand in the corner and write out a bunch of lines like some little kid?”

Brooke shook her head. “I honestly can’t figure out why anyone would want to be a maid. Only losers like him can really understand it, I guess.”",10,1741789072.0,cuck_femdom_tales,2,1.0,False

Comment
The specimen consists of 3 slightly fragmented cores of liver tissue with 6-7 portal tracts present for evaluation.. 

The hepatocytes present are regular and uniform without visible atypia or ballooning degeneration.

There is no significant steatosis identified within the current sampling provided (<5%). A trichrome stain highlights the portal tracts without evidence of bridging fibrosis (stage 0-1/4). 

Minimal periportal inflammatory activity is present (grade 1/4). A reticulin stain highlights the normal sinusoidal pattern without any nodularity or mass lesion. 

There are no inclusions identified on PAS with and without diastase. There is no stainable iron seen by iron stain. A Rhodanine stain is negative for copper. 

The histopathologic findings are fairly unremarkable and reassuring.

I was sprawled on a sagging couch, a half-empty bottle of Wild Turkey sweating on the coffee table, when she slipped in like a fever dream. Her name was Sasha Wilde, she purred, and she looked the part—long legs sheathed in fishnets, a black leather skirt slit to the hip, and a silk blouse unbuttoned just enough to make a man forget his own name. Her hair was a cascade of midnight, and her eyes, green as poison, locked onto mine with a hunger that set my pulse racing.

“Jake Marlowe, private eye?” she asked, her voice a husky whisper that could melt asphalt. She crossed the room, hips swaying like a slow jazz riff, and perched on the arm of my couch, close enough I could smell the musk of her perfume—something expensive, dangerous, like sex in a back alley.

“Last I checked,” I said, taking a slug of bourbon to steady my nerves. My .38 sat on the table, within reach, but she was the real weapon here. “What’s a knockout like you doing in a dump like this?”

She leaned in, her breath hot against my ear, lips brushing my skin as she spoke. “I need a man who can handle trouble, Jake. My ex—Vince Russo, big shot at Neon Dreams Studio—he’s got pictures. The kind that’d tank my career and his. Last I heard, he’s holed up at his Laurel Canyon pad, playing kingpin with his coke and his goons.” Her fingers trailed down my chest, nails scraping through my shirt, igniting a fire I couldn’t douse. “Get ‘em back for me. Five hundred now, five more when it’s done.”

I grabbed her wrist, stopping her hand before it dipped lower, though every nerve screamed to let it ride. “LA’s a jungle, doll. Russo’s connected—mob ties, dirty cops. You sure you’re worth the heat?”

Her lips curled, a smile sharp as a switchblade. “Try me and find out.” She pulled free, standing to light a cigarette, the match flaring against her skin like a promise. Then she tossed a roll of bills on the table and turned, leather creaking as she sauntered to the door. “Don’t keep me waiting, Marlowe. I get impatient.”

The door clicked shut, leaving me hard up and half-cocked, the bourbon doing nothing for the ache she’d left behind. Los Angeles in ’89 was a neon-lit snake pit—studio sharks, cartel runners, and starlets with claws. I grabbed my trench coat and the .38, the night calling me out into its sweaty, star-streaked sprawl.

I have never really tried to persuade anyone to do anything. My mind seems to work on a different plane than a lot of people, so I gave up on being persuasive or changing someone's opinion a long time ago.

But let's pretend it was my job to convert people to a specific religion. I would not go door to door of course. That is a tough sell. As an individual if it was my job to try and convert someone. What I would do is to lead a happy, secure, and comfortable life in my religion.

I would not try to sell anything. I would not try to persuade anyone of anything. I would just be happy and content in my own life and religion. Then if they feel something missing in their lives, they could look to mine to see what my system has to offer and its appeal. Maybe then they will convert on their own.

Obliviously I am not trying to convert anyone. But it would be nice to have a girlfriend someday :)

It goes without saying that I am horrible salesman. Always have been. I could not sell anything.

I am not going to try and sell myself to a potential dating partner. I never could do it. I am willing to bet I will never be able to. But that is totally fine :)

I will be super happy and content in my life no matter what. No one knows how to have fun like me. I hate to say I am the best- but perhaps I am. I am a relatively intelligent guy in his late 30s with autism. No relationship yet (not a huge surprise lol).

But I will be dammed if I am not having more fun than the vast majority of people. People seem to complain about their lives, their jobs, the world around them all the time. I do not see the world that way. I think the world is a wonderful place with a near infinite about of possibilities for fun and happiness.

My whole point being is I think I am just going to keep living my happy and content life just the way I am :)

I hope it appeals to people. I am very non-traditional of course. But people do not seem super happy in traditional roles. So, I am offering an alternative. A different way of living. A different path to happiness, fun and contentment.

I know there are a lot of unhappy people out there. I hope at least one of them finds me and gets a little bit happier :)

1j9l2d0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j9l2d0,Is this insect poop?,"Hey there, i thought for over a year I might have bedbugs, because I do get little bites that appear in groups now and then, sometimes more sometimes less. 

I never saw any bedbugs, even after staying awake at night many many times wirh a flashlight and looking everywhere. I did see some carpet beetles, some book lice, occasional flies (only one day i had many because I forgot to take the trash out, before I was gone for a week) and but got rid of them immediately on the same day, occasional fruit flies and sadly moths that I got rid off, but they then reappeared.

I did move once 6 months ago, becasue of the bad condition of the flat, like the reappearing insects, very old unrenovated house, also it smelled strongly of smoke somehow now and then,, even though I don't  smoke. 

In the new place I took the furniture apart but I didn't see any insects, but I saw these brown stains, which i never noticed before somehow on the bed and bookshelf. 

Is this insect poop? Or just coffee stains or sth? Is it definitely not bedbug poop?

I had the exterminator come and he couldn't find any bedbug évidence, but he also couldn't tell me what the stains were. 

I never once saw a bedbug though in the old or the new flat. 

In the new flat I only found one single carpet beetle, 2 book lice and one spider and occasional fruit flies whenever I buy basil in the last 6 months.

I put sticky tape everywhere, but there's nothing on it. And whenever I looked at night I could see nothing. But I still get bites and I smell a sweetish smell in the bedroom. 
I live in western Europe btw.

My plan is to finish building the boxes for the rest of the kitchen and then get a sprayer and repaint all the cabinets.

Do you guys think printable caulk will be ok to use where the box meets the ceiling and back wall or will it crack and look like crap? I know I gotta do something to continue the trim down the bottom part of the cabinet, but I'm not sure what yet.

Any advice appreciated, I'm new and making a square box/faceplate and scribing ain't as easy as the videos lol",12,1741788884.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,0,0.94,False
