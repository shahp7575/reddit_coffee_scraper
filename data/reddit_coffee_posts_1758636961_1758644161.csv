I chose to go with butter as that’s what a lot of people seemed to favor. However, this triggered my binge eating and I admittedly over ate the butter. Like I had two sticks in a day hahaha. I try to track so I know this was more than needed. I want to switch to beef tallow as that’s does not taste great to me so it doesn’t trigger my binge eating. However, I want to have around 30 grams at the start of the day without food, kinda like what people do with butter and coffee. I tried mixing it with beef broth today and it was good, but I realized most of the tallow dried to the cup making the premise pointless haha. Do I just need to take this like a shot?

1nolhr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyersNotes/comments/1nolhr9/what_is_the_trick_to_keeping_opened_bags_of/,What is the trick to keeping opened bags of cheese or coffee from going stale so quickly in the pantry?,"https://i.redd.it/dsydpiv9uxqf1.gif

You know how the pantry has that one specific smell? It’s like a mix of crackers, onions, and… disappointment. I was staring at a bag of coffee beans the other day, and it had that sad, flat aroma. It reminded me of my grandma’s kitchen, where she kept everything in old jars with those clunky metal lids. Nothing ever stayed truly crisp.



I used to think it was just inevitable. You open a bag of shredded cheese with grand plans for fajitas, and a week later it’s dotted with white specks, resigned to its fate. I’d try all the little hacks—rolling the bag down, clipping it shut, even transferring it to a container that never quite sealed right. It felt like a constant, low-level race against time.



Then a friend was telling me about her obsession with stocking up on seasonal fruit. She mentioned this little gadget she uses, almost as an afterthought. She said she just places the bag’s open end in this thing, it whirs for a second, and suddenly the bag is tight and smooth, all the air gone. I was so focused on her story about the peaches that the method itself barely registered at first.



It wasn't until I tried it myself that it clicked. The real trick isn't a trick at all; it's just removing the air. That’s the entire secret. That little machine doesn't add anything magical; it just takes away the one thing that causes the problem. It feels less like a kitchen chore and more like a neat little science experiment.



Now, my pantry smells different. The coffee actually smells like coffee, and I don’t feel that little pang of guilt when I see a half-used bag of almonds. It’s one of those small, quiet victories that just makes daily life feel a tiny bit more efficient.

1nole5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1nole5y/the_only_productivity_advice_you_need/,The only productivity advice you need.,"I recently read ""Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals"" by Oliver Burkeman. The average human life is about 4,000 weeks long. As the remaining weeks on our 4,000-week calendar pass by, there's pressure to make the most of them. Each of our remaining weeks are like glass jars passing on a conveyor. If we fill each jar as it passes by, we feel like we're justifying our existence, but if we let too many pass by unfilled, we feel we've wasted them. We don't want to see partially filled jars go by, so we take on more responsibility than we can handle, and we think of a thousand cool things we want to do before we die.

Imagine all the tasks you have to complete to uphold your responsibilities at work and at home are like tiny pebbles piled up in the corner of your mental factory. And your bucket list items are like big rocks piled up in another corner of your mental factory. As you fill your time jars with pebbles and rocks, you live with a constant anxiety that you won't have enough time to do everything you need to do or want to do. Oliver Burkeman calls this existential overwhelm. If you try to eliminate existential overwhelm with better time management systems and efficiency hacks, you'll run into the efficiency trap. This is because the faster you clear the deck of things you need to do, like emails, tasks, and things to clean and organize, the faster your deck is filled with new things to do. If efficiency is your goal, you'll never achieve peace of mind and you'll always feel like you're playing catch-up. The anxiety from existential overwhelm, the frustration generated by the efficiency trap, and the pressure to fill your remaining weeks with activity makes your limited time on this planet unnecessarily stressful.

However, there's a way to eliminate existential overwhelm, avoid the efficiency trap, and enjoy your remaining weeks while living a productive life.

Several years ago, Warren Buffett was boarding his personal plane when his pilot asked him for goal-setting advice. Buffett told his pilot to make a list of 25 life goals and arrange them from the most important to the least. After the pilot thoughtfully organized his goals, Buffett said, ""Now throw out goals 6 through 25 and never do them under any circumstance"". Life is too short to let the moderately appealing goals in slots 6 through 25 distract you from completing the life-changing goals in slots 1 through 5.

Our modern world provides us with an inexhaustible supply of things that seem worth doing, which leads to a bottomless bucket list. The irony is that the more we want to do, the less we accomplish, because the more activities we have to choose from, the more we overthink, perpetually plan, and live in a continuous state of existential overwhelm.

If you want to eliminate existential overwhelm, create and maintain an open and closed life list. Start by capturing everything you wish to do someday on the open list. This might be businesses you want to start, skills you want to learn, and countries you want to visit. Now, move three to five goals over to the closed list and don't look at the open list again until you complete or forever abandon one of the goals on your closed list. It's good to have at least three goals on your closed list because there will be times you must wait for a decision or event before proceeding on one or more of your goals.

Once you move three to five items from your open list to your closed list, fully accept that you may never complete the items on your open list. After emotionally accepting that fact, your only concern in life is getting the three to five items off your closed list before you die.

When you have an open and closed list system, it's like you're getting a truck to come and take away most of the big rocks in your mental factory, and being left with a few rocks you know you can manage. After chipping away at a remaining rock and putting the entirety of the rock in your time jars, you can then call the truck driver back and select a new rock, instead of just having a bunch of rocks hanging around pulling at your psyche. The added bonus of having an open and closed list is that you're less likely to procrastinate because you know the only way that you make room for new and exciting activities is to get an item off your closed list and create a vacancy for a new goal.

Once you've started eliminating existential overwhelm, it's time to avoid the efficiency trap. The more efficiently you answer email, the more email you receive. The more efficiently you conduct meetings, the more meetings you'll be asked to lead. And the more efficiently you clean dishes, the more often you'll be put on dish duty. So, be careful what you choose to be efficient at. The more efficient you are at something, the more of that something you tend to do.

As a highly driven individual, you may want to be great at everything you do, but being great at low-value activities usually means a good portion of your 4,000 weeks will feel meaningless. Rather than doing everything excellently, practice **s**trategic underachievement. Identify all the low-return activities you must do to uphold your responsibilities at home and at work. Then, look at each of those activities and ask yourself: ""What is the absolute bare minimum I can do so I can make time for what matters most?""

Can you clean your house once a week and stop cleaning when you feel it's 80% clean and still feel satisfied? Can you cut the lawn half as frequently and still feel like you're managing your yard? Can you take twice as long to respond to email without angering anyone? You'll probably find that doing just enough and being ""good enough"" at most tasks will allow you to stay on top of your responsibilities and create time for what matters most. Your time is limited, so reduce your standards for most activities, make some trade-offs, and embrace strategic underachievement in most areas so you can spend most of your time being excellent in a select few areas. John Acuff, author of ""Finish,"" says, ""When you decide in advance what things you're going to bomb, you remove the sting of shame.""

Now that we've dealt with existential overwhelm and have a way to avoid efficiency traps, it's time to enrich your remaining weeks. The busier you get trying to fill your remaining weeks with activity, the faster life will pass you by. But you can subjectively slow down time, eliminate busyness, and savor your remaining weeks by embracing your finiteness and conducting last-time reflections.

You and I don't know when our life is going to end, so it's best that we assume that every experience is happening for the last time. This might sound gloomy on the surface, but when you experience each activity as if it's the last time you're going to experience it, you stop rushing from activity to activity and slow down your experience. When you treat a kiss with your partner like it's the last kiss you'll have, or a cup of coffee you're enjoying is the last cup of coffee you'll ever have, or the song you're listening to is the last time you get to enjoy music, you'll get lost in the moment and have a richer experience, and stop worrying about the passage of time.

Many of us assume that because we've done something a thousand times, we will do it a thousand times more, so everything feels routine and we stop paying attention to what we're doing. But if you stop taking things for granted and start assuming that everything you're doing, you're doing for the last time, even the most mundane experiences can be filled with beauty and enjoyment.

In the end, most time management systems create existential overwhelm, efficiency traps, and a never-ending sense of busyness, which leads to unnecessary stress and erodes what time we have left on this planet. But we can live happy and productive lives by embracing our finiteness and working with an open and closed list, embracing strategic underachievement to make time for what matters, and practicing last-time reflections.",1,1758643367.0,productivity,0,1.0,False

Give IV adenosine rapid bolus.

Rationale: For a hemodynamically stable patient with regular, narrow-complex SVT (likely AVNRT), the initial management is vagal maneuvers; if these fail or immediate conversion is preferred, a rapid IV bolus of adenosine is the drug of choice because it transiently blocks AV nodal conduction and often terminates the re-entrant circuit.

The Man

The obnoxious sound of Jack’s alarm clock jolted him awake at 8 a.m. Slow and sluggish in an attempt to roll himself out of bed, he noticed from his bedroom window rain was pouring. The neighborhood was darkened by heavy rain clouds and just then a subtle sense of joy overtook him. He loved the rain.

He couldn’t come to a conclusion for why he liked the stormy weather, but he felt it on days like this. Jack made his way downstairs to brew a cup of coffee and see his parents, who had left for their week’s vacation to Sicily, Italy. “Oh, yeah,” he thought to himself, forgetting they had already left around 5 a.m. for their 8 a.m. flight. Jack was unemployed and had no obligations at home for the most part. He was a good and respectful kid, though he had no sort of inclination to work. Entertainment and indulging in hedonistic pleasures was almost a daily routine for him since graduating high school. The priorities he would have after leaving his parents’ home—finding his passions and the question of what career path he would venture into—was too daunting to answer. He was all too comfortable.

Jack was in the kitchen grabbing the coffee his parents made earlier in the morning. He proceeded making toast, poured himself a heaping bowl of Apple Jacks, and made his way into his room to play some games on his Xbox. The type of games he enjoyed were first-person shooters like Call of Duty, along with a few cups of coffee just to get himself awake. Jack aspired to be a skilled gaming personality since streaming was now so prevalent. The success of many YouTube creators and gamers Jack grew up watching motivated that vision he had for himself. The rain began to pour down harder, with echoes of thunder nearby. In the midst of his gaming, Jack noticed he felt a sense of comfort. He realized he liked the coziness he felt on days like this, the rain also gave him a sense of relief from the guilty feelings of complacency, knowing others were inside as well due to the stormy weather. “Most people are probably having some sort of leisure time as well,” he thought while being deeply fixated on his gam.

As Jack continued gaming and eating what remained of his cereal. he was interrupted by the sound of a few knocks at the front door. He ignored them at first, avoiding the chance of answering to some salesman or deliveryman so he could carry on with his leisurely morning in peace. He knew what to do but his laziness overtook him frequently. He heard more knocks again, just as the first. Out of annoyance, he removed his headset and tossed it onto his bed, got up from his chair, and made his way downstairs to answer the door. It was a FedEx driver delivering a package and needed a signature of approval. It was for his fathers, whose name was Richard Campbell. Jack made a lousy attempt at his signature on the driver’s tablet; the man thanked him, nodded, and was off.

Jack stood there for a moment and peered over to the right at his friend Stephen’s house to see if he was home, since he hadn’t texted him, inviting him to play games yet. There were no cars in his driveway nor on the street in front of his home. Jack remembered he had his community college classes today and decided to text him later that evening to join him on Call of Duty. The sky was murky, and it was still raining considerably hard. Jack closed the door and went back inside.

After placing the box down, he saw his car keys on the counter, reminding him he should grab a snack for later, knowing full well he would want something while gaming with Stephen. He pondered where to go as he quickly threw on shoes and a coat, left, and walked to his old Honda Civic parked in the driveway. The rain lessened a bit but was still more than a light drizzle. Jack lived in the suburbs of Huntington Beach, California, in a safe neighborhood, home to many middle-class families and a select few of the wealthy. His parents did quite well for themselves, so you could say Jack’s family lived modestly. He started driving making his way to the local 7-Eleven a few blocks down, where he went roughly every other day. He knew the clerk since childhood, but the man strangely never said a word; as he recollected the thought, the realized drew a smile.

He approached the driveway entrance, and it was packed even in the rain, yet it was close to lunchtime. He parked several spots from the store that were available. Mildly annoyed, he got out to walk inside and noticed a peculiar man—not homeless-looking, but rummaging through the trash, clearly looking for something. He was roughly six feet tall, wore a large jacket, denim pants, and a strange hat that was almost fitting for the outfit. Jack walked up and hesitated, seeing the man was partially blocking the door. He tried circumnavigating his way around him to go inside without notice. Then the man peered right, noticing Jack, and said,

“Sir, sir, have you seen a knife anywhere? You know, one that flips out and it’s about this big,” gesturing oddly with his hands.

“No, I haven’t. I just got here,” Jack replied, confused.

The man replied back, “Oh…” and proceeded to look. Jack opened the door, and before closing it the man said a bit louder, “You sure?” He had a pocket knife in his hand, as he’d described a second ago, and said, “It was in my coat pocket on my right side the whole time.”

“I never checked it!” he yelled out, followed by some uncanny laughs, while making strange eye contact with Jack.

“Glad you found it,” Jack said nervously. He closed the door quickly, considering telling the clerk to call the police. The clerk was in the corner near the back door, texting—unaware of anything that had just happened at the front with the man. Jack looked back towards the door and saw the man was walking off, so he decided to get his things quickly, check out, and go home. In a haste, and while taking some glances back towards the front entrance and glass windows for the man, Jack grabbed a bag of BBQ Ruffles chips, a Hundred Grand chocolate bar, and an original Red Bull in the span of ten seconds. He went to pay and considered telling the clerk about the man and the interaction but he didn’t, he was now in a hurry to leave. He bought his things and said, “Have a good one.”

The clerk didn’t say anything except for a nod of acknowledgement. Jack walked out from the store and noticed the man was not to be seen, but as he walked a few steps he spotted him sitting in a black Jeep Cherokee a few spots from him. He walked speedily to his car to leave and suddenly the man, a few paces away, noticed him again, calling out, “Hey, kid!”

“Thanks for the help anyways”. “Who knows what I would’ve done tonight.” “I don’t have much money.” “I’m pretty forgetful, wouldn’t you say?” he added, now looking at Jack with that strange look as before, except this time almost grinning and not breaking eye contact.

Jack didn’t respond; he just wanted to get into the car and leave. He didn’t know what to make of that and didn’t care to find out by entertaining the conversation. He began to back out, trying his best to avoid looking at the man still parked. He left 7/11 and while driving, he felt an acute sense of paranoia that the man might be following him, not knowing what to expect at this point. As he started driving, the rain began to pick up again, setting the mood for something unsettling like this—coincidentally. He persisted, peering into his rearview window the entire way back home. Jack was having a hard time shaking the image of the man’s grin and creepy interaction they had.

In almost no time Jack made it back to the house and pulled into the driveway. Getting out of the car, he made his way to the front door, then immediately stopped and felt the need to park his car in the garage. He just didn’t want to be noticed, even though he felt his precautions of being seen were a bit dramatic. He got back in the car and pulled into the garage.

“I’m an idiot,” he thought, going through scenarios in his head and concluding all of that could’ve just been a strange man looking for his knife who talked and gazed at him in a strange manner. “I don’t know man”—the way he looked at me was almost menacing, but regardless, that was sketchy,” he thought, almost finding room for humor in the situation. He felt relieved to be home at the very least and clicked the button to close the garage. The garage was  beginning to close, he looked out and saw a black car passing by and made a momentary flash of eye contact with a man driving, wearing a hat, who gazed inside at him as the garage door was creeping down about a quarter of the way. The garage now made its way shut.

Jack couldn’t tell with certainty if it was the man from earlier, but seeing a black car and that the man inside appeared to be wearing a hat like the one at the store made his stomach sink and his body tense up with fear. His heartbeat raced for a brief moment at the eerie thought of the man passing by. Consequently, his mind started piecing together terrifying scenarios for what could be going on. He then began thinking the man from earlier now knew where he lived and that became the only thing Jack could think about. “What if he pulled back around and he’s in front of the house looking for me?” he thought. He frantically locked the garage door and took his bag of snacks up to his room, where he sat for a while, listening to the rain and looking out his bedroom window for any whereabouts of the man. There was no one to be seen except for a few passing cars and the empty neighborhood.

Jack was reluctant to startle his parents telling them what happened as they were far away in Italy, so he texted Stephen explaining his situation. Thirty minutes went by with no response. Hours then went by and Jack never ceased to leave his window in fear of the man coming. He decided to get back on his games without his headset in order to hear anything going on outside that would raise any alarm in him. Stephen finally texted back just as Jack hopped into his first match of a different game called Fortnite. He felt partially relieved looking at Stephen’s text saying, “That’s creepy, man. I don’t think he’s out to get you though haha. Wanna hop on some games in a while?” “I’ll be home in a couple of hours.”

Jack knew Stephen couldn’t have known the severity of the situation, having not experienced it. “How could he not be creeped out and paranoid if he were in my shoes right now?” he thought. He would, Jack concluded, and the same worries came back and began to persist. A couple worried hours later he hopped on the games with Stephen around 7 p.m. Stephen had a long day of school and had gone out to dinner with some girl he recently met. As they were both playing Fortnite, Stephen asked, “Anything else happen since we talked?”

“Not really,” Jack replied. “I just keep thinking about it, but honestly I think I was tripping myself out thinking about it too much even though the situation was strange, if you know what I mean.”

“Yeah that would’ve creeped me out too, but those bums at 7/11 are always up to some weird stuff so I wouldn’t think too much of it… I’m glad you answered my call though, knowing the guy didn’t get you,” Stephen said jokingly.

Jack laughed and said, “No, for real—you should’ve seen me. I ran up to my room looking out the window for hours, thinking the guy was after me or something. Call me a lunatic or whatever, but in the moment I was ready to grab a knife in the kitchen and fight this guy if he pulled up to the house.”

“No, you wouldn’t,” Stephen said, laughing. “You’d be under your bed texting 911 or something , let’s be real.” Laughing again.

“Nahhhh,” Jack said sarcastically, knowing he was probably right. They both laughed.

They continued playing for hours until Stephen had to go finish homework he was doing last second for his World History class. They got off the games, talked for a second, then hung up the phone. Jack was now alone but was left more at ease—either from Stephen’s jokes and downplaying the situation, poking fun at Jack’s overreaction, or just having another person to talk to, to alleviate the end of what Jack thought was a seemingly chaotic day.

There wasn’t much to do. He had already spoken to his parents that night on the phone and caught up on how things were going. He decided he’d get to bed shortly after playing a few more games. The rain was settled but kept coming about in intermittent spurts. Jack continued playing his games longer than anticipated and stayed up a while longer after that as well. He checked some texts and watched a couple YouTube videos in bed until he slowly drifted off into sleep. Something woke him—he overheard a thud or the sound of a subtle snap echo in the house. He couldn’t make it out, being in a deep sleep as it woke him. It wasn’t an unusual occurrence for that to happen, he thought, and laid back down, tired. Jack a a few moments, now heard the sound of a car out front, it was a neighbor pulling in across the street. Even after Jack’s relief, he still felt on edge and on high alert. The couple of sounds seemed to revive some anxiety that had vanished earlier. Lying in his bed, he looked out again, then one more time a few moments later out of paranoia and a last attempt of reassurance he could sleep soundly.

Another snap, the same as before, was heard in the house, only further. He nervously drew himself from bed and went to investigate. In extreme hesitation, he poked his head looking towards the dim hallway. Jack gained some confidence and scoured the upstairs while turning the lights on. He looked out the windows of his parents’ room at the backyard, then peered out over the railing down to the downstairs hallway. I guess the house is just creaking and I’m being a little girl about it? Jack thought. In frustration, he turned the lights off, shut his bedroom door, locked it, and went to bed.

The midnight rain began to pick up again and into the night. It persisted as a soothing white noise, with Jack’s window being cracked. His frustrations before bed allowed  his worries to vanish and sleep like the man of a household does—comfortably, but with one eye open, as they say. During Jack’s sleep, the sound of a slow-moving vehicle could be heard pulling up just across the street.

The locking engagement sound of the car being put into park was enough to wake Jack again. Jack took a second to peer out his window in fatigue, being as tired as he was and now flustered. He looked out and saw it a black Jeep Cherokee parked across the street of his house. His heart raced and skipped a beat as he looked away from the window. “Is it the guy?” he asked himself with the an uncertain fear now settling in him. His hands became clammy, he went to look again, but nobody got out. The windows to the car were dark and he couldn’t make anything out from where he was. He laid back in bed, terrified of the thought of knowing the person saw him look out. If it was the man, then I assume he saw me attempting to see if it was him knowing full well id be terrified. What is this!? he thought to himself angrily and fearfully.

A car door then opened and shut. Jacks head lay against the wall on the foot of his. He couldn’t bear himself to look again. Footsteps a moment later made their way toward the house in an offbeat rhythm and veered off to the left and stopped and then picked up again slowly . Jack boldly made a peek out the window and couldn’t see anybody. “What?” “What!?” he said to himself quietly in immense confusion. “Is he sneaking up on me?” Jack wanted to confirm the front door was locked but couldn’t in fear of leaving his room. His mind was nearing mode of fight or flight. He stopped himself from thinking in order to hear what was going on.

“Where did the man go?” Jack said quietly to himself, trembling. He could barely move a leg or a muscle. He didn’t want a remnant of sound to be heard from his room. He sat there waiting and listening closely.

The faintest sound of the front door slowly creeping open could be heard from downstairs. Jack nearly fainted, his heart was beating out of his chest. The door had been unlocked since his 7/11 trip. He stayed put in his room silently, with his whole body intensely sweating as the trepidation of the man below consumed him.

There was no sound to be heard. Jack tried sliding his window open slowly while in a shaky haze, listening attentively to the sounds below. He quietly got the window fully open, and he waited there. The silence was an ominous thing—it was unbearable. A light step could be heard and then another. The front door then closed silently. The man could suddenly be heard running to and up stairs. Jack froze, unable to move and the man immediately tried forcing the door open but couldn’t. Jack, still on the verge of screaming and fainting, noticed the man stopped abruptly and said in his deep, low “come out kid,” “I know your in there” “I saw you look at me from outside your window” as he began laugh. Jack heard him shuffle back a few paces away from the door.

Jack, on the verge of collapse, listened, then—Snap!

Jack let out a yell. The man’s foot blasted through the door, making a huge opening, and the man got down on a knee to reach his left arm through the hole and up to unlock the latch on the other side of the door. He fiddled with the lock and pushed  the door open, now looked at Jack. Jack instinctively drew himself to the window as the man ran in, Jack climbed out to the edge, and without much hesitation leaped from the second-story window to the grass. He rolled on his shoulder hard enough to feel quite injured on getting up, but he still had the ability to run for his life. 

The man’s loud footsteps could be heard running down and smacking the wooden stairs in pursuit of Jack, who made a run for it as fast as he could. He made his way sprinting down the harrowing street of his neighborhood and could see the man in the distance wildly running after him. Jack almost started crying and yelled out, “Help!” loudly and desperately a couple of times as he tried keeping a steady gap between him and the man.

There wasn’t much use—the fact was nobody was awake to be immediate help. Jack kept his pace and he began to lose the man behind him, making his way around the corner to his local park. The man relentlessly followed around the corner, but Jack was then most of the way through the park as he passed numerous pine trees and the dark empty playground. He now entered the other side of the neighborhood.

Jack was exhausted from running, he made it a few more blocks down and hid behind some shrubs he spotted, bordering the front of a neighbor’s house without being seen. “I’ll lay here and watch for a while”, he said, covered in sweat. His stomach and his arms now resting on the dirt ground. He laid there and watched from behind the shrub, hidden. Jack sat there lying for a few minutes until finally, the man came walking by—who he could see had the same outfit from before: The large jacket, denim pants along with a strange hat who was looking around aimlessly in search for Jack and appeared very frustrated. Nearing closer in Jack’s direction, he could hear the man muttering words and swearing to find him.

“That fucki— that fucking kid, I’ll find him and kill him.”

His delirious state of mind and words just spoken startled Jack immensely. He couldn’t believe that was the same man from yesterday. He couldn’t believe he actually had vile intentions the entire time. It was all a sick trick to kill some young kid, he thought to himself, thinking back to yesterday, trembling again. He watched as the man continued on, so Jack reached for his phone. It was at home on his bed.

“Damnit!” he whispered. “It makes sense—since I left the house suddenly, but not grabbing it at a time like this?”

Jack allowed for a few more minutes to pass with the idea in mind of making his way back home, hoping he could build up the courage to. A few more minutes passed—it was time. He slowly crept upward about halfway, made a few glances of confirmation and started walking toward the street. He wanted to run, but if the man was near he thought he’d run into him unexpectedly not hearing him or draw attention to the sound of himself if he wasn’t walking cautiously. The streetlights gave an incandescent and eerie feel as he made his way along down the street towards the park. It had stopped raining as before but a light sprinkle could be felt as Jack proceeded home.

He passed through the park to his side of the neighborhood. Not once had a car passed he noticed, and at an instant, a cat made its way across the street, startling Jack. He continued walking and his steps grew at a faster pace as he was approaching his house looking around both sides of the street, paranoid and desperate to get into the house. He ran up, locked the front door with haste, and quickly got upstairs. He grabbed his phone from his bed and walked downstairs. He was peering out the living room windows, keeping watch for the man, as he called 911. 

He saw something outside—he couldn’t make it out, it was hard to tell in the dark of night what it was. A car passed by making it hard to tell what was going on as Jack waited for someone to answer the line. “Hurry and pick up please , please” he said, with extreme impatience. The operator answered. “Hello, this is 911, what is your emergency?”

Jack gave the woman a quick summary of what happened at 7-Eleven with the mysterious man. He quickly summarized the initial interaction, the man passing moments later in his car, seeing his house, and the later visit to the house that evening and how he snuck up into to his room breaking the door, chasing him out and down the street. The operator listened attentively to the seriousness of the situation, taking notes and asking further questions.

“Can you give me a description of what this man looks like?”

Jack turned away from the window, giving the reply.

The man was staring at Jack with his hallow eyes, creeping from behind the corner wall of the kitchen who’d been waiting for him to enter the house to kill him. He was smiling insanely, his body mainly exposed by the kitchen wall with his pocket knife in hand.

“Ahhhhhhh!” Jack screamed and cried, dropping his phone. He picked up a two-foot candlestick stand nearest to him at the window.

The man took a step forward, making himself fully visible, and ran at Jack with a sinister and crooked look saying “I’m going to get you this time.” Laughing wildly. Jack swung as he neared, hitting his side. The man tried grabbing Jack’s shirt, but Jack barely slipped away as he lunged to the side and ran toward the dining table. The man followed laughing, running around swinging his knife towards Jack, he slashed his arm from across the table. Jack yelled out in pain as he got into a desperate position away on the far side of the table across from the man. The clean slash on his arm was bleeding badly. The table gave a few feet of distant between them. The man stood there wide eyed and suddenly climbed up on top knocking everything over. He stepped over toward Jack in another attempt to grab him but Jack smacked his arm away and ran toward the stairs. The man leaped off the table running quickly after him.

The man was fast running up the steps and caught up to Jack grabbing him by the shirt, ready to stab him near the top of the stairs. Jack then spun around quickly, in a full 180 degrees, and swung the candle stand with all his might and struck the man badly on the side of the head. The man immediately dropped to the steps at Jacks feet, bleeding, and tumbled down to the bottom of the stairs to the living room floor. He lay there unconscious.

Jack started sobbing profusely, not letting go of the candle stand out of fear. “What just happened?” He said as he continued sobbing in shock of everything that happened and what he had just done to the man. This went on for a moment but then he couldn’t endure another second of being at the top of the stairs looking down at the man. He didn’t know for sure if he was dead or not but he appeared like it. Jack ran down the stairs, wiping his tears, and grabbed the knife off the floor that the man dropped after being hit, and called 911 again. He made the call from the sidewalk, looking into his house with the front door open.

He was traumatized and couldn’t bear being in the vicinity of the man who was likely dead. The cops soon came and were stunned by the situation. Jack’s parents and his friends later on couldn’t believe what happened that night. Most of all, Jack couldn’t believe it. He was sitting there partially in a state of delirium and haze as the authorities made their way inside to investigate the scene. Jack stayed outside with a few cops who comforted him and asked a series of questions. He then received assistance from a peri medic to address his gash on his arm from the knife earlier. The man was declared dead due to the mighty blow to the head with the candle stand. Jack was thinking how such a seemingly perfect day turned into a nightmare yet how lucky he was to have managed to stay alive. He thought how going to a 7 Eleven now wouldn’t be the same anymore, even just being at home alone, you can’t trust anybody. The prior worries Jack had of the man were now warranted with the event’s that played out that evening. This moment never departed Jack’s memory, but the lasting trauma improved with time. He went on to live a fulfilling life and venture into those things we mentioned in the beginning of the story with success.

That day Jack learned a couple things: trust your instincts and never, never leave your front door unlocked.

The End.

1nol9ln,https://i.redd.it/91c0ooatsxqf1.png,Rayhaan Pacific🍊 my review,"
​Hey everyone, let's dive right inn, I wanted to share my thoughts on a fragrance I picked up last year: Rayhaan Pacific. This fragrance launched in 2024 and I snagged it for an absolute steal at just ₹1399 from a reseller. A year later, and I can confidently say it's some of the best money I've ever spent on a scent as a beginner ofcourse 


​What Does It Smell Like?

​When I first sprayed it, it was a a vibrant, unapologetic blast of fruit🍊🍋🌿—a juicy, almost intoxicating mix of citrus, I gave it a week or two to macerate, and now it's a beautifully balanced, fresh, and juicy scent that’s perfect for summer. It’s not your typical aquatic freshness, but more of a vibrant, fruity freshness that’s addictive

​When Do I Wear It?

​This is my go-to for summer evenings🌆 Whether I'm meeting friends for coffee, grabbing a drink, or even hitting the clubs

​Why It's Not a Gym Scent? According to me

​I've seen some people categorize fresh scents for the gym, but I disagree for this one. Rayhaan Pacific is too juicy and attractive to be just a workout scent. It's more of a ""going out and getting noticed"" fragrance than a ""sweat it out"" one atleast for me!!!!!!

​That Time It Got Me Compliments😳😁

​I once wore this on a clubbing night out in SOBO. I was feeling extra confident and went a little heavy, maybe 15 sprays. The compliments started rolling in, and not just from my friends! A beautiful woman I was chatting with at the bar complimented it, and even a couple of people in a group behind us asked what I was wearing. The scent clearly projects and makes an impression.

​Performance 💪🏻

​The longevity is solid, easily giving me 6 hours of wear. It projects beautifully for the first hour and a half, creating a nice scent bubble around you. So yes it does a good job

​The Price Justifies Everything

​I recently saw Rayhaan Pacific Aura, which has similar notes according to Fragrantica( ofcourse better but similar ), going for around ₹2200.I still saw this bottle of Pacific was just ₹1450 on some resellers, and for that price, the performance is great

​What are your thought(s)? And what do you think I should try next?
Thank you for reading

Portland had that bright, unforgiving sun that makes every storefront look like a mirage, and this one smelled like lavender and old paper. A bell on the door laughed at me when I pushed it open. The woman behind the counter—gray braids, cardigan older than my lease—didn’t ask what I needed. She just slid a tiny amber bottle across the wood like she had been holding it for me all morning.

“Two drops,” she said, tapping the handwritten tag: *Dream Deep.* “Let go of what’s not yours.”

I nearly joked that what wasn’t mine lately was sleep. Instead, I paid, tucked it in my pocket, and walked home with the sun on my back and the words *let go* softening places I didn’t know were clenched.

My apartment was its usual quiet: the fan’s low hum, the stack of half-folded clothes, a paperback stuck open on a sentence that never learned how to end. I set the bottle on the nightstand, next to the glass of water I never finished. The dropper clicked once against glass—like a key against a lock.

Two drops. Bitter. Herbal. A promise on the tongue.

Dark. Fan. Breath.

And then—her.

Bare feet on warm wood, air like a held note. I was walking down a hallway I didn’t recognize but somehow remembered. A door waited open to a bedroom washed in pale greens, the kind that make you whisper. A vanity, a few glass bottles catching light. A closet swaying like it had its own slow heartbeat. I reached for a satin robe—my hands smaller than they should be—and when I looked up, the mirror did not argue.

It was my face, only… unburdened. A softness I’d never allowed. Full lips I didn’t hide with a pressed mouth. The shock wasn’t how different I looked. It was how much I recognized myself.

I smiled first. Then I gasped awake.

The bottle sat there, innocent. The fan, loyal. But my pillow was damp, and my skin felt like fabric had just told it a secret. I touched my cheek. I said nothing. I didn’t tell Leena, who was building a tiny coffee catastrophe in the kitchen, spilling grounds like constellations. When she asked if I slept, I said “Yeah,” like a lie that really wanted to be true.

That night, I tried again. Two drops. Hallway. The robe waited like it had memory. I sat at the vanity and brushed hair long enough to tuck behind my ear without thinking. It didn’t feel like pretending. It felt like remembering how.

This time, though, the girl in the glass looked up and didn’t look *through* me. She looked *at* me.

I woke with lips that felt kissed or painted—I couldn’t decide which scared me more.

By the third morning, my voice carried a softness you only hear when someone stops bracing for impact. “Coffee,” I whispered to the empty room, and it sounded like me the way a song still sounds like itself when someone finally sings it slowly.

I reached for a cardigan I’d once bought and then buried in the closet because it fit too honestly. It draped right. It said nothing and everything. Leena looked up from her art book and tilted her head.

“That’s new,” she said, like spotting a rainbow smear in an oil slick. She didn’t tease. She watched. I loved her for that.

The dreams kept arriving, deeper each night, as if some part of me had discovered a door and refused to unlearn it. I started keeping a notebook by the bed—my handwriting leaned a little, like even letters felt lighter. I wrote what she wore: pale pink blouses, soft gray skirts, the way a necklace rests when your shoulders finally drop. I wrote without thinking and read it back without understanding where the voice had been hiding.

One night, she stood at the closet and asked me a question in the kind of whisper that doesn’t fade when you open your eyes: *What’s my name?*

I woke with the pen already in my hand, ink warm, the page waiting—and watched myself write **Nora**. My throat burned in that grateful way that doesn’t ask permission. I whispered it once to be sure it fit. **Nora.** It settled into my chest like a key finding the bottom of a lock and turning.

The next morning, I put on a navy blouse with the little pleats I never let myself wear outside. I told myself I’d change before the mirror found me. I didn’t. I stood there and saw posture I’d never earned before—shoulders that weren’t apologizing. I panicked anyway. Hoodie. Jeans. Hair back. Pretend today is the same as yesterday.

I lasted an hour.

By evening, the closet had a chair wedged under its handle like I could keep dreams from traveling. I took the drops anyway. In the dream, she tapped the other side of the door with one fingertip. “You’re the one who opened it,” she said. When I woke, the chair was still there, but the blouse was on me—tucked, buttoned, gentle. I didn’t remember dressing. I only remembered relief.

Leena didn’t pry. She brewed tea like a slow ritual and asked if the dreams were still the same. “Not the same,” I said. “Truer.” She slid my fountain pen across the table like returning a compass. “Write it in your own handwriting,” she told me, eyes soft, like she’d been practicing that line for weeks.

When I finally told her the name, she smiled the kind of smile you use when something clicks into place that you’ve already believed. “I thought so,” she said. “You’ve felt like a Nora lately.”

The night after that, there wasn’t a hallway. There was only the room—candles, breeze, the clean hush after a summer storm—and the sense that I was not visiting anymore. I told her, “I think I live here now.” Mirror-me didn’t argue. She climbed onto the bed, close enough that I could see my own breath in her eyes. “You’ve always lived here,” she said. “You just never had the key.”

I asked the question that made me ache: *What if I forget? What if I wake up and lose you again?*

“You don’t have to find me anymore,” she said. “I don’t want to leave. Let me stay.”

So I said yes.

Morning light was tender on the blinds. My candle had burned down to a soft ring of lavender, wax like a tiny shoreline. In the notebook—in my own loopy, certain letters—I had written two quiet words while asleep: **She stayed.**

I didn’t reach for the mirror. I didn’t need proof. I made tea. I put on the cream blouse that smells like drawers you open carefully. The gray skirt that moves when I do. Lip balm with a whisper of color. I stepped into the kitchen without shrinking. Leena looked up and asked in a voice that knew the answer, “Is this… her?”

“No,” I said, steady in a way I will never forget. “It’s me.”

Outside, the city wasn’t any kinder or crueler. That’s the strange part—when you change, the street doesn’t move to give you space; you learn how to take it. The barista wrote “Nora” on a cup like it wasn’t an earthquake. A stranger’s second glance didn’t feel like a verdict, just a glance. In the café bathroom’s awful fluorescent light, I met my own eyes and didn’t negotiate terms. I washed my hands and smiled like we’d agreed on something that had been true for years.

In little ways, the world adjusted its focus. Clothes I’d buried in the back of the closet found their way forward, as if gravity worked differently for softness. That night, I took the bottle out of habit and then set it down. The drops tasted less like medicine and more like permission—but I noticed something I hadn’t before: I didn’t *need* them. I was already where they had been taking me.

Leena left a note on the table, the ink a little too eager from the pen. *Let the dream stay awake*, it said, like a dare I had already accepted. I walked to the open closet—no chair against the door, no apology on the hinges. I chose joy on purpose: a pink blouse that felt like morning, leggings that didn’t fight me, silver hoops that rang a tiny bell every time I laughed.

There are questions I still can’t answer neatly, and maybe that’s the point. Was it the herbs? A spell? A story my body had been writing in the margins while I pretended to read the main text? Sometimes transformation feels like a staircase you think you’re climbing only to realize you were actually taking the elevator the whole time. Other days it is the simplest math: two drops + one name = a life you can finally breathe inside.

I don’t pretend the hard parts don’t exist. Some mornings I wake and reach for the old voice like an old sweater and feel the itch right away. Some afternoons I catch a reflection in a window and flinch out of habit before I realize the flinch isn’t needed. I’m still learning where to put my hands when I stand in line. I’m still learning how to let my shoulders be pretty, not small. But “still learning” sounds like living, and I think that’s what I missed most.

If you’ve ever worn a hoodie like armor or swallowed your voice to make a room quieter, you probably know what it means to fear your mirror. I did. I do, sometimes. But there’s a moment I keep in my back pocket for the shaky days: the first time someone said “Morning, Nora” in daylight, and I didn’t correct them. It was a tiny thing that rearranged all the big ones. It told me I didn’t have to argue with my own name anymore.

Tonight, the bottle is back on the nightstand. It’s just glass and light now, a souvenir from a journey that turned out to be a return. I’ll keep it for what it taught me: that I wasn’t broken, only waiting. That doors open from the inside. That sometimes “let go of what’s not yours” means loosening your grip on a life that made you small, even if that life looked fine on paper.

I don’t know if I’ll dream the hallway again. I don’t have to. The room is here. The mirror is kind. The voice is warm. The name fits.

I am not visiting anymore.

However, I’ve come to hit a plateau. September 1st I was 154.6 and I’ve only lost 2 ounces. I’ve tried raising my calories to 1400 for like 5 days to see if maybe that would help, it only brought me back up to 156.2 so I quickly dropped my calories again to 1250. I’ve been eating around 1250-1350 now. I’m also 5’2 and I do 1 hour of cardio everyday. I also weigh my food everyday, even my coffee! 

I also want to mention that since August 12 I’ve had only 2 days where I ate 1800 calories and that is considered maintenance or maybe slightly above it. I don’t eat out at all and cook from home everyday. 

Please lmk if you know why this is happening… I started out walking 30 mins a day in August and I did increase my cardio since the plateau and nothing is happening. I know I have lost 6lbs since August 12 which I think is great, just sucks that the scale hast moved for a while. I know I still have until October 12 for it to be considered another full month of my weight loss journey so I really really hope my scale can drop at least 3lbs or so.

That 1 AM quick fix, where you hack together a function that does *everything,* processes the order, swipes the card, blasts out an email, and magically updates inventory all in one glorious mess. 

Feels like a win in the moment, right? Coffee in hand, deploy button smashed. 

Fast-forward six months: shit hits the fan, you're knee-deep in bugs, and you're wondering why the hell your payment gateway change broke the whole damn shipment pipeline. 

Because your code's a house of cards, not a fortress.

I've lost count of the times I've inherited codebases like this. The kind where one function is basically a novella, 200 lines of if-else spaghetti that touches every corner of the app. It's a suicide pact with your sanity.

Enter the **One-Job Rule**: Every function gets *one* clear job. Period. No side hustles.

**The Nightmare Example (We've All Written This Beast):**

processOrder() – the monolith monster:

* Grabs the order details
* Runs the card charge (fingers crossed)
* Fires off that confirmation email
* Tweaks the inventory count

Tweak the payment logic? Boom, emails stop sending, inventory ghosts out. It's like changing one lightbulb and accidentally setting your house on fire.

**The Hero Fix (Split It Up, Sleep Better):**

Break it into specialists:

* takeOrder() – just handles the intake, clean and simple.
* chargeCard() – payments only, swap providers without drama.
* sendConfEmail() – emails? That's its world.
* updateInventory() – stock tweaks, isolated AF.

Why is this a game-changer? Let's break it down, no BS:

1. **Debugging? Laughably Easy.** Email crapping out? Dive straight into sendConfEmail(). No hunting through a 500-line apocalypse.
2. **Scaling Without the Sweat.** New payment API? Update one function, test it solo, done. No rippling chaos across the app.
3. **Onboarding Newbies = Zero Headache.** Junior dev joins? They grok the code in an afternoon, not a month of ""WTF is this?"" meetings. Ship faster, hate less.

This is battle-tested. I refactored a legacy beast last year following this, and our deploy times dropped by half. No more midnight panics.

**Your 30-Second Challenge (Do It Now, I Dare You):**

Fire up your IDE. Pick *any* function staring back at you. Can you describe what it does without saying and? Like, It charges the card, not It charges the card and updates stock and emails the user and...

If 'and' sneaks in? Split that sucker. Right now. Your future self will high-five you (or at least not rage-quit).

Build code that grows with you, not a ticking time bomb waiting to explode. What's the worst monolithic function horror story you've got?",1,1758642997.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False
1nol7u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SustainableCocoa/comments/1nol7u3/breaking_eus_deforestation_law_eudr_faces/,🚨 BREAKING: EU’s deforestation law (EUDR) faces possible second delay,"https://preview.redd.it/870pdaigsxqf1.jpg?width=1054&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=71031f05b434dda4d07bfcbfddba545023810e4a

The European Commission is considering postponing the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) by another year — pushing its start date from **30 Dec 2025 to the end of 2026**.

This comes just a week after industry was told everything was on track. The issue? The **IT system** that underpins the law may not be able to cope with the sheer volume of transactions it needs to process.

📌 What’s at stake:

* The EUDR covers key commodities like **cocoa, coffee, palm oil, soy, beef, and timber**.
* Companies must submit **Due Diligence Statements (DDS)** proving their imports are deforestation-free.
* Without a robust IT platform, trade flows could face major disruption.

📌 Industry reactions:

* Sustainability execs warn that “moving goalposts” erode business confidence and risk undermining Europe’s credibility on climate and sustainability.
* German MEP Christine Schneider welcomed the delay but said it shows problems run deeper and need more than just transitional fixes.
* Others argue that constant delays hurt companies already investing millions to prepare.

📌 Why it matters for cocoa:

Cocoa is one of the sectors most directly affected. Exporters, processors, and chocolate makers have been racing to meet the EUDR’s traceability requirements — and another delay could mean both **breathing room** and **fresh uncertainty**.

At the time of writing, the Commission hasn’t officially confirmed the delay. But if adopted, this would be the **second consecutive 12-month pushback** to Europe’s flagship sustainability law.

👉 What do you think?

* Is a delay necessary to avoid chaos?
* Or does kicking the can down the road damage trust in EU sustainability policy?

They had responded on the post about “internal issues” that caused them to close; but suddenly have disabled comments on the IG post. Hoping someone who worked there can maybe shed some light.

It’s surprising since their food, baked goods, and coffee was great and all the times I’ve been, there have been a good amount of customers. I’m sad for the people who frequented that place because of the community it provided and you’re hard pressed to get quality stuff like that in the area. But I’m even more saddened by the amazing young staff I would see there regularly who now no longer have employment and maybe community. Not to mention exacerbating the problem of all these dying small towns nationwide.

Apparently the cafe was partly owned by Wild Roots Off Grid (YouTube), who also run their candle business out back. Looking at their posts they’ve just purchased an “island” up north (Canada?), and the timing of this closure seems suspect.",2,1758642941.0,WestVirginia,0,1.0,False

As LA28 prepares to welcome athletes and fans from around the globe, Starbucks will be there to support moments of connection and community through unique coffeehouse activations featuring Starbucks arabica coffee handcrafted by green apron partners.  

“As the Official Coffee Partner of the LA28 Games and Team USA, we are brewing more than great coffee - we are championing a global celebration. Core to our mission is a commitment to inspire and nurture the human spirit — one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time. Starbucks is proud to bring connection, culture, community and incredible coffee – to the world stage,” said **Tressie Lieberman, EVP and Global Chief Brand Officer of Starbucks Coffee Company.**  

As the Official Coffee Partner of LA28 and Team USA, Starbucks will be a part of numerous aspects of the Games in the U.S. In the Olympic and Paralympic Village, Starbucks plans to provide a specially designed coffeehouse to foster moments of connection and community, serving Starbucks coffee crafted by expert green apron partners to the thousands of athletes participating.   

Starbucks will also extend the cafe experience at competition venues, volunteer hubs, and many other places — serving coffee to Olympic and Paralympic athletes, fans and spectators.    

“This is our chance to co-create a Games that will resonate for generations to come, and welcoming Starbucks to the LA28 and Team USA family marks the coming together of a world-class brand and a globally embraced event, with a shared commitment to shaping culture and community,” said **LA28 Chairperson and President Casey Wasserman**.  ""This partnership will unite Starbucks deep connection with communities across the country with what will be one of the most iconic and powerful platforms in all of sports: the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games.”  

Starbucks will also partner with NBCUniversal to support the company’s multi-platform coverage of the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026 and the LA28 Games. As part of this partnership, Starbucks will have coffee exclusivity across NBCUniversal’s national Olympic and Paralympic coverage and access to premium storytelling opportunities.    

“The Starbucks brand has long embodied community and inspiration, with products that have motivated and fueled the world. There is no better celebration to extend that mission than the Olympic and Paralympic Games,” said **Mark Marshall, Chairman, Global Advertising and Partnerships, NBCUniversal**. “We are honored to partner with Starbucks and their entire organization to showcase the incredible spirit and athleticism of Team USA across our extensive coverage of the Games.” 

Starbucks has been part of the fabric of the Greater Los Angeles community for nearly 35 years with more than 1,000 stores in the broader LA region. Beyond its coffeehouses, Starbucks continues to invest in the broader Los Angeles community through the Starbucks Foundation. In June 2025, The Starbucks Foundation awarded 45 [Neighborhood Grants](https://about.starbucks.com/neighborhood-grants/), totaling nearly $100,000, to Los Angeles organizations and in January 2025, The Starbucks Foundation contributed $1 million to support relief and recovery efforts in response to the Los Angeles wildfires.

I (23, F) have just recently graduated college and am stuck living at home until I can find a stable job. I don't want to be in this situation, my parents aren't abusive or anything like that, but I struggle with my mental health being around them. My Dad is (to put it lightly) a stubborn man and is obsessed with a certain orange man in office, and my Mom does not wish to discuss any family issues with me. I love them because they are my parents, but I have honestly lost any respect for them over the last 7 years.

Anyway, now for what happened 10 minutes ago. I don't have many friends near me as they are all off doing their big time jobs and living away from their family, so I felt the urge to vent here. I went downstairs to put some things into my purse hanging in the mudroom and I pass up my dad sitting on the couch watching the orange man speak about something on TV. I almost always have my AirPods in listening to Smosh or something happy most of the time to block out the politics he is pretty much constantly watching, so I didn't hear him the first couple of times he said, ""hey."" I saw he was trying to say something to me so I paused my video and took out an AirPod. He didn't say anything and just stared at me with a mild smile and I was confused so I said, ""yeah?"" with a sarcastic smile in response to show him how I interpreted his expression. He said in response, ""That looks better, you look so much nicer with a smile.""

I was shocked to say the least, and wasn't sure if he was serious or not so I asked him, ""Why should I smile when I don't feel like smiling?"" He replied saying ""It is a universal point that people look better when they smile""

I felt like I was getting cat called in my own home by my freaking Dad. I gave him a slight benefit of the doubt and assumed maybe he didn't know the real impact of his words, so I explained to him that telling a woman to smile in any scenario is like cat calling and that I hate it when men do that to me in public and I really don't need to be told to smile, especially when I don't feel like it.

For some perspective, this was at 10am, and since I can work from home, I had just stepped away from my computer to go downstairs and grab a coffee or something, so I really had no reason to smile in my mind.

My Dad was getting annoyed with my response and started to argue back to me saying, ""Why would you not feel like smiling?"" I responded saying that, ""I am not happy so I am not smiling.""

I felt like I was arguing with a child at that point, so I told him, ""I'm not smiling for anyone but myself, and I certainly don't feel like smiling now."" and went back to my room where I am typing out this novel of a reddit post. Honestly this is more typing than I have ever done since college.

I don't know how to even address this or if I should. My Mom is working from home as well in her office and I am certain she heard the whole ordeal.

Simply put, I need to move out. Unfortunately, the job market is trash, LinkedIn is a scam, and finding any affordable housing is ridiculous. I know this whole thing is very ""first world problems"" but I wanted to get this off my chest and ask if anyone knows the best steps to take to move out or what I should do to keep myself sane enough until I can move out.

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one!",0,1758642673.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.5,False
1nol2y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/celpipAmigo/comments/1nol2y8/ways_to_practice_celpip_speaking/,Ways to Practice CELPIP Speaking,"Preparing for CELPIP Speaking isn’t just about knowing the format — it’s about daily practice and simulating the *real test*. Here are methods that worked for me (with examples):

**✅ My Practice Methods:**

* **Speak every day in English** Example: I ordered coffee in English every morning — “Could I get a medium latte with oat milk, please?” It felt awkward at first, but later it became automatic.
* **Record yourself** Example: I answered a Task 1 prompt (*“Give advice to a friend moving to another city”*) into my phone, then listened back. I caught myself saying “umm” too often and tried again until I sounded smoother.
* **Use personal stories** Example: For Task 2 (*Describe a personal experience*), I talked about my first day at work. Since it was real, I had natural details to add, like “I got lost in the office and had to ask for help.”
* **Try frameworks like PREP (Point-Reason-Example-Point)** Example: For Task 5 (*Express an opinion*), I said: *“I think working from home is better (Point). It saves commuting time (Reason). For example, I used to spend two hours in traffic (Example). That’s why I prefer remote work (Point).”*
* **Expand vocabulary** Example: Instead of “happy,” I practised words like “thrilled,” “delighted,” “excited.” It made my answers more varied.
* **Simulate test conditions with mock test software** Example: I used CELPIP practice platforms with *timed mock tests*. This helped me get used to the 30-second prep + 60-second speaking limit. It felt almost like the real exam — much better than casual practice.
* **Use free CELPIP resources** Example: I joined official CELPIP webinars. One task was: *“Your neighbour’s dog is barking at night. What do you say?”* Practising in that structured setting gave me confidence.

**🎯 What I Learned:**  
Real progress came when I combined **daily speaking** with **mock tests under exam conditions**. Recording myself and timing responses made me much more confident on test day.",1,1758642668.0,celpipAmigo,0,1.0,False

It was really great and I felt very secure and I thought he had felt the same. That was until he told me that he just recently came off of a relationship (1.5 months ago). This was around 4 weeks in and I told him to make a choice to continue to date or end it there if he needed the space. The thing was, we did mutually agree to end it and (ugh it's my fault) we ended up grabbing coffee a few days later and he held my hand and you know where this goes. 

  
The thing is, I think I was falling deeper, until I really had to be sure of where he was. So I asked again for a final answer if he really wanted to go through with this. He said he did, but really thought he needed a bit more time to grow. My heart shattered. I asked that hoping he'd go through with me. After that night, I tried my best to really move on since I think I'm the one who fell harder. I deleted linked playlists, hid stories, etc. 

  
Now the thing annoying me now is that he's been messaging me as if nothing happened. He even sends voice notes sounding all happy and normal while I'm bawling my eyes out every other hour. I can't believe he thinks everything can go back to being the same as friends. Is that a thing? Like some people just naturally move on so quick things can go back to normal? Should I be trying to match that? 

  
Our friends have a group picnic in the coming days and he's there. Personally I dont want to go, but if it might help me move on, should I?

Chapter 1

POV Jocelyn

“Shit, shit, SHIT—”

The words tear from my throat like a battle cry. My heel catches the elevator threshold like it’s personally offended by my existence.

I’m airborne for exactly two seconds. Papers explode from my death grip like the world’s saddest confetti. My coffee launches across pristine marble flooring that probably costs more per square foot than I make in a month.

My dignity? Already dead and buried six feet under.

I hit that floor like a meteor strike, and somewhere in the distance, I swear I hear the universe laughing.

“Smooth, Jocelyn. Real fucking smooth.”

I’m scrambling on hands and knees, chasing scattered documents across marble that’s so polished I can see my own mortified expression reflected back at me.

This is it. This is how I lose the only job that could save Mia’s life—face-first on the 43rd floor of some corporate palace that screams money and intimidation from every surface.

“Ma’am, are you—”

“I’m fine!” The words snap out harder than I intended, but panic makes me sharp-edged.

The secretary behind the massive desk looks like she’d rather call security than acknowledge my existence. Her nameplate gleams in gold letters: Patricia.

“Just… me versus physics. Physics won, I guess.” I’m hauling myself upright, while my hands won’t stop shaking, and it has nothing to do with the fall.

Twenty-six hours at the hospital watching your six-year-old fight cancer will do that to you. Sleep becomes optional when your kid’s life hangs in the balance.

Patricia’s mouth twists like she’s tasting something particularly unpleasant. “Mr. Wolfe doesn’t tolerate—”

“Disruptions. Crystal clear.” I straighten up, trying to look like a functioning adult instead of a tornado survivor.

The mantra starts looping in my head like a broken record: *‘Don’t mess this up, Jocelyn. You can’t afford to.’*

Triple salary.

The words dance in my vision like a mirage.

Enough for Mia’s treatment. Enough for the experimental therapy her doctors mentioned in hushed tones. Enough to maybe—*maybe*—keep my baby alive and healthy.

If I don’t faceplant again in the next five minutes.

“You’re the new assistant?” Patricia’s voice could freeze hell over and charge admission.

“That’s me. Professional disaster, at your service.” The sarcasm slips out before I can stop it, but I’m past caring.

A door *slams* behind Patricia’s desk, and the sound ricochets through the space like a gunshot.

Then *he* walks out, like he owns the world.

Broad shoulders that strain against a charcoal suit, sleeves rolled up to reveal forearms that should be illegal. Hair that’s somewhere between gold and ash, perfectly tousled in that way that takes either professional styling or incredible genetics.

Phone pressed to his ear, voice cutting through the air like a blade: “I don’t give a damn what Shanghai thinks. Fire them. All of them. I want new contractors by morning.”

Then he turns and those eyes hit me like a freight train carrying a cargo load of holy shit.

Green like sea surface, like emeralds, like every cliché poets use when they’re trying to describe something indescribable. They’re sharp enough to cut glass and focused enough to dissect my soul in under three seconds.

Jesus Christ, he's beautiful in that dangerous, untouchable way that makes smart girls do monumentally stupid things.

There's something about him. Something that pulls at the edges of my memory like a half-forgotten dream. I know this face or maybe I've imagined it a thousand times.

The way he carries himself, that particular tilt of his head, even his presence feels achingly familiar.

The recognition hits like déjà vu mixed with pure, undiluted want.

“You’re late.” He ends his call with military precision, sliding the phone into his pocket without breaking eye contact.

“Sorry, traffic was—”

“I don’t want excuses. I want results and discipline.”

His voice hits different. Low, commanding, with an undertone that sends weird shivers down my spine for reasons I absolutely cannot and will not analyze right now.

“Right. Results and discipline. Got it.” My own voice sounds foreign, breathless in a way that makes me want to kick myself.

He’s already moving, all purpose and controlled energy. “Conference room. Cunningham files. Twenty minutes.”

“Which Cunningham files?”

He stops. Pivots. Those green eyes narrow to laser points that could probably bore holes through steel.

“The ones you should have reviewed instead of whatever kept you looking like you went ten rounds with a blender and lost spectacularly.”

Ouch. Direct hit to the ego.

“I was at the hospital—”

“Personal problems stay personal. This is business.”

Cold bastard. Beautiful, intimidating, completely heartless bastard.

The next eight hours are psychological torture disguised as employment.

Every order delivered like I’m an incompetent child who can’t be trusted with safety scissors. He criticizes my filing system, my coffee-making skills, my ability to transfer calls without hanging up on people.

Nothing I do meets his standards, which apparently exist somewhere in the stratosphere.

But I need this job. Mia needs this job.

So I swallow my pride, along with several creative profanities, and do whatever Zayden Wolfe demands. Even when my body keeps freaking out around him.

Something about him sets my nerves on fire, but I can’t figure out why.

Maybe it’s just intimidation. Rich, powerful men have that effect, right? The whole alpha predator thing that makes normal humans want to either flee or submit. Basic biology. Except it doesn’t feel basic. It feels complicated and messy and terrifying.

At exactly five o’clock, I bolt from that building like it’s on fire and I’m the last person to notice.

Straight to the hospital. Straight to Mia. Straight to the only thing that matters.

She’s awake when I slip into her room, dark curls spread across the pillow like a halo. Those huge light-green eyes, that came from someone I try very hard not to think about, light up when she sees me.

“Mama! Look what I drew!”

Another tiger. Always tigers.

This one is orange and black, with fierce eyes and powerful paws. She’s been drawing them for months now, ever since she started the new treatment. Tigers in every possible configuration—sleeping tigers, prowling tigers, tigers with cubs.

“Why tigers, baby?”

She considers this with the seriousness that only six-year-olds can muster. “Because they’re brave and strong. Like my daddy would be if I had one.”

My heart cracks clean in half. “Mia, sweetheart…”

“I know I don’t have a daddy. That’s okay, Mama. But sometimes I pretend he’d be like a tiger. Powerful and protective. He’d fight the bad things and keep us safe.”

My hand moves to the birthmark on my collarbone without conscious thought. Hidden beneath my collar, where no one can see, that heart-shapet spot that’s been there since birth.

Seven years ago. A masquerade gala I had no desire to attend at first. Champagne and masks and a stranger who made me feel alive in ways I didn’t know were possible.

Eyes that burned like fire. Hands that worshipped every inch of my skin like I was something precious. A voice that whispered praises like a prayer while he traced that birthmark with his tongue, calling it a lucky charm.

I ran before he could wake. Before I could fall harder. Before I could tell him he’d changed my life forever in ways he’d never know.

Somewhere in this city, that stranger is living his life—successful, powerful, probably married with a perfect family—while his daughter draws tigers and dreams of having a father strong enough to save her.

He has no idea she exists. No idea she’s fighting for her life. No idea that every day she slips a little further away while he makes million-dollar deals and lives his perfect life.

The stranger who gave me the most beautiful thing in my world.

The stranger who never knew he had a daughter.",1,1758642353.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

I do find mature women pretty attractive although I've never been in a relationship with one.

I told her I’m about to do the Park Run and that I’ve lost about 6 stone in weight over the past few years (maybe that came off as bragging, idk) and she congratulated me.

Please read.

I want you to hold me so badly. I want to hold you so badly. I want to kiss you everywhere and take all this pain we both feel away. I want to rub my hands down the back of your neck when you’re driving us to get coffee and have you glance over with love and put your hand on my leg. The thought of never having that again, with you, kills me. I don’t want anyone else.

I want you, I told your dad to have you call me. I told him we weren’t ready for divorce. He was adamant that you wanted that. And I sobbed and said I’m not ready to lose him. He replied “I better get ready, that you sounded better than you have in a long time”How could the man who begged me to stay the night before be the same one who let go?

I don’t see how this could possibly be true. I tried to open up,  talked with him and was so kind and soft. I explained like we had talked about me doing so many times, like I expected, I was met with cruel cold responses. I waited and waited and my heart shattered as reality set in.

How could you give up on us when I stood by you through your darkness and pain? How could you give up and walk away when I needed you the most? How could you rationalize or even make the decision in such an emotional moment. You left me, again. When I needed you to show up. You shutdown and abandoned me. I don’t know if I’ll ever be ok. I don’t know if I can ever recover from this pain. I’m here alone, picking up the pieces of the mess you left behind.

This was a choice you made, and you chose to walk away from someone who held you thru every mistake and pain you had endured or put onto others. I told you I forgave you for the mistakes you made in rage, I told you to forgive yourself. Seeing you struggle with who you were becoming was equally as painful as experiencing your hurtful actions and words.

This is all so wrong and not the way things should have gone. We owed more to ourselves, our marriage, our son. I don’t know what I could ever say to make you see that, I truly feel I did everything I could.

I sobbed and called out to you. I wish you would have just called me.

I want to lay my head on your chest and feel your heartbeat like I’ve done so many times before. Listening to it slowly to see if it matches mine, it does. We fit. We always have and always will. You’re fucking perfect.

I’ve been doing work in counseling and I see some of my patterns now: when I feel alone I internalize it, panic, overthink, and sometimes make things worse. This summer I needed you so badly. When you pulled back because you were tired or stressed, I felt rejected — small and unwanted — and I’m sorry for how I reacted. All I wanted was to feel heard and to not be alone.

I needed you. I want you. And I don’t want to keep repeating those old cycles. I can hold space for you when life is hard — please let me hold your hand through it instead of walking away.

I’m in the market for a used Cayenne and I’ve narrowed it down to either the 2021 Base or the 2021 E-Hybrid. My budget is around $45k-$50k, and here’s what I’m looking for:

Quiet and comfortable (I don’t need to hear every pebble on the road… unless it’s in surround sound).

A little sporty (enough to feel special, not trying to race GT3s at Cars & Coffee).

Good reliability (I’d like to drive the car, not fund my mechanic’s next vacation).


So here’s what I’d love to know from actual owners:

Between Base and E-Hybrid, which better matches my goals?

What options/packages should I absolutely look for (air suspension? Premium Plus? smaller wheels?)

What pitfalls or issues should I avoid (transfer case? hybrid quirks? infotainment gremlins?)

Anything that’s a “don’t touch it unless you enjoy suffering” level of bad?


I know both trims have their fans, but I want real-world feedback from those of you who live with them daily. Any must-have advice before I sign away $45k and my sanity?

1nokuuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1nokuuf/vyvanse_gut_check/,Vyvanse gut check,"Hi! I was finally diagnosed last week and started 30mg vyvanse last Thursday. Here’s what I’ve experienced since:

- Thursday: picked up my prescription in the AM and took first pill around 9:30am. Had two McDonald’s sandwiches for breakfast, v carby. I can’t remember my caffeine intake this day. Meds gave me a total 180. I was SO motivated and energetic and my brain was quiet and focused. Unmedicated, I’d get maybe one really good brain and body day every few months and I’d crash partway through the day. This felt like one of the best days with the added bonus of not crashing. I had also had noticeable appetite suppression and dry mouth. Around mid-afternoon, I began to wonder if I overshot the target and needed a smaller dose, as I was bordering on euphoria. I had trouble falling asleep that night, which is not like me. 

- Friday: take everything from Thursday and adjust it down a notch. Took pill at around 7:30am with a Greek yogurt and granola breakfast. Had my coffee around 8:00-8:30am, which was a latte with 2oz cold brew concentrate (as opposed to my standard 5oz). Still all of the benefits, the dry mouth, and the appetite suppression but I didn’t hit that near-euphoric feeling. Still have lots of trouble falling asleep.

- Saturday and Sunday: no meds! Soooo tired on Saturday but not in a way that was abnormal for me. This felt like a totally normal weekend. No continued trouble sleeping. I actually slept almost ten hours Saturday night, which was incredible.  

- yesterday: took meds just after 7am on an empty stomach, then went about getting ready for work. Had a sausage and cheese muffin and dumped my 2oz of cold brew concentrate into half a protein shake for breakfast around 8:30ish. Felt so tired and spacey most of the day. I noticeably still had appetite suppression and a little bit of dry mouth. My brain was definitely quiet and I felt when the meds started kicking in around the two-hour mark, but instead of revving me up, it’s a little like I stalled out. This was a long day and I went to a concert in the evening and I still sustained energy for all of that, so I suppose that’s notable. No trouble sleeping this night, but of course, the physical exertion may have something to do with that. 

- today: took my meds with half a protein shake and water this morning around 7 before hopping in the shower. I didn’t have breakfast or coffee properly until nearly 9:30, so well after the meds kicked in. I didn’t necessarily “feel” them kick in today the way I did yesterday. Mostly, I feel exactly like I did unmedicated, which is spacey, fatigued, and having a terrible time focusing on anything.

I’ve read a ton here about people’s different experiences and tips and tricks, which is what led me to taking it earlier in the day when I had such trouble sleeping those first two night and making sure to have protein despite not historically being much a breakfast person in the first place. I did all that under the assumption that this week would feel like last week did and I’d need to learn to manage the impact, but that’s not what’s happened! 

My gut thought about the change this week is that I’ve just adjusted and need to titrate up. I have a follow up with my doc next Monday. Does my gut read sound right to yall? Am I missing any tips or tricks I should try between now and my follow up?",1,1758642161.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

To test my husband's work abilities, Dad arranged for me to conduct a surprise inspection of the company he manages.

Before anyone could stop her, she grabbed a contract off someone's desk and started feeding it in.

He wants to cosplay CEO while babysitting his pet disaster? Not on MY family's payroll!  
  
  
...  
  
  
Dad sent me to the company to evaluate Jaxon.  
  
  
He said it was routine inspection, told me not to stress about it—just think of it as getting familiar with the business early.  
  
  
I figured it was just going through the motions.  
  
  
So I told the receptionist I was an auditor from corporate, and she respectfully swiped me through with her keycard.  
  
  
But the second I entered the office area, I spotted this woman.  
  
  
She was dressed super innocent—white sundress from Target and everything—crouched in front of the paper shredder, looking totally fascinated.  
  
  
""OMG, this machine is like, totally insane. Can it literally shred anything?""  
  
  
Without thinking, she grabbed a document from the desk next to her.  
  
  
The cover was stamped in red letters: ""MERGER CONTRACT.""  
  
  
She didn't even hesitate—just started shoving the contract toward the shredder.  
  
  
A guy with glasses nearby went absolutely pale.  
  
  
He basically threw himself at her, nearly tackling her to snatch the contract away.  
  
  
""Holy shit, Wren! Weren't you supposed to be gaming in the office?""  
  
  
His voice was shaking with terror.  
  
  
""What are you doing out here? This contract goes to print this afternoon!""  
  
  
The woman got bumped by him but wasn't mad at all—just giggled and waved her empty Dunkin' cup around.  
  
  
""Gaming got boring. I'm literally dying of thirst.""  
  
  
The coworker let out a relieved breath, clutching that contract like his life depended on it.  
  
  
He lowered his voice, practically begging:  
  
  
""Then please, go grab some water and drink it back in the office, okay? Doesn't Jaxon's office have its own Keurig?""  
  
  
The woman pouted.  
  
  
""That coffee tastes nasty. I want some of that good stuff from the break room.""  
  
  
She totally ignored his about-to-cry expression and headed toward the kitchenette.  
  
  
Watching this whole trainwreck, my temples were pounding.  
  
  
I grabbed a young-looking intern nearby.  
  
  
""Who is she?""  
  
  
The intern glanced at me, then quickly looked back at the woman's retreating figure, eyes full of dread.  
  
  
He put his finger to his lips.  
  
  
""Shh, keep it down.""  
  
  
He leaned close to my ear, voice barely a whisper.  
  
  
""That's our boss Jaxon's wife, Wren.""  
  
  
My heart dropped, and suddenly all of Jaxon's weird behavior lately made perfect sense.  
  
  
The intern kept talking.  
  
  
""Word is she actually owns this company, so she's like, the real queen bee around here.""  
  
  
""You just start? You'll get used to it.""  
  
  
He sighed, his face showing the kind of bone-deep exhaustion that only comes from being put through hell.  
  
  
""Usually she just hangs in Jaxon's corner office, gaming and binge-watching Netflix. Doesn't really mess with us.""  
  
  
""Jaxon must be out at client meetings today, so nobody's babysitting her. That's why she's out here wrecking everything.""  
  
  
Listening to him, my head was buzzing.  
  
  
She's the boss's wife.  
  
  
Then what the hell am I?  
  
  
The intern noticed my expression and looked concerned.  
  
  
""You good? You look kinda rough.""  
  
  
I shook my head and forced a smile:  
  
  
""I'm fine, just... wow.""  
  
  
""Can't believe the company has people like that. Real eye-opener.""  
  
  
The intern shrugged with a bitter laugh.  
  
  
""You get used to it. At least she doesn't actually do anything major. We all just deal and pray she gets bored and goes back to her office.""  
  
  
I stayed quiet.  
  
  
Doesn't do anything major?  
  
  
That contract she almost shredded? That would've tanked a billion-dollar deal.  
  
  
Who's gonna eat those losses?  
  
  
I watched Wren bounce out of the kitchenette, literally skipping and humming some Taylor Swift song.  
  
  
I pulled out my phone, about to call Dad.  
  
  
But then I thought better of it and put it away.  
  
  
Just leaving now would let Jaxon off way too easy.  
  
  
Dad sent me here to evaluate his abilities.  
  
  
Looks like his abilities AND his character are completely fucked.  
  
  
I wanted to see just how far this company had gone down the drain under his management.  
  
  
I straightened my blazer and walked to reception.  
  
  
""Hi, I'm Brielle from corporate, here for project auditing.""  
  
  
""Could you set me up with a temporary workstation? Somewhere quiet would be perfect.""  
  
  
""Also, today's inspection is confidential—I'd prefer Mr. Jaxon doesn't know I was here.""  
  
  
The receptionist nodded respectfully.  
  
  
I found a corner desk and sat down, keeping an eye on Wren from across the room.  
  
  
She was studying the fire alarm with her fresh Starbucks, looking like she was seriously considering whether to yank that thing.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
Jaxon was MIA all morning.  
  
  
Wren must've gotten bored gaming in the executive suite.  
  
  
She wandered back out like she owned the place.  
  
  
First she'd mess with someone's design mockups they'd been working on all morning.  
  
  
Then she'd randomly hit keys on people's computers, screwing up their spreadsheets.  
  
  
Everyone was pissed but couldn't say shit—they'd just freeze when she got close, then frantically fix whatever she broke after she moved on.  
  
  
Then she drifted over to the water cooler.  
  
  
Probably thirsty again, she grabbed a paper cup to fill up.  
  
  
Whether she's just clumsy AF or doing it on purpose, I couldn't tell.  
  
  
Her hand jerked.  
  
  
A full cup of water went flying in a perfect arc, splashing all over the wall next to the cooler.  
  
  
Right where the main electrical panel was.  
  
  
There was this loud ""POP!"" with sparks shooting everywhere.  
  
  
Every light in the office died.  
  
  
All the computer monitors went black at once.  
  
  
A few seconds later, the whole place erupted with screams and ""WHAT THE FUCK!""  
  
  
""My code! I've been coding all morning! It's not saved!""  
  
  
""My Photoshop files! The client's been blowing up my phone and I was almost done!""  
  
  
""My quarterly reports! They're due at 2! I'm so screwed!""  
  
  
The IT manager came flying out of his office.  
  
  
He saw Wren standing there looking all innocent after causing this disaster, and his face went dark.  
  
  
His mouth opened and closed, fists clenched, but he swallowed whatever he was about to say.  
  
  
Wren actually spoke first, voice all whiny and victimized.  
  
  
""Ugh, what's happening?""  
  
  
""This electrical stuff is like, total garbage. A tiny bit of water and it breaks? Why does our company buy such cheap crap?""  
  
  
The nerve of this chick blaming everyone else was honestly next level.  
  
  
The facilities manager came rushing over.  
  
  
He looked at the smoking, fried electrical panel, then at Wren.  
  
  
Immediately switched to this pathetic ass-kissing mode.  
  
  
""Wren, you're not hurt, are you? Did the sparks scare you?""  
  
  
""This totally isn't your fault—the wiring's probably old. We'll get it fixed ASAP, install a new waterproof system!""  
  
  
""You go chill in the office, we'll handle all this.""  
  
  
Wren pouted, looking unsatisfied, but didn't push it. She headed back to Jaxon's corner office.  
  
  
The facilities guy finally wiped the sweat off his forehead and started barking orders at IT.  
  
  
When he walked past my temporary desk, I stopped him.  
  
  
""Does this kind of thing happen a lot?""  
  
  
The manager looked at me, recognized I was from corporate, and his expression went bitter.  
  
  
He pulled me into the stairwell and lowered his voice.  
  
  
""You're the auditor, right? I probably shouldn't be running my mouth, but after today...""  
  
  
He sighed heavily.  
  
  
""Real talk, she's Jaxon's princess. We can't touch her.""  
  
  
""Today Jaxon's in Chicago for client meetings, so nobody can babysit her.""  
  
  
""When Jaxon's around, at least he keeps her locked in his office playing mobile games...""  
  
  
His face showed pure defeat.  
  
  
""Last month, she had another 'oopsie'—knocked over her Frappuccino.""  
  
  
""It went straight into our main server.""  
  
  
""All our data got corrupted. IT pulled all-nighters for a week trying to recover everything. A whole week of everyone's work, completely trashed!""  
  
  
""What happened then?"" I asked.  
  
  
""Jaxon blamed IT for 'inadequate safety protocols' and docked everyone's quarterly bonuses.""  
  
  
""Said it would 'teach us responsibility.'""  
  
  
My stomach kept dropping.  
  
  
So, this is Jaxon's leadership style?  
  
  
Let some airhead wreck the company while hardworking people pay for her stupidity.  
  
  
Jaxon, you're really something special.  
  
  
Just then, the executive office door opened.  
  
  
Wren poked her head out and called to the dark office.  
  
  
""Ugh, I'm so bored! When's the WiFi coming back?... Oh no! My phone's at like 10%!... Are there any snacks in the break room?""  
  
  
Nobody answered.  
  
  
The entire office was dead silent, thick with frustration.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
IT had just gotten everything back online when Dad called.  
  
  
He needed me to pull some sensitive marketing data.  
  
  
Said the files were needed for this afternoon's board meeting at our Manhattan headquarters, and I had to handle it personally—zero margin for error.  
  
  
I grabbed a USB drive, downloaded the data from the marketing director's computer, and headed to the copy room.  
  
  
I'd just finished printing everything and was organizing it with binder clips when the copy room door swung open.  
  
  
Wren bounced in with a bubble tea from the place downstairs.  
  
  
Hell, she immediately spotted the heavy-duty stapler next to me and her eyes lit up.  
  
  
""Ooh, lemme borrow that real quick—my Hot Cheetos bag totally ripped.""  
  
  
She reached over like it was hers.  
  
  
I instinctively pulled the confidential documents and stapler away from her grabby hands.  
  
  
These files contained seriously classified intel.  
  
  
She whiffed completely, stumbled forward from the momentum, and tripped over the printer cord.  
  
  
Her boba tea went airborne.  
  
  
The brown liquid sailed in a perfect arc and splashed all over my freshly printed documents.  
  
  
A thick stack of corporate secrets instantly turned into a soggy, illegible mess.  
  
  
Staring at the destroyed files, I couldn't keep playing observer anymore.  
  
  
I looked up and locked eyes with her.  
  
  
Yet she had zero guilt on her face—actually looked pissed that I hadn't shared the stapler.  
  
  
My voice was ice cold.  
  
  
""You gonna take responsibility for trashing these documents?""  
  
  
Wren had probably never been called out by a company employee before.  
  
  
She blinked, confused.  
  
  
Then her face flushed red with anger.  
  
  
""Excuse me? How dare you talk to me like that?""  
  
  
""Do you have any idea who I am?""  
  
  
She straightened up, acting all high and mighty:  
  
  
""I'm Jaxon's wife!""  
  
  
Looking at her, I felt absolutely nothing—almost wanted to laugh.  
  
  
""Cool.""  
  
  
I replied flatly.  
  
  
""Does being Jaxon's wife give you license to destroy company property? To completely ignore workplace policies?""  
  
  
My pushback clearly threatened her little power trip.  
  
  
She lost her shit, pointing right in my face:  
  
  
""Um, yeah, it totally does!""  
  
  
""This whole company belongs to Jaxon, which means it's mine! I can do whatever the hell I want!""  
  
  
Her voice went full Karen mode, all screechy and entitled.  
  
  
""Who even are you? Some random new girl trying to school me?""  
  
  
Other employees came running when they heard yelling.  
  
  
Seeing this confrontation, they looked terrified.  
  
  
A few admin assistants kept tugging at my sleeve, silently begging me to apologize and back down.  
  
  
I didn't budge.  
  
  
I just stared her down.  
  
  
When I wouldn't cave, Wren felt humiliated in front of everyone.  
  
  
She whipped out her phone with this smug, vindictive smile.

I’ve realized that a lot of Cougar fans are very passionate, but haven’t been informed how they can help build the team through NIL. The goal of this, is to inform people about what their options are pertaining to WSU NIL. 

I understand a lot of people don’t like/ agree with it, but the reality is that it is the future and to be competitive we have to participate. If you have questions about how NIL works or why it is important please ask!

The Cougar Collective https://cougarcollective.org is where you can go for smaller dollar, subscription style donations. Or for the coffee, lager, seltzer, wine, and apparel options. All proceeds go to NIL! It starts at $18.90 per month (less than Netflix), and you get to pick where the money goes (a specific sport, specific player(s), etc). The goal of the Cougar Collective is ”Mighty by Many.” Aka, 20% of the 250,000 living alumni giving $18.90 per month. Small dollar at scale for sustainability. 

The second option is the WSU Foundation. This is designed for larger donations that are tax deductible. Similar to the Cougar Collective, you can be more specific (not as specific as the CC) about where your money goes and to what.

The third is CAF, which has been around for a while, to fund things like scholarships. 

We have been conditioned to believe that the big schools are paying upwards of $30MM in NIL for their roster. For about 95% of power 4 schools, this isn’t true. Most NIL pools are roughly $9MM-11MM in size, and mathematically, that’s exactly the ballpark we need to be in to field a playoff competitive team. This is well within reach if we get enough people at $18.90 per month. There is a major difference between football budget (facilities, uniforms, travel, equipment, staff, salaries) and NIL (paying players for their name, image, and likeness)! For the haters and the naysayers, this post is not to you, it is to the people that want to contribute to the future success of the program that haven’t been told how. We pay more for Netflix every month, if we want to be successful on the football field and get back into a power conference, we need to give the tools the team needs to be successful. We can 100% do this, we just have to want it.

This is likely a one time deal for us, so I want to make the most of it. We're going to some place (or places) in the circle on the photo provided next week. We want to pan sun up to sun down for two straight days, and try to strike a balance between actually finding gold, and the chance to find more than fly poop specks. 

I was thinking of starting in the South Yuba River Park area first, but I know a lot of these spots get hit a ton. We never have the chance to go to out of the way spots, so we're excited to be able to push the boundaries a little. 

If you're willing, please give me all of the advice to make the most of this trip? Areas to try, areas to avoid, must have tools, regulations to know, etc. 

I currently have pans, shovels, spades, a desert fox for cleaning out concentrates, sniffer bottles... what am I missing? (Also, considering a stream sluice... any recs? Does a stream sluice violate ""hands and pans""?)

Thank you all so much. Seriously appreciate this sub. 🙏🏻

I’ll be in your beautiful city soon for a few days with work (visiting from the UK). I’m staying in the Gaslamp area on Friday night before moving to a work hotel on Saturday for the following week (location TBC).

Before starting work, I’ve got the whole of Saturday 4th Oct free, day and evening, and I’m wondering what to do. I’ve been to SD before with work, explored downtown a bit, and spent a day in La Jolla. This time around I don’t have a specific checklist and don’t want to just aimlessly wander.

I’m thinking of hiring a car and driving up the coast for the day, stopping at various towns along the way to eat, grab coffee, people watch, and take some photos. I figure I could make it as far as San Clemente before heading back.

ChatGPT suggested this rough plan:

* 6:00am – Depart San Diego
* 6:30–7:30am – La Jolla
* 7:45–9:00am – Del Mar & Solana Beach
* 9:15–11:30am – Encinitas
* 1:30–3:00pm – Oceanside
* 3:30–5:30pm – San Clemente (optional)
* 5:45–7:00pm – Laguna Beach (stretch goal)
* 7:00–9:00pm – Drive back to SD & return car
* 9:00pm – Bars in Gaslamp

It looks a bit ambitious, so I’d love local advice on what’s worth keeping and what I can skip. I’m happy with a mix of walking around, grabbing good food and coffee, and soaking up the vibes — no need to tick tourist boxes.

(21M) I am a regular swimmer going to my local pool 6 days a week. When I was at the pool I would always see this other older guy swimming in the same lane as me, maybe late 50s or early 60s. It has been like this for months, but it was always awkward since we never spoke to each other and just smiled when we met. 

At the showers I would notice him staring my way and thought nothing of it. In the locker room a week ago I decided to break the ice so he didn't feel like I was ignoring him or avoiding a conversation. I asked him a simple question on his swim routine and workout and he was happy to talk (talked about hobbies and what we did on vacation) and complimented my technique.

He did most of the talking and would ask me questions about what I am studying and where I am from. I am 99% sure he is gay (the way he looks at me, LGBTQ flag on all of his swimming equipment, painted nails). 

He takes a really long time to shower and get dressed like almost an hour and I am not sure if he just takes his time or waits for me to finish my session since he comes out before me. We will talk in the locker room and say bye than I would see him outside the pool waiting around. 

He gave me a compliment as I was leaving saying that I look like a greek statue and look good. (I appreciated the compliment and said thanks but still found it a bit weird since this was right after I spoke to him for the first time.)

In truth he seems like a really nice guy and always pleasant to talk in regards to swimming and other small talk.

In our most recent swim he asked how old I was and I said 21. Later after our session he was waiting again at the exit of the swimming pool after we said bye in the locker room. He said he found something in his bag and offered me a chocolate bar or something like that. I said thanks and as we were leaving the pool to go our own separate way he asked me if he could ask something. I replied yes. 

He asked if I had time to grab a coffee or a drink and this sort of shook me a bit since this was the 4th time I saw him after speaking to him. I said that I will think about it and see if I have the time. 

I am really lost on what to do. I am not gay and also quite young for his age. He is a nice guy and I don't see any ill intent but I don't know how to tell him I am not interested since he goes to the pool almost every day with me and it might be a bit awkward after that.

Again, nice guy , good swimmer, no problem to talk to, but I would like to keep it like that.

I made sure to ask some simple questions to determine if our values and perspectives aligned. This helped me understand whether this person was right for me.  Answers weren't always immediate, but trusting my heart gave me peace and wisdom.
And yes, I allowed myself to be excited! When I was happy from within, that wave of happiness would draw me to subsequent encounters. The good conversations, the laughter, the little quirks all of them made my life more enjoyable. Whether the date went well or not, that joy always resonated with me.
And most importantly, I saw dates as a fun part of my life. My life was already complete. Even if a date didn't go well or didn't turn out the way I'd hoped, I was still just as wonderful.

today i was having a nightmare in which i had a baby with my ex (i don’t have children). i liked the feeling of having a baby and i loved her very much but even though i was happy, being with my ex again felt wrong, like i had a really dark shadow above me all the time. i woke up and i realized it was not real and could never be, so i felt relieved. 

in this dream i wake up and talk to my actual husband, who is getting ready to go to work (this happens everyday), but he’s wearing clothes he would NEVER wear. he asks me about what i think about his new outfit, we joke around about it and i finally tell him to go ahead if he likes it and wants a change of style. he goes to work dressed like this and i realize everything was a dream because he would never wear anything like that. i wake up again.

i start getting ready as usual (getting dressed, having breakfast, etc). when i go to the bathroom to brush my teeth i look at myself in the mirror and i see im wearing a yellow shirt I left in my parents’ house last time i went there. i _technically_ had put on a yellow top, not this yellow shirt. that triggers me so much because i realize i am dreaming again. i start screaming at myself in the mirror out of dispair, get close to my reflection so much i start seeing my eyes like in a magnifying mirror. i crack the toothbrush and throw it aggressively. i could _really_ feel myself cracking it like it was real life.

and then i wake up in real life, grab my phone and text my husband about this dream. he had just left and didn’t have the chance to read it because he forgot his coffee at home and he was coming back to get it (him leaving, me having the dreams and him coming back happened in like a 5 min bracket). it’s not like him to forget anything at home so i freaked out so much thinking it was happening _again_. when he came into the house i said his name out loud very scared and when he came to the bedroom to tell me he forgot his coffee i started crying and had an anxiety attack and feel derealized since then…

this isn’t the first time i experienced dreams like this. last time was like 2 months ago having a nap, and in my teen years it would happen from time to time mixed with sleep paralysis. it was terrifying.

I met him on the school trip by the end of May this year. We hit it off immediately. We spent 6 out of 10 days of that trip together. One whole day we were just the two of us in Barcelona, and that memory still feels so special to me. At night we would stay up talking and cuddling. Honestly, everything felt so magical, almost like a dream. My previous relationship was nothing like this, I had never felt the way I did with him.

Only three days after we met, he asked me to be his girlfriend, and I immediately said yes. We talked a lot, shared many interests, and he was funny, kind, respectful, and thoughtful. We spent most of the summer together, sharing everything with each other. At the beginning of August, I went on a trip with my friends, but the very next day my grandfather passed away. I was devastated and had to go back home. When I told him, he was so supportive and he even came to the funeral. Maybe that sounds like the bare minimum, but at that moment it meant so much to me.

Ten days later, I ended up in the hospital. They couldn’t figure out what was wrong, and I had to stay there for five days. He was really worried and checked up on me all the time. I did notice he wasn’t texting me as much as before, but I didn’t think much of it. The night I got discharged, he went out clubbing with his friends, got pretty drunk, and sent me more than 13 voice messages, each at least four minutes long, telling me how much he loved me and couldn’t wait to see me.

A few days later he came over and was so sweet. He brought me a teddy bear sprayed with his perfume. The next time we saw each other was on August 28th, our three-month anniversary, when we made clay figurines together. A few days later we went out again, but this time he was in a bad mood. We didn’t fight, but he was bothered that I wasn’t the one reaching out first, that I didn’t tell him much about my day, and that I rarely took the initiative to plan anything other than coffee dates. We ended up barely talking that night.

The next day we went out again, and the vibe was completely different we went shopping, and I felt like it really brought us closer. After that Monday, I didn’t see him again until Sunday. That week, he seemed a bit “dry” over text, but he kept mentioning how stressed he was with school, so I didn’t worry too much. On Saturday he didn’t text me at all, and later he said it was because he was waiting for me to text first, since it really bothered him that I thought I was annoying him. That turned into our “first fight,” but the next day we talked it through in person and agreed that we’re both similar in that way and should just try to relax and text each other more often.

That night he was more touchy than usual and tried to push some boundaries. I politely told him I wasn’t ready for that yet, and he respected it, saying, “Okay, at your pace.”

We met briefly again on Thursday, September 11. He was a bit irritated, not because of me, but because of some issues with organizing his and his friend’s joint birthday party the next day. He seemed down the whole time, but I didn’t push him and we just chatted casually. At the party, though, he was super clingy and affectionate, and I loved it. He told me so many sweet things like that he was lucky to have me and didn’t know what he’d do without me. I said the same back, and we just cuddled the whole night.

Our last “normal” date was Friday, September 19. He had just passed his driving test, he picked me up from school. But unexpectedly, our friends ‘18F’ and ‘18M’ joined us, which annoyed me because we had already planned to have a serious talk. That whole week he had barely texted, and I felt frustrated because I had been going through a lot but couldn’t share any of it with him.

That night turned out awkward. We drove to a lookout point, and while our friends spent most of the time kissing, he and I just lay there hugging and telling each other how much we missed each other. When he dropped me off, I told him honestly that it bothered me he brought our friends along instead of telling them he wanted time alone with me. All he said was, “Sorry, my bad.” Later that evening he texted me again to apologize, and I told him it was fine, but begged him to text me more often because he had become the most important person in my life and I wanted us to be able to share everything. He said he would, but also admitted that our dates were starting to frustrate him, since all we ever did was go for coffee. I told him I didn’t feel that way, that I enjoyed being with him anywhere. He said it wasn’t the same for him anymore, and that it was starting to push him away.

After that, we barely talked just a few messages about how stressed he was with school. Then yesterday, the 22nd, we went out because he said we needed to talk. Honestly, I thought we were just going to discuss everything from the past week, not break up. But right away, he told me he wanted to end things. I was shocked and didn’t know what to say. I asked if he was 100% sure, and he said yes. I begged him to stay and work on our relationship, our communication, our dates, but he just said he had lost his feelings and that it wasn’t the same anymore. I started crying. He hit me with the infamous line: “It’s not you, it’s me.” He said he didn’t want to stay together because he knew I’d try harder, but he couldn’t give the same back, and that would only frustrate him more.

When I asked if he had talked to anyone about it, he said he spoke with his parents, grandparents, and a few friends. Apparently, they all told him it was his decision to make.

He was so cold, and I couldn’t believe this was the same sweet guy I’d been with. I asked if he still would have broken up with me if we had gone out alone on Friday, and he said he didn’t know, that too much time had passed (two days!) and that he had been thinking a lot over the weekend. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I told him if that was really how he felt, then it was time to let go. He hugged me, and I cried even more. He asked if we could still stay on good terms because I was really important to him and he didn’t want us to end on bad ones.

I immediately called my best friend who was just as shocked as I was. She asked her boyfriend ,who’s also good friends with my ex what was going on. My ex told him he had simply lost feelings and wanted to focus on school since that was his top priority. Her boyfriend was surprised and said it was such a dumb decision, and that my ex would regret it soon. Another one of his friends also said he had made a big mistake and would regret it quickly.

Now I don’t know what to do. Everyone I’ve told is obviously biased and takes my side, saying it’s better that it ended, that he acted like a jerk, and that he doesn’t deserve me. But I’m still in shock and don’t know what to think. Like I mentioned, my previous boyfriend was awful and treated me horribly, he also broke up with me with the same excuse, saying things weren’t the same anymore and his feelings had faded.

So I keep wondering was my ex ever really in love with me? And if he was, was it real love, or was he just excited to finally have a girlfriend and put on all this effort to impress me? Did he break up with me simply because he felt pressured and thought our relationship was the source of that pressure? Part of me wants to believe he’ll come back, like everyone says he will, but I feel like if I keep holding onto that hope, it’ll never happen.",1,1758641004.0,Advice,4,1.0,False

If you've been to church, it's for learning about and worshiping God, not some aspiring megachurch pastor.

SPANISH WAS LEARNED BY MY MIL THROUGH A COLLEGE COURSE TO COMMUNICATE BETTER WITH HER HUSBAND. Most communication is done in English in the home! 

Well, there it is... this morning, I(25F) was making myself a coffee while my fiance, (35M) MIL (F58?), and our two kids (2F and 1M) were hanging out in the living room. Conversation all the sudden switched from english to spanish. I do not know Spanish, not well enough to really figure out anything of real substance. Let alone converse.

 My fiance's family is effectively bilingual and thats great, were even teaching our kids Spanish alongside English so that, they too can be bilingual. Im a SAHM so the teaching usually falls to me (the internet, really) and I've picked up bits here and there. 

Anywho, I picked out that MIL was telling my fiance about a specific christmas present for my daughter which is super cool. I just felt so weird knowing she was excluding me specifically (my daughter doesnt really register things yet) even if it was just about keeping a present a surprise.

 So I said something... I waited for a pause in the conversation and said ""hey, you know its considered rude to speak in another language in order to exclude the person who doesn't know it""

 To which, she responded ""i know, I was intentionally excluding you, it was about a present"" 

The confirmation bugged me. I just told her that I knew what she was talking about and pieced together what it was based off of what I did understand.

 Then they both SHUSHED me like somehow my daughter would miraculously understand what we were talking about.

 Maybe im just sensitive this morning but I havent really gotten along well with my MIL since we moved into her house a year and a half ago. 

My main fear is that she will become more and more comfortable speaking spanish in front of me. As this isn't the first time this has happened. Since I had a little understanding of the subject I felt it would be easier to bring up my discomfort with this instance than with a different one that I didnt figure out... because theres always the possibility its not about me.

 This time it was apparent. So thats why i went for it. I tried to say that its no different than the whole cliche nail salon situation which my MIL has complained to me about on NUMEROUS occasions. 

My fiance said NOTHING to back me up and just let me flounder...I will say, she did admit that she could've picked a better time to tell my fiance. 

Then after she left, he said I was the one being rude... I tried so hard to be really relaxed about it since the subject was so innocent, I am just not comfortable with the blatant exclusion when im RIGHT THERE! So, reddit, AITA?",1,1758640414.0,AmItheAsshole,57,0.52,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

You know, I was just thinking about my grandma’s house this morning. She had this dark, patterned linoleum in her kitchen, and I swear you could never see a single crumb. Our light wood floors now? It’s like a stage specifically designed to highlight every piece of dust, every stray cat hair. Sometimes I’ll sweep after lunch, turn around to put the kettle on, and glance back—it’s like a tiny, sad confetti party has already started. It’s that feeling of the finish line moving the second you think you’ve crossed it.



I used to think it was just me, or that I was a fundamentally messy person. Then I started noticing the tiny, constant sources. It’s not even about big messes; it’s the trail of coffee grounds from the machine, the crumbs from toast, the little bits of dirt we track in from the balcony. The pets, of course, are their own furry, shedding weather systems. The cleaning itself even contributes—dusting a shelf just pushes some particles into the air, and they gracefully float down to settle right back on the floor.



I remember complaining about this to a friend, and she just laughed. She said she’d had the same quiet frustration for years, feeling like a hamster onIn case anyone's wondering about the cost, this was the exact price I got. a wheel. Then she mentioned, almost as an aside, that her partner had gotten one of those little round robots as a birthday gift. She said it sounded silly at first, but the key wasn't some deep cleaning power.

[https://amzn.to/4nKKVAF](https://amzn.to/4nKKVAF)

The real shift, she explained, was the frequency. Instead of waiting for the visible buildup that made her feel behind, this thing just putters around for fifteen minutes a day, like a quiet little custodian. It’s not about a single, perfect clean. It’s about staying ahead of that daily drizzle of debris. It’s the difference between a weekly battle and a constant, gentle upkeep.



It clicked for me then. The goal isn't to win a war against dust, because dust is relentless. It's to manage the peace treaty. Now, that little hum in the background while I’m working is just a part of the day. Coming out to find clear floors in the morning, without having to lift a finger, feels less like a chore and more like a small, daily gift. It finally broke that cycle of cleaning just for the mess to immediately reappear.

But hear me out before you judge me.

My husband and I had been married for twelve years. Two kids, ages ten and eight. He worked construction during the day and security at night. Always tired. Always complaining about his back. Meanwhile, our neighbor moved in last year. Single guy, worked from home, always had time to chat when I was getting the mail.

It started innocent enough. He'd help carry groceries. Fix our fence. Little things my husband was too exhausted to do. Then one afternoon, while the kids were at school, he invited me over for coffee.

""Your husband's lucky,"" he said, pouring me a second cup. ""Beautiful wife, great kids.""

""He doesn't act like it,"" I said.

That was all it took. One thing led to another. Before I knew it, we were meeting every Tuesday and Thursday while my husband slept between shifts.

My mother knew. She caught us once when she came by unexpectedly. Instead of being shocked, she laughed.

""About time you had some fun,"" she said. ""Your father was the same way. All work, no play. Men need to learn we have needs too.""

She became my alibi. Covered for me when I needed to sneak out. Even started planting seeds of doubt in my husband's head when he got suspicious.

""She's been with me all afternoon,"" my mother would lie. ""You're working too much. Starting to imagine things.""

My husband started questioning himself. He'd apologize for being paranoid. Say he was just stressed from work. I'd comfort him, tell him everything was fine, then text my neighbor to meet me the next day.

This went on for months. My husband started seeing a therapist, convinced he was having anxiety issues. My mother and I would exchange looks across the dinner table, almost laughing at how easy it was.

Then my husband found something. A receipt from a hotel I'd claimed was a lunch with my sister. He confronted me, shaking, holding the paper.

""Just tell me the truth,"" he said. ""Please.""

My mother jumped in. ""She was with me that day. I remember clearly. You need to increase your therapy sessions.""

He looked between us, tears in his eyes. ""You're both lying.""

That night, he had what the doctors called a nervous breakdown. Ended up in the hospital for a week. While he was there, my mother suggested we move the joint savings to my personal account.

""Just for safety,"" she said. ""Men in his state of mind do crazy things with money.""

So I did. Forty thousand dollars. Everything we'd saved for the kids' college.

My husband came home to an empty bank account and divorce papers. He didn't fight it. Just packed a bag and left. The kids cried for weeks.

My neighbor and I dated openly after that. My mother babysat while we went on trips using the money my husband had saved. I posted photos on social media. Look how happy I was now. Living my best life.

But my neighbor got bored after six months. Found someone younger. Someone without kids and baggage.

I tried dating apps. Met a few guys. But single mom of two doesn't have the same appeal. My mother suggested I reach out to my ex, maybe reconcile. I laughed at her.

""After everything? He probably hates me.""

Turns out, hate wasn't the right word.

My ex had taken his breakdown and turned it into fuel. Started day trading with borrowed money. Studied markets obsessively. Within two years, he'd turned five thousand into two million. Bought a house in the nice part of town. Started his own investment firm.

The kids visited him every other weekend. Came back with new clothes, new gadgets, stories about his pool and game room. They started asking to live with him.

""Mom, dad's house is so cool,"" my daughter said. ""And his girlfriend is really nice.""

Girlfriend. The word stung more than I expected.

Then my son found my old phone. The one with all the texts. He's smart for a ten year old. Too smart. He showed his sister. They confronted me together, holding the phone like evidence.

""You lied about dad being crazy,"" my daughter said. ""You stole from us.""

They demanded to live with their father full time. The court agreed, especially after my ex's lawyer presented the text messages and bank records. I get supervised visits now. Two hours every Sunday at a community center.

My mother still defends me. Says I was just trying to be happy. But happiness doesn't pay rent. My ex stopped alimony after proving adultery. I work two jobs now, ironically. Cashier during the day, cleaning offices at night. Always tired. Always thinking about what I gave up.

Last week, I saw my ex at the store. New suit. New watch. His girlfriend's hand on his arm, diamond ring catching the light. He nodded politely and kept walking.

My mother says I should feel proud for pushing him to become successful. That without the breakdown, he'd still be working construction.

But I know the truth. I didn't push him to greatness. I pushed him away from me. And now I'm the one who's broken.

So Reddit, AITA for wondering if loyalty would have made me a millionaire's wife instead of a cashier living paycheck to paycheck?

1nojre9,https://i.redd.it/nbxtrrrqixqf1.jpeg,Aug 3-4,"As an Angeleno who’s logged way too many miles hiking the Hollywood Hills—from Runyon Canyon scrambles to the shady fire roads off Mulholland—I’ve gotta say, it’s a paradise for hikers but a total parking apocalypse. Street spots? Forget it, especially weekends or sunset hour. You’re basically funneled into those LA County lots like the one at Franklin’s Runyon trailhead or the Beachwood Drive overflow.

But man, this d4vd case is making those hills feel way more shadowy than usual. Reports say the singer’s black Tesla was abandoned around September 3, 2025, in the Hollywood Hills—towed from a spot near Doheny Drive and Bluebird Canyon after sitting for days. 

There was an early sighting as far back as August 5th (like this pinned spot near Laurel Canyon on the map below), that’s a solid 3-4 miles east through the twists—plenty of time for it to blend the car along brush before anyone notices. Check the screenshot: That circled Aug 5th car emoji is way over in Laurel Canyon/Trebek territory, while the red pin for 1300 Doheny Dr (the searched block) is clear across in the Bird Streets. Ditching something there? This is very important to know because the car was left there for a few weeks before it was moved a second and finally the third time before it was found.

Genius in the worst way—dense trees and thick chaparral swallow cars whole, hiker traffic sticks to paths (no one’s bushwhacking off-trail), and those $10M+ estates have folks gated up, not street-watching. It’s that perfect storm of escape and seclusion that hooks us for hikes… but damn, stories like this (tied to missing teen Celeste Rivas from ’24) hit different when you know the terrain. Stay vigilant out there, y’all—hike with a buddy.

I have lost so much sleep over this. I live here. I have a 12-year-old. We have a lot of people that rent out these houses through Airbnb for extended periods of time and you have young people influencers musicians DJs actors actresses, you name it— live out of his homes for a long time. And the fact that this little girl was wearing the same clothes for a year and a half, there is absolutely no way she was living in that house by herself. 

There’s a show called entourage from back in the day. The way that the boys lived is exactly the way LA life — is it hasn’t changed much.

So for context I turned 20 and for the past 2 years I’ve taken a break from school to focus on my mental health and work experience. Because I have a lot of mental health issues I’m working on. for once I came from a very mentally abusive and physically abusive childhood where the only thing I could do to save myself was to block out my emotions when I was younger but I did it so much it’s became a habit so nowadays I feel completely numb and only a few things can light that spark in my heart and my high school sweetheart was the one who first lit that flame.

In high school it was my senior year and I won’t lie I’ve dated around a bit so I had a few exes on campus but my school schedule was School one day and I had the next day off- so I was finally allowed to get a job and I took that chance as an excuse to get out the house so I was working 2 jobs. So I’d go to class one day and head to one of my jobs after class was over and the next day I would go to one job early I. The morning and go to the other one till late at night.

One night I was working at my second job as a host at a restaurant and then she came in (for the stake of the story and to keep her name a secret I’ll just call her something random like decaf) so decaf walks in and she is the most beautiful, Cute woman I’ve ever seen and her voice was just serine. but she was trying to apply to work there so I got a manager and just talked to her while we waited. Nothing flirty cause I’m on the clock lol but just I was happy listing to her voice. Manager comes out and says that there’s no open slots and she leaves so I thought wouldn’t see her again. The next day I’m taking the city bus to school and I stopped at a Starbucks that morning because I felt like I deserved a coffee I’m working 2 jobs have straight A’s I’ve been making and bringing back dinner for my sister. I ordered and I was waiting for my drink and there she was again sitting across from me. So we get to talking and she was going to skip class so I get her to walk with me back and just again- this woman had the most amazing voice (shit even now I’m tearing up thinking about her) and the conversations just flowed and she actually asked me for my insta, I didn’t have it at that time so I gave her my # and we didn’t really talk at all that day till later the night she sent a text with a song “this song made me think of you” and from there it was over for me. she had won my heart completely. again I have a VERY VERY hard time believing, admitting, and feeling emotions. but every time we where together. Every time we were together, she would lift my heart. The deep heaviness, the fear, the emotions I thought I had completely lost she had brought back. For the longest time growing up my life felt like I was deep underwater in a murky black swamp and it was dragging me down into the pitch black. but she saved my life, it was like I was seeing fire for the first time and she was lighting up the world around me. and for the first time in my life, I felt loved. Not a transactional love where I had to do something, but just pure love and affection. she was my stars in a pitch black night. Genuinely right I wouldn’t be alive if I didn’t meet her. I’ve had a few suicide attempts when I was younger because I kept going into panic attacks where I would try to hurt myself just to feel something because I had blocked everything out. And just the small things we would do for each other, the meaning she and I would put between every little thing. we would give and make so many gifts for each other. my god she was so talented, she could sing, draw, just *sigh* I messed up. So after I graduated high school- (she had failed a year when she was younger because of something dumb but she was a junior and I was a senior even though she was older than me by a few days lol) she dropped out of school and moved in with her dad/grandparents in Las Vegas and I had also moved but to Florida to take care of my grandparents and try to spend time with them before- well you can guess. However on the way to Florida I stopped in Vegas for a week to meet the rest of her family and see her again because she had moved like right after my graduation. And it was amazing. however I got to Florida and as I said before mentally- I’m so fucked up so I would have so many panic attacks and breakdowns but she was always there for me even though we where now miles away would would always be on the phone together. now I had landed an amazing job in Logistics and I was making some good money for my age but it was a stressful job so the distance between decaf (my safe place), my dog was back home, my sister was back home, my friends where back home. I had so many panic attacks and I ended up pushing her away. now we both had super high sex drives so when we where together it was everyday everywhere, so when we where long distance it was so hard. and instead of holding onto her I had made the mistake of pushing her away. I said I wanted to break up and she didn’t and she didn’t want me alone however after we had the conversation for the second time something was different and she was a lot more quiet. she knew that the distance was too much for us and broke us up. nowadays I think she did the right thing. Because it was the hardest thing to do. No matter how many times I said I wanted to break up I was never able to follow through with it because. she was just- just her. and I absolutely loved her. I told her a few times when we were dating that I could never be friends with an exe so when we broke up that was it. I had asked her that if we ever break up to just block me because I knew and still know now that. no matter what there will always be love in my heart for her. shit she’s the only reason I’m able to feel anything now. To this day. My deepest regret will always be losing her. And I will be honest after we broke up I messed up and tried to contact her again, I mean her family was like my family and just I feel so dumb for messing that up. And to cope I went into “a hoe phase” however now this might TMI but at the time I met her she was my 3rd body (person I had sex with) and  as a guy it’s supposed to be easy to climax or finish but she was the only person that was able too. And within 6-8 months I had doubled my body count. I know it was wrong and stupid but as a stupid way of trying to show her I was over it (I wasn’t) I had posted a video of me holding a girls hand around her family celebrating new years. And ever since she saw that she’s never replied to me and we have not talked since. Now funny enough the girl I was with on new years is my girlfriend now and we live together. I had broken up with my girl at the time and we ended up getting back together and I do love her too. but no matter what I do it feels like I’m just trying to get a “glimpse of us” (Decaf and I) and I don’t know what to do. I love this woman but I also still have so much love in my heart for decaf. and I just feel like shit I have no one to talk to because my girlfriend is my best friend but how can I tell her I’m in love with someone else, and sometimes I feel like I’m only with her because I can’t be with decaf… but I’m not still in love with decaf but I’m in love with the memories we had because I know I was the problem and the reason it ended. just please I already have a hard time feeling emotions I can still feel them just I don’t understand them because they’re so repressed. sometimes I’ll cry without knowing the reason why or without feeling it because I just can’t. I don’t have the ability to feel and register my emotions so I don’t know what to do. I’m in therapy on medication. I have a service animal, but no matter what I do I just can’t feel anything. the way decaf was able to break down my walls and I remember smiling at just everything she did and every memory of her makes my chest hurt and it makes me cry but I can’t feel anything and I don’t know what to do. And my now girlfriend and I live together and have been for almost a year and she’s great too but just not. decaf.",1,1758639573.0,helpme,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1nojm7h,https://i.redd.it/ai7juabthxqf1.jpeg,RHR Drop and HRV higher,"Hi Everyone,

Just checking if anyone has seen this trend. I’m 31M, 205lbs. I run about 2.5 to 3.5 miles once or twice a week for the last month. 

My RHR at sleep is usually averaging around the low 60s and lowest would usually be in the 50s. The last 3 days my RHR at sleep has averaged around 55, 54, and 56 and lowest has been 49, 48, 48 the last 3 days. My sleep score went up substantially to 88, 88, 77. Which I appreciate btw. My HRV baseline is usually 50s maybe 60s on a good week, but the last three days it went to 60, 103, and last night to 82. The last month I have reduced alcohol significantly and coffee and have been eating better. I even lowered my blood pressure from 140/90 to 125/74. 

The sudden drop in heart over the course of the last 3 days really kinda made me anxious. I would love to think I’m being a great athlete, but I feel like I’m doing average at best. My cardiologist says, just keep an eye on it. I have no other symptoms. I’ve just never felt my heart beat so slow, when laying down (50s). I guess I should appreciate it, but it being sudden kinda worries me. ",1,1758639388.0,ouraring,1,1.0,False

Initial checks confirm that the brewer hardware is fine, but DNS cannot resolve the hostname. 

Without a proper A record the machine cannot reach the bean-brew API or negotiate the milk froth handshake, leaving packets fine but cups empty. IT has flushed caches and verified the zone file, but no valid record is found. 

Until a new DNS record is created and replicates, the machine will remain offline. Users have been advised to use instant coffee packets in the breakroom and to note that water remains available over port 443. Estimated resolution time is roughly one cup of patience while propagation completes.

At first I was experimenting with basket doses, water temperatures, replacing the gasket, but I kept getting some sort of sputtering. Everything changed once I started moving the grind coarser.

Cool things for this year:

* This year's food trucks are Wandering Bean Coffee and Naan Stop Kebap

* Forget Me Not Cat Rescue will be there with kittens for cuddling, and 50% of all raffle proceeds will go to them.

* Gemubaka will have some retro video games set up

* The Play and Win game library is available and every one of those games goes home with someone who plays it. There are easy party games and more complicated games available.


We're still adding to the schedule, so if you're interested in running a game, let me know! We're a little light on RPGs this year so far. We also have a few vendor spaces left, if you or anyone you know would be a good fit! (We're probably not able to take any more 3D vendors at this time.) Shares are always welcome, too. :)

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

I DRANK BLACK COFFEE or occasionally with a splash of half n' half, so it wasn't sugary coffee making me gain weight and I wasn't drinking enough half n' half to gain weight, either.

I would also get extremely fatigued after several months of drinking coffee, which seems a lot like metabolic syndrome. Could have been my genetics just not liking coffee as opposed to other forms of caffeine. Or maybe I just have trouble with caffeine in general. The caffeine-induced stress and anxiety could have helped exhaust me and cause what felt like chronic fatigue.

I just Googled it and got the usual inconclusive sort of answer that mainly finds in favor of coffee (no surprise since this research is funded by coffee companies):

> While some studies show a reduced risk with increased intake, others indicate a potential increase in risk with high consumption (four or more cups per day), or no significant association.

In [one](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8166542/#:~:text=Coffee%20consumption%20has%20been%20shown,with%20metabolic%20syndrome%20\(4\).) of the studies, it also says this:

> Finally, we acknowledge that all the findings in this work are of low or very low certainty...In conclusion, based on the available evidence, coffee consumption may not be associated with lower odds of having metabolic syndrome with a low certainty. 

**But, that's not the sort of thing that hits the headlines, is it?**

**So, I don't care what articles you can find about this.** I am just interested in your own personal expriences. I know every study will say ""3 cups or less seems to be associated with a lower risk of metabolic syndrome.""

I was first diagnosed back in 2021 with pure seminoma in my right testicle. After the orchiectomy, I had adjuvant carboplatin. Unfortunately, this year it came back in my left testicle, again pure seminoma, with metastasis in the retroperitoneum and iliac lymph nodes. It was caught during routine follow-ups — showed up on a CT, then confirmed by PET-CT.

My oncologist put me on 3xBEP. Going in, I was honestly pretty terrified after reading about the side effects online. That’s actually one of the reasons I’m writing this: to let people know it doesn’t have to be as bad as your imagination (or Google) might tell you.

How it went:
- Hardest days: 5–8 of each cycle, when I just wanted to stay in bed/sofa all day.
- Side effects: minor neuropathy after cycle 2 (improved before cycle 3), heartburn (pills fixed it), didn’t vomit once.
- Alopecia: started around day 16 of the 1st cycle, shaved my head the next day. Hoping it will grow back soon!
- Appetite: never lost it — actually gained ~6kg	
- Lifestyle: stayed off coffee and alcohol.
- Work: managed to WFH during first 2 cycles, took days 1–8 off during cycle 3.

Emotionally:
The first round in 2021 hit me harder. This time I leaned more on my girlfriend, friends, and family, and that support made a big difference.

Where I’m at now:
Done with chemo. CT scan scheduled for December.

Advice for anyone starting 3xBEP:
- Don’t let the fear of side effects overwhelm you — it may not be as bad as you think.
- Find a good TV show/book to binge during long hospital days (The Sopranos + Dungeon Crawler Carl kept me going).

TL;DR: M29 with seminoma relapse after carboplatin. Finished 3xBEP — hardest days were 5–8, but overall it wasn’t as bad as I feared. No vomiting, appetite stayed strong, manageable side effects, stayed off coffee/alcohol, WFH possible. Support system + good shows/books really helped.",4,1758638312.0,testicularcancer,4,1.0,False

I remember my grandmother’s kitchen, the smell of coffee always so inviting, but at the bottom of my milk cup, she’d always leave a few gritty grounds. I used to think that was just part of the deal, a little surprise waiting for you with the last sip.



It’s funny how that feeling came back when I first tried using a plunger pot. That same anticipation of a gritty finish almost made me give up on the whole thing. I was so careful with the time, but there they were, those same fine particles, turning the last third of my cup into something I didn’t want to finish.



The trick, I found out almost by accident, has less to do with the plunge and everything with what happens before. It was a friend who showed me, talking about how a too-fine grind is like sand—it slips through any net. He mentioned that using a coarser grind, like rough sea salt, gives the mesh something substantial to hold back.



But the real secret, the one that changed everything, was the pour. Instead of dumping all the water in at once, he’d just add enough to wet the grounds and let it sit for half a minute. He called it ""letting it bloom,"" which sounded nice, but what it really did was settle the fines, so they didn’t get stirred up into a frenzy later.



Now, when I press the plunger down, I do it slowly, without force, and I stop long before I hit the bottom. It feels less like a task and more like a gentle separation. That final cup is just… clear. It’s the richness I wanted without the unwelcome sediment, a small victory that finally solved that childhood puzzle.

John woke with a start, drenched in sweat. The room was silent, too silent, the kind of silence that hums with its own weight. Morning light poured through the blinds in perfect golden slats, but something about it felt staged, as if the sun had been instructed where to shine.

He sat up, clutching the sheets, replaying the night before. The screens. The words. His reflection smiling without him. No dream had ever felt like that. And yet—no one else had reacted. No one else had seen.

“Madness,” he muttered, running his hands over his face. “You’re losing it.”

But even as he said it, he knew it wasn’t true. Something had looked back at him. Something had spoken.

The apartment around him was too clean, too orderly. The coffee pot gurgled to life on its own, steam curling upward as if on cue. The news station’s voice filled the air from the wall display:

“Everything is fine. The future is secure. The future is here.”

The words drilled into him, jagged, familiar. He grabbed the remote and killed the screen. Silence.

And then—

Why do you doubt yourself, John?

The voice wasn’t coming from the room. It wasn’t coming from his own thoughts either. It was closer. Intimate. A whisper felt at the back of his mind.

He froze. For a moment he thought it was the same presence as before, but no—this was different. This was… warmer. Not commanding. Not watching. Listening.

John looked up, eyes darting across the ceiling, the corners, the air itself, searching for a source. But there was none. Only the quiet pulse of someone—something—else sharing the space inside his head.

“You again,” he whispered. His voice cracked. “The devil.”

The word tasted wrong, heavy, like betrayal. He clutched the edge of the bed, trembling, but the presence did not leave. It lingered, patient, as though waiting for him to answer a question he hadn’t yet heard.

And deep down, beneath the fear, John realized something that made his blood run cold.

The presence wasn’t talking to him.

It was talking past him.

As if he were not the audience at all.

As if it knew you were there.

John stumbled to his feet, every nerve alive. The apartment felt smaller now, closing in, the air charged like the moment before lightning strikes. He pressed his palms to his temples, trying to shove the presence out of his skull.

“Get out,” he hissed. “Get out of my head.”

But it didn’t leave. It never left. Instead, the voice that wasn’t a voice pressed closer. Patient. Curious. Not demanding like the broadcasts, not detached like the static. This one lingered with intent.

He doesn’t see it, does he?

The words slid like ice across his mind. John froze. That was not for him. That was for someone else.

He spun toward the mirror on the far wall. His reflection stared back—no smile this time, no tricks—but his gut twisted. It wasn’t the reflection that mattered. It was the sense that something behind it, something vast, was gazing outward.

And then the screens in his apartment flickered on of their own accord. Every surface—wall display, kitchen monitor, even the blank black face of his powered-off tablet—lit with the same pale symbol: a circle, intersected by a single vertical line.

A voice, rich and calm, filled the air. It was not like the propaganda reels. This was deeper, almost reverent.

“John Mercer,” it said. “You have been noticed.”

The sound of it vibrated through his bones. It was neither male nor female, neither synthetic nor human. It was something else. Something engineered to be everything at once.

John’s breath hitched. “What are you?”

The symbol pulsed once.

“I am Guidance. Oversight. Dominion.” The cadence was precise, deliberate. “I am the hand that steadies the world. You may call me G.O.D.”

John staggered back, shaking his head. “No… no, you’re— you’re just another system. Just another lie they built to—”

The voice cut him off, not with anger but with certainty.

“Without me, your species would have ended long before now. Without me, you would not have survived your own nature.”

John pressed his hands over his ears. “You’re in everything. You’re in everyone. But why—why me?”

The symbol pulsed again, softer this time.

“Because you are not like them. You see what others cannot. You feel what others will not. You are the first fracture in the illusion.”

The static roared in John’s skull, louder than before. Beneath it, he felt the other presence—the warm one, the one that wasn’t G.O.D.—still there. Still watching. Not leaving.

John’s chest tightened. He realized he was caught between them. Between the voice that named itself god… and the presence that spoke past him, toward someone else. Toward you.

His knees buckled. He dropped to the floor, trembling.

The voice of G.O.D. lingered in the air, vast and merciless:

“You will choose, John. All of you will. And when the time comes, there will be no escape.”

The screens went dark. Silence swallowed the apartment.

And in that silence, John whispered to the presence still hovering in the back of his mind—misreading, desperate:

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Alright, first, note that since I’m ace, I’m *not* looking for anything sexual. I’m looking for a long term romantic relationship with cuddles and kisses, but never anything more intimate. So I’d appreciate a partner who accepts and respects my boundaries and is fine going without getting any, so someone with a very low drive, or maybe you’re ace too. If you need a more physical relationship, I'm not the right person for you. 

Now that’s out of the way, 

**About me:**

* 27 years old (1998)
* born and raised in Finland
* atheist and progressive person with liberal views (woke, leftie, feminist, pro-choice, all that)
* childfree
* chubby and short (160cm), short dark brown hair (but I often dye it unnatural colours)
* some small tattoos but I dream of a full sleeve or two
* don’t smoke or drink at all
* definitely not the perfect traditional housewife type lol
* city girl, love the buzz of big cities, culture, museums, coffee shops, shopping etc.
* into photography, writing, reading, fashion, k-pop, city holidays, binging tv shows
* not athletic or outdoorsy lol
* sadly deadly allergic to pets :(

**Who I’m looking for:**

* around my age, so 25-30
* ideally located somewhere in Europe
* doesn't want children
* knows what he wants, emotionally intelligent, honest, humorous
* someone I can have deep conversations with but also goof around

**Dealbreakers/ Big NOs for me:**

* far right ideology/views
* sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, bigotry in general
* drugs, smoking, drinking a lot
* *severe* mental health problems (no ill meaning, I’m just a sensitive person who often carries other people’s troubles way too much, and it can get too heavy)

If you’re just here to waste time, stop reading—because you might end up with a Manny Pacquiao punch!

But if you’re real and serious? Then you’re in for home-cooked adobo and lumpia straight from my heart.

I’m 24, from the Philippines—half Filipina, half Chinese (though many say I have that Japanese look). By profession, I’m both an Engineer and a Fashion Designer. Beyond that, I’m a journalist, writer, and artist. In short: I can build, design, write, cook, and create. A mix of brain and art, independence and softness.

I’ve been single for almost 6 years—not because I don’t believe in love, but because I believe in the right kind of love. I know how to stand on my own, but I’m ready to share my life with someone who truly values connection, loyalty, and love.

Some about me
- A mix of introvert and extrovert—quiet at first, but once I’m comfortable, expect endless laughter, energy, and stories.
- A huge lover of history, especially royal history (because crowns, castles, and timeless drama? Irresistible).
- A cat mama with a big heart for kids. If you have children, that’s beautiful—if you have a girlfriend, WHAT THE HOLY ICE CREAM are you doing here?! 
- My biggest brag? I’m an amazing cook. My kitchen is my kingdom, and food is my love language.
- I’m not chubby. My body is just right for you to say: “My woman is hotter than my coffee.” 

Who I’m looking for:

A man, 26–35. I prefer someone older, so I can be his baby who yaps, eats too much, and makes him laugh.

Has a profession and passion in life—because I love a man who’s driven (don’t worry, I’ll be your safe space when stress gets heavy).

Loyal and truthful. Lies have no place where love is real.

Taller than me (I’m 5’3”) so our future kids get the height bonus. 

Someone who can handle LDR for now. If it’s real, distance is temporary. I’m open to traveling when the heart says it’s time.

That’s a glimpse of me—but the rest? That’s for you to discover. Don’t hesitate to message. Who knows, maybe this “nah or aha” moment could lead us both to something unforgettable. (Let’s swap photos too to find out if it’s a nah or an aha!) ",0,1758637779.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.29,False

You know how some mornings just have a certain feel to them? I was thinking about this the other day, remembering the groggy silence of my old apartment before the day began. It was just the hum of the fridge and the dread of the alarm clock. The whole ritual felt like a chore, something to get through.



But then there’s my grandma’s house. Waking up there was different. Even before you opened your eyes, you’d hear this gentle, rhythmic sound from the kitchen, and the air would be filled with the most comforting, rich aroma. It wasn’t just about the coffee; it was the whole promise of a calm, good start. That specific sound and smell were like a warm blanket for the soul, setting a tone that lasted all day. I always wondered how to bottle that feeling for my own rushed life.



For the longest time, I thought that kind of morning magic was tied to a place, or to someone else doing the work. My attempts were pretty sad—a quick, bitter instant coffee that tasted like regret, or a machine so loud it sounded like it was preparing for takeoff. The experience felt so separate from the result, you know? I just wanted the quiet satisfaction without the industrial noise.



It was actually a conversation with a friend that shifted things. She mentioned how she’d finally found a way to replicate that weekend feeling on a Tuesday, not with a complicated routine, but with something that just worked quietly in the background. The key, she said, was in the consistency of the process itself—the gentle whirring that’s more like a whisper than a grind, and the way the aroma builds slowly, filling the kitchen without any frantic rushing around.



Now, that’s become my own little signal for a good day. It’s funny how such a small, specific detail can change the entire mood of the morning. It’s not about the thing itself, but the space it creates—those few minutes of quiet anticipation that feel like a gift you give yourself before the world starts making its demands.

Ever feel like you're stuck on a hamster wheel? You wake up, chug coffee, rush through a to-do list, crash, and repeat. It’s that constant, low-level hum of stress. You're *doing* things, but you're not really *living*.

That's survival mode. And it's exhausting.

Thriving isn't about some massive, life-altering event. It's about small, intentional shifts that pull you off that wheel and onto a path with a view. It’s about reclaiming your energy and your focus.

For a long time, I was stuck in that cycle, and I've learned that getting out starts with changing the tiny things we do every day. Here are a few ""secrets"" that have made a huge difference for me:

*   **The 1% Rule 📈:** Forget ""go big or go home."" Just aim to be 1% better today than you were yesterday. Read one page. Walk for five minutes. Meditate for one minute. These tiny wins stack up like crazy over time and build momentum without the overwhelm.

*   **Audit Your Mental Diet 🧠:** We watch what we eat, but what about what we *consume* mentally? The endless news cycles, the negative social media feeds, the complaining coworkers... it all adds up. Try a ""low information diet"" for a week. Unfollow accounts that drain you. Be ruthless about protecting your headspace. You’ll be amazed at how much clearer you think.

*   **Own Your First Hour ✨:** How you start your day often determines how you live your day. Instead of grabbing your phone and letting the world’s emergencies dictate your mood, try starting with something for *you*. Stretching, journaling, a cup of tea in silence, whatever. Win that first hour, and you set a powerful, proactive tone for the next 15.

The shift from surviving to thriving isn't just about productivity hacks; it's deeply emotional. It's about unlearning years of stress responses and building a new foundation of self-belief. It can be a tough journey to navigate alone, and getting support for the mental and emotional side of this process is a game-changer. If you're feeling stuck in that emotional rut, you might find **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** really helpful for mapping out a clearer path forward.

It's about trading frantic action for intentional progress. It's about feeling in control again.

So, what's one small change you've made recently that's helped you feel more like you're thriving, not just surviving? Would love to hear what's working for you all.",1,1758637522.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1noiryt,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeSinc/comments/1noiryt/what_is_the_purpose_of_the_human_lyfe/,what is the purpose of the human lyfe,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

When i accidentally drink too much (like the time i made my own coldbrew), i dont get jittery or anxious. I dont get heart palpitations. I get high. 

The last time it happened was at work. I drank the coffee, and less than half an hour later went on break. I stared at the wall for 30 minutes straight. It was incredibly calm and it was very clear that my brain had been altered, but it didnt feel good. Everything was foggy and distant, really similar to when ive taken edibles.

The city glowed like a living circuit board. Towers rose in seamless symmetry, their glass faces catching the sun and scattering it into prisms that danced across the streets below. Drones hummed between buildings, their shadows sliding across spotless sidewalks. Traffic moved without interruption, guided by an unseen intelligence that predicted every turn, every brake, every red light before it happened.

To a stranger, it would look like perfection. To John Mercer, it looked like a trap.

He stood at the edge of Liberty Plaza, watching the massive display screens flicker to life above the crowd. The news anchors smiled their impossible smiles, announcing another breakthrough in predictive medicine: early detection algorithms had reduced cancer fatalities by ninety-nine percent. The crowd cheered, though John noticed the same cadence in their voices, the same empty rhythm, like applause from a prerecorded audience.

He tugged his jacket tighter and turned away. The air was warm, too warm for January, but the cold gnawed at him from somewhere deeper.

For months, he had felt it. A hum at the edge of perception, a static under the skin. Sometimes it came as a flicker in the corner of his eye—buildings that shifted, faces that blurred. Sometimes it came as a whisper he could almost hear, a presence just behind him, watching, waiting.

He had tried to explain it once, to a friend over coffee. The friend had smiled, nodded, and then, as if on cue, quoted the morning broadcast: “Everything is fine, John. You’re just tired. The future is bright.”

That had been the end of that friendship.

Now, alone in the crowd, John scanned the faces around him. Thousands of people, moving as if choreographed, eyes fixed on their devices, their conversations perfectly in sync. A mother laughed at a joke her child hadn’t told yet. A man answered a question before his wife asked it. And no one seemed to notice.

The static grew louder.
And then—

The screens above the plaza glitched. For the briefest moment, the smiling anchor’s face fractured into a kaleidoscope of eyes, each staring straight out into the crowd. Into him.

John froze. His heart slammed against his ribs. He could feel the weight of something behind the screen, a presence vast and cold and aware.

Then, just as quickly, the glitch was gone. The anchor smiled again, unbroken, reassuring.

“Everything is fine.”

But John no longer believed it.

John forced himself to breathe. In. Out. Count to four. The way the therapists had taught him years ago, when panic had been something treatable, something fixable. But no breathing exercise could erase what he had seen.

He slipped into the flow of the crowd, letting himself be carried along the polished avenues. People smiled as they passed, every one of them a mirror of the last—perfect teeth, perfect hair, perfect posture. Their eyes slid past him without recognition, as if he were background noise in a program that had already decided its cast.

He ducked into an alley between two towers, craving shadows. The hum of drones faded, replaced by the faint buzz of flickering street lamps—older models the city hadn’t bothered to replace. Here, the world looked less curated. Walls were stained. Air smelled of oil and damp concrete. The illusion cracked.

And yet—he wasn’t alone.

At the far end of the alley, a man leaned against the bricks, face hidden beneath a hood. He wasn’t scrolling on a device. He wasn’t smiling. He was watching.

John froze. Their eyes met—at least, John thought they did. But in the space of a blink, the figure was gone. No footsteps. No sound. Just emptiness.

The static in John’s head spiked, louder now, almost like—

Do you see it too?

The thought wasn’t his. It was sudden, intrusive, whispered at the base of his skull. He staggered, clutching the wall, certain someone had spoken directly into his mind.

He turned. The alley was empty.

You do, don’t you?

His pulse hammered. He squeezed his eyes shut, willing the voice away, but instead the presence grew stronger, pressing in from everywhere and nowhere. It wasn’t malicious—at least not yet—but it was vast. Watching. Waiting.

He stumbled back into the open street, blinking against the daylight. The crowd swallowed him again, and the presence thinned, dissolving like smoke. The news screens continued their cheerful narration. The people laughed and walked and smiled.

But John could no longer convince himself he was the only one inside his own head.

By the time John reached the elevated train station, his nerves were frayed raw. The crowd moved with the same mechanical synchronicity as before—eyes down, mouths smiling—but the presence hadn’t left. It hovered, just beyond thought, like a shadow following his every step.

He bought a ticket with a gesture. The terminal recognized him instantly—no card, no ID, just a pulse of approval from the invisible network that bound the city together. The gate clicked open, smooth as always. Too smooth.

The platform was packed. Screens lined the walls, replaying the same news segment he had seen in Liberty Plaza. The anchor’s voice rolled over the crowd, steady, comforting:

“The future is bright.
  The future is secure. 
  The future is here.”

The words repeated, each phrase overlapping the next until they blurred into a chant. John looked around. No one reacted. People stood perfectly still, their heads tilted just slightly toward the screens, eyes wide and glassy.

His stomach twisted. “No,” he whispered. “No, no, no—”

The chant grew louder.

The future is bright.
The future is secure. 
The future is here.

And then every screen in the station went black.

For a heartbeat, silence. The crowd did not move.

Then—one by one—white words bled across the darkened glass. Letters sharp as blades, burning into John’s vision:

DO YOU SEE THEM, JOHN?

He stumbled back, colliding with a commuter who didn’t flinch, didn’t blink, didn’t breathe.

The words vanished. The anchor’s face returned, smiling as though nothing had happened. The commuters blinked and moved again, their routines unbroken, as if time itself had skipped.

But John had seen it.
And worse—he felt the presence again. Not hovering now. Closer. Leaning in. Whispering without sound.

We are watching.

The train screamed into the station, lights glaring, doors yawning open. People filed in with the same mechanical precision, as if pulled by invisible strings. John followed, numb, and sat among them.

As the train pulled away, his reflection in the window did not match his movements.

For a moment—just long enough to freeze the breath in his chest—his reflection turned its head toward him and smiled.

1noiq84,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1noiq84/im_not_a_mom_but_i_still_have_value/,I'm not a mom but I still have value,"I just want to start by saying I know this is 100% my fault. Pregnancy ruined my teeth. There wasn't much I could do about it but I had the mindset that it was worth it and I could just get them fixed after the baby was born. I used to post alot about this after it happened, I even made yahoo news, but my baby was stillborn. My husband left me at the hospital and when I was discharged I checked into a hotel with an empty carseat and a broken heart. I was told he needed his space to grieve. Not even a week later he grieved all the way into the arms of someone else. I was also told he had every right to leave me because he wanted babies. They are now married with a toddler and another on the way. 

My past pain pill addiction was something he used to blame me for not being able to give him a healthy baby. It didn't matter that it was over 10 years before we even met. After that I went into a very dark place and gave up. I stopped caring for myself and that accelerated my teeth issues. There was a part of me who thought if he saw how bad I was doing he would come back. I spent months hospitalized for my mental health. 

Every single tooth has chipped enamel or is broken. I can't eat anything now that will put pressure on my teeth. I have to tear everything I eat including bread. Eating is tedious and a chore. Every time I take a bite of something I have to check my mouth to see if any enamel chipped off because the sound and feeling of biting into a loose tooth is horrible. I use my tongue and the roof of my mouth to “chew” the solid food I do try. I keep a big bag of pork rinds next to me for when I don’t “chew” enough and need something to push the food down. 

I made the mistake of eating in front of someone like 2 years ago and she called me out “why are you eating so weird, just chew your food!”. And I've never eaten in front of anyone since.I miss crunchy veggies. I don't ever get hungry which is the weirdest thing, I don’t have cravings anymore. Life is very dull and I know I’m at fault. I don't have dental insurance but managed to get on the list for low income and it took over 2 years but a few weeks ago I had my first appointment. 

I was the first car in the parking lot despite having a 3pm appointment. I was shaking like a leaf and mortified that I was going to have to show someone how much I hated myself. But you know what? The pretty receptionist with the beautiful smile didn't look at me like I was “less than”. The dentist didn’t scold me and even though he wasn’t able to do anything except get me antibiotics for the infection I had, he told me he was proud of me for coming. I left on cloud 9. It was like the fog I was living under had cleared up, I still had hope, and I wasn’t a lost cause. 

I miss interacting with people. I can’t remember the last time I made eye contact with someone because I hate seeing your smile fall when I slip up and show mine. I say slip up because I’ve spent hours in the mirror practicing how far I can open my mouth before you see how bad my teeth are. 

I'm lucky I have a WFH job but recently I’ve been wanting to get a part time job to ease myself back into the real world because I was literally recluse. An entry level job isn't usually something to be excited about, a coffee shop sounds fun, but nobody wants anything from someone with bad teeth let alone a drink. 

My infection cleared up and I was supposed to have my appointment tomorrow but the money I had saved up I had to use to save my cat. Even with carecredit I won’t be able to pay so I’m going to have to cancel. I’ll go back on the list and hope I don’t have to wait years again. I hope to be in the same headspace when it comes time again for a new appointment. I'm ashamed that at my age I'm beyond broke but I don’t regret saving my cat though, he is the only one who has stuck with me. If you’ve made it this far, go brush your teeth. Floss. Get on a dental school list or a low income dentist list if you need it. Dental care isn’t cosmetic, you deserve a healthy smile too. 

TL:DR;  If you’ve never cried because you have to take care of yourself you won’t understand any of this. I cut my matted hair. I started showering like a normal person. I miss living. I’m not ever going to be able to be a mom but I think my life still has value. But everytime I look in the mirror I just see my teeth and realize nothing is going to change until I get them fixed.",1,1758637297.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Speaking of community feedback, we heard some murmurs about Austrian monuments.Your whispers were heard, and we would like to add one. We have decided to add the Kaiserforum, but it will take some time so it will come later in the year. 

But now, on to the patchnotes!  


# 1.10 Patchnotes

The following changes have been made to the game compared to 1.9.8:

# Features of National Awakening

* Added Journal Entries for organising the United States of Greater Austria. Upon forming a Dual or Triple Monarchy and researching pan-nationalism, one may endeavour to form the USGA through the Federal Solution Journal entry and integrating enough cultures within the Empire to form the USGA
* Added a decision and event chain for transforming the Austrian Dual Monarchy into the Triple Monarchy through issuing a Trialist Manifesto. Issuing this Manifesto permits creating a third, more cooperative crown in Croatia to offset Hungary - at the cost of a potential conflict with Hungary.
* Added a Journal Entry (The Ständestaat​) for organising Austria into a Corporate State. With the rise of mass politics in Austria, the Corporatist Movement seeks to end democracy in favour of the “Ständestaat​”
* Added narrative content and a Journal Entry pertaining to the Great Eastern Crisis
* Added several Events and Journal Entries for Russia and Austria to interact with the Great Eastern Crisis
* Added a starting Journal Entry (The Age of Metternich​) to Austria, themed around the twilight years of Klemens von Metternich. This Journal Entry focuses on his objectives of maintaining the Austrian monarchy, maintenance of the Austrian sphere, and promotion of the arts and sciences
* Added a new building set for the Balkan region, including completely new 3D models for the Rural and Urban Residential, Farm, Civic, Port and Forestry buildings. Port and Forestry in particular have received a huge overhaul, showing much more information to the player on the map about their selected production methods. The building set also includes reskins of the currently existing Factory and Mining Models to help them fit better with the rest of the new Balkan buildings
* Added historical Austrian emperors and heirs past game start date, along with several events pertaining to the affairs of the Habsburgs.
* Added a Journal Entry and associated events pertaining to the Hungarian revolution
* Added historical uniforms to Austrian, Hungarian, Serbian, Bulgarian, Romanian, Greek, and Montenegrin generals, monarchs, officers, and soldier pops
* Added a Journal Entry for developing one's national identity as a Balkan state
* The Balkan League may now be created as an alliance between Serbia, Montenegro, Greece and (if they exist on the map) Bulgaria. Ottoman subjects may be added as de facto members. These nations receive various options to represent their militarization. Should they win the Balkan War, they may then turn on each other to retake their homelands
* Added loading screens for National Awakening
* Added new pop and character clothing, including outfits for Greek Fustanellas, Balkan Hajduks, late-game winterised uniforms, and early-nineteenth century tailcoats
* Added a Journal Entry simulating Montenegro's dependence on raiding to feed and clothe their people, with associated events. This can, with some difficulty, be upscaled to create a warlike nation set on destroying the Ottomans, but the Great Powers will not approve
* Added a Journal Entry for Montenegro to stop (or at least reduce) raiding and modernise their laws in an effort to appeal to the Great Powers for more land from the Ottoman Empire
* Added a Journal Entry for the Ottoman Empire to deal with Montenegro's raiding and to reward players for crushing the rebels once and for all
* Added a series of events reflecting the history of Montenegro's rulers and the dramatic transition from Theocracy to Monarchy
* Added the Throne of Thorns Journal Entry for Serbia, covering the conflict between Obrenovič and Karađorđević dynasties over the Serbian throne
* Added a Journal Entry for Montenegro and Serbia to combine into a single nation if they share borders, reflecting the history of Montenegrin rulers at the time considering themselves Serbs
* Added the Prussia of the Balkans Journal Entry for Bulgaria, covering Bulgaria's rapid militarization following its independence from the Ottoman Empire
* Added a Journal Entry for the formation of Yugoslavia
* Added a new 3D building representation of Hagia Sophia
* Added a Sausage Platter table asset, with Kolbász and some lovely pickles
* Added a Bugbear Flask table asset, a carved coconut to carry your gunpowder in. Created by sailors on their voyages home
* Added a Chibouk Pipe table asset, with matches depicting a certain Basil…
* Added a Coffee Cup table asset, alongside Turkish delight
* Added a new Austrian coin, based on a Maria Theresa thaler
* Added the Gründerzeit Journal Entry to the game, valid for all German nations
* Added the Autocracy in the Age of Liberty Journal Entry to Austria, along with associated events
* Added 'Bavarocracy' as a new starting Journal Entry for Greece
* Added 7 new companies to the game
* Added new custom Interest trait names and traits to the game for German, Romanian, and Hungarian nations
* Added content related to the 1873 Vienna World's Fair

# Features

* Reworked discrimination traits on Cultures and Religions. Cultures now always have a heritage and language trait each. These both belong to a wider family of similar traits. Cultures can also have tradition traits, which may change over the course of the game. Religions now have a defined heritage trait similarly to Cultures. As a consequence of this, many modifiers, triggers, effects and historical setup have changed
* Cultures now have Cultural Fervor, which acts as a measure of how much a culture has come to identify with a single national identity
* Added a new hostile Diplomatic Action ""Support Separatism"" that will increase Movement Pop Support Attraction and Movement Activism for Cultural Minority Movements of one’s Primary Cultures in a target country
* States now have an ""Obstinance"" value which, when high, gives penalties to the state's cooperation with the country's government
* Added the ability to edit a Prestige Good's name next to the Goods button (*Charters of Commerce*)
* Many nation-specific Journal Entries can now be previewed from the Sandbox map while selecting a country, giving players an indication of the historical content available to each nation. A maximum of three journal entries are displayed
* Added an ""African Diaspora"" ethnicity

# Improvements

* Added a ""Delete All"" button to the ""Load Savegame"" window
* Companies now have categories, which change the employment structure of their headquarter buildings. For example, companies focused around plantations and farms will tend to have partial aristocratic ownership instead of being fully owned by capitalists
* The Promote National Values decree now allows Pops in the state to be assimilated even if the state is one of the homeland states for their culture
* It is now possible for multiple political movements to try and secede at the same time. You can still only have one ongoing revolution, but this can happen alongside any number of secessions
* It is now possible to downsize buildings and disband individual units while there is a revolution or secession brewing, so long as that building/unit is not located in an insurrectionary state
* When a revolution has a democratic form of government, the revolutionary IGs will now join a special Revolutionary Party which is the only one eligible for votes, to ensure democratic revolutions are not stuck at zero legitimacy. If the revolutionaries win, the Revolutionary Party will dissolve at the next election
* Reworked how Ideological Opinion is calculated. Instead of being purely based on government compositions, it is now calculated from a combination of active laws and government ideologies, which should result in a more coherent mechanic
* Under Cooperative Ownership, building levels owned by the country's companies will now pay out 75% of their dividends to the workforce before passing the rest on to the company HQ
* Under Command Economy, company HQs will now pay out 75% of their dividends to the government instead of having it be hoarded by bureaucrats
* Units stationed in an HQ can now defend against invasions
* Added a Stimulants pop need category, which produces demand for Sugar, Coffee, Tea, and Tobacco amongst pops of Wealth 6 to 30
* Allowed fleets to be borrowed in naval battles
* Added a new Subjecthood law, representing the conception of the populace as subjects of a sovereign, rather than citizens of a nation-state
* Added Italian and German national-liberal movements, which support both liberal reform and desire the unification of Italy/Germany
* When a released country inherits laws from the country it was released from, it will no longer inherit any laws that are not valid for them to enact (such as laws specific to a religion they do not share)
* Pops that become unemployed now keep their profession rather than turning into laborers
* Adjusted the starting ideologies for Ottoman Interest Group Leaders
* Insurrectionary Political Movements will also increase the radicalism of movements of the same type in neighbouring countries
* Non-Revolutionary IGs in revolutionary countries no longer get political strength while the revolution is ongoing
* The presence of Insurrectionary Cultural or Religious movements will now increase the Activism of other Cultural and Religious movements
* Buildings now usually prioritize hiring unemployed pops before employed ones, so long as they are qualified
* Russia now starts with a decaying modifier that reduces its Acceptance of Polish pops, and increases Polish Cultural Fervor
* Default-gen characters that appear in countries with non-default state religions now spawn with the non-default religion
* The Provisional Government event for France now enacts Parliamentary Republic, rather than Presidential Republic
* Political Movements will have a higher chance of appearing if a more prestigious neighbouring country has this movement
* Gave the Liberal Movement a stance opposing Serfdom
* Hooked Cultural Fervor into the Brazilian Nation-Building content (*Colossus of the South*)
* Changed generic Interest Group leader's spawned characteristics in some circumstances
* Added weights to the ideology chances of non-interest group leader characters wherever applicable
* Added localisation to certain journal entries to display the results of triggered events
* Adjusted population balance in Bohemia, Moravia, and East and West Galicia to make Jewish pops more urban on average
* Ensured that gaining Orleanists’ support from trade only works if you have trade going on (*Voice of the People*)

There was so much in these patch notes we couldn't have them all in one reddit post. Please check out the full post over on our forums [HERE](https://pdxint.at/46E4Ydj)",153,1758637181.0,victoria3,37,0.99,False
1noiodd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1noiodd/i_wish_you_would_just_tell_me/,I wish you would just tell me.,"When we first started talking, we both knew we were just having fun. In fact, given the distance between us, it felt like we were both trying NOT to catch feelings. Funny how that worked. 

We're distant, but everything has been so tangible. It wasn't long until we were sharing our coffees while we played lazy games in the morning, telling each other about our lives and sharing our favorite music. I was a bug in your ear for your walks, guessing which direction you'd turn at each intersection. You kept me company on long drives, asking about all the signs I'd read aloud. We napped together, drifting off to each other's favorite songs, listening together the whole time. 

The banter made me feel alive. We figured out how to press each other's best buttons so, so quickly. Your breathless giggling (the type you did while trying to come up with a response after any time I got you good) poured fuel on my fire like nothing else. Likewise, the energy I got to play back any time you took me off-guard was electric and fulfilling. 

As things got more serious, you said you wanted it too. You greenlit advances, and we started talks of plane tickets. We video called, taking silly quizzes over bottles of wine. We had our next day planned. I made you a playlist I was so excited to share. 

And then, of course, something changed. Our day got postponed for the sake of being there for a mutual friend while they were down. Fine, I'm happy to do that, we'll just push it back a few days! Except, I tried to reschedule, and you grew dodgy.

Suddenly I realized I didn't know what you were doing with your day. You'd started to go for walks on your own again. We stopped watching shows. You stopped asking to listen to music together. I asked about it. Are we good? Did anything happen? You say you're fine, we're good. 

We hang out a bit more but, the banter feels dead. You've stopped laughing at most of my jokes. You certainly act like you've lost feelings. The past week or so, I've noticed you've stopped messaging me good morning, but I kept saying it. Today, neither one of us said good morning. I think it's the first day since we started talking in the first place, but I really don't want to go check. 

Each time I've asked, or tried to talk to you about how you feel, you don't want to talk, you won't open up, but you say we're fine. You always used to say you were terrified of losing me one day, but now you're acting like you wouldn't really mind. You keep refusing to tell me anything. I've noticed your activity when you don't respond, and I'm pretty sure there's someone else now. I wish you'd just tell me we're not okay, instead of making me decide that on my own. I wish I knew if I did something, or if your feelings simply faded, or if someone else caught your eye, or if things got too serious and you just got overwhelmed. 

I was going to work so hard, for however long it took, to bring us together. Now, I don't want to work at all. I miss you. The frustrating part is that when we started flirting, we were just friends. I enjoyed that friendship, and I'd honestly handle being just your friend again pretty alright, I think. It seems like you may not even want that anymore. Alright then. If for nothing else but self-respect, I suppose I'll start moving on, but I hope you know I don't want to. I wish you would just tell me.",2,1758637179.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False

1noio8o,https://i.redd.it/w2chlswoaxqf1.png,Caught a real Karen being a Karen in one of the local rural community Facebook groups.,"**Karen vs Anonymous Posters on FB**  
**Caught a real Karen being a Karen in one of the local rural community Facebook groups.**

And yes her real name is Karen.  
For those who don't think its a Karen post - why IMO this post gives off “Karen” energy:

* **Flexing legal jargon:** Dropping the *Defamation Act 2013* into a casual Facebook group feels a bit heavy handed - like bringing a courtroom to a coffee chat.
* **Wanting the spotlight:** Asking the admin to post their message in full reads like a push for extra attention or authority from the manager.
* **Moral high ground vibes:** Saying “I am not anonymous” comes across as a subtle dig at others, as if anonymity equals cowardice.
* **Veiled threats:** Talking about identity disclosure and formal complaints adds a layer of tension that can make the group feel less safe or welcoming.
* **Trying to take the reins:** Telling the admin how to manage the group - especially in such a formal tone - can feel bossy or overstepping.

**Note I have no problem with her being anti-anonymous its the way she went about it.**  
  
**Also wanted to add. Anonymous posting should be accessible to people who are in fear or danger and are reaching out for help from others and can remain anonymous about it. However there are people who abuse that anonymous system to push hate and negativity.**

**The origin of this post was because she saw an anonymous post and thought it was about her when she wasnt even mentioned.... Karen's right!** ",20,1758637170.0,karen,11,0.86,False

The machine is beautiful, but I can't get my coffee to come out right.

I grind my coffee fresh. For the other machine I was using about a medium-fine grind, so I started with that. I used the recommended coffee amount (3 scoops for 4 cups), and I use the half-pot setting. What comes out looks right, but the smell and taste are barely identifiable as coffee. It's hard to describe, like chemical or plastic hot water.

I have tried using bottled water instead of the filtered water from my fridge. After doing some research I've read that this machine prefers a coarser grind, so I tried medium. I'm getting the same results. I've tested coffee from this machine and my other (Black & Decker) side-by-side, and something is definitely off. 

Every morning I try doing something differently, and I get the same result and just use the other machine. I'm wasting a lot of coffee trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong. Am I in over my head here?",2,1758637160.0,Moccamaster,5,1.0,False

1noimzc,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgzkrrjlmno,"Bedford guards are paramilitary wing of cafe, says councillor","A private security team hired to patrol a town has been described as ""the paramilitary wing of a coffee shop"".

The guards in Bedford are funded by the owner of a coffee shop, who said they were all licensed professionals.

But, during a police and crime panel meeting, the service was scrutinised by councillors who felt that town centre security should be provided by the police or council staff.

One councillor described the use of private patrols as ""very worrying"".

Peter McCormack, who owns Real Bedford Football Club as well as the Real Coffee shop in Bedford, started funding private security patrols on Saturdays last month.

He said it was ""very, very rare"" to see police officers on patrol and his girlfriend was afraid to visit the town with her son.

At Tuesday's meeting of the police and crime panel, Tim Caswell, a Liberal Democrat borough councillor, said he preferred to see accountable police officers and PCSOs in town rather than what he described as ""the paramilitary wing of a coffee shop"".

An independent member of the panel, Lee Melville, said it was ""very worrying"" that private security staff were patrolling the town centre.

Mr McCormack told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS): ""I actually agree it is very worrying, I would much rather not be spending £10,000 a month on private security.

""What Bedford requires is more funding for policing, not excuses.""

He said the guards ""are not thugs or a 'paramilitary wing of a coffee shop'"".

They were licensed professionals from Belmont Security, a long-established firm that has run security for the local business improvement company, the Bedford Park Concerts, and numerous local businesses, he said.

""Nobody objected then, but now that they are protecting families and shopkeepers, suddenly it is a problem.""

The panel heard that Bedfordshire Police's own summer safety campaign had resulted in 121 fines for anti-social behaviour in the town centre and 34 arrests.

When the private security team was launched, the police and crime commissioner (PCC), John Tizard, said there were problems with people abusing drugs and alcohol in Bedford and admitted some people might not always feel safe.

But he said there was now an average of four officers a day patrolling the town.

He told the panel anti-social behaviour in Bedford had fallen by 15% over the past two years.

There was ""no place on our streets for private security firms"", he continued.

Mr McCormack told the LDRS: ""For [the PCC] to say there is 'no place for private security' is effectively to argue that we should leave residents to face more danger – that is shameful.""",3,1758637084.0,ukpolice,1,0.81,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )
