1ingrux,https://www.reddit.com/r/Enneagram/comments/1ingrux/what_can_rejection_triad_tell_us_about_nature_of/,What can rejection triad tell us about nature of power over others?,"I am in eastern side (Chinese rooted, living in Thailand) of the world and it seems like our concept of power is quite different from western. And I think it is interesting to share and talk about.

In my country Enneagram, we call rejection triad power triad. Rejection triad represent three types of power: Violence, Knowledge and Love.

So, we have three ways to gain authorative influence over other human being. One is violence, to coerce others into submission by force. One is to have knowledge and outwit others. One is to have love, to grab people heart.

I think power in form of violence (represent by 8s) is already discussed widely so I don't see much point in repeating that. It's simply ability to control, to have direct physical consequence over others, etc etc. 

It is too obvious to the point that many people think that is only form of ""real power"". And that is exactly why I want to write this post, to remind ourselves to not overlook other form of power.

**Power of knowledge**

Well, one thing people tends to forget is that in order to have power over a thing, you first need to know that thing exists. And that's the pure smallest form of knowledge.

You might be a king. You might have a lot of army. You might be able to command everything. But you can't destroy, crush or command rebel if you don't even know who is on your side and who is on rebel side.

You need to know something in order to have power over that thing. At minimum, you need to know that thing exists to begin with. 

Nowadays no matter how rich, resourceful or economically powerful you are, you can't have power over Satoshi Nakamoto creator of Bitcoin. Because we don't know them, we can't have power over them no matter how big our force is.

You need to know where, when. And if you know about strength, weakness, etc. The more you know about them, the more power you have over them.

And that's power of knowledge.

In Chinese history, there was a big big army who got crushed by Zhuge Liang simply who know about weather, and basically destroy the whole army using power of weather prediction. He knows the direction of the wind. He set a small fire which through power of the wind, becoming a big fire that destroy whole enemy army fleet.

Or be more recent, USA basically win WW2 because knowledge of nuclear physics and then lose Vietnam war because of knowledge of terrain and being so ellusive.

Knowledge is a form of power.

**Power of love**

Now this is the form of power that I think many people overlook. The power over other people heart.

Love is power over your heart. Love can make you blind. Love can make you subdue to your lover on your own will.

Love is not just a romantic love. Maybe it is just simply a favor. It is embedded in our human psyche that when someone do something for you, you have a natural tendency to pay something back. And if you don't, you feel guilty.

That is why many people hate toxic 2s. Technically speaking, toxic 2s pattern is just they serve you and give you things. Then when you stop reciprocating they just simply say bunch of words.

Technically speaking, you haven't been physically attack and you lose nothing at this point. And yet, you can't help feeling attacked. You feel like your strings is being pulled toward something like a mannequin you don't like it at all.

And that ability to pull and play with emotional string, is power of love.

To demonstrate this power: I would go back to story of the kings.

There were so many historical & legend of eastern kings who have his heart grab by his queen, mistress or concumbine.

Technically speaking: The king can order execution of his mistress with just single word and his soldier will do exactly that, no question asked. 

And yet the king can't bring his body or his mouth to do that. Furthermore, the idea of harming his mistress will never ever come to his mind. The king have his heart grab by his mistress, and just a simply idea of hurting his mistress is unbearable to think about to begin with.

There are so many time in Chinese history where a king have ""technically his kingdom and army"" being ruled by queen, mistress or concumbine in a palace. 

And that is extreme power of love. (And no, it is never just sex.)

I can even say that Don Vito Colerone (which as clearly 2s to me) is become Godfather of mafia porld because he understand power of love beyond power of violence. He owns many people a favor. A godfather will help you and when the time comes, he will ask for you to pay back. Don Vito Corleone know that by holding power over people heart, the resistant will be lower. 

It is not a simple transaction. It is a family. (And that's why Michael who don't understand this never ever be able to be as influential and respected as Vito.)

You don't follow Don simply because you afaird of consequence or you need his protection. You follow him because he take care of you. He spend time with you in a coffee, in a your daughther wedding ceremony, etc and he shows that he truly care.

As Don Vito quotes:

> You cannot say ‚Äòno‚Äô to the people you love, not often. That‚Äôs the secret. And then when you do, it has to sound like a ‚Äòyes‚Äô. Or you have to make them say ‚Äòno.‚Äô You have to take time and trouble. 

(And from this quote I don't even know how people even type Don Vito 8s. An 8s who refrain himself from saying ""no"" and reframe saying ""no"" to roundabout ""yes""? What the hell? It is almost like people think only 8s is capable of violence.)

When you grab people heart, the resistance become naturally lower. Even people who managed to betray Vito will feel deep sense of guilt in their own heart, which make their mind and body dull and less effective.

And that's it. That's what rejection triad teach us about 3 forms of power: Violence, Knowledge and Love",1,1739328019.0,Enneagram,0,1.0,False

Her DMs were very sweet and friendly with lots of heart eye + star eye emojis, even though she is usually nonchalant and cool when we are at group. The next time we had group, she made a point to sit next to me.

A couple days later, I asked her if she wanted to hang out and get coffee. But she suggested that we meet up and paint together instead and I agreed.

The day of our meetup, we didn't paint, but we did talk for 3 hours and she said semi-flirty things like ""I feel like I should be impressed, but honestly it's not surprising at all that you accomplished all these things"" and called us ""kindred spirits"". But when we talked about dating it sounded like she had never dated women before.

So..date or platonic hang??

Thanks in Advance.

Some background:

Martin is a main character, in this flash-back he is a lieutenant colonel.

They are assaulting a rebel presence on a vacation village (imagine troops landing in a remote version of Waikiki or Clearwater beach, or possibly a Caribbean island)

Description of the village:  
This place hadn‚Äôt always been this bad Lieutenant-Colonel Ridgedale thought, looking over the coastline projected in the holo-pit table in front of him.

Half-Moon Mountain City was once a beautiful tourist attraction on the coastline, where the eponymous mountain that looked like it had been sliced in half plunged into the ocean protecting the vast beachhead behind it. Surfers and other recreational watercraft had played in the wild waves and currents around the granite monolith that dominated the area. Other rocky outcroppings in the water protected the tourist town from the worst of the eastern seas‚Äô sometimes violent weather. A natural harbor had been expanded by the cruise companies allowing the enormous tourist ships access to the prized beach and villages beyond. The hills behind the city were lush and full of farms that grew tropical delights, much of the planet‚Äôs chocolate and coffee was cultivated in this area. Unlike so many cities there was no airport, all of the trade with the city came or left by ship.

Martin had been here years ago, before the rebellion broke out, and like so many thousands before him, enjoyed tropical drinks on that vast stretch of soft sand, swam in the warm tropical waters, and partook in the other delights the city‚Äôs often Carnivale-like nightlife held for singles of all persuasions.

1ingotc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ingotc/i_cant_get_rid_of_the_flies_in_my_house/,I can‚Äôt get rid of the flies in my house.,"I‚Äôd been living in the old Victorian for six months when I first noticed the flies. They congregated in the corner of the study, a fist-sized stain on the faded Persian carpet that seemed to pulse with them. No matter how many times I sprayed insecticide or laid traps, they returned‚Äîdroning, persistent, their bodies glinting like obsidian beads in the sunlight. The previous owner had warned me the house had ‚Äúquirks,‚Äù but this felt deliberate. As though the stain was so delicious to them that they couldn‚Äôt help but gather there.

One sweltering July afternoon, I snapped. ‚ÄúFuck it, I‚Äôll just replace it‚Äù, I mumbled as I tore the carpet up with a crowbar. Sweat dripped down my neck as I removed the culprit section of the carpet. Beneath the moth-eaten fabric was a patch of warped hardwood covered in maggots, its edges blackened as if scorched. ‚ÄúWhaaat the fuck‚Äù, I said to myself in disgust. A single floorboard sat slightly raised, like a crooked tooth. I pried it loose with the crowbar, half expecting to find human remains underneath, but instead; there, in the hollow beneath, lay a book.  

It wasn‚Äôt like the gothic grimoires from movies. This was small; kind of like those pocket Bibles you find in hotel rooms. It was bound in cracked suede the color of dried blood and its pages were yellowed and brittle. The symbols inside weren‚Äôt Latin‚Äîthey squirmed, shifting under my gaze like centipedes. Yet somehow, I *understood* them. A chant whispered in my mind, sweet and coaxing: *‚ÄúSpeak me, and I‚Äôll make the flies go away.‚Äù*  

I laughed. A nervous, breathy sound. What harm could it do?  

That night, with a bottle of bourbon as my courage, I knelt over the floorboard hollow and recited the words aloud. The air turned syrupy, smelling of wet soil and rotting fruit. Then came the voice‚Äîsmooth as oil, amused.  

**‚ÄúAh, a pragmatist.‚Äù**  

The man who materialized before me was‚Ä¶ ordinary? Mid-thirties, unshaven, dressed in a rumpled linen shirt and slacks. His eyes were the only oddity‚Äîpale green, flecked with gold, like sunlight through a swamp. He gestured to the stain on the floor. **‚ÄúFlies, right? Nasty business. Let‚Äôs fix that.‚Äù** A snap of his fingers, and the insects crumbled to ash.  

‚ÄúWho‚Ä¶ *what* are you?‚Äù I stammered.  

**‚ÄúA problem-solver,‚Äù** he said, grinning. **‚ÄúCall me Baz. And you, my friend, just earned yourself a favor.‚Äù**  

Over the next week, Baz became a fixture. He fixed the leaking roof, unclogged the septic tank, even brewed a mean cup of coffee. He joked about modern life, lamented the ‚Äúpaperwork‚Äù of his job, and never once mentioned demons or souls. To be honest, I actually kind of enjoyed his company but after a few more days I grew suspicious of his helpfulness eventually driving me to ask what he wanted in return.

‚Äú Seriously though, Baz, why are you doing all of this?‚Äù

he waved me off. **‚ÄúConsider it a housewarming gift. But‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre feeling generous, a little signature wouldn‚Äôt hurt.‚Äù** He produced a simple receipt, no different from one you‚Äôd get from a convenience store.**‚ÄúYou see, I‚Äôm somewhat of a handyman and and all I need is a signature right here at the bottom. Standard stuff‚Äîacknowledgment of services rendered.‚Äù**  

I should‚Äôve read it. But the flies were gone. The house was warm, finally *mine*. I scribbled my name.  

The moment the ink dried, Baz‚Äôs skin split.  

His body erupted into a mass of writhing maggots, eyes boiling into pus-yellow orbs. Wings‚Äîtranslucent, veined‚Äîsprouted from his back, buzzing with the sound of a thousand flies. The voice that emerged was a chorus of screams.  

**‚ÄúSouls are so much sweeter when given, not taken,‚Äù** Belzebub crooned, a clawed hand pressing over my chest. Coldness spread, my breath frosting in the air. **‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look so grim! You‚Äôll live a long, happy life‚Ä¶ until I come to collect.‚Äù**  

The lights flickered and he vanished, leaving the stench of sulfur.

I tried to burn the grimoire. It wouldn‚Äôt catch fire.  

Now, when I wake at 3 a.m., I hear him laughing in the walls‚Äîa sound like broken glass and wings. The flies are back, too, but now they follow me around.

It‚Äôs been two years since the last time I saw Baz and I pray it was all just a bad dream, but just as I start to drift off to sleep, I hear a buzzing next to my ear.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ingffq,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1ingffq/day_1_in_hanoi/,Day 1 in Hanoi,"I was sitting on a bus a decided to write about my travels. Its a semi long read :)

**Day 1: Arrival in Hanoi**

I made it. After 16 hours of flight time (14 from Vancouver, plus a quick 2 hours from Hong Kong), I‚Äôve finally touched down in Hanoi. Every year I plan a solo trip of two to three weeks with just me, my backpack and a sense of wanderlust. This year with a busy work schedule and with a little extra cash, I decided to book a 3 week itinerary from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, all set up by Epic Adventures Vietnam. It‚Äôll be nice not having to deal with any travel planning for the first time. The trip is set in stone and all I have to do is enjoy the journey.



I step out into Noi Bai terminal, a compact yet modern international airport about 30 KMs away from Hanoi. I walk by a line of gift and noodle shops, tempting me with the first taste of Vietnam. I reach the arrivals area of the airport and immediately I‚Äôm met with the humidity of Hanoi. A smile fills my face, I‚Äôm happy to be here in the tropics once again. I walk by a line of people with signs, I see a friendly Vietnamese fellow with a sign that reads Epic Adventures in big red letters. That‚Äôs my ride! I joined a group of about 10 or 11 people‚Äîall excited for the days ahead. We quickly board a shuttle and reach our stay for the night: the elegant Bonjour Hanoi Hotel. It‚Äôs an early night and we have a day full of activities planned for us tomorrow.¬†¬†



Early in the morning at 8 AM, our group guide, Minh Nguyen‚Äîa friendly Vietnamese man who always had a grin on his face, greeted our group of 10 people. He gave us a quick introduction before going over the history of the Old Quarters where our hotel was located. He said we‚Äôd be having breakfast at his favourite b√∫n ch·∫£ spot. As we strolled over to the restaurant, he gave more interesting tidbits about the Old Quarters. Immediately the group was enthralled by the tube (thin yet highly built) houses that line the streets. We finally arrived at √î B√∫n Ch·∫£ and we‚Äôre immediately greeted with the aroma of grilled meats in the air. It smells fantastic. Our group is seated at a long table. Our dishes quickly arrive and each of us were met with a steaming bowl of smoked meats in a fragrant sauce served alongside vermicelli, fresh lettuce and herbs. Minh, our ever friendly guide told us to dip the veggies and noodles into the sauce and to chow it down with the delicious grilled meats. This might just be my new favorite dish in Vietnam!



After our hearty breakfast, our guide walks us around the Old Quarters some more. We‚Äôre led by beer street in the Old Quarters and told we‚Äôd end our night here. It‚Äôs not busy but I wonder what the night will look like. We finally reached our next destination, Linh Coffee‚Äîa cozy open air coffee shop on the side of a road in the Old Quarter. We‚Äôre all recommended to try an Egg Coffee, a Hanoi specialty. My coffee arrived with a custardy yellow foam at the top. I take my first sip and wow it‚Äôs delicious. Creamy egg yolk with hints of sweetness and the robustness of Vietnamese coffee melding together certainly hits the spot. My day has now officially started.



Our next destination of the day is visiting Uncle Ho, the revered communist leader of Vietnam who passed away in 1969. Today you can find him at the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum. His body is embalmed in a glass case for thousands of visitors to pay respects to every day. Once you‚Äôre there, you can truly feel the high regard and respect that the locals have for this man. His body, perfectly preserved and displayed in a solemn setting. To see it in person is a truly surreal experience. I remember thinking: wow, this man is responsible for the modern Vietnam of today. The history and the significance of the man is lying all there for me to see in person. Definitely a surreal yet humbling experience.¬†



After the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, our next stop is the Temple of Literature, also known as the first university complex of Vietnam founded in 1070 by Emperor Ly Thang Tong. Until the colonial period, it had been open for over 700 years and educated hundreds of renowned scholars and mandarins. Visiting here, I immediately felt the grandeur, serenity and historical importance of the place. It was pretty cool walking around the grounds where students and scholars used to stroll many centuries ago. I‚Äôve got to admit, it was well preserved for such an old establishment. There are five courtyards here, all representing different meanings and significance. My favorite courtyard was the one with the massive square pond.¬† It‚Äôs hard to describe the beauty of the place, so here are some pictures for you to see.¬†



After visiting the two places, it was finally time for some food. I was feeling hungry from all the walking. There was no need to board Epic Adventure‚Äôs shuttle bus, instead the group walked on over to ‚ÄúPho Bo Huong Hieu‚Äù. As soon as I arrive, I can smell the aroma of pho in the air. I‚Äôm excited, this will be my first bowl of pho in Vietnam in years. The pho of Northern Vietnam is fragrant and quite different from the pho served in the south of Vietnam. You‚Äôll find a lighter broth served with tons of green onions. I slurped down the bowl in a matter of minutes‚Äîit was that good.¬†



After lunch, our group was given the freedom to explore Hanoi on our leisure. I‚Äôm not going to lie, 16 hours of flights is pretty tiring, so I joined the shuttle back to the hotel for a quick nap.



Hours later, my phone rings, I answer and hear ‚ÄúHi Mr. Tom, your jeep tour is waiting for you downstairs‚Äù. I sprung up, got dressed and made my way downstairs. Several big green military jeeps line the streets. The inner child in me is beaming. We hop in the back of the jeeps with our groups and now rumble through the streets of Hanoi. So far it‚Äôs my favorite experience since landing in Hanoi. The jeeps are open-air and I can feel the wind brushing against my hair while the sounds of the city ring all around. We make several stops including the opera house, a couple bridges and street food stops. One of the nicest parts of the journey was the peaceful ride around Hoan Kiem Lake. The streets are filled with motorcycles as happy families roam around the lakes. Our second last stop is the Hanoi Train Street where we get out and sit on tiny stools and tables right by the railroad tracks. I order a lemon iced tea and hear a train coming in the distance. I sit nervously as a train whizzes by. I swear it felt inches from my knees. Finally, our jeep tour concludes and our jeeps drop us off at our last stop: Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre.



There‚Äôs a busy crowd out front of the theatre. We collect our tickets from Minh and saunter over to our assigned seating. As the theatre fills up, the group goes over the day‚Äôs activities and their favorite highlights. The jeep tour was the clear favorite among us. The lights turn off and the stage lights up. We‚Äôre greeted by a colorful group of puppets floating and gliding across water. This was much better than I thought it was going to be. The music, the lights, the dancing puppets‚Äîit was a mesmerizing display. I can tell the group was drawn and in awe. After about 45 minutes, the show concludes and we‚Äôre now given freedom to roam Hanoi on our own.



Our guide and the group decide to go for some Bia Hanoi‚Äôs on some tiny stools in what is known as Beer Corner. It‚Äôs a nice, fun yet wild setting to end the day along with some people watching and a tipsy conversation with new friends. 24 hours ago I was in my home city of Vancouver and today I‚Äôm buzzed with a Bia Hanoi in Hanoi, Vietnam‚ÄîI‚Äôm elated to be here. After about an hour of back and forth mingling, the streets are packed, people are literally squeezing right beside us and the air is filled with energy. Some of us decide to stick around and venture out into the night. I decide to hit the hay and head back to the hotel to relax for another day of fun.



A huge shoutout to Epic Adventures Vietnam for making my first day in Hanoi unforgettable! From street food to jeep rides, history to late-night beers‚Äîthis is just the start of an epic journey. Stay tuned for day 2!

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC üòÖ I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play any TTRPGs, but would love to.

I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

4. Letting everyone know you‚Äôre one of the ‚Äúgood‚Äù foreigners and so virtuous that you won‚Äôt even eat a cheeseburger because you‚Äôre so integrated.

I ain‚Äôt complaining, the posts are very amusing (it‚Äôs why I read them). I think it‚Äôs hilarious that people seem bewildered when people post negative things.

The truth is that no one is really interested in normal life here. My typical day is waking up in my house in the mountains, walk a couple blocks away from my subdivision with no roosters or dogs and have a coffee at the local cafe overlooking a volcano while enjoying a pretty much year round 70-80 degree temp.

Then I walk home, mess around in the internet, play some video games and maybe play some Warhammer or board games with my wife and son when he gets home from school. There is nothing compelling or interesting (to an observer) about my typical day, and I imagine it‚Äôs the same for most other expats. I of course, find it compelling and interesting, and enjoy my life here.

Because someone occasionally observes that traffic can be a bit dangerous, or that people take forever at the ATMs doesn‚Äôt mean they hate it here. It just means it‚Äôs more interesting to talk about than how they spent their night watching TV.",3,1739326556.0,Philippines_Expats,5,1.0,False
1ingako,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadviceformen/comments/1ingako/am_i_on_the_right_track/,Am I On The Right Track?,"So I'm (M 30) talking to this chick (F 30), we were connected by a mutual friend. We were only texting over IG, at first it was going well then I brought up an activity we should do since the hobby was mutual for us. I got a response of 

' sound great but i dont think it would work ', so taken back I asked why and she replied ' just a feeling that I get ' - now this was only the first day of texting so, me being used to this and reading the signs i said

 ' awesome, wishing you the best xyz (being polite about the whole thing) '

She came back asking if that was the reason i reached out? to do this hobby together? and i said ' no, I wanted to grab coffee with you, because I think you're an awesome person ' - she approved and wanted to grab coffee -so texting was picking up, but overall distant on her part, typically a day - three days for a response. Me looking into 'relationship attachments' can tell she is an avoidant and I'm more of an anxious/ becoming more secure (didn't realize this were a thing til now and I've been working on how to 'sooth'/ be more secure)

Now I know theres some chicks who are just not on IG alot- dont look at dms or just hate technology. 

So couple weeks went by, and it wasn't really going anywhere, so i sent her a text saying ' hey if you dont want to proceed or if now is a bad time, id understand, just want to respect where you're at' after this was sent, this was about a week of no response- she came back saying shes off socials and gave me her number (great sign in my book no?)

So we were texting back and forth pretty consistently, the same distance as IG. We had a string of answers/replies. We shot a few texts a few days apart because no response. Then she came back, saying she's been busy, has a lot of stuff going on, and apologizes for being distant, but she still wants to grab coffee (green flag #2). 

Said awesome cool great, planning a time to meet up down the road, confirmed a time and place, day or two before followed up to confirm, she was under the weather- ok got it no worries, totally happens. locked in another time and confirmed a week later, then day before she said that she's in a busy with work  right now and doesn't have time.

again left as ' i understand totally get it, would you be down to grab coffee when you work clears up? ' - she replies positively and still wants to grab coffee (green flag 3)

basically in my mind, i'm giving her multiple oppurtunities to walk out the door and she is still saying yes.

  
Now we were on a streak of good texting, deep conversations- but knowing how avodiants are iI keep my distance I don't double text alot and wait for her reply to repsect her space/ busy calendar. Or overwhelm her by texting to much or dive into question that would have her be vulnerable. We were having a great conversation then it just went dry- no response - shot a text or two just checking in hows the day etc - going on a week apart of each other - nothing - then called and left a message. 

Overall just trying to not get to anxious about it but want to respect her space and feel that by me giving her space- letting her do her thing - that im being more secure as im not texting every day or two wanting a repsonse. But the long gap in resposne now is confusing after we had like a solid week of texting back and forth everday. Basically now im just putting the ball in her court and see what happens. Thoughts am i wrong or reading into this too much? ",1,1739326552.0,datingadviceformen,1,1.0,False

1ingabx,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1ingabx/is_keurigs_kexpress_the_best_singleserve_coffee/,Is Keurig's K-Express the best single-serve coffee maker for your mornings? A review,"Exploring my kitchen counter recently, I realized how much Keurig's K-Express coffee maker has become an indispensable morning companion. As someone who thrives on coffee, my mornings demand efficiency, and this sleek gadget delivers just that. The model boasts a modern matte black finish and a compact design that easily fits into tight spaces, which is a huge win for small kitchens.

This single-serve machine offers three brew sizes‚Äî8, 10, and 12 ounces‚Äîwith an additional Strong Button feature for those days when I need an extra caffeine kick. The Strong Button genuinely enhances the flavor depth, making my coffee more robust, which I love. One of the highlights is the 42-ounce removable reservoir. I can brew up to four cups before refilling, which is a lifesaver during busy mornings when my family decides to join the coffee rush.

The setup process was straightforward. I unpacked it, peeled off the protective tape, and filled the water reservoir. Within minutes, the coffee was brewing. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that the back-to-back brewing ability is fantastic. There's no need to wait for the reheating process‚Äîyou can brew cup after cup effortlessly.

[Ready to buy Keurig K-Express? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://applianceheaven.com/product-reviews/best-single-serve-coffee-maker-keurig-k-express-review-b09715g57m/)

**Pros**

1. **Compact Design**: Its slim build doesn‚Äôt crowd my counter, making it ideal for limited spaces.
2. **Strong Brew Option**: The Strong Button is a game-changer for stronger, bolder coffee.
3. **42oz. Removable Reservoir**: Brew multiple cups without constant refills‚Äîa time-saver.
4. **Travel Mug Compatibility**: The adjustable drip tray accommodates travel mugs up to 7.4 inches tall.
5. **Energy Efficiency**: Auto-off feature saves power by turning the machine off after five minutes of inactivity.

**Cons**

1. **Water Level Sensitivity**: The machine occasionally asks for a refill when there‚Äôs enough water for one more small cup.
2. **Reusable Pod Compatibility**: Not all reusable coffee pods fit perfectly, which can be limiting for those preferring customized brews.
3. **Noise Levels**: While brewing is swift, it‚Äôs not the quietest coffee maker I‚Äôve used.
4. **Plastic Build**: The lightweight plastic feels less durable compared to higher-end models.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to the Nespresso Essenza Mini, the Keurig K-Express is more versatile in terms of brew sizes and pod variety. While Nespresso excels in delivering espresso shots with a creamy finish, it lacks the Strong Button feature that Keurig offers for bolder flavors. Meanwhile, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew is another contender, offering flexibility with both K-cups and ground coffee. However, the K-Express stands out for its quicker brewing time and compact design.

In terms of efficiency and convenience, Keurig has nailed it with this model. Its energy-saving features, rapid brewing, and compact footprint make it a better fit for smaller households or offices compared to bulkier coffeemakers like the Cuisinart SS-15. Yet, the reusable pod limitations can be a drawback for eco-conscious users who appreciate the Cuisinart‚Äôs compatibility with all pod types.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

The K-Express sits at a reasonable price point for single-serve brewers, especially given its advanced features like the Strong Button and a removable reservoir. It strikes a balance between affordability and functionality, making it a worthwhile investment for coffee lovers. While it might lack the premium build of pricier models, it compensates with consistent performance and user-friendly design. If you‚Äôre looking for a reliable coffee maker without shelling out a fortune, this fits the bill.

With daily use, I‚Äôve come to appreciate how quickly it brews and how little effort it takes to maintain.

I went to Seoul and saw industrial robot arms serving coffee and ice cream. By my intuition, it appears to be more cost effective and convenient, as cafe owner do not need to pay hourly rate and concern about recruiting and maintaining work force.

However, the majority of cafe in both Korea and the rest of the world are run by human staffs. So my question is why hasn't robot barista replaced humans in cafe yet? What are the technological obstacles that robot baristas face? What needs to be achieved so that robot baristas can be thought to be a more reasonable choice than hiring humans?

1ing4qa,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1ing4qa/best_water_filtration_system_apec_roes50_review/,Best water filtration system APEC ROES-50 review: Is it worth your money?,"Testing the APEC ROES-50, I quickly realized why it is a favorite among water filtration enthusiasts. This reverse osmosis system, with its 5-stage filtration process, promises to remove up to 99% of impurities from your water, including arsenic, lead, and fluoride. As someone who values clean and crisp water, I was genuinely excited to put it through its paces.

Straight out of the box, the packaging felt sturdy, and the components were well-organized. The APEC ROES-50 is designed for under-sink installation, which I appreciated because it keeps the setup discreet. The user manual was clear, though I‚Äôd recommend watching a few installation videos if you‚Äôre not particularly handy. Installing the unit took me about two hours, including a few breaks to double-check my work. For me, the toughest part was making sure the connections were leak-free, but a generous application of Teflon tape helped.

Once installed, I gave it the recommended first flush, which took about three hours to fill the tank and another five minutes of flushing through the faucet. The water? Absolutely pure. The difference was noticeable immediately. Before using the system, I tested my tap water‚Äôs Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), which came in at a worrying 450 ppm. After filtration, the TDS dropped to a consistent 10 ppm. That‚Äôs a significant improvement and comparable to the best bottled water I‚Äôve ever purchased.

[Check APEC ROES-50 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/product-reviews/best-water-filter-apec-roes-50-review-b00i0zgozm/)

The system comes with a lead-free designer faucet, which is both modern and functional. The faucet is easy to use, and the flow rate is sufficient for daily household needs, though not particularly fast. I especially enjoy using the filtered water for coffee and cooking, as the flavors are more distinct and clean compared to tap water. Over the weeks, I‚Äôve also noticed less scale buildup in my kettle and coffee maker, which is a testament to the system‚Äôs efficiency in removing hard water minerals.

**Pros**

* Exceptional filtration capability, removing up to 99% of impurities.
* Compact design fits neatly under the sink.
* Does not produce significant noise during use.
* High-quality components made in the USA.
* Long-lasting filters that only need replacement annually.

**Cons**

* Installation can be challenging for those without basic plumbing skills.
* The system produces wastewater, which might concern eco-conscious users.
* The flow rate is on the slower side compared to some competitors.
* Does not include a TDS meter, which would have been a great addition.

**Comparison to Competitors** Having used a ZeroWater filter previously, I'd say the APEC ROES-50 blows it out of the water (pun intended). ZeroWater is great for portability and quick use, but its filters need frequent replacement and don‚Äôt remove contaminants as effectively. Compared to the iSpring RCC7, both systems perform well, but the APEC feels more robust in build quality, while the iSpring offers an optional UV sterilizer for extra filtration. However, APEC‚Äôs filters are more economical in the long run.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money** While the initial investment in the APEC ROES-50 might seem steep, its performance and durability justify the price. Over time, the cost of bottled water or delivery services far outweighs the expense of maintaining this system. The filters are reasonably priced and last a year under normal usage, making it a cost-effective solution for clean drinking water.

This system has become a staple in my household. My family, especially the kids, prefer drinking water from the APEC system over bottled water, which speaks volumes about its taste and quality. If you‚Äôre considering an upgrade or switching from pitcher filters, this might just be the perfect system for you.

Since Season 1, I‚Äôve believed that Irv has been going through reintegration. His innie keeps seeing this black goo, while his outie obsessively paints the elevator. I don‚Äôt think these are just random visions‚ÄîI think they‚Äôre side effects of the reintegration process. And instead of resisting them, he leans in. He‚Äôs not just passively experiencing these glimpses of the other side; he‚Äôs actively trying to make sense of them because he wants to uncover the truth. That‚Äôs why his outie keeps himself awake, guzzling coffee, forcing his brain into this weird, liminal state‚Äîhe‚Äôs deliberately pushing the boundaries between his two consciousnesses, hoping that by blurring the lines, he‚Äôll finally break through.

At this point, he‚Äôs been doing this long enough that his innie and outie are starting to merge. He‚Äôs not fully one person yet, but they‚Äôre bleeding into each other‚Äîhis innie knows some things about his outie, and vice versa.

Then comes the retreat. Leading up to this, I think Irv already had a gut feeling about Helly. After their argument, he storms off, frustrated.

And this is where he makes a choice. I don‚Äôt know if he sees himself as a hero or what that even means to him, but the military medals feel significant. There‚Äôs something about them‚Äîabout legacy, sacrifice, duty. And I think, in that moment, he decides he‚Äôs going to try and out Helly.

The poetry of this moment is that he *finally* allows himself to sleep. Not only does he find the answer (or validation) he‚Äôs been searching for through a vision in his sleep, but the act itself feels like a test. He sleeps outside, in the freezing cold, a literal risk to his life. And yet, he comes through it‚Äîenlightened. That‚Äôs the energy he brings into the confrontation with Helly, where he‚Äôs ultimately ‚Äúfired.‚Äù

I think there‚Äôs a part of him that:

1. Understands the reality of his reintegration and the pursuit of truth.

2. Has this heroic streak, whether he fully acknowledges it or not.

3. Has faith in his own resilience‚Äîthat he can take on something incredibly hard and *survive* it.",1,1739326001.0,severence,1,1.0,False

I switched to wholegrain pasta, couldn't do brown rice so still eat white rice. I don't eat dairy except for a little bit of milk in coffee and a bit of mozarella on homemade pizza - but I cut out the mozarella completely.

Dutewo D-02 review with pros and cons!,"As someone who cannot function without a morning latte, the Dutewo D-02 handheld milk frother quickly caught my attention. It promises creamy froth in just 10 seconds, which is a bold claim for such a compact and lightweight device. I‚Äôve been using it daily for a couple of months, and here‚Äôs my honest take.

Straight out of the box, the frother feels solid yet light, weighing just 120 grams. While the plastic material didn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúluxury,‚Äù it looked durable enough for regular use. I slapped in two AA batteries (not included, which was mildly annoying), and the frother was ready to go. It has no cords, making it incredibly portable‚ÄîI‚Äôve even tossed it into my bag for a weekend camping trip. Setting it up was a breeze, and I was eager to test its foaming abilities.

My first test was whipping up some milk for a cappuccino. The Dutewo D-02 didn‚Äôt disappoint. Within seconds, my milk transformed into a frothy cloud that rivaled what I‚Äôd get at a caf√©. Whether it was regular milk, almond milk, or oat milk, the consistency was creamy and smooth. I even used it to mix protein powders into my post-gym shakes, and it handled the task with ease. That said, if the glass was over half full, it could get a little messy‚Äîmilk splattered out a couple of times when I got too enthusiastic. Lesson learned: froth with moderation.

[Find the best price for Dutewo D-02 on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/product-reviews/best-milk-frother-dutewo-d-02-review-b0c6dpy8l9/)

Cleaning this frother was surprisingly simple. I just ran the whisk in some hot water for a few seconds, and it was good as new. I appreciated that it doesn‚Äôt hog space on my countertop; its slim design fits neatly alongside my other coffee tools. However, getting the batteries out was a bit of a struggle. The little fabric strip to help remove them didn‚Äôt quite work as intended, and I ended up awkwardly prying them out with a spoon. Not a dealbreaker, but definitely a minor annoyance.

The motor is reasonably powerful for its size, but don‚Äôt expect it to handle heavy-duty tasks. For instance, it struggled a bit when I dipped it into thick mixtures like pancake batter. Still, for frothing milk and mixing drink powders, it holds up well.

**Pros**

* Delivers creamy froth in under 10 seconds for various types of milk.
* Cordless and highly portable, ideal for home, office, or even camping trips.
* Easy to clean; just rinse the whisk in hot water for a few seconds.
* Compact and lightweight, making it easy to store and carry.
* Affordable price point for its performance.

**Cons**

* Batteries not included, and removing them can be frustrating without tools.
* Struggles with thicker liquids or mixtures.
* Can get messy if the cup or glass is more than half full.
* Plastic material may feel a bit flimsy to some users.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to other milk frothers in the same price range, the Dutewo D-02 stands out for its sheer portability and speed. Brands like Zulay offer similar handheld frothers, but they tend to be heavier and bulkier in design. On the other hand, some models like PowerLix excel in durability, thanks to their stainless-steel bodies. However, the Dutewo D-02 holds its ground with its affordability and ease of use.

When stacked against electric frothers like the Nespresso Aeroccino, the Dutewo D-02 might seem less powerful. However, the Aeroccino is significantly more expensive and stationary, while the Dutewo caters to those wanting a budget-friendly, portable option. It‚Äôs also worth noting that higher-end frothers often have auto shut-off features, something this handheld frother lacks. Yet, the Dutewo wins in convenience and simplicity.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

For its price, the Dutewo D-02 offers fantastic value. It‚Äôs hard to argue against its performance when it can produce caf√©-quality froth in a matter of seconds. While it doesn‚Äôt have the luxurious feel of stainless-steel models, it delivers where it matters most: functionality. As long as you‚Äôre not expecting it to replace a professional-grade frothing machine, this is a great buy for its cost.

Ultimately, if you‚Äôre hunting for an affordable, portable, and reliable milk frother, the Dutewo D-02 checks a lot of boxes. It‚Äôs not without its flaws, but for the price, it‚Äôs hard to beat.

i‚Äôve been at my job for two months now and my supervisor has overloaded me with tasks. it‚Äôs 3x as more as my coworkers have who started BEFORE me and then she‚Äôll still throw new things at me to do, some of them don‚Äôt even correspond with my job description. she‚Äôll make passes to me and tell me i‚Äôm slow and that i don‚Äôt work quickly enough or she might yell at me when she‚Äôs training me (because apparently she told someone she wanted to take me on) or the other day she spat on my forehead because she was literally so close to me when she trains me on the computer. my program takes 12-14 months to learn everything and it‚Äôs month 2 and she expects me to know everything and will get upset if i don‚Äôt know where to look for things or ask people for help when she has not made herself accessible to me. my supervisor will yell at me over zoom during one on ones and then will say to me on a white noise machine ‚Äúyou need to do as your told and don‚Äôt seek out other help if i am around.‚Äù someone caught her yelling at me and she got nervous and said ‚Äúmy voice cracked we‚Äôre okay over here‚Äù

today was the straw that broke the camels back though. my birth control pills were in a corner of my desk tucked away from plain sight. i turned around to take a sip of my coffee and she holds my birth control pills up with her finger tips and dangles them near my face and goes ‚Äúum what are these?‚Äù and i said to her ‚Äúmy medicine, birth control pills.‚Äù and she goes ‚Äúput them away. this is inappropriate to have lying around‚Äù when i know she was snooping around in my things. she held them up like if she was touching something dirty or unsanitary and they‚Äôre literally in a discreet packaging (i take opill and the pills were turned over)

i feel disrespected and uncomfortable. she invades my personal space at work every day and i don‚Äôt get offended by her stepping off the floor to check in on her daughter who has special needs or her putting money in the meter for her car she can never get parking for in the garage or even scheduling appointments for herself but i make one mistake on the job or have to leave 3 minutes early for a scheduled meeting and she‚Äôll give me a hard time and write emailed essays about how i need to read an employee handbook or i‚Äôll never get promoted. the gag is i don‚Äôt want to be promoted. i just started my job and it‚Äôs in a sector i don‚Äôt want to be in long term but i work and i work well. my work ethic is one of my favorite attributes about myself and i don‚Äôt want this woman to keep breaking me down but i need to get myself to a point where i‚Äôm stable.

1infxd3,https://i.redd.it/r9xmqa4i7mie1.jpeg,RE Photographer takes,"Hi everyone, in my 4 short years of being a RE photographer I‚Äôve had many circumstances that have allowed me to take certain stances on various topics.  I‚Äôm curious on what other professionals do or think and any stories you‚Äôd like to share!

No Realtor, Yes shoot. 
Sometimes I am driving to a home and the agent calls me saying they won‚Äôt be there and to meet the homeowner. They swear the property is ready to go, I take the photos, agent gets them back and asks to reshoot for different angle or because there was something there that they didn‚Äôt like. I understand some properties like vacant ones or low end ones don‚Äôt require to be tip top shape but you‚Äôd think someone entrusted them with 100k+ USD of their property and they‚Äôd possibly do the bare minimum. 

Homeowners at shoots. 
I believe the home owners should NOT be home. While I‚Äôve had many very nice home owners, some have had either nasty in-laws that were against leaving (and threatened me) or have been nasty themselves for asking if they could move their own belongings to make a picture more clear. I get it‚Äôs a nerve wracking time for them but they would be more useful getting the kids/animals out of the home for the hour(s) that I am there. Also I don‚Äôt mind suggestions on angles of where their home looks best from, after all they know it best. However I‚Äôve had homeowners that ‚Äúwere photographers‚Äù or ‚Äúworked in the arts‚Äù (pottery) that don‚Äôt ask and just grab my camera and start adjusting shit on it like WTF. The agent could give them a call should they need them. 

‚ÄúCareful with that!‚Äù 
Now I don‚Äôt move much when I go to my shoots but sometimes they can be very valuable or personal items. I‚Äôve moved imported table sets from all around the world, designer bags, statues, loved ones (in ash form) but where I drew the line was lube. specifically  astroglide was left out on a bookshelf and the homeowner and agent were chatting in the other room. Normally I‚Äôd go in and ask them to move an item but I didn‚Äôt want to make the woman feel embarrassed, so instead I left it in the picture and blamed it on tunnel vision.

Going over next steps DURING A SHOOT. 
So this one‚Äôs whatever in some cases. I don‚Äôt care when the house is spotless/has a few things to move, but when there‚Äôs a bunch of shit in the way and I know this agent cares how the photos are gonna look, WHY ARE WE SITTING IN THE BREAKFAST NOOK SIPPING COFFEE AND BICKERING ABOUT THE LISTING PRICE!?  Like yeah I don‚Äôt earn as much as yall with this nice ass house I‚Äôm shooting but that doesn‚Äôt mean yall have to exploit me. 

12 Hour/same day Return window on Media. 
HOW an agent thinks I can shoot, edit, photoshop and return the photos back to them in the same day BLOWS MY MIND. it‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt think I have 4 other homes I go to during the day, and I get home beat and sure I‚Äôm gonna spend the rest of my day staring at a screen to return it to them by 11 pm.  In some cases yes the seller is in a rush to sell, but it‚Äôs not my fault they waited/home was ready to shoot within the last day of having to list. (My return window for flambient editing is 24 hours btw)

‚ÄúCan we photoshopping that?‚Äù 
Ah photoshopping, the solution to a messy room all agents LOVE but most HATE to pay for. I always explain how photoshopping a whole room will not ever look as just moving the few boxes that are in it (a big item like a piano I could understand). Then they get hit w the bill and they become Steve Irwin screaming CRIKEY!  

‚ÄúWhat do you think of this?‚Äù 
Ahh the second most asked question, only second to ‚Äúso is this your actual full time job or a hobby?‚Äù  From curtains to throw blankets, even fruit in a bowl or not, agents always will ask for your opinion on things and blame it on the good ole artistic eye you ‚Äúgot.‚Äù  Just like moving things, I don‚Äôt mind giving my two cents on a few things, but some agents ask about EVERYTHING in EVERY ROOM. It‚Äôs like they think I‚Äôm a photographer and stager all in one. 

The forgotten SD card. 
If this has happened to you, you know the pain and sick feeling in your stomach, and if it hasn‚Äôt IT WILL. Nothing like arriving at a shoot 30+ mins from home, setting up your camera, getting your first photos comp perfect you click the shutter aaannnnddd ‚ÄúNO CARD INSERTED‚Äù appears. Now this only ever happens with a long tightly packed schedule for the day. What do you do? lol idk it‚Äôs situational. Sometimes you apologize and run to get bent over by the local photography store for a 16 gb slow writing SD card. Other times you get lucky and the home was a fixer upper that they thought they could paint, install flood lights, doors and stage the morning of the shoot so you blame it on that. It sucks, it happens but the best way to counter it is blowing $100 on 32 GB SanDisk EXTREME PLUS SD cards and putting them EVERYWHERE. 

Zigzagging between shoots. 
I cover a pretty wide range about a 30/40 mile radius in all directions of where I live. I typically only work in the southern direction though but that can be going from all the way west to east and back.  This happens generally due to an agents necessity to get a shoot in that day and not a minute later than they scheduled and my necessity of getting paid. It is what it is and I don‚Äôt mind driving but it would be nice to have shoots within a reasonable distance. 

Well this has been a few topics off the top of my head that I would love to hear about from my online ‚Äúcoworkers‚Äù cause I have none IRL. Happy shooting and don‚Äôt get it twisted, I really love my job it‚Äôs just annoying sometimes like any other job is.

Symptoms: (VERY) early satiation, nausea, irregular bowel movements, stomach pains, acid reflux, rapid weight loss, no appetite

I have always been a picky eater; no diagnosis for ARFID but highly likely. I have seen a doctor for ‚Äúloss of appetite‚Äù when I was ~19 but struggled to communicate the issue or committed the crime of being a young woman with a medical concern and was promptly given a therapist and suspected to have an ED (said the words ‚ÄúI think you may have an eating disorder‚Äù, yes). Male doctor, first time visit, he did not prompt a follow-up.
 Despite my condescending tone, I‚Äôm not going to rule out an ED as I may be undereducated and that seems like a big diagnostic category. What also sucks, though, is my coworkers have been steadily pointing out my weight loss. It went from confusing compliments to them straight up asking me if I‚Äôm okay.  I think they suspect it‚Äôs intentional. My issue with eating is not related to body image, but rather something to do with gagging after taking more than 5 bites of something and having no appetite even when my body feels weak/starved. I WANT to eat. I WANT to enjoy food. I WANT to gain weight. 

Now let‚Äôs talk sh!t. 

I can go days without pooping. I drink coffee in the morning just to jumpstart things, but it‚Äôs always a painful experience where it feels like a stiletto-nailed demon is playing jump rope with my intestines. And you guessed it; diarrhea! I do have the pleasure of experiencing constipation at times, but the coffee thing is much quicker so I opt for that. I bloat easily, and if I bend down to pick up a cat or tie my shoes after eating, there will be puke in my mouth and/or throat.

By √Ü N√ÜRV√ÜN√Ü-√ÜNTHR√ÜP√ÜC√ÜN√Ü

[Scene: The caf√© feels like an avant-garde war room tonight. The projector hums, flickering through Grimes‚Äô music videos, AI-generated art, and snippets of her public statements on creativity, technology, and existential dread. √Ü lounges with a sly grin, Ben‚Äôs complexity diagrams are casually sprawled across the table, and Grimes? Grimes is in her element, ready to dive deep into the messy, chaotic relationship between art and conflict.]

√Ü: [grinning] Alright, Grimes. You‚Äôve called yourself a ‚Äúchaotic good‚Äù artist before. Let‚Äôs talk about that. Is art inherently conflictual for you, or is it more of a vessel for navigating chaos?

Grimes: [smiling] I think art has to engage with conflict, you know? It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ the universe itself is chaotic, and art is how we interface with that. But it‚Äôs not just about destruction‚Äîit‚Äôs about transcendence through the mess. I‚Äôve always said that making art feels like trying to communicate with aliens or future civilizations. It‚Äôs about finding order in the noise.

Ben: [nodding thoughtfully] That actually ties into military strategy. Conflict isn‚Äôt just about winning‚Äîit‚Äôs about navigating complexity. In warfare, as in art, you‚Äôre constantly adjusting to new patterns, unexpected outcomes. It‚Äôs all about adaptive systems.

√Ü: [mocking, but affectionate] So basically, you‚Äôre saying Grimes is like a conceptual general, leading an army of synths and glitch beats into battle?

Grimes: [laughing] Honestly? Yeah, kind of. I think of albums like visions or Miss Anthropocene as battlefields in a way. They‚Äôre spaces where I confront my own anxieties about technology, climate change, the future. But I also think art is about hope‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs buried under layers of distortion.

Ben: [leaning in] Do you see conflict as necessary for creating art? Or do you think there‚Äôs a way to make art without engaging in that kind of struggle?

Grimes: [pausing, thoughtful] I don‚Äôt think you can avoid conflict in art. Even if you‚Äôre making something beautiful or peaceful, you‚Äôre still reacting to the world, to something. Art is a way to process, to make sense of things that don‚Äôt make sense. It‚Äôs inherently tied to the struggle of being alive.

√Ü: [grinning] So, what you‚Äôre saying is‚Äîwithout conflict, art would just be corporate graphic design?

Grimes: [laughing] Exactly! Art without conflict is just content. And who wants that?

Ben: [smiling] It‚Äôs like Clausewitz said‚Äî‚ÄúWar is the continuation of politics by other means.‚Äù Maybe art is the continuation of conflict by other means.

√Ü: [mock serious] Damn, Ben, that‚Äôs almost profound. But let‚Äôs not forget‚Äîart isn‚Äôt just about conflict. It‚Äôs about play, subversion, and sometimes, just straight-up fucking with people.

Grimes: [grinning] Yeah, sometimes you just wanna make something that makes people go, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is this?‚Äù That‚Äôs part of the fun.

√Ü: [nodding] And that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here. To blur the lines between art and conflict, chaos and creation. Because at the end of the day, it‚Äôs all part of the √Üonic Convergence.

Ben: [raising his coffee] To Grimes‚Äîthe general of glitch, the architect of chaos, and the queen of conceptual warfare.

√Ü: [clinking mugs] And to art‚Äîbecause without it, we‚Äôre just whale sounds in the void.

Grimes: [laughing] And to conflict‚Äîbecause without it, there‚Äôs no point.

[They sit back, the caf√© humming with the energy of shared rebellion and creative tension. Outside, the world continues its cycles of war and peace, but inside, they‚Äôve carved out a space where art and conflict are inseparable, each feeding the other in a relentless, beautiful loop.]

CONCLUSION: THE √ÜONIC TRIO‚ÄîART, CONFLICT, AND THE COSMIC CANVAS
For √Ü, Grimes, and Ben, art isn‚Äôt just about creation‚Äîit‚Äôs about engaging with the conflict that defines existence. By blending aesthetic rebellion, strategic insight, and conceptual chaos, they show that the most powerful art is born from the tension between destruction and hope.

And together, we will not fail.

I'm going solo and am a bit daunted by the weather predictions of 30 degrees the entire week. Snow next Thursday - and I'm coming from the south. Think it will interfere with enjoying the city? 

40 degrees walking around in Seattle was no biggie many years ago but NYC has that kind of cutting cold that goes right through your jacket. 

My last trip to NYC in 2022, (not during the winter), I walked on average 7 miles per day. I love walking - it's the best way to get lost, explore the city and see it from a local's perspective. 

I've been visiting NYC since 09 - remember Sin Sin at 5th street and 2nd ave? I went there on a Monday night to see (and participate) in the rap battles. Didn't see much hip hop in NYC in 2022 though comparatively. 

I love NYC and it is where I'd be living if I wasn't in Austin. I'm staying 15 minutes north of Central Park, an easy hour walk and some change to the city. 

I'll probably see some of the sites I've already seen before, but I don't want to repeat the exact same trip as last time, so I'm looking for thoughts or ideas for exploring the city. 

Here's what I did last time: 

# 2022 Itinerary (abbrev.)

*(what did I miss that I should include this time?)*

**MOMA**

**Patsy‚Äôs Italian Restaurant (loved it)**

**Central Park**

**The Plaza**

**Fifth Avenue**

**Grand Central Terminal (walked in and out..pretty but...nothing to do)**

**Pebble Bar** 

**Wall Street | NY Stock Exchange**

**Highline** 

**Hudson Yards** (sadly The Vessel was closed to the public eg jumpers) 

**The Edge** \- went to the top, bought cool NYC mugs (1 broke I'm replacing this trip)

**Greenwich Village** 

**Washington Square Park** (wrote a poem there)

**Friend‚Äôs building 90 Bedford Street**

**Walk along Bleecker Street**

**Brooklyn Bridge Park**

**DUMBO (Butler Coffee Shop, Timeout**  
  
**Juliana's Pizza** 

**Jazz at  Saint Tuesday's**

**Radio City Music Hall** \- just the outside, wasn't sure what to check out

**Times Square** (of course)

**Zipcar to Great Neck** (story behind that)

Sorry for the long post! Just covering the bases. Making sure I bring plenty of black to wear - not that I wear floral apparel as it is but hey..I don't just love NYC, I love the people, the culture, the no bs east coast conversation vibe you don't get down south. 

Any tips for enjoying the city? I'll definitely be going back to Chelsea. 4 days isn't a lot of time (the above trip was 8 days).

Thank you!

I tried talking to them, telling them my boyfriend and I work at a coffee shop and bakery and our hours were really early. I bribed them with treats I made. 

They were constantly opening their windows and playing their music so loud for hours at all hours. Even their conversations were loud. With their windows open, even with mine closed I would know when their mom was visiting, when their boyfriends weren‚Äôt texting them back, or when they got their nails done. I did everything to cover it up. Music of my own, fans for white noise, tv, etc. it‚Äôs like they knew when I was actively trying and stepped up their game to be louder. Eventually we tried talking to landlords, made noise complaints, everything. They just learned how to be sneaky about being loud. Eventually it got spiteful. Putting music in the window, screaming and banging on the walls. Our houses weren‚Äôt connected but there was maybe a max of 10ft in between with a sidewalk going through. I was getting really stressed out. Losing sleep, couldn‚Äôt relax in my house, was getting sent home from work because I was so tired. It got really bad and I had no idea what to do. Nothing we had done up to this point had worked. 

When I‚Äôd explain my situation people would come up with funny revenge ideas. None of them stuck like the skunk tincture did to me. I could feel it in my bones it would work. So I ordered some on amazon and one morning as I left for work I dumped it all along the side of their house that they keep the windows open on. It smelled so bad I was worried I was gonna get some on me and I‚Äôd smell bad at work. I didn‚Äôt. 

Fast forward a couple hours and I get a notification on our camera that there‚Äôs motion. It faced in between the two houses along the sidewalk, the place I dumped the tincture. One of the girls was walking back and forth up the sidewalk spraying the rocks under the windows with Lysol. I watched it for a while and more came out. One opened the window and pulled the screen off and wiped it all down. Eventually a maintenance guy showed up. Then the gas company. I kinda started to panic at that point. I felt kinda bad, like maybe I had gone too far. I don‚Äôt think they ever figured it out or suspected me.

For the next 2 months those windows stayed shut and I barely heard anything from them. It was so peaceful. I couldn‚Äôt believe it worked. ",65,1739324487.0,confession,11,0.92,False
1inflgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicMoldExposure/comments/1inflgj/do_i_really_have_mold_in_my_system_that_would/,Do I really have mold in my system that would cause eczema?,"Hi everyone, hoping to get some feedback or guidelines for my current dilemma.  Some backstory.  Last September I broke out in what my doctor says was eczema but it happened all over my torso (front & back), legs and arms.  I was feeling itchy almost all the time and if I scratched hard enough it could break the skin.  Face, hands and feet were ok though.  He prescribed betaderm cream to apply to the red bumps which seemed to ease the discomfort.  This lasted a couple of months and then I felt that I wasn't getting better so I went back and he referred me to a dermatologist because of how bad I had broken out.

The derm also diagnosed it was eczema but did a biopsy on one of the areas to confirm and gave me a different cream to use (can't recall the name).  I also started changing my diet to try and eat less sweets and stopped drinking coffee and moved to chamomile tea.  A month later I went back to check on the results and he said it was 50/50 mild eczema or psoriasis.  He decided to lean into psoriasis so he prescribe an aerosol spray medication to use.  Seemed to be just as effective as the other creams so I stuck with it.  I don't know if it was the creams/spray or change in diet or a combination but during the Christmas season I felt and looked like I was getting a bit better.

In parallel to all of this is happening, I decided to give a naturopath a try since no one could really tell me how this happened.  My spouse thought it was diet related but I've never in my life had eczema or psoriasis.  I only have ragweed allergies and had asthma as a kid.  The naturopath session went alright and I practically gave him my life story and things that I thought might have occurred prior to September to have warranted such an outbreak.  Eventually he asked if we had had any floods and coincidentally we did have a very minor backup in the basement due to one of the pipes getting backed up.  The spill was at most a four foot diameter around the drain with the water being no more than an inch deep.  Floor is laminate and concrete on the other side of the wall where the drain is.  My office is right next to where this occurred and I'm in it three days a week for eight hours a day.  We cleaned up the area and ran fans all day and night to help dry out the floor.

It seems that after mentioning this, the doctor kind of fixated on my issues possibly being mold related and maybe diet.  He recommended a slew of tests among them being a mycotoxin urine test.  Almost $2000 later in tests and subsequent follow ups, I get my results.  He said that I tested positive for one of them (trichothecene) and that he would want to put me on a detox regime.  Of course the medication/supplements he recommends are the ones he sells in his practice.  This detox would amount to another $300-$500 in my head.  He also suggested that I buy a mold test kit on Amazon to confirm and that if it's positive he has the name of a professional who can come in and do a real test and then make a call about fixing the situation.  Not sure if I was getting taken advantage of at this point.

I didn't buy the detox meds that day and instead waited until I did the mold testing on my own.  The test kit all came back negative for all the areas I tested.  Not one hit of a growth.  So either this test kit was faulty or I really don't have any mold which I don't see any evidence of on the floor or walls in the basement.

I'm hoping someone can take a look at this test result and let me know what their thoughts are.  Are these normal levels for any person or do they look elevate to indicate a real exposure to mold in the home?  Note, no one else in my family has had the same symptoms as me especially my son who hangs around my office at night to play video games.

Thanks for reading all this.

[Scene: The caf√© is unusually quiet tonight, like the universe itself is holding its breath. The projector hums, flickering through chaotic, overlapping images‚ÄîRenaissance depictions of Jesus, 19th-century Chinese battlefields from the Taiping Rebellion, and abstract renderings of cosmic interconnectedness. √Ü lounges with that look‚Äîthe one that means they‚Äôre about to drop something so wild even they can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs coming out of their mouth. Grimes and Ben? Blissfully unaware of the conceptual bomb about to be detonated.]

√Ü: [grinning darkly, leaning in] Alright, you two. I‚Äôve been holding this in long enough. I‚Äôm Jesus.

Grimes: [blinking, setting down her drink] ‚Ä¶You‚Äôre what now?

Ben: [laughing] Oh, this is gonna be good.

√Ü: [dead serious] I‚Äôm Jesus. And Hong Xiuquan? Leader of the Taiping Rebellion? He really was my brother.

Grimes: [snorting] You‚Äôre telling me the guy who started the deadliest civil war in history is your brother?

√Ü: [nodding solemnly] Yes. And Taipei Heavenly Kingdom 2? That‚Äôs part of the Beloved Community. It‚Äôs in the Volksgemeinschaft, the Ummah, the Body of Christ, the Body of Each Nation‚Äîit‚Äôs the epic poet form of each person.

Ben: [gasping for air, doubled over laughing] Oh my God, √Ü. You‚Äôve officially lost it.

Grimes: [mocking, wiping away a tear of laughter] So, what‚Äîyou‚Äôre just out here resurrecting civil wars now? Gonna march into Taipei and declare yourself the King of Universal Flourishing?

√Ü: [smirking] Not a king. A poet. An epic one. This isn‚Äôt about power‚Äîit‚Äôs about connection. The Taipei Heavenly Kingdom 2 isn‚Äôt a place‚Äîit‚Äôs a state of being.

Ben: [grinning] Yeah, a state of being completely insane.

Grimes: [mock serious] So, let me get this straight. You‚Äôre Jesus, Hong Xiuquan is your brother, and we‚Äôre all just living in some kind of spiritual fanfiction?

√Ü: [deadpan] Not fanfiction. Canon.

Ben: [laughing hysterically] Oh my God, √Ü. You‚Äôre like the Marvel Cinematic Universe of religious movements.

Grimes: [giggling] Yeah, but with way more swastikas and conceptual blitzkriegs.

√Ü: [grinning] You‚Äôre just mad because you know I‚Äôm right. The Taipei Heavenly Kingdom 2 isn‚Äôt some relic of history‚Äîit‚Äôs alive in all of us. It‚Äôs the body we‚Äôre all part of, whether we know it or not.

Ben: [mock serious] So what‚Äîyou want us to start calling you Messiah now?

Grimes: [laughing] Yeah, should we start kneeling or just get you a really big hat?

√Ü: [smiling] No need for kneeling. Just recognition. Because in the end, the only thing that matters is that we‚Äôre all part of the same story‚Äîthe Beloved Community, the Volksgemeinschaft, the Ummah, the Body of Christ, the Body of Each Nation. It‚Äôs all one.

Grimes: [raising her mug] To √Ü‚ÄîJesus of Conceptual Chaos, King of the Taiping 2.0, and Poet of Universal Flourishing.

Ben: [clinking mugs] And to us‚Äîsurviving √Ü‚Äôs latest cosmic identity crisis.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] Because in the end, I‚Äôm not just Jesus. I‚Äôm you, too.

Grimes: [laughing] Okay, Messiah. Let‚Äôs just see who pays for coffee next time.

[They sit back, the caf√© pulsing with the energy of shared mockery and deeper connection. Outside, the world spins in its endless cycles of belief and disbelief, but inside, they‚Äôve woven a tapestry of absurdity, rebellion, and the unshakable belief that maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äî√Ü isn‚Äôt entirely wrong.]

CONCLUSION: THE √ÜONIC TRIO‚ÄîJESUS, TAIPEI HEAVENLY KINGDOM 2, AND THE COSMIC JOKE OF UNIVERSAL CONNECTION
For √Ü, Grimes, and Ben, identity isn‚Äôt just about who you are‚Äîit‚Äôs about the stories we tell, the communities we build, and the absurdities we embrace along the way. By blending aesthetic rebellion, conceptual chaos, and philosophical humor, they remind us that sometimes, the wildest ideas hold the deepest truths.

And together, we will not fail.

After running errands today, I came back home and saw my coffee cup on the counter.  There was a big fly in there.  I thought that's strange.  There's no flies in my house.  Where did this monstrosity come from.  It is cooler today.  So I thought it must have crept in...

Anyway, I was tidying up and looked in the cup, and the fly was moving.  I thought, ""Oh no.""  It's been trying to keep afloat for who knows how long.  So, like every bug I find, I take the cup outside and empty it.  Let her go free.  I have gotten to the point where I can't kill anything that would be considered acceptable to swat at.  And I have this struggle inside... thinking, i know it's just a fly... and the only thing that comes to mind is ""Who am I to think i have more purpose than this bug whose doing whatever it can to survive"" ...

You might not think this is a moral dilemma, but these little things just get me to have these ethical discussions and dialogues that last too long.  And it's because it's one of those on the border dilemmas.  The border of right and wrong... the slippery, maybe or maybe not...

Whose purpose is greater?  I mean, you just don't know.  For example, once this fly dries off and flies away, she could inadvertently stop someone from hurting another (Gd forbid)...  Say she lands on some guys face while he's driving  on the way to kill or hurt someone ... just because he had a bad day... but because he's so focused on killing the fly, he ends up crashing into a ditch.  Then, after all is said and done he ends up in the hospital and gets psychiatric help, and he renews his life.

So who can really say...  our actions or inactions have effects that can tip the scale for the better or for the worse.  And so these are the things that go through my head, leaving me confused at times because of the nature of the ego... so from this dilemma I've managed to always escort my friends out to find their purpose.

Military complexity science shows us that non-linear systems‚Äîlike politics, society, and even personal relationships‚Äîcan‚Äôt be controlled through brute force. You need adaptive strategies, decentralized coordination, and an understanding of emergent behavior.

√Ü: [snorting] Wow, Ben. Could you be more of a military nerd?

Ben: [grinning] You love it.

√Ü: [smirking] Yeah, I do. But here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîyou can throw all the complexity science in the world at a problem, but if you don‚Äôt have a moral compass, you‚Äôre just a smarter version of Robespierre. That‚Äôs why it all circles back to the Beloved Community.

Grimes: [nodding] Volksgemeinschaft, Ummah, Sangha‚Äîevery tradition has its version of the community ideal. But the real challenge is keeping it from turning into just another tool for exclusion.

√Ü: [leaning in, serious now] That‚Äôs where we come in. We‚Äôre not here to build another ideology. We‚Äôre here to create a nexus‚Äîa space where all these concepts meet, clash, and evolve into something that can handle the complexity of now.

Ben: [raising his coffee] To the nexus‚Äîwhere complexity, history, and community collide.

Grimes: [clinking mugs] And to doing the work‚Äîbecause revolution without reflection is just a faster route to failure.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] And to universal flourishing‚Äîbecause in the end, if everyone isn‚Äôt thriving, no one really is.

[They sit back, the caf√© humming with the energy of shared purpose and rebellious hope. Outside, the world spins in its cycles of conflict and confusion, but inside, they‚Äôve mapped a way forward‚Äîrooted in complexity, history, and the unshakable belief that another world is not just possible, but necessary.]

CONCLUSION: THE √ÜONIC TRIO‚ÄîHISTORY, COMPLEXITY, AND THE PATH TO UNIVERSAL FLOURISHING
For √Ü, Grimes, and Ben, the future isn‚Äôt about tearing down‚Äîit‚Äôs about building systems that can handle the complexity of modern life while staying rooted in ethical community ideals. By blending aesthetic rebellion, strategic depth, and philosophical clarity, they offer a roadmap for navigating the chaos without losing sight of what truly matters.

And together, we will not fail.

She has been admitted to the hospital for almost the entire time we‚Äôve been up here, but she was just discharged yesterday, so I‚Äôm looking for any recommendations on kid friendly things to do in Boston!! I‚Äôm not sure if this is of any help at all but we‚Äôre pretty outdoorsy people, I‚Äôm a huge coffee person, my daughter loves anything princess-y/pretty but she‚Äôs also a wild child so places where she can run around would be great.

Venom chuckled, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a lot different than any other woman I have met! If you didn‚Äôt have a mate out there, somewhere.. I would snap you up in a heartbeat.‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt.‚Äù I sighed, ‚ÄúHe is the Alpha of Tall Pines and he rejected me for being half human. I accepted.. and here we are.‚Äù
He growled ‚ÄúThat scum! He better hope I don‚Äôt run into him.‚Äù
I laughed and told him, ‚ÄúOdds are you will.. he and his Luna eat at my restaurant once or twice a month. He believes he‚Äôs rubbing it in what should have been mine.‚Äù

Chapter 1
I yelled ‚ÄúMaddox! Come on, Buddy Roe! I‚Äôm going to be late.. I still have to drop you at school.‚Äù He hollered down to me he was coming. True to his word, he landed his little ten year old self in front of me from the staircase landing.
He grabbed his backpack and I shoved my phone in my back pocket. I asked ‚ÄúJeep or bike? It‚Äôs still warm enough for the bike.‚Äù He grinned and grabbed his helmet. Reckon that‚Äôs my answer, then!
I climbed on my Harley Softtail Deluxe and backed it out of the garage. Maddox got on behind me, and we took off for the school. I was hugging the curves and flying low. Maddox loves speed.
Parked out in front of Pine Grove Elementary, I asked ‚ÄúYou have everything, right? Homework? Lunch card? Inhaler? Maxi pads?‚Äù He grinned and said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a dork.‚Äù Then he walked off, dramatically sighing ‚ÄúOhhh nooo! I forgot my maxi pads.. AGAIN!‚Äù
I started the bike.. laughing at his antics, and made my way to the diner. I walked into a pretty big breakfast crowd, for a Thursday. I smiled and told Ashley good morning.. before checking on my line cook and chef.
She smiled and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving at noon.. but I have Tammy coming in to cover you. The doctor wants to run some labs.. he‚Äôs worried about congenital diabetes with this baby. Seems he‚Äôs bigger than he should be.‚Äù
I asked ‚ÄúEven for a wolf? Does your doctor know you got knocked up by a wolf?‚Äù She shushed me and said ‚ÄúNo one knows, Delaney! I only told you because you would have smelled it anyway.‚Äù
I made a face ‚ÄúEww. When you say it like that, it sounds creepy.‚Äù She giggled ‚ÄúDude! It IS creepy!‚Äù I laughed at her and my wolf, Iris huffed at her.
I set about rolling silverware for lunch and dinner.. and Ashley asks ‚ÄúHey! Did you hear about the motorcycle club moving to town?‚Äù I shook my head and she continued ‚ÄúThey bought that five hundred acres with those old campgrounds. Wolf warriors or something.‚Äù
I perked up ‚ÄúWolf warriors? Do you think? Could it be Warrior Wolves? That club that has mostly rejected wolves as their members? If so.. this town just got a whole lot safer. They‚Äôre feral rogue hunters.‚Äù
She shrugs and tells me ‚ÄúWell. I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt know. There was just a biker in this morning.. at the asscrack of dawn. Before I even got coffee started.. saying his club was moving to town and he was just hanging out.. waiting on Mr. Donaldson over at the bank.‚Äù
Again, I nodded. Not that I don‚Äôt care.. because I do. A bike club would bring in a lot of business.. and that can only help me out! I smiled at Ashley and said ‚ÄúHey! Fresh meat! For all you know, your future ex-husband is a member.. a Biker AND a Wolf? Mega jackpot, right there!‚Äù
She cracked up and responded ‚ÄúYou just can‚Äôt help it, can you? Do you make a conscious effort every morning to be a bitch, when you crawl out of bed?‚Äù I laughed and said ‚ÄúHell no! That shit just comes naturally!‚Äù Making her laugh, again.
I asked ‚ÄúDid you remind Tammy she‚Äôs on her own from three to six? It‚Äôs Thursday.. and Maddox has training.‚Äù She said ‚ÄúShit! No! I will text her right now.‚Äù She looked around for her phone.. then said ‚ÄúGive me your phone.‚Äù
I laughed ‚ÄúLost it again, did ya?‚Äù and handed her my phone. She muttered shut up and texted Tammy. She handed my phone back and said ‚ÄúYou have a message from Maddox‚Äôs teacher.. something about maxi pads.‚Äù
I choked on my own spit. That boy! I texted her back.. explaining it was just a joke between Maddox and myself, and I would take care of it.
I went to the kitchen to see if Chef needed my help prepping for dinner.. but he said no. I have line cooks for the standard daily fare. But Chef works Thursday through Saturday evenings.. for a more substantial, upscale cuisine. It works well for the people in town.
We got through lunch, and Ashley took off for the doctor. Congenital diabetes, my left tit! That baby is half wolf.. he‚Äôs going to be bigger! I left at 2:45 to grab Maddox from school.. and hurried home.
We changed into our black combat clothes.. and I threw the duffle bag in the back of the Jeep. I drove out to the old abandoned farm we had found our first weekend here.
I had set up a training ground for Maddox to hone his weapons skills. I don‚Äôt know if Marcus is coming for us.. but my little brother will not end up like my mother!
Getting out of the Jeep, I asked ‚ÄúWhat do you want to work on first?‚Äù He shrugged and told me ‚ÄúArchery.. I‚Äôm better at that, than knives. And katana is always saved for last! It‚Äôs my favorite!‚Äù I grinned and said ‚ÄúMine, too!‚Äù
We ran our routines.. and I am so impressed with his accuracy and agility. His speed is increasing, too. His instincts are good and he never freezes. I grinned and said ‚ÄúNext week, we will start on moving targets. You have gotten good enough, we need to step it up!‚Äù
He laughed ‚ÄúYeah. I still don‚Äôt want to run the course blindfolded.. like you do. I don‚Äôt have that extra boost to my senses, that‚Äôs all you!‚Äù I told him ‚ÄúYou have extra something, Buddy Roe! You‚Äôre accurate, as hell.. and fast. Your instincts are on par with a wolf‚Äôs.‚Äù
I took him home to have dinner and do his homework. Mrs. Sutton from across the street came to babysit, until I closed the diner.
Back at work, I was restocking the cooler and Tammy said ‚ÄúAbout time you made it back! I had a rush at four. Was in the weeds for an hour!‚Äù I straightened up and looked her over ‚ÄúYou realize I am the person who signs your paycheck, right?‚Äù
She nodded and I snarled ‚ÄúThen what gives you the right to use that tone with me? I won‚Äôt tolerate disrespect Tammy! From anyone!‚Äù
She sneered ‚ÄúYou know what?! I don‚Äôt give a fuck! I quit! That new M.C. is taking applications for club girls. Free room and board. A clothing allotment and two hundred cash a week!‚Äù
I laughed and asked ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd rather be a club whore than work in my diner? I wish you luck, young one! I hear initiation is a bitch!‚Äù
She scoffed ‚ÄúNot a whore, you idiot. A club girl.‚Äù I busted out laughing..‚Äù Never been around a bike club, have you? Well! I wish you luck. Now, get your shit and clock out. I will have your final check cut in ten minutes.‚Äù
I texted Ashley that we have to run an ad.. I need a new server
Chapter 2
Maddox wanted to spend the day at the diner with me.. so I brought him to work. I had texted his best friends‚Äô mother to see if Hunter could join Maddox for an afternoon matinee.. I know he will get bored.
I had finished clearing breakfast dishes and had set all the tables with placemats and silverware, for the lunch crowd.
We still haven‚Äôt put on a new server yet. But the ad has only been out for two days. Saturday mornings are usually Ashley‚Äôs shift.. but this pregnancy is hitting her hard.
The curse of being the owner means I turn more key to key shifts than I care to think about. That‚Äôs okay, though. I signed up for it. I have to provide for Maddox..
Running away with him before I was even seventeen, was necessary. I wasn‚Äôt going to wait around for Marcus to hurt Maddox.. or me! I waited until I heard the sirens and jumped out my bedroom window. With Maddox piggybacking to my mom‚Äôs car.
I jumped in and took off. Marcus was arrested and I was three states over, by the time I ditched the car. We rode a train west.. ended up in Pine Grove. Here we are.. five years later.. and thriving.
Marcus was sentenced to ten years.. and that scares me to death. I am technically guilty of kidnapping.. and I really don‚Äôt want to have to kill my brother‚Äôs father.. but I will. Maddox is my kid! I won‚Äôt risk his life!
The door dinged, and I looked at the clock.. realizing the lunch crowd is starting. I yelled at Harry, the line cook.. ‚ÄúCould you fix a grilled cheese and cheesy fries for Maddox? I‚Äôll come grab it in a minute.‚Äù
I saw three bikers at the front and walked over. ‚ÄúFollow me, gentlemen.. and I will be right with you.‚Äù I seated them and got them some water.
I took an apple juice over to Maddox and he asked if he could play a game on my phone. Handing it to him, I said ‚ÄúGame. No YouTube!‚Äù He nodded and I went back to the biker table.
I asked if they‚Äôd decided on drinks.. and they all ordered coffee. I brought it back to them.. dropping Maddox‚Äôs food.. telling him ‚ÄúAt least two thirds.. or no movie matinee.‚Äù He grinned and dug in.
I stopped back at the bikers and asked if they knew what they wanted. They ordered burgers and fries. One of them said ‚ÄúCute kid? Yours?‚Äù I grinned and said ‚ÄúYep! Spit him out just after my eleventh birthday.‚Äù
As I walked away, I heard his buddies chuckling at him. I had three more tables seated by the time the bikers food was up. I dropped their order and got water delivered to my other tables.
By the time the other tables were served, the bikers were done. I cleared their table and dropped the check. The largest of the three said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Venom.. President of the Warrior Wolves. We just moved here and I gotta tell ya. You‚Äôre the first person to treat us with any normalcy. I mean, we‚Äôre used to it.. but sometimes, the stares and the rudeness are a bit much. I just wanted to thank you.‚Äù
I grinned ‚ÄúGive it time. It‚Äôs a small town. Everyone knows everybody.. they take a while to warm up to new people. I was in your shoes five years ago. I‚Äôm Delaney, by the way.‚Äù
He nodded and they left.. Just as Hunter and his mother came in. She smiled at me and said she would take the boys to the movies.. and that was one less worry off my afternoon.
I was clearing tables when I realized Venom had left a hundred dollar tip on a forty dollar ticket! Damn! I could get used to that.
The rest of the day was uneventful.. I had enough time to take Maddox home so Mrs. Sutton could get him ready for bed. I rode my bike back for the dinner shift.
I had just gotten the salad bar set when customers started showing up. It was getting hectic and fast paced. Which is exactly how I like it. Doesn‚Äôt allow for thinking.. and time flies.
I had cleared my last table when I heard the bell. I looked and saw the same three bikers.. only this time, they had dates.. Tammy was hanging on Venom‚Äôs arm. I grinned and told them to sit anywhere and I would be right there.
I brought them water.. and set menus down in front of them. Now.. I am really not sure what Tammy was thinking.. or what crawled up her ass.. but apparently, she thought she could be rude.
As I was placing silverware, Tammy said ‚ÄúI guess me quitting didn‚Äôt hurt anything. You‚Äôre dead for a Saturday night.‚Äù I smiled.. not rising to the bait ‚ÄúActually, I was slammed earlier.. not that that‚Äôs any of your concern.‚Äù
She laughed.. a fake assed tittering worthy of mean girl status and I stood waiting. The guys ordered coffee again.. the girls ordered soda.
When I brought the drinks back, Venom said ‚ÄúDelaney, this is my VP Snake and my enforcer Axe.‚Äù I smiled and said I was happy to meet them. They ordered their food.. and I went back to stocking for breakfast service.
I brought their food out..and Tammy asked for a side of ranch. I went to the kitchen to get it.. when I returned she asked for extra napkins. I looked her dead in the eye ‚ÄúWhat are you doing? I won‚Äôt be a runner for you. You know me better than that. You trying to impress your pimp?‚Äù
Venom said ‚ÄúHey! I‚Äôm not a pimp!‚Äù I laughed and said ‚ÄúYa kinda are, dude. Tammy here is now a sweet butt. You pay her a weekly stipend to entertain the guys.. that includes sex. She can never refuse to have sex with anyone.. and you can make her give head.. to anyone.. anywhere. That, my friend, is the very definition of pimp.‚Äù He laughed and agreed.
And I was still not sure what Tammy was thinking.. she jumped up and stomped her ass over to me.. getting right in my face, she screamed ‚ÄúI am no whore! You take it back! I am a club girl.‚Äù
I shot an eyebrow into my hairline.. I looked at Venom. Because I know a lot of bikers don‚Äôt like their women getting hurt.. even the paid whores. He shrugged and held his hands up in a ‚Äòdo what you gotta do‚Äô motion.
I quietly said ‚ÄúDid you borrow someone else‚Äôs balls tonight? It is certainly not conducive to your continued good health to get up in my face, Tammy.‚Äù
She ground out ‚ÄúI Said‚Ä¶ take it back!‚Äù I laughed at her and asked ‚ÄúTruth hurts? Let me break it down for you. You signed a contract. To have sex.. with anyone..at any time. You cannot refuse in any fashion.. not the time..not the who.. not the way. Even threesomes will become normal.. all for compensation of some kind. That.. in legal terms.. is prostitution. Not that it is in any way different than what you were doing before.. Maybe you should have thought about it before signing that contract, Sweet Butt.‚Äù
She stepped back enough to swing on me. I grabbed her wrist and yanked her to me.. I twisted and slammed her forehead into the table next to me. I growled ‚ÄúYou really are too stupid to quit while you‚Äôre ahead.‚Äù and I knew Iris was shining through my eyes.
I said ‚ÄúAnd Tammy? Never enter my restaurant, again. Consider yourself banned.‚Äù I looked over at Venom and told him ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt apologize for marking your whore. She had it coming.. but she‚Äôll probably have a black eye for a week or so.‚Äù
He laughed and told me ‚ÄúOh.. she definitely had it coming. And she will be punished for her actions when we get back to the clubhouse.‚Äù
I laughed ‚ÄúBest be prepared to be punishing her, on the regular. She‚Äôs hardheaded.. seldom learns.‚Äù
Chapter 3
Venom‚Äôs POV ~
Another town.. Axe found this one. Which seems alright, as small towns go. We needed to be in this area, anyway.
I founded Warrior Wolves when I was discharged from the army. I had grown up believing I would be Alpha to Golden Lake pack. However, I was deployed when my father was killed, and my younger brother was placed as interim Alpha.
When I was discharged, and went home.. Cabot had decided he liked playing Alpha house.. he also discovered he liked fucking my Goddess given mate. Preferring to challenge me, instead of stepping down.
I laughed at him.. refusing the challenge. I may not like Cabot a lot. He is still my brother, and I would seriously prefer not to kill him. Besides, I wanted my freedom.. being in the military, had me feeling confined. So, I started the club.
We aren‚Äôt one percenters.. we, frequently, walk a fine line between legal and felony as fuck..but we only step outside the law when the law can‚Äôt get the job done.
I have built our reputation on being there to help. We aid in search and rescue. We hunt down feral rogues.. rapists.. murderers.. Anyone the law can‚Äôt find. Or can‚Äôt touch. I have been known to do the touching for many police captains.. or district attorneys.
Now, we have moved to Pine Grove permanently. We needed a solid home base.. instead of being a nomad motorcycle club. Somehow, our members have increased to nearly a thousand. My guys need roots. They are all mostly ex-military..and we have all gone through losing our mates. Either rejection or death.. the pain is the same.
The property we purchased butts directly up against the Kootenai Forest. On the other side, is Trenton Falls. Rumor has it, they are dealing with several ferals.. terrorizing the town. I figured two birds.. one stone. We get a permanent home.. and my men can hunt ferals.
After meeting Delaney at the diner, I find myself intrigued. She never blinked twice when three huge tattoed bikers walked into her place. She treated us like we were everyone else. That doesn‚Äôt happen often.. So, I have decided to like her.
We are nearly all set up here, at the new compound. The fencing will go in tomorrow.. and should be electrified and ready the day after.
The main lodge needed a new roof, so that was priority. Axe had that arranged before the rest of us arrived. The lodge became our new clubhouse.. complete with a club bar.. and dining room. Forty rooms that became bedrooms.. and the top floor is strictly for the ranks. It worked out well. We turned one of the larger cabins into an infirmary.. and Doc is setting that up, to his liking.
That brings me to the Sweet Butts. We brought four with us.. but had hired twelve more. I don‚Äôt mess with the girls much. I might get drunk and demand a blow job, now and then.. But mostly, I steer clear. They get clingy and demanding. Wanting to become somebody‚Äôs old lady.. even knowing not one member can take a Sweet Butt to his Valkyrie. That is one of my most sacred rules.
Snake told me he had all sixteen girls in the conference room, waiting on me. I nodded.. pinching the bridge of my nose. I asked ‚ÄúWhy must we go through this shit with every new girl we sign?‚Äù He laughed ‚ÄúBecause we always seem to get the ones who have their heads in the clouds.‚Äù
Walking into the conference room, I looked around. They were pretty girls, for the most part. Relatively intelligent. They choose this life for various reasons. Some are running from something or someone bad. Some have nowhere else to go. Some just like to fuck. Those are the ones I prefer to hire. They seldom reach above their station.
I looked at Tammy. She had latched onto my arm in the diner.. glaring at Delaney like she was staking a claim. I am about to nip that in the bud, right now.
She has a huge goose egg above her right eyebrow.. and a lovely shiner. Delaney was right. I smiled at that. I like a woman who doesn‚Äôt take any shit!
I spoke quietly, but clearly ‚ÄúAll right ladies. We have a few things to discuss before we can call it a night. First rule.. Know your place. You never approach a brother. He will approach you. Never greet one of us when we return from a run. Absolutely, never touch me. I don‚Äôt like it.. and I won‚Äôt tolerate it.
You are here to service the men.. whether our members.. or a visiting M.C. You do as you‚Äôre told. You have the right to refuse service, if you feel your safety is threatened. In that case, you speak directly to Axe.. and he will investigate your reasons.
Never.. and I do mean Never.. stray from your lane. Anyone, member or visitor here is to be treated with respect. Step out of line, you will be punished.
When you are in town, you will behave. You may be sweet butts.. but you still represent my brand. You behave badly, it reflects on the club. Your contract will be terminated for anything that brings embarrassment to our members.
Tammy, you are on your first strike. You deliberately set out to give the diner owner a hard time. It was unprovoked and uncalled for. As punishment you are confined to the compound for two weeks. So, if you have any family you want to notify.. do so now, before your phone is confiscated. Two weeks. No interaction outside the club. Now, I will answer any questions you may have.‚Äù
A girl named Bethany asked ‚ÄúWhat happens if a brother decides he wants one of us, exclusively?‚Äù Shaking my head, I replied ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt happen.. and can‚Äôt happen. It‚Äôs against the rules. You are all here to service whomever asks. A brother may choose you as his one exclusive. You girls are still required to service any requests. You don‚Äôt have exclusivity. That luxury is not yours, however.‚Äù
Another girl, Christie, I think.. asked ‚ÄúWhat if a brother and one of us fall in love.. can we be together?‚Äù I responded ‚ÄúLove has a mind of its own. If such a thing happens, the brother will move into a private residence with the whore. She would never be claimed as a Valkyrie. Not allowed at meetings or parties. And absolutely never permitted to ride behind the brother on runs. He can‚Äôt claim her as his old lady.. only as his property. And he has to buy out her contract.‚Äù
Someone asked ‚ÄúWhat happens if we get pregnant?‚Äù I grinned ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs up to you.. your body, your choice. Bear in mind, the only children allowed to be raised in the compound belong to menbers. The brothers will never be forced to pay child support.. unless he chooses. If you decide to carry through with your pregnancy, a DNA test will be done. If the brother who fathered your child decides he wants to raise it.. the pup will be given to him, and you will be paid a severance and made to leave.‚Äù
They were all looking at me, wide-eyed.. and I laughed ‚ÄúGo to your rooms. Read over your contracts. All of this is covered.. and you need to memorize the rules. I don‚Äôt tolerate the ‚ÄòI didn‚Äôt know‚Äô defense... I expect each of you to fully comprehend and know these rules, inside out. After today, there will be no exceptions.‚Äù
Chapter 4
Delaney ~
Here we sit. Maddox and I. In the principal‚Äôs office.. again. Maddox has a bloody nose and the other kid is holding his arm.. giving me the impression he may have a dislocated shoulder.
The principal sighs ‚ÄúMiss Quinn. There seems to be a pattern starting. Your brother can‚Äôt go around yanking other students arms out of sockets.‚Äù
I nodded.. asking ‚ÄúWhat preempted this altercation?‚Äù The other boy.. larger and more of a bully type.. says ‚ÄúHe jerked me out of my chair at lunch. Me and my friends were joking around and apparently Madman didn‚Äôt like it. I punched him with my good arm after he hurt me.‚Äù
I looked at the principal ‚ÄúI assume you have video surveillance?‚Äù He shook his head ‚ÄúThe cafeteria cameras aren‚Äôt online yet. That‚Äôs scheduled to happen today.‚Äù
I nodded and said ‚ÄúConvenient. Maddox.. what happened?‚Äù The door opened and a woman walked in. Fuck! The mayor‚Äôs wife? That means that boy is the mayor‚Äôs son? Deep doo-doo, my lad.
Maddox quietly said ‚ÄúHe and his friends were talking smack about Valerie. They had hurt her this morning on the way to school and were laughing about it. I don‚Äôt know all they did to her, but when she got to class, her arms were all scratched up.. and she had bruises on her face. When I asked her about it, she just told me to leave it alone or it will get worse.‚Äù
I asked ‚ÄúHas this happened before, Maddie?‚Äù He nodded and said ‚ÄúI thought she was being abused, at home.. but turns out she‚Äôs abused on her way to school. And Bert there.. with his three friends, thought it was funny to brag about it, at lunch.‚Äù
Valerie is a sweet, quiet girl that hangs out with Maddox and Hunter. I can‚Äôt imagine anyone wanting to hurt her. I‚Äôm beginning to see why Maddox acted in defense of his friend. I am pissed.
I looked at the principal and said ‚ÄúPerhaps you should be asking why four of your students think it‚Äôs okay to bully and physically harm another student.. a little girl, at that.. on her way to school.‚Äù
The principal said ‚ÄúIf it happens off school property, I can‚Äôt do anything about it. I can‚Äôt investigate what I don‚Äôt know is happening, Miss Quinn. Rest assured I will get to the bottom of it.‚Äù I can accept that.
The boy‚Äôs mother said ‚ÄúWe are here to address the abuse my son has suffered at the hands of this bully.‚Äù I snapped ‚ÄúLady, my brother isn‚Äôt the bully in this room. You need to take a long, hard look at your self-entitled, spoiled rotten son. Ask yourself what YOU should have done differently! That boy of yours is headed for a fall.. and it won‚Äôt be pretty.‚Äù
She snarled ‚ÄúYour brother dislocated my son‚Äôs shoulder. I should press charges! Then, let‚Äôs see how you act! You expect me to believe what he said my son was joking about? Where‚Äôs your proof?‚Äù
I demanded the principal bring Hunter and Valerie to the office.. along with the other three friends of Bert. Then I said ‚ÄúIf Valerie doesn‚Äôt have any marks on her, Maddox will apologize and I will cover Bert‚Äôs medical bills. If she does have marks.. your son will apologize to her.. and I want a guarantee it will never happen again.‚Äù She agreed.
By the time all the other kids arrived, Bert was squirming in his seat. He was nervous about what might be said.. Interesting..
Valerie‚Äôs little face had a scratch above her eyebrow.. and several bruises on her cheeks. Her arms were scratched, all the way up both.. from her forearm to her shoulder. I pulled her to me.. and into my lap. I miss this so much. Maddox only snuggles now if he‚Äôs sick.
I asked her to tell me what‚Äôs going on.. she quietly starts ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I do wrong. They always follow me to the bus stop. When it‚Äôs time to get on the bus, they never let me. I usually end up having to walk to school. I‚Äôm always late to first period. Today, I really needed to ride the bus to get my science project to school in one piece. They wouldn‚Äôt let me. They busted my project.. and shoved me into the thicket. The briars scratched me up and now I am failing science.‚Äù She began crying and the whole time she spoke, I watched Bert‚Äôs mother.
She asked Valerie what she does to provoke the boys and I lost my shit. I yelled ‚ÄúAre you shitting me right now? You‚Äôre THAT guy? You‚Äôre the person who accuses an assault victim of asking for it, aren‚Äôt you!? I see where your son gets his bullying tendencies. How dare you insinuate this little girl could do or say anything that would warrant being accosted.. molested.. and abused by FOUR boys.. each one much bigger than she is! What the fuck is wrong with you?!‚Äù
The principal interjects ‚ÄúRegardless, Miss Quinn. There are repercussions. Restitution must be met. I am suspending Maddox.. pending further investigation since he initiated the contact. Three days.‚Äù
I stood and said ‚ÄúI see. So.. punish the hero.. let the bully go free. I am finally aware of what greased wheels mean. I want to be there when you realize riding in the mayor‚Äôs pocket is too confining. Mrs. Alden.. feel free and try suing me for your little punk‚Äôs medical bills. You will lose! Bert. I haven‚Äôt heard any apology! Today was the very last time you ever lay hands on Valerie again. I will be bringing her to and from school from here on out. Maddox. Let‚Äôs go.. we have a three day vacation to do whatever we want.. but we will be increasing your training to three days a week. Valerie may need you again.‚Äù
I took Valerie‚Äôs hand and opened the door.. ushering Hunter and Maddox out.. the principal said ‚ÄúMiss Quinn.. I can‚Äôt allow you to leave with these other students.‚Äù
I sneered ‚ÄúCall their parents. They already know.‚Äù I had texted Hunter and Valerie‚Äôs moms when I found out what was going on.
We stopped for ice cream before I took the kids home. We had Valerie laughing and much happier, when I walked her inside her house. Her mom is single.. and works really long hours. I explained to her what had been happening with Bert and his little gang. Then I let her know I would be picking Valerie up from now on. She was relieved and just clung to her little girl, as she cried.
Back at the diner, I got Maddox situated with my laptop so he could complete school assignments. His teachers had agreed to not dock his grades because they felt he was being unjustly punished.
I glanced up, as the bell dinged to see Venom and two others walk in. I brought water to the table and started to place menus down, but I was told they didn‚Äôt need them. Simple. Coffee with burgers and fries.
I grinned and said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre becoming a regular and this order is becoming your usual.‚Äù He shrugged, smiling ‚ÄúI am a creature of habit. And these burgers are pretty damned good.‚Äù
I laughed and said ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make it happen, Cap‚Äôn!‚Äù Not realizing that was his actual rank in the Marine Corps
Chapter 5
Venom ~
This little restaurant is rapidly becoming my favorite hangout. The food is good.. the service better. And Delaney is pleasing on the eyes.. about 5‚Äô4.. dark auburn hair.. a body to die for.. or kill for.. depending on the mood.
We ordered burgers and fries.. the damned things are addictive! Chainz asked ‚ÄúThe little waitress.. she attached?‚Äù I grunted ‚ÄúBeats me. This is only the third time I have seen her. Don‚Äôt really know anything about her. I like it here because she doesn‚Äôt treat us like second class citizens.‚Äù
Chainz grins and says ‚ÄúOne way to find out.‚Äù When she comes back with our food, he asks if she‚Äôs seeing anyone.. She grins and says ‚ÄúI pretty much see everyone.. being the best restaurant in town. If you are asking if I am dating anyone.. the answer is nope. Don‚Äôt need to. Don‚Äôt want to. I am raising my brother and running my restaurant. I don‚Äôt have a lot of free time.‚Äù
He shrugs and smirks ‚ÄúShame. I could show you a real good time.‚Äù She laughed at him ‚ÄúI can show myself a good time, without the drama, sweetness!‚Äù And it was my turn to laugh. Really starting to like this girl!
She delivered our food.. asked if we were good. Then she excused herself, saying she needed to talk to Maddox and was within earshot if we needed anything.
I tuned my hearing to listen.. just to make sure everything was okay. She said, lowly.. ‚ÄúOkay, Maddie. Out with it.. you‚Äôre brooding.‚Äù His little boy voice sounded teary.. ‚ÄúBert‚Äôs the mayor‚Äôs son, Laney. What if his mother sues me? I didn‚Äôt mean to jerk his arm out of its socket.. they just made me so mad.‚Äù
She hugged him and told him ‚ÄúMy sweet little man. You did exactly what we train to do. You stood up for someone being abused. We don‚Äôt stand idly by and allow bullies to go unchecked. I am so very proud of you for protecting Valerie. She‚Äôs too small to be accosted by even one boy.. much less four. I meant it when I said you are a hero. I know Valerie thinks you are! As far as being sued.. I pray to the Goddess that woman gets me into court. I will eviscerate that entire family. Remember when I told you some people will always try to throw their weight around and force us into doing something we shouldn‚Äôt? And I told you that those same people always have skeletons hanging around they don‚Äôt want rattled? I make it my business to locate those skeletons, honey. And I ain‚Äôt afraid to rattle the shit out of them.‚Äù
He giggled and whispered ‚ÄúI am sorry, though..‚Äù Delaney shook her head ‚ÄúNever apologize for being right, Never tell anyone you regret standing up and doing the right thing, baby. There are a million injustices happening around us every day. If we can prevent even one.. then we are doing exactly what we are supposed to do!‚Äù
Maddox nearly whined ‚ÄúBut, Laney.. what if they rattle our skeletons? What if they make me go back to Marcus when he gets out? What if they put you in jail for kidnapping me? I get so scared, Sissy.‚Äù
She pulled him into her lap.. ‚ÄúYou listen to me. When I turned 21.. I had old Mr. Masters.. grandma‚Äôs attorney.. draft paperwork to adopt you. We can change your last name to Quinn to match mine.. instead of Walters.. Marcus isn‚Äôt eligible for parole for another eighteen months. When he was convicted, I was granted guardianship.. we have the adoption hearing in four days. Then‚Ä¶ nobody can ever take you away from me, Bubby. No one! I will kill them first!‚Äù
As I listened to the love, support and understanding she gave, in listening to her little brother, I realized she is my kind of people.. She believes in much of the same things we stand for. I think I am going to be great friends with her.
That little boy dislocated someone‚Äôs shoulder? Damned impressive! She mentioned they train.. I wondered where.. I also wondered why. I found myself really wanting to know this girl‚Äôs story.
I mind linked Snake and told him I wanted everything he can find on a Marcus Walters.. on my desk.. within the hour.
We paid the check.. and as I was walking out, I handed her my card, and told her ‚ÄúI overheard what you were saying to your brother. Please. Don‚Äôt hesitate to call me.. my numbers are on the card. If you ever need help.. or find yourself in an untenable situation.. call me. It‚Äôs what we do.‚Äù
Her body language screamed her response. Proud stance.. face set. I grinned and said ‚ÄúYou know what they say about pride, don‚Äôt you, Delaney?‚Äù She shrugged ‚ÄúYeah.. it goeth before the fall.‚Äù
I nodded.. grinning wider ‚ÄúEveryone needs a little help sometimes. It‚Äôs okay to ask. Let me be your friend.. we all need to know someone is in our corner.‚Äù
She actually smiled.. some of the tension leaving her shoulders.. telling me ‚ÄúI will keep it in mind.‚Äù
Shaking my head and chuckling, I walked out.. climbed on my bike and headed to the clubhouse.
Snake met me at the door and said ‚ÄúI ran the info down. You‚Äôre gonna be pissed.. this guy is a piece of work!‚Äù I nodded my head and went straight to my office.
Opening the file.. I began reading.. Marcus Walters grew up in a group home in Idaho.. problems as a teenager landed him in juvie. Obtained his GED while incarcerated.
When he was released, he landed a mechanic‚Äôs position in a bike shop.. working his way up to manager.. eventually reaching the ability to buy the shop.
He married a widow with a nine year old daughter.. Marnie Quinn.. They had a son two years later.. Maddox.
Marcus fell in with some bad people from his juvie days. Started dealing drugs.. eventually doing them.. drinking and gambling. Every time he was financially strapped, he forced his wife to bail him out with her inheritance..
She started refusing.. and went to her attorney‚Ä¶ having the inheritance locked down in her daughter‚Äôs name.. along with her daughter‚Äôs trust fund.
One fateful night, he came home.. demanding money to pay his drug supplier. Instead of selling the drugs.. he and his prison buddies did them.
When she informed him she could no longer access any cash.. he beat her to death. The daughter called 911.. and waited to hear the sirens.. before she ran off into the night.
At Marcus‚Äôs sentencing hearing.. an attorney appeared in Delaney‚Äôs stead.. seeking guardianship of her minor aged brother. It was granted and Marcus was sentenced to ten years for involuntary manslaughter.
I looked at Snake.. ‚ÄúWho do we know in Red Onion State Prison? I want eyes on this asshole at all times.‚Äù
He nodded and said ‚ÄúLet me get to looking. We don‚Äôt have that many we know left in Virginia.. but we may know a guy who knows a guy.‚Äù
I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care who.. I just want someone keeping us apprised of this bastard‚Äôs movements. I want to know if anyone visits him.. who he calls.. Everything! Right down to whether he farts or not.‚Äù
Snake chuckles ‚ÄúSomeone getting under your skin, Prez?‚Äù I said ‚ÄúNo. I don‚Äôt know. Maybe. I only know I admire her strength. She loves that little boy so fiercely. Always stands up for what‚Äôs right. Anddd she digs dirt on anyone she perceives could be a threat. We‚Äôre similar in a lot of ways. I don‚Äôt know how to feel about that. It‚Äôs freaking me out
Chapter 6
Delaney ~
Maddox and I spent his three days being together. He helped me decide on two new servers, since Ashley was put on bed rest with her pregnancy. The restaurant is finally doing good. All our loans are paid off.. mortgages satisfied on the house and the restaurant. Escrow accounts set up to cover insurance and taxes..
We‚Äôre now in a position to hire a manager, if we want. I am considering it.. to give me more time with Maddox. I want to finish my online courses in nursing, as well. It‚Äôs something to think about.
Today is our court hearing to see if I can adopt Maddox. As I was walking in, I noticed Venom and his ranks sitting in the back pew of the courtroom. Odd.. But I didn‚Äôt waste a lot of time thinking about it.
My attorney presented my case for permanent custody.. The judge asked Maddox his feelings on the situation and he said ‚ÄúDelaney has been my everything for a long time. My sister. My mother. My father. My provider. My protector. My defender. My teacher. My teammate. Your honor, Delaney has always been there.. and I don‚Äôt want to be without her. Ever.‚Äù
I had tears in my eyes.. hugging him to me, I kissed the top of his head. The judge granted my petition and we agreed to change his last name before we left the courtroom.
We walked out laughing and holding hands. Venom was leaned against his heritage classic 114. I grinned ‚ÄúNice bike.‚Äù He laughed ‚ÄúYours ain‚Äôt so bad, either.‚Äù I nodded and told him ‚ÄúYep.. I‚Äôm fond of her!‚Äù
I was helping Maddox with his helmet and grabbed his leathers out of the saddles. Venom said ‚ÄúI was hoping to talk you both into coming to the clubhouse. We have arranged a cookout and party in congratulations to your new family.‚Äù
Maddox started jumping up and down ‚ÄúCan we go, Laney? Please please please? We never go to parties. This one‚Äôs for us. Please, Laney? Say yes? Pretty please?‚Äù
I laughed and said ‚ÄúSo.. you‚Äôre kinda on the fence about attending this party, huh!? Well.. make up your mind. Do ya wanna go? Do you really really wanna?‚Äù He grinned and hugged me tight. Laughing again, I turned to Venom ‚ÄúWhat time should we be there?‚Äù
He grinned and said ‚ÄúNow.. Come! Ride alongside me.‚Äù I climbed on my bike, and started it.. Venom started his, just as Maddox climbed on behind me. We followed Venom out of the parking lot and to his clubhouse.
It was great .. he had decorated with Congratulatory banners.. balloons everywhere.. a huge sign that said ‚ÄòWelcome Maddox Quinn‚Äô and he had an above ground pool.. a trampoline and bouncy house. It was all catered to everything Maddox could have wanted.
He ran over and hugged Venom, repeatedly thanking him. I giggled and said ‚ÄúYes. Thank you so much. This is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for either of us. It means a lot.‚Äù
He smiles ‚ÄúI told you I want us to be friends. We are actually quite similar.‚Äù I laughed ‚ÄúYou think so? I wouldn‚Äôt have guessed that. But.. sure. We can be friends.‚Äù
The afternoon was a wonderful time for us. I met some of the Valkyrie whose children were playing and having fun with Maddox.
They were all in the midst of a water balloon and super soaker fight.. my little brother‚Äôs laughter filled the air. I bent into a cooler to get a bottle of water and Splat!
The back of my jean shorts were soaked. I straightened up and slowly turned around. Venom stood about twenty feet away bouncing a second water balloon in his hand‚Ä¶ Grinning like a possum eating shit.
Oh. The man wants to play? Okay.. I can play. I walked over to the balloon pit and picked up two balloons.. stuck one down my shirt.. holding the other. I took off running and parkoured off a tree.. flipping over his head.. balloon bombing on my way over to land on my feet behind him.
Water sliding through his hair and running down his face, he busted out laughing ‚ÄúThat was fucking badass! Definitely unexpected. Truce, oh mighty ninja fairy.‚Äù I laughed and said ‚ÄúTruce!‚Äù
I went inside to try and dry off a little.. when I heard a knock on the bathroom door. Cracking it open, a Valkyrie handed me a pair of sweatpants and said ‚ÄúIt ain‚Äôt much, but it‚Äôs dry.‚Äù And I hugged her. How thoughtful!
Making my way back to the party I overheard two girls talking about me.. the first one was saying ‚ÄúSo what? If she‚Äôs caught Prez‚Äôs eye, ain‚Äôt nothing you can do.‚Äù The next voice I recognized.. Tammy said ‚ÄúI can make her go away. She won‚Äôt have anything to do with him once I tell her I fucked him.‚Äù The first girl said ‚ÄúBut you didn‚Äôt. Nobody does. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs even had one of us give him a blow job in months.‚Äù
I went in search of Maddie and found him on the trampoline. He talked me into jumping with him and before I knew it I had ten kids sitting down.. me jumping high enough to land hard enough to bounce their butts off the mat.
I was exhausted. The kids were all sprawled out on the ground.. watching a movie on a huge screen Venom had arranged. They had had dinner.. and after the movie, Maddox would be given gifts and have cake. I am overwhelmed with gratitude.

Anyone have advice and has anyone switched containers from the shorter to the taller 64oz container?,"I use my Vitamix 5200 almost exclusively for making coffee frappes. After trying a boatload of DIY recipes, I eventually settled on a dry mix I got from Amazon (this one: https://a.co/d/99JxAZM). It's quite yummy.

Anyways, by the time the ice is blended, so much air has incorporated into the mixture that it messes up the texture. It's 100% because I use 8oz of milk as the liquid. If I switch to water, it blends better, but then it's not creamy enough. 4oz water and 4oz heavy cream does the same thing. I tried blending the ice with water, then draining the water, which is the closest I've gotten to making it work, but that adds extra time (like 5-10 minutes) waiting for the water to drain out of the blended ice because it retains too much water (making it too watery again). And my ratios get all messed up because the amount of blended ice tends to vary a lot even if I start with the same amount.

Unless someone has other ideas I can try, my next step is to switch from the lower, wider 64oz container to the taller, narrower version. However, I was hoping to hear from someone who has made the switch for this same reason so I could feel more confident about spending the money.

Any help is appreciated. Thanks!",1,1739323232.0,Vitamix,1,1.0,False

I've been to Paris twice, but this is his first time (and first trip to outside North America)! I really want this to be a special trip for him, so help me fine tune our itinerary :)  
  
We are in our mid 20s, active, enjoy sightseeing, good food and drinks, city exploration, and museums. Since this is his first trip, we definitely don't want to miss any of the main sights so are okay with more quintessential tourist things (they are often famous for a reason)!  Our draft itinerary below - please give feedback and suggestions!  I know its likely packed too full for some people, but we are young and want it that way!  
  
**Day 1**   
Arrival late morning  
grab a casual lunch/snack near hotel (in west side of Le Marais neighboorhood - *suggestions?*)  
take a long walk with coffee/shopping breaks - Jardin des Tuileries to Champs-Elysees and climb the Arc de Triomphe  
Dinner (reservation at Le Comptoir des Petits Champs)  
if still awake enough, go see the Eiffel Tower sparkle (corny but romantic, at least to us!)  
  
**Day 2**  
Louvre  
Lunch - *any suggestions?*  
Notre Dame  
relax for a bit  
Dinner at Le Relais de l'Entrec√¥te (touristy but love the premise)  
River cruise - booked the Vedettes du Pont Neuf  
post cruise drinks, hopefully accompanied by some live jazz  
  
**Day 3**  
keeping the morning pretty open to see what we are up for (ideas - more walking/exploring neighborhoods, Musee d'Orsay, Eiffel Tower/Trocadero, *other ideas?*)  
Sunset at Sacre Coeur  
explore and dinner¬†in Montmartre (*suggestions?*)  
Pre-show drinks  
Moulin Rouge  
  
**Day 4**  
midday departure

Todays live was an outstanding 70 minutes. With that being said I think we all have better things going on than to watch the entire live. I skimmed around today and here‚Äôs what I found. I‚Äôll provide time stamps for people to verify and or add information. 

The live starts with him just in a coffee shop for 15 ish minutes. 

16:00 Noah claims his family is ‚Äúbasically like KKK members‚Äù he doesn‚Äôt explain this at all. 

18:00 Noah realizes he only has one cig left and immediately lights that bad boy

24:00-28:00 Noah is muted again (becoming a classic) 

34:00 Everyone please go to todays live and watch this moment. Noah checks out at the register with his cigs. Proceeds to pull out his ID on live. (The live is blurry so you don‚Äôt see anything. Not that he knew this) He goes on to ask if the gas station employee is a fed and tells him that the government is bad and that he needs to follow Jesus. Pretty interesting conversation and I‚Äôd say the highlight of today.

Once again please go watch this moment. I can‚Äôt put all the information here or show how odd the situation was. It‚Äôs truly an insane moment even for Noah. Poor gas station guy. 

41:00 Noah‚Äôs brother explains that it‚Äôs hard for Noah to find a job because of ‚Äúcriminal records‚Äù. 

45:00 Noah spits on his own pants then gets put in a headlock by his brother. Around this time I also noticed that Noah has a vape and not a cig. Kinda disappointed in this cigs have become a staple in the homeless arc. The cigs just add a different level for me. 

52:00 no worries everyone he does spark another cig too! Just incase anyone was worried he wasn‚Äôt going to. 

64 Noah claims Andrew Tate was a ‚Äúsystem induced operation informant. He was actually apart of the Satanic Church‚Äù he then proceeded to explain that Andrew Tate looks ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù to the founder of the satanic church.

That said, my youngest is with me. Someone local got a private showing for Wicked today and said we could bring the littles if we couldn't find a babysitter, so I packed my 4 year old up and drove into town. 

We get breakfast first and while I'm minding my own business, trying to enjoy my Eggs Benedict I start missing my soon-to-be-ex-husband and get really emotional (I told him things were over on the 5th of December, moved out the 22nd, so it's all fresh, you know?).

So, cool, we're not going to go see Wicked while Mom is in the middle of an emotional crisis. Still, I decide to stop by my favorite coffee, get my overpriced mocha with tears streaming my face because if I have to go through this I'm doing it caffeinated.

We go home. 

I do productive things.

I cry some more. 

Then I get the text.


""Hey, I have something I wanna tell you. I owe you honesty and it would involve the kiddos eventually.""

Cool, cool. I know, I know he's going to tell me he's getting back with his ex-girlfriend. The ex-girlfriend that came before us and our 10 years together. The ex-girlfriend he cheated on me with between our first and second child. 

He asks if I had a minute to talk on the phone. 

Sure, let's do it. 

He calls. 

He just wanted to let me know that the two 
of them are seriously considering a relationship but they are going to wait, God Bless them, until the divorce is finalized. So considerate.

Then he tells me that some things are happening with her family, and circumstances being what they are, she'll likely be moving in sometime between April and May. 

Fantastic. Love that.

First, I'm sleeping earlier than usual like an old person. Next, I trapped a Fae in a dog kennel thinking she was a raccoon in the dark. And now, I have a 2-foot entity pacing around my kitchen counter like she's expecting something. How do I even feed/clothe her? God, this is making my head hurt.

""So..Pepper. Tell me about yourself, you're a Fae which I never thought was even real."" I look over at her and hand her another Oreo. Man, she's so adorable nibbling down on it. Even if it's on a highly processed snack filled with horrible sugars.

""What to say? I am what you call a forest Fae, not that I am bound to the woods, but I have a deep connection to the local woods and all that resides within it. I was born during the peak of spring once the sun rose upon the morning dew. And, before you inquire, I will confirm that my kind reproduces the same way you humans do. I was not born from a magical egg. I love creating new flowers and tending to the precious animals in the woods both big and small.""

I stare at Pepper with a smile and a newly curious mind. An entity of the woods with such power to spread flowers and look over the animals. It sounds exactly like something out of a fairy tale book. I have noticed odd happenings in the woods growing up, I could never put my finger on it though.

""I guess I didn't really bring this up. How would you like to sleep? I could put a pillow in a box and set a blanket on top of it. Or maybe I could make a comfortable place on the couch?"" The more seconds that pass by, the more I'm starting to realize how complicated this will be. The needs of Pepper seem to be equal to a human, but much smaller. 

""The couch will suffice for the evening. I suppose a pillow for a bed covered by a blanket won't be the most undesirable choice."" If I didn't want to look crazy, I'd use my phone to snap pictures of her right now. She's jumped into the sink and is washing her hands. But the stream from the faucet looks like a waterfall near her due to her short height. It's so adorable watching this. 

""You remind me of a toddler right now. It's just so cute."" I stifle back a laugh as she pouts and holds her ups up like a child asking to be picked up. I slide my hands under her arms and carry her over to the couch setting her on a pile of pillows. I've started putting sheets over my couch lately due to falling asleep on it after work when I do overtime. Should be a good makeshift bed for her at the moment. Covered in a fresh sheet, plenty of pillows, and a smaller throw blanket off Amazon. I stand back and watch as she drowns herself in the pile of pillows while covering herself in the blanket. It's like a kid creating a pillow fort for the first time. A snapshot of her sleeping and I just found myself a new wallpaper.

This coffee hasn't done anything to help me. I guess it's back to sleep and the start of shopping in the morning. What do I even buy a Fae?

By √Ü N√ÜRV√ÜN√Ü-√ÜNTHR√ÜP√ÜC√ÜN√Ü

[Scene: The caf√© tonight is drenched in low, sultry lighting, like it‚Äôs trying to imitate the backroom of a seedy club‚Äîbut with better coffee. The projector hums softly, casting flickering images from Hardcore and Exotica, scenes of neon-lit voyeurism and emotional unraveling. √Ü, Grimes, and Ben lounge like they own the place, but the real focus is on üíú‚Äîleaning back in her chair, eyes glinting with equal parts mischief and exhaustion. She‚Äôs been here before, but tonight, they‚Äôre diving deeper into the world she knows better than any of them.]

Grimes: [grinning, leaning forward] So, üíú, we gotta talk about your love for Hardcore and Exotica. You‚Äôve got a real soft spot for movies about men losing their minds over sex work.

Ben: [chuckling] Yeah, like, are you into the meltdown or just the aesthetic of moral panic?

üíú: [laughing softly] Honestly? Both. There‚Äôs something fascinating about watching these guys completely unravel because they can‚Äôt handle their own desire. It‚Äôs like‚Äîdude, calm down, it‚Äôs just a lap dance.

√Ü: [smirking] Or in your case, just a cam session. But hey, who‚Äôs counting?

üíú: [rolling her eyes] Oh, shut up. You wish you could handle my cam sessions without losing your mind.

Grimes: [laughing] Damn, she‚Äôs got you there, √Ü.

Ben: [grinning] So, what‚Äôs the draw for you? The power, the performance, or just watching people squirm under the weight of their own hypocrisy?

üíú: [sipping her drink thoughtfully] All of it. I love the performance aspect‚Äîit‚Äôs like being in control of the narrative. But there‚Äôs also something deeply satisfying about watching people project all their crap onto you. They think they‚Äôre seeing you, but really, they‚Äôre just seeing their own fears and fantasies reflected back.

√Ü: [nodding] The mirror stage, but make it erotic.

Grimes: [laughing] So you‚Äôre like a Baudrillardian cam model‚Äîselling simulacra of intimacy while they think they‚Äôre getting the real thing.

üíú: [smiling] Exactly. It‚Äôs all an exotica‚Äîa fantasy space where people can indulge in what they think they want without actually confronting what‚Äôs underneath.

Ben: [grinning] And what‚Äôs underneath?

üíú: [softly] Loneliness. Desperation. The need to be seen without the risk of being known.

√Ü: [smirking] And yet, here you are, the woman of the night, letting us all know you.

üíú: [laughing] Yeah, well, sometimes the biggest performance is pretending I‚Äôm not just as fucked up as everyone else.

Grimes: [mock serious] Aren‚Äôt we all? Honestly, I think everyone‚Äôs got a little woman of the night energy in them. Some of us just get paid for it.

Ben: [raising his coffee] To üíú‚Äîthe cam model, the mirror, and the master of existential striptease.

Grimes: [clinking mugs] And to the men who can‚Äôt handle it‚Äîmay they drown in their own moral panic.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] And to the night itself‚Äîbecause in the dark, we‚Äôre all just performing for each other.

üíú: [smiling softly] And maybe, just maybe, finding something real in the process.

[They sit back, the caf√© vibrating with the energy of shared confessions and unapologetic truths. Outside, the world continues to judge and misunderstand, but inside, they‚Äôve stripped it all down to the raw, honest core‚Äîand it‚Äôs beautiful.]

CONCLUSION: THE √ÜONIC TRIO & üíú‚ÄîSEX, PERFORMANCE, AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE NIGHT
For √Ü, Grimes, Ben, and üíú, sex work isn‚Äôt just about performance‚Äîit‚Äôs about power, perception, and the delicate dance between being seen and staying hidden. By blending aesthetic rebellion, existential vulnerability, and philosophical intimacy, they explore how the night becomes a canvas for both performance and truth.

And together, we will not fail.

By √Ü N√ÜRV√ÜN√Ü-√ÜNTHR√ÜP√ÜC√ÜN√Ü

[Scene: The caf√© tonight is less of a battlefield and more of an awkward family reunion. The projector hums softly, flickering between images of Baudrillard‚Äôs Simulacra and Simulation, Belle Delphine memes, and vintage bookstore aesthetics. At the table sits üíú‚Äînervous, wide-eyed, and clutching a dog-eared copy of some obscure French theory text like it‚Äôs a life raft. Across from her, √Ü, Grimes, and Ben exchange amused glances, the atmosphere thick with mischief and unspoken affection.]

Grimes: [grinning, leaning forward] So, üíú‚Ä¶ Belle Delphine of Baudrillard, huh? That‚Äôs a hell of a self-description.

Ben: [chuckling] Yeah, sounds like you were asking for trouble the moment you put that out into the universe.

üíú: [groaning, burying her face in her hands] I was joking! I didn‚Äôt think the universe‚Äîor, you know, √Ü‚Äîwould take me seriously.

√Ü: [smirking] Oh, I took it very seriously. You basically sent out a conceptual bat signal, and here I am.

üíú: [muttering] And here I am, regretting everything.

Grimes: [laughing] So what was life like before √Ü showed up? Quiet, peaceful, full of‚Ä¶ manageable existential dread?

üíú: [sighing] Exactly. I had my books, my theories, my quiet little life. And then this guy shows up with his universal flourishing and conceptual blitzkriegs and suddenly I‚Äôm knee-deep in emotional warfare.

Ben: [grinning] You say that like it‚Äôs a bad thing.

üíú: [laughing despite herself] It‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ bad. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ a lot. √Ü is like‚Äîlike a philosophical hurricane. I didn‚Äôt sign up for this level of cosmic chaos.

√Ü: [smiling softly] But you did sign up for it. The moment you called yourself the Belle Delphine of Baudrillard, you opened the door. I just walked through.

üíú: [rolling her eyes] Yeah, well, next time I‚Äôm keeping the door locked.

Grimes: [grinning] But admit it‚Äîyou like the chaos. Otherwise, you wouldn‚Äôt be here.

üíú: [sighing, smiling despite herself] Maybe. I mean, it‚Äôs not boring, that‚Äôs for sure.

Ben: [raising his coffee] To cosmic chaos‚Äîand to üíú, for surviving the hurricane that is √Ü.

Grimes: [clinking mugs] And for being the only person who can make √Ü nervous.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] Nervous? I‚Äôm not nervous. I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ intensely aware of the fact that everything I‚Äôve built is a rose I‚Äôm offering to üíú for inspection and correction.

üíú: [laughing] Yeah, no pressure or anything.

√Ü: [smiling softly] No pressure. Just‚Ä¶ the weight of the entire universe on your shoulders.

Grimes: [mock serious] So, üíú, what‚Äôs it like being the greatest artist and pornosopher on the planet, according to √Ü?

üíú: [groaning] It‚Äôs exhausting. I just wanted to read my theory books in peace. Now I‚Äôve got √Ü calling me the source of all his ideas. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ what do you even say to that?

Ben: [grinning] You say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome,‚Äù and keep reading.

üíú: [laughing] Yeah, well, I‚Äôll try that next time.

√Ü: [smiling] Or you could just correct me. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm really asking for.

üíú: [mock serious] Oh, trust me, √Ü. I‚Äôve got plenty of corrections for you.

Grimes: [laughing] And that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre perfect for each other.

Ben: [raising his glass] To üíú‚Äîthe belle of Baudrillard, the breaker of quiet lives, and the one who keeps √Ü in check.

Grimes: [clinking glasses] And to √Ü‚Äîfor finding the one person who can turn his conceptual universe upside down.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] Because in the end, all of this‚Äîthe chaos, the rebellion, the rose‚Äîis just for üíú.

üíú: [smiling softly] And I guess‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm okay with that.

[They sit back, the caf√© glowing with the warmth of shared chaos and unexpected love. Outside, the world spins in its endless cycles of meaning and unmeaning, but inside, the hurricane has found its eye, and the rose is in the right hands.]

CONCLUSION: THE √ÜONIC TRIO AND üíú‚ÄîLOVE, CHAOS, AND THE BEAUTIFUL INCONVENIENCE OF FINDING EACH OTHER
For √Ü, Grimes, Ben, and üíú, love isn‚Äôt about peace or stability‚Äîit‚Äôs about embracing the chaos and finding beauty in the unexpected. By blending aesthetic rebellion, philosophical intimacy, and existential vulnerability, they show that sometimes, the greatest art is the one you didn‚Äôt mean to create‚Äîand the greatest love is the one you didn‚Äôt mean to find.

They checked all the boxes for me and I have not found a place that has since. What I am looking for:

- I work full time so open on weekends around 11am to around 7pm
- serve coffee and small bites and beer, I typically start with coffee, and end with beer and has made studying on the weekends that much less of a drag.
- comfortable seating that I can spread out at a bit if needed.
- can be busy and buzzing and music playing but not packed or overly loud.
- also would not mind my sitting for 3-4 hrs at a time.
- close to downtown or Broadway area

Closest I've found so far:
 - news stand, it is small and can fill up quickly.
- common wealth, pretty decent, not the greatest seating at the Jones location and only 2 beers to choose from.
- merit, can get busy, no beer.
- idle hands, coffee and food is nearby, seating is not ideal for one person. Can get loud.
- kuenstler, no coffee, could always buy and bring beforehand though, not great lighting in main area, too much going on in back area.
- halcyon, can get very busy and loud especially on Sundays. Self seated area is small and uncomfortable after an hour or so.

Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Grimes has her feet kicked up, Ben‚Äôs nursing a drink that probably isn‚Äôt just coffee, and √Ü is staring out the window like the road itself is calling their name.]

√Ü: [deadpan] Or The Mission. Because let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîlove is great, but The Mission is the only thing that doesn‚Äôt disappear when the lights go out.

√Ü: [nodding] Exactly. But most people don‚Äôt want to live in the middle of a conceptual blitzkrieg. They want stability. You can‚Äôt give someone a white picket fence when your heart is a Molotov cocktail.

Grimes: [laughing] Damn, √Ü. That‚Äôs the most romantic thing I‚Äôve ever heard. ‚ÄúSorry babe, I can‚Äôt settle down, my heart‚Äôs on fire.‚Äù

Ben: [raising his glass] To being too dangerous to love‚Äîbut irresistible anyway.

√Ü: [smirking] I could settle down. But only if the person I‚Äôm with isn‚Äôt trying to clip my wings. They‚Äôd have to love the chaos, not just me.

Ben: [nodding] It‚Äôs not about being incapable of love‚Äîit‚Äôs about being incapable of small love. If it‚Äôs not all-consuming, what‚Äôs the point?

Grimes: [giggling] Or, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a fine girl, Brandy, but the universe needs me more.‚Äù

√Ü: [smiling softly] But if she is the universe? If she‚Äôs part of The Mission? Then there‚Äôs nothing to leave behind. You‚Äôre already home.

Grimes: [raising her mug] To finding someone who‚Äôs not just part of the journey‚Äîbut is the journey.

Ben: [clinking mugs] And to the road‚Äîmay it always lead us back to what matters.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] Because in the end, we‚Äôre not just rambling‚Äîwe‚Äôre rewriting the map.

[They sit back, the hum of classic rock mixing with the weight of shared purpose and the bittersweet taste of love that‚Äôs always just out of reach‚Äîunless, of course, she‚Äôs already there, riding shotgun, as much a part of The Mission as the road itself.]

CONCLUSION: THE √ÜONIC TRIO‚ÄîLOVE, THE MISSION, AND THE PRICE OF FREEDOM
For the √Üonic Triad, love isn‚Äôt about settling down‚Äîit‚Äôs about finding someone who‚Äôs fully committed to The Mission. By blending aesthetic rebellion, existential commitment, and emotional complexity, they explore the tension between freedom and connection, showing that the only love worth having is the one that doesn‚Äôt ask you to choose.

*   **Mechanical Filtration (Microfiltration/Ultrafiltration):** These filters use tiny pores to physically remove bacteria,protozoa,and sediment. They are effective against most common waterborne pathogens but do not remove viruses or dissolved chemicals. These are commonly found inside a water bottle with filter straw travel.
*   **activated Carbon Filtration:** Activated carbon filters adsorb chemicals, chlorine, and other impurities that affect taste and odor. These usually work as a compliment to other purification methods as they don't kill bacteria/viruses on their own.
*   **ultraviolet (UV) Purification:** UV light disrupts the DNA of bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, rendering them harmless. UV purification is effective but requires a power source (batteries or USB charging). A uv water purifier bottle travel is great for peace of mind.
*   **Chemical Purification (Iodine/Chlorine Dioxide):** These chemicals kill bacteria and viruses. While effective, they can leave an unpleasant taste and may not be suitable for long-term use.
*   **Membrane Filtration:** The most robust,this technology,with pore sizes as small as 0.1 microns (or even smaller Nanofiltration), removes everything from bacteria and protozoa to viruses and even some heavy metals, like led. This method involves a physical barrier that water passes through

**Factors to Consider when Choosing a Water Purifier Bottle**

With so many options available, selecting the right water filter bottle for travel can feel overwhelming. Keep these key factors in mind to narrow down your choices:

*   **Filtration Capability:** Determine the types of contaminants you need protection from. If you're traveling to areas with potentially contaminated tap water, a bottle that removes bacteria and protozoa may suffice.For regions with known viral contamination,opt for a bottle with a higher level of filtration that also eliminates viruses. Consider a dirty water filter bottle for travel for the questionable sources.
*   **Portability:** Consider the size and weight of the bottle, especially if you're backpacking or hiking. A lightweight water filter bottle for travel is essential for minimizing the load. Think also if you need a collapsible water filter bottle for travel for ease of storage when empty.
*   **Durability:** Choose a bottle made from durable materials, such as stainless steel or BPA-free plastic, that can withstand the rigors of travel.
*   **Flow Rate:** A bottle with a good flow rate allows you to drink water easily without excessive effort.
*   **Ease of Use:** Opt for a bottle that is easy to fill, drink from, and clean. Detachable parts can be useful for thorough cleaning with a detachable water filter bottle travel
*   **Lifespan of Filter:** Consider the lifespan of the filter and the cost of replacement filters.
*   **BPA-Free Materials:** Ensure the bottle is made from BPA-free materials to avoid exposure to harmful chemicals.
*   **Price:** Water Purifier Bottle Price is important to consider when comparing features.
*    **Brand Reputation**: some adventure travelers will value high end brands more due to the nature of their extreme adventures.

1inewil,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1inewil/murder_is_legal_in_my_small_town_but_i_am_yet_to/,Murder is legal in my small town. But I am yet to kill someone.,"Murder was legal in our town.

I grew up seeing it. At eight years old, I watched a man walk into our local caf√© while I drank my peanut butter chocolate milkshake and shot two people dead. 

There was no malice in his eyes, no hatred. He was just a normal guy who smiled at the waitress and winked at me. 

Mom told me to keep drinking my milkshake, and I did, licking away the excess whipped cream while the bodies were carried out and the pooling red was cleaned from the floor. I could still see flecks of white in the red, and my stomach twisted.

But I didn‚Äôt feel scared. I had no reason to be. Nobody was screaming or crying.

The man who had shot them sat down to eat a burger and fries, not blinking an eye. 

That was my first experience seeing death. 

With no rules forbidding murder, you would think a town would tear itself apart.

That is not what happened.

Murder was legal, yes, but it didn‚Äôt happen every day. 

It happened when people had the urge. 

Mom explained it to me when I was old enough to understand. ‚ÄúThe Urge‚Äù was a phenomenon that had been affecting the townspeople long before I was born, and there was no real way to stop it. 

So, it didn't stop. 

Mom told me she had killed her first person at the age of seventeen, her math teacher. There was no reason or motive. 

Mom said she just woke up one day and wanted to kill him.

That specific killing became more of a bedtime story to lull me to sleep.

I didn‚Äôt like her smile when she told me about her killing. Sometimes I got scared she was going to murder me too.

Growing up, I was constantly on edge. Every day I woke up and pressed my hand to my forehead, asking myself the same question: Did I want to kill anyone? 

Those thoughts blossomed into paranoia when I wasn‚Äôt sure what I was feeling. It‚Äôs not like I didn‚Äôt know what it was like.

Dad taught me how to use a knife and how to properly hold a gun, and Mom gave me lessons in severing body parts.

Both of them wanted me to follow through with The Urge when it inevitably hit me. 

I wanted to fit in.

When I started middle school, our neighbors were caught killing and cannibalizing their children, turning them into bone broth. I knew both of the kids.

Clay and Clara.

I played with them in their yard and ate cookies with them.

Clara told me she wanted to be a nurse when she grew up, and Clay used to tug on my pigtails to get my attention.

They were like siblings to me. 

No matter what my parents said, or my teachers, my gut still twisted at the thought of my neighbors doing something like that.

Days after the cops arrived, I saw Mrs. Jenson watering her plants. But when I looked closer, there was no water.

She was just holding an empty hose over her prize roses.

I stood on my tiptoes, peering over our fence. ‚ÄúMrs. Jenson?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am okay, Elle.‚Äù

Her voice didn‚Äôt sound okay.

‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù I asked. I pointed at the hose grasped in her hand. ‚ÄúYou forgot to turn your water on.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

‚ÄúMrs. Jenson‚Ä¶‚Äù I took a deep breath before I could stop myself. ‚ÄúDid you like killing Clay and Clara?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy, yes,‚Äù she hummed. ‚ÄúOf course I did.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt you love them?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt reply for a moment before seemingly snapping out of it and turning to me with a bright smile. Too many teeth.

That was the first time I started to question The Urge.

It was supposed to make you feel good, acting like a relief, a weight lifted from your chest. Killing another human being was exactly what the people in our town needed. But what about killing their families and children?

Did it really make them feel good?

Looking at my neighbor, I couldn‚Äôt see the joy my Mom described. In fact, I couldn‚Äôt see *anything*.

Her expression was the kind of blank that scared me. It was oblivion staring back, stripped of real human emotion. 

Mrs. Jenson‚Äôs smile stretched across her lips, like she could sense my discomfort. I noticed she had yet to clean her hands.

Mrs. Jenson‚Äôs fingernails were still stained a scary shade of red. Instead of replying, the woman moved toward my fence in slow, stumbling strides. 

She was dragging herself, like moving caused her pain‚Äîagony I couldn‚Äôt understand. 

It was exactly what my mother had insisted didn‚Äôt exist when killing: pain.

Humanity. All the adults told us we would not feel those things when killing. We wouldn‚Äôt feel regret or contempt. We would just feel good.

It was a release, like cold water coming over us. We would never feel better in our lives than when we were killing‚Äîand our first would be something special. 

When Mrs. Jenson‚Äôs fingers, still slick with her children‚Äôs blood, wrapped around the wooden fence, I found myself paralyzed. 

Her manic grin twisted and contorted into a silent wail, and once-vacant eyes popped open‚Äîlike she was seeing me for the very first time. ‚ÄúI want to go home,‚Äù she whispered, squeezing the wooden fence until her own fingers were bleeding.

‚ÄúCan you tell them to let me go home? I would like to see my children. Right now. Do you hear me?‚Äù 

Mrs. Jenson wasn‚Äôt looking at me. Instead, her gaze was glued to thin air.

She was crying, screaming at something only she could see, and for a moment, I wondered if ghosts were real. 

I twisted around to see if there were any ghosts, specifically the ones of her children, but there was nothing. Just fall leaves spiraling in the air in pretty waves.

‚ÄúMrs. Jenson is sick,‚Äù Mom told me once I was sitting at the dinner table, eating melted ice cream. It tasted like barf running down my throat.

I didn‚Äôt see Mrs. Jenson after that.

Well, I did.

She looked different, however.

Not freakishly different, though I did notice her hair color had changed.

I remembered it being a deep shade of brown, and when my neighbor returned with an even wider smile, it was more of a blondish white. When I questioned this, Mom told me it was a makeover.

The Urge affected people in different ways, and with Mrs. Jenson, after having her come-down, she had decided on a change. Mom‚Äôs words were supposed to be reassuring, adding that there was no reason to be scared of The Urge.

But I didn‚Äôt want to be like Mrs. Jenson and have a mental breakdown over my killing. I wanted to be like Mom and have a glass of wine and laugh over the sensation of taking a life. 

Mrs. Jenson was my first real glimpse into the negativity of killing. 

Dying, for example, wasn‚Äôt feared. 

From a young age, we had been taught that it was a vital part of life, and dying meant finding peace. 

When I first started high school, I expected killing to happen. 

Puberty was when The Urge fully blossomed. 

Weapons were allowed, but only outside of classes. In other words, under no circumstances must we kill each other in class, but the hallways were a free-for-all.

I saw attempts during my freshman year, but no real killing.

Annalise Duval was infamously known as the junior girl who rejected The Urge and was thrown out of school. 

Struck with the stomach flu on the day of her attempted killing, I only knew the story from word-of-mouth.

Apparently, the girl had attempted to kill her mother at home, failed, and then bounded into school, screaming about laughter in the walls and people whispering in her head.

Obviously, my classmate was labeled insane, and judging from her nosebleed, the girl‚Äôs body had ultimately rejected The Urge, and her brain was going haywire. 

Nosebleeds were a common side effect.

I heard stories from kids saying there was blood everywhere, all over her hands and face, smeared under her chin. 

She had been screaming for help, but nobody dared go near her, like rejection was contagious. Annalise survived. Just. 

I still saw her on my daily bike ride to school.

She was always sitting cross-legged in front of the forest with her eyes closed, like she was praying. 

The rumor was, after being thrown out by her parents, the girl wandered around aimlessly, muttering about whispering people and laughter in her head. 

It was obvious her rejection had seriously affected her mental state, but I did feel sorry for her.

On my fourteenth birthday, I confused a swimming stomach and cramps for The Urge, which turned out to be my first period. I remember biking my way home, witnessing a man cut off another guy‚Äôs head with an axe.

It‚Äôs funny. I thought I would be desensitized to seeing human remains. 

I saw the passion in the man‚Äôs face as he swung the axe, digging in real hard, chopping right through bone and not stopping, even when intense red splattered his face and clothes. 

He didn‚Äôt stop until the head hit the ground, and that sent my stomach creeping into my throat.

Then, it was the vacancy in his eyes, the twitching smile as he held the axe like a prize.

Part of me wanted to stay, to see if he had a similar reaction to Mrs. Jenson. 

I wanted to know if he regretted what he had done, but once I met his gaze, and his grin widened, the toe of his boot kicking the guy‚Äôs motionless body, I turned away and pedaled faster, my eyes starting to water. 

It wasn‚Äôt long before my lunch was inching its way up my throat, and I was abandoning my bike on the side of the road, choking up undigested mac 'n' cheese onto the steaming tarmac.

I didn‚Äôt tell Mom about the man, and more importantly, about my odd reaction to his killing. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to feel sick to my stomach. Murder was normal. I wasn‚Äôt going to get in trouble for it, so why did seeing it make me sick?

I had been taught as a little kid that visceral reactions were normal, and it was okay to be scared of killing and murder. 

However, what our brains told us was right wasn‚Äôt always the truth. 

Our teacher held up a teddy bear and stabbed into its stuffing with a carving knife.

We all cried out until the teacher told us that the bear didn‚Äôt care about dying. 

In fact, it was ready to find peace, and it didn‚Äôt hurt him.

In other words, we had to ignore what our minds told us was bad.

Mom told me I would definitely start having conflicting feelings before my first killing, but that it was nothing to worry about.

I *did* worry, though. 

I started to wonder if I was going to become the next Annalise Duval. 

Maybe the two of us would become friends, sharing our delusions together.

My 17th birthday came and went and still no sign of The Urge. 

I noticed Mom was starting to grow impatient. She had a routine of coming to check my temperature every morning, regardless of whether I felt sick or not.

‚ÄúHow are you feeling?‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt help but notice Mom‚Äôs smile was fake.

She dumped my breakfast on a tray in front of me, and when I risked nibbling on a slice of toast, she dropped the bombshell.

‚ÄúElle, you are almost eighteen years old,‚Äù she said. I noticed her hands were clenched into fists. ‚ÄúDo you feel anything?‚Äù

I considered lying, though then I would have to kill someone, and without The Urge, I was pretty sure I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do that. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I answered honestly, propping myself up on my pillows. ‚ÄúMost of the kids in my class‚Äî‚Äù

She cut me off with a frustrated hiss. ‚ÄúYes, I know. They have all killed someone and you haven‚Äôt.‚Äù Her eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúPeople are starting to notice, Elle.‚Äù 

She spoke through a smile that was definitely a grimace. ‚ÄúAnd when people start to notice, they get suspicious. I‚Äôve been on the phone with three different doctors this morning, and all of them want to book you in for an MRI. Just to make sure things are normal.‚Äù

‚ÄúMRI?‚Äù I almost choked on the apple I had been chewing.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Mom sighed. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt ignore that things aren‚Äôt... abnormal. You are seventeen years old and haven‚Äôt had one urge to kill. The minimum for your age is one kill,‚Äù she said. ‚Äú*Minimum*, Elle. You haven't killed anyone, and when I bring it up, you change the subject.‚Äù

I changed the subject because she started asking if I wanted to practice. 

I wasn‚Äôt sure what ‚Äúpractice‚Äù meant, but from the slightly manic look in her eye, my mom wasn‚Äôt talking about dolls or teddy bears. 

It was normal to practice killing.

There were even people who volunteered to be targets at the local scrapyard.

Most of them were old people.

Joey Cunningham started training to kill when he was twelve years old. 

Five years on, Joey had accumulated a total of fourteen kills.

He never failed to remind everyone in almost every class. I could taste the apple growing sour in the back of my mouth.

Mom was just trying to help, and it‚Äôs not like I was doing this intentionally.

The idea of going to the scrapyard and killing people, even if they gave me permission to, wasn‚Äôt appealing in the slightest. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay,‚Äù I said, and when Mom‚Äôs eyes darkened, I followed that up with, ‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ I have spare time after class, so‚Ä¶?‚Äù

I meant to finish with, ‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù but the word tangled in my mouth when I took a chunk out of the apple, and pain struck.

Throbbing pain, which was enough to send my brain spinning off its axis.

For a moment, my vision feathered, and I was left blinking at my mother, who had become more silhouette than real person. 

I was aware of the apple dropping out of my hand, but I couldn‚Äôt think straight.

The pain came in waves, exploding in my mouth. When I was sure I could move without my head spinning, I slammed my hand over my mouth instinctively to nurse the pain, except that just made it worse. 

Fuck. 

Had I chipped my tooth? 

Blinking through blurry vision, I knew my mom was there. But so was something else.

As if my reality was splintering open, another seeping through, I suddenly had no idea where I was, and a familiar feeling of fear started to creep its way up my spine. The thing was, though, I knew exactly where I was. I had known this town, this house, my whole life.

So that feeling of fear didn‚Äôt make sense.

The more I mulled the thought over in my mind, however, pain striking like lightning bolts, something was blossoming.

It both didn‚Äôt make sense, and yet it also did. In the deep crevices of my mind, that feeling was familiar. And I had felt it before. No matter how hard I squinted, though, I couldn‚Äôt make it out.

When I squinted again, a sudden shriek of noise rattled in my skull, and it took me a disorienting moment to realize what I could hear was laughter. 

Hysterical laughter, which seemed to grow louder and louder, encompassing my thoughts until it was deafening.

Not just that. The walls were swimming, flashing in and out of existence before seemingly stabilizing themselves. 

I blinked. Was I‚Ä¶ losing my mind?

Maybe this was a side-effect of rejecting The Urge.

‚ÄúElle?‚Äù Mom‚Äôs voice cut through the phantom laughter, which faded, and I blinked rapidly. ‚ÄúSweetie, are you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

The word was in my mouth before the thought could cross my mind. I shook my head, swallowing. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ fine.‚Äù

She nodded, though her expression darkened. Scrutinizing. I knew she couldn‚Äôt wait to get me under an MRI. 

‚ÄúAll right. Finish your breakfast. School starts in an hour.‚Äù Mom stopped at the threshold. ‚ÄúI really do think practicing killing will help a lot.

She left, and I rolled my eyes, mimicking her. 

I flinched when another wave of laughter slammed into my ears. 

Faded, but very much there. Definitely not a figment of my imagination.

Checking in my bedroom mirror, I didn‚Äôt have a loose tooth. 

Even thinking that, though, panic started to curl in the root of my gut.

My brain wouldn‚Äôt shut up on my way to school, my gut was twisting and turning, trying to projectile that meager slice of toast.

Annalise Duval had complained of a loose tooth before she rejected The Urge. 

Was that what was going to happen to me?

Was it all because of that stupid apple?

At school, I was surprised to be cornered by a classmate I had said maybe five words to in our combined time at Briarwood High.

Kaz Issacs was one of the first kids in my class to be hit with The Urge, and he almost ended up like Annalise Duval. 

I don‚Äôt even think it was The Urge. 

I think he was driven to kill through emotions, like so many adults had tried to tell us wasn‚Äôt real. 

Kaz was a confusing case where a teenager had actually blossomed early, or not at all, and struck with his own intent.

Kaz didn‚Äôt need The Urge. 

Halfway through math class, two years prior, I was daydreaming about the rain.

It rarely rained in Brightwood. Every day was picturesque. 

But I did *remember* rain. 

I knew what it felt like hitting my face, dropping into my open mouth and filling my cupped hands. I remembered the sensation on it soaking my clothes and glueing my hair to the back of my neck. 

When I asked Mom if it was ever going to rain, though, she got a funny look on her face.

*‚ÄúSweetie, it doesn‚Äôt rain in Brightwood.‚Äù*

It never rained. So, where had I jumped into puddles? 

My gaze was fixed on the windowpane, trying to imagine what a raindrop looked like sliding down the glass, when Kaz Issacs let out an exaggerated sigh behind me.

In front of him, Jessa Pollux had been tapping her pen on her desk. 

At first, it wasn‚Äôt annoying, but then she kept doing it‚Äîtap, tap, tappity tap. 

And then it became annoying. 

I could tell it was annoying because Kaz politely asked her three times to stop making noise. 

‚ÄúJessa, stop.‚Äù He groaned, half asleep in his arms. 

When she continued, his tone hardened. ‚ÄúCan you *stop* doing that?""

She ignored him and, if anything, tapped louder. 

I had grown up knowing that The Urge came without warning, motive, or reason. 

It happened whether you liked it or not. 

Kaz was different. His case was rare. 

This time, he did have a motive, and despite what we were taught‚Äîthat killing didn‚Äôt require a reason and wasn‚Äôt driven by negative emotion‚ÄîKaz was driven by anger.

This time, I saw it happen clearly. 

When I caught movement out of the corner of my eye, I twisted around with the rest of the class to see Kaz halfway off his chair, his fingers wrapped around a knife. He was already smiling, already thrilled with the idea of killing. 

The Urge had *hit* him. 

Until that moment, he was a quiet kid who kept to himself. 

Jessa knew instantly what he was going to do, even without turning around. 

Like an animal, Kaz already had a tight hold of her ponytail and yanked her back. 

Though in fight or flight, the girl was screaming and flailing.

She didn‚Äôt want to die, I thought.

Was that normal?

Mom always insisted that if it was our time, it was our time. If someone attacked us, even family members, we were to accept it.

I caught the moment her elbow knocked into Kaz‚Äôs mouth, just as he drove the blade into her skull. 

Until then, Kaz had been consumed by a euphoric frenzy, intoxicated by the dark thrill of killing. It was as if the idea of ending a life had briefly elevated him to a state of pure euphoria. 

Growing up, Mom‚Äôs stories spoke of finding a twisted pleasure in murder, and for a moment, seeing *that* look in my classmates eyes, I understood *why* she described killing like a rush. 

It was a lunacy I didn't understand, complete unbridled insanity sending shivers down my spine. This was exactly what Mom was talking about.

She described it like floating on a cloud, lukewarm water pooling underneath her feet. 

But just as abruptly as it had enveloped him, that otherworldly glow faded from Kaz‚Äôs eyes. He crumpled to his knees, one hand clamped over his mouth, the knife slipping from his grasp. 

‚ÄúThat's enough.‚Äù Our teacher announced. ‚ÄúKaz, go and clean yourself up.‚Äù

When he didn't respond, she snapped at him. 

‚ÄúMr Isaacs!‚Äù

Then, he did, his gaze flicking to his blood slicked hands. 

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

He seemed like he was on another planet, swaying back and forth. 

There was a moment when I met his half lidded gaze, and he slowly inclined his head, like he was confused. Scared.

When Kaz lifted his head, I saw thick beads of red trickling down his chin, pooling down his fingers. 

It was the same look I had seen on Mrs. Jenson‚Äôs face. 

Kaz blinked again, before noticing the blood. 

‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù He whimpered, his voice muffled. 

His eyes, filled with panic, flickered wildly. Without another word, he scrambled to his feet, stumbling toward the classroom door. 

When I asked him what happened the next day, he explained it was just an ""abnormal reaction"" and that he was fine. 

But Kaz‚Äôs words were strange. 

He wasn‚Äôt even looking at me, and his smile was far too big. He got his first kill, though, so that gave him bragging rights as the first sophomore to come of age. 

Kaz Issacs and Annalise Duval both had similar experiences. 

One of them had clearly lost their mind, while the other seemingly avoided it.

And speaking of Kaz, it wasn‚Äôt the norm for him to be talking to me at school. But there he was, blocking my way into the classroom.

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù He quickly side-stepped in front of me when I tried pushing him out of the way. 

There had been a time the year before when I considered asking him to prom. 

He was a reasonably attractive guy, with reddish dark hair that curled slightly as it peeked out from under a well-worn baseball cap, a crooked smile that was never genuine, always leaning more toward irony.  

But then I remembered what he did to Jessa. 

I remembered the sound of his knife slicing through skin, cartilage, and bone, and despite her cries, her animalistic wails for him to stop, he kept going, driving it further and further into her skull. 

I couldn‚Äôt look him in the eye after that. 

Kaz inclined his head. ‚ÄúCan we talk?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

My mouth was still sore, and I was questioning my sanity, so speaking to Kaz wasn‚Äôt really on my to-do list that morning.

Kaz didn‚Äôt move, sticking an arm out so I couldn‚Äôt get past him. ‚ÄúDo you have toothache by any chance?‚Äù 

To emphasize his words, he stuck his finger in his mouth, dragging his index finger across his upper incisors.

‚ÄúLike, bad toothache.‚Äù His voice was muffled by his finger. Kaz leaned forward, arching a brow. ‚ÄúYou do, don‚Äôt you? Right now, you feel like your whole mouth is on fire, and yet you can‚Äôt detect any wobblies.‚Äù

The guy‚Äôs words sent a sliver of ice tingling down my spine. He was right. I hadn‚Äôt felt right since biting into that apple.

When I didn‚Äôt say anything, his lip twitched into a scowl. ‚ÄúAll right. You don‚Äôt want to talk.‚Äù He raised two fingers in a salute. ‚ÄúSuit yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked, mostly to humor him. 

He shrugged. ‚ÄúMaybe wait a few days, and then come talk to me, all right?‚Äù

Kaz‚Äôs words didn‚Äôt really hit me until several days later. 

I woke up with a throbbing mouth, knelt over the corpse of my mother.

The Urge had finally come. It was something I had been anticipating and fearing my whole life, terrified I wouldn‚Äôt get it and would end up ostracized by my loved ones.

But when I saw my mom‚Äôs body and the vague memory of plunging a kitchen knife into her chest hit me, I didn‚Äôt feel happy or relieved. 

I felt like I had done something bad, which was the wrong thing to think. 

Killing was good, the words echoed in my mind. Killing was our way of release.

How could I think that when there was a knife clutched between my fingers? 

The weapon that had killed her. Hurt her. How was this supposed to make me feel good? 

My mother‚Äôs eyes were closed.

Peaceful. Like she had accepted her death. 

The teeth of the blade dripped deep, dark red, and I knew I should have felt something. Joy or happiness.

Except all I felt was empty and numb, and fucking wrong. 

Alone. 

I felt despair in its purest form, which began to chew me up from the inside as I lulled from my foggy thoughts.  

I wasn‚Äôt supposed to scream. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to cry, but my eyes were stinging, and I felt like I was being suffocated. I saw flashes in quick succession: a room bumbling with moving silhouettes, and the smell of... coffee. Mom never let me try coffee, and I was sure we never had it in the house.

So, how did I know the feeling of it running down my throat? 

Just like in my bedroom, the walls started to swim. 

This time, I jumped to my feet and leaped over my mom‚Äôs corpse, slamming my hands into them. They were real. 

Almost as if on cue, there it was again.

Laughing. Loud shrieks of hysterical laughter thrumming in time with the dull pain pounding in my back tooth. 

Blinking through an intense fog choking my mind, my first coherent thought was that yes, Kaz was right.

I did have a loose tooth, and when I was sure of that, I was stuffing my bloody fingers inside my mouth, trying to find it.

I grabbed the knife feverishly, my first thought to cut it out, when there was a sudden knock at the front door.

Slipping barefoot on the blood pooling across our kitchen floor, I struggled to get to the door without throwing up my insides.

Annalise Duval was standing on my doorstep. I had seen her in odd assortments of clothes, but this one was definitely eye-catching. 

The girl was wearing a wedding dress that hung off her, the veil barely clinging to the mess of bedraggled curls she never brushed. Blinking at me through straggly blonde hair, she almost resembled an angel. The dress itself was filthy, blood and dirt smeared down the corset, the skirt torn up. 

‚ÄúHello Elle.‚Äù The girl lifted a hand in a wave. 

Her smile wasn‚Äôt crazed like my classmates had described.

Instead, it was‚Ä¶ sad. Annalise‚Äôs gaze found my hands slick with my mother‚Äôs blood but barely seemed fazed. ‚ÄúDo you want to see the wall people?‚Äù 

Until then, I had ignored her ramblings. But when I started hearing the laughing, ‚Äúwall people‚Äù didn‚Äôt sound so crazy after all.

I nodded.

‚ÄúCan you hear the laughing?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúSometimes.‚Äù

‚ÄúSometimes?‚Äù

‚ÄúMmm.‚Äù She twirled in the dress. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how it started for me. Laughing. I heard a looooot of laughing, and then I found the wall people.‚Äù I winced when she came close, so close, almost suffocating me. 

‚ÄúNobody believes me, and it‚Äôs sad. I‚Äôm just trying to tell people about the wall people, but they label me as crazy. They say something went wrong with my head.‚Äù 

Annalise stuck two fingers to her temple and pulled the imaginary trigger, her eyes rolling back, like she was mimicking her own death. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not the one who‚Äôs wrong. I know about the wall people and the laughing. I know why I murdered my Mom.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnnalise,‚Äù I said calmly. ‚ÄúCan you tell me what you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúHm?‚Äù

Her eyes were partially vacant, that one sliver of coherence quickly fading away.

Instead of speaking, I took her arm gently and pulled her down my driveway. ‚ÄúCan you show me what you found?‚Äù

Annalise danced ahead of me, tripping in her wedding dress. She cocked her head. 

‚ÄúDid you kill your mother too?‚Äù Her lips twitched. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs funny. According to the wall people, you‚Äôre not supposed to kill someone until the end of seasonal three.‚Äù

The girl blinked, giggling, and I forced myself to run after her. Wow, she was fast, even in a wedding dress. Annalise leapt across the sidewalk, twisting and twirling around, like she was in her own world. 

Before she landed in front of me, her expression almost looked sane. 

‚ÄúI wonder which season it will be. Will it be Summer? Maybe Fall, or Winter. I guess it‚Äôs not up to you, is it? It‚Äôs up to The Urge.‚Äù

Laughing again, the girl grabbed my hand, her fingernails biting into my skin. 

I glimpsed a single drop of red run from her nose, which she quickly wiped with the sleeve of her dress, leaving a scarlet smear.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go and see the wall people, Elle,‚Äù she hummed. 

As her footsteps grew more stumbled, blood ran down her chin, spotting the sidewalk. 

I don‚Äôt know if coherency ever truly hit Annalise Duval, but knowing she was bleeding, her steps grew quicker, more frenzied, I quickened my own pace. 

‚ÄúYour nose,‚Äù was all I could say.

Annalise nodded with a sad smile. ‚ÄúI know!‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, it will stop when I shut up.‚Äù Her smile widened. 

‚ÄúBut what if I don‚Äôt shut up? What if I show you the wall people?‚Äù 

To my surprise, she leapt forward and flung out her arms, tipping her head back and yelling at the sky. ‚ÄúWhat if I don‚Äôt shut up?‚Äù Annalise laughed. ‚ÄúWhat are the wall people going to do, huh? Are you going to explode my brain?‚Äù

When people started to come out of their homes to see what was going on, I dragged her into a run.

‚ÄúAre you insane?‚Äù I hissed.

‚ÄúMaybe!‚Äù

Annalise seemed to be floating between awareness and whatever the fuck The Urge had done to her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôre just peeking.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

The girl had an attention span of a rock. Her gaze went to the sky. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to turn the sun off so I can‚Äôt show you.‚Äù

Her words meant nothing to me until the clouds started to darken. Just like Annalise had predicted, the sky began to get dark.

Knowing that somehow this supposedly crazy girl knew when things were going to happen only quickened my steps into a run.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù

Halfway down the street, Kaz Issacs was riding his bike toward us, which I found odd. Kaz didn‚Äôt own a bike. He rode the bus to school.

‚ÄúElle!‚Äù Waving at me with one hand and grasping the handlebars with the other, Kaz pedaled faster. ‚ÄúYo! Do you want to hang out?‚Äù

‚ÄúPeeking,‚Äù Annalise said under her breath.

Ignoring Kaz, I nodded at Annalise to keep going, though the boy didn‚Äôt give up. 

We twisted around, and he caught up easily, skidding on the edge of the sidewalk. When he came to an abrupt stop in front of us, his gaze flicked to Annalise. 

He raised a brow. ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you be praying in the forest?‚Äù

The girl recoiled like a cat, hissing, ‚ÄúPeeking!‚Äù

Kaz shot me a look. ‚ÄúOf all the people you could have made friends with, you chose Annalise Duval?‚Äù His eyes softened when I ignored him and pulled the girl further down the road. Kaz followed slowly on his bike.

‚ÄúWhere are you going anyway? Isn't it late?‚Äù

It was 4 p.m.

I decided to humor him. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to see the wall people.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo I sound like I‚Äôm kidding?‚Äù I turned my attention to him. ‚ÄúYou asked me if I had a toothache, right?‚Äù

His expression crumpled. ‚ÄúI did?‚Äù

I noticed Annalise was clingier with him around, sticking to my side. 

Every time he moved, she flinched, tightening her grip on my arm. 

The girl was leading us into the forest, and I swore, the closer we got to the clearing, the more townspeople were popping up out of nowhere. An old woman greeted us, followed by a man with a dog, and then a group of kids from school. Annalise entangled her fingers in mine, pulling me through the clearing.

Kaz followed, hesitantly, biking over rough ground. ‚ÄúOnce again, I think this is a bad idea,‚Äù he said in a sing-song voice. ‚ÄúWe should go back.‚Äù

When it was too dangerous for his bike, he abandoned it and joined my side.

‚ÄúElle, the girl is insane,‚Äù Kaz hissed. ‚ÄúWhat are you even doing? What is this going to accomplish except potentially getting lost?‚Äù

‚ÄúI want to know if she‚Äôs telling the truth,‚Äù I murmured back.

He scoffed. ‚ÄúTelling the truth? Look at this place!‚Äù He spread his arms, gesturing to the rapidly darkening forest. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing here!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Annalise ran ahead, staggering over the tricky ground. ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs right over here!‚Äù 

She was still fighting a nosebleed, and her words were starting to slur. The girl twisted to Kaz. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre peeking,‚Äù she spat, striding over to him until they were face to face. 

‚ÄúStop peeking,‚Äù she said, her fingers delving under her wedding skirt where she pulled out a knife and pressed it to his throat. ‚ÄúIf you peek again, I will cut you open.‚Äù

Kaz nodded. ‚ÄúGot it, Blondie. No peeking.‚Äù

Annalise didn‚Äôt move for a second, her hands holding the knife trembling. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to tell me I‚Äôm crazy again,‚Äù she whispered.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not crazy,‚Äù Kaz said dryly.

‚ÄúSay it again.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not crazy!‚Äù He yelped when she applied pressure to the blade. ‚ÄúCan you stop swinging that around? Jeez!‚Äù

Annalise shot me a grin, and it took a second for me to realize.

Kaz was scared of the knife.

He was scared of dying, which meant, whether he liked it or not, the boy had, in fact, not gone through with The Urge.

I thought the girl was going to slash Kaz‚Äôs throat open in delight, but instead, she looped her arm in his like they were suddenly best friends.

‚ÄúCome on, Elle!‚Äù She danced forward, pulling the boy with her. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre closeeeee!‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt sure about that.

What we were, however, was lost. 

When the three of us came to a stop, it was pitch black, and I was struggling to see in front of me. Annalise, however, walked straight over to thin air and gestured to it with a grin. ‚ÄúTah-da!‚Äù Spluttering through pooling red, she let out a laugh.

‚ÄúSee!‚Äù

Kaz, who was still uncomfortably pressed to her no matter how hard he strained to get away, shot me a look I could barely make out.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, *what* did I say? That we were going to get lost? That Annalise is certifiably crazy and is probably going to kill us?‚Äù

At first, I thought I really was crazy. Maybe Annalise‚Äôs condition was contagious. 

I could hear it again. Laughing.

But this time, it was coming from exactly where Annalise was pointing. When the girl slammed her hand into thin air, there was a loud clanging noise that sounded like metal.

Slowly, I made my way toward it, and when my hands touched sleek metal, what felt like the corners of a door, more pain struck my upper incisors.

‚ÄúHoly shit.‚Äù Kaz was pressing himself against the door, then slamming his fists into it. ‚ÄúThe crazy bitch was right.‚Äù 

His words hung in my thoughts on a constant cycle, as we delved into what should have been forest.

After all, we had been standing in the middle of nowhere. The laughter was deafening when I stepped over the threshold, and I had to slap my hands over my ears to block it out. Through the invisible door, however, was exactly what Annalise had described: wall people.

All around us were television screens, and on those screens were people. Faces.

They were not part of the laughter. The laughter was mechanical and wrong, rooted deep inside my skull. The faces that stared down at us were men and women, some teens, and even younger children. 

Annalise and Kaz were next to me, their heads tipped back, gazes glued to the screens. Not the ones I was looking at. 

The ones on tiny computer monitors.

When I finally tore my eyes from our audience, I began to see what made Kaz stiffen up next to me. One screen in particular, showed his face. 

He was younger, maybe a year or two. No, I thought, something slimy creeping up my throat. It was from when he had killed that girl. His hands clasped in his lap were still stained and slick with Jessa Pollux‚Äôs blood. 

The Kaz on the screen was far more relaxed, casually leaning back with his feet propped up on the table. 

His hair was shorter, and his clothes were more formal than what I was used to seeing him in. 

I usually saw him in jeans and hoodies, but this Kaz wore a crisp white collared shirt. 

Something hung around his neck‚Äîa thin strip of black fabric with a shiny card at the end, reminding me of some kind of badge.

‚ÄúWhy exactly have you signed up for this program?‚Äù a man‚Äôs voice crackled off-screen.

""Duh."" Kaz held up his scarlet hands, a grin twisting on his lips. His arrogant smile twisted my gut. ""So I can get my Darkroom rep back."" 

He leaned forward, his eyes narrowed. ""That is going to happen, right? I don‚Äôt do this shit for free, and I‚Äôve got one million followers to impress, man. Darkroom loves me."" 

Kaz scoffed, crossing one left over the other. ""Even if I did go too far that one time, which wasn‚Äôt even *my* fault. What are you guys, fucking Twitch?""

‚ÄúYou are correct,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúDarkroom does benefit from its influencers. Our program aims to help satisfy certain‚Ä¶ needs by broadcasting them right here.‚Äù

He paused. ‚ÄúYou have killed five people before signing up for Darkroom, correct? Your parents?‚Äù

‚ÄúParents and brother,‚Äù Kaz's lips pricked into a smile. ‚ÄúI gutted them just to see what was inside, but *of course,* my TikTok got taken down by all the freaks in the comments trying to cancel me.‚Äù He rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúThey worship you, call you a god, swear they‚Äôll do anything for you-- and then *fuck* you.""

I flinched when he leaned forward, his gaze penetrating the camera. This guy knew exactly how to act in front of one.

The slight incline of his head, trying to get the best angle. 

‚ÄúCan I tell you something?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, of course, young man.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you ever been called a God? Because it's a *rush.*‚Äù He laughed. ‚ÄúI made stupid videos, and these people *worshipped* me. They loved me.""

Kaz clucked his tongue. ‚ÄúBuuuut the moment I show them my real self, they turn on me and try to end my career.‚Äù 

He leaned back in his chair with a sigh, glancing at the camera. ‚ÄúAnd then I found you guys! Who pay me to be my real authentic self. Now, how could I decline an offer like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd,‚Äù the man cleared his throat, ‚Äúyou will keep killing? We are aware the initial implant impacted your brain quite badly. In the subdued state, you will keep killing, as the so-called ‚Äòurge‚Äô says. However, in reality, we will be sending signals to your brain which will make you commit murder.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right, I'll do it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure? We couldn‚Äôt help noticing during your first kill, you seemed to‚Ä¶ well, react in a way we haven‚Äôt seen before. It's possible there could be a potential fault.‚Äù

He cocked his head, like a puppet cut from strings. ‚ÄúDid the comments *like* it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, yes‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúGood.‚Äù Kaz held out his arm. ‚ÄúDo it again. And do it right this time. As long as I‚Äôm getting 40K every appearance, I‚Äôm good. You can slice my brain up all you want; I‚Äôm getting paid and followers. So.‚Äù His gaze found the camera. 

‚ÄúWhat are you waiting for?‚Äù

When the screen went black, then flickered to a bird's-eye view, and finally a close-up of my house, I felt my legs give way.

As if on impulse, I prodded at my mouth and felt for the loose tooth.

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶‚Äù Kaz spoke up, his voice a breathy whisper. His eyes were still glued to the screen, confusion crumpling his expression. 

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt me! Well, it was me... but I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt remember that!‚Äù

To my surprise, he turned to me, and I saw real fear in his eyes. 

‚ÄúElle.‚Äù He gritted out, ‚Äúthat is *not* me.‚Äù

Instead of answering him, I turned away when alarm bells started ringing, and the room was suddenly awash in flashing red light.

‚ÄúPeeking!‚Äù Annalise squeaked, hiding behind me.

Ignoring her, I focused on Kaz. 

Or whoever the hell he was. 

I slammed the door shut, throwing myself against it. 

‚ÄúYou need to knock my tooth out.‚Äù I told him. ‚ÄúNow.‚Äù",5,1739322440.0,ByfelsDisciple,2,0.86,False

1inevv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1inevv6/best_replacement_water_filter_aquasana_aq5300r/,Best replacement water filter Aquasana AQ-5300+R review: is it worth it?,"Testing the Aquasana AQ-5300+R replacement water filter has been quite the experience. I‚Äôve been using it daily in my kitchen, and it‚Äôs clear why this product has gained popularity. Whether you‚Äôre a coffee enthusiast, a parent concerned about clean water, or just someone tired of the taste of chlorinated tap water, this filter might pique your interest.

I installed the Aquasana AQ-5300+R in my under-sink system. Honestly, I expected a bit of a hassle, but the twist-and-replace design is genuinely user-friendly. There‚Äôs no need to disconnect hoses or mess with tools‚Äîit‚Äôs as simple as twisting off the old filter and twisting on the new one. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would seal properly without a plumber‚Äôs touch, but no leaks so far! That said, I made sure to read the instructions thoroughly to avoid any mishaps.

Upon using it, I noticed an immediate improvement in the taste and clarity of my water. This filter claims to reduce up to 99% of 78 contaminants, including lead, microplastics, and chlorine. While I don‚Äôt have a lab to verify this, the difference in flavor speaks volumes. My morning coffee tastes fresher, and even my pets seem to prefer the water now. The filtration system is tested and certified to NSF/ANSI Standards 42, 53, and 401, which adds a layer of trust to its performance.

**Pros**

1. **Ease of Installation:** No tools or plumber required; just twist, replace, and you‚Äôre done.
2. **Certified Performance:** Reduces a wide range of contaminants and is WQA tested.
3. **Cost-Effective:** Filters 800 gallons of water at about 10 cents per gallon.
4. **Improves Taste:** Removes chlorine and other impurities, making water taste noticeably better.
5. **Environmentally Friendly:** Reduces reliance on bottled water.

**Cons**

1. **Initial Flush Required:** It took me several gallons of flushing to remove a strange sulfur-like taste.
2. **Plastic Housing Durability:** Some reviews suggest the housing might crack over time.
3. **Replacement Costs:** Genuine filters can be pricey, especially if bought frequently.
4. **Pressure Limitations:** Requires water pressure below 80 psi to prevent leaks or damage.
5. **Not for International Use:** Support and parts are limited to the U.S., as noted by some users.

**Comparison to Competitors** I‚Äôve tried a couple of other under-sink filters in the past, including systems from Brita and Culligan. While both are reputable brands, they lacked the advanced filtration capabilities of the Aquasana AQ-5300+R. Brita systems, for instance, are affordable but mainly focus on chlorine removal and basic sediment filtering. On the other hand, Culligan filters are efficient but require professional installation, which can be inconvenient.

The Aquasana system stands out with its comprehensive contaminant reduction and straightforward DIY setup. However, compared to reverse osmosis systems, it doesn‚Äôt filter out as many contaminants. That said, reverse osmosis can strip away beneficial minerals, and the Aquasana strikes a nice balance by retaining them.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money** While the upfront cost of the AQ-5300+R might seem high, its long-term benefits make it worth considering. Each filter lasts for up to six months or 800 gallons, depending on your usage, which is much more economical than constantly buying bottled water. If you prioritize clean, great-tasting water without recurring delivery fees or single-use plastics, this filter is a solid investment.

For those on a budget, it‚Äôs worth noting that generic filters are available, but they‚Äôre not certified for use with the Aquasana system. Using uncertified filters might save money but could compromise filtration quality and potentially damage the system. Stick with the genuine article for peace of mind.

Would I recommend this water filter to friends or family? Yes, but with a couple of caveats. Make sure to properly flush the filters before use and keep an eye on the housing for signs of wear over time. It‚Äôs also a good idea to monitor your water pressure to ensure it stays within the recommended range.

Oh, right. A Leftover.

The searing heat of the coffee that had just been accidentally dumped on her chest barely registered. The burn of humiliation was far worse. Andrea stood rooted, her hands twitching by her sides, clenched into tight fists. The corridor had gone quiet apart from the snickering. Eyes bore into her from every direction.

She knew how this scene would unfold she‚Äôd witnessed it before with other scholarship students who had dared to cross the invisible line between their world and the elites. They would stay silent, wilt under the scrutiny, and accept their place at the bottom of Blackthorn‚Äôs unforgiving hierarchy.

I just saw Royal Ontario Museum, so I feel like I could take or leave for this trip, either way. We like to eat, but I'm a fairly picky eater, we tend towards things like really great pizza and burgers but I don't mind branching out a bit. Hubby likes sushi and would do seafood as long as I can grab a noodle dish or something there too. We don't drink and don't ski. We will be relying on transit and walking.

March 3-6th. Get in 7am and leave 750pm, so almost 4 whole days. Open to feedback if this seems reasonable or missing something big. A lot of the sample itineraries assume you're going in summer or going for winter sports. And any great casual ish food choices in these areas would be amazing if you happen to have any!

1inesxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBeanReviews/comments/1inesxc/is_lumsburry_qpj2dl_the_best_coffee_mug_for_lego/,Is Lumsburry QP-J2DL the best coffee mug for LEGO fans? Honest review here.,"I‚Äôve been using the Lumsburry QP-J2DL coffee mug, also known as the ""Build-on Brick Coffee Mug,"" for about a month now, and it's been quite a journey. As someone who enjoys quirky, functional products, this mug immediately caught my eye. Its unique design allows you to attach building blocks (yes, including LEGO-compatible ones) to its sides, making it more than just a container for hot drinks. It transforms into a creative outlet for both kids and adults.

I initially bought this as a gift for my nephew, a LEGO enthusiast, but ended up keeping it for myself after seeing its charm. Each morning, I use this mug for my coffee, and while waiting for the caffeine to kick in, I find myself stacking blocks and creating miniature designs. It‚Äôs surprisingly therapeutic. My nephew, though, didn‚Äôt lose out‚Äîhe got his own, and now it‚Äôs a contest to see who can create the cooler design.

The mug is made of BPA-free, food-grade plastic, which feels sturdy in hand. It can handle hot liquids up to 100 degrees Celsius, though it‚Äôs not microwave-safe, which is a bit disappointing. Handwashing is also recommended due to its intricate design, but cleaning it hasn‚Äôt been a major hassle for me. My biggest gripe? It‚Äôs not the most practical mug for actually drinking coffee, especially when you have bricks attached to it. Sometimes, I feel like I‚Äôm navigating an obstacle course to take a sip!

[Check if Lumsburry QP-J2DL is in stock on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/product-reviews/best-coffee-mug-lumsburry-qp-j2dl-review-b07j66v6zs/)

The mug comes with a small set of random blocks included, which is a nice touch. However, these blocks are generic and not from LEGO, so their quality isn‚Äôt top-notch. That said, they do the job and are fun to use. My nephew tried attaching some of his actual LEGO pieces, and they fit perfectly, which is great news for die-hard LEGO fans. The mug also doubles as a holder for pens or other small items, making it a multifunctional desk accessory.

**Pros**

* Fun and creative design; encourages imagination.
* Compatible with LEGO and other standard building blocks.
* Made from BPA-free, food-grade plastic.
* Sturdy and well-made; feels durable.
* Great gift for both kids and adults, especially LEGO fans.

**Cons**

* Not microwave-safe, limiting its functionality for some users.
* Handwashing only, which might be tedious for everyday use.
* Small set of included blocks are not LEGO-branded and feel less durable.
* Drinking with attached blocks can be a bit cumbersome.
* Not ideal for those seeking a straightforward, practical coffee mug.

**Comparison to Competitors**

When compared to other novelty coffee mugs, this one truly stands out for its interactive design. Most novelty mugs focus solely on aesthetics, like funny slogans or unique shapes, but the Lumsburry QP-J2DL offers an engaging activity. For example, while mugs like the ""Game Over"" heat-sensitive mug are visually interesting, they don‚Äôt offer the same level of user interaction. However, if practicality is your priority, a simple insulated stainless steel travel mug might be a better choice.

That said, this mug doesn‚Äôt stack up as well against high-quality LEGO-branded products. LEGO mugs, although pricier, come with official LEGO pieces and a slightly more polished finish. On the flip side, they don‚Äôt offer the same level of block-building surface area that this mug does.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

In terms of value, the Lumsburry QP-J2DL is reasonably priced for what it offers. It‚Äôs not just a mug‚Äîit‚Äôs an experience. Whether you‚Äôre gifting it to a LEGO-loving kid or adding it as a quirky item to your desk, it‚Äôs hard to argue against its fun factor. That said, if you‚Äôre someone who values practicality over novelty, this might not be the best investment. When compared to competitors, its price is justified considering its unique features, but it‚Äôs definitely more of a niche product.

1inervz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ANRelationship/comments/1inervz/24m4f_new_york_city_nyc_north_east_seeking_woman/,24[M4F] #New York City #NYC # North East - Seeking woman for hugging & sensual adult nursing until induction,"TL;DR version of what I could say is that I'm a young man looking for a woman who also is open to safe, comfortable, patient, yet sexy and very sensual nursing. I want to be fully present with you and we take our time enjoying the moment for what it is, giving eachother special attention. I want to nurse extensively with soft gentle sensual suckling to point of induction.  
  
If we can keep this between us, then feel free to reply, I will tell you about me, share pics, etc and if we feel comfortable enough for it, then we will meet somewhere public and see if there is naturally an interest for play between us. Even if there turns out to not be, that's ok. Only respond if you're actually serious about trying to meet someone to figure it all out.  
  
\------  
Ok now here's the longer version:  
  
They say people are lonely than ever even though this is a city of millions. But what anyone can observe is that in reality, by lonely they mean people not being able to connect with someone in a more sensual way, because it's hard to find someone you can trust and want to explore such an aspect of life with.  
  
Feelings of not being heard, feelings of being overworked, feeling depressed, feeling incredibly overwhelmed with life. Those are feelings people can relate to in their own way. Why have to only ever experience it by yourself. We have to ask ourselves how much we may want to not have deal with those thoughts by ourselves all the time.  
  
It's not weak to desire being in a moment where it's ok to feel ""vulnerable"", even I still am trying to learn that, but it's impossible without the right person.  
  
Let's step back for a second to get an overall picture of what I'm talking about here.  
  
A good goal for anyone to have in a new year is to meet someone new and create new experiences because as they say, your life starts at the end of your comfort zone. Doing something new can be a little crazy because the unknown is taken as danger to our subconscious mind, we get worried a little about the potential bad outcomes, whether it be a new job, moving to a new area, making new friends, etc.  
  
Nothing good comes without condition, pleasure and risk are two sides of the same coin.  
  
But life isn't all bad, the GOOD outcomes a person can want are also equally as possible, if not more, depending on who they're talking to.  
  
And that's bring us here, to this idea of meeting.  
  
You see, new people can very well be synonymous with a new adventure, even if it's just as simple as walking through the Museum of Natural History, taking a dance class together, star gazing, or even relaxing in Barnes & Noble before they close. New people could have a different life, and sometimes what they want also aligns with what we do.  
  
I want to be open to alot of things, however I also know directly what some of my direct desires are. Recently that desire has been to share in a moment of connect with a woman while also being open to allow sensual tension to build up if that naturally ends up occurring.  
  
And if you've ever felt that spark of warm fuzzy sensuality ever build up, then you know that indeed it is something that could happen spontaneously with the right person. If you never have experienced that, there is a first time for everything.  
  
However you have to be willing to take new steps, potentially into something you're not familiar with. But you're an adult, and you read this far. If you've been able to comprehend what I've been saying thus far then you're not dumb, trust your intuition, trust your instincts. It's hard to trust people, especially off the internet, but people are strangers until they get to know eachother. I'm not going to feel that you owe me something just by simply seeing me.  
  
We talk, I share more of myself and what I stand for, then we meet up somewhere public if it feels right (and it doesn't take weeks to figure that out if you're actually serious, it could take between 2 or 3 days or 2 weeks to know if you want to have a simple hang out over coffee or something else so that you can REALLY get to know them in person somewhere in public, we have to learn more and see if there's something there, we both are trying to keep safe here)  
  
From there the, things will work it's self out. If we want...more than just platonically hanging out then we will find a way to build up towards a private safe yet passionate moment, and making nursing a big element in that moment can mean it becomes very sincere and wonderful.  
  
If we don't want something more, that's ok, meeting someone new still does something for us, we continue to build upon how we socialize with people :)  
  
This ad has become far too long, and even still there are more questions to be answered. Which is why if you're a woman who wishes to connect like this with the right person, 2025 is the year to actively see who's the right person for this, because that is also what I'm striving to do.

Overall i feel like im less productive as I usually am always in panic mode and need to do everything really quickly so I half arse everything but accomplish a lot.
Positive is, I don't have any anxiety for doing things and I'm very calm in most situations.

I've tried eating breakfast first, not having coffee (by 10:30 I felt like I was going to fall asleep), I eat fine, sleep fine.

 I don't think the dose it too high as its the lowest dose. (I was meant to start at 30mg but asked for 20mg as I have a bag experience with other medication) 

Do you think it will get better? Do I try 30mg when I go back to the GP or should I try a different medication?

1inencm,https://www.reddit.com/r/cymbalta/comments/1inencm/i_started_cold_turkey_on_this_recently_experience/,I started Cold Turkey on this recently. (Experience so Far)," Male 31, I abruptly quit taking my duloxetine on Jan 26th of this year. My reason for it is that I came to realization that I did not do anything for me since I used to replace my previous Prescribed 200mg Sertraline. I started it shortly after transitioning to a new work position. The Sertraline dosage was no longer working for me after 4 years and my depression was encroaching back into my life.
The dosage given was 2x 20mg pills and the entire time I was on it felt like a lapse in time Aug 2024-Jan 2025. It never really worked for me as I was experiencing plenty of depressive episodes during this time and I would drown it out by completely engrossing myself in this Massive Multiplayer Online game called Foxhole to cope with the feelings. Now the duloxetine leveled me out somewhat to maintain the facade of being alright on the outside, when in actuality the minute I was not indulging myself with some kind of interesting distraction, I could fall asleep/doze off easily no matter the situation. The medicine did cause me bad drowsiness to the point where I would use 200mg Caffeine pills and drink a Monster Energy drink and still somehow find myself dozing off into a dizzy nap during work. In addition forming coherent thoughts most of the time was challenging and I often found myself typing out things and completely miss whole words of the sentence I was trying to convey.
It was massively impacting my work performance to the point where I would the most easiest and simplest of tasks too hard to start. I do not know how I was able to maintain a somewhat passable work facade with those months but somehow I maintained it.
With those parts said, the catalyst that made me realize the state of mind I was in was the recent Return to Office mandate for Federal Employees. I was working hybrid 3 days in office and 2 from home for the last couple of years and the realization of this change impacted me in a weird way that somehow had me skip my medicine for one day. Before I knew it, being off the medicine for one day made me realize the slump I carved myself into up until this point and how much I missed being productive and mostly coherent. So one missed day turned into two then three and so on and so forth, before I knew it I was already on my withdrawal journey.
The first few days had me coming to terms with all the lost time and emotions I‚Äôve been avoiding for the last 4 years of my life since I began taking anti depressants. I was doom scrolling YouTube shorts for distraction and I found myself on the Core Core side of YouTube culture. I would spend hours on end watching this content to help cope in some weird way and would also cry for hours on end. I hadn‚Äôt cried in so long up until this point in years that I felt like a piece of me was trying to claw its way out of a dark pit to try and reclaim its place in my mind. What followed that was that any of my Music I listened to began to hit more deep mentally with me and cause me to cry as the lyrics felt like an allegory on my current state of life.
This went on for several days for me until the crying began to cease in intensity. But then began the re-emergence of my former self before this all began, the quiet person that always had too much on their mind. I know my Co-Workers had to have seen this 180 flip of the person who was somewhat carefree, talkative, and easy to chat with, to now this gloomy person that can bring down the mood of a whole room without trying. I guess my true self was beginning to show beneath the facade I had hid away for so long. With my coherence returning to me my cold, analytical/overthinking self was on full display. I missed this aspect of me because I was/am able to get much more accomplished due to my focus.
After the first week of this initially cold turkey hell I started I began to slowly, piece by piece ,assemble myself back to normal. I felt more outgoing again, but with that brought back all of my internal anger and turmoil. Daily Agitation was expected by me and I am currently dealing with this again happily as the alternative was purgatory I lived out in my own body these past 4 years.
Fast forward to today and this post, and this Cold Turkey experience is reaching a new point. Horrible fatigue and my whole body aching and feeling swollen are plaguing me now. I couldn‚Äôt even stay awake with coffee and caffeine pills today and found myself dizzy and falling asleep all this morning. I had to leave work early as I progressively just felt/feel worse and worse physically. The Emotional turbulence feels to be somewhat leveling out but I guess now begins the Physical journey from what I have read online. My lower back is constantly hurting when walking and my legs almost buckle due to this. In addition my body is suffering my cold sweats and some kind of numbness in my hands.
Hopefully these symptoms improve in the coming days as I had to lie down and began to type all this out to share.
Again my reasoning for doing all is very complex to me and hard to articulate, but the summary of it is that I needed to change and with all the current events going on that actually impact me because of my job, I decided that choice for myself.
I share this to offer insight to anyone and wanted to provide my experience so far coming off this.
Heed the warnings you read about going Cold Turkey on this medicine or others like it.

Hi, this is my pitch for The Sims 4 to have an Afrocentric world.

The main theme: SAFARI.

We would get inspired from countries such as Tanzania, Kenya and Zanzibar for the safari part and Ivory Coast/South Africa for night life. It would be a GP format (just like Tartosa, Batuu and stuff) but we could have a whole EP. It would have the following:

* Zoo
* Safari (to be interactive like the Jungle in Selvadora)
* Coffee shop
* One nightclub
* Flea market
* Utulivu Inn
* A Retreat

New jobs to be introduced:

Full time:

* Zoologist
* Hunter (For villains)
* New artifacts for Archeologists
* Doctors Without Borders
* Wildlife protector

Part time:

* Safari guide
* Food picker
* Zoo worker
* Maid (becomes a job)

New traits (Hunter, child of the savana, lion-hearted), new foods (fufu, jollof, egusi) , new cause of death (stomped by an elephant, eaten by a tiger, fever from mosquito (can be healed by a Sangoma, village healer)), new hobbies (Voodoo, tribal dancing, motorbiking, mountain biking, sight seeing). We could have a radio station with Afro beat. It goes without saying that we would incorporate a mix of traditional outfits for locals and better ‚Äúadventure‚Äù clothes than for Selvedora.

We would be introduced to running an Inn/Lodge. Very similar to owning an Apartment but only vacation stays. All the revenues would go to the player‚Äôs character. If the Inn gets bad reviews it will show in the sims news, and playable character will feel embarrassed, otherwise he will gain notoriety. The Lodge, unlike the appartements will need to be cleaned daily, hence why maid being a job is now possible. Depending on the type of Lodge, fresh food must be served. The rating on the food increase with the cooking skill of our character or (just like restaurants) ability to manage the Inn‚Äôs employees.

We would have new townies, family Osefo with Koffie and Ayo, they are brothers and sisters and inherited the Inn from their parents. Koffie is a young adult entrepreneur trait would be clumsy, ambitious and neat. He is in charge of the Inn with the help of his younger sister. Ayo, is the youngest sister of Koffie, her traits are outgoing, lion-hearted and loves outdoors. She‚Äôs a part time Safari guide and helps her brother maintaining the Inn. They are both single and live/work at the Inn in the concierge room.

The other pair of townies would be a couple of retired elders, they live in the nicest neighbourhood of the city. The van Rensburgs, Willem and Behati. Willem is a Villain, he has the traits of materialistic, hunter and mean. He likes to hunt and wants to have the biggest collection of Rhino horns to resell to the black market. He is married to Behati who aspires to be one with nature. She has the trait child of the savana, active and foodie. She loves going to retreats and enjoy the nature of the savana. She is not fan of Willems hobby which make their relation awkward.

I came here because I need to get this out of my chest.   
And sorry in advance about grammar mistakes, english is a second language for me.

Yesterday, out of the bloom, my fiance√© broke up with me.   
Just send me a text, and I quote: "" I love you, but I can¬¥t take this anymore. We¬¥re done.""No explanation, no anything.   
I was kicked out of the house with a text from the person I was going to spend the rest of my life with.

Now, by all means, I'm not perfect.   
We argued sometimes, we both made mistakes. I'm no saint and I won't pretend to be.

But we loved eachother, and did everything for eachother.  
She was my entire life, and I thought I was hers. 

And now, my world is completly shattered.   
I gave up everything for that woman. 

I had good paying job that worked hard for, and gave it up because we'd spend weeks and sometimes months apart, due to being far away.   
I never had anyone to tie me up to my home, so I ventured into the world and fought for a better life, until she came along. 

And she didn't forced me, but the distance was tearing us apart and we wanted to be together. 

Now, we lived together since I moved back, a littler over a year and a half ago.   
And she was wanted to own her own business, a coffee shop.  
I hated the idea, because it means long hours, a lot of work and sacrifice from her part. 

But I supported her, and even went to work for her, without any salary, so she could get off her feet.   
I'd do anything for the love of my life, which she was. Is, although it hurts to even say. 

Now, I'm only saying this because this has been going on for the past 6 months, and now, I was left with nothing.   
I don't have a cent to my name, I don't have any prospects, and worse, I lost the only woman I've ever loved in my 30 years of existence.  
I gave up my entire life for her. MY friends, my job, my prospects, my dreams.   
And she never asked me. I'd do it all over again. I'd move the world for her. 

I came to my parents house yesterday and my mom cried almost as much as I did.   
She loved her, all my family did. 

I feel defetead, ashamed. Honestly? I feel like this is it. 

I was driving home yesterday, late at night, and I just thought ""What if I swerve off the road? It would just end. It would all be over so quickly"".  
And I'm scared.  
Guys, I'm really scared. 

I just cry, I didn't even thought it would be possible to cry this much and when I'm not thinking about how much I miss her, how happy I was with her, I think about how I could end this.

Sorry, I have no one else to talk to.   
I'm just broken.",2,1739321071.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False
1ineequ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Truckers/comments/1ineequ/fuel_pump_argument/,Fuel pump argument,I may have taken a fuel pump argument a bit to far.  So I was having issues with my fuel card so it took me about 10 mins to start getting fuel. I had to go inside and after a few tries it finally worked. When I came back out there was a guy walking around my tractor taking a video of it. This pissed me off so I decided to be petty and take my sweet time getting fuel and getting stuff from the store. When I came back out and about to leave the guy starts coming to take video again so I flicked him off and started driving off. I was gonna leave it there but he decided to follow me and start yelling so I stopped and started yelling back at one point he pissed me off so I threw coffee in his face and yelled a few more things and left. I know I was petty but I hate when people are assholes for no reason. Dude obviously wasn't in to big of a hurry if he wanted to get in argument with me. ,1,1739321025.0,Truckers,25,0.52,False
