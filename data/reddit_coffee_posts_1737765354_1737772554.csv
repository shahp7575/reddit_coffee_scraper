Chapter 1: The Creation of the Brew

1. In the beginning, there was darkness over the waters of the kettle, and James Hoffman spoke: ""Let there be grind,"" and there was grind. And the grind was fine, yet not too fine, lest bitterness would rise.


2. And James saw that the grind was good, and he separated the grounds from the chaff with the great Ritual of WDT, for the grounds must be distributed evenly, that the shot might flow true.


3. And he spoke again: ""Let there be tamping, firm but gentle, that the puck may stand strong against the waters."" Thus the tamper was brought forth, and the grounds were pressed with care.


4. On the second day, James declared: ""Let the waters flow at nine bars of pressure, no more and no less, that the elixir of life might descend."" And lo, the water met the grounds, and there was extraction.


5. And the espresso flowed golden and thick, a stream of crema glistening with promise. And James called it ""God Shot,"" and it was good.


---

Chapter 2: The Rituals of the Faithful

1. Blessed are those who observe the 1:2 ratio, for they shall inherit balance. For every gram of coffee, let there flow two grams of espresso, no more and no less, lest the brew fall into sourness or bitterness.


2. And the prophet Matt Perger taught: ""Grind finer, grind finer still, until the extraction sings. But beware, for too fine a grind brings choking, and your machine shall groan under the weight of your hubris.""


3. On the third day, it was commanded: ""Clean thy portafilter and purge thy steam wand, for cleanliness is next to godliness, and stale grounds bring ruin to thy brew.""


4. And the faithful gathered their tools: the scale, the grinder, and the puck screen. They worked with reverence, for the craft was sacred, and the taste was their offering.


---

Chapter 3: The Trials of the Uninitiated

1. Woe unto the one who tampeth unevenly, for their puck shall crack, and channeling shall plague their shot.


2. And the unfaithful shall say, ""It is too much work,"" but the wise will reply, ""Patience, for the way of espresso is narrow and requires discipline. Seek perfection, and thou shalt be rewarded.""


3. Beware the false prophets who cry, ""Pods are enough,"" for they have forsaken the true craft. Their brew is but a shadow of the divine nectar.


---

Chapter 4: The Kingdom of Crema

1. On the seventh day, the barista rested, for the espresso was made perfect. The crema was thick, the body full, and the finish sweet like the morning dew.


2. And the faithful gathered around their cups and praised the work of their hands. They shared stories of their struggles with dialing in, yet rejoiced in the triumph of a balanced shot.


3. And James said unto them, ""Go forth and share the gospel of espresso. Teach the world the way of grind, tamp, and ratio. And may your baskets always be full, your pressure stable, and your crema unbroken.""


4. For thine is the grinder, and the scale, and the machine, forever and ever. Amen.",1,1737772476.0,espressocirclejerk,0,1.0,False

1i9cx4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1i9cx4f/is_my_wife_cheating/,Is my wife cheating?,"My wife has cheated on me in the past most notably with a former colleague at place we used to work. This was really early on and after brief break up we worked it out and eventually married. 

Recently she came home one afternoon from working at local cafe (and when I say ‘working’ I mean her remote job for sales tech company not actually working as a coffee shop employee)flustered telling me a guy that is a server there and looks at her a lot asked her for her number and she panicked and gave it to him. 

She said she just froze and gave it.
I asked if she was attracted to him she said yes but that didn’t have anything to do with it. She was caught off guard and panicked. 

She said she wasn't interested and would not respond to him and we had a laugh (though my initial reaction was why not just say you have a husband?). She showed me text that came in (him saying hey it’s me from coffee shop) and never responded. 

However every work day since for last month she's been at that cafe from 10am-5pm; she took me off her Lock Screen on phone, l've even noticed once her without her ring.

She recently asked me about threesomes with other men but when I ask if it's the guy from coffee shop she says no just wants to in general. I said maybe I could consider it on an exotic vacation but certainly not someone local. She said she’d want to be able to do it with someone she has rapport with. 

She called me crying the other night (it’s been a month since the first phone number encounter) while I was on work trip saying she just feels bad that the phone number thing happened and can tell I'm Trying to over compensate for it by being extra nice an accommodating like I’m competing. She feels bad and doesn’t want me to feel that way. Loves me; I’m so great. Etc. (totally unsolicited I was working).

I told her why don't you just avoid that coffee shop then; it’s clearly giving us issues and causing problems. Even if it’s totally on up and up - why not just remove yourself from situation all together. Please for me! 

She got a bit defensive at first saying I’m being controlling and nothing is going on but ultimately after some back and forth said okay, you’re right I’ll stop going. 

Turns out the rest of the week including today (when I’m back home) she's been at the coffee shop.

I keep pleading to stop going to coffee shop just so I can feel stable and secure, but she keeps telling me I’m crazy and insane and nothing is going on and I’m being controlling. She even called her mom and had her mom defend her (but by end even her mom said - you know if he really feels this way you should stop going he’s your husband). 

We’re now not really speaking as we’re both mad at eachother.

 ### **Loki's Message**
Loki’s playful yet cunning nature often guides us through chaos to clarity. His message might be urging you to stop overextending yourself (2 of Pentacles) and to face your emotions without letting them dominate your decisions (reversed Queen of Swords). He wants you to prepare for a new path where your intellect, honesty, and decisiveness will serve as your strongest tools (Ace of Swords).  

Loki could also be nudging you toward embracing change and challenging old ways of thinking—reminding you to trust your ability to adapt and thrive.

1i9cvko,https://i.redd.it/72n5xlnjw1fe1.png,Intermittent Fasting Dilemma,"Question about fasting.

First for some background. I've been on the carnivore diet for about four and a half months. I eat mostly beef, but all kinds of meat as well as dairy (but I try not to overdo the dairy). I rarely eat fish because I don't like it. I take magnesium fish oil and iodine as supplements, but that's it. 

So I've always been under the impression that intermittent fasting is healthy. I've been doing it for about a year, a year and a half, to help maintain my weight loss (more on that later). I skip breakfast and don't eat my first meal until about noon or so. Before starting carnivore, I would sometimes snack in addition to those two meals. I had a lot of coffee drinks with artificial sweeteners and or creamer and them. I lost about 90 lb (on Weight Watchers) and after maintaining  it for about 2 years, I gained about 30 back.  My food was starting to get out of control again and it scares me. I couldn't say no to sugar. Along with the “healthy” meat and vegetables, I ate a lot of processed “healthier” options, but really junk food. I started carnivore mainly to break my sugar addiction but I was hoping to lose the 30 lb that I had gained and maybe another 5 or 10. (I lost maybe 14lbs and then hit a plateau after about 2 months in.) I also was in a lot of pain prior to starting carnivore (which is now much better) and have a thyroid nodule that I'm hoping to shrink.

So, now for my question. Like I said, I always thought intermittent fasting was healthy so I've continued on with that throughout my carnivore journey, and I was hoping to eventually get down to OMED. My question has to do with hunger. I know with carnivore you're supposed to eat when you're hungry, till satisfied. When I get up in the morning, oftentimes I'm hungry, but I don't eat, trying to stick with the intermittent fasting plan. So I wait till noon or so. I'm definitely hungry again by dinner time and occasionally hungry before bed and I might have a snack of a couple hard boiled eggs, butter, or some yogurt with pork rinds or something like that. So because of my hunger, I have not been able to do OMED like I'd hoped. I'm wondering if I should just go ahead and eat three meals a day and stop trying to do intermittent fasting. Occasionally, instead of intermittent fasting I will have a carnivore coffee as I call it, which is decaf coffee, collagen peptides, cream, and butter, and sometimes MCT oil. (Yes I know that's not carnivore.)

I'd be happy to know your thoughts and opinions on this fasting dilemma, especially if you can back it up scientifically with real facts and tell me why you believe what you believe (or point me in the right direction with a link). Also, if anybody has any specific opinions about MCT oil, why I shouldn't eat it (not just the fact that it isn't carnivore) I like to hear that too.   Thank you so much for your time and patience.

1i9cv9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1i9cv9b/intrusive_thoughts_gone_officially_60_days/,Intrusive thoughts gone! Officially 60 days without coffee,"Hello Reddit,

I’m officially 60 days no coffee. Holy shit.

Background on me: I’ve been drinking pop/soda since I was really young—like 5 years old. My parents didn’t think much of it, probably because they grew up drinking it too. By middle school, I was already hooked on iced coffee. In high school, it got worse. I remember one time I drank an entire gallon of mocha-flavored coffee in a day. I barely slept that night—probably 4 hours tops—and spent the whole night playing video games until 5 a.m. The next day? Fell asleep in class, like always.

Looking back, I don’t really blame my parents. They didn’t know any better, and honestly, I didn’t either. But now that I’m 24, I just couldn’t keep living like that. Something had to change. I was having constant panic attacks. Could not sleep. 

Quitting coffee wasn’t easy. At first, I felt like absolute garbage. Headaches, fatigue, irritability—you name it. I thought I was dying. But now, 60 days in, I feel so much better. My anxiety has gone way down. I don’t have those constant fear-based thoughts anymore, and I’m finally sleeping like a normal person.

That said, it’s still hard sometimes. Going out to eat or figuring out what to drink in the morning is a challenge. Water feels boring, and I miss having something flavorful. I’ve been trying out herbal teas and the occasional decaf drink, but it’s not the same.

Ultimately, I feel like my mental health is more important to me at the end of the day. Caffeine should not be consumed every day. It is a stimulate. A drug. It’s not normal or natural to consume heaps of it daily. You are abusing your body and your brain by doing this. It’s not worth it just a drink. You control yourself, not what you consume. It’s never the other way around, and if you’re doing something that makes you feel dependent on it to feel fulfilled, that’s when you know something is wrong. ",5,1737772035.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

These compact devices are designed to perform specific tasks, making cooking and meal preparation quicker and easier. From blending smoothies to toasting bread, small home appliances are essential for every culinary enthusiast.

One of the most popular small home appliances in the kitchen is the blender.

Another indispensable appliance is the toaster, which can transform your breakfast routine by delivering perfectly browned slices of bread, bagels, or pastries with minimal effort.

In addition to these essentials, coffee makers have become a staple for many households, enabling users to brew their favorite coffee blends with ease. Moreover, air fryers have gained immense popularity for their ability to create crispy fried foods with less oil, making them a healthier alternative to traditional frying methods.

It was really painful to read everything since it reminded me of my FAness and how easy other people have it, but it had to be done. I've tried so many things but still no gf irl so that's why I needed to find more ways. 

**Places/ways:**

Most advice are trash but these are *slightly more* doable than others, with a *slightly better* people/effort ratio or quality/effort ratio. Some of these are quite unusual but I'm putting them here anyways in case all methods fail. 

- Beauty expo
- Library activities
- Art gallery
- Community events
- Group therapy
- Cold approach 300 in 30 days and treat it like your life depends on it 
- Side job
- Connect with prison immates 
- Ask barista for referral 

**Advice that I've discounted:**

These are just generic locations, places with low people/effort ratio, or places I'm not interested in but you may find useful. 

- Book stores
- Bars and clubs
- Classes like painting, cooking, dancing
- Church (funny how so many people became theists suddenly when giving advice)
- Volunteering
- Grocery store
- Coffee shop
- Gym 
- Sports 
- etc.
-  And of course the usual BS love yourself and stop looking you'll meet someone advice 

**FYI, things I've tried personally:**

- Meetups
- Hobby groups and events
- Creating & advertising my own meetup
- Bars and clubs 
- Language exchanges
- Language learning platforms
- Online chat platforms
- Travelling to another city 
- Dating apps
- Asking friends
- Asking a researcher 
- Cold approaches

**Things I might try in the future:**

Other than the advice from those comments,

- Anime/cosplay expo 
- Speed dating

Coffee shops are the go-to third place in US cities, but they're no use for someone trying to cut down on coffee. Most don't offer many vegan-friendly drinks coffee. You don't go for a cafe for their tea options. I could opt for decaf but I think that's a slippery slope that would just make my crave normal coffee.

What are some good options similar to a coffee shop but without the coffee? Places where I can chit-chat, maybe see a show or go to events, sit down, etc. Museums and libraries aren't social enough. Tea shops are uncommon.",1,1737771296.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I've been working at this shop for a couple months now and I've noticed a lot of nasty/sketch shit. the biggest thing so far has been the mold in the pastry case. there's a part of our pastry case that's under a metal piece (the customers can't see it and employees can only see it if they lift the metal piece) that is completely filled with mold. all the crumbs from the pastries fall in there and it's clear it hasn't been cleaned in a long time. I was cleaning out the pastry case one day (this isn't done regularly, I'm the only one that's done it since I've started working here, I make sure to clean it out every time I work now). I told my manager about the mold the next day and he just said ""yeah..."" ?? as if he already knew it was in there??? and doesn't care about it ?? well that was 2 months ago and I just checked and the mold is still there. so clearly he doesn't care about it.

multiple employees resteam milk, don't rinse milk pitchers after each use, don't wipe or purge the steam wands, let coffee grounds get into the ice bin, grab pastries with their BARE HANDS instead of using the tongs and hand it to the customer, I've found multiple milk cartons that have mold/are chunky/out of date, they don't wash dishes properly (I've watched one person literally just rinse a blender with water and then put it on the clean rack to dry, no soap no sanitizer), I've seen multiple employees handle food with their bare hands when making the sandwiches (one of which was my manager), I called out another employee for not washing her hands after she used the bathroom. she literally was about to go right back to making drinks after using the bathroom and then got pissed when i told her that's disgusting. I just noticed tonight that there's mold in the bottom of one of the trash cans, like the entire bottom of it is covered in mold from someone's drink spilling on it. our ac/heat also don't work well so it's gotten well into the 80s inside and nothing has been done about it, I'm sure that amount of heat and humidity is great for the food we're serving :/

me and another coworker are the only ones who actually clean anything but it's kinda useless cause it all gets disgusting again when we're off.

it's a shit show and I don't think the owners are gonna do anything about it if I just talk to them so I've decided to report it to the health department. I've been wanting to report it for a while but I'm worried about jeopardizing mine and my coworkers jobs.",3,1737771289.0,barista,2,1.0,False

One of them even pretends to be a Mormon..","A little over a year ago, two new girls, Ana (28) and Lucrecia (24), started working at my company. At first, they were cordial, but soon they began to abuse the work schedule. Instead of taking the 15-minute break for breakfast, they would take between 30 and 60 minutes just to order Uber Eats, and then spend another hour eating. During lunch, instead of resting for one hour, they would take two: one for eating and another for sleeping in the office.

When they complained to the director about their workload, they started assigning me the tasks they weren’t doing. The situation worsened when our director went on maternity leave, and Ana and Lucrecia, with more freedom, began leaving to smoke up to 3 times a day and would go to the local coffee shop every day.

Later, they hired new girls, and Ana and Lucrecia quickly passed along ""tips"" like: ""If you get on the boss's good side, he’ll forgive everything."" They constantly took advantage of the situation, bringing him liquor, making impossible bets (where there was no way the boss could lose), sharing weed, etc. They did the same with the new girls to keep them quiet. They invited them to pools, restaurants, parties, and supplied them with drugs, all while criticizing them behind their backs. I’m not into partying or that kind of thing, so we didn’t have major issues until one afternoon when the office dog threw up. Upon seeing it, they walked over and said, ""Oh no, don’t follow your aunt my name's bad example."" That’s when I found out they had started spreading the rumor that I was slim because I vomit, which is completely false, as I just have a slim genetic build.

The situation worsened when Ana and Lucrecia started taking more time off: Ana went abroad for a month, and Lucrecia had two vacations with only a week’s gap between them. Meanwhile, I barely got one week off per year. The worst part came when they promoted Lucrecia. She started promising impossible deadlines to the boss, and when she couldn’t meet them, she would blame the rest of us.

Recently, Lucrecia left moldy dishes in the kitchen, and when I mentioned it, she not only ignored my comment but also got upset, started rejecting my  work assignments, which now have to go through her to get approved , and assigned me extra tasks
To show you the type of people they are, Lucrecia constantly brags about how her family pretended to be Mormon for a few years so her father could obtain larger and better-paid architectural projects, positions that are only given to members of the Mormon community. This taught her that she must always get the best, no matter how. I don't subscribe To the Mormon beliefs, but using it to manipulate their community and gain monetary gain is abhorrent to me""

When the consequences finally arrived, they affected the rest of us more. A clear example of this was the Christmas before last: we were allowed to work remotely, and they took every day of home office as if it were a day off. Consequently, when we came back to the office, nothing had been done. This was one of the few times when the boss was actually displeased with them, but instead of punishing them, we all took the fall. Last Christmas they didn't allow ANY of us to work remotely.

Maybe one way to put things into perspective (and have a little petty revenge) would be to contact the Mormon community and tell them how her family used this “strategy” to take advantage of their resources, showing that one cannot take advantage of others without consequences.",0,1737771015.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.33,False

Two months ago my best friend was snapping a friend of hers while we were out getting lunch and this friend (let's call her ava) said I was handsome and that she would like to know if I was single at the time I was but had just gotten out of a bad situation with a guy I'd been hooking up with and just wasn't ready for anything yet. She told me that was fine and I didn't hear anything about her for about a month.

She had texted my our mutual friend and asked for my number as she was wondering if I wanted to get coffee sometime as friends. Our mutual friend told me this and so I sent her my number and she text me later that night. We arranged to meet at a local cafe the next day and get some lunch, I expected to not really feel anything for her as I was still upset about what happened with that guy and wasn't really ready for anything 

We met at 11 am and had a coffee, followed by a walk around the city while we chatted about our lives and what we wanna do, we then went back to my place and I made dinner at 5pm, we drank some wine and watched shitty movies on netflix before she asked if she could stay the night, which i was fine with bcos i was instantly smitten. From the second we started talking everything clicked it was like she had been hand made by the Gods and sent in my direction

Everything from the fact we listened to the same music, enjoyed the same food, wore the same brands everything was just perfect and we laughed the whole time. I woke up early the next morning and cooked some eggs before she got up ate and kissed me goodbye while thanking me for the night before, we scheduled another date two days later and again it was perfect. We went on dates twice a week for about two weeks and I thought she was my soul mate. 

But last week I woke up and text her like I would normally and found that I was blocked, not only on Snapchat Instagram and tiktok. But my number too. I instantly panicked and text our mutual friend asking if ava had said anything to her about me and she said that the night before the two of them got into an argument bcos our mutual friend believed I was being used as a way for ava to get over her ex boyfriend who had dumped her (for unrelated reasons) after she asked for my number the first time. 

And since then I have felt numb and not in the 2016 me Linkin park way. But just kinda empty.

It's just shitty and the fact I can't even talk to her anymore and ask her what actually happened is just worse, since then I have not talked to my friend about it cos I don't know how to feel about her now, like yes I appreciate the fact she stood up for me and all but on the other hand she could've just talked to me first and then let me handle everything 

It's shitty and I feel like an idiot now 

Thanks for listening to me and I'm sorry for any spelling/weird layout things I'm on mobile for the first time In forever",1,1737769991.0,bisexual,0,1.0,False

*Think about Alice. Keep driving. Eyes on the road.* 

*The hitchhikers will step out eventually. They always do.* 

*Just don’t look back at them. Don’t ever look back.*

*Don’t think, just drive.* 

—-----------------------------------

I have a lot of love for my parents, having the generosity to take Alice and me in after her leukemia relapsed, but goddamn do they live far from civilization. Or maybe there just ain’t a lot of civilization in Idaho to go around - not in a bad way; the quiet is nice. I’ve been enjoying the countryside more than I anticipated. That being said, they could stand to spend some taxpayer dollars on a few more Walgreens locations. 

Feels like I’ve been driving all night; must almost be morning. They have to be worried sick. Alice may actually be physically sick without her antinausea meds.

I shook my head side to side in a mix of disbelief and self-flagellating shame. Took a left turn when I should have taken a right - a downright boneheaded mistake. The price for overworking myself, but I mean, what other option do I have? Chemotherapy ain’t exactly cheap. 

For a moment, I forgot where I was and what I was doing. Accidentally looked in my rearview mirror at the five hitchhikers in the backseats. Silent and staring forward with dead and empty eyes at nothing in particular.

Furiously, my eyes snapped forward, not wanting to linger too long on them - wasn’t sure what else I’d see. 

Can’t be doing that on this road. Maintaining focus is key. 

—-----------------------------------

Despite my near-instantaneous reaction, I did see the new hitchhikers, but only for a moment. No surprises this time, thankfully. They wore suits like all the others, monocolored with earthy tones from head to toe. Same odd fabric, too - rough and coarse-looking, almost like leather. Honestly, never seen anything like it before tonight. 

But I haven’t ever been in a situation like this before, either. Whatever backwoods county I got myself turned around in, it likes to follow its own rules. 

For example, I didn’t pull over to pick up these hitchhikers. Somehow, they just found their way in. Or maybe I did pull over and let them in? Been so tired lately; who could even be sure. They don’t say much, no matter how many questions I ask. Would love to know where I am, but I guess it isn’t for them to say.

My gaze again drifted, this time from the road to the car’s dashboard, and I let myself see the time. Big mistake.

7:59PM.

Nope, that ain’t right. I rapidly blinked a few times, adjusted myself so I was sitting up straighter, and then looked back to the clock again.

Now, it didn’t show any time at all. 

*Marty, Jesus. Focus up.* 

I blinked once more, this time for longer. Not sure how long I was blinking, couldn’t have been longer than ten seconds.

If I close my eyes for too long, they become hard to open again. Requires a lot of energy. Anxiously, I peered back at the dashboard for a third time.

4:45AM. 

See, there we go. Now *that* makes sense. By the time dawn arrives, I’m sure I will have found a gas station to pull over in. Ask for directions back to…whatever my parent’s address is. I’ll figure that out later, right now I need to focus. 

—-----------------------------------

Funny things happened in this part of the country when you didn’t focus. Sometimes, the yellow pavement markings would change colors, or disappear entirely. Other times, the road itself would start to look off - black asphalt turning to muddy brownstone at a moment’s notice. 

At first, it scared me. Scared me a lot, come to think of it. Made me want to pull over and close my eyes.

But Alice needed her nausea meds, and judging by the time, I had work in two short hours. I needed to make it home soon so I can check on her, give her a kiss before school. Hopefully, I’ll have time to brew a pot of coffee, too. 

My eyes, though - they just don’t seem to want to stick with the program. Dancing around from thing to thing like they don’t have a care in the world.

They have one job: watch the road for places that might have a map or someone who can tell me where I am. Well, two jobs. Watch the road *and* focus on the road. 

At least it wasn’t treacherous. The path has been pretty much straight after the wrong turn. 

—-----------------------------------

Initially, Alice was nervous about starting at her new school. And I get it - that transition is hard enough without factoring in everything she has had to manage in her short life. We’d been lucky though, finding a well-reviewed sign language school - in Idaho, of all places.  

She’s amazing - you’d think that the leukemia and the deafness from her first go with chemotherapy would have crushed her spirit. Not my Alice. She’s tough as nails. Tough as nails like her dad. 

I smiled, basking in a moment of fatherly pride. Of course, you can’t be doing that on this road. You’ll start to see things you don’t want to see. 

When my eyes again met the rearview mirror, I noticed there was now only one hitchhiker now, but he had transformed and revealed his real shape.

His face was flat like a manhole cover, almost the size of a manhole cover, too, but less circular - more oblong. He was staring at me with one bulging eye. It was the only one he had, the only one I could see at least. No other recognizable facial features. Just the one, bloated, soulless eye. 

What’s worse, I saw what was behind him. Behind the car, I mean. 

I closed my eyes as soon as I could, but my mind was already rapidly reviewing and trying to reconcile what I had seen behind the car. There was a wall a few car lengths away. No road to be seen, just an inclined wall with tire tracks on it. The atmosphere behind me had a weird thickness to it. Lightrays shone through the thickness unnaturally from someplace above. The ground looked like dust, or maybe sand, why would the ground look like -  

*FOCUS. Think of Alice, and focus*

When I finally found the courage to open my eyes, it all looked right again, and I breathed a sigh of relief and chuckled to myself from behind the wheel. Straight road in front of me, framed by a starless black sky. Everything in its right place. Until I saw something snaking its way into my peripheral vision. 

The hitchhiker was now in the passenger’s seat.

He turned to me and leaned his body forward over the stickshift; his lips were pursed and nearly pressing against my ears, rhythmically opening and closing his mouth but making no sound. I could have sworn he was close enough to touch my ear with his lips, but I guess he wasn't because I couldn’t feel it. Instead, I felt my heartbeat start to race, or I imagined what it was like to feel your heartbeat race. 

Why did I have to imagine...?

*Don’t turn. Don’t look. Don’t think. Just focus.* 

But I couldn’t. Something was wrong. I thought about closing my eyes. For a while, not just for a little. To see what would happen. I was curious what would happen. Had been all night, actually.

But then, like the angel she was, Alice’s visage appeared on the horizon. She was standing at her second-story window in my parent’s home, watching and waiting for me to return from this long night. I wasn’t getting closer for some reason, but she wasn’t getting any further away either. 

She was far, but even at that distance, I could see her doing something in the window. When I squinted, it looked like maybe she was waving.

Alice was waving at me. Alice could see me.

Must mean I'm close.

*Eyes on the road. Focus*

—-----------------------------------

Every night around 8PM, Alice would stand and watch the road from her bedroom on the second story of her grandparents' home. What she was waiting for didn’t happen as often anymore, but her birthday was a week away - the phenomenon seemed to be more frequent around her birthday. As the clock ticked into 8:03PM, she saw a familiar sight - two faint luminescent orbs traveled slowly down the deserted road in her direction, creating even fainter cylinders of light in front of them. 

Like headlights from an approaching car.

The first time this happened, Alice was nine. To cope with her father's disappearance, she would watch the road at night and pretend she saw his car returning home. One night, she saw balls of light appear in the distance, and it made hope explode through her body like fireworks. 

The balls of light turned into the driveway. And when they did, Alice noticed something that made hope mutate into fear and confusion.

The headlights had no car attached, dissolving without a trace within seconds of their arrival.

For months, this was a nightly occurrence, and only she could see it, which scared Alice. But when she formally explained the phenomenon to her grandfather for the first time, how they looked like headlights without a car, a weak and bittersweet grin appeared on his face, and he carefully brought up his hands to sign to her:

*I’d bet good money that’s Marty making his way home, sweetheart. He just loved you that much.*

From then on, the orbs comforted Alice and made her feel deeply connected with her long-lost father, wherever he was. But in the present, at the age of nearly seventeen, she had modified the purpose of her vigil.

Originally, she liked the idea of her father’s endless search for her. It made her feel less alone. But as she lived life and matured, she realized how alone he must be looking for her from where he was. All she wanted was for Marty to stop looking. She wanted her father to finally rest. 

Now, when the orbs passed by, she would sign to them from her window, desperately hopeful that even from where he was he could see her hands move, communicating an important message to him:

we decided to make it a split party with a FEW drinks involved amongst adults, but still family-friendly with kids games and the younger ones involved. my niece of course had a few friends over, and we had a bunch of even younger kids from the family there.

anyways, my BIL showed up clearly a little buzzed already, and was guzzling down strong 8% beers; i think he drank a 6pack within 2 hours.

when he finished it he pulled out a 40 and went into the kitchen to start taking shots. he was stumbling around a bit when i checked on him, but when he noticed me he seemed to be fine, i figured i caught him in a bad moment.

we went back out to the others who were just starting to migrate from the backyard to the living room. 

as all the children and a few parents were scurrying back in he thought it would be hilarious to whip down his pants, helicopter-spin his genitals and throw his solo-cup full of whiskey at an 8 year old girl.

he then proceeded to call all of the children rounding up into the room ‘wastes of good beer-money’ before tripping on account of his pants being around his ankles. then falling into and completely destroying an $1800 glass coffee table and killing our 7 month old golden retriever violently via broken neck (accidentally due to the fall)

i very aggressively told him to leave, which he hesitantly did (not before calling me and my mother many slurs, however), and we havent heard from him since.

my wife however thinks i was a complete jerk and is talking about needing space/taking time apart. she says i had it out for her brother and was looking for a reason to pounce.

I love how it seems to have taken the best of every farming/cozy game and put it into one. Ever since I repaired the bridge and got the market started back up I had an idea I wanted to share with the void. 

Now, I won't lie, this idea is largely if not completely fueled by my desire to romance the coffee girl.

My idea was that they add an abandoned building in town and opened up romancing any of the Saturday merchants. Of course romancing any of them would be quite difficult since you only see them on Saturdays. However once you mange to romance one and they (I assume) move in with you it comes up that they still have a business to run and must go travelling to stay afloat. This could go on for a few weeks maybe where you only see them on Saturday until one Saturday they come to you by saying they bought the abandoned building and are setting up shop there to stop travelling. Could even expand on that and you have to buy them the building or you can buy/place items in it to design the store for them.

  
I felt like this would set up for a number of interesting custom story arcs such as coffee girl and the bar starting off with a fierce rivalry because people started going there for breakfast and a new hangout spot only for it to turn into a mutual agreement that the bar closes in the mornings and she closes at night.

Eating always felt like a chore and I could hardly enjoy the taste of food. Unsurprisingly, I've been quite undernourished and foolishly, I wondered why I felt so weak and tired all of the time. Of course sleeping poorly was one reason among many, but at some point I had to acknowledge the elephant in the room.

And so, it's been about 48 hours since I've cut down from 4-5 cups to 2-3 and just as I predicted, my appetite is slowly returning and I can enjoy food again. I still get some headaches and lethargy but these aren't unbearable to me after a solid meal and plenty of water and exercise.

I've come to learn that that's my biggest motivation for quitting, not necessarily the mental clarity or better sleep (I at times doubt whether that's possible even without caffeine) but the sheer fact that I can more easily nourish myself without coffee. And that, in itself, opens so many more exciting doors for physical and mental flourishing I may be surprised after going through.

My husband and I decided to try for our first this Fall. I stopped the 3-month continuous pill in October after taking it 12+ years, and had a really normal for me 29 day cycle. I ovulated and tracked using test strips. I’ve been using both the Flo and Premom apps to log everything.

On December 19th, I took multiple pregnancy tests, including two digital ones, because I had one morning of extreme nausea and two mornings of the idea of my normal coffee sounding horrendous. All tests were positives. My husband and I were traveling for the holidays so we exchanged gifts on the 20th. My husband got to open a onesie and the digital test as a fun reveal. He was thrilled, I was thrilled. It was the happiest moment of my life, hands down.

Over the next few days I was so anxious because I started cramping, which I know is a pregnancy symptom but also a period symptom, and I was sure something was wrong. I took a test on the 23rd and it was negative. I took several more- all negative. That is the craziest I’ve ever felt. I felt like a liar. I felt like I fooled myself and got my husband excited for nothing. From all my reading, it was a chemical pregnancy. On Christmas Eve morning, I started the worst period of my life. We grieved, I had a solidly difficult couple of weeks, but we decided to try again next cycle.

I ovulated within this cycle but my LH was lower compared to the previous times according to Premom. I read papers that said low LH could happen following cp or mc but didn’t seem to have an impact on fertility. 

Well according to Flo, my period should’ve started this last Tuesday 1/21. It didn’t. Premom said my period should’ve started today. But my period hasn’t started and I have zero PMS symptoms that normally start showing up. Premom told me to take a pregnancy test starting yesterday. I took a test yesterday and it was negative. I took another today and negative. 

I’m just not sure what to do or think. I have a pre-scheduled appointment with my doctor next month but I don’t know what is worth sharing. I realize I’m only a couple months into this and that many people have dealt with years and years of this. I don’t mean to be alarmist or whiny. I’m just having a hard time with more questions than answers.

1i9bvrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyEx/comments/1i9bvrj/im_inlove_with_a_guy_i_hate/,Im inlove with a guy i hate,"Personal details and dates left out for privacy x

A few years back i got set up with a guy and we hit it off immediately. We had the same sense of humour, morals and political/religious stances. The mutual friend who had set us up didn’t actually intend to set me up with him, i was originally supposed to be set up with his friend. Back in the snapchat days this took place so dont judge to harshly 😅 but she had given us both shout outs and we had coincidentally asked about eachother without being direct. But eventually he added me and we spoke every night although it was just online as he was in a different state and i was at home. 


He came back to our state in june and after months of talking and through the night phone calls as he was 4 hours behind. He ghosted me for like a week and i was pissed but not to a high degree as i didnt have strong feelings for him a slight crush but i considered him more of a friend but i never made the effort to reach out until a month later he did and apologised profusely we spoke for around a a month Before he ghosted me again. 

From july to October we never sent a text or acknowledged eachother just silently viewing eachothers instagram stories as i had removed him from snapchat. In mid October he texted me again and i was still pissed but bored so i started talking to him for a solid 24 hours until i ghosted him. He seemed genuinely upset as he messaged a few times asking what he did and apologising.

 Towards the end of October i realised that I had genuinely missed his company and despite a lot of arguments from friends i messaged him, he was shocked but happy telling me he missed me, and always listened to songs that remind him of me or ones we sang together over the phone (something i did a lot aswell). We talked for 2 weeks and i realised how strong my feelings had developed and that he probably didn’t feel the same way, so after a lot of crying and considering i removed him once again. 

He would text again apologising, he texted on Christmas day and new years day both times i didnt respond. One day in at the end of January my sister asked about him and i broke down crying to her about how much i missed him and that i wished i hadn’t ruined it. 

That night for the first time in almost a month he sent me a tiktok and i replied. We talked about what has happened between us and that he didnt like not having me in his life, we played online games together and we were on the phone from 9pm-7am. That night i realised that i had fallen hard for a guy i had never met. He was in another state at this point but when he came back we became official. 

It was perfect i couldn’t have asked for a better first boyfriend when we were together. We had regular dates, we spent valentines day together to which he spoiled me. He took me to places i had always wanted to go. He had charmed my family, i had began to form a friendship with his sister and honestly i loved his younger siblings they were so sweet! We did everything together even after dropping me off home he would call me and we would debrief our day. He was everything to me, he was my first kiss, my first love and my first heartbreak. 

We were together for a few months and it was genuinely perfect, despite his actions i believe that for a while he did truly love me. The extents he went to showing me his love rather than saying it which he did regularly gives me no doubt that he loved and cared for me. One day it all came crashing down. He called me he was audibly upset on the verge of tears telling me he wishes our lives could be perfect together and he wished we had eloped on the very day he met me. I was worried but reassured him it was all going to work out between us, completely oblivious to what had happened. 

The next night he confessed everything. The previous weekend he had drunkingly cheated and the girl was a strict catholic and now wanted him to marry her because she thought she was pregnant. I was heartbroken and devastated. We argued for hours both begging eachother for everything and nothing at the same time. After both of us falling short of answers we both decided to end it. 

I was not coping well at all and a month later I messaged him hoping he was missing me, he was bitter and cold towards me, i asked why he hated me (in my depressed teenage mind this was the case) to which he answered “i dont hate you please dont think i hate you” those words stick with me every day. At that moment those words broke me in a million pieces because after all that i would have rather he hated me. All i could say was “okay, i dont hate you either” and so i removed him for the final time. A few months later i found out he was engaged to the girl, the photos i saw of them together he looked uncomfortable and bitter, something definitely unusual for him because for every facetime and photo we had together he always looked ecstatic. A few months after the engagement and an obvious faked pregnancy with photoshoped pregnancy scans they broke it off due to her cheating. 

This is all almost 2 years ago now and i think of him every single fucking day. I’ve moved on after a long time hurting, pinning and begging god to bring him back. I hate him for cheating and ruining what we had. I hate him for going out that weekend. I hate him for throwing everything away for a girl who did nothing but lie to his face. I hate him for for not hating me. 

The worst part is i dont even hate him infact i love him as much as i did from the get go. I thought we would spend our lives together as we had talked about it so much. I get we were young, made mistakes and probably could have resolved everything. I have always had a hard time trusting anyone but he broke down every barrier i had and i did the same for him. As i said i dont doubt his love for me, i think we were just young and fucked it up. Its been almost 2 years and i miss him so much. I’ve moved on and talked to other people and had my fun. 

But at the end of the day its always him, my everything. I got rid of all the gifts, most of the photos although i still think i have tickets from our first date. I pray for him and his family every night and wish him no harm. I still listen to songs that instantly remind me of him. I still wonder if he ever thinks of me when he hears our song or he has a particular starbucks coffee the way i do. I hope he does. If i could change it to where i never thought of him at all, honestly i dont think i would. He taught me so much, that i am a good person worth loving, how to love and to be proud of who i am. I owe so much to him and yet i deserve better. 

To anyone reading this, hold the one you love close, don’t gamble everything on a one night stand. And most importantly if you like someone and you dont know if they like you back, tell them because if not you will have so much wasted time that you will regret. ",1,1737768920.0,MyEx,0,1.0,False

Top Features to Look for in Quality Insulated Wine Tumblers for Outdoor Adventures
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you’re out exploring the great outdoors, enjoying a glass of your favorite wine can be a delightful experience. However, having the right equipment is key to ensuring your wine stays at the perfect temperature. Insulated wine tumblers are an excellent choice for those who love to sip while adventuring. But what exactly should you look for when choosing the perfect insulated wine tumbler? Let’s dive into the top features that make these tumblers a must-have for your outdoor escapades.

### Superior Insulation

The primary function of insulated wine tumblers is to keep your drink at the ideal temperature.

### Durable Material

When you’re in nature, durability matters. Tumblers made from high-quality stainless steel are built to withstand bumps and bruises. They should be resistant to rust and able to handle various weather conditions. This durability ensures that your tumbler lasts through all your outdoor adventures, keeping your wine safe and secure.

### Size and Capacity

Another important feature to consider is the size of the tumbler. Insulated wine tumblers typically range from 12 to 16 ounces. If you enjoy a hearty pour, a larger capacity may be more suitable. Keep in mind that a tumbler that fits comfortably in your hand and fits in your picnic bag is ideal for portability.

After a day of outdoor fun, the last thing you want is to deal with a complicated cleaning process. Choose insulated wine tumblers that are easy to clean and dishwasher safe. This feature makes it simple to get rid of any leftover wine or residue, allowing you to enjoy your next adventure without a hassle.

### Non-Slip Base

A tumbler that slips easily off your picnic table or car hood can lead to messes and lost wine. Look for features like a non-slip base or rubber ring at the bottom. This will help stabilize your tumbler and reduce the risk of spills while you’re enjoying a drink in rugged settings.

I've been sticking to a Mediterranean diet for the past year and lost 50 pounds on my own, but stagnated and haven't been able to mak
e further progress. For reference, I'm 51 and 10 years post-menopausal, which may have added to the challenge. 

Enter Zepbound. 

I injected my first shot last Sunday and noticed the impact by Monday morning - mostly just a disinterest in eating and an odd feeling in my gut. Not a bad feeling, just... different. I recognize that may change as time goes on and dosages potentially increase. I'm drinking lots of water and having a protein shake before my morning coffee to help avoid potential heartburn, etc. So far, so good. I'm sure the three pounds I lost this week are simply water weight. God knows I've been peeing like it's my singular purpose in life. 

Now for the questions. First, I'd prefer to change my shot day to Friday or Saturday; since I'm only one shot in, can I just take my second shot tonight (Friday) or tomorrow, even though it will have only been 5-6 days insread of 7? I believe the half-life of Zepbound is 5 days, so I assume this wouldn't cause an excess in my system, but I'd rather get your opinions since I'm a newbie! 

Second, besides shakes, what are your favorite protein sources? Based on consuming .7 to 1g of protein per pound of my goal weight (130-140) I think I should be getting 91-140g  daily, but struggle to reach 75. I don't consume much meat and hate eggs so most of my protein comes from shakes, beans, Greek yogurt and so on. I welcome any suggestions. Thank you!",1,1737767782.0,Zepbound,13,1.0,False

When he wants to ask my bf something, he asks me for him, because he sees me as the real man, he’s constantly rambling about dumb maga shit and staring at me like an eager puppy begging me to agree with him as a fellow sane cis moid that the woke nonsense has gone too far, but I just stare at him indifferently or say it’s stupid. When he misgenders my bf and I correct him he just pretends he doesn’t hear me, the cunt. He’s constantly screaming at his wife too when he gets home from work about dinner and dishes and cleaning. Add on top of that I’m a luckshit and he’s a salty cissoid manlet so I tower over him and mog him by at least 5 inches. 

His brother is an ultra maga repper manlet, almost 30 and still lives at home doing nothing with his life but talking shit about trannies on discord, doesn’t even shower, constantly talking shit about my bf but never to his face, glares at me but never says anything because I mog him by another 5 or 6 inches and constantly mean mug him so maybe he’s pussy. I’m confident I could easily beat the shit out of him despite his taunting to my boyfriend that cis men will always be physically superior to delicate delusional tranny “men”. 

I think he’s a repper because he briefly entertained the idea of transitioning after my bf came out but shut it down because he thought he’d be ugly. Me and my bf joke about putting estrogen in his coffee and maybe he’d calm tf down.

The photo shows my 3 hotel transactions on my statement during this stay for bar charge, coffee and the hotel cost, but as my title suggests I am still missing the 6x bonus points for the actual hotel stay charge on Nov 9. What’s weird is you can see they gave me the 6x bonus for the coffee and bar and not even the basic 2x points for the hotel stay if it somehow got mislabeled as non Marriott spend. 

I know this hotel just converted to a Marriott property in September 2024 so thought it could be their system. I called Amex around Christmas and the lady opened a case for me and said I’d get a response in 14 days. It’s now been another month and nothing, so I called back. This time the gentleman said the case is still open and he has no update and to give it a few more weeks. He agreed it’s weird that they gave me the 6x points for the $5 coffee and $17 bar charge but not the hotel stay. My bonvoy account has long been credited my base and elite point bonuses for the stay, so it’s just the Amex points missing. 

Earlier this month I stayed at a Towneplace suites and the 6x bonus is already showing on my Amex statement less then 3 weeks later so just confused how this card works now lol. At the end of the day it’s not a ton of points we’re talking about, but since I’m new to this card not sure how vigilant I’ll have to be about checking future hotel stays getting the proper points bonus.

Also, I'm translating the various sources I could find from my native language (italian) into english. So please be patient with me for the possible mistakes. Sorry, it's a long one!*

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We're in post war Italy. Our story begins with a ""nun"" named Suor Maria Diletta Pagliuca. Italy post war is not easy. Aside from the cities which have to be reconstructed, women have become widows, kids are born with disabilities (sight problems, hearing loss or even ""subnormal""). These kids' parents don't have the necessary means to properly take care of them and decide to leave them in institutes (mainly religious one, usually ran by nuns or priests, but mainly nuns).

Maria Diletta Pagliuca's first mention of her work happened in 1956; when a blind child named Maria Gaita recives a corneal transplant - the first to be performed in Italy. At the time, little Maria was hospitalized in Istituto Santa Rita \[Santa Rita's institute (I'm guessing she was living there but is possible she was simply hospitalized there and then left after the operation- unfortunately I'm not sure about this)\]; this institute was specialized in taking care of kids with mental and physical disabilities. Particularly, little Maria was staying in Santa Rita in Amalfi, which was ran by Maria Diletta.

Sister Maria Diletta, who was known as Suor Diletta (Suora means nun in Italian) or Suor Colomba, left her religious order and opened the Santa Rita institute in Amalfi, in the immediate postwar, in 1946. She also had been the youngest Head Nun (of the Francescan Elizabethan order) to manage an institute for the disabled in Assisi (I have no date for this fact but I think it was before 1946).

In 1951 she moved to another facility in Grottaferrata, to then move definitely in the Santa Rita Institute, in the same town of Grottaferrata. And this is where our story begins.

From sources of the time it is known that she received, from local authorities, between 2500 and 3000 liras per day\* which was considered very little for the basic needs of the kids in the institute care. She alledged that she was able to spend 300 italian liras per kid. Apparently, she also received donations from Canada and the US (but it is unknown if they were on a regular basis or if they happened sporadically). It was stated that she received, in total, 627000 liras in volountary bequest. 82000 liras was what she spent for taking care of 25 kids (which is very little).

***----------------------------------The Shocking Discovery------------------------------------------***

On June 8th, 1969 the horror committed in this institution came to light. Neither the orphanage nor Suor Colomba were what they appeared to be.

In fact, it was discovered that Suor Diletta did left the religious order for serious problems (though, it was not disclosed which problems they were). But in 1945 she was reported for ""abusive/unauthorized use of illegal clothing"" (I know this expression doesn't exist outside of Italy but that would be the most immediate translation) and was supposed to spend a time in prison but she actually never did.

She always managed to paint herself like a saint, who operated for charity and for taking care of the kids she hosted in the orphanage. It was the 1969 (unannounced) search that revealed who she really was. The kids were found in stinky and filthy rooms. On each bed there were two kids tied to the headboard. The hands were chained to it while their ankles were tied with cloth lace which caused serious circulation problems. Apparently, the children were wearing the bare minimum, some were wearing just underwear.

They were fed with just a bit of water and a piece of bread or a schlop with overcooked pasta (which the only intent was to look like it was more than it actually was). The kids didn't receive any type of medication nor psychological help. They were scolded, yelled at and blow struck with sticks for the only fact they wetted the bed or because they were crying because they were hungry. Mind you, these kids were abandoned since the birth or shortly after their birth. The water to drink was also rationed. The abuse they suffered lasted all these kids' lives. Another source I found report that some kids didn't make it out alive to Santa Rita, having died inside the institution, possibly because of the abuse. This source states that in the yard of the institute were found 4 bodies but the death count is as higher as 15 victims. Apparently, all the kids who lived there, were failed not only by the institution, but also by the doctors, members of the church and the municipality workers. It is also said that among the abuse towards these children there were also cold showers and blackmails. Suor Colomba was supposed to face a maximum of 20 years in prison of her crimes. She was finally sentencend to 8 years, 4 months in prison and a fine of 380 million of Italian Liras. She screamed that it was all a conspiracy and that the process was a faux one. In 1975 she tried to get pardoned by the Republic of Italy's president Giovanni Leone who refused.

Who can help shine a bit more light on this case is a former guest of the Horror Institute. Unfortunately, he was not only a victim, becoming involved in two deaths.

\---------------------------------------***The Scarred Victim***\-------------------------------------------

Giulio Collalto was born in 1953 in Rome. His mother abandoned him when he was three and he never even met his father. He spent his infancy until fourteen years old in the Grottaferrata institute. It is reported he was epileptic and mentally challenged from the start, while another source I consulted (which is a book that reports his case among others) affirms he became epileptic after the torture he endured. However he adds that during his stay at the orphanage the other kids and him suffered from blows with sticks, being chained and tied to a shared bed but also that they were forced to put their faces in their own excrements, or they were tied to a radiator. Giulio himself is said to have some marks of the blows on his arms and neck. As I said before it may also be the cause of his mental challenges and epilepsy.

After leaving the institute, Giulio was hospitalized in the Mombello psychiatric hospital in Limbiate^(1), near Milan (where he went in order to start his life from zero) from where he escaped. He was then admitted in another hospital (a normal, nonpsychiatric one) always trying to get cured, to have life in his own hands but it was obvious he would never recover mentally. He was found to be 2/3 incompetent and therefore he was granted a social/invalid pension. After escaping the last hospital he stayed in, he fell victim of a man who gave him a place to stay but forced him to have sexual relation with him.

Some sort of peace - albeit temporary- came from a 50years old man who found him hungry and dirty in a park. He decided to take him in and to take care of him. In him, Giulio found some sort of father figure. This man (whose name I can't find) understood that he needed to receive treatment and had him hospitalized in Limbiate (possibly, the same as before, ""Mombello"") where, after a short stay he was discharged being ""fully recoverd \[mentally\]"". That would be a fatal mistake. Meanwhile, the 50 year old man became so important for Giulio that he started calling him ""Lo Zio"" (The Uncle) and along with The Uncle, there was another man who lived in the same building as these generous and gentle soul that became important for Giulio. Unfortunately, his problems came out in one of the worst way possible.

It happened that Giulio met 10-years old Roberto Auglia around the end of January/early February 1976 in a hospital. Giulio was there because of one of his hospitalization while Roberto was there to treat a wart on his foot. The two met and instantly they got along. Giulio went on well with Roberto because of his mental challenges while the kid suffered that the other kids at school tended to exclude him and tend to consider him the weird kid. Roberto- nicknamed Robertino- was found dead on February 10th 1976 on the stove, between the four burner which were all left opened (with gas exiting). Since he was excluded at school, had no friends and was suffering for this situation, the case was closed as a suicide.

After this event Giulio- who was closed friends with Robertino- began showing symptoms of depressive crisis. Therefore, he was again hospitalized, this time in Milan General Hospital (Policlinico di Milano) having tried to commit suicide twice. What's interesting is that the first time he tried to die he put his head near the open kitchen burners (the same way Roberto was found). While Giulio was in the hospital, the autopsy for Robertino's death came back and there was no trace of gas in his lungs. He did not die the way it appeared to. It was soon established that the 10 years old died because of asphyxiation with a pillow. The reenactment alleged that Giulio, who tried to repress his sexuality, tried to assault him. When Roberto tried to oppose him, Giulio took a pillow and pressed it on the kid's face, killing him. He set up the scene to make it look like a suicide and left. He even took part in the funeral, making comments about the funeral and the kid's death to the florist and himself. When it was discovered Giulio was responsible, he called Lo Zio and his neighbour (who apparently Giulio nicknamed ""il nonno"" --> ""the grandpa"" stating his innocence. It is alleged that it is possible he didn't even realize it was his fault Roberto died because of his mental problems. He was indicted for volountary manslaughter, kidnapping and sexual assault. During his interrogations- which took place in the hospital, where he was guarded by the Italian Police- he kept insisting he was innocent and he was hurt by Roberto's death. The psychiatric evaluation established his partial mental infirmity thus, all of his charges were changed to second-degree manslaughter/unintentional homicide. According to the judges he did not kidnap Roberto nor tried to sexually assault him. He was sentenced to six years in prison + 3 years in a treatment center. After a little more than a year, he was released, not deemed socially dangerous and still partially mentally sick. He was supposed to receive costant care after exiting (possibly not only in a clinic/center, but also outpatient therapy) but he never did, escaping from a clinic he stayed at for a while.

After this he again kept wandering from hospital to hospital until he arrived at ""Casetta don^(2) Mario Cavalleri"" in Cremona, a charity institution aimed at giving a place to stay to homeless people. He stayed there just a few months after which, the region (in this case Lombardy) decided for him to be fostered by a family in the same city, Cremona. With a new family, new setting and extinguished legal issues, Giulio could finally start a new.

Unfortuantely, once again, his problem resurfaced. It happened that Giulio started to spend time in a place it would have been better he hadn't. The parish, a very common hangout for kids in Italy, mainly in northern Italy. There, he sometimes helped in serving kids stuff like snacks or beverages like soft drinks (or for the adults coffees etc). After a while though it was a common opinion (to Giulio too) that he was not the best option for that type of job and he was let go.

He found a new job with a tv crew who were in town to film some type of TV show about Giuseppe Verdi's life. He got a job as extra and to take care of some of the costumes and accessories used on the show, which were stored in the basement of an abandoned hospital.

On August 15th 1979 (a day of holiday in Italy, not only because it's summer), Giulio met 7 years old Luca Antoniazzi in the former hospital yard. The two knew each other (Luca attended the parish to play with his friend and met Giulio there) and when Giulio proposed to him to follow him to take a look to the materials from the crew, Luca followed him without a doubt. Once they reached the basement, Giulio tried to sexually assault Luca who tried to oppose and scream for help; but to no avail as nobody could hear him screaming from there. Giulio put his hands around Luca's neck and strangled him until he stopped breathing. He then, hid the kid's lifeless body under a service elevator no longer in use. The same thing that happened three years prior in Milan, happened in basically the same way in Cremona. The kid's body was found after two days of search, which started immediately after Luca's parents reported their kid's disappearance, by a police dog. Two seamstresses from the crew, interviewed by the police, reported a strange event that happened on the afternoon of August 15th: Giulio went to them wearing only his underwear. Upon being asked why he wasn't dressed, he answered that he fell down, got dirty and the two women agreed to wash his clothes, accepting his explication. The police went to interview him, pressuring him and Giulio confessed, bringing the police to the point he killed Luca.

\--------------------------------------***Final Details and Sentences*** \------------------------------------

The couple who fostered him, was heartbroken knowing what he did, saying that he ""had a gentle soul, he couldn't bear hearing a child crying"". Giulio begged with his foster father ""not to abandon him, and to come visit him, and that he would be cured this time, that it wouldn't be like the last time \[in Milan\] and that he would be cured.""

He was sentenced to life in prison for voluntary manslaughter. To this day, he appears to have disappeared from the news. It is not known if he is still in prison, if he is alive, if his foster family is still in contact with him.

What stayed with me while reading of this case (first time I read it, it was on a book) is that ""he couldn't bear hearing a child crying \[...\] so he did what he could to silence them... kill them"".

For what concerns suor Diletta, she attempted to escape instead of serving her sentence, being harbored by a friend. The two were caught and landed in jail, suor Colomba for her crimes, the friend for harboring a fugitive. Suor Diletta always claimed her innocence. It is not know what happened to her after jail. It is pretty certain she died but it isn't know if she did in prison, if she got out early or if she managed to escape to the US.

\*nowadays that would be 1.62... USD

^(1)here is important to say that mental hospitals back then were NOT a nice place to stay- maybe not even now they are- but back then it was almost like being in prison. I cannot say more because I don't know more but the patients were treated horribly, the situation improved a bit with a specific law, but that would come a lot more later than the moment I'm writing about.

^(2)it is important to note that ""don"" in this case does not mean anything mafia relate. Don is a term specific for priests in the italian roman catholic church system. I made this point just to be clear and not avoid confusion.

1i9baez,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1i9baez/anxious_attachment_bf_dumped_fearful_avoidant_gf/,Anxious attachment BF dumped Fearful Avoidant (?) GF,"So I, 19M, and my ex, 18F first met each other on a dating app and instantly hit it off, to the point where we both deleted the app that day and started our ""talking stage"", which she was very adamant about being loyal and committed, which I was very fine with, actually I saw that as an attractive trait. The reason I was on that app was because I was genuinely looking for someone to put my time and effort into, but she soon told me that her reason for being on there was trolling purposes and that she wasn't trying to get into a relationship, but that she DID find something in me. To preface all this, we are about 40 mins away from each other, but due to my mom being super strict, I kind of have to hide this relationship from her so I could see her, so we would maybe see each other 2-4 times a month consistently since we became official. A couple of red flags started popping up where she would get jealous if I went out with my only friend (after highschool I moved and only had one friend nearby) who is a DUDE, and she would start pulling back a bit after I got back from hanging out with him, now I don't know whether that was bc she was upset at me or because of her attachment style, but nonetheless I did my best to assure her and I was thinking it was all going good. Around a month into the talking stage, right before we were going official, she pulled back totally and left me on delivered for a day and came back and apologized for it stating she was afraid that she would pour so much into the relationship for it to crumble in a year or so, I kept telling her that no matter what, we wouldn't breakup off an argument and that she would have to do something in the vain of cheating to get that treatment from me. After that stuff was going good up until 4-5 months in our relationship where she started getting more and more silent and less ""lovey"". I would barely get anxious in the relationship but this triggered something in me where I started spamming her asking what went wrong and why this all spiraled, which of course made her pull back for a whole day just for her to block me on everything and tell me that she loved me, cared for me, and wishes the best for me but she doesn't think the relationship would work out. Her saying she wished I found someone for me kind of threw me off cause she HATED the thought of me going out to parties because of other girls, so I thought it was over for real. Later that DAY, she unblocks me from Instagram, and of course as an unknowing AA, I immediately dmed her and asked her why she unblocked and that if we can talk. We spoke it out and she let me know of the troubles she was currently facing in her life and that she got kicked out her moms house and is house hopping and that she needs time for herself to build herself up and that I can do what I want til then. I asked her if she saw us being together after her situation was cleared and she said yes. I got a bit worried that she would find someone new during that time but she like me know that she doesn't even have time for a relationship let alone meeting another man, so that I shouldn't be worried about it (I am pretty insecure about that being a fat dude growing up and having my first relationship be with a very pretty girl that gets hit on a ton). We then hung out twice at my place and cuddled and did the devil's tango and all that sorta stuff over the past month while we were still in ""friendship stage"" and it was really intimate... besides the fact that I would tell her I miss her and she would reply, ""I know"" and I would tell her I love her so much and just nothing would come out of her mouth. But besides that, it was like the girl I've loved and held all these months. Literally nothing changed in our relationship besides us going from texting every 15 mins and facetiming every night to us texting once a day and it being really short and having a weird vibe to it. Fast forward a few days ago and I noticed she hid her story from me, and me being anxious of course I went on another account and checked and it was just a cat and a photo of herself. I call her out for leaving me on delivered for 2 days and out of pure anxious emotion, I complained that she was playing me and using me and all of that sort of stuff. She responded that her phone was broken for those two days, and I told her how did she post and why did she block me, she responded that it was because she didn't want me to see her photos cause it would make me sad knowing that we were still stuck in this limbo (which is valid cause I brought that concern up in the past but even I knew that that excuse was kinda bullshit lol). She expressed how I was tripping and that we needed to cut communication (just like how she said it the previous time), but I could tell she didn't want to, or else she would have immediately like last time. I tell her that I wanted to call or text her that night to simply talk out our minor problems (which I've been asking her to do for 1-2 months now) or else the relationship would be over. It hit 11:00 PM and no response for hours upon hours, so I write my final text which I told her she was right in the fact that I shouldn't be putting the stress the relationship is having on me, onto her, especially with what she is going through and that I was grateful in meeting her and loving her and wished her well. I woke up the next day and she mutually blocked me and didn't feel the need to say anything to me on her spam account, which she blocked me from too. It has been 4 days and I miss her so damn much, I feel so deeply connected to her on so many levels. I have been thinking about reaching out soon, in like a week or so and go out for a coffee ""date"" and just speak things out and get a feel for the situation. i don't know. I'm just stuck on losing her and I can't even wrap my head around the fact that she might still be in love with me. I don't know if her surroundings is what is making me go crazy or if she is a fearful avoidant or not. I only think that because I remember often if she would space out texts an hour each and I replicated it, she would get super anxious about me and ask if I was okay and that I did not have good energy over text. I just don't know what I should do. Any advice would help. Except get over her... I can't get over someone that could still be in love with me. :/",1,1737767150.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

I went to my doctor and they basically did nothing for over a month. After a month and a half they finally ordered a chest x-ray which showed clear. 

I had been choking on solid chunks of mucus stuck in my throat to the point where I would almost throw up after 6 months it stopped being solid chunks and now is basically white phlegm with small white chunks of mucus almost watery that I am coughing up every 5 minutes this section has been going on for over a year now. Every 5 minutes I have to spit up phlegm or I start having issues swallowing. The doctor insist that there is no issue that they can find and will not assist me. 

Is there any advice or suggestions to get rid of this white phlegm? 

Some crucial information. 
I don't drink coffee pop or anything besides water and the occasional bubble tea. 
I don't smoke do any kind of drugs and the worst kinds of foods I eat is hamburgers and french fries from McDonald's I often eat Asian style cuisine. 
I am approximately 230 lb with a BMI of 36. Yes I know I am considered obese I've been trying to lose weight for 2 years and I still can't lose any weight despite reducing daily calories down to around 1,200

I have struggled with acid reflux since I was 8 years old diagnosed after I was almost hospitalized by choking and coughing up blood. 
Since then I've been on prescription anti acid pills Pantoprazole. I take this every single day if I don't take it for 3 days my acid comes back hard enough to cause me to have to force my self to throw up three or four times to release the acid in my throat otherwise I will be in immense pain. 

I am looking for a way to stop this phlegm as it is interrupting every portion of my life and causing everything to be so messy I don't always have the ability to use Kleenex or other things so I'm constantly having to clean or go outside and cough up the phlegm if I'm not home. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I can solve this? My research online shows nothing really helpful that I don't already do besides possibly a scar in my esophagus. 

Please help. Note I am in Ontario Canada. Doctors will never order tests unless absolutely necessary like life threatening. ",1,1737767074.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

My teeth are so tight, even after braces, I can't get traditional floss or interdental brushes between them even if that would be better. Waterpik is the best I can do... I'm trying.

So understand that my teeth have some gross buildup in these pics. As of this point my dentist STILL hasn't done a deep cleaning, or even a regular cleaning. I was told at my last appointment— (Jan 11) when he lectured me about how I needed ""better dental hygiene"" or I was going to get gum disease and my teeth could fall out etc etc! But didn't actually tell me what I should be doing better! It felt more like he was trying to scare me than actually, you know, help me? Im 25 yrs old and it felt like he was treating me like a teenager—anyway, they said that he would be doing all the fillings and crowns at my next appointment (today)

I only needed two small fillings, an older crown (like 10 yrs) replaced, and a temporary filling from a root canal now needs a crown. This is because they didn't give me the full filling before the braces went on, despite me asking them to. The specialist who did the root canal said to get a full filling as soon as possible, and that was all it needed. Yeah... temporary filling from 2022 obviously didn't hold up well! That's why I wanted the full filling done before my braces went on. And they refused, just pushed me towards braces and said ""hopefully that filling doesnt fall out"". In hindsight this should've maybe been a red flag.

ANYWAY... got the fillings today. Didn't get the crowns! Or a cleaning! Same dentist that was trying to scare me before, didn't talk much this time, didn't tell me why we had to do crowns separately, or why I still didn't get my regular cleaning. He also didn't tell me if I should avoid eating, only eat certain foods, etc. The hygienist/assistant didn't tell me either, but it looked like they used a light to cure it? So it's probably not a metal filling. I'm not numb anymore. but confused, and hungry lol. Can I eat decently hard foods? Or should I wait til tomorrow? ALSO... Im concerned about one of these fillings.

The second tooth from the left, where Im fully exposing my gums, is where I got the filling. The decay was on the outside, but it went all the way up to the gum line. It hurt a bit to touch it and brush there. Does it look weird? To me it looks like they didn't go all the way up, and theres still some discoloring right near the gums. Isnt that bad? Could it decay further since it's so close to my gums?

Sorry this is such a long question but I went from having no dental anxiety to ALL OF IT because of these past two visits! My dentist just straight up doesn't tell me anything and that's what makes me worry. I know it's kind of on me to ask certain questions, but after I have tools and a bite-guard-thing jammed into my mouth and I have to hear the sound of those awful drills for however long, Im exhausted and not really thinking about it! And now I have to go BACK to get the crowns done? And he still hasnt even done a cleaning. I feel like my teeth look awful after having braces and like somehow I did a bad job taking care of them because of all the gross buildup! I never had to get a de-scaling before!

Im considering going to a different office to get a second opinion on the filling and possibly my gum health :( I already dislike the location to begin with (they take a lot of kids/families so the waiting room is awful, it's always a 45 min wait even if you show up on time etc) so I was thinking about switching locations already... but for my actual teeth, I don't know if it's really just me, it's all my fault for not taking care of my teeth, and the filling looks fine and it will all be fine if I just stay and get the crowns with this dentist (will he ever give me my regular cleaning, I wonder?) I'm just a ball of stress about it now, AND i have retainers to worry about keeping clean now too... thats for a different sub.

Again sorry this is like 4 questions in one, I tried to make that clear in the title. If anyone, professional or otherwise has any advice or input about the filling, Id really appreciate it.",0,1737767001.0,askdentists,1,0.5,False

1i9b783,https://i.redd.it/aw4e0wm6h1fe1.jpeg,Carb Stone issues/questions,"Hi all, 

I've been making cold brew for a few years and recently started kegging it and putting it on tap with 100% nitro.

My setup: 
- 2 tap kegerator (1 side is used for beer) 
- Corny keg (5gal)
- Carb lid with carb stone at the pickup
- Really sweet tap handle I got from The Roasterie in Kansas City (Pic for attention) 

My issue: 
The keg lid with the carb stone will back flow after the nitrogen tank runs out and I noticed that I had coffee coming up through the gas line and leaking into the fridge.
I'm in the process of replacing the gas line and ball lock to avoid any contamination. 
For reference, this is the lid I'm using: https://a.co/d/e6OKjz8

My question:
Is the carb stone necessary? I know it's preferred if you want it to cascade and to have a nice creamy texture, which I do. But is there another way to get this without allowing a chance for the coffee to back flow? 
Is there a more preferred keg lid compared to the Ferroday one linked above? 

Thanks in advance.

1i9b0jp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1i9b0jp/first_time_in_seattle_outoftowner_food_reviews/,First Time In Seattle Out-Of-Towner Food Reviews.,"Just got back from Seattle after doing a food research and development trip with a group for 10 days. We went to quite a few (probably too many) spots and thought that I'd share our thoughts!

**Family Friend:** Great space, great staff. Really don't understand all the hype surrounding them. The burger was phenomenal (anything is with kewpie mayo) the fried chicken plate was lack-luster and lacking seasoning both in the chicken and sides. It also arrived cold. Corn soup was great but had hardly any chicken. I'd expect ""chicken thighs"" to mean more than 3 cubes of chicken. The buñuelo were really bitter. For the price-point and hype I expected much better. Great burger though. We REALLY didn't appreciate being offered sides of sauces, including ketchup, only to be charged 2 dollars a sauce (.50 for ketchup) come on, work that into the pricing of the already expensive mains 1.5/5

**Saint Bread:** Overall fantastic and the line and hype is deserving. The laminated pastry products were some of the best I've ever tasted. Apple Tahini Danish was a stand-out. Like a sophisticated apple slices with peanut-butter. Loved the flavors and texture of the yuzu pound cake. Matcha white chocolate rice-krispy treat was very well balanced. Baguette sandwich was enjoyable, I loved the radicchio mix you dont normally see. The egg salad sandwich was served on hard bread, like the fridge had dried it out, and had a bit too much nori for my taste. 4.5/5

**Oriental Mart @ Pike Place Market:** We had a few small bites at ""iconic"" Market joints and most weren't notable but Oriental Mart's Salmon Sinigang (sour and umami in the best ways possible), Chicken Adobo (falling off the bone) and Longganisa (fat greasy sweet and salty goodness) was some of the best Filipino food we have ever had. Nothing was bad or worth any criticism here. We all loved the vibe and decor as well. 5/5

**Spinasse:** Best restaurant of our trip. Insanely good. We got nearly everything on the menu to share. The stand-outs were the Cipollini ripieni (beef pork stuffed onions) and Risotto with braised oxtail and aged balsamico. Im still thinking about that risotto. Most of the pasta dishes were very thin angel-hair-esque cuts and we only wish there was more shape variety like the agnolotti. only lack-luster items we had were the roasted duck (very very chewy) and beef cheek (too many warming spices, like a big piece of xmas beef). Had a great Negroni there as well. We loved all the desserts like the huckleberry semifreddo and the Zuppa inglese but the chocolate cake is what dreams are made of. This was the one and only ""high-end"" restaurant we dined at where the prices matched the quality and service. We loved how PNW flavors were mixed with good ""true"" Italian food. 4.8/5

**Miss Pho**: Great pho, great service, great vibes. THE BEST Summer Taro Rolls I've had and some of the best pho too. THE BEST SHRIMP TOAST. We loved the addition of the creamy egg in the beef shank Phở Hà Nội. The charred pork was insane. Nearly everything was expertly cooked. We found the fried dumplings to be a bit plain and the salt and pepper tofu to be lacking in the iconic salt and pepper seasoning flavors. 4.8/5

**Beast and Cleaver:** The biggest disappointment of our trip. We were really looking forward to this one and we cant believe how let down we were by the experience. We went for the ""Beastro"" menu offering and got every item listed (other than every cut of meat) and we couldn't believe how homogenous everything that was house-made tasted as well as was presented. We ordered every paté (a basque style, one I cant remember the name of and a pork rillette) and all were presented the same way: really good mustard, very harsh pickled/vinegared apples and super hard crostinis. It would've been really nice to have different pickles or compliments to each paté instead of them all being the same. They, unfortunately, all tasted the same to us as well, flat and not much going on. Our server was just not great at being a server. There seemed to be a vibe shift when they realized we weren't going to order any wine (most of us don't drink wine) and we weren't really aware of the expectation to get wine prior to booking our table. Plates were delivered to our table with no explanations or comments, not many questions asked about how we were doing and very short responses when we did ask a question. Not a very warm or welcoming experience. We asked to stagger our dishes so we could enjoy them (2 hour limit) and were told that wasn't possible because the steaks take 30 minutes to cook, which ended up not being true. All of the sides were aggressively just ok. The kobocha squash was covered in sauces/aoli that was just odd to most of us, the gratin potatoes had cold spots and lacked seasoning and the endive salad wasn't properly prepared and used some of the funkiest blue cheese (and we all love cheese) making it burn-your-sinuses inedible for us. We ordered the A5 Waygu and Pork Chops. We all love a rare steak, never going above medium rare, we weren't asked how we would like our cuts cooked, only one cut was listed as being served rare, Both cuts arrived blue. I think that the risk of raw pork has been blown out of proportion in American dining culture but this pork hardly had a sear on it and was still below room temp cold in the middle. The kind of rare where you have to keep chewing and chewing. What rubbed us the wrong way about this is that we heard the chef tell the server that he thought the pork chop was too rare and the server said ""nah, dont worry about it they ordered it that way"" no, we absolutely did not. We weren't asked at all how we wanted our cuts prepared. That really bothered all of us at the table. The A5 was A5, its hard to mess that up. Again, too blue for most of our tastes but it was an incredible slice of beef that melted in your mouth and seasoned with a bit too much salt. Both these cuts absolutely didn't take 30 minutes to cook. The dessert was awful. A cross between a classic English Pudding and a Tres Leches. We weren't asked how anything was while we were eating so at the end of our meal we told them to not box up the pork chop because it's simply too rare for us to enjoy. The server took it back to the chef (this is a small space) and he seemed honestly bent about our criticism (we think because the server lied about how we ordered it). We saw him throw the cut up pork slices in the oven for about 5 minutes, box it up and had the server drop it on our table saying he fixed it. We opened it up and it was maybe a degree less rare. We found this a tad passive aggressive especially after saying we weren't interested in taking it home. To add to this, the chef then came to our table and told us that if we wanted a cut cooked a certain way we should've told him how to cook it, we told him our server didn't ask us nor checked on us and what we overhead about us ordering it rare which received a seemingly empty ""hmmmm, ok, sorry"" as he left for the night. I do want to say that the server then informed us that he went ahead and took the pork chop off of our bill and tried to chum up with us at the very end of the night but then commented on bars we had visited as being pretentious (look at your wine bottles, dude) and not good. A very odd experience. Everything was priced very reasonably and fair but we think they should stick to being a butcher shop. We were hoping there would be more offerings like the ones that they post on their instagram as well as the burger that Beard awarded them for. ""The Beastro"" explanation on their website is just too vague to know what to expect. We didn't get the hype. Maybe The Peasant is better? 2/5

**Ballard Bars:** Most were crazy with the prices (15 dollars for a shot????) but **Percy's & Co. Seattle:** One of the ""pretentious"" bars we went to in Ballard. It was so ""pretentious"" that we saw a bar fight and I got a free shot of Malort. Great innovative cocktails, pricey, but worth it. The matcha and sesame oil one is incredible and I got a great garlic infused gin dirty martini. Josh is THE MAN behind that bar! 4.5/5

**Mean Sandwich:** Amazing, Amazing, Amazing. Couldn't believe how warm and welcoming everyone was. The corned beef with slabs of corned beef, cabbage slaw, mint, mustard on a potato bun was the favorite item of the trip. What a unique and delicious combo. We all loved the crispy potatoes and thought that the burger was great too. Great vibes, great people, great humor. We have no criticisms. Loved it 5/5

**Un Bien:** We split up the number 2 between the group and were blown away. Flawless sandwich. The bread had a great chew and the garlic sauce went great with the melt in your mouth pork shoulder and expertly cooked onions. 5/5

**Seawolf**: We had their bread around town and decided to visit their shop. I take issue with their pricing of bread (5-7 dollars for a baguette in their store yet 10 in some shops around town) I have years of bread experience and honestly find their pricing to be unethical, especially for the quality of product but this may be a Seattle pricing thing. Everything was beautiful but nothing was outstanding here. The savory and sweet danish were both good. A butter croissant shouldn't cost as much as a baguette. Good bran muffin. 3/5

**Temple Pastry**: A miss for all of us. We got nearly everything in the case and it just wasn't good or particularly bad. Products listed with big flavors all fell flat and the dough in the laminated products lacked any fermentation complexities. I had high hopes for the shortbreads and all were way too soft. Very pretty products all presented well. Great baguette. 3.5/5

**Coyle's Bakeshop:** Easily the smallest portions in a bakery I have ever been to. The Kouign-amann was the size of a golf ball and a half. I mean, what the hell? This would be fine if the prices reflected she size or the craft of the product. They didn't. Our millionaire shortbread was missing half of the base of shortbread and they forgot the coconut macaroons we ordered (didn't open the box until we were back to our hotel) The brownie strip was a really odd choice of portioning as well. pretty good canelé and although small, the Kouign-amann was one of the crunchiest I've had in awhile. Great flavors, poor pricing. 2.5/5

**Ben's Bread:** The Best bakery of the trip. Absolutely nothing was bad or mediocre here. All hits. Great English Muffin breakfast sandwich and baguette sandwich. We got nearly everything in the case but what stood out to me the most was: The olive oil cake with whipped cream and cranberry compote, citrus bar with candied citrus, streusel coffee cake, toffee apricot financier and the coconut donut with the coconut cream (best I've ever had) filled donut hole and brioche twist. Ben and his team know what they are doing. Complex yet perfectly balanced sourdough, bold and unique flavors, all praise is well deserved. Great folks, great vibes, great to see the owners in the trenches with their team. 5/5

**Byen Bakery:** Overall ok. Most of the products were dry. The cinnamon roll had great flavors as well as the cardamom bun with coconut vanilla cream. Generous portions. Butterball and fold cookies tasted too much like vegetable shortening. They had a ""mass-produced"" vibe to them 2.8/5

**Bar Del Corso**: Just ok. Nothing really stood out to us. Meatballs had a funk to them we didn't really like, Calabrian sausage was ok, arancini was arancini, table bread was far too sour, mushroom pizza was alright. Nothing was inspired. Good Negroni. 3/5

**Coupe and Flute:** Great vibes, great staff, great drinks not fans of the food. The deviled eggs had wasabi or horseradish in the filling and it was far too much of it, popcorn with butter was $7 dollars for a small bowl and the French Onion soup was pretty good. Super mushy apple crisp. Again, too much hype but I'd go back for a drink. 3.5/5

**Milstead & Co:** We went to a few coffee shops while visiting and this was our favorite. Super friendly staff. The salted caramel latte was insane, life changing insane. Great mocha too. The cute barista complimented my shirt so this gets a 5/5

**Viveeine's Bistro:** Another just ok spot. Nothing was outstanding, nothing was bad. We got fried pork belly that tasted like nutella, funnel cakes and powdered sugar for some reason. We were fans of the toothpick lamb. 3/5

**Communion**: Another huge let-down, offensively so. We were seated 30 minutes past our reservation time which is always a pet peeve of mine especially when we had to put a deposit down for a reservation that has a late/no show charge agreement to it. The staff was very attentive in the beginning , kind and took the time to explain what Communion was about which was appreciated by all of us. The concept behind Communion is unique and inspired. Unfortunately, the food was not. First off, the menu posted on their website, at the time of booking (week before visiting), was not the same menu that was offered that night. Disappointing to not be able to order what we were looking forward to like the pork neck bone soup and banana pudding but fine, we can pivot. To start we ordered the yeast rolls and hoecakes. The yeast roll, because only one is served even though its plural, was totally raw in the middle with a ""whipped"" crab butter that was hard as a rock making it impossible to spread on the bread. The hoecakes tasted great but had bristles from a basting brush all over them. The Hood sushi, we were told was the most popular item, was grocery store sushi tier. Nothing going on at all in that roll, flat, fishy and chewy in a bad way. random pockets of chili or cayenne in some pieces that left some of us with burning tongues and some of us with no heat at all. The grilled okra which was promised to be slime free was full of slime (which im fine with but others in my party were not) due to not being grilled properly. One side of a piece of okra would be totally raw while another side on the same piece was burnt to a crisp. Totally uneven seasoning on the pieces as well. The Big Ass Shrimp were very good but the béarnaise sauce was broken and gritty. The collard greens were cooked perfectly but the turkey cheeks were far too salty. I really wish all the salt in the turkey cheeks went to where it was needed like in the okra. The ""better than your grandma's mac n cheese"" was definitely not better than my grandma's because she knows how to make a roux without breaking it and how to season appropriately as well. Super chunky and clumpy. Underwhelmed by the apps and shared plates we decided to just split the one main we ordered in the begining, the fried pork chop. This was the best thing here. The chop was moist, juicy and had a nice pink middle and was well seasoned. The mushroom gravy was lacking and the ""fried cabbage"" was totally raw. You cannot tell me that cabbage touched a pan that night. We also got pieces of the tough woody base of the cabbage due to poor cleaning which really was the final straw for all of us. We would've complained and informed our server but we didn't see them again until the bill drop. Our server seemed really busy and we were so tired of having discussions about poor food at James Beard, NYT and Eater acclaimed Seattle spots that we just paid and left. This restaurant rubbed us all the wrong way. What Communion claims they are doing is cool, noble and unique but what they are doing like having $55 ($25 for a pound over at Jackson's Catfish Corner) farm raised catfish on the menu is, ironically, going against what they say they are doing. We read about the history of the neighborhood Communion is located in and how it has struggled with gentrification through the decades and honestly Communion is contributing to that problem. All of these dishes have the potential to be charged as the prices that were listed, if they were good, but to put plates infront of us that were unsafely cooked, had physical contamination, and really just half assed is downright insulting. I'd be happy to pay $10 for just one roll and crab butter, at an ""upscale"" restaurant if it's deserving of that price. And nothing here was deserving. The food at Communion is simply not attainable to the folks they seemingly made this restaurant for. We loved the focus on local products, ingredients and food culture but it's just squandered. ""Everybody's gotta eat"" is not an appropriate mantra for this establishment. I felt almost performative eating here. 1/5

**Breadfarm:** in Edison WA an hour north but worth saying how great the bread and shortbread all was. 4/5

**Howdy Bagel**: In Tacoma, but worth saying it was some of the best bagels we have ever had. The Chili crispy cream cheese spread was fantastic and it was full of good folks and good vibes. 4.5/5

**Local Tide:** One of our top 3 spots. So so so so good! That Black Cod puts Nobu's Cod to shame! Melt in your mouth buttery goodness. Spicy Fish sandwich with sichuan peppercorns and mala mayo was great, salmon belly dip was insane, shrimp toast, fantastic chips, great chowder. Flawless in our eyes. 5/5

Overall, we learned our lesson to not trust James Beard, NYT or Eater lists when we go to our next city. It was really surprising that the worst food of our trip was from the most acclaimed spots. Some of the Beard awards were for specific items, like the burger at Beast and Cleaver, and they dont even do said items anymore. It was a very interesting and confusing pattern that we all noticed and made us wonder about the politics and culture behind food review and award programs and organizations based in Seattle. We havent had this problem following Beard acclaimed spots prior but maybe it's just how they are going now in 24/25.

I mostly sat down to write this to see what locals think about these highly acclaimed spots not delivering on the acclaim. Are we just too picky or is this a Seattle thing?",38,1737766362.0,Seattle,35,0.84,False

I am the only woman in an office with 5 men, I get on with everyone, we have a laugh and are working well together but there is one man who insults me at every opportunity. 
I am in my 40’s, I think he is mid/late 50’s. He seems like a nice bloke and when I first started I thought we would get on well but every single day he insults me ‘jokingly’. Comments like ‘she isn’t as stupid as she looks’, ‘I’d better check your work as you’ve probably done it wrong’, ‘the only useful thing you do is get in early and turn on the heating’. I also found out today he has cancelled orders I have placed without telling me or the supplier. This aswell as questioning everything I do even though I have over 20 years of experience in this field. He doesn’t question the other buyer in the office (in fact, he gets in a bit earlier to make him a coffee! I don’t even get a ‘good morning’). I am also partially deaf- I made everyone aware on my first day but he always speaks softly (only to me - normal volume to the others) so I have to ask him to repeat himself several times
He is on holiday next week and I am covering his stuff and as I left tonight I said ‘ I hope you have a lovely relaxing week off’. His reply was - ‘I can’t wait to see the mess I come back to’. 
Also, when handing over issue to me in front of a colleague he names me but put my job title in air quotes, belittling me. 
He picks at everything I do. I am a really conscientious person at work and rarely make an action without giving it proper thought but he questions everything I do (he is not my manager, in fact my position is above his) 
It is really starting to grate on me. 
Also…First day back after Xmas he called me into the bosses office to ‘discuss something sensitive’. He noticed I was wearing a Fitbit and said it made him feel uncomfortable. I didn’t understand why but seeing his discomfort I didn’t question him and said I’d take it off and not wear it to work again. However as he is being such a prick I feel like wearing it to work again or calling him out on how he is treating me, pointing out that I was respectful of his feelings regarding the Fitbit so maybe he could respect my position in the workplace and stop being a bitch.",2,1737766252.0,AmIBeingTooSensitive,0,1.0,False

Quick back story. I (m36) have two beautiful boys with me ex partner (f30). We’ve been seperated for 4 years, I’ve been with my current partner (f34) for 3 years. 

As a lot of seperated parents will know, it was absolute chaos, and a lot of pain to get to where we are now. 50/50 for the most part. The boys’ mum, is pretty unreliable, changing pick up/drop off times every single week, some times even the date changes depending on whats going on.. but it’s not about that.

School holidays have been never ending, with expensive vacation care and days off work. 

My kids love my partner, she seems to love them too.. 
we spend a lot of time together, the 4 of us.

She’s had a couple of free days after Christmas, so has offered to watch the boys, which they’re happy to do and she’s been a great help taking a day here and there, for the days I’m responsible for them.

Today has been the last day of care during the week and my partner has looked after the kids while I worked. 

She stressed that the boys had been very off, stranger than normal at hand over.. and have been causing trouble all day.. I offered for her to drop them to work with me, I can accommodate at work. It’s just not ideal for them, I’d rather them at home if possible. She declined. 

I come home this afternoon, grab the boys and take them over to the pool for a couple of hours. My partners friend was round having a glass of wine, so thought to let them catch up while I spend time with the kids. 

Her friend leaves, my partner has had a couple of glasses of wine. (The wine, for me, is becoming a problem.. it’s been more frequent of late, and she can get quite drunk, I barely drink)

She starts to talk to me about her day, about the boys and how have they been. She starts to get quite upset. 

She talks to me about a conversation between herself and my oldest, about how he’s been ‘told’ to tell her, that she’s just a stepmom, and can’t tell him what to do… which has came from the mum/or the grandmother.. She proceeds to tell me, that she recorded a conversation today, between herself and my oldest boy.. to show me what he’s like when I’m not there.. 

Which I thought was quite strange.. as if for evidence? 

She then, goes on to tell me, that while we were playing, she went through my oldest sons’ iPad, and read messages between him and his mum.. infront of her friend. And spoke about it with said friend, at length. about her, and not the nicest kind of messages. (I told her mum, I told her what you wanted me to say. Told her she’s just a stepmom and doesn’t get to tell me what to do.) 

Now, I’m not a massive fan of their mother. She’s been pretty unreal about the whole break up and care and girlfriends etc.. there’s been a lot go on, I was struggling at one point, not being able to see the boys. But anyways, I’m passed it, life is good, and I’ve learned the hard way, about not holding grudges, not letting people surprise me anymore, and actually letting things go.

My partner has grew a massive hate for my ex, to the point I try to avoid conversations about her, as it leads down a rabbit hole and it’s hard to get her out of it. You put your dick in her, how did you have kids with such an awful person? All that carry on, which I find pretty childish. I try to laugh it off, she knew I had kids when I met her.

Now, I understand that these messages may not have been nice, even now after 4 years. And I know that it’s coming from a very dark, unmaternal place.. but, the ex will parent how she sees fit, I don’t agree with it, and I do hope the boys see it for what it really is when they’re older. But I’ll never say a bad word to my kids, about their mother, or my partner. I will never be that guy. 

But, recording a conversation.. without my kids knowledge? Seems wild… but then telling me that she’s went through his messages? To his mum.. whether good bad or ugly, are private!! I don’t care if he’s 8 he has contact with his mum, as much as he has contact with me.. but also went through these messages, with her friend, who we see twice a year? To me.. is absolutely out of order? 

Now my partner is quite drunk, I sat and listened, and I agree.. what his mother is doing is not good parenting, I believe the way she is with my oldest is quite unhealthy, I’ve mentioned it a few times, but get the normal, angry responses. But yeah, I tried to explain that it is going to happen sometimes, his mum is going to bad mouth us directly to him. But I tried to put the conversation off until tomorrow, when she’s sober. She wouldn’t have it, followed me around the house, raising her voice, infront of the kids. I asked her to stop maybe 15 times.. got told to fuck off, fuck all of you. Won’t watch the kids anymore, hates the ex, hates that I defend her. Really lost her temper with me, when all i asked, was that we cut it and continue on in the morning after a coffee.. 

What do I do here? I very nearly asked her to leave.. the way she went in at me, was nuts.. I understand why she is angry, but I can’t ignore the recording and going through messages? I’m currently writing this, on the couch. Kids are safe asleep, and she’s upstairs, sending me messages, going on with the same conversation. When I’ve clearly asked her to stop… any help would be appreciated. Thanks ",30,1737766147.0,WhatShouldIDo,82,0.79,False

I've not been officially diagnosed with ARFID but all the symptoms are there. I've been trying so hard to eat when I first get up but my entire day is a right with food. It's almost 8pm and I've barely eaten a sandwich. I can't figure out how to eat proper. 

I don't understand what puts me off about food. I know I don't like bland food. I tend to like extreme flavors. Don't like crunchy most of the time. I like chicken nuggets, I seem to have an obsession with protein when I do try to find things. I hate bread, flat bread is okay though. 

I was basically force fed my entire childhood so eating at all is a struggle. Mom didn't accommodate anyone, I love her but we ate what she wanted to eat or we didn't eat and if I didn't get in there first there were rarely leftovers for the runt of the litter. 

So yeah, I know I like eggs over easy. Bacon is also top tier. Cheeseburgers are good. Fries are the carrier of the ketchup. 

How do I go about figuring out eating on a schedule though? I also do need to figure out what textures and so on. I have no clue where to start with my relationship with food. I want to enjoy it. I do enjoy craft coffee. Food and I are old adversaries though. I just want to eat better so I can start working out again and being active again. I feel like shit. ",1,1737766122.0,ARFID,0,1.0,False

Thanks to the Redditor and people of Texas I was able to buy something I needed today.

That came after the much needed food (grateful for all of that, money meant for food - and I spent it on food - but the no strings attached money hit the spot today. 

....

I stopped at a thrift store to see if they sold a duffle bag. Nope. A sleeping bag in a duffel bag.

This is similar to the bag I gave away, it's not easy to carry, but it does simplify my setup.

Left a clean hoodie, my bedroll (down comforter/tarp/snugpak blanket tied with a climbing rope).

This will be simple to lay out and pick back up in the am. This isn't a long term solution but it helps right now.

I also gave them my hammock bug net.

The best thing is I have access to my drink cup, extra socks and peanut butter.

It also looks a little less hapless.

The bag is starting to tear around the handle, so I'm carrying it a bit awkwardly.

But for hitchhiking, my previous setup was cumbersome. Two people actually stopped and told me no after they saw it. I don't blame them.

....

I had another interaction with the police today. Somebody called in because I hadn't moved for 15 minutes. 

(Two interactions today in Bourne, TX.)

It could have been an hour or more. I was asleep and the sirens woke me.

I'm not hitchhiking until I get on the other side of Comfort, TX.

Taking my time, sure. Mainly, two interactions with the Bourne police is enough.

It's at least 10 miles to enter the city. I'll see what it looks like when I get there.

...

Finally hydrated. Washed my socks and hair. Forgot to hydrate. 

Found an AA hall, grabbed some candy, water and a cup of coffee.Much needed water too.

They invited me to stay. The meeting didn't start until 7 and it was 5:40.

If I had stayed maybe I could have snagged a ride. They're a pretty helpful group in my experience. Howeve, I'm in no rush and didn't want to sit thru a meeting.

...

I haven't flown a sign today or even found a dumpster.

When the police officer told me there are services available, I declined but would take a bus ticket.

At least out of Texas. 

Once again this isn't a plea for a bus ticket. Y'all are more than generous.

This is just my experience.

....

For some reason I'm still attached to work. Feeling as if I should. 

I'm trying to relax and just be. 

We'll see.

I can say this though. 

The road is taking such good care of me AS I NEED IT.

Why am I still attached to something that wasn't taking care of me?

1i9awwn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i9awwn,AITAH for getting up set at my sister for not making any effort for anyone at all?,"Hi 

Before reading please excuse I do have dyslexia.
I (25 Female ) absolutely love going above and beyond for everyone. What really gets me upset is when it’s only a one way street. 

Here’s a quick back story on my people pleasing recovery- 

When I met my partner (26 M) who we will call Jake. Jake has always been my biggest cheerleader and therapist in people pleasing (joking but not joking hahah). He has helped me so much to realise only make the effort for the people make effort for you. 

Coming in to 2024 was the biggest challenge, as I had tried to stop to not make all the efforts. I will say during that period I have definitely stood my ground. 

Now, I never take shit from anyone. I will only make as much effort as you will make for me.

Here’s the tea- 

4 out of 6 my siblings including me have children and only 5 out of 6 including me make as much effort with eachother as we can as we do have our own lives. The one person who NEVER makes effort for anyone is my older sister (27 F) who we will call Amy. 

Well, Amy has had the first set of grandchildren (5 years old) who are the most funniest and loving set of twins and a 11 months old baby (who I haven’t really met). Anyway, everytime Amy has asked me to go to the shopping centre near her and I will always come down.  I have to use public transport as I don’t drive but Jake drives (I try not to get him to drive everywhere for me as it can be costly in fuel). So it takes me 1.5 hours to get to her local shops or only a 20 minute direct drive from our houses.

Whenever, I ask her to come up to me when she says she’s doing nothing or she is bored there is an excuse right away. There’s been multiple times she has said I’m bored with the kids and I’ll say come up and see us and your nephew (my son). 

Whenever it’s mentioned WE ARGUE. Now, I really don’t know if it’s because she is getting defensive or if it’s me being an asshole (I have the worst time reading cues due to my dyslexia). I will attach screenshots below of an example of how our interaction will happen after this rant x. Also keep in mind that my sister has only come to my house 2 x in 2 years and that’s it.

Whenever my mother will ask amy to pick something up or to come over for just a coffee she will only agree if mum watches the girls. Which my mum has watched the twins for 5 years once to twice a week EVERY WEEK. When my mum says she’s can’t she will LOOSE HER COOL. Like an adult tantrum. 

It even got that bad where my mum will soon enough this year undergo back surgery and my sister will, palm her children off and say it’s fine you don’t need to hold them. This has caused LOTS OF FIGHTS between Amy and I because my mum was strictly advised to NOT look after children until she’s recovered. 

Fast forward today, it’s been like nearly 5 months since I seen my nieces and yes I get teary about this because I adore them to bits. When I saw them more regularly they always put a smile on everyone and we would always just play random games or gossip (they are seriously so funny). 

Jake has told me multiple times that we can go see them if I need but I stood my ground and said no the moral is she never comes to me, or sees me. I don’t want to have to give in and always let her get what she wants and it is sad because when I call them the girls say when can we see you aunty. 

I message my sister and she tells me she’s bored and I ask her to come over. THEN we start to argue. 
AITH?

1i9askv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MHApeaceRP/comments/1i9askv/end_event_the_raid_cut_4/,[ END EVENT ] [ THE RAID ] [ CUT 4 ],"the aftermath of chaos leaving Kazuyuki alone in the rubble-strewn corridor. Shadows stretched like skeletal fingers across the walls as emergency lights flickered, casting his hunched silhouette into jagged fragments. His breath hitched—a sound too loud in the suffocating silence—as he registered the two figures lingering nearby: the boy who’d cheated death, and the healer whose quirk stank of antiseptic and desperation. *Leftovers*, he thought bitterly, his throat tightening around a laugh that felt like broken glass.

“The guy who ‘died’ and the healer quirk…” Kazuyuki’s voice dripped with a mockery so sharp it could flay skin. He tilted his head, his smile a grotesque mimicry of warmth, cracked at the edges. “Not bad for a pit crew.”

The words curdled in the air. Ewan flinched, his fingers twitching toward the raw, peeling skin around his nails—a compulsive dance of pain and distraction. Kazuyuki didn’t miss it. He never did.

“Man. I just realized something.” Kazuyuki’s voice dropped, the bravado crumbling as he leaned against a shattered concrete pillar. Its rough edges bit into his palm, grounding him. Or maybe punishing him. “I’m not cut out for this bullshit. This place *fucking* sucks.” His laugh was hollow, echoing down the corridor like a ghost. “I’m getting beat up left, right, center. My whole group left me, and… and now I’m stuck with…” He gestured wildly, the motion jerky, unhinged. “A schizophrenic patient and the only student who can heal everyone. What the *fuck*? I didn’t sign up for this. Why *me*? This whole fucking…”

He choked. The flicker of a memory seared his mind—*cold steel tables, the whir of bone saws, Hakamura’s eyes glinting like a scalpel under surgical lights*—and his fist slammed into the wall. Dust rained down, bitter on his tongue.

Then, stillness.

When Kazuyuki turned back, his smile had warped into something feral, unsteady. A marionette’s grin with its strings half-cut. “Hey guys…” He stepped closer, boots crunching over debris. “You wanna take down something even better than a villain?”

Ewan’s stomach lurched.  Kazuyuki’s gaze pinned them—not a request, but a dare. A plea.

“I… I don’t think it’s a good idea,” Ewan whispered, his voice fraying at the edges. His fingertips dug into a raw cuticle, the sting a feeble anchor against the tsunami of *wrongness* crashing through his skull. “But… I don’t want to be left alone. So I guess… I’ll just come.”

Kazuyuki’s eyes narrowed. For a heartbeat, Ewan saw it—a flicker of something fractured in those pitch-black irises. Then Kazuyuki closed the distance, his hand clapping Ewan’s shoulder with a force that bordered on violence. But the grip softened, trembling, as he yanked both students into a bruising embrace. The healer stiffened; Ewan froze. Kazuyuki’s voice vibrated against them, low and raw:

“I *understand*. That feeling of being stranded… all alone…”

***\[Flashback: The Lab\]***  
*Cold. Always so cold. The fluorescent lights buzzed like flies feasting on rot. Kazuyuki’s small hands pressed against the observation glass, fogging it with each shallow breath. Behind him, Hakamura in a white coat murmured numbers, cold and clinicaas the restraints bit into his wrists. “Please,” he’d begged, voice splintering. “Don’t leave me here.” No one answered.*

***\[Flashback: Hakamura’s Glint\]***  
*The doctor’s smile. Always the smile. A crescent moon of cruelty as he adjusted his glasses. “Remarkable resilience,” Hakamura had purred, fingers trailing the scalpel’s edge. “Let’s see how much more you can endure.”*

***\[Flashback: Letting Go\]***  
*The last monitor flatlined. A shrill, endless beep. Kazuyuki’s hand fell limp against the lab floor, his vision blurring. I’m sorry, he thought, not knowing who he was apologizing to. I’m so sorry.*

Kazuyuki jerked back from the embrace as if burned, his breath ragged. A single black tear streaked down his cheek, viscous and iridescent—a relic of Morphie’s corruption. He swiped at it furiously, his teeth bared in a snarl.

“…Things don’t exactly go our way,” he spat, the words jagged. His gaze locked onto the horizon beyond the broken windows, where the sun bled crimson into the sky. “But that’s life. Nothing really goes our way. We adapt. We *survive*.”

He turned, his shadow stretching long and monstrous across the floor. “So let’s go wild.”

The healer hesitated. “Where… are we going?”

Kazuyuki’s laugh was a serrated thing. “A lab.” He didn’t look back as he strode forward, each step cracking the silence like gunfire. “To take down a man who’s got nothing but insatiable greed in his rotten chest.”

The words hung, a guillotine’s promise.

Ewan stared at Kazuyuki’s retreating figure—the tremors in his hands, the way his shoulders hunched as if carrying the weight of every scalpel, every scream. *He’s not okay*, Ewan realized. *None of us are.*

But he followed anyway.

  
Dangers’ boot slammed into the wall, cracking the plaster. His scarred hands trembled—not from fear, but from the white-hot rage simmering in his veins. Kazuyuki’s monologue about labs and “taking down a man” buzzed in his skull like a wasp. *Pathetic*. He spun on his heel, teeth bared, and roared:

**“Bullshit—**!”\*\* The word tore through the room, guttural and raw. **“I don’t listen to** ***anyone*****.”**

He stormed toward the exit, his leather jacket reeking of smoke and old blood. Halfway there, he paused. Glanced back. His voice dropped to a venomous growl: **“But you’re right about one thing. I’m leavin’ this damned place and—**”\*\*

A spike of pain lanced through his skull. Dangers staggered, clawing at his temple. Behind his eyes, the world shifted—foggy, muted. There, cross-legged in the void of his mind, sat Lam Lee. The kid’s single arm rested on his knee, fingers curled in a meditative pose. His braid hung neatly over his shoulder, untouched by the chaos outside.

**“...Just like the old man taught me,”** Lam Lee murmured, eyes closed.

**“The** ***fuck*****?!”** Dangers snarled aloud, shaking his head as if to dislodge him. **“You lost the bet, kid! I take the body for a day—you** ***said*****!”**

Lam Lee’s eyelashes fluttered. When he opened his eyes, there was a weight to his gaze—a sadness that made Dangers’ stomach churn. **“You’re right. I did lose.”**

**“Then** ***shut it*** **and let me—”**

**“But Dangers,”** Lam Lee interrupted, his voice steady as a blade pressed to a throat, **“I can’t let you leave that place.”**

***Something is trying to break free.***

The walls of Dangers’ mind shuddered. Cracks spiderwebbed through the mental landscape. He laughed—a harsh, broken sound. **“The** ***fuck*** **you care what I do?!”**

Lam Lee rose slowly, his braid swaying. **“That door you were at earlier… the one you couldn’t break. Even** ***I*** **sensed it. Someone’s inside. They need our help.”**

**“Listen, you sanctimonious little—”** Dangers’ fist smashed into the concrete wall, splitting his knuckles. Blood dripped, but he barely felt it. **“I don’t** ***give a damn*** **what you say! You lost the bet. Now I’m.** ***Leaving*****.”**

Lam Lee inhaled deeply. The air in the mental space smelled of incense and rain—memories of the old man’s hut. *“You’ve got to focus on your self. Not your personalities,”* the old man had said, calloused hands adjusting Lam Lee’s posture during training. 

***Something is about to break.***

Lam Lee’s throat tightened. He thought of Astra— the way she’d thrown herself in front of danger tosave a stranger. *Heroic*. *Foolish*. A tear slid down his cheek, hot and shameful.

**“I’m sorry, Dangers,”** he whispered.

**“The** ***hell*** **you—”**

Lam Lee’s hand—his *only* hand—snapped upward. A golden thread glinted between his fingers, taut and humming. 

**“I’m sorry for you both.”**

He pulled.

The thread *sang*.

***LAM LEE DELETED DANGERS.***

***\* Lam Lee Has 1/6 Selflessness.***

**Kenta** tilted his head back, the sky a bruised purple-gray above him. His laughter died in his throat, replaced by the metallic tang of blood on his tongue. The ground beneath him felt like broken glass—every pebble digging into his spine a reminder of *him*. His twin’s face flickered in his mind: that same mocking smirk, the way he’d turned his back. *Shitty memory. Shittier ending.*

He gritted his teeth, forcing himself upright. ""You should probably text your class,"" he barked, voice roughened by cracked ribs. ""Tell ’em not to trust anyone who’s been kidnapped. We’ve got less than a minute before the adrenaline wears off… and we *really* start hurting.""

**Uzuki**’s jaw tightened. He fished his phone from his pocket—the screen spiderwebbed with cracks, reflecting his own battered face. His thumb hovered over the class group chat. *Monaco’s smirk. The way his punches had felt… wrong. Too controlled. Too cold.*

\[Monaco betrayed us. Don’t trust anyone. There could be more traitors. Stay together. I’ll meet you soon.\]

He paused, then added: \[Monaco was acting weird. Something’s off. Be careful. He tried to kill me.\]

The *send* button clicked like a gun cocking. Uzuki stared at the sky, his fist clenching until his knuckles blanched. ""...Why is he so *strong*?"" he muttered, the words ash in his mouth.

**Makito** skidded to a halt, his healer’s gloves already glowing faint gold. The students on the ground groaned, their uniforms torn and bloodied. Rage boiled in his gut—*Who did this?*—but he swallowed it, channeling the heat into his palms. ""Who did this to you?"" he asked softly, though he already knew.

**Uzuki** coughed, crimson spattering his chin. ""Monaco Knox. Class 2 rep. He… betrayed us.""

""Ah. Makito. Pleasure."" The healer’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. ""Doubt brought me here. These injuries…"" He gestured at Uzuki’s shattered collarbone. ""If I heal you, will you rush back? This’ll drain me. Don’t expect miracles.""

**Yu** rested a hand on Makito’s shoulder, his voice calm as still water. ""After healing, we hunt Monaco."" He turned to Kenta and Uzuki. ""Is he tired? Injured?""

**Uzuki** raised his palm, heat rippling faintly. ""He is… but someone might heal him."" His eyes narrowed. A cold, flickering signature pulsed in his senses—*wrong*, like ice in a furnace. ‘*That’s…*’ His frown deepened. ‘*I know that chill.*’

**Kenta** hauled himself up, wincing. ""I saw where he went. Bad idea, but I’m following."" He glanced at Uzuki. ""Heal me. Once I’m up, we double-team. I’ll need fire. Just… don’t make it weird if you can’t.""

**Yu** closed his eyes, steadying his breath. ""He went up. We act *now*. React later.""

**Kenta**’s gaze locked on Monaco’s abandoned sword. ""I can track him. If he’s with another, split them. Four of us—me vs. Monaco, you handle the rest. Can’t use Genbu, but I’ve got options. Or swarm him if he’s alone.""

**Uzuki**’s tail lashed, snagging the blade. He tossed it to Kenta. ""Here. Return it when done.""

**Kenta** shredded his torn tracksuit top, fashioning a makeshift sheath across his back. Metal scraps clinked as he swallowed them, jaw working. ""Almost time to hunt,"" he growled, crouching in a runner’s stance. ""You three keeping up?""

**Uzuki** snorted. ""*I* should ask *you*."" His golden ring glinted as he pointed northwest. ""Liam’s there. Class 2’s heat signatures… close. Yu—copy my quirk. Burn his ice. Makito—stick with Kenta. Heal Class 2.""

He hoisted Makito with his tail, ignoring the healer’s yelp. ""Time to be heroes

Hiroto stared at the shadowy figure clad in a karate gi, its face obscured by the dim light filtering through cracked windows. The voices in his mind hummed like a swarm of wasps, low and commanding: *This is it. A sin. Stay calm. Don’t fight. Convert.* His throat tightened, but he forced his voice steady.

“You must be a sin… well, my name is Hiro—”

The clatter of footsteps interrupted him. Rin burst onto the scene, human again but still panting from his sprint, his golden eyes wide with urgency. Hiroto’s pulse spiked.

*OH MY GOD, YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. DO THESE IDIOTS HAVE A TRACKER ON YOU?!*

*HOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW!!!* Hiroto snapped back internally.

The voices hissed, colder now: *Whatever. You know what to do. The moment is here. CONVERT NOW.*

He exhaled sharply, fleeting images of Class 4’s camaraderie—shared jokes, victories, Rin’s easy grin—flashing behind his eyelids like dying embers.

“Rin. Stand with me,” Hiroto said flatly, though his fists trembled at his sides.

Rin stepped forward, shoulders squared.

In a blur, Hiroto spun and drove a backkick into Rin’s jaw. The impact echoed off the walls as Rin crumpled, clutching his face.

“Sorry for the interruption,” Hiroto said, voice devoid of warmth as he turned back to the figure. “As I was saying… my name is Hiroto Yamazaki.”

Rin staggered upright, blood trickling from his split lip. “What the hell—?”

Hiroto’s front kick slammed into Rin’s stomach, hurling him into the concrete wall. A gasp tore from Rin’s throat.

Seven and Taiyou froze at the stairwell, eyes wide.

*TAKE THEM OUT NOW. KILL, KILL THEM!!!*

Hiroto lunged, fists flying. A double punch sent Seven and Taiyou skidding down the steps.

He turned to Rin, hands shoved in his pockets, face a mask of indifference. Inside, the voices cackled.

*YES, YES HIROTO! GOOD JOB. YOU’RE SO CLOSE. CONVERT!!!*

“The voices inside my head told me to do this,” Hiroto said, tapping his temple. “And I know I made the right choice.”

*YOU’RE DAMN RIGHT YOU DID. WOOOHOO!*

He let the voices’ cheers hang in the air before continuing, tone clinical: “Let me explain. I’m not here to take you or the sins out. I’m here to destroy the heroes. You and I share the same goal. I don’t consider you my enemy… because I’m betraying the heroes. I’ve decided to convert. Embrace the dark side. So I hope you… and the others… will welcome me.”

*FINALLY, YOU DID IT HIROTO. LET’S GOOOOOO! LET’S GET THIS PARTY STARTED.*

Rin groaned, pushing himself up. Hiroto’s gaze locked onto him, eyes glacial.

“Rin… because of you… I had to concede to that *bitch*.” His voice dropped to a venomous whisper. “Do you remember that fight? Do you realize how much I’ve suffered because of you?”

*YES, KILL, KILL THAT BASTARD!*

Hiroto’s fists clenched until his nails drew blood. “I’m going to get my revenge… and then fucking kill you.” He glanced at the figure. “Are you going to stand there and observe… or join me?”

Rintaro wobbled to his feet, glaring at Hiroto’s hollow stare before turning to the figure. “You. What did you do to him? Is it mind control? Turn him back. *Now.*”

He faced Hiroto, pity softening his tone. “I had no idea you felt so strongly about the fight. We’ll settle this once you’re back to your senses. But until then…”

Rin yanked Hiroto closer and smashed his forehead into Hiroto’s nose. He staggered back, wiping blood from his brow, and squinted into the darkness.

“Seven… is that you?” Rin panted, gesturing to the figure. “Deal with him. He must be controlling Hiroto. Food’s on me if you do.” His gaze hardened as he turned to Hiroto. “While you do that… I think I’ll be having a rematch.”

Seven and Taiyou exchanged glances. Taiyou tilted his head, innocently holding up a bread roll. “Wow, your class is full of strange people.”

Seven scoffed. “Tch. You better be of help, Bread Kid.” His six tentacles erupted from his chest, writhing like serpents as he glared at Ryumon. “These guys have their troubles to fix… and I have food to get.”

Taiyou blinked. “I have bread.”

Seven snarled, “Shut up and follow my lead,” before lunging at the figure.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hiroto’s head snapped back from the headbutt, blood trickling from his split lip. He grinned through the pain, teeth stained crimson, and lunged. His fists became a blur—feinting a punch at Rin’s bruised face before driving his knee into the boy’s unprotected stomach. Rin doubled over, gagging, and Hiroto pivoted, a spinning heel kick cracking against his ribs. Rin crumpled, wheezing.

“I *am* in my senses, you stupid animal man,” Hiroto sneered, rolling his shoulders. The voices cackled in his skull, their approval warm and intoxicating. “Why wait? Let’s settle this *now*.”

*‘Okay, guys, let’s do this. It’s showtime!*’ he thought, bouncing lightly on his toes. For the first time in weeks, the ache in his joints was gone, replaced by a buzzing, electric clarity.

*‘GET HIM, HIROTO! SHOW THEM WHAT YOU’RE MADE OF!’*

He dropped into a taekwondo stance, fingers twitching. “Bring it on, animal man. Let’s end this shit.”

Rintaro dragged himself upright, every muscle screaming. His vision swam—Hiroto’s cheap shots had shattered his guard, his ribs, his focus. Blood pooled under his tongue, metallic and thick. *Last time… I beat him. But this isn’t him.*

His nails elongated into claws, canines sharpening as a feral snarl ripped from his throat—but it died halfway. The hyena’s wildness faded from his eyes, leaving only resolve. He let his claws retract, though patches of fur still bristled along his arms.

“I can’t… I *won’t* hurt you again,” Rin panted, swaying. He raised a trembling, half-transformed hand. “I’ll bring you back. *Believe it.*”

Hiroto scoffed, tensing to strike—

A body slammed between them.

Taiyou sprawled on the concrete, blood seeping from his temple. “G-gah…” he choked, fingers scrabbling weakly.

The two froze.

Up the stairs, Ryumon stood motionless. Seven writhed against the wall, impaled not by his own tentacles—but by a pitch-black one that pulsed grotesquely, its surface slick with his blood. Beside Ryumon, a figure stepped forward: tanned skin, green eyes glinting like frost, black hair tousled by an unseen breeze. Indifferent. Hungry.

The black tentacle retracted, slurping back into the stranger’s chest. Seven slumped, gasping.

“I should introduce myself,” the man said, voice smooth as oil. “To my friend’s schoolmates.”

He tilted his head, smiling faintly.

“My name is… Shinji Nakamura.”

**SHINJI NAKAMURA.**  
**SIN OF ENVY.**

Monaco’s wings shuddered as he plucked two sword-feathers from his plumage, their edges glinting like fractured obsidian. Blood seeped from the gashes on his arms, mixing with tears that streaked his pallid face. He stepped forward, each footfall crunching against the frostbitten ground.

“I’m sorry… but you all can’t go any further.” His voice cracked, raw and ragged. “For the sake of the world.”

Hina’s eyes narrowed, her stance coiled like a spring. “I don’t know *who* the fuck you are,” she spat, pacing in tight, predatory circles. “But if you’re a hostage, now’s our chance to get the hell out of here.”

Her boot slammed into the ice, fracturing it. “But if you’re *not*—” She dropped into a fighting stance, knuckles whitening. “—then I won’t show mercy. *Hellhounds*, be careful!”

Liam exhaled slowly, his breath crystallizing in the subzero air. Energy pulsed around him in glowing, accelerating rings. “I suppose I can be considered a hostage,” he drawled, smirking. “But before we discuss that… *hellhounds*? Seriously? That’s corny as hell.”

Hina’s jaw twitched. “You little *bastard*!!! What’s your name… Ryumon? Mugen? *Liam*?” Her eyes widened—*Liam Grace. Terrorism suspect.* She tensed, ready to strike.

“Don’t call me a bastard, ya bastard,” Liam sneered, energy swirling faster. “Be polite and introduce yourselves first.”

“You’re *stalling*, bastard! Thought I wouldn’t know?!” Hina lunged, her body blurring as **DEAL: Agility for Physical** activated. Muscles bulged unnaturally beneath her skin, veins throbbing—a five-second surge before the crash.

Liam flicked his wrist. **\[Absolute Frostbite\]**. The air plunged to -200°C, ice erupting across the floor. He skated backward effortlessly, taunting: “Were you so angered by the hellhound comment? Acting like a hurt little puppy.”

“Why am I so angry…?” Hina snarled, smashing her fists into the ice. **DEAL: Taste for Touch**. Her palms split open, blood sizzling against the frost. “Because. They are my *friends*.” She glanced at Touji, Yuuki, and Nam, her grin feral. “And I may be a little puppy… but at least I’ve got my *pack*!”

“How very touching,” Liam mocked, pirouetting on the ice like a dancer. *That window…*

“Touji!!! Smash this ice!” Hina barked, pointing. “Yuuki, Nam—flank him! *Go!*”

Monaco’s wings flared, stone feathers slicing through the air like shrapnel. “He’s not your problem. Your fight’s with *me*.”

Hina froze. “Monaco? *Why?*” Her voice dropped, venomous. **DEAL: Eye for Ear**. The world muted as she lunged, relying on sight alone.

Monaco recoiled, wings cocooning around him. “I’d say it’s good to see you… but that’d be a lie.”

“Bastard, stop *fucking* talking!” Hina’s fist cracked against his armored feathers. She grinned wildly. “Promise not to go easy on me, motherfucker.”

Monaco crouched, crossing his arms in an X. “It’s a deal, then.”

“By the terms… Monaco Knox won’t go easy on me. In exchange, I gain—”

**“PREZ, GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER!”** Touji barreled past, fists slamming into Monaco’s guard. Ice splintered underfoot.

The trucker—a chain-smoking man with a *Godzilla vs. Megalon* tattoo—had only grunted when they’d climbed into his rig. Forty minutes of stale coffee fumes and staticky radio later, he dumped them.  
  
The truck’s headlights vanished into the rain-soaked Tokyo, leaving Kazuyuki and Ewan shivering under the flickering neon sign of the abandoned hospital. *Tokyo Municipal General*, the letters read, half-eaten by rust. The building loomed like a skeletal hand clawing at the sky, its windows shattered, ivy strangling the walls.

“...This is it, Ewan,” Kazuyuki muttered, his breath a pale ghost in the freezing air.

Ewan nodded, fingers digging into the straps of his backpack. The smell hit them first—antiseptic rot, stale blood, and something sweetly chemical. They stepped over broken glass, their footsteps echoing through corridors lined with rusted gurneys and peeling posters warning of contagion. A single fluorescent light buzzed overhead, flickering like a dying pulse.

***Crunch.***

Ewan froze. Something shifted in the shadows ahead—a skittering, like rats… or scalpel blades dragged across tile. He latched onto Kazuyuki’s arm, his voice a squeak: “D-Did you hear—?”

“He’s here,” Kazuyuki whispered, staring into the dark.

A gleam of light caught glass. First, the reflection: a lab coat, pristine white. Then the man himself.

**Naoki Hakamura** emerged, his smile a crescent moon in the gloom. The jar in his hand sloshed faintly, its black goo writhing like a living thing.

“Kawasaki! *Kid!*” he chimed, voice dripping with paternal warmth. “What brings you here?” His gaze slid to Ewan. “I see you brought a friend.”

Kazuyuki stepped forward, fists clenched. Hakamura tilted his head, the smile never faltering.

“But Kawasaki…” He raised the jar, the goo pressing against the glass as if hungry. “Tell me…” His voice dropped, syrupy and lethal. “…why do you seem… so...”

The goo *thumped*.

***“…Hostile?”***

**HAKAMURA NAOKI.**  
**SIN OF GREED.**

The stairs groaned underfoot, each step exhaling a century’s worth of dust. Loki swiped a hand through the air, but the particles clung like cobwebs, thickening with every breath. Mahito coughed into his sleeve, eyes watering. “The fuck *is* this?” he rasped. “Asbestos? Ghost dandruff?”

Loki didn’t answer. His head swam, the corridor ahead warping as if underwater. The dust wasn’t just dust—it *pulsed*, alive with a faint, sickly shimmer. Mahito staggered, bracing himself against the wall. “Yo… this shit’s laced,” he slurred, squinting at the motes glittering in the dim light. “Like… fucking *fairy poison* or somethin’.”

At the corridor’s end, a figure materialized.

She leaned against a rotted doorframe, her silhouette backlit by a cracked stained-glass window. The gown clung to her like liquid silk, translucent enough to reveal the curve of her hip, the shadow of her collarbone. Her hair cascaded in ink-black waves, framing a face that belonged on a Renaissance canvas—all full lips and heavy-lidded eyes.

**“Loki, dear…”** Her voice was smoke and honey, curling around them. **“You came to see Mommy for yourself?”**

**“Poor thing,”** she purred, reaching to brush dust from Loki’s shoulder. Her nails gleamed venom-green. **“You look… parched.”**

Mahito swatted her hand away. “Save the MILF act. We ain’t here for a wine-and-cuddle sesh.”

Komari’s smile sharpened. **“No?”** She traced a nail down Mahito’s cheek, drawing a bead of blood. **“But you’re** ***exactly*** **my type. All that…** ***anger*****. It’s** ***delicious*****.”**  


**KOMARI ISHIKAWA.**

**CRASH.**

The door exploded inward, smacking Mugen square in the temple. He stumbled, blinking rapidly—and then *grinned*, wild and unhinged.

“**HELL YEAH!**” Mugen whooped, shaking off the hit like a dog shedding water. “TWO ON ONE? *NOW* WE’RE TALKIN’!”

**Martin** (red eyes blazing, flame sword in hand) and **Lam Lee** (braid whipping, single arm coiled) exchanged a glance. *Something’s off.*

Mugen lunged first—not with martial arts precision, but a haymaker aimed at Lam’s jaw. Lam ducked, his braid lashing out like a whip to wrap around Mugen’s wrist.

“You’re *enjoying* this?!” Lam snarled, yanking Mugen off-balance.

“**DUH!**” Mugen laughed, using Lam’s pull to swing himself into a cartwheel kick at Martin. “Fightin’s *FUN*! C’MON, FLAME-BOY—LIGHT ME UP!”

Martin parried with his sword, flames licking Mugen’s shin. Instead of recoiling, Mugen *howled* with glee. “**HOT HOT HOT!**” He ripped a leg off a broken chair, twirling it like a baton. “MY TURN!”

“Why’s he… *laughing*?” Lame hissed, dodging a wild swing.

Lam’s braid snaked around Mugen’s ankle, tripping him mid-charge.   
  
  
“Possession wore off,” Martinrealized. “This is just… *him*.”

ed, his red eyes narrowing. “Wait—*Vin’s gone*? You’re… just *like this*?!”

“**BINGO!**” Mugen lunged, grabbing both their heads and *smashing* them together. “JUST **ME**, MY FISTS, AND YOU DORKS!---- though i can't seem to quite remember what happened.”

Lam spat blood, wiping his mouth. “You’re insane.”

1. AM: At most a water wash and rosehip oil moisturise then makeup straight on.

Every 5 or 6 months I'll do a 30% glycolic acid peel at home which just causes mild flaking for 4 days. 

My skins is clearly dehydrated or my barrier damaged. I didn't know it even really existed or could be damaged.

What would you do?,"We've been together for almost 2 years and recently started talking about moving in together. I like where we are going together as a coupe and I say our relationship has been strong and steady. But something that's been bothering me since day 1 is not getting worked on and I'm tired of bringing it up.

He's always late. He's late to work (his workday is 9-5 but always gets in at 11 at a startup), he's late to flights, and he's late to our dates. A few instances:

\- We were supposed to pick his parents up from the airport one day. I kept checking the traffic because they were arriving around rush hour at the end of a workday and I noticed the time getting longer and longer. Knowing it takes him a while to get ready and actually head out, I figured that 45 min drive to the airport with him spending 15 minutes getting ready, an hour was going to be perfect. I let him know a little over an hour before that we should leave at X time. He said ok I'll get ready. We're 5 minutes into that hour and he was still scrolling on his phone so I said we should leave soon since the traffic is getting crazy and I know how his parents hate waiting. He said ok again and didn't move. After giving him 20 minutes to get ready, he didn't move an inch so I said I'm going to the airport by myself and I'd appreciate it if he'd be ready to go to dinner as soon as we get back. He said 'Noooo baby why are you going by yourself?' and when I explained how I gave him 30 minutes to get ready and head out but he didn't do anything, he blamed his depression (he's never been diagnosed) and said he needs to brainrot to wind down from his long day. His long day? He went to work for lunch and came home right away. He watched TV for a few hours. We got to the airport 2 hours later than we expected to.

\- For my birthday and our anniversary, he made a dinner reservation at a place we both have been dreaming to go to. Without traffic, it's 30 minutes away from where I live but given street parking is needed, I'd say 35-40 minutes. He was going to come pick me up and go to the restaurant together. Dinner was at 8, he left his apartment at 7:45, got to me at 8, and we arrived at 9. The restaurant had a 15 minute grace period and because he did not respond to his texts and calls about the reservation, our table was gone.

\- We were out of town for his friend's wedding. Wedding ceremony was at 4pm and our hotel was 10 minutes away on foot. I told him we should get there around 3:30 to say hi to our friends who also attended the wedding and he said ok let's leave at 3:15. While he was putting his clothes on, he checked his email and found out his favorite brand was having a sale. He didn't move one bit and started browsing the sale. I said we can call a Uber and head to the wedding if he wants to browse the sale to save time. He said no I need to do this now since things are going to be sold out when I have time later. He spent 15 minutes standing in the bathroom browsing the sale, didn't buy 1 shit. When I told him we should head out soon, he said he still needs to finish dressing up and put his shoes on. We left the hotel at 3:40, and halfway to the venue, he said he forgot his tie clip. I said he looks great and I don't think he'd really need it, but he said he needs it and said he's going to run back to the hotel and that I should just go. This was HIS friend's wedding. I said I'd go back with him and we can take a car back so we don't have to walk in a hurry. He said fine let's head back, so we hurried back to the hotel and because he was sweating, he said he needed to shower. I was out of words. I was devastated and disappointed. He eventually was ready to go at 4:30pm. By the time we got to the wedding, the ceremony was over and everyone was gathered around for drinks.

Just this morning, we were supposed to meet up for lunch and go see an apartment together at 2. We chose a lunch place near the apartment opening and were supposed to meet at 1. Instead of 1, I told him we have a reservation at 12:30 so I can just be there at 1 and I don't have to wait. He said he was leaving at 12 and arriving at 12:20 so I hurried and got to the lunch spot right at 12:30. He wasn't there and he didn't leave any messages so I called him to see where he was, and he said he had to get gas and he had to pee so he stopped by at a cafe and couldn't just use the bathroom so he got a cup of coffee and a pastry. He never showed up to lunch. I ate by myself and he came to the apartment showing at 2:30.

He blames him being late on ADHD, depression, and me being pushy with our schedule. But if I don't give him a set schedule to do certain things, he never does it. I feel disrespected, disappointed, and I'm starting to wonder if he values me or my time. I tried to talk to him about this so many times but every single time he said I need to chill and not get uptight with schedules. Sure if it's just the two of us getting coffee that's fine but he's always late to our appointments for apartments, weddings, meeting my parents, and pretty much everything in his life.

I tried to be nice and understand that sometimes people take a while to get mentally and physically ready for things, but maybe I shouldn't have. What would you do?

  
Edit: He once told me during our argument about this, that he's the type of person who'd be late to his own wedding.",1,1737765539.0,relationship_advice,9,0.6,False

Glitch was my #1 favorite 
X coffee was #2 and surprisingly they didn’t have a line or long wait unlike all the other cafes on this list 

Bongen was good too, and I really liked Coffee Swamp pour overs in shinjuku

Glitch was just exceptional. Their award winning beans were 10/10, and also some of their “innovation” beans had such clear flavors that matched the notes advertised. One type was supposed to be buttery, and it tasted undeniably like a strong hint of butter. One was pomegranate / bubble gum and those flavors definitely shined through

I went back 2 more times. Bought beans from glitch and from x cafe ",64,1737765506.0,pourover,7,0.96,False
