About me: early 20s, working in tech in Bangalore. Quiet, low-drama guy who prefers cafes, long walks, lazy Sundays and real conversations over parties and small talk. I tinker with photography, 3D design and tiny web/homelab projects. I spent the last few years building skills and hobbies, so I‚Äôm kinda new to dating and I‚Äôm ready to actually try.

Why I‚Äôm here: I tried the apps and they felt shallow and hookup-heavy. Weekends have been mostly me rotting in bed and scrolling, and I want to change that. Looking for something real, slow build and honest, not casual hookups.

What I‚Äôm like:
Calm and thoughtful, I listen more than I talk  
Loyal and low-drama  
Into one on one stuff: tea/coffee, parks, long walks, late night talks  
Creative and curious, I like building things and learning random skills
New-ish to dating but sincere about it

Looking for:
someone kind, emotionally mature, curious, and into a slow-build vibe. Local to Bangalore is a plus but I‚Äôll chat first if you‚Äôre elsewhere. No hookups, no games.

1mr8w92,https://www.reddit.com/r/FTMventing/comments/1mr8w92/update_trans_coworker_outted_me/,Update: Trans coworker outted me,"Here's the original post: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/FTMventing/s/pbGlPZ7gIC


To summarize, I work in an office as a personal assistant to my boss, Nik. 

A trans woman, let's call her Katie, recently started working here and outed me in front of him and was telling everyone about me being trans. I confronted her after some advice here, and she wasn't receptive. I was debating on outing myself to Nik and explaining the situation so he could make her stop. 

Here's the update - 

Folks told me I should go to HR or my boss. After some debating and getting almost no sleep last night, I went into work a little late, ready to face the possibility that people know I'm trans now. 

Nik wasn't in his office, which was odd, so I started working on my tasks while I waited for him. He came in an hour later and told me to have a seat. Petrified, I was expecting him to reassign me, fire me, or worse! Hate me. 

He told me that Katie came to him this morning and claimed I had cornered her and made her feel very unsafe. He inquired what I did/said, and she told him I was upset she was asking me questions and ""bothering"" me. I explained my side of things and dropped that I was trans. 

Maybe I got a little too emotional because I low-key begged him not to fire me and said that I wasn't lying to him. I am a man. He was very quiet for a few minutes, told me he believed me, and said he was always going to be on my side. The relief!!!! Oh my god!!! 

He then went on about how brave he thought I was and how she was being inappropriate. He took me out to get a coffee after and even bought me a cute cup to go with it. 

In conclusion, I'm ungodly lucky Nik is my boss!! Something about the way he looks at me changed, though, and I'm not sure what it is. It's not bad in the slightest; I like it. 

Anyway! All is well. Im not sure what will happen with Katie but if anyone wants any updates let me know. ",2,1755288673.0,FTMventing,1,1.0,False
1mr8vvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1mr8vvy/evaluate_ge_mwf_refrigerator_water_filter_review/,Evaluate GE MWF Refrigerator Water Filter Review Is It Worth the Investment?,"The **GE MWF Refrigerator Water Filter**, model MWF, promises a lot on paper, and being someone who takes water quality seriously, I put this replacement filter through its paces. It‚Äôs designed to reduce lead, sulfur, and over 50 other impurities, catering directly to those who want cleaner and better-tasting water straight from their refrigerator. Over several weeks of daily usage, I‚Äôve detailed my experience, weighing its strengths and shortcomings.

**Ease of Installation**  
I‚Äôve had my share of frustrations with replacements that require Sherlock Holmes-level detective work just to figure out installation instructions. Thankfully, this doesn't fall into that category. Popping this GE filter into my refrigerator was surprisingly smooth. With no need for special tools or shutting off water lines, installation was a simple twist-and-lock process that took less than five minutes. I wasn‚Äôt prepared for such a hassle-free experience‚Äîit‚Äôs the kind of thing that makes you appreciate good design after fumbling with subpar alternatives in the past.  
[Check GE MWF Refrigerator Water Filter price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b000ast3ak/)

**Filtration Performance**  
When I first tasted the water after installing this filter, there was a noticeable difference compared to my older generic replacement. By reducing contaminants like chlorine-resistant cysts, lead, and certain pharmaceuticals, the water smelled and tasted fresher, without any metallic or chemical aftertaste lingering. Testing it on my family proved the same; even my 10-year-old remarked how it was easier to drink ‚Äúwithout that weird tang.‚Äù It‚Äôs NSF-certified, which contributes to the reliability here. However, if you're looking for advanced filtration of fluoride or ultra-specific contaminants, you might need to pair this with another dedicated filter.

**Certified for Pharmaceuticals**  
Its ability to target pharmaceuticals like ibuprofen or fluoxetine (even though not all water sources have these) makes it seem high-tech. I didn‚Äôt run a lab analysis (not a scientist, remember?), but knowing this feature exists offers peace of mind. For areas with questionable water quality, this could genuinely be a standout.

**Durability and Lifespan**  
One of the appealing aspects is its lifespan. GE recommends replacing it every six months or 300 gallons, whichever comes first, and I‚Äôve hit four months with consistent high flow so far. No noticeable decline in filtration or flow rate yet, even with daily use from coffee-making to filling sports bottles for workouts. But, filters can degrade fast if the water source is overly polluted, so mileage may vary.

**Good Aspects**  
- Installation is quick and tool-free, making it accessible for nearly anyone.  
- Genuine certified filtration guarantees better water quality for improved taste and health.  
- Compatible with various GE side-by-side and bottom-freezer refrigerators.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- It‚Äôs a bit pricier compared to generic filters, although quality and certification justify the expense.  
- Shipment delays for this specific model have been noted by other reviewers, which caught my attention before ordering.  
- No recycling option packaged with it, something environmentally friendly users might miss.

**Competing Products**  
I‚Äôve tested cheaper generic filters before, drawn in by promises of similar performance at lower prices. But here‚Äôs the catch: they don‚Äôt match the NSF certifications that come with this GE filter. Take, for instance, the Amazon Basics filter‚Äîa decent budget choice but less effective at handling lead and cysts (I could taste the chlorine more compared to this filter). On the higher end, a similar offering from Whirlpool boasts additional fluorine removal properties but costs noticeably more per cartridge. This filter hits a sweet spot, outperforming the generics while staying more affordable than niche premium filters.

**Price Performance**  
There‚Äôs no getting around it, quality comes at a price. This filter is more expensive than many competitors, but for good reason. Its certifications, reliable material construction (activated carbon and resins), and ease of use ensure you‚Äôre not just paying for a brand name but genuine filtration quality. For households prioritizing drinking water that‚Äôs both safe and delicious, it‚Äôs worth the moderate splurge compared to uncertified alternatives.

1mr8vd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Bench-Warmer45/comments/1mr8vd1/my_top_2_for_powerbanks_an_in_depth_analysis/,My top 2 for powerbanks: an in- depth analysis,"College student here with an iphone 11. We all know how fast the battery drains with those and in college I barely ever get to come to my room unless I need to sleep so I never get to charge my phone from an outlet during the day. Therefore I very much needed an IN BUDGET power bank so I did my research(really good at that). Mainly went through subreddits and un sponsored youtube reviews to gather my top 5, dropped any that felt like paid reviews. Didnt really read amazon reviews because god they sound really fake. 

I've used like a 100 power banks from the $20 ones to the literal $150 ones and one thing I now know for sure the price tag literally doesn't guarantee anything AT ALL so didn't fall for the big brands this time. Evaluated on very different factors this time around. 

Anyways after analyzing for a good few days I picked my top two:
Mophie powerstation
Statik goHub

Below I'll list each comparison factor along with my description + rating:
Ps I've kept it super short and simple
1. Charging Speed
Mophie: 9/10
Legit fast. Especially through usb-c. Feels like a proper 20W charger, doesn‚Äôt taper off halfway.
Statik: 7/10
Good enough for the size and price. Usb-c performs well, but not crazy fast if you‚Äôre used to flagship level quick charge.
2. Capacity / Battery Life
Mophie: 9/10
20,000mAh. Gives 4+ full phone charges. Works great for travelling.
Statik: 6.5/10
10,000mAh. decent for 1.5 to 2 full phone charges. Best as a daily backup, not a road trip thing.
3. Portability
Mophie: 6.5/10
It‚Äôs slim, but still long and heavy. Won't fit in regular pants.
Statik: 9/10
Super compact. About the size of a card deck, built in cables and plug folds in. Fits in most pockets.
4. Extra Features
Mophie: 7/10
led indicators, good build, multiple ports. Nothing wild, but all done cleanly.
Statik: 9.5/10
Built-in usb-c, lightning and micro-usb cables + wall plug for recharging. Has the battery percentage screen too. Basically a grab-and-go device.
5. Value for Money
Mophie: 8/10
$42. On the pricier side, but if you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs always on the move or works remotely, you‚Äôll get your money‚Äôs worth.
Statik: 9/10
$40. For what it offers like the built-in cables, plug, portability the price is real low. 
Final Verdict:
power + speed + sleek = Mophie
Long hikes or trekking trips
university classes with no charging spots
Full day conferences
Traveling 
Festivals or outdoor events
convenience + portability + no extra wires = Statik 
Daily office bag essential
Short meetings or coffee shop work sessions
weekend getaways
I suck at keeping my phone charged so even though it kinda exceeds my reccs, mophie fits my habits better. If anyone has questions, ask away, ive got all the details literally memorized lol.

1mr8v6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mr8v6p/does_the_oxo_brew_coffee_maker_8710100_review/,Does the OXO Brew Coffee Maker 8710100 Review Reveal Its True Value?,"The OXO 8710100 Brew 9-Cup Coffee Maker swiftly won a spot on my kitchen counter, promising stellar coffee with an elegant look. As someone perpetually chasing the perfect cup and armed with caffeine-induced enthusiasm, I scrutinized every feature. While undeniably impressive, there are nuances to consider if you‚Äôre envisioning your mornings made brighter by this stainless-steel beast.

**Sleek and Modern Design**  
Right out of the box, this coffee maker feels premium. The sleek silver stainless-steel exterior pairs well with its black accents, looking like it belongs in one of those minimalist kitchens you see online. Its dimensions (8.3""D x 15""W x 17.2""H) might make you ponder counter space, but I found it fit snugly, even in my not-so-spacious kitchen, next to my trusty blender. The thermal carafe feels sturdy and high-quality, while the intuitive single dial neatly blends simplicity with functionality. Though it's visually appealing, a fingerprint magnet it most definitely is‚Äîgrabbing a microfiber cloth quickly became part of my coffee ritual.

**Key Features Driving Functionality**  
Let‚Äôs talk about what this drip coffee machine really brings to the table. The BetterBrew Precision Brewing was a feature I was particularly excited about. Supposedly controlling water temperature between 197.6¬∞F ‚Äì 204.8¬∞F (aka the gold range for taste), it ensures consistent results whether brewing just a couple of cups or a full pot. The 9-cup capacity was a boon when the in-laws visited‚Äîthis thing churned out coffee like a caf√© during rush hour! Oh, and the Rainmaker showerhead? It sounded a bit gimmicky in theory, but it genuinely distributes water more evenly over the grounds. My coworkers practically staged tasting sessions comparing the extraction quality to their coffeemakers.

**Pluses**  
- Fully automatic design catered nicely to my ""barely awake at dawn"" self.  
- Set-and-forget programmable timer means I woke up every morning to the smell of freshly brewed coffee.  
- Double-wall stainless steel thermal carafe keeps coffee hot for hours‚Äîa lifesaver for multitaskers like me.  

Check [OXO 8710100 Brew Coffee Maker](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b00yeykk8u/) price on Amazon.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The freshness timer, while handy, seemed redundant for me‚Äîcoffee rarely even spends 20 minutes in the pot.  
- It uses paper filters only, which was a drawback since I usually rely on reusable ones in my bid to be more eco-friendly.  
- The dial, as sleek as it looks, can feel overly sensitive, especially when setting precise time or cups.

**How Does it Perform?**  
Performance-wise, the OXO Brew didn‚Äôt disappoint. The pause-and-pour feature helped me grab a quick cup before the entire carafe was brewed ‚Äì a game-changer. The process felt fast, with no unnecessary temperature fluctuations. My espresso-obsessed cousin claimed the boldness matched her usual brew from a higher-end machine, though maybe not the depth she prefers. Yet, this machine isn‚Äôt exactly about espresso, so that wasn‚Äôt surprising. Switching between different settings became intuitive after a couple of uses, although I do wish there were tactile markers for the visually impaired.

**Good Points**  
- I loved the even flavor consistency across every sip. That internal mixing tube truly came through.  
- The Specialty Coffee Association certification felt like a credibility boost‚Äîsomething that not every home brewer achieves.  
- The combination of automatic systems and precise settings made it newbie-friendly and versatile enough for coffee geeks.

**Negatives**  
- Given its 10.5 lb weight, moving it for deep cleaning or re-arranging my counter was a real chore.  
- It has a 120-volt limit, so forget using it overseas unless you‚Äôve got an adapter handy.  
- For the perfectionist, the lack of grind control or brewing strength adjustment might feel restrictive.  

**Direct Competitors**  
Now, how does this machine stack up against alternatives? My friend‚Äôs Bonavita BV1900TS is often touted as another excellent drip coffee machine. It‚Äôs just as compact and certified by the SCA as well. Still, I found the Bonavita‚Äôs single-button functionality lacking compared to OXO's thoughtful programming options. On the other hand, the Technivorm Moccamaster might challenge OXO Brew‚Äôs crown as the reigning home coffee maker. With its manually adjustable drip-stop, Technivorm edges ahead in control but doesn‚Äôt come near OXO‚Äôs modern aesthetic or automation. Each competitor leaves room for individual preferences‚Äîbut, with a mix of aesthetics and automation, this product strikes a balance.

**Value Proposition**  
It wouldn‚Äôt be fair to ignore the cost factor. This machine falls in the mid-to-premium range of home coffee makers. Considering the features it offers‚Äîthe programmable timers, precise temperature controls, and insulated carafe‚Äîyou‚Äôd be looking at a solid investment that saves you recurring caf√© visits. For someone who treats coffee not just as a beverage but a lifeline (guilty!), it feels pretty worth every cent shelled out. Just don't expect it to outshine a manual coffee brewing experience or competing models that let you adjust grind precision.

1mr8uz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mr8uz1/does_the_kitchenaid_kes8557jp_fully_automatic/,Does the KitchenAid KES8557JP Fully Automatic Espresso Machine Live Up to Reviews?,"The KitchenAid KES8557JP Fully Automatic Espresso Machine has quickly become an integral part of my morning ritual. It‚Äôs a stunning piece of equipment that adds sophistication to my countertop, but let‚Äôs dive deeper into whether this high-end machine lives up to its reputation.

**Stunning Design and Build Quality**

This espresso machine immediately captivates with its sleek ""Juniper"" color and metal-clad construction. It doesn‚Äôt just look premium; it feels sturdy and built to endure years of daily use. Its dimensions (18.5""D x 10.2""W x 14.3""H) allow it to comfortably fit on my kitchen counter without overwhelming the space. The touch-screen and clean button layout make it feel modern, yet user-friendly. Just to test it, I gave it a not-so-gentle nudge, and the 40.4-pound weight ensures it stays firmly in place during operation.

**Convenience Meets Functionality**

This appliance isn‚Äôt just a pretty face‚Äîit‚Äôs loaded with features that make my life easier. The removable 2.2-liter water tank proved impressively convenient; refilling it is a hassle-free process, even after making large batches of coffee for guests. The built-in smart dosing grinder is a game-changer, offering consistent grind quality every single time, which is key for perfect espresso extraction. What really surprised me was how intuitive the fully automatic operation is. I can literally push one button and have a cappuccino waiting in under a minute.

**Highlights**

- Automatic smart dosing technology removes the grind guesswork.
- Built-in milk frother precisely heats and froths milk for cappuccinos and lattes.
- Durable metal construction combines style and resilience.
- Removable hopper makes switching coffee beans effortless.
- Simple touch controls with over 20 recipe options.

[Check KitchenAid KES8557JP price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0ctczmvfz/)

**Performance and Beverage Quality**

Here‚Äôs the part that matters most: taste. Can this machine replicate a caf√©-level espresso at home? The short answer is yes‚Äîwith room for a couple of tweaks depending on your preferences. My lattes came out frothy with just the right milk texture, while the espresso shots had a rich crema layer every time. What really sold me was the ability to tweak the strength, temperature, and length individually, allowing me to discover my perfect Americano recipe. However, the machine can occasionally overheat milk slightly if not monitored.

**Ease of Cleaning**

Cleaning espresso machines can be a chore, but KitchenAid simplifies the process with features like the removable milk hose and auto-clean function. The cleaning tablets for the brew unit worked like a charm, and I appreciated that two tablets were included right in the package. Still, disassembling components, especially the bean grinder for deeper cleaning, requires some patience.

**Drawbacks**

- The machine‚Äôs weight makes it difficult to move for deep cleaning.
- The grinder, while consistent, can be slightly noisy during operation.
- It‚Äôs not the fastest machine if you‚Äôre in a morning rush.

**Competing Products**

The KitchenAid KES8557JP competes in a crowded market against brands like Breville and De‚ÄôLonghi. Comparing it to the Breville Barista Pro, for example, the KitchenAid is easier for beginners but doesn‚Äôt quite match the Barista Pro‚Äôs manual control range for advanced users. It also lacks the space-saving footprint of compact models like the Jura ENA 4. However, it clearly shines in its durability and ability to handle various drink recipes with minimal user effort. For those seeking a balance between ease of use and high-quality drinks, this option still stands tall.

**Budget-Friendly or Overpriced?**

When stacked against its features, this product offers excellent **bang for the buck**. Yes, it leans toward the premium price spectrum, but considering it combines an espresso machine, built-in grinder, and automatic milk frother, the costs are justified. Investing in this machine effectively replaces frequent trips to the local caf√©, and over time, the savings do add up. That said, if you‚Äôre someone who only drinks espresso occasionally, a more basic model might suit your needs better.

And with all the self awareness of the terminally ill, he knew this and I did too. He cried as I slept beside him. And I wondered why only some of us are allowed to be alive.

I cook dinner and you joke that you will be dead before the age of 36, and I can't help thinking that I will remember this moment for a very long time.

Can I opt to take the test with an automatic and is that something I provide the car or does the driving test place have their own vehicles. Also if I end up wanting to learn manual can I get a license friend to teach me while I have my US license and also if not what does paying for driving classes look like and what is the best option in the country? 

2. I‚Äôm trying to learn the language rapidly. I‚Äôm currently watching the news, listening to the radio, going to events where I can just listen to the language and also using it at work and at stores as much as possible. I‚Äôve been tempted to take the 20 hour class option in Torshavn but from the website it may be more basic than where I‚Äôm at but was curious if anyone has found that class helpful if they have gone through that. üòÜ I do live life mostly in the present because speaking in the past tense is a bit challenging. 

3. Meals? I‚Äôm normally not a bread person but it seems like I‚Äôm going to have to become one with how much bread I‚Äôve eaten at people‚Äôs houses, at work, and at the place I‚Äôm staying. I‚Äôve tried a few dishes familiar to me but they all come out to be quite expensive here as I guess they are considered specialty items on these islands. I‚Äôve been perusing stores and trying to figure out what are the cheap and healthy combos but any insight to accelerate that would be very much appreciated. Also a bonus tip is when there is whale collected how does that work and how do they notify you of where to pick up a portion. 

4. I hope to get a bus card next week to more affordable explore the islands and get more hiking in and also a library card if possible. I have not done any research yet but understand people living here get some type of discount for the bus. I learned the interesting way that you really should let the bus driver know when you get on if you are going to transfer because they can call ahead and have the other bus wait. It lead to a lovely walk in Runavik though so not much of a loss. 

5. Cultural norms? It seems normal to just swing by and say hi to people you know. I‚Äôve had a few  people knock at my door that I know just to say hey. Is it generally always ok to just show up to peoples houses you know and see if they are home? Are there any unspoken rules in regard to this? In the US you‚Äôd lose a friendship pretty quickly if you just showed up unannounced so trying to figure out here what is ok and not ok. Should I be making coffee/Tea and providing snacks at the bare minimum? 

I‚Äôve noticed people don‚Äôt seem to talk negatively about partners or spouses which i very much appreciate. Are there any other subtle cultural things i should be aware of as not to offend or confuse someone? 


Thanks again for all your help and hopefully by September I‚Äôm more integrated and will be less confused with all the new things to learn about living here.

We've been together about 6 months, all in the happy lovey stages still but the other day I saw a message notification on his phone from his parents that mentioned ""OP doesn't know?"" And that obviously got my brain whirring. 

So, whilst he slept, I looked through his phone. And I know it's wrong to do that but I've been shit on too many times and I have young kids so I need to be certain before introducing this man to them. 

Anyway, I guess FAFO rules apply here because in checking his messages, I saw some with a woman (40s) who he told me was only a friend (although he admitted they hooked up once years ago) and it seems like she thinks they were in a relationship for the best part of 3 years. In itself, it wouldn't bother me if he was in a relationship with her prior to me but I don't know why he wouldn't tell me.

My main issue here is how to move forward. We already had a disagreement before regarding her because the fact that they slept together once wasn't told straight up - it fell out a couple months later. He since agreed that if he saw her or hung out with her, he would tell me and that she wouldn't be allowed to crash at his place anymore (she had done a few times in the past apparently). 

He also asked her yesterday about meeting for coffee soon but didn't say anything to me even though we were together all day.

The one swinging for the fences for me in a rigged game‚Ä¶

But here‚Äôs what I didn‚Äôt fully understand until it was almost too late: family court is basically a small town. Everyone knows everyone‚Ä¶your lawyer, her lawyer, the judges + clerks‚Ä¶they‚Äôve been running into each other for years. They chat in the hallways, share coffee, and chat about each other‚Äôs cases each week.

You‚Äôre not just looking to hire a lone gunman who will scorch the earth for you‚Ä¶you‚Äôre hiring someone who has to walk back into that courthouse next Monday,  and the Monday after that‚Ä¶their relationships there transcend + outlast your case. 

So ‚Äústrong‚Äù moves get softened, deadlines might slide‚Ä¶everything gets packaged as ‚Äústrategy.‚Äù And while you‚Äôre patiently trusting the process, the other side is building an actual record‚Ä¶stacking affidavits, quietly shaping the ‚Äústatus quo‚Äù and turning every weekend without your kid into proof you must not need that time‚Ä¶

The court doesn‚Äôt reward patience‚Ä¶it rewards your presence. And your lawyer‚Äôs incentives aren‚Äôt the same as yours, so when the case ends, your lawyer moves on, and your the one having to live with the outcome...

Me and my mother were preparing to go to a friend's house. I asked if someone else was coming with. Mother said no, then asked me why. I told her I was just curious. She asked me ""Why"" 2 or 3 times, so I spoke up so she could hear me. Now, here's the weird part. Mother took this as attitude. She questioned me why I gave her attitude. Now, I hadn't realized that I had given her any attitude, if I even did in the first place, but in my panic, since I assumed she was correct, I claimed that it was because she gave me attitude, because I had noticed slight annoyance in her tone. I don't know why I said that, I just blanked and panicked. Anyway, she got upset, I forgot what exactly happened, but I went to my room, because I didn't want to deal with this BS, if she's going to yell at me over me speaking up so she could hear me. She burst into my room, saying ""COME ON!"", and somehow, she spilled her coffee. She got even more upset, threw the (Hopefully) empty cup into my room, then started throwing cans, boxes, and one of the boxes she threw had some cans and other stuff in it, which ended up hitting our dog. Mother kept saying ""YOU WANT TO SEE ME GIVING ATTITUDE!?!"", and kept throwing stuff and yelling, so I just went outside and into a friend's car. Mom joined me after a few minutes, and while we were on the road, she kept questioning me about stuff, I forgot what exactly, but it's not important in the sense that this event lead to other conflict. A few minutes after we arrived at a friend's house, the friend we were visiting came up to me, confronting me, saying that I'm the child, so I can't give attitude, that my mother is allowed to give me attitude, and it's my responsibility to learn from it. I tried to defend myself, but he kept shutting me down. I'm feeling super gaslit, and I want to believe I'm in the right, but maybe I'm so blinded, that I'm missing something?

Sunday nights kill me. Just thinking about Monday meetings drains 20% of my energy before anything even happens. Small talk with the grocery store clerk, answering work slack messages, even hearing my neighbor's TV through the wall - it all adds up way faster than I realized. But coffee with my best friend?

Doesn't matter if it's fun or not. Now I plan around this stuff instead of just hoping I'll magically have energy. I feel way less broken and way more like someone who just operates differently.

**The Lobby**

If you‚Äôve never been haunted by a skeleton before, you probably think it‚Äôs the bones that are the problem. It‚Äôs not.

It‚Äôs what‚Äôs still hanging around them.

The first time I saw Uncle Neighbor, he wasn‚Äôt a whole skeleton. Just two arms. The bones were bleached white, gummy with the decayed lacquer coating that once preserved them, every finger wired neatly to a thin steel rod. Being just arms, they made me feel‚Ä¶ lonely for them. They were posed unceremoniously on the coffee table in the center of my apartment building‚Äôs lobby, of which I already have major problems with aesthetically.  For one thing, this post-modern coffee table surrounded by black leather uncomfortably-low-seated chairs, was the unspoken ‚Äúsharing-table‚Äù of the building. Whenever someone had items that were too good to throw out but not enough to keep, they were put onto this table. At least until someone claimed them, or Jerry the maintenance man threw them out with a begrudging huff. Aside from the fact they were on this sharing table, I also knew they were no new addition to the abhorrent decor due to the sign attached to them. It was almost too small to notice.

A crooked, tiny corner of torn cardboard leaned against them; the words scrawled in thick cursive black Sharpie: *Free to a good home.*

It was so absurd, I laughed. It looked like something out of a horror movie‚Äôs opening scene ‚Äî the moment before the idiot protagonist touches the cursed object and the audience groans, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take it home.‚Äù But me, having my spooky bitch credentials, thought myself above such narratives, and gleefully gathered the skeletal arms up into my own be-fleshed ones. Grinning like a demon, I punched the elevator button repeatedly and waited to take my new treasures up to the 7^(th) floor where I lived.

Looking back now, I realize there was an immediate sign to leave them behind. But, I ignored my gut like a fool. You see, my apartment building is‚Ä¶ odd. The strange design choices go far beyond the horrible aesthetics of the lobby. The very bones of this place are bizarre. According to Jerry, in the 1980‚Äôs, it was a popular boutique hotel before it was repurposed as overpriced housing. Each and every apartment in this building has a different layout. Some of them have little foyers through their front doors that lead directly into a half flight of stairs up into the rest of the home. Others have the same but with half flights down into the unit‚Äôs living room, some, like my apartment, have no foyer at all. It is apparently for this reason that our building *only* has odd numbered floors. Basement, Lobby, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13. There are only odd numbered buttons in the elevator. But as I waited for the lift to pick me up from the badly decorated lobby with my new, beloved (albeit odd) treasures, I saw it‚Ä¶ As the elevator made its way down from the 9^(th) floor, I excitedly watched the digital numbers descend, and between 7 and 5, it happened, if only for a moment, a millisecond. I thought maybe I was just seeing things. But looking back, I am positive, I saw it flicker a digital 6, a few times. Three times, actually. Just a quick flutter. Of course, I immediately wrote it off as my overactive imagination, or at the very most, a simple glitch in the old elevator‚Äôs system.

When the elevator doors opened, the woman who lived two doors down from me, I don‚Äôt know her name and always forget to ask ‚Äî my neighbor ‚Äî was standing inside, her eyes immediately fell to the items in my clutches, and they widened. I began to speak defensively, as she seemed like a much more‚Ä¶ normal? Woman than myself. But she quickly fanned away my anxiety with a perfectly manicured hand as she explained, rather matter-of-factly, that they‚Äôd belonged to her uncle. At first, I was intrigued and smiled, ‚ÄúOh was he a professor or something?‚Äù

Stupid. She shook her head slowly, lowering her gaze to look up into my eyes through her thick eyelashes.

‚ÄúNo, not *his* like he bought them. His like they are, or *were*, his.‚Äù It took every shred of self-control I had to keep myself from allowing my mouth to spread into the maniacal grin I felt fluttering in my chest. *Fucking jackpot*, I thought.

She went on to explain further. He‚Äôd donated his body to science decades ago. Back before schools switched to fake plastic skeletons, real human ones like him were a normal sight in anatomy classes.

Her uncle had spent decades in a high school biology lab, crucified to a rolling stand in the corner, chalk dust collecting in his joints while bored teenagers spun him around to make him ‚Äúwave‚Äù a few times a year. She said he‚Äôd been ‚Äúretired‚Äù when the school decided it was time to modernize ‚Äî which meant shipping him back to his family. But apparently whoever shipped him thought it wasn‚Äôt barbaric to ship him in pieces.

Yes, pieces.

When I asked if she was serious, she told me they‚Äôd sent all of him, in several small boxes, over several months, but it was only his arms that made it back to her family. When I asked why she was getting rid of them, her gaze darkened, and it was clear she was choosing her words carefully. She herself is a scientist and is not one for ghost stories, but she did not have a good relationship with her uncle when he was alive. And she explained that the thought of him ‚Äúliving‚Äù with her made her feel uncomfortable.

So, she decided the arms had to go. Fair enough.

She brought them downstairs, wrote the cardboard sign, and left them in the lobby for anyone to take.

Anyone like me.

I don‚Äôt know what I was thinking ‚Äî My morbid curiosity got the better of me the *second* I recognized them as real bones. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt thinking at all. But I picked them up. They weren‚Äôt heavy, just awkward, the metal rods and sharp curling springs cold against my hands. And yet, I swear, there was a strange warmth lingering in the bones themselves, like they‚Äôd been sitting in the sun before being momentarily stuck in a freezer. It was the oddest thing.

My husband didn‚Äôt even get a chance to argue. By the time he saw them, they were already on two shelves in our living room, I positioned the arms spread around the knick knacks, picture frames, and books each shared its new home with.

I told myself it was fine. They were just bones. Just history. Just some guy.

That was my first mistake.

The second mistake was talking to him.

**The First Knock**

For the first week, nothing happened. As I‚Äôd come to enjoy their presence, proud of my strange loot, it took an unfortunate amount of time for it to dawn on me that perhaps it wasn‚Äôt a *great* idea to have the remains of a stranger in my home. So just to be what I considered at the time to be, *safe*, I started talking to them. When I felt an instinctual twinge of dread to look over my shoulder while watching TV, whilst the arms were tucked onto the shelves above and behind me, outstretched like a hug obstructed by books and family photos, I said aloud, like an idiot, ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôll be happy here. I want you to know that you have a home with me wherever I go, and that I will always appreciate your company *and* the sacrifice you made for the sake of others‚Äô education. Very noble, good sir.‚Äù I paused. ‚ÄúI wish I knew your name, but, I don‚Äôt even know your niece‚Äôs name, to be fair.‚Äù I tapped by chin ‚Äú‚Ä¶ my neighbor‚Äôs uncle. Perfect! I dub thee, Uncle Neighbor.‚Äù I grinned to myself wildly, thinking myself so cute and clever.

The arms just sat there on the shelves in our living room, positioned so they leaned slightly back on their elbows, palms draped forward idly. They‚Äôd been wired to steel rods, which kept them in a kind of eternal waiting pose ‚Äî fingers curled ever so slightly, like they were ready to drum on the Ikea shelving at the first sign of boredom.

We didn‚Äôt hide them when guests came over. Why would we? They were great conversation starters. People always noticed them the moment they walked in. Some laughed nervously. Others stared too long, like they were trying to decide whether they were supposed to be amused or regretful about their choice of friends.

One friend wrinkled his nose and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre *so* going to regret that.‚Äù

I just laughed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, dude. Uncle Neighbor and I have an understanding. I protect his spirit with my hospitality, and he protects our home with his ghostly powers. I won‚Äôt regret it, you baby.‚Äù

And I didn‚Äôt. Not yet.

It was‚Ä¶ kitschy, in a macabre way, you know. They fit seamlessly with the rest of our d√©cor. Unlike the lobby, I have an eye for interior design. But again, I have spooky bitch credentials, so the arms matched the rest of our apartment befitted with old leather-bound books, a dark earthy palette, animal bones, and disturbing paintings. They fit in perfectly here. A little grotesque, sure, but the story made it charming: my neighbor had inherited them from her uncle ‚Äî *Uncle Neighbor* as I started calling him ‚Äî who‚Äôd donated his skeleton to science, then somehow ended up partially returned. The arms were all that made it home, and now they have found a home with me. Fun, right? No harm done, right?

That‚Äôs all they were at first. Just bones with a sweet, odd history.

Then‚Ä¶ came the first knock.

It was late ‚Äî after 1 a.m., and I was half-asleep on the couch, husband already in bed in the other room. That is when I heard it: three, slow, deliberate knocks. A pause. Then there were three more.

Not a friendly *tap-tap-tap*, not a ‚ÄúShave and a Haircut,‚Äù but a rhythm with weight to it. A rhythm someone meant you to notice.

My eyes widened, instantly terrified and a little confused. I am a millennial, after all, and am not accustomed to people coming to the front door without alerting me digitally first. I checked my phone ‚Äì No delivery notifications, nor texts from friends who randomly decided to drop by.

In my jammies, I got out from under the throw blanket and silently padded over to the door. I slowly pressed my eye to the peephole, heart pounding, face flushed. The hallway was empty save the ugly sconce on the wall beside the exterior of our front door, whose harsh white light had been flickering eerily for weeks.

Weird, but not terrifying. The acoustics in these hallways could be strange; maybe it came from somewhere else on our floor.

The next night, it happened again. Same pattern. Same pause. Same nothing when I looked. I had convinced myself it was a trick of the echoing hallways and must just be someone else on the floor that is being bothered consistently late.

By the third night, I was telling myself there had to be some neighbor with rude friends. Annoying, a little obnoxious, but not dangerous.

But by the fourth, I was on edge. The knock came, and this time I didn‚Äôt wait ‚Äî I yanked the door open mid-rhythm.

The hallway was empty. The light beside our door buzzed and flickered. Silence.

¬†But when I turned back inside to face the couch and the shelves, illuminated by nothing but the television‚Ä¶ the arms‚Ä¶ they weren‚Äôt on the shelves anymore.

My eyes pricked with tears of confusion and fear, maybe even a little anger, assuming almost immediately that my husband must have been messing with me all this time, a punishment for my willful insomnia. As I began marching back toward the bedroom to shake him awake and give him an earful, I saw them. They were sitting upright against the right side of the front door‚Äôs frame, palms flat on the floorboards, elbows slightly bent. Like they‚Äôd been waiting in the exact place the knocks had been coming from, where I wouldn‚Äôt be able to see them once the door was opened.

I laughed ‚Äî because what else do you do when you catch your own imagination running away with you? I looked to the bedroom down the hall where my husband slept. ‚ÄúHaha, very funny, you got me, you turd.‚Äù I whispered to myself, a wry smile on my face out of respect for my husband‚Äôs brilliant prank.

The next morning as we walked to the gym together, I explained that the jig was up and that I discovered the modem operandi of his little ongoing ghostly knock-knock joke. But his expression wasn‚Äôt amused. He stopped mid stride, looking at me seriously, brows pierced. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt touch them,‚Äù he said, tone clipped, serious as a heart attack.

We argued briefly, first me becoming irritated that he was taking it further, then about whether they‚Äôd been moved when we last dusted the shelves. Upon returning from our workout, we decided to just put them back and move on.

But the next morning, I noticed something new.

The scratches.

Not random scuffs from cleaning, but lightened lines of scuffs, *grooves* carved into the layered, cheap white paint on the door, right at the height where the fingertips had been placed upon my discovery of the eerily relocated arms. Long, parallel lines, dragged down with enough force to coil the scraped off paint into ribbon-like curls.

That night, another new development. A *worse* development.

That night, the footsteps began. Slow, steady, measured ‚Äî pacing in the 7^(th) floor hallway, stopping right outside our front door.

We tried opening the door mid-step, but every time, there was nothing but the dim-lit stretch of empty hall, and that ugly flickering light.

Both of us, without admitting it aloud, began to believe the same impossible thing: Uncle Neighbor wasn‚Äôt just sitting there. He was‚Ä¶ active.

I should have been afraid. Any reasonable person would have been. Or at least a little perplexed.

But I wasn‚Äôt.

I told myself maybe he was keeping watch. Maybe, if I acknowledged him, respected him, appreciated him, it would keep him from getting restless. So, I started speaking to him in the quiet moments beyond the lone previous conversation where I named him Uncle Neighbor. Little things, like, ‚ÄúThanks for keeping an eye on us,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe appreciate you,‚Äù and when I felt really creeped out seemingly out of nowhere, ‚ÄúI am sure this old, weird building is infested with angry ghosts, thanks for protecting us from them, Uncle Neighbor.‚Äù

For a long time, months really, the knocking stopped.

And I thought maybe, just maybe, we‚Äôd struck some strange kind of balance, an agreement, or a symbiotic relationship of sorts.

**Through the Walls**

After the dreams started, I assumed things might get worse in ways to be expected.  
More scratches on the door. More footsteps in the hall. More late-night knocking.

Instead, it went quiet. Too quiet.

I kept waiting for the sound of the knocks, for the pacing footsteps outside, for the sight of the arms somewhere they shouldn‚Äôt be. But days passed with‚Ä¶ nothing.  
The arms stayed exactly where we put them, still and almost polite, like new roommates who had finally taken the hint.

I think that was when my husband decided the whole thing was over.  
He didn‚Äôt say it outright, but the comfortability and smug way he moved around the apartment said plenty. The arms were just a creepy knickknack again. Just a fun icebreaker. The weird noises were probably old pipes. Lord knows our building has plenty of them.

Then came the tapping.

At first, it was so faint I thought it might be in my head. Three sharp clicks. Pause. Three more. Almost‚Ä¶ polite.  
But it wasn‚Äôt coming from the door.

It was inside the wall.

The first night it happened, I sat up and turned toward the sound. My husband was still scrolling on his phone, not even looking up.  
""You hear that?"" I asked.

He paused.  
""Nope,"" he said, without conviction.

The tapping happened again. Louder this time. Moving ‚Äî from one end of the room to the other, following the line of the wall like something was crawling inside it.  
He kept his eyes on his phone.

Over the next few nights, the tapping got bolder.  
Sometimes it came from the bedroom wall while we were brushing our teeth. Other times it started in the kitchen and made its way toward the living room, passing right behind us as we sat on the couch.  
We‚Äôd both freeze when it started, pretending to be deep in conversation or concentrating on the TV.

The rhythm changed, too. At first, it was the same deliberate pattern as the knocks on the door. But then it became impatient. Sharper. Like it was trying to get our attention faster.

Once, I pressed my ear to the wall.  
For a second, there was nothing.  
Then ‚Äî a slow, deep inhale.

I stumbled back, heart hammering. My husband laughed when I told him, but it wasn‚Äôt the kind of laugh that meant he thought it was funny. It was the kind people do when they‚Äôre trying to bury their own unease.

The arms didn‚Äôt move during any of this. They stayed perfectly still on their shelf. Watching. Waiting.  
That was worse somehow ‚Äî like they weren‚Äôt involved at all. Like whatever was in the walls was *something else*.

¬†

One night, the tapping came from inside the headboard.

Not the wall behind it ‚Äî *inside* the wood.

It was almost three in the morning. I woke to the sound of my husband‚Äôs breathing, deep and even beside me. At first I thought it was just a dream remnant ‚Äî until the bedframe shivered slightly.  
The tapping was so close I could feel it through the pillow.

I held my breath. My heart was going so fast I thought the thing inside the wood could probably hear it.

The tapping stopped.

Then the mattress dipped.

Not on my side. His.

His breathing hitched, sharp and sudden, and I knew without looking that he was awake.  
We didn‚Äôt move for what felt like a full minute.  
And then, at the exact same time, we both turned our heads toward the bedroom door.

It was open.

And the faint blue light from the living room spilled across the floor just enough to show the shape of something. Well. Two somethings.

¬†

The arms were no longer on the shelf.

They were pressed flat against the wall above our bed, elbows bent, palms spread wide like they were listening through the plaster.

For a heartbeat, I thought that was all.

Then I saw it.

A shadow stretching up and out from behind them ‚Äî not connected to their bones, but moving with them. A shape that shifted when the arms shifted, bending and stretching in ways that didn‚Äôt match the angle of the light.

The longer I looked, the more it felt like the shadow was watching me back.

It was then‚Ä¶ he started intruding upon my dreams.

**The Dreams**

It was always the same.

I‚Äôd wake in the dark, paralyzed, cold and clammy as death, like my blood had frozen inside me. The air would feel heavy, like a thick velvet weight pressing down on my chest. Then I‚Äôd hear it ‚Äî the slow, deliberate scrape of bone against hardwood. A sound too dry, too hollow to be anything living.

And then they‚Äôd appear. Just the arms ‚Äî pale, bleached white, gummy with that nasty deteriorating lacquer ‚Äî climbing up the side of the bed like some patient predator. Not rushing. Never rushing. Their fingers curled and flexed with each inch gained, joints clicking and springs straining faintly in the stillness.

When they finally reached me, they‚Äôd rest their hands platonically on my chest. Not crushing, but with a weight that pressed just hard enough as if to say, *Don‚Äôt forget I‚Äôm here.* I‚Äôd stare at them, willing myself to wake up fully, to move, to scream ‚Äî anything. But my body wouldn‚Äôt listen.

I told myself it was sleep paralysis. That the mind could do cruel things in the dark. I clung to that explanation for my sanity. And after a while, it worked. I accepted this unfortunate new development in my sleeping issues and adjusted. It sucked but it was fine. I was fine. That is, until the morning I awoke with perfect, large, deep-purple bruises along my collarbone. Finger-shaped and skeletal.

I showed them to my husband over breakfast. He glanced up from his coffee, slowly put down his phone, frowned, and said, ‚ÄúYou must‚Äôve rolled onto your arm and bruised yourself in your sleep.‚Äù I lowered my hand from my chest and began mindlessly picking my thumbs with my index fingers, the way I always did when anxious and lost in my mind. I told him that wasn‚Äôt possible, that the bruises matched the hands exactly, he gave me this careful look ‚Äî the kind you give someone you‚Äôre afraid might start crying or yelling ‚Äî and just said, ‚ÄúMm-hm.‚Äù His eye fell to my hands, ‚ÄúStop picking your thumbs! You‚Äôre making yourself bleed, Jesus.‚Äù He was always so good about keeping tabs on my self destructive behaviors.

That was the first time I noticed the shift in his eyes. The way he was starting to measure my words. Unfortunately, it was a look I was familiar with due to some painful parts of my past, it was the look someone gave you when they thought you were losing your mind. It was an accidental look, but a cruel one all the same. But the symptoms only worsened. Because after that, the arms stopped being content to haunt me only in dreams. Conveniently whenever my husband was away at work, and myself, home alone, as I work remotely, Uncle Neighbor would become‚Ä¶ *active*. The arms would move when I wasn‚Äôt looking. I‚Äôd leave them on their display shelves ‚Äî the ones I had always kept them on, go work on my computer at my desk in our bedroom ‚Äî and come back to find them in the kitchen, or on the bathroom counter, fingertips curled over the porcelain sink like the rest of him might be bent over to look in the mirror, had he the rest of himself.

Once, I found them pressed against the inside of the front door. Elbows bent, palms flat, as if holding something out. It wasn‚Äôt until much later that it occurred to me that he might be holding some*one* in.

Every time we tried to move them back, something happened. The toaster caught fire while we were both in the living room, neither of us had used the thing in days. My husband tripped on the rug hard enough to sprain his wrist. Our cats, *both* of our cats, vanished for two days and returned thinner, the fur of their once long beautiful coats standing on end and singed as if electrified. They‚Äôre both indoor cats We have 650 square feet and no patio. There is nowhere for them to have disappeared to!

So, we stopped trying.

My husband grew quieter about it. I think he thought that if he didn‚Äôt feed the conversation, the whole thing would just fade away. But sometimes I‚Äôd catch him staring at the arms when he thought I wasn‚Äôt looking. We didn‚Äôt talk about it, but we both noticed the way their position began to shift over the course of hours instead of days.

Then, one night, *he* had the dream.

The one where he‚Äôd seen that the arms weren‚Äôt bare bone, but covered in rotting skin, where Uncle Neighbor‚Äôs incorporeal body dragged behind them like a shadow with weight.  
But I‚Äôd seen my husband‚Äôs face when he sat up abruptly in bed.

I woke to the sound of his breath ‚Äî fast, shallow, ragged. His hands clutched the blanket like he was bracing himself against something invisible. I touched his shoulder, and his skin was slick with cold sweat. His eyes snapped open as he snapped up in bed, and for a moment I thought he was going to tell me I‚Äôd been right all along.

Instead, he said, ‚ÄúYou put something in my food, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù And tried to smirk away his own fear. He‚Äôd grown up having sleep paralysis. So maybe it was different for him. He was better practiced at telling himself it wasn‚Äôt real.¬† So, I laughed ‚Äî a sharp, wrong sound ‚Äî because the truth was too heavy to lift just then. But my husband didn‚Äôt laugh with me. We both knew this conversation was a lie.

Over the following weeks, he stopped going in to work. Opting to work from home as much as he could and calling in sick when they wanted him to come in. He wasn‚Äôt sleeping. He couldn‚Äôt function. After a while, he apologized for acting like he didn‚Äôt believe me, to which of course I forgave him, as this entire situation was beyond batshit and we were losing a little more sanity with each lost night of rest. Once he stopped accusing me and saw how ridiculous that was, he started avoiding the subject entirely. In fact, he stopped talking altogether. But I hadn‚Äôt the energy to press him either. We were both so tired all the time.

Something changed in my husband after he lost his job.

¬†His sleep managed to get even worse, and he quickly became skin and bones. He hadn‚Äôt spoken a word in days. Finally, having had enough, he suddenly tore the arms down from their shelves, sending picture frames shattering to the ground and old books bouncing onto the couch. I knew what he was thinking, and I knew it would only exacerbate our torment.

I screamed in hysterical protest, I clung to my husband, trying to keep him and the arms inside, but I was too weak to stop him, and too braindead to explain. Without a word, he went down to the hall to the trash shoot, and tossed the arms in. I heard them clank and screech against the rusted metal shoot down to the basement dumpster.

If there was one thing I *did* know from having my spooky bitch credentials prior to this cavalcade of bad choices, it was that throwing away or trying to destroy haunted items *always* ends badly.

The next morning, while we were sitting in that pale morning light and the tired silence that descended over us like a noxious fog, we sat for breakfast. Which at this point was insanely strong coffee and cold uneaten eggs. My husband finally spoke. His voice was quieter than I‚Äôd ever heard it before. I could not even understand him at first.

‚ÄúI saw him.‚Äù

My eyes widened at the surprise of my husband attempting to speak at all.

‚ÄúWhat, sweetheart? What‚Äôd you say?‚Äù

‚ÄúI. Saw. Him.‚Äù He annunciated.

My eye pricked with tears and my throat tightened painfully.

I didn‚Äôt have to ask who. Though, I never thought I‚Äôd hear my husband admit to this.

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt a dream. And. It wasn‚Äôt just the arms,‚Äù he continued, eyes fixed on his coffee as mine managed to open even wider in questioning terror.

¬†‚ÄúThey were‚Ä¶ covered. Skin hanging in strips. The fingers‚Ä¶swollen, nails cracked. Behind them‚Äî‚Äù He stopped, pressing his lips together, inhaling deep through his nostrils as his empty, staring eyes filled with tears. He continued, his voice a ragged whisper, ‚ÄúBehind them was the rest of him. The rest of *Uncle Neighbor*. But not‚Ä¶ complete. Like the arms were dragging him, and the rest of him‚Ä¶ his body‚Ä¶ was‚Ä¶ stuck somewhere else. Not completely here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWas he looking at you?‚Äù I asked after a measure of silence.

My husband nodded slowly. ‚ÄúLike I‚Äôd done something to him. I‚Ä¶ I shouldn‚Äôt have thrown him aw‚Äî‚Äù He broke down. Big wet tears escaped his eyes, vanishing into his once beautiful beard, now unkempt below his sunken cheeks.

After that morning, we took sleep where we could. Our brains had gone to soup from sleep deprivation. I doubted I would be able to hold onto my job much longer either. When we *were* able to sleep at night, my husband started waking up at the same time that I did. Sometimes before me. We didn‚Äôt talk about it, but I could tell from the way his eyes would dart to the corners of the room upon first waking that he was looking for them ‚Äî the arms ‚Äî even in daylight when he‚Äôd snap awake from naps.

As expected, due to my husband‚Äôs attempt to abandon the arms, things became unbearable. Uncle Neighbor‚Äôs movements became bolder. We‚Äôd hear soft taps from our hallway outside our bedroom, then find the pale boney fingertips of one of the arms curled under the bottom of our closed bedroom door, the other up off the ground, grasping the exterior bedroom doorknob. I once saw them from the corner of my eye in the darkened living room, TV throwing fast shadows over the fingertips as they slid along the wall like a blind man feeling his way toward the sound of a voice.

And then, one night, I awoke to something new.

Not the scrape. Not the weight on my chest.

*Breathing*.

Not from me. Not from my husband. It was shallow, rasping ‚Äî and it was coming from the floor at the foot of the bed. I didn‚Äôt move. Neither did my husband, whom I could feel awake beside me. In the faint glow my computer screen on my desk cast weakly across the bedroom‚Ä¶ I saw them: the arms, pale bones wrapped in strips of decaying flesh, fingertips hooked over the mattress‚Äôs edge.

And this time, the shadow trailing behind them *wasn‚Äôt* shapeless. It was a body, or, the memory of one. It slowly lifted its head - a thin, translucent face sagging in patches like wax left in the sun.

And Uncle Neighbor wasn‚Äôt done moving closer.

**The Cage**

After that night ‚Äî the night when Uncle Neighbor‚Äôs shadowed, half-formed body dragged itself closer with breaths echoing beneath the bed ‚Äî nothing was the same.

It wasn‚Äôt just that sleep became impossible. It wasn‚Äôt just that the bruises, the footsteps, the taps, and the shadows continued. It was something worse. Something that crept in between us, my husband and me. Filling the small cracks in our lives until there was nothing but tension and fear and silence.

It was like we were being trapped. Caged.

At first, I didn‚Äôt realize how it was happening. Uncle Neighbor didn‚Äôt burst in like a thief. He was patient ‚Äî a quiet predator.

He started whispering unintelligibly in the small spaces between our words. It was a quiet, invisible division.

After weeks of broken sleep, I noticed the way my husband‚Äôs eyes darkened whenever I mentioned the arms. I would ask about his day or mention something strange happening, only to see him flinching, eyes flickering with something like fear‚Äîor maybe frustration, and then a coldness settled over him.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just your imagination,‚Äù he said, voice clipped yet again and ragged as ever. It was always gravelly and shredded when he spoke now. Probably because he hardly spoke at all.

The absurdity of his statement this late in the game would have made me laugh, had I had the energy.

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not,‚Äù I replied flatly. Then venomously, ‚Äú*You* saw it too. You can‚Äôt pretend you never told me. You can‚Äôt pretend it‚Äôs not real. It‚Äôs much too late for that.‚Äù I stared at my hands on the table without seeing them, picking my thumbs.

His jaw clenched, and he walked away without a word. I dropped my hands, catching myself tearing at my own skin, little drops of blood dripping onto the hardwood. I cried at the realization my husband didn‚Äôt stop me from picking my thumbs. Not anymore.

# Featured Changes

* [Character flight is NOW POSSIBLE!](https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN/pull/6731) That's right, bird mutants will soon be able to take to the skies without a helicopter! But not just mutants are benefitting, the cyborgs amongst the crowd can also take to the skies provided they have the right bionic!
* [You can change your haircuts now with a Lua mod!](https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN/pull/6875) A much-requested feature has been added by jeremy7986 in the Discord! (RobbieTheNeko aka Rosa added it to the repo with his permission as proxy due to him being unable to use Github).
* [Bullets can now overpenetrate through enemies!](https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN/pull/6867) You've probably already heard about this through Chaosvolt's post(s), but it bears repeating and acknowledging here.
* [Melee weapons can now deal non-physical damage!](https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN/pull/6963) So long as they're using the more modern attack definitions, they can now deal elemental damage types without needing to use the old `FLAMING` flag and its cousins!
* [The self-aware trait is now obsoleted, and its effects are an in-game setting now!](https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN/pull/6890) Now you can know exactly how much HP and Calories you have at will! But you can still select the classic 'bars' when you feel like it, or when they are more helpful.
* [The cost to add a lot of electronics to the grid has been dropped!](https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN/pull/6910) After all, most of these *are* able to be plugged into an outlet in real life, so it doesn't make sense to need the whole electrical components suite just to plug 'em in.
* The lakes of the world are getting major updates!
   * [There are more naturally-spawning boats and they spawn in many more places!](https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN/pull/6904)
   * [A bunch of lakebed content has also been added!](https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN/pull/6903) From raft boat ""hulls"" to new professions, the lakes are getting a lot livelier!

1mr8ajp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reno/comments/1mr8ajp/renos_coffee_scene_why_local_shops_keep_closing/,Reno‚Äôs Coffee Scene: Why Local Shops Keep Closing and Chains Keep Winning,"Another local and independently owned coffee shop closes: [https://www.rgj.com/story/life/food/2025/08/14/star-village-coffee-not-renewing-lease/85663160007/](https://www.rgj.com/story/life/food/2025/08/14/star-village-coffee-not-renewing-lease/85663160007/)

I'm seeing this happen time and time again.  Do your research, folks?  Quargo Coffee is still on hold after $43,000 in permit costs overruns (for a coffee shop)

If you‚Äôve lived in Reno-Sparks long enough, you‚Äôve probably noticed a pattern: every time a cool, independent coffee shop opens and I fall in love with it‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs gone a few years later. Meanwhile, Starbucks is multiplying like rabbits; they‚Äôre up to¬†**41 locations**¬†in the metro area (42 if you count the one currently under construction). Dutch Bros has staked out drive-thru turf all over town. Even Dunkin‚Äô is quietly planting flags.

Over the past 15 years, we‚Äôve lost a lot: Star Village Coffee on Mill Street, multiple Bibo Coffee locations, several Hub Coffee Roasters cafes, and others like Caf√© Capello. These weren‚Äôt bad businesses ‚Äî they had loyal customers and strong brands. The problem? The game is tilted against them.

**The Big Issues**

* **Rising commercial rents**¬†‚Äî Landlords know chains can pay more and sign longer leases, so small shops get priced out or booted for redevelopment.
* **Tech & convenience**¬†‚Äî Chains have the apps, mobile ordering, loyalty programs, and drive-thrus that customers now expect.
* **Economies of scale**¬†‚Äî Starbucks can buy coffee, cups, and equipment cheaper than any local roaster ever could.
* **Parking & location shifts**¬†‚Äî Many locals started in Midtown or downtown, but customers increasingly want suburban parking and quick service.

**Reno Coffee: A Love Story (That Usually Ends in a Breakup)**  
If you‚Äôve been here long enough, you‚Äôve probably noticed the cycle: Reno gets an awesome local coffee shop, it builds a loyal crowd, and then‚Ä¶ poof. Doors close.

Here‚Äôs the quick-and-bitter history of some of Reno‚Äôs most beloved (and beleaguered) coffee names:

**Star Village Coffee ‚Äì Cultural Identity and Economic Barriers**  
Star Village Coffee‚Äôs departure from their Mill Street location in 2025 represents one of the most recent and well-documented examples of the challenges facing independent coffee shops in Reno. The Native-owned business announced on¬†**July 29, 2025**, via Instagram that they would not renew their lease after declining what they characterized as an¬†*unsustainable lease extension offer*.

The company‚Äôs statement provides crucial insight into the systemic barriers facing minority-owned businesses in the current market environment:

>‚ÄúThe offer did not reflect what we believe a sustainable partnership should look like, particularly for our small family-owned company. This experience has been a stark reminder of how difficult it remains for Native businesses to compete in today‚Äôs economic landscape. The historical marginalization of tribal communities is not just a chapter in the past, it continues to show up in how we access capital, real estate, and opportunity. And in today‚Äôs political climate, those barriers often feel even more entrenched.‚Äù 

Star Village‚Äôs business model emphasized cultural authenticity and community connection, offering unique beverages such as¬†**pine nut and maize lattes**¬†that reflected their Native heritage. Their mission focused on¬†*‚Äúcelebrating Indigenous excellence through coffee while creating lasting economic and cultural impact for Native communities‚Äù*.

However, their experience shows how¬†**real estate market dynamics**¬†can overwhelm even successful, well-loved businesses. The inability to secure sustainable lease terms reflects a broader trend where commercial real estate development prioritizes maximum rent over community stability.

They‚Äôve said they‚Äôre seeking a new location ‚Äî a reminder that closures aren‚Äôt always about bad management or lack of customers, but often about¬†**structural economic forces outside an owner‚Äôs control**.

**Closure 2: Bibo Coffee Company ‚Äì Development Pressure and Location Instability**  
Bibo Coffee‚Äôs story shows how real estate development can undermine even long-standing local favorites. Founded in 2003, Bibo built a strong brand on¬†**fresh-roasted coffee and handmade gelato**¬†\[3\], growing into multiple locations across Reno.

The trouble began with their¬†**Record Street shop**¬†near UNR ‚Äî a student favorite. In October 2019, that location was forced to close when the building was sold for demolition.

Co-owner Debbie Spieker-Martin explained:

>‚ÄúThe Record Street shop had been on a month-to-month lease with the owners who had purchased the building in 2018; last month, Spieker-Martin received a call from the owners giving her a 30-day notice to vacate.‚Äù 

Bibo considered opening a replacement near UNR but couldn‚Äôt find suitable space. And the closures didn‚Äôt stop there ‚Äî their¬†**South Reno location**¬†at the Southcreek center on Foothill Road closed in January 2025.

**Pattern:**¬†Losing multiple locations in quick succession hurt their brand presence and economics, showing how¬†**location instability**¬†can create a downward spiral for independents.

**Closure 3: Hub Coffee Roasters ‚Äì Operational Complexity and Market Pressures**  
Hub Coffee Roasters might be Reno‚Äôs most famous artisanal roaster ‚Äî but their path has been anything but smooth. Founded in 2009 out of a garage on Cheney Street, Hub grew on small-batch roasting, community vibe, and even¬†**ownership stakes in three coffee farms in Colombia**.

But success came with headaches:

* **Cheney Street**¬†(original) ‚Äì closed due to parking problems in Midtown.
* **4001 S Virginia Street, Suite 6**¬†‚Äì closed.
* **131 Pine Street**¬†‚Äì closed.
* **941 N Virginia Street, Space B**¬†‚Äì closed.

The company still operates three locations as of 2025:

* Riverside by the Truckee River (opened 2012)
* Meadowcreek in South Reno (opened 2023)
* Newest/largest in the RED development (opened March 2025) \[4\]

Hub‚Äôs story shows that even¬†**experienced operators with a strong brand and product differentiation**¬†can struggle with relocation costs, operational complexity, and urban planning issues like parking shortages.

**Additional Documented Closures**  
The Reno Gazette Journal‚Äôs list of 2025 business closures included several other coffee-related losses:

* IMBƒ™B Custom Brew
* Cafe Capello
* The Loving Cup

While less documented, these closures further concentrate Reno‚Äôs coffee market in the hands of national chains.

**Can Locals Compete**  
Some are trying. The ones that survive tend to carve out a niche ‚Äî cultural connections like Star Village‚Äôs Native heritage drinks, hyper-local sourcing, or ultra-specialized roasting. Collaborations between local shops (bulk buying, shared marketing) could help level the playing field. But without changes in real estate dynamics or conscious consumer choices, we‚Äôll probably keep seeing ‚ÄúFor Lease‚Äù signs where our favorite indie cafes used to be.

Bottom line: Reno‚Äôs coffee culture isn‚Äôt dying ‚Äî it‚Äôs just becoming more corporate. Whether that‚Äôs good, bad, or inevitable depends on how much you value your Americano coming with a side of local identity.",1,1755287341.0,Reno,9,0.56,False

1mr89b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundChecked/comments/1mr89b8/investigate_if_the_best_countertop_microwave/,Investigate if the best countertop microwave Sharp SMC2266KS lives up to its power,"The Sharp SMC2266KS microwave has been the centerpiece of my kitchen for two weeks now, and it‚Äôs been quite the experience getting familiar with its design, functionality, and quirks. With a 2.2 cubic foot capacity and 1200 watts of power, this countertop microwave is clearly aimed at families and individuals who need something reliable, spacious, and versatile for reheating or preparing meals. At first glance, I was drawn to its sleek stainless steel finish, and let me just say, it fits perfectly in any modern kitchen. But there‚Äôs more to this microwave than just looks.

**Design and Build**  
The brushed stainless steel finish on this microwave gives it a polished and professional look, which feels more upscale than most typical models. At 19.6 x 24.4 x 13.6 inches, the Sharp SMC2266KS is large, but that‚Äôs expected considering the 2.2 cubic feet of interior space it packs. The size is both a blessing and a challenge. While the interior comfortably fits large casserole dishes and serving trays (seriously, my lasagna tray fit with room to spare), it might not be ideal for small kitchens with limited counter space. The LED display is crisp and easy to read, and I immediately noticed the upgraded gray interior paired with LED interior lighting. It‚Äôs bright enough to clearly see your food while cooking, which I personally appreciated because I tend to hover when reheating leftovers.

**Performance**  
Power is where this microwave shines. With 1200 watts under the hood, heating food is quick and consistent. The 16.5-inch carousel turntable provides even heating, and I tested this claim by defrosting chicken breasts‚Äîno cold spots! So far, the automatic Sensor Cook feature has been my favorite. Just place the food inside, and it calculates the optimal cooking time and power setting. Whether it‚Äôs reheating coffee, cooking frozen veggies, or baking potatoes, this microwave gets it right with minimal babysitting. The ‚Äú+30 seconds‚Äù button has also made my mornings much smoother; it‚Äôs a time-saver when I want to quickly heat my oatmeal without fiddling with precise settings.

[Find the best price for Sharp SMC2266KS on Amazon.](https://ultimodule.com/p/b0cnqb66mb/)

**Convenience Features**  
There are some thoughtful touches in its design. The Auto Defrost is particularly handy, offering both weight and time settings for thawing frozen meals, while Express Cook lets you set cook times with a single button press. Testing the Melt/Soften function for butter was super convenient when baking cookies with my daughter last weekend. Another thing worth mentioning is the Inverter Cooking Technology, which manages lower power levels better compared to older microwaves I‚Äôve owned. This ensures that delicate foods don‚Äôt get overcooked. On the less exciting side, the controls, while functional, feel a tad outdated. The buttons could use more tactile feedback, and though they get the job done, they lack the modern touch panel vibes trending these days.

**Upsides**  
- The large interior easily accommodates big trays and bowls.  
- Consistently heats and defrosts food evenly, thanks to the carousel and Sensor Cook.  
- Sleek stainless steel design matches most kitchen aesthetics.  
- Features like Melt/Soften, Auto Defrost, and +30 seconds add convenience.  
- LED lighting and display provide great visibility.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Takes up significant counter space, possibly a dealbreaker for small kitchens.  
- Button layout and usability feel slightly dated compared to other modern microwaves.  
- The stainless steel exterior, while beautiful, shows smudges and fingerprints almost instantly.  

**Competing Brands**  
When comparing the Sharp SMC2266KS to other popular countertop microwaves, I noticed a few trade-offs. A similar premium microwave like the Panasonic NN-SN966S, for example, matches it in power and capacity but includes slightly more sophisticated touch controls. On the other hand, the Toshiba EM131A5C-BS falls short of the Sharp‚Äôs capacity at only 1.2 cubic feet, though its compact size is great for small spaces. Unlike Sharp‚Äôs consistent cooking performance, some of my previous microwaves have struggled with uneven heating, leaving me with cold spots or boiling hot liquids. In my view, Sharp strikes a great balance between power, size, and functionality despite facing stiff competition.

**Value Proposition**  
For its size and range of features, this microwave offers strong cost-effectiveness. It‚Äôs not the cheapest model on the market, but it feels sturdy and reliable, making it more of an investment piece. Given that it‚Äôs ideal for families or individuals cooking larger portions, the value becomes apparent. Where some budget-friendly microwaves may skimp on power or even heating, this Sharp model sets itself apart by emphasizing performance and user-focused details. I haven‚Äôt had to second-guess its ability to get the job done, and that in itself feels worth every penny.

Reuters‚Äô June 2025 economic report confirms: Bahrain‚Äôs GDP growth is trending at 3.6%, with business reforms (including Sijilat) playing a starring role (Reuters). From the Diplomatic Area‚Äôs banks to the startup hubs around Bahrain Bay, you‚Äôll hear one word again and again‚ÄîSijilat.\
So what is the Sijilat portal, and why does it matter? How do you actually use it to form a company in Bahrain? You‚Äôll get detailed, practical answers here, plus insider tips, local anecdotes, and the cost breakdowns that every entrepreneur needs.\

Key figures for 2025:\
- GDP Growth Projection: 3.6% (Reuters)\
- Startup Registration Growth: +17% (Forbes Business)\
- 99% Foreign Ownership: Allowed for most business sectors (Keylink: Foreign Ownership)\
Bahrain‚Äôs government has doubled down on digital-first reform, aiming to outpace regional competitors like the UAE and Saudi Arabia, especially for SMEs and startups. Bahrain.com lists Sijilat as the country‚Äôs main commercial gateway since its upgrade in January 2025 (Bahrain.com).\
Importantly, business culture here is unique. Ramadan business hours, the warm ritual of Arabic coffee during negotiation pauses, and the quick exchange of WhatsApp contacts after a majlis‚Äîthat‚Äôs Bahrain. I recommend always scheduling meetings mid-morning (post-coffee, pre-lunch) and avoiding the last half hour before prayer times, especially for anything paperwork-related at MOICT.\
\
Sijilat Portal: Overview and Purpose\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in a professional setting.. It‚Äôs the digital heart of Bahrain company formation, commercial registration, and license management.\
\
Launched: 2017; major upgrade January 2025 (mobile-responsive, multilingual)\
Services: Commercial registration, name reservation, business activity selection, license applications, amendment requests, renewals, and e-payment\
Integrated with: LMRA (Labour Market Regulatory Authority), Tamkeen, EDB, Ministry of Municipalities, and other regulators\
\
Sijilat simplifies what used to be a maze of paperwork and government offices around the Diplomatic Area. Now, the entire company formation process is online. You don‚Äôt need to queue outside MOICT‚Äîunless you enjoy Seef District‚Äôs summer humidity.\
If you want the full procedural and legal specifics, the official registration guide lays out step-by-step instructions.\
\
Personal aside: The first time I used Sijilat, I was skeptical‚ÄîI‚Äôd been burned by clunky portals before. To my surprise, uploading documents and tracking application status was faster than ordering lunch at Bahrain Bay‚Äôs food court. The true power? Real-time notifications and digital approvals.\
\
\
Bahrain Company Formation: Step-by-Step with Sijilat\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation: digital company registration., Single Person Company (SPC), Branch Office, Foreign Company, Partnership, and more (Entity Types & Structures)\
* Since 2024, 99% foreign ownership is the norm‚Äîcompare that to the UAE‚Äôs free zone limitations and Saudi Arabia‚Äôs sponsorship requirements (Foreign Ownership)\
Best tip: For most foreign entrepreneurs, a WLL (equivalent to an LLC) is the most flexible option. If you want zero local partner headaches, opt for business activities that qualify for 100% foreign ownership (Foreigner-Friendly Activities).\
2. Prepare Required Documents\
Surprisingly, document requirements are more streamlined than in the wider GCC. Sijilat auto-generates much of the paperwork, but you‚Äôll still need:\
\
Passport copies of all owners/directors\
Address proof (recent utility bill or tenancy agreement)\
Bank reference letter (for some business activities)\
Memorandum and Articles of Association\
\
Insider tip: Draft your documents in both Arabic and English to speed up processing‚Äîavoid delays due to translation requirements. If you can, use the Sijilat document templates‚Äîthey‚Äôre updated for 2025 regulations. And, have your company stamp ready; certain original signatures are still required for final licensing.\
3. Name Reservation and Business Activity Selection\
\
Log into Sijilat (Official Portal)\
Propose three trade names (in order of preference)\
Select your business activities‚ÄîSijilat cross-references MOICT‚Äôs updated 2025 NBRIC codebook\
\
Common mistake: Entrepreneurs often select too broad or too many activities, triggering extra regulatory scrutiny and slowing down approval. Stick to your primary commercial activity. You can amend later.\
4. Submit Application via Sijilat\
Once documents and names are ready:\
- Complete the online application\
- Upload all supporting documents (PDF/JPG‚Äîmax 5MB per file)\
- Pay fees online (credit/debit/Bahraini benefit pay)\
Application processing typically takes 2‚Äì8 working days (2025 average: 3.2 days if all documents are perfect on first submission).\
Money-saving Bonus: If you want to avoid higher service fees, always apply for your initial commercial registration during off-peak periods‚Äîmid-week, around 9:30 am is ideal. MOICT‚Äôs Sijilat support is most responsive then, and you‚Äôll skip long virtual queues.\
5. Receive Digital Commercial Registration (CR)\
Once approved, you‚Äôll get a digital CR certificate‚Äîno need to visit any office. The system syncs with LMRA for labor approvals and other stakeholders.\
Pro tip: You can download a digital CR, but always print a few copies for official meetings. Bahrain banks and partners still like seeing the classic blue-stamped hardcopy, especially when dealing with older institutions in the Diplomatic Area.\

Costs and Budgeting for Bahrain Company Formation\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs: budgeting for company formation in Bahrain.\
\
Sijilat/MOICT Government Fees: BHD 50‚Äì150 (depends on business activity and structure)\
Name Reservation: BHD 25 (included in Sijilat application)\
Commercial Registration Renewal: BHD 50‚Äì100 (annual)\
Legal and Notarization Fees: BHD 20‚Äì50\
Virtual Office Space (Seef/Manama): BHD 180‚Äì350/month\
Professional Service Provider (setup assistance, translation, licensing): BHD 250‚Äì600 (one-time)\
\
For a full cost breakdown, see: Bahrain Company Formation Cost Guide.\
Budget range (bare minimum): BHD 350‚Äì600 for a basic WLL structure, excluding ongoing rent and staffing.\
\
If you‚Äôre especially cost-sensitive, consider starting in a Bahrain Free Zone for zero import/export taxes and discounted office rates (Bahrain Free Zones).\
Compare these numbers to typical UAE mainland licenses (AED 15,000‚Äì50,000/year) or Saudi CRs (SAR 3,500+ per year)‚ÄîBahrain saves you real money.\
\
\
Small tangent: I once calculated that a simple e-commerce WLL in Bahrain (with 100% foreign ownership) cost me 30% less than a comparable startup license in Dubai. That‚Äôs including all Sijilat fees, banking, and a year of office rent.\
\
\
Bahrain‚Äôs 2025 Regulatory Changes: What You Need To Know\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation: business regulations in Bahrain.\
- Enhanced digital KYC, removing the need for in-person bank letters for most structures‚Äîespecially helpful for overseas founders\
- Stricter AML & CFT compliance for certain sectors (finance, crypto, real estate)\
MOICT also announced mandatory quarterly digital compliance reporting from July 2025. Get ready to link your accounting system or use a registered service (Accounting & Bookkeeping Services). Trust me, the system will send escalating digital reminders if you miss filing deadlines.\
And in 2025, Bahrain formalized new Ramadan business hours for all public sector processing: 8:00am‚Äì2:00pm, with a late afternoon break for prayer and iftar. Schedule your Sijilat submissions with this in mind.\

LMRA manages work permits and visas, integrated with Sijilat for smoother onboarding\
Local sponsorship is only needed for a handful of restricted activities (Local Sponsorship Guide)\
\
Mistake to avoid: Many business owners forget to update their address or activity changes with Sijilat, risking fines or CR suspension. Double-check all details after any company update.\
Local Networking and Support\
Majlis-style business gatherings, Tamkeen innovation grants, and the Bahraini tradition of offering gahwa (Arabic coffee) during negotiations‚Äîthese cultural touchpoints open doors. Don‚Äôt skip them. I once gained a banking partner simply by showing up early to a Manama networking breakfast and striking up a conversation over dates and cardamom coffee.\

Sijilat: Practical Tips for Founders\
\
Best office locations: Seef District and Bahrain Bay have the fastest internet and best service center access. Avoid Diplomatic Area branch crowds.\
Document hacks: Use Sijilat‚Äôs PDF merger tool to combine multi-page uploads; it reduces rejected files.\
Application timing: 9:30‚Äì11:00 am mid-week (Tuesday/Wednesday) means fastest MOICT digital approval‚Äîbefore the lunchtime prayer break.\
Name selection: Short, easy-to-pronounce brand names get through the approval queue ~40% faster, based on my experience.\
Relationship-building: Always greet government staff with a polite ‚ÄúSabah al-khair‚Äù and accept offered coffee‚Äîit goes a long way, even in digital-first Bahrain.\

The Bahrain vs UAE/Saudi Arabia Company Formation Comparison\
UAE offers speed in some free zones, but 100% foreign ownership is only for limited activities or comes with high capital requirements. Saudi Arabia mandates local sponsorship for foreign investors and paperwork often drags. Bahrain‚Äôs Sijilat, by contrast? Lower cost, clearer process, and a strong digital support backbone.\
\
Recommended Resources and Service Providers\
If you‚Äôre new to Sijilat or facing document headaches, I strongly recommend working with a local corporate service provider. Keylink is the team I‚Äôve personally used‚Äîthey know the unwritten rules and shortcut routes (and can often get document signatures validated before noon, even during Ramadan).\

Wait, Is This Even REAL?!","Okay. Wait. Hold up. Am I totally *missing something*, or did I just‚Ä¶make $100 in a WEEK‚Ä¶literally just playing with apps on my phone?!

I feel like I need someone to pinch me because, honestly, what is reality? Look, I‚Äôm not some super genius or coder‚ÄîI‚Äôm literally the friend who forgets their passwords EVERY time. üòÖ But this past week, I fell down a rabbit hole and somehow wound up cashing out more than I ever expected.

So, here‚Äôs what happened:

- I was doomscrolling (as usual), sipping cold coffee, when I saw someone drop a link: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  
- Naturally, being 80% skepticism, I clicked on it with my scam radar FULLY on.
- Fifteen minutes later I was still glued to my phone‚Äîexcept instead of losing time, it looked like I was *earning* money? Testing new mobile apps?  
- Um, what exactly was happening? Was this legal? Was I dreaming??

***Spoiler: it‚Äôs real.***

So, how did I actually rack up $100?

- I signed up at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (the process took, like, two minutes).
- Started picking app-testing tasks‚Äîinstall, play test, sometimes write a review or capture a screenshot.
- Most tasks took less than five minutes (!)
- After each task, my little dashboard $$$ total ticked up‚Äîit‚Äôs actually kind of addicting?
- By day four, I was steadily checking my progress‚Ä¶like, could YOU stop if you saw tiny digital dollars lining up?

But wait. I was *super convinced* some catch was coming. Maybe they'd demand a kidney?  
Nope.

- PayPal payout‚Äîno hidden fees, no disappearing earnings.  
- I even asked a few IRL friends to try it, and they got their payout within 24 hours.

Here‚Äôs what I still cannot figure out:

- How have I never heard of **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** before??
- Is this one of those ‚Äútoo good to be true‚Äù things OR have I just unlocked the ultimate side hustle?  
- Why aren‚Äôt more people screaming about this??

For anyone skeptical (like me üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), this is what I learned:

- Most of these apps are desperate for real user feedback before launch.
- Your download = real market insight for them, so it‚Äôs kind of a win/win.
- And if you *hate* a test? Skip it! Plenty of new ones pop up daily.

I‚Äôm NOT saying you‚Äôll retire off this, but $100 for doing *literally nothing special* this week is blowing my mind.
Even if you snag an extra $20 here or there, it beats scrolling Instagram for free, right?

TRY IT NOW: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  
If you‚Äôve made it this far, you owe it to yourself to poke around the site.  
I‚Äôm still not sure if I‚Äôm dreaming. But if I am, don‚Äôt wake me up.

Anyone else exhausted all their ‚Äúnormal‚Äù side hustles? Or is this the sign you needed? For science, of course üòÇ

Leave your questions, share your wildest app side hustle, or just scream into the void because, wow, this is wild.

2024, and the attraction was mutual. He was so attentive a dream guy until, within two weeks of knowing him, he said he was married but ""in the process of getting a divorce."" I wanted to stop talking to him, but I believed him when he said he was in the process and still living in the same house. So, I gave him the benefit of the doubt, and we continued to see each other. There was no sexual interaction; I told him I couldn't do that to myself or his partner. He said he understood and only wanted me to wait for him, and that he was okay with no sex until everything was finalized with his wife.
In April, he moved out, and we made plans. He invited me to his room where he was staying. I told him I would go, but no sex; I didn't want to yed. I went, and we were watching TV he started kissing me. I tried to stop him, but he didn't, and he ended up having sex without my consent. I didn't answer his calls and blocked him. After two weeks, he sent me a message from a different number and told me he went back to his house. I was heartbroken, and also  because he didn't respect my boundaries, I felt that the whole divorce thing was a lie too.
A few weeks ago, we reconnected again, just talking, and I made things clear to him that nothing could happen between us anymore. But I did fall in love with him, and it have been hard to complete move on. He invited me to his shop for coffee, I went but I told him just as friends, he locked the door and started kissing me. I told him to stop, but he tried to take my clothes off. When he tried to pull my pants down I said, ""I can't, I'm sick and can't have sex."" Then, he ejaculated on top of  me. At the end, he didn't apologize. He said, ""See what you do It's your fault. Look at your body i cant control myself."" I left when I didn't answer the next day, his calls and texts  he said, ""Why are you doing this, this is hurting both of us.""

The prayer ritual went on for maybe a week longer. Matt had begun losing track of what day it was. He figured it could be March or late February, but he didn't put much effort into finding out. He had grown accustomed to the daily repetition of waking, eating, praying (or rather sitting there pretending to pray), eating, drawing then sleeping. He saw no improvement in the state of his brother, the only difference was that he might finally be going nose-blind to the horrific smell that came from the room. The routine became unquestionable, the same things happened every single day, and as such it was a surprise when in the morning, as the priest was changing into his uniform, he put on a different robe than normal. This one was not black as was his usual attire, in fact it was a clean and bright purple.

Purple, with gold stitching, and large sleeves, and an oversized hood. The hood of the robe bowed so low; it nearly enclosed the opening of the neck entirely. Matt wondered what the point of having a space for the head was at all on such a garment. He stared at the priest in this bizarre new outfit, pausing halfway through buttoning his shirt. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù the small boy asked, large bright eyes darting around the details of the robe.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just switching things up, today is the last day of this phase of the process. I‚Äôll be wearing this going forward.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôdo the clothes have to do with anything?‚Äù the boy asked, genuinely confused. Father Kirkland thought for a moment, unsure of what to say.

‚ÄúThey're stronger.‚Äù He decided upon, and this was sufficient enough for young Matthew as he did not ask further questions.¬†

The ritual went much the same that day, with nothing special to note, at least to Matthew. He just played through his daydreams like a moving-picture until it was over. This time however the priest did not follow the two out of the room. Instead, as Matt and Angela began to leave, he turned to them. ‚ÄúCould you bring me two buckets of water. I will need more items as I go, but just that and a rag will be enough to start.‚Äù

Angela poured water from the bathtub faucet into buckets as Matt carried them, one at a time, with great effort, to the priest. He smiled underneath the grand hood and thanked the youngster. The priest disappeared into the room well past sundown. There were screams, both high pitched and deep and bellowing. Matt figured they were both David. There were curses hurled and cries to get away from him, all of which were presumably ignored.

Angela‚Äôs hands shook nervously as she cooked. She had finished and she sat at the table with Matt while they waited for the priest. After an hour or so of waiting, she permitted Matt to eat, and she rose to go check on Father Kirkland and her son. As she approached the door, the priest stepped out, his robe now dark with blood and water. She looked at him and he only said, ‚ÄúI will need nine bowls‚Ä¶ filled with water.‚Äù and then walked past her, beginning the process of removing the robe. Angela stood for a bit then carefully opened the door to the room, quiet wheezing leaked from within.

Inside, David lay curled into a ball, but he was no longer lying in his own filth. The sheets of blood and excrement sat beside the bed, and now David lay on a clean blanket atop a naked mattress. He still was a grotesque and rotting thing, but now he no longer seemed a gargoyle infernally attached to his plot.

As David took notice of her peeking, he moved his great head, turning it at a nasty angle upwards, smearing the clean blanket with a fresh and shining streak of blood and some loose, brown skin. Angela shut the door and scurried back towards the living room.

\#

When the trio entered the room the following morning, David was lying, hands at his side, flat out across the bed. His face had poured new leakage onto the bare mattress, the creases producing their ever-flowing pus and blood, His face at least resembled something that looked like it once could have been alive. It still twisted and pulled into a gruesome rictus. His yellow teeth peeking out of swollen gums and rotting lips like tiny gold nuggets.

Matt let out somewhat of a gasp, it had been a while since he‚Äôd seen his brother as cleaned up as he was, as low of a bar as that might've been as the boy was currently lying in his own excrement. The priest was up early that morning, working, presumably, on the arrangement of the room. In a circle around the bed, which had been pulled from its spot against the wall, were the nine bowls, each facing upward and filled to the brim with water.¬†

The priest was rummaging through his briefcase, which lay open on the nightstand that now stood across the room from David's bed. Angela had assumed her praying position upon the ground in front of the circle of bowls. The priest had his back turned; Matt was the only one looking at his brother. Matt‚Äôs eyes held fear and pity, he wished his brother well, but he hated to see him.

David held his eye contact, his eyes venomous and his mouth spitting vulgarities that were pushed through a newly developed lisp. His tongue and cheek had swollen so badly he could no longer speak properly. The cave-walls of his mouth offered no room for the slug of a tongue to maneuver. Matt had become deaf to his brothers curses and as such said nothing, he just stared at the skin and bones shell of his brother, and for a second, he could‚Äôve sworn, looking into the right side of his face, he saw David‚Äôs expression relax a bit, sending Matt‚Äôs mind reeling through the memories he and David had together.

Father Kirkland‚Äôs voice snapped Matt‚Äôs mind back to the present, ‚ÄúAlright David, let's get this started.‚Äù David's head whipped away from Matt and to the priest. Matt now could only see the hideousness that ruined his brother's life. Matt got to his knees to pray, his slacks filled with small cushions he engineered (made from cotton from a pillow and cloth from an old shirt), and shut one eye, the other on Father Kirkland.

He pulled a bottle from his briefcase, glass and green. He reached in once more, not looking up, and pulled from it four white handkerchiefs. He placed them on the floor in a row, open. Pulling the cork from the green bottle, he dribbled a circle-like shape onto each one, putting four dots within the circle of each. The liquid upon the cloth resembled olive oil and the smell confirmed it. Father Kirkland in two quick steps was beside David. He grabbed the boy's scrawny right forearm from where it lay at his stomach. The priest manipulated the forearm to the right corner of the bed. There was resistance from the boy. His atrophied muscles fought back. They pulsed from beneath his pale skin like steel wires under tension, but the priest still managed to get the hand to the corner fairly easily. David screamed for the priest to get away from him, which was ignored. Matt tore his eyes from the scene to his mother, who kneeled at the other corner of the room, hands clasped over her mouth. The priest let go the boy's arm and as David began to swing it back into place, the priest lightly tossed one of the cloths onto the boy's wrist. His arm slammed back into the bed, as if pinned to the spot the priest put it. David let out a pressed breath, sounding like a piston releasing pressure. Father Kirkland repeated this thrice more, until each of the boy's limbs were corresponding with a corner of the bed. David was howling, and Matt looked on, his young mind filled with confusion. *Was his older brother now so weak he could not lift a handkerchief?*¬†

The priest walked back to his briefcase in no particular hurry now as David lurched his head left and right, seemingly aiming to bite at the handkerchiefs like a dog, to no success. The priest pulled out a rectangular thing, wrapped in a blue towel. He unwrapped it slowly, revealing a well-polished wooden block, maybe nine inches lengthwise and six inches wide and tall. Matt squinted and saw upon it a carved crucifix, rudimentary, like someone took to it with a knife and etched. On the crucifix was a depiction of Christ, his features also just a knife stroke on the shining, beautiful wood.

The priest, as David gnashed his rotting teeth at him, placed the block dead center the boy's chest, and from Matt‚Äôs point of view it seemed David was pressed into the bed, like the block weighed hundreds of pounds. David also let out a choking, forced breath, and then struggled to get a lungful back in. The priest then assumed his post in front of the bed and began to recite. Matt snapped his head back into his fake prayer position. This session was much more quiet, as David no longer screamed and howled and bellowed, he just wheezed, and gasped for breath. Matt felt guilty watching his brother suffer. He knew not to intervene, yet there was a growing discomfort in his stomach, like that of watching someone being wronged.¬†

Eventually the session was called to an end when he heard Father Kirkland‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmen.‚Äù He stood quickly, for this session his mind did not wander, he just choked down unease as he heard his brother gasp and sputter for hours. As soon as he was up, his eyes were upon the large block on his brother's chest, and he watched, almost quivering until the priest reached over his brother and pulled it from his chest. With how easily Father Kirkland removed the block, Matt figured it couldn't have weighed much at all, but perhaps in the condition David was in it still did cause him great pain. As soon as the block was lifted David began coughing violently, *at least that was familiar*, thought Matthew. The priest then reached to each of the boy's limbs, retrieving the handkerchiefs, and immediately David curled into a fetal position atop the bed, his arms against his chest, as he continued to hack. The priest set the supplies aside, and turned to Angela and Matt and led them from the room, pausing Matt mid-step to prevent him from kicking one of the bowls that surrounded the bed.

\#

Matt thought as he swallowed down the soup later that night. Angela was in David's room ensuring his feeding tube was operating correctly as he hadn't been heard coughing for a good while. Later still when the priest was back into his night clothes and his journal was closed and set aside for the night, Matt played with two marbles he had in hand as to keep himself from falling asleep. Eventually, Father Kirkland‚Äôs breathing slowed, below a pace Matt could follow without losing his breath, and he figured the priest was well asleep now. He rose from his bed, holding his weight high so as to not creak upon the floor. Once again, sock footed, he tip-toed past the priest and into the hallway and eventually to the room at the end of it. He pressed his ear against it, to which he heard nothing. He put his lips to the crack of the door, and whispered ‚ÄúDavid?‚Äù No response. He tried again. ‚ÄúDavid?‚Äù and after a moment of silence:

‚ÄúMatthew.‚Äù a voice answered. A voice Matt thought sounded like it was right behind the door, instead of from the bed.¬†

‚ÄúAre you alright? H-how‚Äôre you feeling?‚Äù¬†

Once again, a pause, before a choked-down cough, then: ‚ÄúYou need to help me Matt.‚Äù This was the closest thing to his brother's voice he‚Äôd heard in a long time, only it was infected with a wetness in the throat, some scratchiness and the slightest lisp. Matt hesitated a bit before he began to ask.¬†

‚ÄúWhat do yo-‚Äù

‚ÄúCarry me Matt. Take me to the chapel, *please* Matt.‚Äù The response tore away the connection he began to feel with his brother's voice. *Always that damned church.* The kid thought. Before he even began to speak again ‚ÄúYou need to help me Matt, they're going to kill me.‚Äù

‚ÄúDavid-‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, just open the door, let me out, carry me-‚Äù

‚ÄúDavid, stop.‚Äù Matt said louder, almost at a speaking tone. Matt continued back to a whisper ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to carry you.‚Äù A moment of silence. ‚ÄúI know you can walk,‚Äù *scarily fast* he thought to himself,‚Äù Why don't you just go yourself?‚Äù¬†

There was no response. He waited a moment, and still no answer came. Eventually a string of coughs rang from within the room; this time sounding as if they were from the distance of the bed. Matt turned his ear from the door and pressed his back against it. ‚ÄúI want to help you.‚Äù he said, quietly yet he did not doubt David heard him. ‚ÄúI love you, David.‚Äù There was no reciprocation, so he walked, tears warming his eyes, back to the couch that he called his bed.¬†

\#

The next morning was a copy of the prior, oats were eaten, coffee was prepared-for Angela and the priest (Matt was not allowed to have coffee yet) and once they were dressed they began their approach to the room. Matt always found the walk less scary with the sunlight lighting the hall and the priest and his mom by his side. They entered the room, Father Kirkland with his large hood pulled over his face. David was lying face down, perpendicular to the bed, his feet hanging off, but he was motionless and presumably asleep.

As Father Kirkland picked up the four cloths and approached the bed, David whipped around with an asthmatic snort, his skeletal fingers outstretched with yellow, jagged edged and long nails- the doctor was the one who cut David's nails so the duty was unattended to. The priest was narrowly missed by one of the hands. Angela yelped, yelling for David to stop. Father Kirkland grabbed the boy's wrist, almost lifting his light frame from the bed and slamming him back onto the mattress before securing the wrist with a handkerchief. Matt thought he heard the priest mutter ‚ÄúPig‚Ä¶‚Äù

David did not try any other tricks as Father Kirkland placed the other handkerchiefs in place. David let out a gurgling breath as the block was placed upon his chest again. Matt pushed his brother's stuttering gasps out of his head, or at least tried to, as the ritual began again. He had forgotten to put in his knee cushions but all he could think of was how miserable he would be if he were choking and struggling to breathe for so long.

\#

That night, with no second thought, Matt tracked the priest's chest rising and falling, and faster than last time, he was off of the couch and padding down the hallway, his white shirt in harsh contrast with the deep shadows of his surroundings. ‚ÄúDavid.‚Äù he called in a whisper, sure of a response.¬†

‚ÄúMatt‚Äù the voice called back, it sounded weaker this time, and didn't sound right up on the door as it did the night before.¬†

‚ÄúWhy do you keep asking about the church?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôd fix me up of course. I wouldn't have to be sick anymore. All I‚Äôd have to do is pray and I‚Äôll be all better‚Äù The sentence was followed by an internal, acidic sounding belch.

‚ÄúBut last time we took you to church you ran away and made a whole scene, Momma was so mad-‚Äù

‚ÄúBahh‚Äù David's voice cut him off. ‚ÄúThat wasn't the church.‚Äù

Matt stood confused, staring off down the hallway. David continued ‚ÄúThe real ones in the woods. You remember those woods??‚Äù

Matt thought back to the dark forest behind the church, then the silence of all the creatures within at as he and David were caught looking upon the deer and the spider in the clearing, and then his shoes at the tree line, beckoning him in, and their run through the forest, trying to get out as fast as they could because *something* was following. Matt shuddered, the hairs on his neck standing on end, then nodded. He responded audibly, ‚ÄúI remember.‚Äù, realizing David couldn't see his nod.¬†

‚ÄúWe didn't go *deep* enough, there was more, we should have gone further. We could have explored.‚Äù

Matt stayed silent so David continued.

‚ÄúWe still can! We can leave, take me to the church so I can get some real help. The priest doesn't know what he‚Äôs doing! He‚Äôs an idiot! A fool!‚Äù Matt began to tense at the rising of his brother's voice. He was trying to keep his meetings to the room a secret. David continued ‚ÄúThe doctor, your mother, none of them know what they're doing! Take me to the church Matthew! Take me to the woods! We can worship! I can show you how great our god is! Let me show you how much the stone bleeds! Oh, there's buckets of it! There‚Äôs oceans that can be filled! There‚Äôs-‚Äù

‚ÄúDavid, stop!‚Äù Matt said, raising his voice but doing so only the bare minimum.¬†

David's voice returned in a whisper ‚ÄúSo will you take me Matt, pretty please?‚Äù

Matt sighed, ‚ÄúNo-‚Äù¬†

From the shadows burst movement. From the shadowed pitch-black corner of the hall, shot out a skeletal-thin arm, shoulder and David‚Äôs Massive swollen and rotten head. Matt jumped, originally out of the fright of sudden and unexpected movement and then again as he realized it was David, coming from a space that could not possibly have hidden his frame. His voice had come from the inside of the room, not the empty corner anyway, but Matt had no time to think. David lunged at him, and Matt sprinted down the hall, hearing his brother's body collide with the door that Matt was leaning against.

He ran down the hallway. The same feeling he felt running from some unseen presence in the forest nipped at his neck and made his legs fire faster than ever, this time with the physical body of David chasing behind him, his large head wobbling with his stumbling, lurching run on his bony frame. The IV needle and tube were still hanging from the crook of his elbow, his feeding tube swinging from his stomach. Matt felt his wheezing, sickly, wet breath on his neck.

Matt was almost at the living room, directly at its entrance when he felt a hard hand grasp his shoulders. He wanted to scream but it got stuck in his throat. He looked with eyes wide at his brother's face as it hung from David's shoulders onto his left collarbone, the face resembled something between roadkill and a deep-sea creature, David coughed, spraying David directly with bloody saliva. Matt could feel the unkempt fingernails digging into his shoulder like rough shards of glass. Before David could do anything to him, Matt pushed him, he felt the ribs hard and protruding from his brother's emaciated chest. He saw in one quick movement as David‚Äôs thin legs tangled with one another, already uncoordinated as they were, and David fell backwards, his heavy head leading the fall.

David's head hit the wooden floor with a dreadful squelch, just as it had done in the playground. David lay unmoving, his arms sticking out at his sides, and legs splayed, in total contrast with his massive head, that now spurted blood unnaturally fast and strong across the floor.

Matt put his hands to his eyes then his mouth, unsure of what to cover, *David fell again, David is dead, I pushed him, I killed David, I killed my brother, oh god, why can't things go back to the way they were, I killed my brother, I love David, I‚Äôm so sorry, I killed my brother, please stop bleeding, please stand up, please, let's go play, I didn't mean to, I‚Äôm so sorry, David, I love you, I'm so sorry*. But he said none of this, tears poured down his cheeks, and he screamed, he screamed and screamed until it turned into sobbing. Father Kirkland, who was just on the couch, arrived to him first, followed soon after by Angela. The priest picked the small boy up, holding him in his arms as he sobbed, Angela rubbed the boys back. The two adults looked at each other, there was a confused look shared between them, a question they both had but neither had an answer.

‚ÄúWhat happened, Matt?‚Äù Angela asked, as the priest felt his shoulder grow wet with tears. Matt couldn't pull an answer from his jumping throat. The two adults looked at each other, at Matt, then at the empty, dark hallway leading to David's room. A single cough could be heard from inside.¬†

\#

Matt slept the rest of the night in Angela‚Äôs room and bed, cuddled with his mother. He never did stop crying enough to explain. He cried himself right into a deep sleep. The next morning, the adults rose first. Angela met Father Kirkland in the kitchen as he nursed a cup of coffee. He told her they must move further in the exorcism; whatever was within David shouldn‚Äôt have such a strong hold this far in. The original plan was to continue this phase of the exorcism for at least three weeks, but they must advance to the finalis.",2,1755286646.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

We usually only spent 1-2 days together a week due to our schedules but went on a few trips/vacations. We have had a few disagreements but nothing that I thought was major. Usually, it was a miscommunication. Like one time we were supposed to meet after her work, I thought she drove there so I took the bus and we both ended up with no car.

In May, I received a job offer that wanted me to start early but I wanted to do right by my current employer and ended up working 2 jobs from early May to mid-June. My girlfriend had a long period out of state with her family due to someone passing. When she came back in May, we spent way more time with each other than we normally do and I was beyond tired. Due to work, I was an hour and a half late to our anniversary. This is my fault, I thought I could get out in time. Then a week later I didn't wake up and missed an event that was extremely important to her. Then a trip in early June we had big fight over miscommunication, she had lashed out (to me this is using words meant to hurt) at me which she had never done and I called her out on it. The entire trip seemed like a disaster.

After the trip, she withdrew from the relationship. She called and messaged me less, and I noticed she didn't share the same details as before. Prior to this she would initiate more often than I would. I may have been too annoying with asking her what was wrong the rest of the month. She finally told me, had a meltdown actually, at the end of June that she had felt for months that I take her for granted and as I make more money, we should not be splitting bills, etc. She told me she me that she could set that aside but the events in May were things she feels like she couldn't get past. She asked for space and we set boundaries that I could message her.

I basically sent a message or two each week in July, wishing her a good week or for holidays like the 4th. She would respond so I continued. We talked beginning of August and she told me she had not been able to think about us. I tried to explain May which she didn't care for. I told her that splitting the bill was something I thought she wanted to do (she is proud of being independent) and I had no problem paying. We had some small talk but she didn't tell me anything substantial. She did say she thought it be best we break up but wasn't sure.

We met up yesterday at a coffee shop. She told me she still didn't know if she wanted to be with me but she no longer saw our future. I asked if we could start slow with what she feels most comfortable with, we can just chat on the phone or go on coffee dates. She said she didn't see the point. She said that the events in May and my chasing in June was too much. She said talking about this was painful. I asked if she wanted to break up and she said she didn't know but thought it might be for the best. I said okay. She said maybe we can see how we feel in a few months, which I almost wish she didn't say. Can this relationship be saved?

I'm definitely not going to stop my life for this, but the ""see how we feel in a few months"" might be giving me false hope. Especially because it's not like I'm going to start dating again, it usually takes me awhile to get over a relationship. I want to reach out in a month but not sure if it's enough time.",2,1755286567.0,relationship_advice,8,1.0,False

The wizard reveals that their magic works on assumption(?) and that this world has no sun (the sun has been visible since halfway through the comic).,"Hey! I've tried every combination of search terms I can come up with I'm seriously at my wits end about this. Most of what I remember is in the title, more details below.

* The clearest part of the memory is that the two characters are talking about the nature of reality changing magic in a sci-fi 1950s style diner with the sky visible out a large window. The comic goes on for a while until at the end one character reveals that they changed something in the sky outside partway through the strip and the reader/other character didn't notice.
* Less clear parts. I think this was part of a longer running series where the main character was a female mechanic who repaired spaceships in a distant space-station. I believe the change in the sky was that there was a sun (or other celestial body) that we would expect added to the background despite not being possible. I recall it going on for a while and the frame never really changing off of that shot of them next to the window drinking coffee or whatever.
* I think I read this about 10 years ago, probably either on Reddit or Tumblr based on my social media usage during that time. I think Reddit is the more likely of the two, this feels like a r/comics post.

Please help, I remember this being such a cool comic and now nothing I search turns up any evidence that it ever existed. I'm sure I've gotten a key detail wrong or a keyword I'm using isn't the right one for the comic, I hope someone with a clearer memory can help me narrow this down.

HAve you heard that ChatGPT already supports Remote MCP connections?! You probably haven't noticed it yet, because it is only supported for **Pro, Team, Enterprise, and Edu plan** only. It‚Äôs not yet for everyone, but the signs are clear: this is coming to all users soon, and it will be a **game changer**.

Trust me (a random dude from the Internet) ‚Äî when it does, it‚Äôs going to blow the doors wide open. üöÄ

# ‚ö° What MCP Is (Plain English):

>***MCP is basically a way to give ChatGPT real-world superpowers.***

MCP stands for **Model Context Protocol** ‚Äî a new standard that lets AI models like ChatGPT connect to **external tools, APIs, and data sources** in real time.

**MCP**¬†is Like¬†**USB-C for ChatGPT**. One common plug to safely connects ChatGPT to¬†*any tool or data, any website, cloud application, service*.... anything! Need to order pizza? Schedule a ride home? Send email, pay for grocery, rent a car, buy a flight ticket, submit tax declaration, send flowers with a gift card to your sweethart - all done by chatting with ChatGPT! 

***If this is not a Brave New World, I don't know what it is ...***  

# üí° What is Remote MCP?

Remote MCP is MCP server that you run somewhere, which has your credentials to connect to all of these tools and is a code that translates ChatGPT commands into the API calls to a respective service.

***THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF MCP SERVERS IN GITHUB ALREADY!*** ANd this number is growing every single day!!!

# But there is a BUT... 

**Remote MCP** means those tools don‚Äôt have to live on your computer ‚Äî they can be running somewhere out there in the cloud, ready for ChatGPT to call whenever you need them.

**And here is a CATCH:**

Here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ MCP isn‚Äôt just something you *download*.  
You actually have to **run** it somewhere. And unless you have:

* A PhD in Computer Science
* 10+ years of software development under your belt
* Or a license in certified *black magic programming*

‚Ä¶you probably won‚Äôt get it working without a few tears, a gallon of coffee, and maybe a minor existential crisis.

# Enter: MCP Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è‚ú®

We are building [MCP Cloud](https://mcp-cloud.io/) is here to save the day!

**MCP Cloud is a new Platform that will help you to:**

* Run MCP tools without setting up scary servers
* Share them with other people instantly
* Even make a little money if you want to offer your tool to others

*When Remote MCP becomes available to all ChatGPT users, you won‚Äôt need to know how it works under the hood ‚Äî you‚Äôll just click ‚Äúconnect‚Äù and boom: ChatGPT can use your favorite tool, fetch your data, or automate your work.*

We are a small team working relentlessly on the [MCP Cloud](https://mcp-cloud.io/). Our **Beta release** has happened only a few days ago, ***but we already serve our first users!!!***

1mr7w4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mr7w4j/why_choose_geesta_charcoal_coffee_filters_honest/,Why Choose Geesta Charcoal Coffee Filters? Honest Review for Better Brews,"Having tested the Geesta Geesta09 12-Pack Replacement Charcoal Water Filters for Use with Cuisinart coffee machines, I can confidently talk about its practicality, features, and quirks. Over the past few weeks, I‚Äôve used this product to brew countless cups of coffee, putting it through various scenarios to measure its efficiency and reliability. There's much to love, but as with anything, there are a few points to consider.

**Elegant Design and Thoughtful Packaging**  
Right off the bat, I noticed the smart packaging of these charcoal water filters. Each filter comes individually packaged and sealed, preserving their quality until use. The fact that they are housed in a compact storage box is a big plus; it keeps everything organized and prevents any accidental contamination. The filters themselves are compact and easy to handle, perfectly fitting Cuisinart coffee machines without any awkward fiddling.

**Check [Geesta Geesta09] price on Amazon.**  

**Compatibility Across Models**  
These filters work seamlessly with multiple Cuisinart coffee makers, including the Grind & Brew, Burr Grind & Brew, Single Cup Grind & Brew, Programmable, and PerfecTemp series. I‚Äôve personally used them with a Grind & Brew model, and I‚Äôve had zero issues. It‚Äôs reassuring to know they‚Äôre versatile enough to cover the majority of machines in the Cuisinart range, making them a convenient pick for households with multiple coffee makers.

**Enhanced Coffee Taste**  
What truly makes a difference is the impact these filters have on coffee flavor. By effectively reducing impurities, calcium, and chlorine, the filters produce fresher, better-tasting brews. I‚Äôve been able to taste subtle differences in flavor compared to unfiltered water‚Äîit genuinely enhances the aromatic richness of my dark roast coffee beans. Even my husband, who often complains about our hard water, mentioned how smoother his morning coffee tastes now. For tea enthusiasts, it‚Äôs worth noting that the filters improve tea brews too, eliminating any metallic aftertaste.

**Strengths**  
- Improves coffee and tea flavor by reducing impurities  
- Compatible with a wide range of Cuisinart coffee machines  
- Comes with well-sealed individual packaging for freshness  
- Requires replacement only every 60 water tank refills or 2 months  

**Durability and Maintenance**  
One of the areas these filters excel in is longevity. Because they recommend replacing the filter every two months or approximately every 60 water tank refills, I haven‚Äôt felt like I was constantly running out or paying additional costs. This is especially useful for heavy coffee drinkers like myself, where daily or multiple daily brews are standard. The ability to last longer than expected offsets some of the price when compared to other brands.

**Areas of Concern**  
- Not reusable, contributing to more waste compared to permanent options  
- Some filters fit tighter than others, though it doesn‚Äôt majorly affect installation  
- Slightly less effective in extremely hard water areas unless replaced more frequently  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to brands like Keurig charcoal filters or generic multi-machine options, the Geesta filters stand out in terms of compatibility and flavor performance. I‚Äôve tried universal filters before, and while cheaper, they tend to degrade faster and don‚Äôt improve water quality as effectively. Keurig-branded filters balance quality with durability but lack the compatibility for Cuisinart machines, by design. If you‚Äôre committed to premium flavor and your Cuisinart coffee maker, these filters offer a clear edge.

**Value for Money**  
In terms of cost-efficiency, I‚Äôd rank this product favorably. It‚Äôs not the cheapest filter option in the market, but considering its longevity, compatibility, and the noticeable improvement in coffee quality, it offers excellent value. Cheaper alternatives often feel like a compromise, either requiring more frequent replacements or failing to deliver on flavor improvements. Plus, the thoughtful little additions, such as sealed packaging, make the higher price point justifiable.

1mr7ut0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SciFiTime/comments/1mr7ut0/five_humans_abducted_for_a_deadly_alien_reality/,Five Humans Abducted for a Deadly Alien Reality Game,"Mason‚Äôs coffee hit the floor before he did. One second, he was in his kitchen reaching for the creamer. The next, he was gone, as if the floor had dropped out. No sound, no warning. The glass shattered on tile and milk pooled near the refrigerator, but Mason wasn‚Äôt there to see it. Across the world, four others disappeared just as fast, each without fanfare, witnesses, or explanation.

Dr. Evens had just finished rebandaging a wound in a rural clinic when the patient blinked and found the cot empty. Tom√°s dropped his hose mid-yell in New Mexico, where a brushfire had started climbing a ridgeline. Lexi vanished mid-recording, camera still running beside her empty boots. Elijah was at his desk, tapping through lines of code on a half-functional server stack, half-asleep, when his chair spun empty. Five humans were pulled out of their environments without input or delay. Transport wasn‚Äôt loud. It wasn‚Äôt visible. It was exact.

Each woke in isolation. The cells were quiet, uniformly shaped, made of smooth metallic panels with no obvious seams or doors. The light was even and came from no specific source. A small panel on one wall blinked green. Each man stood at different rates, Mason first, already scanning. Evens second, steady, assessing with quick eyes. Tom√°s ran a hand across the wall, then punched it lightly to test response. Elijah didn‚Äôt stand at first but sat up and examined the blinking panel. Lexi simply muttered a profanity and touched his neck, feeling for a pulse that was present but slightly off-rhythm.

A moment later, the walls shimmered, and the front panels went transparent at the same time. They now saw each other, each in identical rooms arranged like wedges around a central hub. There were no doors, but audio initiated through a speaker in the center of each room.

‚ÄúWelcome, new participants. You are contestants in The Trial. Your performance will determine whether your species earns galactic status. Success means survival and recognition. Failure removes you.‚Äù

The voice paused. It was not robotic, but flat and inflectionless, as though auto-translated.

‚ÄúYou have been selected randomly and without permission. Each of you is now fitted with a standard survival index band. This interface will log biological data and performance. Prepare for descent.‚Äù

No questions were allowed. The floor shifted under them. A hum started, followed by a sharp jolt. Then, blackness.

When they opened their eyes again, the setting had changed completely. Gone were the clean rooms. In their place, they now stood on hard, red dirt beneath a wide orange sky. The landscape was uneven, with jagged rock formations, sparse trees that looked brittle and low to the ground, and strange insect-sounds that came from every direction. The temperature was hot, dry, and stable. Each man wore the same clothing he‚Äôd vanished in. A small, black band was now fastened tightly to their left wrists, embedded slightly under the skin, unremovable by inspection.

They did not speak at first. Mason scanned the horizon, then checked each of the others silently. When he was satisfied none were actively dying, he nodded once and motioned them to gather.

‚ÄúAnyone got intel?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúField medic,‚Äù Evens said. ‚ÄúVitals good. No poison or infection signs. Breathing and pulse within baseline ranges.‚Äù

Tom√°s glanced around. ‚ÄúGround‚Äôs volcanic. Cracked in places. Found moisture under rock split. We‚Äôll get water if we dig close to roots.‚Äù

Elijah spoke while fiddling with his wristband. ‚ÄúThis is programmable. Not software I know, but it uses neural feedback to deliver sensor data. I can get it to scan chemical signatures with basic gesture control.‚Äù

Lexi climbed halfway up a sharp incline and shouted down. ‚ÄúClearing north-east. No structures. Saw movement that didn‚Äôt look native, could be mechanical.‚Äù

They gathered on flat rock just off a narrow ravine. Mason looked at each one. ‚ÄúNames. Mason. Navy. Logistics and field command.‚Äù

‚ÄúEvens,‚Äù the medic said.

‚ÄúElijah,‚Äù said the engineer.

‚ÄúTom√°s.‚Äù

‚ÄúLexi. Yeah, I know.‚Äù

Mason squatted on one knee, picked up a piece of loose shale, and drew a quick perimeter in the dirt. ‚ÄúShelter first. Then we find water. We stay in a triangle rotation at all times. No lone movements.‚Äù

Tom√°s had already picked out a cave-like crevice in the rock face. ‚ÄúEast-facing overhang. Partial cover. Good airflow. Close to the water source I found.‚Äù

Evens nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll check fungal growths and scan the local flora. We need to test for basic nutrients, see what won‚Äôt kill us.‚Äù

Lexi dropped a handful of rocks from his climb. ‚ÄúThese were hollowed. Something used this area before. If there were predators, they nested. We‚Äôre being watched.‚Äù

Elijah tapped his wristband again and looked up. ‚ÄúI think I can sync the bands locally. If I‚Äôm right, we‚Äôll be able to send signal pings to each other within two clicks. Maybe more if terrain‚Äôs clear.‚Äù

By nightfall, they had established a perimeter. The shelter was basic, sticks woven through rock crevices, supported by friction locks made from stone grooves. It would hold for temporary use. Water was located ten meters away, from condensation pockets near root clusters. The engineer confirmed its purity. Evens set up a basic triage area with scraped herbs and heat-treated bark. Lexi moved between watch points. Tom√°s reinforced the camp‚Äôs west wall with heavier stones after a light tremor.

They encountered the first predator around dusk. It was quiet, low to the ground, six-legged, with reflective fur and long claws. Lexi spotted it first from his lookout. Instead of yelling, he sent a pulse through the band, a short triple-blink sequence. All others received it. Mason gave the signal for stillness, then hand-motions for positions.

Tom√°s blocked the rear exit. Evens took point with a heated stick soaked in resin. Mason moved right to flank. Elijah recorded its movements and tagged the path it had taken. They didn‚Äôt fight the thing directly. Instead, they led it into a shallow trap, camouflaged pitfall Tom√°s had dug, reinforced with sharpened stone. The creature fell in, thrashed, then stopped moving.

They burned the body. No risks were taken with pathogens.

The band on Mason‚Äôs wrist blinked red. A message appeared.

‚ÄúObjective complete: Basic Survival Assessment. Shelter, hydration, and predator evasion verified.‚Äù

They all looked up at the same time. Their wristbands flashed again.

‚ÄúNext phase: Direct competition. Incoming team: Andari.‚Äù

Tom√°s frowned. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that mean?‚Äù

Elijah had already pulled data from his band‚Äôs cached files. ‚ÄúAndari. They were last cycle‚Äôs winners. Genetically altered. Cybernetic implants. Known for tactical superiority.‚Äù

Lexi scoffed. ‚ÄúSo, they‚Äôre sending ringers.‚Äù

Mason didn‚Äôt reply immediately. He glanced at the night sky. ‚ÄúThen we don‚Äôt camp. We fortify. We dig. We build traps. And we make it look like we‚Äôre running scared.‚Äù

Evens rolled his shoulders. ‚ÄúYou think they‚Äôll chase?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey always do,‚Äù Mason said. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôll be waiting.‚Äù

They moved without needing further instruction. Elijah worked into the night with a dull piece of stone and converted the band‚Äôs projection lens to scan short-range infrared. Lexi mapped the terrain by climbing the ridge three times, creating a topographic model by hand on bark using heated stone. Tom√°s rigged a fire-trigger mechanism with dry twigs and sap, built to flare under sudden pressure. Evens laced the old predator pit with sharper spikes, now tipped with extracted venom from the creature‚Äôs fangs.

They did not rest. They did not argue. They had not chosen to be a team. It didn‚Äôt matter.

The red horizon darkened. Far off in the sky, faint shapes descended. The Andari had arrived.

The Andari entered without subtlety. Their descent left a long burn mark across the northern ridge, which Lexi captured using the optical rangefinder he‚Äôd improvised with a bent strip of metal and the lens from his embedded wristband. There were five of them, all taller than average, each wearing tight black suits with built-in pulse modulators along the spine. Their movements were synchronized and methodical. One scanned the terrain using a mounted wrist projector, while two others activated cloaking fields that shimmered faintly when observed at an angle.

Mason had already pre-positioned the group along a narrow gorge. Tom√°s had reinforced it with two sets of covered pits, each with braced spikes aligned along typical footfall spacing. Elijah‚Äôs jerry-rigged signal scrambler was already cycling interference through localized channels, disabling long-range transmissions within three clicks. Evens waited behind the second trench with a medical pack constructed from harvested plant fibers and a sharp-edged bone splint tied to his forearm. Lexi moved along the higher ridges, dropping gravel in measured intervals to simulate motion in false directions.

The Andari scout team advanced with split formation, clearly anticipating resistance. They took elevation first, scanning for heat signatures. Elijah‚Äôs device had flooded the immediate area with decoy readings, small pings set to body temperature and placed near heat-absorbing rock plates Mason had arranged. Two cloaked Andari moved toward the southern edge, where they encountered a pile of disturbed dirt hiding one of Tom√°s‚Äôs engineered pits. The first fell in with no reaction sound, but the second backtracked too fast and triggered a tripwire that released a cascade of stone debris.

Mason gave a single sharp hand gesture. The team activated preloaded smoke canisters Tom√°s had built by wrapping dried fungus in heat-reactive bark. The smoke released in thick streams, obscuring visual range. Lexi dropped a reflective panel across the ridge, bouncing false light signatures and creating the illusion of multiple retreating figures. The Andari shifted tactics, drawing pulse weapons and aiming blind bursts through the haze.

Tom√°s stepped into range and lifted a heated iron fragment he‚Äôd sharpened to an edge, then threw it hard. The projectile hit one of the Andari squarely in the leg joint, severing balance. Evens darted forward, drove a barbed spear into the same location, then rolled to cover without pause. Mason moved next, flanking the shooter and disarming him with a controlled strike to the wrist followed by a hammering elbow to the jaw. The weapon fell, and Tom√°s kicked it into the pit.

Elijah kept the signal jammer stable, reinforcing interference bands manually. He adjusted frequency modulation to counter the pulse feedback the Andari tried to re-establish. Lexi flagged the remaining hostiles from above, using mirror flashes and hand signals to coordinate positioning. The final two Andari regrouped and activated their cloaks, attempting to vanish.

Mason anticipated it and activated a thermal flare from one of their bait stations. The heat surge overloaded the cloaking systems temporarily, making both targets visible in infrared. Lexi took advantage first, dropping a weighted rock on one‚Äôs shoulder joint, knocking him to his knees. Tom√°s tackled the other from behind and used a restraint cord he‚Äôd made from twisted bark fibers, tying the arms in one motion.

Evens checked pulse, oxygen levels, and responsiveness on the injured Andari. The one still conscious looked directly at Mason and spoke in standard Galactic. ‚ÄúThis was not expected.‚Äù

Mason gave a short nod. ‚ÄúWe get that a lot.‚Äù

The encounter ended with two Andari dead, two injured, and one restrained. The humans remained mobile, with minor bruises and a shallow cut on Tom√°s‚Äôs forearm. Evens disinfected it with sap and pressure-wrapped it. Elijah scanned the remaining Andari tech and isolated a communication device embedded in their armor lining. After fifteen minutes of interface probing, he gained access to a secure comms loop between the Andari squad and their Valari producers.

He patched the signal through the team‚Äôs bands using a localized translator codec. The first message played was from a Valari controller. ‚ÄúUnit status failure detected. Recalculate engagement metrics. Proceed to next elimination team if recovery fails.‚Äù

Lexi frowned. ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre getting more.‚Äù

Elijah replayed another segment, this one encrypted with higher-tier authorization. After re-routing the signal processing through his band‚Äôs micro-integration port, he pulled up another set of logs. These outlined the purpose of The Trial in dry, procedural language. Species that failed were removed from lists of development viability. The population data suggested forced relocation or systemic elimination. Language used in internal memos referred to ‚Äúentertainment value,‚Äù ‚Äúsponsor satisfaction,‚Äù and ‚Äúcost-effective replacement cycles.‚Äù

Mason reviewed the files in silence, then looked around. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a game show. It‚Äôs extermination with lights.‚Äù

Tom√°s cracked his knuckles. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the counter-program?‚Äù

Evens closed his med kit and stood. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no rescue coming. And they‚Äôre watching to see if we break or quit.‚Äù

Lexi leaned back against a rock wall. ‚ÄúOr sell out like good pets. We go home, but Earth gets tagged next.‚Äù

For a minute, no one said anything. The only sound came from a distant screech, animal, maybe. Elijah looked up from the decrypted feed. ‚ÄúWe can trace where the main signal‚Äôs broadcast. It‚Äôs directional, aimed low, and masked by terrain. Closest matching angle and interference zone is under that mountain bluff.‚Äù

Mason turned toward the slope he‚Äôd already studied during their first day. ‚ÄúMakes sense. Terrain hides energy signatures. They don‚Äôt expect us to think upstream.‚Äù

Tom√°s picked up an Andari blade. ‚ÄúSo we take the show backstage.‚Äù

Evens rechecked his supplies, counted remaining adhesive strips and unbroken splints. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need infiltration cover. Disguises. Gear.‚Äù

Elijah gestured to the disabled suits. ‚ÄúThese have automated readouts. I can spoof the return signature with thirty minutes of firmware injection. They‚Äôll think we‚Äôre wounded returnees.‚Äù

Lexi grinned and shrugged. ‚ÄúWorst they can do is kill us. Already planned for that.‚Äù

They worked fast. Evens removed the Andari gear and cut it into modular parts. Lexi wore one suit, adjusted for his frame using tightly wrapped cordage and heat-molded straps. Mason and Tom√°s fit the remaining usable armor, painting over biometric fields with ash and dirt to blur readings. Elijah embedded a redirect protocol into the comms unit, masking their approach and logging a fake distress signal that would be auto-accepted by the production system.

They burned the remaining gear, buried the bodies, and marked the graves with stacked stones to prevent native scavengers from digging. No one made a speech. Mason gave them an ETA of two hours to reach the cliffside by nightfall. They moved with practiced silence, following Lexi‚Äôs mapped ridge route.

Halfway up, they encountered a sensor node, a floating surveillance drone the size of a melon. Elijah used a heat spike from his wristband to overload the visual core, frying the internals without setting off a noise alarm. Evens watched the blinking lights die, then rejoined formation without speaking. Tom√°s slipped twice on the shale surface but caught himself both times.

By the time they reached the mountain‚Äôs ledge, the outer lights of the Valari station glowed faint through heat-diffusing panels. The entrance bay was recessed behind a curtain of camouflaged rock, with three visible sentries pacing in a predictable pattern. Mason scoped the layout and ran through movement timing twice before nodding once. Elijah whispered the entry code he had pulled from the Andari logs. It matched the drop-ship identifier already faked in their bands.

No one celebrated. There was no plan B.

They entered the facility under the cover of darkness, carrying a stretcher made from one of the Andari armor shells, painted with injury tags. The two sentries scanned their codes, paused briefly, then waved them through with no additional questions.

Inside, the lights were sterile again. No heat. No color variation. Just white corridors, automated rail transport lines, and maintenance drones that ignored them completely. Lexi glanced once toward the internal broadcast monitors. None of the screens showed live feeds. Only countdowns.

The Trial wasn‚Äôt being watched in real time. It was being edited. Pre-packaged.

Mason looked back at the others. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go show them a live feed.‚Äù

The entry corridor split after thirty meters, with one route leading toward what appeared to be a medical recovery zone and the other dropping into a wider tunnel marked by Valari script. Lexi walked ahead while scanning each intersection for active sensor nodes. Elijah tracked the power lines running along the upper corners of the corridor and noted the thickest cables ran down toward the lower route. That implied primary systems were below, likely the central server hub or broadcast control. Tom√°s adjusted the strap of the repurposed Andari armor and stayed rear guard.

The interior layout didn‚Äôt follow any recognizable military or civilian facility logic. The corridors looped into one another and shifted width with no consistent measurements, which Elijah guessed was a visual deterrent or internal scrambling design. He checked the signal direction using a passive echo function on the repurposed comms unit. It bounced back a tight range from the central shaft down the tunnel. Mason gave the go signal with a simple hand gesture and moved forward.

Security presence increased as they reached the lower level. Evens counted four uniformed Valari, armed with shock staves and light armor. Their patrol patterns were wide but timed with clear start-stop delays every eleven seconds. Lexi moved during the pause and disabled the rear-most guard with a short strike to the base of the skull. Tom√°s pulled the body aside and stripped the ID band for Elijah. The engineer patched it into their spoofed entry codes and expanded access to the adjacent maintenance node.

From there, Elijah identified the hub‚Äôs broadcast chamber, located on sublevel two. It was protected by two biometric locks and a continuous identity confirmation system that required a rotating login cycle. Instead of bypassing it, he piggybacked their false status onto a recovery access tag from the Andari‚Äôs last failed retrieval request. The automated protocols accepted the signal without challenge.

The broadcast chamber doors opened slowly, revealing a circular room lined with data pillars and suspended display orbs. At the center stood the master control column, surrounded by holographic panels that showed multiple trial arenas in playback loops. All feeds were delayed. None were live. Lexi uploaded the external camera footage he had pulled from their first days on the planet, raw, uncut files showing the predator traps, the Andari ambush, and the decrypted producer messages.

Mason and Tom√°s moved to secure the door behind them while Evens began setting up a basic barricade with fallen drone pieces. Elijah plugged into the main column and initiated a full data dump into the open loop channel. The system hesitated but accepted the command after he manually reclassified their account authority using an old Valari override string embedded in the Andari gear‚Äôs recovery database.

The first signal went out across the system. One screen at a time, sectors lit up as the footage uploaded itself directly into public relay stations used by sponsor networks. The team watched as the display orbs began to show real-time protests from off-world viewports. Lexi kept rotating the footage, switching between scenes of unaltered survival attempts, execution clips, and archived internal memos that named species marked for removal.

Valari command finally responded after eight minutes. A group of six armed guards entered from the north corridor, immediately engaging. Tom√°s dropped two with cover fire using a pulse rifle taken from the Andari. Mason moved forward and struck the third in the neck with a hard, downward elbow, followed by a sweep to take his feet out. Evens pulled the wounded behind a data pillar and administered rapid stabilizer injections where needed.

Elijah accelerated the upload by rerouting unused processing bandwidth from the entertainment analytics server. Lexi redirected the internal camera feeds so the broadcast now looped the humans‚Äô live feed in place of the scheduled programming. Across the viewing species‚Äô networks, images changed from scripted trial footage to direct shots of Valari personnel dragging prisoners, controlling implants, and running simulations that tracked extinction probabilities by entertainment value.

Security reinforcements arrived, but the team held the control center. Mason and Tom√°s forced back the second wave with timed suppressive bursts and angled mirror distractions. Evens managed to keep Lexi mobile after a pulse round grazed his left leg. The vlogger tied a support wrap and returned to camera control, keeping the signal active. Elijah reached the end of the upload. The emergency transmission burst initiated, jumping the footage to thirty-three open galactic data exchanges.

The room went silent after the final confirmation screen blinked green. Mason looked around the control center. The lights dimmed, then a red warning strip activated across every monitor. The main console shut down automatically. They had used every access point the system allowed.

Movement echoed from the main corridor. Mason took a position near the inner doorway while Lexi limped behind cover. The figure who stepped into the room wasn‚Äôt armed. It was a Valari executive, four-limbed, tall, dressed in layered black uniform with an embedded translator and a data wand across one wrist. He did not raise his hands or step back. He simply spoke in clear Standard.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve broken a protocol shared across forty-eight sectors.‚Äù

Mason replied without adjusting stance. ‚ÄúThen you should update your sectors.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou believe you‚Äôve exposed something?‚Äù the Valari asked, moving one step forward.

Tom√°s raised the pulse weapon. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt believe. We filmed it.‚Äù

Evens checked Lexi‚Äôs leg again, applying a coolant patch to slow the tissue heat spread. Lexi winced but stayed quiet. Elijah backed up the core data onto a secondary Valari pad in case of transmission cutoff.

The Valari stepped fully into the room. ‚ÄúSurrender. We‚Äôll process your return and isolate Earth until compliance is assured.‚Äù

Mason shook his head once. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still assuming we play by your structure.‚Äù

The executive paused. ‚ÄúThen what is your intention?‚Äù

Mason looked to the camera and spoke toward the lens. ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt invited. So we took over the show.‚Äù

Tom√°s triggered the remote auto-detonation device he had wired into the back entrance‚Äôs support panel. The resulting collapse sealed the room. They moved fast, rerouting through a side corridor Elijah had unlocked using a cross-access maintenance grid. It led to the launch bay, where two docked Valari patrol ships were still running idle power cycles.

They entered the second one. Elijah interfaced the navigation directly into the control panel. Lexi dropped into the comms seat and began sending out open-loop identifiers marked ‚ÄúHuman Origin Broadcast Confirmed.‚Äù Evens ran internal checks to ensure no biological tags were active. Mason took the pilot seat and fired the thrusters.

The ship rose through the surface tunnel, breaching into open air. There was no resistance. Valari control had gone dark after the footage hit the external networks. Dozens of vessels from nearby systems had begun transmitting unauthorized connections, spreading the data archive manually. Mason set a jump vector to Earth space, locked in the course, and hit full acceleration.

Three months later, Earth received them in orbit. The ship docked with a new orbital station that hadn‚Äôt existed when they were taken. It had been built from hastily unified designs, integrating parts from over sixteen species. The footage had caused riots. Protests in more than twenty-three systems had forced shutdown of every Trial arena. Over a dozen Valari executives were under tribunal arrest.

The five were now labeled as official contacts for humanity‚Äôs first interspecies cooperation mandate. They didn‚Äôt call themselves heroes. Mason now instructed interstellar logistics in tactical schools. Evens developed standardized field kits for alien physiology. Tom√°s oversaw terrain readiness for survival instructors on new colonies. Lexi taught remote mobility and information gathering using cheap field gear. Elijah was in charge of reverse-engineering Trial tech for civilian use.

No one broadcasted Trials anymore. The networks had all gone off-air. The galaxy now watched something else.

Married? Then Stop Having ‚ÄúClose Friends‚Äù of the Opposite Sex, You‚Äôre Playing with Fire


I honestly think they are either na√Øve or slow minded but yeah opposite sex friendships damage relationships and marriages more often than not. The statistics are available for anyone to see and look at.. it‚Äôs not rocket science.. I just can‚Äôt believe this is not common sense. 


 -Over half of extramarital affairs begin with close friends.

U.S. data shows that 53.5% of extramarital sexual contacts were with someone the married person knew well, often a close friend, while another 29.4% involved acquaintances like coworkers or neighbors. 



‚Ä¢	One-on-one opposite-sex friendships can pose risks.
Meetings like regular coffee dates, gym sessions, texting, or late-night chats provide fertile ground for emotional or sexual attachment‚Äîsometimes rivaling what exists in a marriage. 

Your wife or husband having bestfriends of the opposite sex is a disaster, this is not normal it leads to distrust, jealousy, sometimes cheating and complications. Even if you trust your spouse would you really trust that other person to not turn them against you?

I don‚Äôt care what they have to say all I know is what Allah put as rules, we keep on debating them as young na√Øve teenagers and then after years pass and we watch how things turn out, we wish we obeyed since the beginning..

Allah knows best. Protect your marriages, no friends of the opposite sex are allowed in islam and this is a reminder.

One second, he was in his kitchen reaching for the creamer. The next, he was gone, as if the floor had dropped out. No sound, no warning. The glass shattered on tile and milk pooled near the refrigerator, but Mason wasn‚Äôt there to see it. Across the world, four others disappeared just as fast, each without fanfare, witnesses, or explanation.

Dr. Evens had just finished rebandaging a wound in a rural clinic when the patient blinked and found the cot empty. Tom√°s dropped his hose mid-yell in New Mexico, where a brushfire had started climbing a ridgeline. Lexi vanished mid-recording, camera still running beside her empty boots. Elijah was at his desk, tapping through lines of code on a half-functional server stack, half-asleep, when his chair spun empty. Five humans were pulled out of their environments without input or delay. Transport wasn‚Äôt loud. It wasn‚Äôt visible. It was exact.

Each woke in isolation. The cells were quiet, uniformly shaped, made of smooth metallic panels with no obvious seams or doors. The light was even and came from no specific source. A small panel on one wall blinked green. Each man stood at different rates, Mason first, already scanning. Evens second, steady, assessing with quick eyes. Tom√°s ran a hand across the wall, then punched it lightly to test response. Elijah didn‚Äôt stand at first but sat up and examined the blinking panel. Lexi simply muttered a profanity and touched his neck, feeling for a pulse that was present but slightly off-rhythm.

A moment later, the walls shimmered, and the front panels went transparent at the same time. They now saw each other, each in identical rooms arranged like wedges around a central hub. There were no doors, but audio initiated through a speaker in the center of each room.

‚ÄúWelcome, new participants. You are contestants in The Trial. Your performance will determine whether your species earns galactic status. Success means survival and recognition. Failure removes you.‚Äù

The voice paused. It was not robotic, but flat and inflectionless, as though auto-translated.

‚ÄúYou have been selected randomly and without permission. Each of you is now fitted with a standard survival index band. This interface will log biological data and performance. Prepare for descent.‚Äù

No questions were allowed. The floor shifted under them. A hum started, followed by a sharp jolt. Then, blackness.

When they opened their eyes again, the setting had changed completely. Gone were the clean rooms. In their place, they now stood on hard, red dirt beneath a wide orange sky. The landscape was uneven, with jagged rock formations, sparse trees that looked brittle and low to the ground, and strange insect-sounds that came from every direction. The temperature was hot, dry, and stable. Each man wore the same clothing he‚Äôd vanished in. A small, black band was now fastened tightly to their left wrists, embedded slightly under the skin, unremovable by inspection.

They did not speak at first. Mason scanned the horizon, then checked each of the others silently. When he was satisfied none were actively dying, he nodded once and motioned them to gather.

‚ÄúAnyone got intel?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúField medic,‚Äù Evens said. ‚ÄúVitals good. No poison or infection signs. Breathing and pulse within baseline ranges.‚Äù

Tom√°s glanced around. ‚ÄúGround‚Äôs volcanic. Cracked in places. Found moisture under rock split. We‚Äôll get water if we dig close to roots.‚Äù

Elijah spoke while fiddling with his wristband. ‚ÄúThis is programmable. Not software I know, but it uses neural feedback to deliver sensor data. I can get it to scan chemical signatures with basic gesture control.‚Äù

Lexi climbed halfway up a sharp incline and shouted down. ‚ÄúClearing north-east. No structures. Saw movement that didn‚Äôt look native, could be mechanical.‚Äù

They gathered on flat rock just off a narrow ravine. Mason looked at each one. ‚ÄúNames. Mason. Navy. Logistics and field command.‚Äù

‚ÄúEvens,‚Äù the medic said.

‚ÄúElijah,‚Äù said the engineer.

‚ÄúTom√°s.‚Äù

‚ÄúLexi. Yeah, I know.‚Äù

Mason squatted on one knee, picked up a piece of loose shale, and drew a quick perimeter in the dirt. ‚ÄúShelter first. Then we find water. We stay in a triangle rotation at all times. No lone movements.‚Äù

Tom√°s had already picked out a cave-like crevice in the rock face. ‚ÄúEast-facing overhang. Partial cover. Good airflow. Close to the water source I found.‚Äù

Evens nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll check fungal growths and scan the local flora. We need to test for basic nutrients, see what won‚Äôt kill us.‚Äù

Lexi dropped a handful of rocks from his climb. ‚ÄúThese were hollowed. Something used this area before. If there were predators, they nested. We‚Äôre being watched.‚Äù

Elijah tapped his wristband again and looked up. ‚ÄúI think I can sync the bands locally. If I‚Äôm right, we‚Äôll be able to send signal pings to each other within two clicks. Maybe more if terrain‚Äôs clear.‚Äù

By nightfall, they had established a perimeter. The shelter was basic, sticks woven through rock crevices, supported by friction locks made from stone grooves. It would hold for temporary use. Water was located ten meters away, from condensation pockets near root clusters. The engineer confirmed its purity. Evens set up a basic triage area with scraped herbs and heat-treated bark. Lexi moved between watch points. Tom√°s reinforced the camp‚Äôs west wall with heavier stones after a light tremor.

They encountered the first predator around dusk. It was quiet, low to the ground, six-legged, with reflective fur and long claws. Lexi spotted it first from his lookout. Instead of yelling, he sent a pulse through the band, a short triple-blink sequence. All others received it. Mason gave the signal for stillness, then hand-motions for positions.

Tom√°s blocked the rear exit. Evens took point with a heated stick soaked in resin. Mason moved right to flank. Elijah recorded its movements and tagged the path it had taken. They didn‚Äôt fight the thing directly. Instead, they led it into a shallow trap, camouflaged pitfall Tom√°s had dug, reinforced with sharpened stone. The creature fell in, thrashed, then stopped moving.

They burned the body. No risks were taken with pathogens.

The band on Mason‚Äôs wrist blinked red. A message appeared.

‚ÄúObjective complete: Basic Survival Assessment. Shelter, hydration, and predator evasion verified.‚Äù

They all looked up at the same time. Their wristbands flashed again.

‚ÄúNext phase: Direct competition. Incoming team: Andari.‚Äù

Tom√°s frowned. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that mean?‚Äù

Elijah had already pulled data from his band‚Äôs cached files. ‚ÄúAndari. They were last cycle‚Äôs winners. Genetically altered. Cybernetic implants. Known for tactical superiority.‚Äù

Lexi scoffed. ‚ÄúSo, they‚Äôre sending ringers.‚Äù

Mason didn‚Äôt reply immediately. He glanced at the night sky. ‚ÄúThen we don‚Äôt camp. We fortify. We dig. We build traps. And we make it look like we‚Äôre running scared.‚Äù

Evens rolled his shoulders. ‚ÄúYou think they‚Äôll chase?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey always do,‚Äù Mason said. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôll be waiting.‚Äù

They moved without needing further instruction. Elijah worked into the night with a dull piece of stone and converted the band‚Äôs projection lens to scan short-range infrared. Lexi mapped the terrain by climbing the ridge three times, creating a topographic model by hand on bark using heated stone. Tom√°s rigged a fire-trigger mechanism with dry twigs and sap, built to flare under sudden pressure. Evens laced the old predator pit with sharper spikes, now tipped with extracted venom from the creature‚Äôs fangs.

They did not rest. They did not argue. They had not chosen to be a team. It didn‚Äôt matter.

The red horizon darkened. Far off in the sky, faint shapes descended. The Andari had arrived.

The Andari entered without subtlety. Their descent left a long burn mark across the northern ridge, which Lexi captured using the optical rangefinder he‚Äôd improvised with a bent strip of metal and the lens from his embedded wristband. There were five of them, all taller than average, each wearing tight black suits with built-in pulse modulators along the spine. Their movements were synchronized and methodical. One scanned the terrain using a mounted wrist projector, while two others activated cloaking fields that shimmered faintly when observed at an angle.

Mason had already pre-positioned the group along a narrow gorge. Tom√°s had reinforced it with two sets of covered pits, each with braced spikes aligned along typical footfall spacing. Elijah‚Äôs jerry-rigged signal scrambler was already cycling interference through localized channels, disabling long-range transmissions within three clicks. Evens waited behind the second trench with a medical pack constructed from harvested plant fibers and a sharp-edged bone splint tied to his forearm. Lexi moved along the higher ridges, dropping gravel in measured intervals to simulate motion in false directions.

The Andari scout team advanced with split formation, clearly anticipating resistance. They took elevation first, scanning for heat signatures. Elijah‚Äôs device had flooded the immediate area with decoy readings, small pings set to body temperature and placed near heat-absorbing rock plates Mason had arranged. Two cloaked Andari moved toward the southern edge, where they encountered a pile of disturbed dirt hiding one of Tom√°s‚Äôs engineered pits. The first fell in with no reaction sound, but the second backtracked too fast and triggered a tripwire that released a cascade of stone debris.

Mason gave a single sharp hand gesture. The team activated preloaded smoke canisters Tom√°s had built by wrapping dried fungus in heat-reactive bark. The smoke released in thick streams, obscuring visual range. Lexi dropped a reflective panel across the ridge, bouncing false light signatures and creating the illusion of multiple retreating figures. The Andari shifted tactics, drawing pulse weapons and aiming blind bursts through the haze.

Tom√°s stepped into range and lifted a heated iron fragment he‚Äôd sharpened to an edge, then threw it hard. The projectile hit one of the Andari squarely in the leg joint, severing balance. Evens darted forward, drove a barbed spear into the same location, then rolled to cover without pause. Mason moved next, flanking the shooter and disarming him with a controlled strike to the wrist followed by a hammering elbow to the jaw. The weapon fell, and Tom√°s kicked it into the pit.

Elijah kept the signal jammer stable, reinforcing interference bands manually. He adjusted frequency modulation to counter the pulse feedback the Andari tried to re-establish. Lexi flagged the remaining hostiles from above, using mirror flashes and hand signals to coordinate positioning. The final two Andari regrouped and activated their cloaks, attempting to vanish.

Mason anticipated it and activated a thermal flare from one of their bait stations. The heat surge overloaded the cloaking systems temporarily, making both targets visible in infrared. Lexi took advantage first, dropping a weighted rock on one‚Äôs shoulder joint, knocking him to his knees. Tom√°s tackled the other from behind and used a restraint cord he‚Äôd made from twisted bark fibers, tying the arms in one motion.

Evens checked pulse, oxygen levels, and responsiveness on the injured Andari. The one still conscious looked directly at Mason and spoke in standard Galactic. ‚ÄúThis was not expected.‚Äù

Mason gave a short nod. ‚ÄúWe get that a lot.‚Äù

The encounter ended with two Andari dead, two injured, and one restrained. The humans remained mobile, with minor bruises and a shallow cut on Tom√°s‚Äôs forearm. Evens disinfected it with sap and pressure-wrapped it. Elijah scanned the remaining Andari tech and isolated a communication device embedded in their armor lining. After fifteen minutes of interface probing, he gained access to a secure comms loop between the Andari squad and their Valari producers.

He patched the signal through the team‚Äôs bands using a localized translator codec. The first message played was from a Valari controller. ‚ÄúUnit status failure detected. Recalculate engagement metrics. Proceed to next elimination team if recovery fails.‚Äù

Lexi frowned. ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre getting more.‚Äù

Elijah replayed another segment, this one encrypted with higher-tier authorization. After re-routing the signal processing through his band‚Äôs micro-integration port, he pulled up another set of logs. These outlined the purpose of The Trial in dry, procedural language. Species that failed were removed from lists of development viability. The population data suggested forced relocation or systemic elimination. Language used in internal memos referred to ‚Äúentertainment value,‚Äù ‚Äúsponsor satisfaction,‚Äù and ‚Äúcost-effective replacement cycles.‚Äù

Mason reviewed the files in silence, then looked around. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a game show. It‚Äôs extermination with lights.‚Äù

Tom√°s cracked his knuckles. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the counter-program?‚Äù

Evens closed his med kit and stood. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no rescue coming. And they‚Äôre watching to see if we break or quit.‚Äù

Lexi leaned back against a rock wall. ‚ÄúOr sell out like good pets. We go home, but Earth gets tagged next.‚Äù

For a minute, no one said anything. The only sound came from a distant screech, animal, maybe. Elijah looked up from the decrypted feed. ‚ÄúWe can trace where the main signal‚Äôs broadcast. It‚Äôs directional, aimed low, and masked by terrain. Closest matching angle and interference zone is under that mountain bluff.‚Äù

Mason turned toward the slope he‚Äôd already studied during their first day. ‚ÄúMakes sense. Terrain hides energy signatures. They don‚Äôt expect us to think upstream.‚Äù

Tom√°s picked up an Andari blade. ‚ÄúSo we take the show backstage.‚Äù

Evens rechecked his supplies, counted remaining adhesive strips and unbroken splints. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need infiltration cover. Disguises. Gear.‚Äù

Elijah gestured to the disabled suits. ‚ÄúThese have automated readouts. I can spoof the return signature with thirty minutes of firmware injection. They‚Äôll think we‚Äôre wounded returnees.‚Äù

Lexi grinned and shrugged. ‚ÄúWorst they can do is kill us. Already planned for that.‚Äù

They worked fast. Evens removed the Andari gear and cut it into modular parts. Lexi wore one suit, adjusted for his frame using tightly wrapped cordage and heat-molded straps. Mason and Tom√°s fit the remaining usable armor, painting over biometric fields with ash and dirt to blur readings. Elijah embedded a redirect protocol into the comms unit, masking their approach and logging a fake distress signal that would be auto-accepted by the production system.

They burned the remaining gear, buried the bodies, and marked the graves with stacked stones to prevent native scavengers from digging. No one made a speech. Mason gave them an ETA of two hours to reach the cliffside by nightfall. They moved with practiced silence, following Lexi‚Äôs mapped ridge route.

Halfway up, they encountered a sensor node, a floating surveillance drone the size of a melon. Elijah used a heat spike from his wristband to overload the visual core, frying the internals without setting off a noise alarm. Evens watched the blinking lights die, then rejoined formation without speaking. Tom√°s slipped twice on the shale surface but caught himself both times.

By the time they reached the mountain‚Äôs ledge, the outer lights of the Valari station glowed faint through heat-diffusing panels. The entrance bay was recessed behind a curtain of camouflaged rock, with three visible sentries pacing in a predictable pattern. Mason scoped the layout and ran through movement timing twice before nodding once. Elijah whispered the entry code he had pulled from the Andari logs. It matched the drop-ship identifier already faked in their bands.

No one celebrated. There was no plan B.

They entered the facility under the cover of darkness, carrying a stretcher made from one of the Andari armor shells, painted with injury tags. The two sentries scanned their codes, paused briefly, then waved them through with no additional questions.

Inside, the lights were sterile again. No heat. No color variation. Just white corridors, automated rail transport lines, and maintenance drones that ignored them completely. Lexi glanced once toward the internal broadcast monitors. None of the screens showed live feeds. Only countdowns.

The Trial wasn‚Äôt being watched in real time. It was being edited. Pre-packaged.

Mason looked back at the others. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go show them a live feed.‚Äù

The entry corridor split after thirty meters, with one route leading toward what appeared to be a medical recovery zone and the other dropping into a wider tunnel marked by Valari script. Lexi walked ahead while scanning each intersection for active sensor nodes. Elijah tracked the power lines running along the upper corners of the corridor and noted the thickest cables ran down toward the lower route. That implied primary systems were below, likely the central server hub or broadcast control. Tom√°s adjusted the strap of the repurposed Andari armor and stayed rear guard.

The interior layout didn‚Äôt follow any recognizable military or civilian facility logic. The corridors looped into one another and shifted width with no consistent measurements, which Elijah guessed was a visual deterrent or internal scrambling design. He checked the signal direction using a passive echo function on the repurposed comms unit. It bounced back a tight range from the central shaft down the tunnel. Mason gave the go signal with a simple hand gesture and moved forward.

Security presence increased as they reached the lower level. Evens counted four uniformed Valari, armed with shock staves and light armor. Their patrol patterns were wide but timed with clear start-stop delays every eleven seconds. Lexi moved during the pause and disabled the rear-most guard with a short strike to the base of the skull. Tom√°s pulled the body aside and stripped the ID band for Elijah. The engineer patched it into their spoofed entry codes and expanded access to the adjacent maintenance node.

From there, Elijah identified the hub‚Äôs broadcast chamber, located on sublevel two. It was protected by two biometric locks and a continuous identity confirmation system that required a rotating login cycle. Instead of bypassing it, he piggybacked their false status onto a recovery access tag from the Andari‚Äôs last failed retrieval request. The automated protocols accepted the signal without challenge.

The broadcast chamber doors opened slowly, revealing a circular room lined with data pillars and suspended display orbs. At the center stood the master control column, surrounded by holographic panels that showed multiple trial arenas in playback loops. All feeds were delayed. None were live. Lexi uploaded the external camera footage he had pulled from their first days on the planet, raw, uncut files showing the predator traps, the Andari ambush, and the decrypted producer messages.

Mason and Tom√°s moved to secure the door behind them while Evens began setting up a basic barricade with fallen drone pieces. Elijah plugged into the main column and initiated a full data dump into the open loop channel. The system hesitated but accepted the command after he manually reclassified their account authority using an old Valari override string embedded in the Andari gear‚Äôs recovery database.

The first signal went out across the system. One screen at a time, sectors lit up as the footage uploaded itself directly into public relay stations used by sponsor networks. The team watched as the display orbs began to show real-time protests from off-world viewports. Lexi kept rotating the footage, switching between scenes of unaltered survival attempts, execution clips, and archived internal memos that named species marked for removal.

Valari command finally responded after eight minutes. A group of six armed guards entered from the north corridor, immediately engaging. Tom√°s dropped two with cover fire using a pulse rifle taken from the Andari. Mason moved forward and struck the third in the neck with a hard, downward elbow, followed by a sweep to take his feet out. Evens pulled the wounded behind a data pillar and administered rapid stabilizer injections where needed.

Elijah accelerated the upload by rerouting unused processing bandwidth from the entertainment analytics server. Lexi redirected the internal camera feeds so the broadcast now looped the humans‚Äô live feed in place of the scheduled programming. Across the viewing species‚Äô networks, images changed from scripted trial footage to direct shots of Valari personnel dragging prisoners, controlling implants, and running simulations that tracked extinction probabilities by entertainment value.

Security reinforcements arrived, but the team held the control center. Mason and Tom√°s forced back the second wave with timed suppressive bursts and angled mirror distractions. Evens managed to keep Lexi mobile after a pulse round grazed his left leg. The vlogger tied a support wrap and returned to camera control, keeping the signal active. Elijah reached the end of the upload. The emergency transmission burst initiated, jumping the footage to thirty-three open galactic data exchanges.

The room went silent after the final confirmation screen blinked green. Mason looked around the control center. The lights dimmed, then a red warning strip activated across every monitor. The main console shut down automatically. They had used every access point the system allowed.

Movement echoed from the main corridor. Mason took a position near the inner doorway while Lexi limped behind cover. The figure who stepped into the room wasn‚Äôt armed. It was a Valari executive, four-limbed, tall, dressed in layered black uniform with an embedded translator and a data wand across one wrist. He did not raise his hands or step back. He simply spoke in clear Standard.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve broken a protocol shared across forty-eight sectors.‚Äù

Mason replied without adjusting stance. ‚ÄúThen you should update your sectors.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou believe you‚Äôve exposed something?‚Äù the Valari asked, moving one step forward.

Tom√°s raised the pulse weapon. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt believe. We filmed it.‚Äù

Evens checked Lexi‚Äôs leg again, applying a coolant patch to slow the tissue heat spread. Lexi winced but stayed quiet. Elijah backed up the core data onto a secondary Valari pad in case of transmission cutoff.

The Valari stepped fully into the room. ‚ÄúSurrender. We‚Äôll process your return and isolate Earth until compliance is assured.‚Äù

Mason shook his head once. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still assuming we play by your structure.‚Äù

The executive paused. ‚ÄúThen what is your intention?‚Äù

Mason looked to the camera and spoke toward the lens. ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt invited. So we took over the show.‚Äù

Tom√°s triggered the remote auto-detonation device he had wired into the back entrance‚Äôs support panel. The resulting collapse sealed the room. They moved fast, rerouting through a side corridor Elijah had unlocked using a cross-access maintenance grid. It led to the launch bay, where two docked Valari patrol ships were still running idle power cycles.

They entered the second one. Elijah interfaced the navigation directly into the control panel. Lexi dropped into the comms seat and began sending out open-loop identifiers marked ‚ÄúHuman Origin Broadcast Confirmed.‚Äù Evens ran internal checks to ensure no biological tags were active. Mason took the pilot seat and fired the thrusters.

The ship rose through the surface tunnel, breaching into open air. There was no resistance. Valari control had gone dark after the footage hit the external networks. Dozens of vessels from nearby systems had begun transmitting unauthorized connections, spreading the data archive manually. Mason set a jump vector to Earth space, locked in the course, and hit full acceleration.

Three months later, Earth received them in orbit. The ship docked with a new orbital station that hadn‚Äôt existed when they were taken. It had been built from hastily unified designs, integrating parts from over sixteen species. The footage had caused riots. Protests in more than twenty-three systems had forced shutdown of every Trial arena. Over a dozen Valari executives were under tribunal arrest.

The five were now labeled as official contacts for humanity‚Äôs first interspecies cooperation mandate. They didn‚Äôt call themselves heroes. Mason now instructed interstellar logistics in tactical schools. Evens developed standardized field kits for alien physiology. Tom√°s oversaw terrain readiness for survival instructors on new colonies. Lexi taught remote mobility and information gathering using cheap field gear. Elijah was in charge of reverse-engineering Trial tech for civilian use.

No one broadcasted Trials anymore. The networks had all gone off-air. The galaxy now watched something else.

1mr7sm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mr7sm6/rules_for_the_thrumming/,Rules for ‚ÄòThe Thrumming.‚Äô,"Houses, like people, have their own little quirks. Personalities. Even two houses with an identical floor plan will eventually gain their own unique details, like twins. These quirks of the home become just another part of the day- the light that only turns on when you hit the wall just right, the shower that freezes your bones with one unfortunate toilet flush- you get it. At worst, these quirks may be annoying, sometimes costly to fix, but other times, some would argue they build character. So what if I told you a home could get a malignant quirk? Sounds ridiculous, right? I thought so too. But with what I‚Äôve encountered these past few months, and the body on my bathroom floor right now, I‚Äôd be ignorant to say that my house doesn‚Äôt have something deeply wrong with it. Let me explain.

My wife Linda and I were tired of renting apartments. We were potentially wanting to start a family. So after a few years of saving, it was time to look for that dream home of ours. We loaded up into the sedan, ready to visit a few houses that caught our eye, when my wife uttered the worst sentence I could imagine: ‚ÄúYou ready to drive over to my mother's?‚Äù

Okay, listen to me. I know it‚Äôs clich√© to hate your mother-in-law. I get it. Here‚Äôs the thing: I don‚Äôt care. I hate Ruth. The less I talk about her, the lower my blood pressure gets. Unfortunately, she‚Äôs a really good Realtor, so it only makes sense to go with her to help secure a house. It really doesn‚Äôt help when you live in a small city either- there‚Äôs not a lot of options, y‚Äôknow? I still wasn‚Äôt happy with the choice. She sticks her nose into all of our business and absolutely hates everything about me. She once tried to get my wife to break up with me for a random cashier. *Seven years into our relationship.* That woman‚Äôs never seen a day beyond misery, but my wife insists that she remains in our lives, and because I love my wife, I hold my tongue. I only wish Ruth would hold hers.

So, we pulled up to Ruth‚Äôs house, and of course, she‚Äôs wearing her finest scowl, which only deepens when she makes eye contact with me. She took her time to enter the backseat.

My wife beamed at her, trying to lighten the mood. ‚ÄúHey, mom! We have about three houses we wanted to look at. Is that still the plan for today?‚Äù

Ruth nodded approvingly. ‚ÄúYes, dear. I want to make sure you don‚Äôt choose a house in some run-down neighborhood. You can never be too careful these days- they‚Äôll sell you a house with a painted tarp for a roof.‚Äù

‚ÄúRuth.‚Äù I cleared my throat and acknowledged her presence. Her demeanor shifted immediately.

‚ÄúSamuel.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre radiant today.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late.‚Äù

My wife‚Äôs hand on my leg told me I couldn‚Äôt fire back with whatever I was going to say, so I didn‚Äôt, and instead made the decision to get the car in gear over to the first house. We pulled up to a 3-bed, 2-bathroom home, with a freshly maintained lawn and a new coat of dazzling white paint. Touring the place, it seemed fine enough, until Ruth explained there were 8 offers on the house already. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs practically already sold, ‚Äô were her words. The second place was technically a steal for the price, even though it was a little bit of a fixer-upper, though Ruth just *had* to chime in.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too much work for Samuel. You‚Äôre gonna be swimming in half-finished projects, in a half-finished house.‚Äù She scoffed, placing herself in the back seat.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unsalvageable, Ruth. With a little bit of time, I could probably-‚Äù

‚ÄúYou said the same thing about painting your living room. That took you, what, several months?‚Äù

My hands instinctively went to pinch between my eyes. ‚ÄúWe had to get permission from our landlord. On top of that,¬†¬†*I broke my leg.‚Äù*

She threw her hands up, focusing on my wife. ‚ÄúAll I‚Äôm saying is that if he couldn‚Äôt paint some walls, I don‚Äôt have high hopes for that one.‚Äù Whether she was referring to the home or me, I couldn‚Äôt tell.

The last house was a further drive from the rest. As the suburb gave way to nature, Ruth filled us in.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not so sure about this one, but I know Linda‚Äôs tastes. The owner seems very old-school; he says he wants to be a part of the whole process. He‚Äôll be giving us a tour of the house.‚Äù She squinted through her glasses to look at her notes. ‚ÄúClearly there must be something wrong with it- it‚Äôs way under market.‚Äù

Eventually, we found ourselves at the house, nestled snug in a blanket of trees. Though simple in design, looking at the weather vane on the roof and the rocking chair on the porch, my wife and I could tell this home had character. We were admiring the outside knick-knacks when an older gentleman stepped out from the front door. His appearance reminded me of an old sheriff character straight from a western- his mustache wiggled as he spoke.

‚ÄúYou here to take a look around?‚Äù His voice carried a roughness tempered by experience.

‚ÄúYes, sir. You the owner?‚Äù I held my hand out to shake his.

He nodded, and reciprocated. ‚ÄúYessir. Been the owner for about 25 years, give or take.‚Äù

He invited the three of us into a home that was probably cozy in another lifetime. Two gaudy recliners sat in front of an old CRT TV in a conversation pit. A deer‚Äôs head was mounted above the fireplace, staring vacantly across the room. A shag rug dominated most of the living room territory. No one had informed this household that the 1970s were over. From the looks of it, no one had cleaned since the 70s either: A thick layer of dust coated just about everything. Normally, most people would take one look at a place like this in disgust and turn on their heel out the door. My wife and I, however, had weird tastes. By the glimmer in my wife‚Äôs eyes, I could tell she loved the aesthetic just as much as I did. Ruth was too busy sneering at a family of ceramic ducks on a shelf to voice her distaste. We were all jostled to life by the owner when he cleared his throat.

‚ÄúKitchen‚Äôs this way. Hope you like yellow.‚Äù

Well, to simply say the kitchen was yellow would be like describing Godzilla as ‚Äòa pretty big lizard‚Äô. Wood cabinets, yellow countertops, and floral tile- this house could‚Äôve been a set for a sitcom just switching over to color TV. Despite its age, however, and the apparent lack of cleanliness, what surprised us was how well *maintained* it appeared. Not a door hinge out of place, not a speck of rust. My wife inspected each angle of every piece of furniture, a basset hound searching for something amiss.

‚ÄúI love the aesthetic in here. It‚Äôs a beautiful home.‚Äù She cooed, running a hand along the fridge.

‚ÄúYou can thank my wife for it. She refused to change a thing about this house, and, well‚Ä¶ I just couldn‚Äôt either when...‚Äù His sentence died out as the man stared out the window just above the sink, into the woods.

It‚Äôs a little awkward to console a person you know nothing about, but I tried my hand at it anyway.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about your loss.‚Äù

He simply shrugged. ‚ÄúBound to happen eventually. Just wish it would‚Äôve been me, not her.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt sure what to say to that, and for once, I was glad to see Ruth as she stepped into the kitchen. She stifled a gag. ‚ÄúUgh. Horrendous.‚Äù

With each room we saw, my wife and I fell further in love with the home. Both bedrooms and the backyard carried the same energy as the rest of the place- a vignette of better days, waiting for another chance to be filled with happiness. Towards the end, however, the man presented the oddities of the house that, at the time, I looked over. How was I supposed to know this gift horse was a Trojan horse?

‚ÄúHouse only got one shower.‚Äù He swung open the guest bathroom, revealing simply a toilet, sink, and cabinet. I mistook the fear in his voice for reluctance to admit a flaw in the house.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not necessarily a deal breaker for us, right, Sam?‚Äù My wife didn‚Äôt seem phased either.

I shook my head. ‚ÄúNah, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a problem. We‚Äôll manage.‚Äù

The owner looked at me solemnly. ‚ÄúI hope you do. C‚Äômon, let me show you what you‚Äôd be working with.‚Äù He stiffly moved his way toward the main bathroom, leading us down the hall. He opened the door and motioned for us to take a look inside.

Red.

Each wall and floor tile was a deep, reddish-orange hue. The sink cabinets, toilet, and shower (with tub) were pea green. I‚Äôd been vibing with the retro look up to this point, but something about this bathroom didn‚Äôt feel great. Linda and I stared at the vibrant mess of the room before exchanging a glance at each other. Our eyebrows communicated what we were thinking: *Remodel.* We turned to face the owner, who made no attempt to step a single inch into the door frame. He had a thousand-yard stare, keeping his eyes on the shower at all times.

‚ÄúSo, how many offers?‚Äù I asked, snapping the man out of a daze.

‚ÄúNone yet.‚Äù He scratched his stark white mustache, and the wrinkles on his forehead multiplied with the furrowing of his brow in thought.

On cue, Ruth spoke up. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not serious-‚Äù

‚ÄúMom, please.‚Äù Linda stuck her hand out to shush Ruth. I couldn‚Äôt help but smile.

That afternoon, we sat at his dining table and worked out our offer. The man seemed more than pleased with what he was getting, which worked for me, as I was willing to go a lot higher for what he was offering; he was planning on leaving the place fully furnished. ‚ÄòThey won‚Äôt let me take it to assisted living,‚Äô was his explanation. The rest of the process was quick. With all inspections passed with flying colors, we had all the papers signed and sealed by the end of the week, ready to move in that weekend.

That Saturday, we rented a mini trailer for all the stuff we wanted to keep, and left what we didn‚Äôt want, as a ‚Äòpay it forward‚Äô to the next tenant. Our excitement was contagious on the drive away from our apartment complex, despite knowing we were on our way to Ruth‚Äôs house to pick up the keys. In true Ruth fashion, when she handed us the keys, she didn‚Äôt decide on a ‚ÄúCongratulations‚Äù or an ‚ÄúEnjoy your new home‚Äù, instead opting to give us one last piece of her mind. ‚ÄúI think you could‚Äôve done better.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, Ruth.‚Äù I nodded, taking the keys from her. ‚ÄúLinda will text you when we get there!‚Äù We peeled out of her driveway, smiling and waving as her grimace trailed out of sight. Next stop: home sweet home.

It was near dusk by the time we reached our isolated new digs, the last rays of sun stretching frantically above the forest as they sank below the treeline. We stood at the threshold of the front door and unlocked it for the first time.

‚ÄúWelcome home, Sam.‚Äù

‚ÄúWelcome home, Linda.‚Äù

We began moving boxes inside, filling up the closet with things to sort through the next day. Passing by the kitchen, I spotted a piece of paper out of place, taped to the countertop. I picked up the note and read it, unaware just how much my life would change from that moment on. It read:

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Rules for ‚ÄòThe Thrumming.‚Äô

Hello Sam and Linda. You seem like good people, but I couldn‚Äôt wait much longer, so I had to go with whoever showed up first. I‚Äôm sorry. I hope you‚Äôll forgive me. It was nothing personal.

There‚Äôs something wrong with this house. Something lives here. Marie, my wife, called it ‚ÄòThe Thrumming‚Äô because of the noise it makes. It came with the house all those years ago, and it‚Äôs been around for a long, long time. I‚Äôm going to give you the same rules I was given, in hopes it keeps you safe. Under no circumstances should you break these rules. I‚Äôve seen what happens. Martha made one little slip-up, one mistake in old age, and now it‚Äôs just me. I‚Äôm getting old. Getting tired. Couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. Maybe you‚Äôll be the one to find a way to stop this thing.

Rule 1: From ten seconds after the shower is turned on until ten seconds after the shower is turned off, ***do not open your eyes.*** You need to keep your eyes closed, so you don‚Äôt see it. You‚Äôll know when it‚Äôs watching you.

Rule 2: When showering, only one person should be in the bathroom. More people means more chances of someone breaking the rules.

Rule 3: When showering, keep the bathroom door locked, so no one accidentally walks in and sees it.

Rule 4: ***Ignore what it says to you.*** It will only get better at tempting you to open your eyes. Don‚Äôt.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

I reread the message twice. *What a weird, sick joke. I never took the old guy to be the type,* I thought. I heard Linda come up behind me with a bag of groceries. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that? Did he leave us a housewarming message?‚Äù The curiosity was clear in her voice.

‚ÄúYes. Very sweet. Hannibal Lecter would be tickled pink.‚Äù I handed her the note and watched her face shift into a myriad of expressions, landing on confusion.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù She handed me back the note.

I shrugged. ‚ÄúWeird old guy. I feel sorry for him.‚Äù I tucked the note into my pocket, and we continued to unpack our car. We didn‚Äôt dwell too much on the strange note. It wasn‚Äôt until Linda went to bed, and I went to take a shower, that I thought of it again. Standing on the blood-orange colored tiles, staring at the shower, I hesitated, only to immediately be embarrassed by my hesitation.

‚ÄúPoor guy was just confused.‚Äù I tried to reassure myself. My hands fumbled with the shower knob, turning it on. I couldn‚Äôt help but count.

One Mississippi.

Two Mississippi.

Three Mississippi.

The water warmed up just enough for me to step inside.

Four Mississippi.

Five Mississippi.

Six Mississippi.

I looked around the room. It was a normal room. *Nothing‚Äôs going to happen,* I thought to myself.

Seven Mississippi.

Eight Mississippi.

I admit, I closed my eyes. I just felt like I had to. I‚Äôm so glad I did.

Nine Mississippi.

Ten-

Something shifted in the light of my closed eyelid, and then I heard it. Immediately, I understood why they called it The Thrumming.

Let me do my best to describe what I heard. First, close your eyes. While your eyes are closed, clench your inner ear muscles. It should sound like a constant, vibrating, pulsing hum in your head. Like far-off thunder, nestled in your brain. That‚Äôs what The Thrumming sounds like. I was so startled by the noise, I almost threw my eyes open. I don‚Äôt know how I didn‚Äôt. I had no idea what to do- I could feel something standing right outside of the shower. It was big- I could tell a lot of light was being blocked. I could feel it heaving, a cold gust breaking through the warmth of the shower in a rhythmic breathing motion. I scrambled to turn off the shower, and I counted again. At ten Mississippi, the rumbling stopped, the breathing stopped, and the shape blocking the light in my closed eyes was no longer there. I waited another ten seconds to be safe before opening my eyes.

Nothing. No footprints, no sign of the door ever being unlocked. The room looked exactly as it did when I entered it. I sprinted to my sleeping wife, not even bothering to grab a towel, and woke her up.

‚ÄúLinda- get up, we gotta go.‚Äù I hissed, shaking her.

She shot up, grumbling, wiping the sleep from her eyes. ‚ÄúWhat? Sam, what are you-‚Äù She glanced at my disheveled state. ‚Äú...what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat creepy note about the shower? Yeah. It‚Äôs real. We need to go.‚Äù I haphazardly threw a shirt on backwards as I hopped on one foot into a pair of jeans.

‚ÄúVery funny, Sam. Can I go back to sleep?‚Äù She yawned, resting her head back on the pillow.

I shook her awake again, sitting her up in the bed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, it‚Äôs real. C‚Äômon, I‚Äôll prove it.‚Äù She followed me to the door of the bathroom, grumbling the entire time. ‚ÄúOkay, go in there, turn the shower on, and close your eyes. Don‚Äôt open them.‚Äù I reiterate.

‚ÄúOnce I do this, *then* can I go to sleep?‚Äù She stretched.

‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt want to. Remember, keep your eyes closed. Ten seconds after the shower‚Äôs on, to ten seconds after the shower‚Äôs off.‚Äù I closed the door immediately when she entered the bathroom. I heard the water turn on. Nearly ten seconds of water running, I heard one of Linda‚Äôs yawns pitch into a squeak of surprise. Nearly immediately, the water turned off. About fifteen seconds later, there was a scramble of footsteps, before she threw open the door, pale as a ghost.

‚ÄúWhat was that?!‚Äù She was wide awake.

‚ÄúI think we just met The Thrumming.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, so what do we do?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd go where?! Stay at a hotel? What if it follows us? *Can* it follow us?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

We sat in the living room, jumping at every noise, for the rest of the night. But nothing came to get us. No creature lumbered its way from the bathroom. No masked psycho burst from the closet. The only noise was the gradual birdsong from the forest outside, as the dawn peeked through the windows.

Our first move was to try to get a hold of the previous homeowner, but it was like he vanished into thin air. We tried every old folks home, assisted living place, and hospital in a wide radius, but none had a patient who matched his name. Next, we contacted Ruth.

‚ÄúRuth, we need to put the house back on the market. There‚Äôs a lot wrong with it. Termites. Holes in the roof. The water heater‚Äôs about to explode.‚Äù I threw every lie I could out there.

I could hear her smile stretch on the other side of the phone. ‚ÄúBut Samuel- the inspections came back fine. If you don‚Äôt like the look of the house, it‚Äôs alright to admit it. After all, I *did* try to warn you, didn‚Äôt I? But no one listens to me.‚Äù

I wanted to slam my head against the wall. ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not that, Ruth. There are just a lot of things that we don‚Äôt like about this house. Can‚Äôt you help us out?‚Äù

There was a pause. ‚ÄúSamuel, maybe you just need to give it some time. If you still feel this way after a few months-‚Äù

I hung up on her. We didn‚Äôt have the funds for staying at a hotel for the long term, along with making payments on our new mortgage, so we were forced to live with it. For a month, we would take turns taking showers, and every time, we would hear The Thrumming in our heads, mixing with the water running down our spines. We could feel its presence, smell its breath- a boiled egg left in the sun for three days, garnishing a glass of curdled milk and sardine juice. We followed every rule- we kept our eyes closed, showered alone, and kept the door locked. We didn‚Äôt fully understand rule four yet.

That changed.

I had just come back home from a jog, catching Linda on the way out for groceries. She kissed me on the cheek, and I watched her pull out of the driveway, heading down toward the road. I made my way over to the bathroom to wash the layer of sweat that I was wearing like a coat. My new shower ritual started like normal- water on, close eyes, hop in. I‚Äôd gotten better at feeling around for the soap and hair wash, though it was still tough to fully ignore The Thrumming.

Out of the bathroom, I heard the crashing of glass. Then, Linda‚Äôs voice:

‚ÄúShoot! Sam, I need your help! This vase got me good, I‚Äôm bleeding!‚Äù

Panicked about how badly she may have hurt herself, I was about to open my eyes to turn off the shower and quickly grab my clothes, when I stopped.

*I just saw Linda drive off.*

‚ÄúSam? Sam, please, it‚Äôs pretty bad. I need a towel or something.‚Äù It continued to speak, just like how my wife would when she‚Äôs afraid.

Slowly, I resumed my shower, and the frightened voice outside dissolved into the Thrumming noise, back in my skull.

We had to be more careful from that day on. Knocks on the window, voices in the home, and sounds of missed calls were occasionally sprinkled in to our shower sessions. The Thrumming was doing whatever it could to get us to take one little peek. As awful as it sounds, it became the new normal. Linda and I became good at blocking any distractions, focusing on our shower thoughts more than anything else. We tried not to think about how much worse it could get, or how much longer we‚Äôd have to deal with it. Instead, our focus was on research, trying to see if anyone else had dealt with a situation like this. We were in the middle of looking for exorcists in our local area when my wife got a frantic call from her mother.

Apparently, Ruth got into an argument at a local restaurant. She decided to use some‚Ä¶ choice words towards a young waitress, and what‚Äôs worse, this ‚Äòinteraction‚Äô was recorded by several bystanders.

‚ÄúLinda, I don‚Äôt feel safe in my own home anymore! The whole community has it out for me!‚Äù Her harpy screech tore through the phone's speaker.

I mimed playing the world‚Äôs smallest violin, grinning ear to ear. Linda glared daggers at me before speaking. ‚ÄúWell, Mom, I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that, but I don‚Äôt know what you want us to do about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I just need to get away for a bit. Let this all blow over. You got a spare bedroom there, right?‚Äù

My smile was obliterated. I shook my head vehemently, mouthing ‚ÄúNo no no no no no-‚Äù

‚ÄúMom, that‚Äôs asking a lot‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI know it is, dear, but listen. You still want to sell that house? Let me stay with you for a bit, and I promise, I‚Äôll get that house back on the market for you, and get you as close to what you bought it for as possible.‚Äù

Linda and I stared at each other. I could tell we were on the same wavelength- *this could be it. If we let Ruth stay with us for a week or two, maybe she could even see what we‚Äôre dealing with. She could help get us out of here.*

‚ÄúAlright, deal. Come on over, we‚Äôll get the guest bedroom ready for you.‚Äù

In the time it took her to come over, we ran through the game plan multiple times on how we‚Äôd try to explain what‚Äôs going on in the house. We were as confident as we were going to be when we heard the knock on our door.

I opened the door for her. ‚ÄúHey Ruth, come on in-‚Äù

She pushed me aside, her hands full of two suitcases, packed to the brim. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt eaten yet. Did you have dinner yet? Get a pot of coffee started for me.‚Äù She ordered, dropping her suitcases with a thud.

‚ÄúRuth, before all that, can we-‚Äù

‚ÄúLINDA? Linda where-‚Äù she spotted Linda sitting in the conversation pit. ‚ÄúOh, there you are. Get these suitcases unpacked for me, will you? It‚Äôs been such a rough day, I just want to eat, shower, and rest.‚Äù

Our eyes grew wide at the word *shower.*

‚ÄúMom, about that, can you come sit for a second? We need to talk to you about-‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, hun, we‚Äôll have plenty of time to talk after I‚Äôve eaten and freshened up-‚Äù

My wife rose from her seat and pointed at the chair next to her. ‚ÄúMOM. We need to talk NOW, or I'll throw your suitcases into the forest. Now SIT.‚Äù I‚Äôve never heard her talk to her mother like that, but desperate times call for desperate measures, I guess.

There was a moment where Ruth seemed stunned, before she resumed her normal, miserable demeanor.

‚ÄúAlright, alright, dear. You don‚Äôt have to talk to me like that. I‚Äôm not a child. We‚Äôre all adults here.‚Äù She placed herself gingerly on the couch. I was biting my tongue so hard, I felt like I nearly tore it off.

Linda took the lead. ‚ÄúMom, this house may be...haunted. Or cursed. We‚Äôre not quite sure. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Point is- there‚Äôs something bad with us here. We‚Äôve been following some rules given to us by the previous owner, and it‚Äôs the only thing keeping us alive.‚Äù She pulled out the original note and handed it to Ruth, who was abnormally silent. Her eyes swept the small paper, line by line. Finally, she spoke.

‚ÄúDo you take me for some sort of idiot?‚Äù She snarled, throwing the paper at Linda. ‚ÄúYou have to make up some dumb monster because you‚Äôre too much of a coward to say you don‚Äôt want me here?‚Äù

‚ÄúRuth, enough-‚Äù

She wheeled her attention my way, pointing a finger at me. ‚ÄúShut your mouth! It was probably *YOUR* idea, wasn‚Äôt it? You good for nothing waste of SPACE! The worst day of my life was the day you married Linda!‚Äù She couldn‚Äôt spew the vitriol fast enough from her mouth. She stood, fists balled, face red.

‚ÄúMom, enough! We‚Äôre telling the truth!‚Äù We both stood, watching her move with a purpose down the hallway.

‚ÄúYeah? I‚Äôll be the judge of that! When nothing happens, I‚Äôll be on my way, so you don‚Äôt have to deal with me ever again!‚Äù Rage echoed alongside her footsteps as she threw the bathroom door open.

‚ÄúMOM, NO, WAIT!‚Äù Linda cried. I grabbed her before she could chase after her.

‚ÄúLinda, no, we can‚Äôt go in there.‚Äù I held her in place, facing her away from the bathroom.

My gut lurched when I heard the shower turn on.

One Mississippi.

‚ÄúShut your eyes, Linda. Quick!‚Äù I tried to console her, as we both knew what was coming.

Two Mississippi.

Three Mississippi.

Ruth‚Äôs boisterous voice echoed from the small bathroom. ‚ÄúWHERE‚ÄôS THE 'THUMBING', HUH? I DON‚ÄôT SEE IT. IS IT SHY?‚Äù

Four Mississippi.

Five Mississippi.

I just held Linda in my arms, as she sobbed, already mourning the loss of her mother.

Six Mississippi.

Seven Mississippi.

I looked down the hall, into the bathroom, where Ruth stood yelling. A tiny part of me thought even someone like her didn‚Äôt deserve whatever was about to happen.

Eight Mississippi.

Nine Mississippi.

I turned and shut my eyes.

‚ÄúYOU MAKE ME SICK, YOU UNGRATEFUL-‚Äù

Ten Mississippi.

Ruth‚Äôs rage-filled ramblings instantly became soul-piercing screams. I‚Äôve never heard a human make those noises before. Shrieks of mortal terror so loud I could hear her vocal chords tearing, squelched by the gurgle of what I assumed was blood. Wet ripping sounds echoed down the hallway, punctuated by the heavy thud of something heavy hitting the ground. Linda and I sat in each other‚Äôs arms for some time before I began to crawl on my hands and knees towards the bathroom, eyes still shut. I needed to turn off the shower.

I could feel the transition from carpet to cold tile, and as I moved forward, a warm liquid coated my hands. I followed the noise of the running water, ignoring the reverberating hum in my head. My hands bumped into something on the floor, and I recoiled immediately, knowing exactly who I just made contact with. I awkwardly lifted myself up onto the edge of the tub and blindly groped the wall, finding the shower handle, and turning it off with a whining hiss. I waited in that room until The Thrumming was long gone. I won‚Äôt describe to you what was left of Ruth.

So, that‚Äôs where we are now. With all that‚Äôs just gone on, Linda and I have decided to put our only plan left in action, which is why I‚Äôm writing this. We weren‚Äôt looking for priests before Ruth arrived. We were planning this post. Whoever you are, you‚Äôre probably a good person, but Linda and I can‚Äôt handle this much longer, so I had to go with whoever reads this first. I‚Äôm sorry. I hope you‚Äôll forgive me. It‚Äôs nothing personal.

So I‚Äôve hidden a rule from you. Our guess is that maybe whatever this thing is, it may not be tied to the house. I think the only reason it‚Äôs stayed here is because the old couple before us never broke rule 5. It makes sense- had they broken rule 5 back in their day, the whole town would‚Äôve come after them. The townspeople would‚Äôve known who told them. But in this day and age, on the internet? Anonymity has its perks. So if my theory is correct, you might buy us some time, or maybe even make it leave us alone. In fairness, however, I want to give you the rules one more time. All of them.

Rule 1: From ten seconds after the shower is turned on until ten seconds after the shower is turned off, ***do not open your eyes.*** You need to keep your eyes closed, so you don‚Äôt see it. You‚Äôll know when it‚Äôs watching you.

Rule 2: When showering, only one person should be in the bathroom. More people means more chances of someone breaking the rules.

Rule 3: When showering, keep the bathroom door locked, so no one accidentally walks in and sees it.

Rule 4: ***Ignore what it says to you.*** It will only get better at tempting you to open your eyes. Don‚Äôt.

Rule 5: Do not tell anyone about this thing. The secret needs to stay with you, in this house. Don't let it get out.",3,1755286221.0,creepcast,1,0.8,False

1mr7nmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/spinalfusion/comments/1mr7nmh/2472_hrs_post_acdf_surgery/,24-72 hrs POST ACDF surgery,"Before my ACDF surgery, I was pretty terrified. I took great comfort in many of the positive videos and posts online. Just wanting to pass it forward, It‚Äôs 48 hours since my C5-C7 ACDF surgery. On day one, a few hours post surgery. I had a little stiffness, not much pain- I‚Äôm sure that was due to aggressive pain management. As the anesthesia fully wore off I noticed some achiness in the back of my neck (like a stiff neck) and shoulders. My throat felt a bit sore like when you have a cold. I was able to swallow my meds but with a little difficulty. I had some broth and jello. My voice was pretty normal. Not much swelling. The next morning at 18hrs post, I graduated to pudding and juice. After meeting with PT and OT I was discharged home at 24hrs post and had some pastina and scrambled eggs for dinner. At 48 hours post, the only pain I have is still back of the neck and left shoulder. It‚Äôs an aching pain, not sharp. It‚Äôs completely bearable -except when trying to sleep. Today, 72hrs post, For breakfast I had coffee, a corn muffin and fruit smoothie. For dinner I‚Äôm planning on pasta. I‚Äôm pretty confident I can return to a normal diet tomorrow. I was given a soft collar, but was assured it was for my comfort and I could take it on and off as needed. as far as pain meds, I‚Äôve taken some in the morning and before bedtime, but I feel I‚Äôm at the point where they can be discontinued in the next day or so.

All in all, this was a much easier experience than I anticipated. I know everyone heals differently, and of course, there are risks inherent in any surgery. but I just want to tell people who are facing this that the most important thing is to find a surgeon with good experience who you feel confident with as well as a institution that does a good number of spinal surgeries with positive outcomes.

So anyways.

This is the reality check about girls. If it isn't a reality check for you because you already know it, pretend you hear some applause.

(I would have added some clapping emojis but haha. :(. This device doesn't want me to.)

\------

Not all girls are pilates princesses - some actually lift, run - some girls don't see an interest in achieving a certain 'attractive' look that apparently appeals to the opposite gender and have no intention to work towards it.  
Not all of them drink iced coffee, some hate it (actually that percentage that do hate it is remarkably low but still).  
Some don't like makeup and dressing in revealing clothing - some are fine in joggers and a big shirt that has mickey mouse on it.  
Some like to huddle in toilets as a group and gossip - others don't.  
Some like to gossip out of the toilets too - some don't.  
Some organise sleepovers to discuss boys - others do it to binge on food.  
Some obsess over calories and losing weight - some don't respectfully give a damn and are more obsessed with trying the newest Crumbl (yeah that is not me because I don't live in the US but I wish). Or Olive Garden or the Cheesecake Factory or Little Caesar's (also another reality check I haven't been to any of these places (i live in england ughh) so yeah you can just imagine me dreaming about them).  
Some want to become an influencer, others want to be a vet, or an investor, or an entrepreneur.  
Some love art, others love PE, other love maths, or economics, or philosophy.  
Some like to watch romantic shows where the girl swoons over the guy for a year before he realises, but bam, she's lost hope and found another guy and he needs to win her back (admittedly with some brooding) and others can watch detective shows and Star Wars or the Avengers. Some can love both.

OMG AND BIGGEST MISCONCEPTION IS THAT GIRLS EAT SLOW. NOT ALL DO. SOME LITERALLY FINISH BEFORE THEIR MALE FRIENDS OF THE SAME AGE. CAN YOU GUESS WHO BY THE CAPS? HONESTLY EVERYONE THINKS GIRLS ARE SNAILS IN THE REALM OF EATING BUT SOME OF US ARE HUNGRY TOO.

This whole saga started when I got this Room and Board couch. My old couch was a lighter fabric U-sectional that took up the room and balanced the black bookshelves/console/tv better. What I'm struggling with:

\- the couch is staying  
\- the ottoman can go/can be subbed for MCM coffee table  
\- the accent chair color works in my head, but I think it's too bottom heavy?  
\- the rug was an attempt to tie the accent chair + couch together.

I know the chaotic pillows/ottoman color are throwing things, but I would love assistance in deciding if the chair is worth it (\~$500 genuine leather I found at Homegoods), or if I should sub for a more classic MCM wood-heavy chair (potentially lighter in color, like white upholstery?) Also, would love assistance in determining if the rug should stay if the accent chair changes colors.

1mr7hxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1mr7hxi/should_the_best_countertop_blender_be_the_vitamix/,Should the best countertop blender be the Vitamix E310 Explorian,"Testing out the Vitamix VM0197 blender has been quite an adventure in my kitchen. As someone who enjoys experimenting with recipes, from silky smoothies to heartier soups, I found this model to be a capable and versatile kitchen ally. It‚Äôs a professional-grade blender, and you can tell right from the first use that it‚Äôs built to last. While it certainly holds many positives, there are some aspects to weigh before committing to it.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of this blender is straightforward yet functional. Its black finish gives it a sleek, professional vibe, and the compact size of the 48-ounce container makes it a good fit for smaller countertops. It‚Äôs not a lightweight machine, though; at 10.5 pounds, it feels incredibly sturdy, which reassures me of its durability. The motor base feels solid, and the radial cooling fan paired with a thermal protection system ensures the blender stays in good condition even after extended use. That said, the height of about 18 inches can make storage a bit tricky for tight kitchen spaces.

**Ease of Use**  
Using this blender is pretty intuitive. The variable speed control knob offers ten speeds, ranging from gentle mixing to full-on blending, allowing for remarkable precision. I‚Äôve made everything from chunky salsas to creamy soups, layering textures with its pulse feature for heartier recipes. Whether emulsifying dressings or grinding coffee, the controls are straightforward enough for any skill level. Cleaning, too, is a highlight. Just add warm water, a drop of dish soap, and run it on high speed‚Äîit practically scrubs itself in under a minute. No disassembly is required, which I hugely appreciate.  

[Check Vitamix VM0197 price on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b0758jhzm3/)  

**Performance and Versatility**  
Where this blender really shines is in its power and versatility. The performance is fueled by its hardened stainless-steel blades that cut through anything from frozen berries to dense nuts with ease. The first time I used it to make nut butter, I was amazed at how smoothly it blended everything, leaving no chunks behind. I even explored its capability to prepare hot soups straight in the container. It blends at high enough speeds to create steam, which is convenient for quick meals. The machine consistently delivers smooth, consistent results whether you‚Äôre making smoothies, dough, or even homemade ice cream.

**Winning Points**  
- Variable speed control for precision blending  
- Durable stainless-steel blades handle tough ingredients effectively  
- Self-cleaning feature saves significant time and effort  
- Compact 48-ounce container suits small batch recipes perfectly  
- Robust build quality with radial cooling fan and thermal protection  

**Negatives**  
- Hefty dimensions make it hard to fit in smaller cupboards  
- Can be slightly noisier than expected when blending harder ingredients  
- Pricier than some other countertop blenders  

**Competing Options**  
Comparing this model to others on the market highlights where it excels. For instance, I‚Äôve tried blending with less expensive models like the Ninja Professional Blender. While it delivers decent results for everyday smoothies, it often struggles with thicker blends such as nut butters or frozen desserts. Another contender, the Blendtec Total Blender, is similarly priced but outmatched by the Vitamix VM0197 in terms of longevity and motor base durability. Where the Blendtec might overheat from heavy use, this Vitamix unit holds its ground thanks to its cooling system. That said, some competitors like the Breville Super Q Blender are quieter, making them a more attractive option for quieter households, albeit at an even steeper investment.

**Worth Every Penny**  
This model certainly leans on the premium side of countertop blenders, but it fully justifies the price point for what it offers. The durability and performance make it an excellent long-term investment, especially for serious home cooks who regularly push their kitchen appliances to the limit. After all, why settle for cheaper options that might break down within a year when you can have something built to last and consistently deliver top-notch results? The five-year warranty also gives peace of mind, covering parts, labor, and even shipping costs.

The neighbours are an elderly couple in their 80s, with two adult daughters in their 40s.

The dude is an alcoholic. He used to maintain the garden for the previous owners for about 30+ years (mostly irrigation). Also his irrigation water comes through my property once a month. So he has waltzed into my garden on a number of occasions, excusing himself that he needs to check the irrigation channels, even though there is a local guy here whose job is to do exactly that. I have told drunken neighbour that he is not allowed access without prior consent from me, but he fails to respect that. Last February he went in again. Me and my friends told him to never enter again and escorted him out, luckily his wife and daughter saw what happened and scolded him. My property is hard to secure but I have managed to do it since February. 

Two weeks ago he entered my house without permission. Drunk as fck, of course. The entrance door to the first floor was open due to ongoing construction work and I caught him red handed in there. I told him to get the fck out and to never enter my property again. Instead of reporting him to the police for trespassing, I had my lawyer send him a cease and desist letter, which referred earlier trespassing, and was pretty explicit. I did that to give the neighbours the opportunity to sort it out without the police, as that escalates things. He'd likely be prosecuted for trespassing, since I have many previous documented cases. 

The neighbor and one daughter has now gone to the town hall to try to report me for illegal construction work (didnt work, all permits are in order). They also reported me to the irrigation comittee because I refuse to have him access my garden (didnt work either). Tee hee. He has now started to take pictures of my property from his property, also of the people I have visiting and working for me. Which pissed them off, one local guy even said he'd beat him up if he took one more picture of him. Well. Apparently my neighbour has a very bad reputation in town and everyone talks shit about him. I judge people from how they behave towards me. I'm not impressed but the wife and the daughters are nice people and I sympathise with them. 

I recently learned that the container outside my house has caused my neighbour some distress, not only dur to the dust and the noise, but the fact that - euuugh - some of the contractors have used the container to dump their ""biohazardous materials"". (I offered them the use of my downstairs toilet, they politely declined, so I thought they did their business on their coffee and lunch breaks in the bar across the street. Apparently not.) The street is downhill so the biohazardous materials leaked out of the container and passed their house by their entrance door. I can understand why that is upsetting and apparently they have had to clean the street outside their house on a few occasions. They never said anything to me or the construction guys, whom they know (this is a small town). 

I am wondering what to do. My instincts tell me I should take responsibility for the container issues, and give them a piece offering and an apology for the container trouble and the noise etc from construction. Like a nice packet of smoked salmon and a bottle of drink. However my friends say I don't owe the asshole a thing and I should not give him anything, as it would give the wrong signal. I am now beginning to agree with my friends, but I need some outside opinions.

AITA if I ignore the issues from the container and leave the relationship to rot?

1mr7bhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/weyler/comments/1mr7bhb/tyler_and_wednesday_theory_part_two_relationship/,Tyler and Wednesday Theory Part Two! (Relationship?),"I think many of you have already seen the trailer, and I believe you've seen the theory about Wednesday becoming Tyler's master, but I haven't seen a full post about it yet. So I decided to make one!

https://preview.redd.it/osdc5yboi8jf1.png?width=545&format=png&auto=webp&s=d58f8e91231bed9eddc62b7785cf37edd636c40b

Let's start with the fact that the idea has already been presented behind the scenes by Jenna and Tyler themselves. In an interview, Jenna says that ""it would be really, REALLY interesting if Wednesday had a monster as a pet,"" and Tyler says he ""would do that for Jenna."" The two have shown agreement on this relationship between their characters, which is new considering Jenna's previous positions.

https://preview.redd.it/uel9htzcf8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ba9855d98f21f08a8f30749b347595321ec6844

In the second episode of season 2, where Tyler and Wednesday reunite after the events of season 1, Tyler finds himself handcuffed with a shock collar around his neck. He pulls on the handcuffs to approach the bars and talk to Wednesday.

https://preview.redd.it/to39ganqi8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e7a367eb2a10d5dc5301652a9f9c89ed775760d

The scene cuts to Wednesday showing a slight smile; Perhaps pleased to see him locked up after everything he's done, but also out of personal preference...?

https://preview.redd.it/691a95qef8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=03d0898659dc6291f1e347015955a1df491730c6

Then we have the dialogue ""You sensed the monster in me, and you fell in love with it,"" a statement made by Tyler that Wednesday doesn't deny. Here we see that she's not attracted to, much less likes, the criminal acts Hyde committed, but rather his dangerous existence itself. That's what attracted Wednesday, even if unconsciously.

We even get this confirmation in Episode 7 of Season 1, when Wednesday discovers that Tyler is Hyde after kissing him in the coffee shop, running away while saying, ""Of course my first kiss would be with a psychopathic serial killer monster. I think it's my type.""

https://preview.redd.it/l15fv7ahf8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee8189640860334ff92ec39154b583b2396ed870

Back in Season 2, we have Episode 4, when Wednesday rescues Fester from the asylum and ends up releasing all the patients as a result, including Tyler. In the final scene, he appears transformed, running down the hallway toward her. She tells the woman she rescued to run ahead of her, staying behind as she watches him approach.

Here we see a look of fear, anxiety, curiosity...? We don't know exactly. But she stands there until he stops in front of her.

https://preview.redd.it/ceahle6si8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d51e221808b37c8c01c4c7c23bc3f18de239ca96

This is where it gets really strange, because they stare at each other for several seconds, and then the scene cuts to outside. The question here isn't whether he threw her out the window or not;

Why did she stand still if she knew she was in danger?

I believe that for a moment, she believed he wouldn't hurt her, and he also hesitated for a moment when he saw her. The exchange of glances, as if they were both waiting for something, is quite strange.

But I believe this is where Wednesday saw something about Tyler, even though he was transformed into a monster. Which leads to her wanting to save him in Part 2.

https://preview.redd.it/sgnxnjmti8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a18f8f5c4e7aebede0f1ce61365dac77508e43d

From here on, we have information from the trailer.

We have a conversation between Wednesday and Enid, where Wednesday talks about Tyler being on the loose and wanting to kill them both. That she could fix it.

Later, we have the phrase ""a life hangs in the balance,"" which is contradictory, since they would both be at risk... unless they aren't as much as Tyler, since now without a master, he's even more out of control and sanity. It's been said before that Hydes can't live without a master.

https://preview.redd.it/e88ceikvi8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=45a245aae5d80b8b21a2f593717327900ac578d8

Then we have the scene of Tyler infiltrating the students on ""Outcast Day Of Remembrance,"" smiling when he finds Enid.

https://preview.redd.it/o282dcvnf8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=31c09a43e68538eecda59cc127413e76cdf4930f

Enid appears later, running from something, possibly Tyler already transformed into Hyde.

https://preview.redd.it/m7vso5dof8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=976d043c4825ad70271a370ff4dd3c6f0c3dc21d

And then he stands before Enid and her friends, indicating a possible ambush he's fallen into.

https://preview.redd.it/ms3nyzyof8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=b899e47448c83ea6250171cf019c9feb9aa0e080

And here we have the scene; Wednesday appears behind him with a syringe in her hand, about to inject him. Notice that her expression isn't one of hatred or tension to kill him, but rather clear determination. She's about to do something bold.

https://preview.redd.it/yh488phqf8jf1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6572aa0cadc71611dc73fde1868729ca36f5d853

We know that Hydes can be tamed through induction; whether chemical, traumatic, or hypnotic. In Season 1, Lauren was shown using emotional manipulation and chemical induction.

https://preview.redd.it/9504x05rf8jf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66ae8a5a2b98632e8a93c43ce3b813ff0b39d387

The syringe is extremely similar to the one Lauren held in the cave to tame Tyler the first time, so we can assume she'll do the same thing, but without the emotional manipulation, since it wasn't necessary when the two had a relationship in the previous season.

Wednesday may have difficulty taming him or may not be able to do it at the time, but it will eventually happen.

https://preview.redd.it/sh000iauf8jf1.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7ae533a2f141b7fed1fe3cecb3ec23decb1d919

And finally, we have an image leaked by a Netflix profile, where the caption plays with the term ""mascot."" They don't seem to be confronting each other, so...

  
You might ask, ""Why would she do that?"", and I answer: because he's not the main villain. He's an antagonist on a dark path who needs help, and it would also be killing two birds with one stone: Tyler's Hyde would no longer be the main threat and could be Wednesday's ally in facing the final villain.

1mr7b3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTechTakes/comments/1mr7b3q/explore_the_best_sticker_printer_phomemo_t02_and/,Explore the Best Sticker Printer Phomemo T02 and Is It Worth It,"Testing out the Phomemo T02 sticker printer has been an interesting experience for me, as someone who frequently relies on portable printers for daily tasks, office use, and personal creative projects. This little device is compact yet surprisingly versatile, claiming its spot as a must-have accessory for anyone looking to print on the go. While it offers a lot of appeal, there are also some quirks and limitations worth noting. Here's how it has held up in my everyday use.

**Design and Portability**  
The first thing I noticed about the Phomemo T02 is its size‚Äîit's incredibly compact and lightweight. Measuring just 4.53 x 3.46 x 3.27 inches and weighing a mere 12 ounces, this printer is easy to slip into a bag or even a larger jacket pocket. I‚Äôve carried it to coffee shops, workshops, and even my kid‚Äôs school events without feeling like I‚Äôm lugging around extra weight. Its pastel pink color is eye-catching, though I imagine some might prefer an option with a more neutral tone. The fact that it‚Äôs not larger than the palm of my hand makes it feel less like a ‚Äúdevice‚Äù and more like a handy gadget I can‚Äôt live without.

**Inkless Printing Technology**  
What sets the Phomemo T02 apart is its thermal printing technology. It prints without ink, which eliminates all the hassle of buying replacement cartridges. The device works seamlessly with thermal sticker paper and even colored or transparent papers, which adds so much flexibility. I‚Äôve used it to print stickers for craft projects, quick to-do lists, and even notes for my child who loves adding little designs to their school books. However, the thermal technology also means that print quality maxes out at 200-300 dpi‚Äînot exactly photo-quality, but fine for casual use.

[Ready to buy Phomemo T02? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://preciseshop.com/p/b0dk3644v1/)

**User Experience and App Integration**  
Connecting the printer to my phone was a breeze. It uses Bluetooth to pair with iOS and Android devices, and I was up and running in under five seconds. The dedicated Phomemo app is intuitive and offers a ton of customization options. From unique fonts to filter effects and themes, there are plenty of creative possibilities for someone like me who loves customizing their prints. That being said, some app features feel overly focused on aesthetics, which could be annoying if you‚Äôre seeking a straightforward function, like quick text printing.

**Upsides**  
- The printer‚Äôs portability and lightweight design make it perfect for on-the-go printing.  
- It supports a variety of papers, including transparent and colored ones, broadening its usability.  
- Inkless thermal printing eliminates the need for ink refills, saving money and reducing mess.  
- The Bluetooth pairing process is quick and effortless.  
- The Phomemo app adds extra creativity with fonts, effects, and themes.  

**Negatives**  
- The print resolution is limited to 200-300 dpi, which isn‚Äôt ideal for printing high-quality images.  
- The app options, while versatile, can overwhelm users who value simplicity over design gimmicks.  
- There is no duplex printing option, making it less efficient for double-sided tasks.  

**Performance and Practicality**  
In actual day-to-day use, I primarily use this printer for my kids‚Äô school projects, quick memos, and even some basic work tasks. It shines best when used for lightweight jobs like making small stickers or study materials. Cutting the printouts with scissors is an extra step but not a dealbreaker, though pre-perforated rolls would‚Äôve been a nice addition. Its maximum input capacity of 20 sheets is reasonable for its size, but it's something to consider if you plan to print in bulk.

**Product Comparisons**  
Compared to other portable printers I‚Äôve tried, like the PeriPage and the PocketJet, the Phomemo T02 feels more targeted toward casual users and crafters. For instance, the PocketJet produces higher-resolution prints and works better for professional documents, but it‚Äôs bulkier and significantly more expensive. The PeriPage, while also compact and using thermal technology, doesn‚Äôt match the T02 in terms of customizability and paper compatibility. If you value portability and the ability to add creative flourishes to your projects, the Phomemo T02 has a clear edge.

**Value for Money**  
For a device this small and portable, the Phomemo T02 packs a commendable feature set. The cost is reasonable for what it offers, particularly considering the freedom from ink expenses. However, if your primary use revolves around high-resolution image printing or heavy office workloads, you might feel limited by its capabilities. It strikes a sweet spot between affordability and practicality, making it a great choice for students, crafters, and casual users alike.

It‚Äôs crazy how far I‚Äôve come with staying home with baby and such. My husband didn‚Äôt take his full baby leave (he only did a month) so he can spend the month of September with us. But he still gets off days so when I see him struggling with the baby I literally see myself and the struggles I went through over the course of these weeks and it makes me giggle. 
Baby is much more fussier, wants to be held/close all the time. And my husbands response is frustration and by no means am I laughing at his struggles but I definitely saw myself during his moments. I can see the relieve in him whenever I‚Äôm up and I takeover for him! I still struggle and all but we‚Äôve gotten this far, right? 
Not to mention how crazy I was when I thought I wasn‚Äôt feeding her enough when it came to breasfeeding. Those days I cried thinking that I was starving her & I couldn‚Äôt bond with her. I went from 2-2.5 oz of breastmilk to producing about 4oz now. It‚Äôs still not a lot but at least my supply is going up! My let down is a bit strong sometimes baby will unlatch or drink it down really fast. I don‚Äôt pump as much, mostly at night since she sleeps through the night. I leave a bottle for her in the morning and freeze the rest for those days I‚Äôll give her away to her grandparents. I continue to pray for strength, to keep going, and to continue being the best mama I can. 
I‚Äôm going through the fussy phase with my husband & right now I‚Äôm currently sitting on the couch with my baby glued to my hip, sleeping. While my husband is out and about on his off day (I like to give him breaks too because he works a lot at his job). I am soooo grateful to have such an amazing husband who lets me sleep in on his off days while he watches baby. Cleans the house when it starts looking rough. Encourages me about my breastmilk supply. Or make me meals to eat when I‚Äôm clearly just relying on snacks. He cleans my pumps so nicely and gives me and baby kisses on the head while we lie in bed. I truly do not deserve him! 
I try to get up in the morning on his work days to make him a coffee breakfast and lunch to take with him as baby sleeps in the room. It really feels like we‚Äôre a family haha. 
This still isn‚Äôt easy but we are getting through it the best we can. And I‚Äôm not gonna lie. I can‚Äôt wait until hubby is back home in September! Thanks for listening to my ramble ",2,1755285017.0,NewParents,1,1.0,False

**Beyond the Lines**

Quick note: Han Dong‚Äôs arc as Liu Buwang is very similar to his roles in ***The Blossoming Love*** and ***The Longest Promise*** where he never ends up with his one true love. Not entirely related to this section, but I just wanted to point out that Ji Chen‚Äôs character, Chai Anxi, meets the same fate here as in ***The Legend of Zhuohua*** and ***Back From the Brink***, playing yet again the fallen military man. The typecasting is strong with this one.

[Loneliness knows them by name.](https://preview.redd.it/4igsg4ghb8jf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4be5699927865ed24d67dae1334665f4c033be53)

Getting back on track‚Ä¶

The story of Princess Mengji and Liu Buwang serves as a cautionary tale. It demonstrates two different ways of dealing with fate and love: giving up when things get tough and missing your chances, versus actually fighting for what matters to you.

The main struggle in this side story is between fate and what people can actually control. The princess represents duty and royal obligations, and at first she tries to run away from her arranged marriage, but her life and love story end up being controlled by outside forces: bandits, Taoist Yunji keeping Liu Buwang prisoner, her own father's manipulation, and decades later, a coming war. Liu Buwang‚Äôs story backs this up since he becomes a victim of his master‚Äôs harsh control which stops him from going back to the love of his life. The sad part is that neither of them can overcome these barriers that other people put in their way.

The subplot explores love, sacrifice, and regret. Liu Buwang‚Äôs actions, saying he‚Äôll come back for her and then not showing up, look like abandonment to the princess. His secret love only comes out after he dies when she finds the bangles he said he wouldn‚Äôt buy. Learning about this so late paints just how tragic their romance really was where hidden feelings and not trusting each other led to over twenty years of heartbreak. His final sacrifice of dying to protect her proves his deep, though never spoken, love, symbolized by the bangles.

Their tragic romance is also about the corrosive power of memory and the passage of time. The over two decades that separated them are more than just a blank space; they are filled with the princess‚Äôs bitterness and Liu Buwang‚Äôs persistent hope. Their ‚Äúconversation‚Äù through the qin across a physical barrier is both a symbol of their distance and a representation of their memories and pain being played out for the present. Mu Hongjin is imprisoned by her memory of Liu Buwang‚Äôs supposed abandonment while he is haunted by the memory of their time together. The story argues that time doesn‚Äôt heal all wounds, and that memories, if left to fester, can be as powerful and destructive as any external force. Before Liu Buwang‚Äôs death, it‚Äôs revealed that his memory of Mu Hongjin was still that of their youth from over two decades ago.

Princess Mengji‚Äôs advice to He Yan to ‚Äúcherish who she loves‚Äù and ‚Äútrust him‚Äù comes from serious regret. She‚Äôs telling He Yan to avoid her mistake: not giving the person she loves a real chance which ended up meaning she didn‚Äôt give herself a chance at happiness either.

It was also mentioned that Liu Buwang shows up in Jiyang City annually during the Water God Festival. He‚Äôs returning every year like a ghost of missed opportunities, driving home the fact that he has continued to hope for love and also makes us wonder IF and how many times he has tried to see Mu Hongjin since she became a widow, with her turning him down each time.

Liu Buwang‚Äôs philosophy, given to He Yan, recontextualizes the tragedy. He lost his chance because he allowed external circumstances, and maybe his own passivity of will, to dictate his actions.

This side story is an example of what happens when love gets sacrificed for other duties and when people can‚Äôt communicate properly. The princess‚Äôs final words to He Yan sum up the whole message: love needs action, trust, and the guts to fight for your own happiness, or you‚Äôll end up living with the regret of losing love to fate.

Incorporating this arc hints that He Yan and Xiao Jue‚Äôs relationship will be tested by the same clash between responsibility and desire. It implies they may face the same conflict between duty and happiness, but unlike Princess Mengji and Master Yunlin, they now carry a lesson written in loss to guide their choices.",18,1755284985.0,CDrama,24,0.91,False

We had a great walking tour with Derick (see [here](https://www.guruwalk.com/walks/30560-dar-es-salaam-walk-the-city-and-soar-to-new-heights)) and enjoyed dinner at [305 Karafuu](https://305karafuu.co.tz/).

The next day, we headed out to Lushoto, which I think must be one of the most underrated areas in Tanzania - it's a picturesque region nestled in the Usambara Mountains, known for its lush, green landscapes, cool climate, and cultural. We stayed at the lovely [David Crater Homestay](https://share.google/yuYxuMFUpcsTCToDN), which offers very comfortable rooms and great meals. David organised a stunning hike for us, passing through farm fields, Kisasa water falls, and the Irente viewpoint. After Lushoto, we headed out to Arusha where we ventured on safari - that's a description for another time, but I'll say it should be on your bucketlist!

**Zanzibar: where to base yourself?**

From Arusha, we flew out to Zanzibar. Having visited several corners of the island before, I decided that we'd concentrate on the north-east and the southern parts, with about 4-5 nights at each. Previously, I spent time in the north, particularly around Nungwi, and found this to be very commercialised, over-hyped, and more expensive.

If you're after relaxed vibes with more peaceful time at the beach, then I'd recommend the stretch of coastline between Pwani Mchangani and Matemwe. For example, a spot [like this](https://www.booking.com/Share-H65zmHY) in Pwani Mchangani. This area has some of the more pristine beaches, calm and warm waters, and fewer so-called 'beach boys' than the north (Nungwi and Kendwa, for example). There are also fantastic restaurants, especially local ones, with some of the best seafood around.

In the south, Makunduchi and Kizimkazi are great options. They're both a little more off-the-beaten-path, so you definitely have a rural feel. The beaches are beautiful, though I'd stay Pwani and Matemwe is a bit better in terms of tides and for long walks.

**...but what if I want a more lively vibe?**

Then I'd suggest Jambiani or Paje. The former is probably the best balanced of the two - it offers plenty of activities and great restaurants, whilst remaining central and peaceful. Paje is a paradise for kitesurfers, but I find that it's becoming nearly as commercial as the north. 

**What about Stone Town?**

It's a great place with a fascinating history of Swahili, Omani, Portuguese, French, and British influence. If you have the luxury of time, spending a night or two here is great, but if pressed, I'd suggest just a day visit from wherever you are based on the island. Highly recommend joining one of the walking tours to get a good sense of the city and appreciate what it offers.

**Outstanding restaurants**

It's almost impossible to have a bad meal in Zanzibar! The fruit, veggies, and seafood are so fresh and widely available. A few of my favourite spots:

*Stone Town*

[Harbour Indian Kitchen](https://share.google/4s8mU33i7v0LpSDdH) offers some of the best vegerian dishes  
The rooftop at [Zanzibar Coffee House](https://www.utengule.com/zanzibar-coffee-house) (double check opening hours!)

*South (Kizimkazi)*

Arguably my favourite restaurant on the whole island: [Fahari Off The Grid](https://share.google/EdBDUPM3I2rSF0IY6). The owner, with a Jamaican background and extensive experience in Africa, has a gorgeous spot under Baobab trees, serving a beautiful fusion of Afro-Caribbean cuisine. 

*Pwani Mchangani area*

For some fantastic local seafood in a laidback setting, check out [Kilimanjaro Restaurant](https://share.google/Jc9oO28RDGucniMRw) and [Mzuri](https://share.google/pFOA1YVAfPbE9qjJD). Another option for great cocktails and food is [ZenZero](https://share.google/gvxrqvgvFyzwxW7fa) \- on the beachfront.

**Activities**

Besides all the beautiful beach time on the island, Zanzibar is a great place for snorkeling and diving. Different regions have their own providers, and usually your host accommodation would be able to offer tips. From experience, I can recommend [Captain Haji](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g616020-d27173888-Reviews-Zanzibar_local_boat_trips-Paje_Zanzibar_Island_Zanzibar_Archipelago.html) in the Paje / Jambiani area for boat trips. And for diving, [this is a great option](https://www.divecenterzanzibar.com/) in Jambiani.

I also enjoyed a tour at [Mwani](https://mwanizanzibar.com/), which sis a company that farms and processes seaweed, transforming it into skincare products. They employ local women, the ""Mwani Mamas,"" who cultivate the seaweed and participate in the production process, combining traditional knowledge with modern techniques.

Jozani forest is Zanzibar's only national park, home to the rare Red Colobus Monkey. It's well-worth [exploring options](https://jozaniforest.com/) that suit you to enjoy the forest!

**Some practical considerations**

üíµ Cash is preferred across the island - for restaurants, fuel, and often also for accommodation. Usually both USD and local Tanzanian Shillings are accepted. I found the ABSA ATMs to be the most reliable.

üöó I've always driven in Zanzibar. Whilst road conditions vary - from potholes galore to easily navigable dual carriageways - this is the reality of driving in a developing country. If you're not comfortable with that, look into taxi options or discuss with your accommodation. I recommend [Zancars](https://zancars.com/) for hiring your own vehicle. 

üì±It's worth getting a local sim card for your phone. I'd suggest going with Yas network for good coverage and reasonable prices. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Stay safe and comfortable by using an anti-mosquito spray. They're not very much trouble, but it's good to be careful. Most accommodation providers include a mosquito net around the beds.

**What to avoid...**

üö©Some will offer you boat trips to see the dolphins - if this is guaranteed, it's probably part of a group that takes part in unethical dolphin chasing. Unfortunately, a lot of the tours to Mnemba island are this way. 

üö©Swimming with turtles and similar activities should also be approached with caution. Check the provider and recent reviews to confirm how ethical this is.

üö©If you go for a blue safari, I'd suggest [the original](https://safariblue.net/) \- not the copycat options. 

üö©Personally, I find the spice farm tours a little inauthentic. Unguja - the main island of the Zanzibar archipelago - no longer has proper spice farms. The ones set up are for demo purposes; the real ones are on the Pemba island. It's also questionable whether the spices sold at the end of the tours are actually the real deal...or generic spices you'd find at your local supermarket.

## Key features Analysis

The best living room benches in 2025 offer a blend of aesthetic appeal, durability, and practicality. We'll look at some of the key features that distinguish top-tier models from the rest.

**Material Quality:** The material of a living room bench substantially impacts its longevity and appearance. Premium benches utilize high-quality woods like solid oak, walnut, or sustainably sourced hardwoods for the frame, ensuring structural integrity and resistance to wear and tear. Upholstery materials range from durable, stain-resistant fabrics to luxurious leather, each offering a unique texture and aesthetic.

The choice of materials also influences the overall feel of the bench. A solid wood bench provides a natural, rustic charm, while an upholstered bench offers added comfort and a touch of elegance. The quality of the stitching and finishing details are also crucial indicators of a well-made bench.**Design and Style:** Living room benches come in a variety of designs to suit different interior styles. Modern benches often feature clean lines, minimalist silhouettes, and neutral color palettes, while customary benches may incorporate ornate carvings, tufted upholstery, and rich, warm tones. The versatility of bench designs allows them to seamlessly integrate into various living room settings.

Consider the overall aesthetic of your living room when selecting a bench design. A bench with a low profile and simple shape can complement a contemporary space, while a bench with a higher backrest and detailed embellishments can enhance a classic or transitional decor. The key is to choose a design that harmonizes with your existing furniture and reflects your personal style.

**Size and Dimensions:** The size and dimensions of a living room bench are critical factors to consider, especially in relation to the available space. Benches should be proportionate to the surrounding furniture and not overwhelm the room. Measure your living room carefully and consider the placement of the bench before making a purchase.

A bench that is too large can make a room feel cramped, while a bench that is too small may appear insignificant. Consider the number of people you typically need to accommodate when choosing the size of the bench. A longer bench can serve as ample seating for multiple guests, while a smaller bench may be ideal for adding a touch of style to a smaller living room.

**Storage Capacity:** many modern living room benches incorporate built-in storage solutions,providing a practical way to declutter your living space. These benches may feature lift-up seats, drawers, or open shelving, offering ample space to store blankets, pillows, books, or other household items. Storage benches are an excellent choice for smaller living rooms where space is at a premium.

The storage capacity of a bench can significantly enhance its functionality. A bench with a lift-up seat allows for easy access to stored items, while a bench with drawers provides a more organized storage solution. Consider your storage needs when selecting a bench, and choose a model that offers the right balance of seating and storage space.

What‚Äôs up everyone -

Been dealing with some weird symptoms for years now and just don‚Äôt know how to pinpoint what‚Äôs going on. Been basically going in circles, researching each symptoms to try and connect the dots, but what I have going on is so odd I‚Äôm basically going in circles driving myself crazy. So I wanted to post in here to see if anyone can help pinpoint what I have going on and any recommendation/advice is greatly, greatly appreciated.

Now let me preface all of this by saying, this isn‚Äôt a simple solution - so if you‚Äôre just gonna respond by saying ‚Äúmaybe you need better sleep, better hydration, be more active, etc.‚Äù please just don‚Äôt. With all due respect, just trying to save both mine and your time. I‚Äôve been dealing with this for quite some time, trust me I‚Äôve tried all the ‚Äúsimple solutions‚Äù you can think of. I need some deeper thinking applied here. When i say this, please don‚Äôt hesitate to ask me questions, but don‚Äôt respond by saying ‚ÄúaRE yOu DrInKiNG eNoUGh WatER and ElectRoLytes‚Äù, not the post for that. 

So, let me start by saying, this is a cyclical thing (so weird). Starting every Thursday morning, i wake up and i feel absolutely terrible. I look at myself in the mirror and im not even seeing the same person, i have massive dark bags under my eyes, my face is pale and bloated - i feel and look terrible. My stomach is bloated, im around 15% bf with visible able so I can clearly see when I have a little pouch out of nowhere. I have awful brain fog, im so fatigued, almost dizzy in a way, I‚Äôm in a terrible mood, cant think and can barely focus on anything. Im super anxious (normally very calm with no anxiety), and overthink a ton - i literally feel like i wanna hide in a dark room for these 2 days. Also when Thursday starts the gut issues begin, nausea, indigestion, loose stools and a bit of acid reflux. Now remember, when I say I have all these symptoms, the days leading up to Thursday and Friday i feel great. I feel like myself, sharp, focused, energized, less anxiety/overthinking, mood is stable, gut feels good, i feel hydrated, i feel sexually healthy. Now let‚Äôs continue, on Thursday I feel incredibly dehydrated, my mouth is dry, my skin is dry, and I actually have a weird taste in my mouth (could be because it‚Äôs so dry?; not sure). No amount of water, salt, electrolytes help this. I also have ZERO libido, the desire/want to have sex is 0% (my total T ranges anywhere from 900-1000). My joints are sore, working out  on Thursday and Friday are brutal, my joints ache and I simply just don‚Äôt feel strong. I actually feel much weaker on those days. Last thing I noticed recently is my right lymph node under my jaw is swollen - my neck also feels swollen along with my face, no idea what this could mean; Infection? Virus? Not a clue. And guys let me just say again, there‚Äôs no amount of working out, sweating, sunlight, water, electrolytes, coffee, walking/ etc. that helps. There‚Äôs nothing I can do that even TOUCHES these symptoms or lessens them at all. And believe me, I‚Äôve tried all the simple stuff.

Ok so now here‚Äôs the kicker, Saturday mid morning rolls around ‚Ä¶ poof symptoms are gone. Quality of sleep was great, face and stomach de bloat, eye bags/circles are gone, the color of my skin comes back to normal , much less anxiety, mood is stable gut issues stabilize, i feel hydrated and happy and my libido spikes back.. i feel like me again. This has literally happened cycle after cycle for months and months and months. I know it sounds crazy but is happened to me every week for years now. 

It‚Äôs hard to even go to a doctor and explain this because, where would we even start? 

In terms of my diet, it‚Äôs Whole Foods and that‚Äôs it. Zero sugar. I‚Äôve been eating just Whole Foods for a long time  ow and i honestly feel incredible on this diet, my body composition is awesome and I feel really good mentally, just outside of Thursday and Friday. So weird, i know lol.

(Relationship?),"I think many of you have already seen the trailer, and I believe you've seen the theory about Wednesday becoming Tyler's master, but I haven't seen a full post about it yet. So I decided to make one!

https://preview.redd.it/28l1bkfbc8jf1.png?width=545&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf484be44b8d76568a9878d273c558ed37bb1f8a

Let's start with the fact that the idea has already been presented behind the scenes by Jenna and Tyler themselves. In an interview, Jenna says that ""it would be really, REALLY interesting if Wednesday had a monster as a pet,"" and Tyler says he ""would do that for Jenna."" The two have shown agreement on this relationship between their characters, which is new considering Jenna's previous positions.

https://preview.redd.it/hkqrmm7dc8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e88e0b3f9084767c1f3558fa82fca6eca4cc9950

In the second episode of season 2, where Tyler and Wednesday reunite after the events of season 1, Tyler finds himself handcuffed with a shock collar around his neck. He pulls on the handcuffs to approach the bars and talk to Wednesday.

https://preview.redd.it/2koqvp5ec8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a5a8368881d878d927c92c98805c41b38ccb15a

The scene cuts to Wednesday showing a slight smile; Perhaps pleased to see him locked up after everything he's done, but also out of personal preference...?

https://preview.redd.it/hvc4bg6fc8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7aa34f135d8b217bc9d11c4f8f2c051bb21503fd

Then we have the dialogue ""You sensed the monster in me, and you fell in love with it,"" a statement made by Tyler that Wednesday doesn't deny. Here we see that she's not attracted to, much less likes, the criminal acts Hyde committed, but rather his dangerous existence itself. That's what attracted Wednesday, even if unconsciously.

We even get this confirmation in Episode 7 of Season 1, when Wednesday discovers that Tyler is Hyde after kissing him in the coffee shop, running away while saying, ""Of course my first kiss would be with a psychopathic serial killer monster. I think it's my type.""

https://preview.redd.it/i25tstdhc8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=898fffb12d52eb072219301c74fc2dcb335e80c6

Back in Season 2, we have Episode 4, when Wednesday rescues Fester from the asylum and ends up releasing all the patients as a result, including Tyler. In the final scene, he appears transformed, running down the hallway toward her. She tells the woman she rescued to run ahead of her, staying behind as she watches him approach.

Here we see a look of fear, anxiety, curiosity...? We don't know exactly. But she stands there until he stops in front of her.

https://preview.redd.it/h11z7rkic8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c3d8815c2849a918bec2131f99483e7d94868bd

This is where it gets really strange, because they stare at each other for several long seconds, and then the scene cuts to outside. The question here isn't whether he threw her out the window or not; Why did she stand still if she knew she was in danger?

I believe that for a moment, she believed he wouldn't hurt her, and he also hesitated for a moment when he saw her. The exchange of glances, as if they were both waiting for something, is quite strange.

Maybe this is where Wednesday saw something about Tyler, even though he was transformed into a monster. Which leads to her wanting to save him in Part 2.

https://preview.redd.it/zm1bdw5nc8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=127b8459faa0703f0e8c6ae2d5637b64a70b6124

From here on, we have information from the trailer.

We have a conversation between Wednesday and Enid, where Wednesday talks about Tyler being on the loose and wanting to kill them both. That she could fix it.

Later, we have the phrase ""a life hangs in the balance,"" which is contradictory, since they would both be at risk... unless they aren't as much as Tyler, since now without a master, he's even more out of control and sanity. It's been said before that Hydes can't live without a master.

https://preview.redd.it/cis2hpfoc8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec6dba35397ebbf224acbd2f3c13844b67ca8c48

Then we have the scene of Tyler infiltrating the students on ""Outcast Day Of Remembrance,"" smiling when he finds Enid.

https://preview.redd.it/vdm0xdgrc8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cca340e259f0a640dde59e1b94b46a7021684b3

Enid appears later, running from something, possibly Tyler already transformed into Hyde.

https://preview.redd.it/o4dor42vc8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4c8315080e2ec377843f336dc7677d3a701ca09

And then he stands before Enid and her friends, indicating a possible ambush he's fallen into.

https://preview.redd.it/8jxkvnyvc8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=67878afb5c960ad3d87cc087f3c134c5c2f40113

https://preview.redd.it/srbv3towc8jf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7fc238761d530720a34cf1ff439ef220d2bb85f

And here we have the scene; Wednesday appears behind him with a syringe in her hand, about to inject him. Notice that her expression isn't one of hatred or tension to kill him, but rather clear determination. She's about to do something bold.

https://preview.redd.it/a1wpi38xc8jf1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58d1158f7225f3de80b9fa4bf2954a5e6bdf886e

We know that Hydes can be tamed through induction; whether chemical, traumatic, or hypnotic. In Season 1, Lauren was shown using emotional manipulation and chemical induction.

https://preview.redd.it/t8mue6fyc8jf1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d15ee50f0e6c6143e9d007fcf454eaf3d6189b3d

The syringe is extremely similar to the one Lauren held in the cave to tame Tyler the first time, so we can assume she'll do the same thing, but without the emotional manipulation, since it wasn't necessary when the two had a relationship in the previous season.

Wednesday may have difficulty taming him or may not be able to do it at the time, but it will eventually happen.

https://preview.redd.it/07fabhy0d8jf1.png?width=590&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7c3ca6514e52723221fa5fb323868a66df4d0ed

And finally, we have an image leaked by a Netflix profile, where the caption plays with the term ""mascot."", it doesn't look like they're confronting each other, so...

1mr6wsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechInUse/comments/1mr6wsr/why_are_jvc_compact_the_best_wireless_headphones/,Why Are JVC Compact the Best Wireless Headphones for Travel Use,"The JVC HAA30TB truly wireless headphones have been a delightful addition to my audio gear collection. Testing them daily in various scenarios, from work calls to binge-watching my favorite shows, gives me a good sense of their strengths and limitations. With compact active noise-canceling (ANC) capabilities and Bluetooth 5.2 technology, these earbuds manage to pack a punch in both convenience and performance. The sleek black design fits snugly without compromising comfort, even after hours of continuous use.

**Design and Build Quality**

The earbuds are small, lightweight, and comfortable. Weighing just 3.21 ounces, they‚Äôre easy to carry‚Äîeven with the charging case in tow. The plastic material might not scream ‚Äúpremium,‚Äù but it does feel sturdy enough for daily use without the constant worry of dropping them. IPX4 water resistance also came in handy when I got caught in light rain during a short walk. 

These have a modern aesthetic with a minimalistic build. The touch controls on each bud are easy to use, responding quickly when skipping tracks or adjusting the volume during a workout. I can confidently say the design caters to daily and travel-friendly use.

**Performance for Everyday Use**

The sound quality was a pleasant surprise. Featuring active noise cancellation, the earbuds drown out unwanted sounds effectively‚Äîbe it the hum of a fan or background chatter at a coffee shop. Listening to music felt immersive. The bass could‚Äôve been deeper, sure, but for a device this compact at this price point, the experience was solid. Low-latency mode is a standout feature I didn‚Äôt realize I needed until I tried it. Watching Netflix without the audio falling behind the visuals? Chef‚Äôs kiss.

The active noise cancellation is reasonably effective but not groundbreaking. It works great for commutes or quieter spaces but struggles slightly with louder environments. Most in this category face the same hurdle, so no real complaints here.

**Ease of Use for Various Scenarios**

The JVC wireless headphones are simple to pair, thanks to Bluetooth 5.2. The connection remained rock-solid for over 20 feet, even with walls obstructing the path, which impressed me. My wife frequently borrows them for hands-free calls, and the touch sensor works smoothly for muting the mic with one tap. Independent use of each earbud is also great for multitasking. For example, I often pop one in while keeping the other ear free to hear the kids.

The 10-minute quick charge feature saved me in countless moments of unpreparedness. Heading out the door for a long walk and realizing the earbuds needed juice? After just 10 minutes, I had enough playback time to cover a couple of episodes of my favorite podcast.

**Positives**

- Active noise cancellation adds an immersive sound experience.
- Quick charge allows 75 minutes of playback after only 10 minutes plugged in.
- The low-latency mode is ideal for games and video streaming.
- Lightweight and designed with comfort in mind, even for extended use.
- Flexibility to use each earbud independently.

**Negatives**

- Plastic build doesn't feel premium.
- Bass levels could be better for audiophiles.
- Active noise cancellation is less ideal in extremely noisy environments.
- No app support for customizable sound profiles.

**Product Comparisons**

Comparing the JVC HAA30TB to other popular active noise-canceling buds, such as Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 or Sony WF-C500, was eye-opening. The Anker model, while similar in price, boasts an app for sound customization, which JVC lacks. However, the quick charge and low-latency gaming made the JVC headphones more versatile for my varied lifestyle. The Sony WF-C500, on the other hand, excels in pure sound quality but couldn‚Äôt beat the JVC model's 21-hour total battery life.

The absence of certain premium features like wireless charging support puts the JVC headphones at a slight disadvantage compared to competitors in the higher price bracket, but for regular users who value battery life and convenience, these earbuds hold their ground.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

For anyone wondering whether they‚Äôre worth the investment‚Äîit depends on what you need. These earbuds strike a balance between affordability and innovation. They‚Äôre not the absolute best in active noise cancellation or bass depth, but the long battery life, quick charge, and low-latency mode make them a practical choice for the average user looking for solid performance without overspending.

¬† THE BASEMENT HALLWAYS IN King‚Äôs College of Medical Research were dark, even in the daytime.  
  
¬† At night they were like a grave.  
  
¬† Rats crawled through corridors that dripped with cold perspiration. The chill in the sunken rooms kept the specimens from rotting and numbed my own flesh, too, through the worn layers of my dress. When I cleaned those rooms, late at night after the medical students had gone home to their warm beds, the sound of my hard-bristle brush echoed in the operating theater, down the twisting halls, into the storage spaces where they kept the things of nightmares. Other people‚Äôs nightmares, that is. Dead flesh and sharpened scalpels didn‚Äôt bother me. I was my father‚Äôs daughter, after all. My nightmares were made of darker things.  
  
¬† My brush paused against the mortar, frozen by a familiar sound from down the hall: the unwelcome tap-tap-tap of footsteps that meant Dr. Hastings had stayed late. I scrubbed harder, furiously, but blood had a way of seeping into the tiles so not even hours of work could get them clean.  
  
¬† The footsteps came closer until they stopped right behind me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it coming, then, Juliet?‚Äù His warm breath brushed the back of my neck.  
  
¬† Keep your eyes down, I told myself, scouring the bloodstained squares of mortar so hard that my own knuckles bled.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, Doctor. ‚Äù I kept it short, hoping he would leave, but he didn‚Äôt.  
  
¬† Overhead the electric bulbs snapped and clicked. I glanced at the silver tips of his shoes, so brightly polished that I could see the reflection of his balding scalp and milky eyes watching me. He wasn‚Äôt the only professor who worked late, or the only one whose gaze lingered too long on my bent-over backside. But the smell of lye and chemicals on my clothes deterred the others. Dr. Hastings seemed to relish it.  
  
¬† He slipped his pale fingers around my wrist. I dropped the brush. ‚ÄúYour knuckles are bleeding,‚Äù he said, pulling me to my feet.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the cold. It chaps my skin. ‚Äù I tried to tug my hand back, but he held it firm. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing. ‚Äù  
  
¬† His eyes followed the sleeve of my muslin dress to the stained apron and frayed hem, a dress that not even my father‚Äôs poorest servants would have worn. But that was many years ago, when we lived in the big house on Belgrave Square, where my closet burst with furs and silks and soft lacy things I‚Äôd worn only once or twice, since Mother threw out the previous year‚Äôs fashions like bathwater.  
  
¬† That was before the scandal.  
  
¬† Now, men seldom looked at my clothes for long. When a girl fell from privilege, men were less interested in her ratty skirts than in what lay underneath, and Dr. Hastings was no different. His eyes settled on my face. My friend Lucy told me I looked like the lead actress at the Brixton, a Frenchwoman with high cheekbones and skin pale as bone, even paler against the dark, straight hair she wore swept up in a Swiss-style chignon. I kept my hair in a simple braid, though a few strands always managed to slip out. Dr. Hastings reached up to tuck them behind my ear, his fingers rough as parchment against my temple. I cringed inside but fought to keep my face blank. Better to give no reaction so he wouldn‚Äôt be encouraged. But my shaking hands betrayed me.  
  
¬† Dr. Hastings smiled thinly. The tip of his tongue snaked out from between his lips.  
  
¬† Suddenly the sound of groaning hinges made him startle. My heart pounded wildly at this chance to slip away. Mrs. Bell, the lead maid, stuck her gray head through the cracked door. Her mouth curved in its perpetual frown as her beady eyes darted between the professor and me. I‚Äôd never been so glad to see her wrinkled face.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJuliet, out with you,‚Äù she barked. ‚ÄúMary‚Äôs gone and broken a lamp, and we need another set of hands. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I stepped away from Dr. Hastings, relief rolling off me like a cold sweat. My eyes met Mrs. Bell‚Äôs briefly as I slipped into the hall. I knew that look. She couldn‚Äôt watch out for me all the time.  
  
¬† One day, she might not be there to intercede.  
  
¬† THE MOMENT I WAS free of those dark hallways, I dashed into the street toward Covent Garden as the moon hovered low over London‚Äôs skyline. The harsh wind bit at my calves through worn wool stockings as I waited for a carriage to pass. Across the street a figure stood in the lee of the big wooden bandstand‚Äôs staircase.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou awful creature,‚Äù Lucy said, slipping out of the shadows. She hugged the collar of her fur coat around her long neck. Her cheeks and nose were red beneath a light sheen of French powder. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting an hour. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. ‚Äù I leaned in and pressed my cheek to hers. Her parents would be horrified to know she had snuck out to meet me. They had encouraged our friendship when Father was London‚Äôs most famous surgeon, but were quick to forbid her to see me after his banishment.  
  
¬† Luckily for me, Lucy loved to disobey.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve had me working late all week opening up some old rooms,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be cleaning cobwebs out of my hair for days. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She pretended to pluck something distasteful from my hair and grimaced. We both laughed. ‚ÄúHonestly, I don‚Äôt know how you can stand that work, with the rats and beetles and, my God, whatever else lurks down there. ‚Äù Her blue eyes gleamed mischievously. ‚ÄúAnyway, come on. The boys are waiting. ‚Äù She snatched my hand and we hurried across the courtyeard to a red-brick building with a stone staircase. Lucy banged the horse-head knocker twice.  
  
¬† The door swung open, and a young man with thick chestnut hair and a fine suit appeared. He had Lucy‚Äôs same fair skin and wide-set eyes, so this must have been the cousin she‚Äôd told me about. I timidly evaluated his tall forehead, the helix of his ears that projected only a hair too far from the skull. Good-looking, I concluded. He studied me wordlessly in return, in my third-hand coat, with worn elbows and frayed satin trim, that must have looked so out of place next to Lucy‚Äôs finely tailored one. But to his credit, his grin didn‚Äôt falter for a moment. She must have warned him she was bringing a street urchin and not to say anything rude.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet us in, Adam,‚Äù Lucy said, pushing past him. ‚ÄúMy toes are freezing to the street. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I slipped in behind her. Shrugging off her coat, she said, ‚ÄúAdam, this is the friend I‚Äôve told you about. Not a penny to her name, can‚Äôt cook, but God, just look at her. ‚Äù  
  
¬† My face went red, and I shot Lucy a withering look, but Adam only smiled. ‚ÄúLucy‚Äôs nothing if not blunt,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm used to it. I‚Äôve heard far worse come out of her mouth. And she‚Äôs right, at least about the last part. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I jerked my head toward him, expecting a leer. But he was being sincere, which only left me feeling more at a loss for words.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere are they?‚Äù Lucy asked, ignoring us. A bawdy roar spilled from a back room, and Lucy grinned and headed toward the sound. I expected Adam to follow her. But his gaze found me instead. He smiled again.  
  
¬† Startled, I paused a second too long. This was new. No vulgar winks, no glances at my chest. I was supposed to say something pleasant. But instead I drew a breath in, like a secret I had to keep close. I knew how to handle cruelty, not kindness.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMay I take your coat?‚Äù he asked. I realized I had my arms wrapped tightly around my chest, though it was pleasantly warm inside the house.  
  
¬† I forced my arms apart and slid the coat off. ‚ÄúThank you. ‚Äù My voice was barely audible.  
  
¬† We followed Lucy down the hall to a sitting room where a group of lanky medical students languished on leather sofas, sipping glasses of honey-colored liquid. Winter examinations had just ended and they were clearly deep into their celebration. This was the kind of thing Lucy adored‚Äîbreaking up a boys‚Äô club, drinking gin and playing cards and reveling in their shocked faces. She got away with it under the pretense of visiting her c  
ousin, though this was a far step from the elderly aunt‚Äôs parlor where Lucy was supposed to be meeting him.  
  
¬† Adam stepped forward to join the crowd, laughing at something someone said. I tried to feel at ease in the unfamiliar crowd, too aware of my shabby dress and chapped hands. Smile, Mother would have whispered. You belonged among these people, once. But first I needed to gauge how drunk they were, the lay of the room, who was most likely not to laugh at my poor clothes. Analyzing, always analyzing‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt feel safe until I knew every aspect of what I was facing.  
  
¬† Mother had been so confident around other people, always able to talk about the church sermon that morning, about the rising price of coffee. But I‚Äôd taken after my father when it came to social situations. Awkward. Shy. More apt to study the crowd like some social experiment than to join in.  
  
¬† Lucy had tucked herself on the sofa between a blond-haired boy and one with a face as red as an apple. A half-empty rum bottle dangled from her graceful fingers. When she saw me hanging back in the doorway, she stood and sauntered over.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe sooner you find a husband,‚Äù she growled playfully, ‚Äúthe sooner you can stop scrubbing floors. So pick one of them and say something charming. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I swallowed. My eyes drifted to Adam. ‚ÄúLucy, men like this don‚Äôt marry girls like me. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt the faintest idea what men want. They don‚Äôt want some snobbish porridge-faced brat plucking at needlepoint all day. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, but I‚Äôm a maid. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA temporary situation. ‚Äù She waved it away, as if my last few years of backbreaking work were nothing more than a lark. She jabbed me in the side. ‚ÄúYou come from money. From class. So show a little. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She held the bottle out to me. I wanted to tell her that sipping rum straight from a bottle wasn‚Äôt exactly showing class, but I‚Äôd only earn myself another jab.  
  
¬† I glanced at Adam. I‚Äôd never been good at guessing people‚Äôs feelings. I had to study their reactions instead. And in this situation, it didn‚Äôt take much to conclude I wasn‚Äôt what these men wanted, despite Lucy‚Äôs insistence.  
  
¬† But maybe I could pretend to be. Hesitantly, I took a sip.  
  
¬† The blond boy tugged Lucy to the sofa next to him. ‚ÄúYou must help us end a debate, Miss Radcliffe. Cecil says the human body contains two hundred ten bones, and I say two hundred eleven. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Lucy batted her pretty lashes. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt know. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I sighed and leaned into the doorframe.  
  
¬† The boy took her chin in his hand. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôll be so good as to hold still, I‚Äôll count, and we can find our answer. ‚Äù He touched a finger to her forehead. ‚ÄúOne. ‚Äù I rolled my eyes as the boy dropped his finger lower, to her shoulders. ‚ÄúTwo. And three. ‚Äù His finger ran slowly, seductively, along her collarbone. ‚ÄúFour. ‚Äù Then his finger traced even lower, to the thin skin covering her breastbone. ‚ÄúFive,‚Äù he said, so drawn out that I could smell the rum on his breath.  
  
¬† I cleared my throat. The other boys watched, riveted, as the boy‚Äôs finger drifted lower and lower over Lucy‚Äôs neckline. Why not just skip the pretense and grab her breast? Lucy was no better, giggling like she was enjoying it. Exasperated, I slapped his pasty hand off her chest.  
  
¬† The whole room went still.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWait your turn, darling,‚Äù the boy said, and they all laughed. He turned back to Lucy, holding up that ridiculous finger.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTwo hundred six,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† This got their attention. Lucy fell back against the leather sofa with an exasperated sigh.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI beg your pardon?‚Äù the boy said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTwo hundred six,‚Äù I repeated, feeling my cheeks warm. ‚ÄúThere are two hundred six bones in the body. I would think, as a medical student, you would know that. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Lucy‚Äôs head shook at my hopelessness, but her lips cracked in a smile regardless. The blond boy‚Äôs mouth went slack.  
  
¬† I answered before he could think. ‚ÄúIf you doubt me, tell me how many bones are in the human hand. ‚Äù The boys took no offense at my remark. On the contrary, they seemed all the more drawn to me for it. Maybe I was the kind of girl they wanted, after all.  
  
¬† Lucy‚Äôs only acknowledgment was an approving tip of the rum bottle in my direction.

I‚Äôll take that wager,‚Äù Adam interrupted, leveling his handsome green eyes at me.  
  
¬† Lucy jumped up and wrapped her arm around my shoulders. ‚ÄúOh, good! And what‚Äôs the wager, then? I‚Äôll not have Juliet risk her reputation for less than a kiss. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I immediately turned red, but Adam only grinned. ‚ÄúMy prize, if I am right, shall be a kiss. And if I am wrong‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf you are wrong‚Äù‚ÄîI interjected, feeling reckless; I grabbed the rum from Lucy and tipped the bottle back, letting the liquid warmth chase away my insecurity‚Äî‚Äúyou must call on me wearing a lady‚Äôs bonnet. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He walked around the sofa and took the bottle. The confidence in his step told me he didn‚Äôt intend to lose. He set the bottle on the side table and skimmed his forefinger tantalizingly along the delicate bones in the back of my hand. I parted my lips, curling my toes to keep from jerking my hand away. This wasn‚Äôt Dr. Hastings, I told myself. Adam was hardly shoving his hand down my neckline. It was just an innocent touch.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTwenty-four,‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† I felt a triumphant swell. ‚ÄúWrong. Twenty-seven. ‚Äù Lucy gave my leg a pinch and I remembered to smile. This was supposed to be flirtatious. Fun.  
  
¬† Adam‚Äôs eyes danced devilishly. ‚ÄúAnd how would a girl know such things?‚Äù  
  
¬† I straightened. ‚ÄúWhether I‚Äôm right or wrong has nothing to do with gender. ‚Äù I paused. ‚ÄúAlso, I‚Äôm right. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Adam smirked. ‚ÄúGirls don‚Äôt study science. ‚Äù  
  
¬† My confidence faltered. I knew how many bones there were in the human hand because I was my father‚Äôs daughter. When I was a child, Father would give physiology lessons to our servant boy, Montgomery, to spite those who claimed the lower classes were incapable of learning. He considered women naturally deficient, however, so I would hide in the laboratory closet during lessons, and Montgomery would slip me books to study. But I could hardly tell these young men that. Every medical student knew the name Moreau. They would remember the scandal.  
  
¬† Lucy jumped to my defense. ‚ÄúJuliet knows more than the lot of you. She works in the medical building. She‚Äôs probably spent more time around cadavers than you lily spirits. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I gritted my teeth, wishing she hadn‚Äôt told them. It was one thing to be a maid. Another to clean the laboratory after their botched surgeries. But Adam arched an eyebrow, interested.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs that so? Well then, I have a different wager for you, miss. ‚Äù His eyes danced with something more dangerous than a kiss. ‚ÄúI have a key to the college, and you must know your way around. Let‚Äôs find one of your skeletons and count for ourselves. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Glances darted among the other boys like sparks in a fire. They prodded one another, riling themselves up with the idea of a clandestine trip into the bowels of the medical building.  
  
¬† Lucy gave me an impish shrug. ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù  
  
¬† I hesitated. I‚Äôd spent enough time in those dank halls. There was a darkness there that had worked its way into the hollow spaces between my bones. A darkness that clung to the hallways like my father‚Äôs shadow, smelling of formaldehyde and his favorite apricot preserves. Tonight was supposed to be about escaping the darkness‚Äîif not in the arms of a future husband, at least in a few lighthearted moments.  
  
¬† I shook my head.  
  
¬† But the boys had made up their minds, and there was no convincing them otherwise. ‚ÄúAre you trying to get out of a kiss?‚Äù Adam teased.  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt respond. My desire for flirtation had evaporated at the mention of the university basements. But if Lucy didn‚Äôt balk at the idea of seeing a skeleton, surely I shouldn‚Äôt. I cleaned the cobwebs from their creaky bones every night. So what was holding me back?  
  
¬† Lucy leaned in and whispered in my ear. ‚ÄúAdam wants to impress you with how brave he is, you idiot. Swoon when you see the skeleton and fall into his arms. Men love that sort of thing. ‚Äù  
  
¬† My stomach tightened. God, was this what normal girls did? Feign weakness? I could never imagine Mother, with all her strict morals, doing something so scandalous as slipping into forbidden hallways on a dare. But Father‚Äîhe wouldn‚Äôt have hesitated. He would have been the one egging them on.  
  
¬† Dash it. I snatched the rum and poured the last few swallows down my throat. The boys cheered. I ignored the queasy feeling in my stomach‚Äînot from the rum, but from the thought of those dark hallways we were soon to enter.  
  
¬† Two  
  
¬† WE BUNDLED INTO OUR coats and slipped into the cold night, crossing the Strand toward the university‚Äôs brick archway. This late only a few lanterns shone in the upper windows. The boys passed a bottle around with hushed laughter at being on school grounds after hours. I wrapped my arm around Lucy‚Äôs and tried to join the mirth, but the warmth didn‚Äôt spread below my smile. For the boys, this taste of mild scandal was titillating. They‚Äôd never known real scandal or how it could tear a person apart.  
  
¬† Adam led us to the side of the building, through a row of hedges to a small black door I‚Äôd only used once or twice. He unlocked it and held it open. Hesitation rooted my feet to the ground, but a gentle tug from Lucy led me inside. The door closed, plunging us into darkness broken only by the light from one high window.  
  
¬† The hallway filled with the eerie silence of unused rooms. My hands itched for a rag and brush as a legitimate reason to be here. Coming on a lark to settle a silly wager, risking my job‚Äîit didn‚Äôt feel right.  
  
¬† Lucy squinted into the darkness, but I kept my eyes on the tile floor. I already knew what lay at the end of the hall.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell?‚Äù Adam asked. ‚ÄúWhich way to the skeletons, Mademoiselle Guillotine?‚Äù  
  
¬† I started to head for the small door to the storage chambers, but a light at the opposite end of the corridor caught my eye. The operating theater. Odd; no one should have been there this late. Something about that light chilled my blood‚Äîit could only mean trouble.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not alone,‚Äù I said, nodding toward the door. They boys followed my gaze and grew quiet. Lucy slid off her glove and found my hand in the dark.  
  
¬† Adam started toward the operating theater, but I grabbed the fabric of his cuff to hold him back. The hallways were filled with the normal smells‚Äîchemicals and rotten things. Usually it didn‚Äôt bother me, but tonight it felt so overpowering that my head started to spin. A wave of weakness hit me and I grabbed his wrist harder.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAre you all right?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† I waited a few seconds for the spell to pass. These spells were not uncommon, coming upon me suddenly, usually in the late evening, though I wasn‚Äôt about to explain their source to him. ‚ÄúThe skeletons are the other way,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs in the theater after hours. Whatever they‚Äôre doing, it has to be good. ‚Äù His voice was charged. This was a game to them, I realized. If they got caught, the dean might give them a stern talking-to. I would lose my livelihood.  
  
¬† He cocked his head. ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt scared, are you?‚Äù  
  
¬† I scowled and let go of his cuff. Of course I wasn‚Äôt scared. We made our way silently down the hall. As we approached the closed door, a sound began to gnaw at my ears. It took me back to my childhood, when I would hide outside the door to Father‚Äôs laboratory, listening, trying to imagine what was happening within before the servants chased me off.  
  
¬† The sound grew louder, a scrape-tap, scrape-tap. Unaccustomed to being in a laboratory, Lucy threw me a puzzled look. But I knew that sound. The scrape of scalpel on stone. A gesture surgeons made to clean the flesh from the blade between cuts.  
  
¬† Adam threw open the door. A half dozen students huddled around a table in the center of the room, over which a single lamp formed an island of light. They looked up when we entered, and then after a few seconds their faces relaxed with recognition.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAdam, you cad, get in and close the door,‚Äù said one of the students. He threw Lucy and me an annoyed look. ‚ÄúWhat are they doing here?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be no trouble. Right, ladies?‚Äù Adam raised his eyebrow, but I didn‚Äôt answer. A good part of me contemplated  
bolting out the door and leaving them to their sick lark. Yet I didn‚Äôt. As we drifted closer with hesitant steps, I could feel the stiffness in my bones easing, as though releasing some pent-up, slippery curiosity from between my joints.  
  
¬† Why were they in the operating theater after dark?  
  
¬† Adam peered over the surgeon‚Äôs shoulder. Their bodies blocked the table, but the metallic smell of fresh blood reached me, making my head spin. Lucy pressed a handkerchief to her mouth. Memories of my father flooded me. As a surgeon, blood had been his medium like ink to a writer. Our fortune had been built on blood, the acrid odor infused into the very bricks of our house, the clothes that we wore.  
  
¬† To me, blood smelled like home.  
  
¬† I shook away the feeling. Father had left us, I reminded myself. Betrayed us. But I still couldn‚Äôt help missing him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey shouldn‚Äôt be here,‚Äù I murmured. ‚ÄúThis building‚Äôs closed to students at night. ‚Äù  
  
¬† But before Lucy could answer, the scrape of the scalpel sounded again, drawing my gaze irresistibly to the table. We stepped forward. The boys paid us little attention, except Adam, who moved aside to make room. My breath caught. On the table lay a dead rabbit, its fur white as snow and spotted with blood. Its belly had been sliced open, and several organs lay on the table. Lucy gasped and covered her eyes.  
  
¬† My eyes were wide. I felt vaguely sorry for the dead rabbit, but it was a far-off sort of thought, something Mother might have felt. I wasn‚Äôt naive. Dissection was a necessary part of science. It was how doctors were able to develop medicine and how surgeons saved lives. I‚Äôd only ever glimpsed dissections a handful of times‚Äîpeeking through the keyhole of Father‚Äôs laboratory or cleaning up after medical students. After work, in my small room at the lodging house, I‚Äôd studied the diagrams in my father‚Äôs old copy of Longman‚Äôs Anatomical Reference, but black-and-white illustrations were a poor substitute for the real thing.  
  
¬† Now my eyes devoured the rabbit‚Äôs body, trying to match the fleshy bits of organ and bone to the ink diagrams I knew by heart. An urge raced through my veins to touch the striated muscle of the heart, feel the smooth length of intestine.  
  
¬† Lucy clutched her stomach, looking pale. I watched her curiously. I didn‚Äôt feel the need to turn away like normal ladies should. Mother had drilled into me the standards of proper young ladies, but my impulses didn‚Äôt always obey. So I had learned to hide them instead.  
  
¬† I looked back at the rabbit. Creeping vines of worry wound around my ankles and up my legs.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong. ‚Äù  
  
¬† The student performing the surgery glanced up, irritated, before selecting another scalpel and returning to work.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSh,‚Äù Adam breathed in my ear. My chest tightened as my eyes darted over the rabbit. There. The rabbit‚Äôs rear foot jerked. And there. Its chest rose and fell in a quick breath. I clasped Lucy‚Äôs hand, feeling the blood rushing to the base of my skull.  
  
¬† My brain processed the movements disjointedly, with an odd feeling like d√©j√† vu, and I gasped. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alive. ‚Äù  
  
¬† The rabbit‚Äôs glassy eye blinked. My heart faltered. I turned to Adam, bewildered, and then back to the table, where the boys continued to operate. They ignored me, as they ignored the rabbit‚Äôs movements. Something white and hot filled my head and I gripped the edge of the table, jolting it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not dead!‚Äù  
  
¬† The surgeon turned to Adam in annoyance. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better keep them quiet. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt supposed to be alive,‚Äù Lucy stammered, her face pale. The handkerchief slipped from her hand, falling to the floor slowly, dreamlike. ‚ÄúWhy is it alive?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúVivisection. ‚Äù The word came out of me like a vile thing trying to escape. ‚ÄúDissection of living creatures. ‚Äù I took a step back, wanting nothing to do with it. Dissection was one thing. What they were doing on that table was only cruel.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a rabbit,‚Äù Adam hissed. Lucy began to sway. I couldn‚Äôt tear my eyes off the operation. Had they even bothered to anesthetize it?

It‚Äôs against the law,‚Äù I muttered. My pulse matched the thumps of the frightened rabbit‚Äôs still-beating heart. I looked at the placement of the organs on the table. At the equipment carefully laid out. It was all familiar to me.  
  
¬† Too familiar.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúVivisection is prohibited by the university,‚Äù I said, louder.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo is having women in the operating theater,‚Äù the surgeon said, meeting my eyes. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre here, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBunch of Judys,‚Äù a dark-haired boy said with a sneer. The others laughed, and he set down a curled paper covered with diagrams. I caught sight of the rough ink outline of a rabbit, splayed apart, incision cuts marked with dotted lines. This, too, was familiar. I snatched the paper. The boy protested but I turned my back on him. My ears roared with a warm crackling. The whole room suddenly felt distant, as though I was watching myself react. I knew this diagram. The tight handwriting. The black, dotted incision lines. From somewhere deep within, I recognized it.  
  
¬† Behind me, the surgeon remarked to another boy in a whisper, ‚ÄúIntestines of a flesh-toned color. Pulsing slightly, likely from an unfinished digestion. Yes‚Äîthere, I see the contents moving. ‚Äù  
  
¬† With shaking fingers I unfolded the paper‚Äôs dog-eared right corner. Initials were scrawled on the diagram: H. M. Blood rushed in my ears, drowning out the sound of the boys and the rabbit and the clicking electric light. H. M. ‚ÄîHenri Moreau.  
  
¬† My father.  
  
¬† Through his old diagram, these boys had resurrected my father‚Äôs ghost in the very theater where he used to teach. I was flooded with a shivering uneasiness. As a child I‚Äôd worshipped my father, and now I hated him for abandoning us. Mother had fervently denied the rumors were true, but I wondered if she just couldn‚Äôt bear to have married a monster.  
  
¬† Suddenly the rabbit jolted and let out a scream so unnatural that I instinctively made the sign of the cross.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood lord,‚Äù Adam said, watching with wide eyes. ‚ÄúJones, you cad, it‚Äôs waking up!‚Äù  
  
¬† Jones rushed to the table, lined with steel blades and needles the length of my forearm. ‚ÄúI gave it the proper dose,‚Äù he stuttered, searching through the glass vials.  
  
¬† The rabbit‚Äôs screams pierced my skull. I slammed my hands against the table, the paper falling to the side. ‚ÄúEnd this,‚Äù I cried. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in pain!‚Äù  
  
¬† Lucy sobbed. The surgeon didn‚Äôt move. Frustrated, I grabbed him by the sleeve. ‚ÄúDo something! Put it out of its misery. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Still, none of the boys moved. As medical students, they should have been trained for any situation. But they were frozen. So I acted instead.  
  
¬† On the table beside me was the set of operating instruments. I wrapped my hand around the handle of the ax, normally used for separating the sternum of cadavers. I took a deep breath, focusing on the rabbit‚Äôs neck. In a movement I knew had to be fast and hard, I brought down the ax.  
  
¬† The rabbit‚Äôs screaming stopped.  
  
¬† The awful tension in my chest dripped out onto the wet floor. I stared at the ax, distantly, my brain not yet connecting it with the blood on my hands. The ax fell from my grasp, crashing to the floor. Everyone flinched.  
  
¬† Everyone but me.  
  
¬† Lucy grabbed my shoulder. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leaving,‚Äù she said, her voice strained. I swallowed. The diagram lay on the table, a cold reminder of my father‚Äôs hand in all this. I snatched it and whirled on the dark-haired boy.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere did you get this?‚Äù I demanded.  
  
¬† He only gaped.  
  
¬† I shook him, but the surgeon interrupted. ‚ÄúBillingsgate. The Blue Boar Inn. ‚Äù His eyes flashed to the ax on the floor. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a doctor there. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Lucy‚Äôs hand tightened in mine. I stared at the ax. Someone bent down to pick it up, hesitantly. Adam. Our eyes met and I saw his horror at what I‚Äôd done, and more‚Äîdisgust. Lucy was wrong. He wouldn‚Äôt want to marry me. I was cold, strange, and monstrous to those boys, just like my father. No one could love a monster.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCome on. ‚Äù She tugged me through the hallways to the street outside. It was cold, but my numb skin barely felt it. A few people passed us, bundled up, too concerned about the weather to notice the blood on our clothes. Lucy leaned against a brick wall and pressed a hand over her chest. ‚ÄúMy God, you cut its head off!‚Äù  
  
¬† Blood was on my hands, on the tattered lace of my sleeves, even dotting the tiny diamond ring my mother had left me. I stared at the paper in my fist. The Blue Boar Inn. The Blue Boar Inn. I couldn‚Äôt let myself forget that name.  
  
¬† Lucy took both my hands in hers, shaking me. ‚ÄúJuliet, say something!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey shouldn‚Äôt have done that,‚Äù I said, feeling feverish in the cold night air. The paper was damp from my sweating palms. ‚ÄúI had . . . I had to stop it. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I felt her hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúOf course you did. Our cook kills a brace of hares for dinner all the time. That‚Äôs all you did‚Äîkilled a rabbit that was already going to die. ‚Äù But her voice was shaking. What I had done was unnatural, and we both knew it.  
  
¬† A cold breeze blew off the Thames, carrying the pungent smell of sweat and Lucy‚Äôs perfume. I drew a shallow breath. The rumors of so long ago crept through the streets, coming back to life. All I had were slips of memories of my father: the feel of his tweed jacket, the smell of tobacco in his hair when he kissed me good night. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to believe my father was the madman they said he was. But I‚Äôd been so young when it happened, just ten years old. As I matured, more memories surfaced. Deeper ones, of a cold, sterile room and sounds in the night‚Äîrecollections that never entirely disappeared, no matter how far I pushed them into the recesses of my mind.

    The thing is that I have a girlfriend (was?), who was a trauma walking on 2 legs, she was abused a lot, raped (several times), then she almost committed suicide. Her biological father left her, then on his deathbed she denied her as his daughter. Her previous relationships were horrible, she was with her ex for 3 years, who did almost nothing, the girl cleaned, washed, cooked, went shopping and worked for her, the sex was not good either.
    
    We met 3 months after their final breakup, she wasn't really looking for anyone, but she liked me so much that we started talking. She really liked my body, my soul, and really, as if we were soulmates, and I would be happy if she could be herself next to me)
    From the first moment, we both felt like we were soulmates, and she also put a lot into the relationship. sHe wrote me love poems, picked flowers several times, wrote to me every morning, always went to work, always asked how my day was going, what I did, always took pictures for me.

3 weeks ago she spent a few days with me and she said I reminded her how good it was to simply be with me, how good the baths, the walks, the romantic dinner were, but the best thing was that she experienced these things with me, and when she looked at me, she knew she was in the right place. When she couldn't understand because of the family, I said it's okay, family comes first, and she thanked me for being so understanding and I hope these will be lasting experiences for both of us. Her mother invited me to her wedding, and she was happy that I could get along with everyone so well, I even got into the family photo album. I gave her a framed poem with rose petals on her birthday, and she put it out, showed her mother how happy she was and told her several times how special she felt with me.

After that, I stayed with him for 4 days, she wanted to spend a long weekend with me. We watched a movie, we were romantic, she said that I was his Gomez, when I threw a coin at the fountain and told him to make a wish, she said that his wish had already come true with me. sHe pointed to an elderly couple on Gesztenyesor and said: Huh? sHe constantly planned events with me, invited me to an antique shop, she even chose the place for our very first date, she wanted to camp on the Danube bank with me, play Lego, paint together, she wanted to go to the Nutcracker with me in November.

Then came Saturday. We went to her mother's for her birthday. We had a great time, she always snuggled up to me, told me how much she loved being with me, and when I jokingly referred to her as ""my wife"", she asked, completely touched, ""awww am I your wife?"". Her mother called her husband my father-in-law. I have a very good relationship with all of them, her grandmother said that she doesn't believe in God, but the fact that we met was a miracle, and she told the girl not to let go, to which she replied that ""it won't be up to her"".

But in the evening, the rape came up. Then she became withdrawn, not really daring to open up about his feelings because she was afraid of them. Before we went to bed, she told me that she had sobbed for 15 minutes in the shower. The next day, she carved our monograms into a heart on his favorite bench, and in the evening she asked me how I wanted to sleep, but she said it didn't matter, just hug me. She was a little boy, she put his arm around my neck and put it under his cheek. When I wanted to go to the bathroom,she pulled me closer, tighter, and in his sleep she asked ""do you love me?"" - when I said I really did, she continued sleeping with a satisfied, happy murmur. In the morning, she made coffee, had breakfast before work, told me to come in for a cigarette, then kissed me, we told each other that we loved each other and asked me to write when I got home.

Even last week she was so nice to me, she kept sending me pictures, videos of himself, insta reels saying ""US?"", but she sent me a poem that said how scared she was, how much doubt hse had. On Thursday I wrote him one too, to which she wrote that his past traumas, mistakes, things that even she couldn't accept and I embrace him with a love that gives him a love and security that he's never felt before, the next morning she wrote to me that she hoped I had a wonderful day.

We talked again on Saturday, she said she wanted to tell me something, we chatted and she added that ""I don't understand how you can say you love me if you don't even know me""

And on Sunday she wrote that she thought a lot about himself, about me, about us and that she came to the conclusion that she was not yet capable of committing, that she did not feel love. Sometimes she did, but these feelings went away after 1-2 days. she is not capable of continuing, but she does not want to let go either, because she loves me as a person, let's remain friends. And that you can't plan long-term with him, because once she sets his mind to something, it's done and she can't change it (despite the fact that she asked at the beginning that she wanted a long-term relationship with me) I told him to put the topic on ice and discuss it in person.

I also tried to talk to her mother, because the girl advised me to feel free to contact her if I had any problems. Her mother said at first that she would not influence her daughter's decision, but the next day she wrote that she had spoken to her (the girl said it was too fast for her) to think it over carefully, and what she came to understand was that her daughter was afraid of a good relationship and thought she didn't deserve it, but she hoped she would come to her senses.

* by the way, the girl really has a lot of bad experiences, she asked me several times how I could get along with her, and that she didn't deserve it. Even her sister said that she was happy for me because I was a good influence on her and more balanced.

After the break-up text, she changed the text in his bio to My soul is always with you..ü•Ä ü•Ä and posted a song with the lyrics: ""I don't know how to get you off my mind You make Hell our paradise Loving you is suicide And I do it every night Baby, I won't break Give me your worst, but you're still the only one I crave You don't love me right But I still want it anyways this too with a wilting rose

And yesterday, with a burning heart: I shouldn't have fallen in love Look what it made me become I let you get too close Just to wake up alone And I know you think you can run You're scared to believe I'm the one But I just can't let you goI'd let the world burn Let the world burn for you This is how it always had to end

Then HALF AN HOUR later she texted me asking if I could come get my stuff one day, reposting a reel with the caption ""Me running back to the person I told him I would never talk to again""

What do you think caused this drastic change? On Saturday she was still in love with me, a week later it was too fast for him and she still doesn't feel it. Because someone who does things like this to someone else, like she does to me, definitely doesn't just see the other person as a friend, but is in love. On Saturday she only hearts the birthdays we're together on, posts on Instagram with hearts and a Weeknd song saying ""You know my heart belongs to you"", and then a week later we're friends.

What do you think, does she want to break up with me for good? How should I behave with him on Sunday? Obviously he has a lot of emotions, but these signs he's sending, the ones he wrote before, don't tell me she wants to end it. He's quite an avoidant type, I think he's afraid that we suddenly got too close to each other--> he'll lose control, which is key after his traumas, or maybe he's afraid of a good relationship because it's unknown territory, or maybe she's afraid that if he lets us get closer, but we break up, it'll only be more painful?

I was seeing a guy for a few months. In the beginning, he was really keen, and I was more reserved. He seemed kind and gentlemanly. 

Then, as I started to get feelings, he just changed. Started pulling away and eventually kind of just ghosted me. 

It's really hurt me, but he did tell me he has BPD. I didn't want to judge him as a disorder, so I decided not to look into it too much. 
I dont know why I can't accept that this is what's happened. I think because it hasn't been as black and white as I've read. Like he hasn't been abusive or hateful. More dismissive. 

He's very up and down. Like one minut,  he likes me, the next he doesn't. He'll go from texting me all the time to not at all. I think it's over, then he'll randomly text again or ask me to go for coffee.

And when I confront him, it's always me who stopped talking to him as far as he's concerned, even though it was him who changed, not me.
It's really confusing, and I can never tell how he actually feels. 
So, did he split? Is this classic bpd? I find it shocking how different his behaviour is towards me now vs. the start. But he still talks to me (we run into each other sometimes), almost like nothing has happened. 

It's like he doesn't even understand why I would be upset with him. This is a man who was saying he was in love with me a few months ago, to barely speaking to me. And then he'll be like, ""Oh, hi,"" as if we're acquaintances. 

I suppose Im just looking for some confirmation, I've got issues of my own with abandonment and rejection, so it's hard not to blame myself. Is this just a man being a man? Or is it out of his control?

On top of that the company itself is a great company, they throw some great parties and we were an esop company that got bought out, so at the age of 22 I already have a little over 200k in retirement. This week I got a little sick on Monday evening, so I took Tuesday off, and then my alternator went out so I stayed home Wednesday as well. Anytime I normally take time off it's so I can go on some sort of vacation, and my weekends are almost always busy with one thing or another, so I don't normally have more than a day or so of doing next to nothing, this week I'm now on my 4th day of just chilling out at home and doing nothing stressful other than replacing my alternator (it was a bit of a pain cause my engine bay has almost no extra room) and man, I really feel so good. I need a part from the hardware store to finish doing my alternator, so my wife dropped me off and then went to see a friend, so I wondered around the store and then got what I needed and started walking home, stopped at a coffee shop on the way and just decided to get this drink I hadn't heard of before and it was great!

1mr6u1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowboarding/comments/1mr6u1j/bootfitter_advice_needed_foot_cramps_every_time/,Bootfitter advice needed - Foot cramps every time,"Guys, I've been riding 3-7 days per year for 13 years and the pain is getting worse every year. I'm ready to quit if I can't fix this. I'm even considering switching to step-ons if that makes the pain go away. Please help!

Sorry for yet another foot pain post. I live in Austin and there's no experienced bootfitters here. I don't know what else to do so I'm posting here. I'm looking for advice specific to my situation, but if other people are helped, that's all the better. I'll post as much detail as possible and include photos below.

  
**What I want help with**

Sharp continuous pain across the arches of both feet while riding. It feels like a sustained foot cramp. Possibly it's worse when on my toe edge. When its at its worst it brings tears to my eyes and I can't take in full breaths. It's worse on the first day of the season. The pain doesn't completely go away until a few minutes after unstrapping. After an hour or two of riding it usually stops happening but generally starts up again the next day of riding. This has been happening for years but it's been getting steadily worse - sharper pain and lasts longer into the day.

**What I've tried**

* I haven't noticed any heel lift, squishing of toes or extra toe room.
* A foot doctor was completely unhelpful, didn't understand how snowboards work.
* The guy at my local snowboard gear shop said my boots fit correctly but recommended snowboard insoles, which made the pain worse. See below.
* Arch support insoles - Anything thicker than the default footbeds makes it worse. I think because my feet have less vertical space.
* Ibuprofen - doesn't seem to help even if I take 4 Advil before riding
* Massage gun to calves and arches before/after - helps a little actually 

**Notes**

1. I get a foot cramp in my day to day just randomly like every other week. I can stop it instantly if I put weight on my foot or massage the arch with the edge of the coffee table.
2. This pain is hard to reproduce intentionally outside of actual snowboarding even with my boots and board strapped on. This doesn‚Äôt happen when I wakeboard even though I use Hyperlite ""System"" snowboard-style laced boots & bindings.

  
**My Gear and Stats**

* 5' 7"" 165 lb. 47 year old male
* Left foot: 10^(5/8) x 4^(1/8) inches - US 10.5 D(medium width)
* Right foot: 10^(3/4) x 4^(1/16) inches - US 10.5 D(medium width)
* Burton Ruler boots size US 10 & Burton Mission size L (10+) bindings, purchased Dec 2020
   * Note: The bindings seem too big for the boots so I have to ratchet everything to the max to feel snug
* Stance: 15/15 16.5 inches apart at center of board

1mr6thw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerCheck/comments/1mr6thw/explore_if_the_best_mini_rice_cooker_by_white/,Explore if the Best Mini Rice Cooker by WHITE TIGER Delivers,"Sometimes simplicity makes life so much easier, doesn‚Äôt it? I recently got my hands on the WHITE TIGER White Tiger 1818 Mini Rice Cooker, and let me tell you, it‚Äôs been quite the experience cooking with this little wonder. From steaming rice in a flash to trying out oatmeal and soups on a busy morning, this gadget is a game-changer for small households or people like me who prefer compact yet functional kitchen appliances. It‚Äôs not every day you come across a rice cooker that doesn‚Äôt just stop at rice. This beautifully designed 1-liter mini rice cooker has a surprising amount of tricks up its sleeve‚Äîall while taking up barely any counter space.

**Compact Design with a Lightweight Build**  
The size alone had me hooked. Measuring just 6.5 inches in depth, width, and slightly taller in height, it‚Äôs so tiny that it could probably fit into a tote bag. There are days when I think it could be mistaken for a fancy lunchbox. Despite its small form factor, it feels sturdy with its aluminum and plastic build, balanced perfectly by lightweight portability. Weighing in at just 2.55 pounds, lugging it around (whether across rooms or on trips) is no effort at all. As someone with limited kitchen counter real estate, this easily slots in next to the coffee machine. Its sleek, all-white design adds a minimalist vibe, which I personally love.

**Performance and Cooking Efficiency**  
Now here‚Äôs the part that really won me over: the cooking. This mini rice cooker claims to whip up rice in a super-fast 15 minutes, and I was a little skeptical at first. But after a couple of runs, I realized it wasn‚Äôt just a tall claim. Whether I‚Äôm cooking jasmine rice or even simple white rice, it remains consistent. Of course, heartier grains like brown rice took a tad longer, but that‚Äôs expected. Beyond rice, I‚Äôve used it to make soups, stews, and even oatmeal. The keep-warm function is what truly sealed the deal for me. If I get busy and forget about it, no worries‚Äîthe keep-warm setting ensures my food is perfectly heated every single time.

[Check WHITE TIGER White Tiger 1818 price on Amazon.](https://alluringdeals.com/p/b07q81zpgv/)

**User-Friendly Features and Accessories**  
What I found most thoughtful is the inclusion of a PFOA-free non-stick pot. This made cleaning a breeze. Honestly, there‚Äôs nothing worse than scrubbing stubborn food residue after a long day. The heat dissipation port is a brilliant touch too, as it ensures the cooker doesn‚Äôt overheat, extending its lifespan. Another thing I should highlight is the measuring cup and rice paddle that come with the cooker. For a newbie cook or someone who isn‚Äôt into precise measurements (like me), this convenience makes the whole cooking process foolproof. However, I wish there were additional custom timer settings‚Äîit‚Äôs a one-size-fits-most approach here.  

**Strengths**  
- Compact and portable design perfect for small kitchens or travel.  
- Extremely user-friendly, even for beginners.  
- Multi-purpose functionality: rice, oatmeal, soup, and stews.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Limited capacity makes it less suitable for households larger than two people.  
- Lacks additional timer customization beyond the default settings.  

**Product Alternatives**  
While testing this rice cooker, I also looked into similar products to compare its strengths. The DASH Mini Rice Cooker is one that comes to mind. It‚Äôs equally compact but offers fewer features‚Äîit lacks a keep-warm function, for instance. Another option is the Aroma Housewares Mini Cooker, which has a slightly larger capacity but is bulkier in design. What I really appreciated about the White Tiger model over these competitors is its balance of portability and versatility. The Aroma cooker might suit families better, as it offers options like steaming trays, but for someone like me, with simple rice and side-dish needs, those extras felt unnecessary.

**Quality for Price**  
Instead of outright asking, ‚ÄúIs it worth it?‚Äù I‚Äôd reframe it like this‚Äîwhat are you paying for? With this mini rice cooker, you‚Äôre getting time efficiency, portability, and multi-purpose functionality wrapped into one compact package. Given how consistently it performs across dishes, I‚Äôd say it delivers solid value, especially for single users or couples. Sure, there are other options with slightly more features, but unless those features are non-negotiable for you, this little guy ticks all the essential boxes.

A lot of people said that it‚Äôs a spot on dupe of YSL black opium, and since my sister has the OG Black Opium (which she does not let me use often) and I really love it, I wanted to see if it matches the fragrance. And trust me guys, it‚Äôs true. I can say it‚Äôs an 85% match!

I used it the other day and my sister thought I used her BO lol, so yeah, the scent it quite similar.

Unlike BO, you do get a strong whiff of alcohol when you spray it, but then it settles down in the next 5-10 mins where you actually smell the scent. And yes, it doesn‚Äôt exactly smell like coffee, but so does BO.

The only difference is that Black Opium has a lingering smell. Like, If you move out of an elevator, it‚Äôll still smell of your perfume for the next few minutes. But that‚Äôs not the case with Espresso Vanilla. You need to get really close to smell it and it doesn‚Äôt stay on the skin for long (maybe that‚Äôs because I travel a lot, I change two metros and then walk for 10 mins to reach office) but yes it stays on the clothes. I wore it yesterday and I can still smell it on my T-shirt today. I got a few compliments too in the office yesterday.

So overall I can say it‚Äôs a good dupe for this price range. I‚Äôm really happy with this purchase.

## Key Features Analysis

The modern 12 cup ‚Å£coffee pot has evolved considerably, offering an‚Äå array of features that‚Äç enhance the brewing process and overall user experience. Understanding these key features is crucial for making an informed decision.

**Brew Strength Control**

Brew strength control ‚Äçallows users to customize the ‚Äåintensity of their coffee. Many modern 12 cup coffee pots offer‚Äç settings for regular,bold,or even ‚Äåiced coffee.‚Å§ this is often achieved ‚Äåby adjusting the water flow‚Å§ rate and the steep time, allowing for a more complete extraction of the ‚Äåcoffee‚Å§ grounds. For example, ‚Å£a ""bold""‚Å§ setting might slow down the water flow to allow the hot water to remain ‚Å£in contact with the grounds for a longer ‚Å£period, resulting in a richer, more robust cup ‚Å¢of coffee.

**Programmable timer**

A programmable timer‚Å£ is a highly convenient feature, enabling users ‚Å¢to preset the coffee maker to‚Äç automatically brew coffee at a specified time. this feature is particularly useful‚Äç for those who like to wake up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Most programmable timers are easy‚Äç to set, usually involving a‚Å§ simple selection of the desired brew time using digital controls.‚Äã More advanced models may even allow for different brew times on‚Å£ different days of the week.

**Keep Warm Function**

The keep warm function is standard on most 12 cup coffee pots, ‚Å¢maintaining the temperature of the brewed coffee for a specified period, typically ranging from one to four hours. Some models ‚Äåallow users to adjust ‚Äãthe length of the keep ‚Å§warm cycle, while others have an automatic shutoff feature to prevent the coffee from‚Å¢ scorching and reduce energy consumption. The ‚Äåeffectiveness of the‚Äå keep warm function can vary significantly,with some models maintaining a‚Å£ consistent temperature while others experience a gradual decline in heat.

**Water Filtration System**

Some higher-end 12 cup coffee pots incorporate ‚Äãa built-in water filtration system to improve the taste of the coffee. These systems typically use charcoal filters to‚Äå remove chlorine,sediment,and other impurities ‚Äçfrom ‚Äåthe water before brewing.‚Äç A water filtration system‚Äå can significantly enhance the flavor profile of the coffee, resulting in a cleaner, smoother, and more flavorful brew. The frequency of filter replacement varies depending on the model and the water quality in your area.

Key features of the advanced 12 cup coffee pots include:

*‚Å£ Precise temperature control
* Automatic shut-off functionality
* ‚ÄåUser-pleasant digital interface
*‚Äã Durable and aesthetic exterior design

##‚Äå Core ‚Å£Benefits

Investing in a quality 12 cup coffee pot offers a range of ‚Å§benefits that go beyond simply brewing coffee. These benefits cater to‚Å£ convenience, efficiency, and the ‚Äãquality of the brewed beverage.

**Enhanced‚Äã Convenience:** A 12 cup ‚Å§coffee pot provides enhanced convenience, especially for households with multiple coffee drinkers ‚Äãor those who frequently entertain guests. Brewing a full pot at once eliminates the need for multiple brewing‚Å§ cycles, saving time and effort. Furthermore, features‚Å£ like programmable timers and automatic ‚Å¢shut-off increase the overall convenience of‚Äç making and enjoying‚Äå coffee.

**Cost Savings:** While the‚Äç initial investment in a 12 ‚Äãcup ‚Äåcoffee pot may seem ‚Äånotable, it can lead to cost ‚Å¢savings in the long run. Brewing coffee at home is generally less expensive than purchasing coffee from a coffee shop on a daily‚Å§ basis.additionally, brewing larger ‚Å§batches of coffee can reduce‚Å§ waste compared to single-serve coffee makers, as you are less likely to‚Äç discard ‚Äãunused portions.

**Improved Coffee Quality:**‚Äå Many advanced 12 cup coffee pots incorporate features that enhance the quality of the brewed coffee.Precise temperature control, water filtration systems, ‚Äãand brew strength settings contribute to a richer, more flavorful,‚Äç and satisfying coffee experience. These features allow ‚Äçusers ‚Äçto‚Å¢ customize the brewing process‚Å£ to their ‚Å§specific preferences, resulting ‚Äãin a more consistent and enjoyable cup of‚Äã coffee.

## FAQs Section

Making ‚Äãthe right choice for a 12 cup coffee pot involves considering many questions regarding ‚Äåfunctionality, compatibility, and‚Å¢ maintenance. Here are a ‚Å¢few common consumer ‚Å¢questions‚Äç answered:

**How often ‚Äãshould I‚Å¢ clean my 12 cup coffee‚Äå pot?**
It's recommended to clean‚Å£ your 12 cup coffee pot at least once a‚Äã month to remove mineral buildup and coffee residue. depending on the‚Äç hardness of your ‚Å¢water, you may need ‚Å£to clean it more‚Å£ frequently.‚Äç You‚Äã can use a ‚Äåsolution of ‚Äåequal parts white vinegar and water, run‚Å¢ it through a full brewing cycle, and then rinse thoroughly with fresh water.

**can I ‚Å¢use pre-ground coffee in‚Äã a 12 cup coffee pot?**
Yes, you can use pre-ground ‚Å£coffee in a 12 cup coffee pot. However, for optimal flavor, it's‚Å£ generally recommended to use freshly ground coffee beans. ‚ÄãPre-ground coffee tends to lose its ‚Äãflavor and aroma more quickly‚Å§ than whole beans, so grinding your own beans just before brewing will result in a fresher, ‚Äåmore flavorful cup of coffee.

**What type of filter should I use?**
Most 12 cup coffee pots use either paper filters or permanent filters. Paper filters ‚Å¢are disposable and provide a clean, sediment-free brew. Permanent filters, typically made of mesh, are reusable and ‚Å¢more environmentally friendly but may ‚Äåallow some sediment to pass through.The choice between paper and permanent filters depends on your ‚Äåpersonal preference and tolerance for sediment in‚Äç your coffee.

¬† Tucking my hair back, I squinted at the parchment, trying to form the strange angular letters as smoothly as I could. The ink glistened wetly, but it wasn't red ink, it was blood - my blood - which might account for the slight tremble as I copied the awkward-looking name scripted in characters that weren't English. Beside me was a pile of rejects. If I didn't get it perfect this time, I'd be bleeding yet again. God help me, I was doing a black curse. In a demon's kitchen. On the weekend. How in hell had I gotten here?  
  
¬† Algaliarept stood poised between the slate table and the smaller hearth, his white-gloved hands behind his back. He looked like a stuffy Brit in a murder mystery, and when he shifted impatiently, my tension spiked. ""That isn't helping,"" I said dryly, and his red, goat-slitted eyes widened in mocking surprise, peering at me over his smoked spectacles. He didn't need them for reading. From his crushed green velvet frock to his lace cuffs and proper English accent, the demon was all about show.  
  
¬† ""It has to be exact, Rachel, or it won't capture the aura,"" he said, his attention sliding to the small green bottle on the table. ""Trust me, you don't want that floating around unbound. ""  
  
¬† I sat up and felt my back crack. As I touched the quill tip to my throbbing finger, my unease grew. I was a white witch, damn it, not black. But I wasn't going to write off demon magic just because of a label. I'd read the recipe; I'd interpreted the invocation. Nothing died to provide the ingredients, and the only person who'd suffer would be me. I'd come away from this with a new layer of demon smut on my soul, but I'd also have protection against banshees. After one had nearly killed me last New Year's Eve, I'd willingly entertain a little smut to be safe. Besides, this might lead to a way to save Ivy's soul when she died her first death. For that, I'd risk a lot.  
  
¬† Something, though, felt wrong. Al's squint at the aura bottle was worrisome, and his accent was too precise tonight. He was concerned and trying to hide it. It couldn't be the curse. It was just manipulating an aura, captured energy from a soul. At least. . . that's what he said.  
  
¬† Frowning, I glanced at Al's cramped handwritten instructions. I wanted to go over them again, but his peeved expression and his soft growl convinced me it could wait until the scripting was done. My ""ink"" was running thin, and I dabbed more blood from my finger to finish some poor slob's name, someone who trusted a demon. . . someone like me. Not that I really trust Al, I thought, glancing at the instructions once more.  
  
¬† Al's spelling kitchen was right out of a fantasy flick, one of four rooms he had recovered after selling almost everything to keep his demon ass out of demon-ass jail. The gray stone walls made a large circular space, most of which was covered in identical tall wooden cabinets with glass doors. Behind the rippled glass, Al kept his books and ley-line equipment. The biological ingredients were in a cellar to which access was through a rough hole in the floor. Smoky support beams a good forty feet up came to a point over a central fire pit. The pit itself was a round, raised affair, with vent holes to draw the cold floor air in by way of simple convection. When it got going, it made a comfortable spot for reading, and when fatigue brought me down, Al let me nap on the benches bracketing it. Mr. Fish, my beta, swam in his little bowl on the mantel of the smaller fire in the fireplace. I don't know why I'd brought him from home. It had been Ivy's idea, and when an anxious vampire tells you to take your fish, you take your fish.  
  
¬† Al cleared his throat, and I jumped, fortunately having pulled my quill from the parchment an instant before. Done, thank God. ""Good?"" I asked, holding it up for inspection, and his white-gloved, thick-fingered hand pinched it at the edge where it wouldn't smear.  
  
¬† He eyed it, my tension easing when he handed it back. ""Passable. Now the bowl. ""  
  
¬† Passable. That was usually as good as it got, and I set the painstakingly scribed bit of paper beside the unlit candle and green bottle of aura, taking up Al's favorite scribing knife and the palm-size earthen bowl. The knife was ugly, the writhing woman on the handle looking like demon porn. Al knew I hated it, which was why he insisted I use it.  
  
¬† The gray bowl was rough in my hand, the inside inscribed with scratched-off words of power. Only the newly scribed name I was etching would react. The theory was to burn the paper and take in the man's name by way of air, then drink water from the bowl, taking in his name by water. This would hit all four elements, earth and water with the bowl, air and fire with the burning parchment. Heaven and earth, with me in the middle. Yippy skippy.  
  
¬† The foreign-looking characters were easier after having practiced with the parchment, and I had it scratched on a tiny open space before Al could sigh more than twice. He'd taken up the bottle of aura, frowning as he gazed into the swirling green.  
  
¬† ""What?"" I offered, trying to keep the annoyance from my voice. I was his student, sure, but he would still try to backhand me if I got uppity.  
  
¬† Al's brow furrowed, worrying me even more. ""I don't like this aura's resonance,"" he said softly, red eyes probing the glass pinched in his white-clad fingers.  
  
¬† I shifted my weight on my padded chair, trying to stretch my legs. ""And?""  
  
¬† Al's focus shifted over his glasses to me. ""It's one of Newt's. ""  
  
¬† ""Newt? Since when do you need to get an aura from Newt?"" I asked. No one liked the insane demon, but she was the reigning queen of the lost boys, so to speak, and knew everything - when she could remember it.  
  
¬† ""Not your concern,"" he said, and I winced, embarrassed. Al had lost almost everything in his effort to snag me as a familiar, ending up with something vastly more precious but broke just the same. I was a witch, but a common, usually lethal genetic fault had left me able to kindle their magic. Al's status was assured as long as I was his student, but his living was bleak.  
  
¬† ""I'll just pop over and find out who it is before we finish this up,"" he said with forced lightness, setting the bottle down with a sharp tap.  
  
¬† I looked at the assembled pieces. ""Now? Why didn't you ask her before?""  
  
¬† ""It didn't seem important at the time,"" he said, looking mildly discomfited. ""Pierce!"" he shouted, the call for his familiar lost in the high ceilings coated in shadows and dust. Mood sour, he turned to me. ""Don't touch anything while I'm gone. ""  
  
¬† ""Sure,"" I said distantly, eying the green swirling in the bottle. He had to borrow an aura from Newt? Jeez, maybe things were worse off than I'd thought.  
  
¬† ""The crazy bitch has a reason for everything, though she might not remember it,"" Al said as he tugged his sleeves over his lace cuffs. Glancing at the arranged spelling supplies, he hesitated. ""Go ahead and fill the bowl. Make sure the water covers the name. "" He looked at the image of an angry, screaming face scribed into his black marble floor. It was his version of a door in the doorless room. ""Gordian Nathaniel Pierce!""  
  
¬† I pushed back from the table as the witch popped into the kitchen atop the grotesque face, a dish towel over his shoulder and his sleeves rolled up. ""I'd be of a mind to know what the almighty hurry is,"" the man from the early 1800s said as he tossed his hair from his eyes and unrolled his sleeves. ""I swan, the moment I start something, you get in a pucker over nothing. ""  
  
¬† ""Shut up, runt,"" Al muttered, knowing that to backhand him would start a contest that would end with Pierce unconscious and a big mess to clean up. It was easier to ignore him. Al had snared the clever witch within an hour of his first escape, the demon taking great pains to keep us apart during my weekly lessons until Al realized I was ticked with Pierce for having willingly gone into partnership with Al. Partnership? Hell, call it what it was. Slavery.  
  
¬† Oh, I was  
still impressed with Pierce's magic, which far outstripped mine. His quick one-liners, in his odd accent, aimed at Al when the demon wasn't listening still made me smirk. And I wasn't looking at his long, wavy hair, or his lanky build, much less his tight ass, damn it. But some time shortly after seeing him naked under Carew Tower's restaurant, I'd lost the teenage crush I'd had on him. It might have been his insufferable confidence, or the fact that he wouldn't admit how deep in the crapper he was, or that he was just a little too good at demon magic, but for whatever reason, that devilish smile that had once sparked through me now fell flat.  
  
¬† ""I'm stepping out for a tick,"" Al said as he buttoned his coat. ""Merely checking something. A tidy curse is a well-twisted one! Pierce, make yourself useful and help her with her Latin while I'm gone. Her syntax sucks. ""  
  
¬† ""Gee, thanks. "" The modern phrases sounded odd with Al's accent.  
  
¬† ""And don't let her do anything stupid,"" he added as he adjusted his glasses.  
  
¬† ""Hey!"" I exclaimed, but my eyes darted to the creepy tapestry whose figures seemed to move when I wasn't looking. There were things in Al's kitchen that it was best not to be alone with, and I appreciated the company. Even if it was Pierce.  
  
¬† ""As the almighty Al wishes,"" Pierce said dryly, earning a raised eyebrow before Al vanished from where he stood, using a ley line to traverse the ever-after to get to Newt's rooms.  
  
¬† In an instant, the lights went out, but before I could move, they flashed back to life, markedly brighter as Pierce took over the charm, telling me it wasn't the demon-curse light charm I knew. Alone. How. . . nice. I watched him meticulously drape his damp dish towel to dry on the top of the cushioned bench that circled the central fire pit, and then, jaw clenched, I looked away. Standing, I moved to keep the slate table between us as Pierce crossed the room with the grace of another time.  
  
¬† ""What is the invocation today?"" he asked, and I pointed to it on the table, wanting to look at it again myself but willing to wait. His hair fell over his eyes as he studied it.  
  
¬† ""Sunt qui discessum animi a corpore putent esse mortem. Sunt erras"" he said softly, his blue eyes shocking against his dark hair as he looked up. ""You're working with souls?""  
  
¬† ""Auras,"" I corrected him, but his expression was doubtful. There are those who believe that the departure of the soul from the body is death. They are wrong, I silently translated, then took it from him to set it with the bottle of aura, bowl, and the name scribed with my blood. ""Hey, if you can't trust your demon, who can you trust?"" I said sarcastically, gathering up the pile of discarded signature attempts and moving them out of the way to the mantel. But I didn't trust Al, and I itched to look at the curse again. Not with Pierce, though. He'd want to help me with my Latin.  
  
¬† The tension rose at my continued silence, and Pierce half-sat on the slate table, one long leg hanging down. He was watching me, making me nervous as I filled the inscribed bowl from a pitcher. It was just plain water, but it smelled faintly of burnt amber. No wonder I go home with headaches, I thought, grimacing as I overfilled the bowl and water dribbled out.  
  
¬† ""I'll get that,"" Pierce said, jumping from the table and reaching for his dish towel.  
  
¬† ""Thanks, I'm good,"" I snapped, snatching the cloth from him and doing it myself.  
  
¬† He drew back, looking hurt as he stood before the fire pit. ""I'll allow I've gotten myself in a powerful fix, Rachel, but what have I done to turn you so cold?""  
  
¬† My motion to clean the slate slowed, and I turned with a sigh. The truth of it was, I wasn't sure. I only knew that the things that had attracted me once now looked childish and inane. He'd been a ghost, more or less, and had agreed to be Al's familiar if the demon could give him a body. Al had shoved his soul into a dead witch before the body even had the chance to skip a heartbeat. It didn't help that I'd known the guy Al had put his soul into. I didn't think I could take another person's body to save myself. But then, I'd never been dead before.  
  
¬† I looked at Pierce now, seeing the same reckless determination, the same disregard for the future that had gotten me shunned, rightfully, and all I knew was that I didn't want anything to do with it. I took a breath and let it out, not knowing where to start. But a shiver lifted through me at the memory of his touch, ages ago but still fresh in my mind. Al was right. I was an idiot.  
  
¬† ""It's not going to work, Pierce,"" I said flatly, and I turned away.  
  
¬† My tone had been harsh, and Pierce's voice lost its sparkle. ""Rachel. Truly. What's wrong? I took this job to be closer to you. ""  
  
¬† ""That's just it!"" I exclaimed, and he blinked, bewildered. ""This is not a job!"" I said, waving the dish towel. ""It's slavery. You belong to him, body and soul. And you did it intentionally! We could have found another way to give you a body. Your own, maybe! But no. You just jumped right into a demon pact instead of asking for help!""  
  
¬† He came around the table, close but not quite touching me. ""I swan, a demon curse is the only way to become living again,"" he said, touching his chest. ""I know what I'm doing. This isn't forever. When I can, I'll kill the demon spawn, and then I'll be free. ""  
  
¬† ""Kill Al?"" I breathed, not believing he still thought he could.  
  
¬† ""I'll be free of him and have a body, both. "" He took my hands, and I realized how cold I was. ""Trust me, Rachel. I know what I'm doing. ""  
  
¬† Oh my God. He is as bad as I am. Was. ""You're crazy!"" I exclaimed, pulling out of his grip. ""You think you're more powerful than you are, with your black magic and whatever! Al is a demon, and I don't think you grasp what he can do. He's playing with you!""  
  
¬† Pierce leaned against the table, arms crossed and the light catching the colorful pattern of his vest. ""Do tell? You opine I don't know what I'm doing?""  
  
¬† ""I opine you don't!"" I mocked, using his own words. His attitude was infuriating, and I looked at the bowl behind him, the remnant of others who had thought they were smarter than a demon now just names on a bowl, bottles on a shelf.  
  
¬† ""Fair enough. "" Pierce scratched his chin and stood. ""I expect a body needs proof. ""  
  
¬† I stiffened. Shit. Proof? ""Hey, wait a minute,"" I said, dropping the dish towel to the table. ""What are you doing? Al brought you back, but he can take you out again, too. ""  
  
¬† Pierce impishly put a finger to his nose. ""Mayhap. But he has to catch me first. ""  
  
¬† My eyes darted to the band of charmed silver around his wrist. Pierce could jump ley lines where I couldn't, but charmed silver cut off his access to them. He couldn't leave.  
  
¬† ""What, this?"" he said confidently, and my lips parted when he ran his finger around the inside of the silver band and the metal seemed to stretch, allowing him to slip it off.  
  
¬† ""H-How,"" I stammered as he twirled it. Crap on toast. I'd be blamed for this. I knew it!  
  
¬† ""It's been tampered with so I can move from room to room here. I tampered with it a little more is all,"" Pierce said, sticking the band of silver in his back pocket, his eyes gleaming. ""I've not had a bite of food free of burnt amber in a coon's age. I'll fetch you something to warm your cold heart. ""  
  
¬† I stepped forward, panicking. ""Put that back on! If Al knows you can escape, he'll - ""  
  
¬† ""Kill me. Yeah, yeah, yeah,"" he said, hitting the modern phrase perfectly. His hand dipped into another pocket, and he studied a handful of coins. ""Al will tarry with Newt for at least fifteen minutes. I'll be right back. ""  
  
¬† His accent was thinning. Clearly he could turn it off and on at will - which worried me even more. What else was he hiding? ""You're going to get me in trouble!"" I said, but with a sly grin, he vanished. The lights he had been minding went out, and the ring of charmed silver he had stuck in his pocket made a ting as it hit the floor. My heart thumped in the sudden darkness lit only by the hearth fire and the dull glow of the banked fire pit. He was gone, and we were both going to be in deep shit if Al found out.  
  
¬† Heart pounding, I watched the creepy tapestry across the room. My mouth was dry, and the shadows shifted as the figures on it seemed to move in the firelight. Son of a bitch! I thought as I went to pick up the ring of charm  
ed silver and tuck the incriminating thing in a pocket. Al was going to blame me. He'd think I took the charmed silver off Pierce.  
  
¬† Edging back to the small hearth fire, I fumbled for the candle on the mantel, scraping wax under my nail as a focusing object, pinching the wick, and tapping a ley line to work the charm. ""Consimilis calefacio"" I said, voice quavering as a tiny slip of ley-line energy flowed through me, exciting the molecules until the wick burst into flame, but just as I did, the ley-line-powered lights flashed high, and I jumped, knocking the lit candle off the mantel.  
  
¬† ""I can explain!"" I exclaimed as I fumbled for the candle, now rolling down the mantel toward Mr. Fish. But it was Pierce, tossing his hair from his eyes and with two tall grandes in his hands. ""You idiot!"" I hissed as the candle hit the scraps of paper and in a flash, they went up.  
  
¬† ""Across lots like lightning, mistress witch,"" Pierce said, laughing as he extended a coffee.  
  
¬† God, I wish he'd speak normal English. Frantic, I brushed the bits of paper off the mantel, stepping on them once they hit the black marble floor. The stink of burning plastic joined the mess, and I grabbed the bowl of water, dumping it. Black smoke wisped up, stinging my eyes. It helped mask the reek of burning shoe, so maybe it wasn't all bad.  
  
¬† ""You ass!"" I shouted. ""Do you realize what would happen if Al came back and found you gone? Are you that inconsiderate, or just that stupid? Put this back on!""  
  
¬† Angry, I threw the ring of charmed metal at him. His hands were full, and he sidestepped it. With a thunk, the ring hit the tapestry and then the floor. Pierce's hand extending the coffee drooped, his enthusiasm fading. ""I'd do naught to hurt you, mistress witch. ""  
  
¬† ""I am not your mistress witch!"" Ignoring the coffee, I looked at the bits of burnt paper in a soggy mess on the floor. Kneeling, I snatched the dish towel from the table to sop it up. I could smell raspberry-flavored Italian blend, and my stomach growled.  
  
¬† ""Rachel,"" Pierce coaxed.  
  
¬† Pissed, I wouldn't look up at him as I wiped the floor. Standing, I tossed the towel to the table in disgust, then froze. The aura bottle wasn't green anymore.  
  
¬† ""Rachel?""  
  
¬† It was questioning this time, and I held up a hand, tasting the air as my eyes stung. Shit, I'd burned the name and gotten the charged water all over me. ""I think I'm in trouble,"" I whispered, then jerked, feeling as if my skin was on fire. Yelping, I slapped at my clothes. Panic rose as an alien aura slipped through mine, soaking in to find my soul - and squeezing.  
  
¬† Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit. I'd invoked the curse. I was in so-o-o-o much trouble. But this didn't feel right; the curse burned! Demons were wimps. They always made their magic painless unless you did it wrong. Oh God. I'd done it wrong!  
  
¬† ""Rachel?"" Pierce touched my shoulder. I met his eyes, and then I doubled over, gasping.  
  
¬† ""Rachel!"" he cried, but I was trying to breathe. It was the dead person, the one whose name I'd scribed in my own blood. It hadn't been his aura in the bottle, but his soul. And now his soul wanted a new body. Mine. Son of a bitch, Al had lied to me. I knew I should have trusted my gut and questioned him. He said it was an aura, but it was a soul, and the soul in the bottle was pissed!  
  
¬† Mine, echoed in our joined thoughts. Gritting my teeth, I bent double and tapped a ley line. Newt had once tried to possess me, and I had burned her out with a rush of energy. I gasped when a scintillating stream of it poured in with the taste of burning tinfoil, but the presence in me chortled, welcoming the flood. Mine! the soul insisted in delight, and I felt my link to the line being severed. I stumbled, falling to kneel on the cold marble. It had taken control, cutting me out!  
  
¬† No! I thought, scrambling for the line in my mind only to find nothing to grasp. My chest hurt when my heart started to beat to a new, faster rhythm. What in hell was this thing! What sort of mind could make a soul this determined? I couldn't. . . stop it!  
  
¬† ""Rachel!""  
  
¬† Eyes tearing, I blinked at Pierce, struggling to focus. ""Get. It. Out of me!""  
  
¬† He spun, motions fast as he found the unburnt signature still on the table. There was a swallow of water left in the bowl. It had to be enough.  
  
¬† I am Rachel Morgan, I thought, teeth gritted as the soul rifled through my memories like some people shake old books for money. I live in a church with a vampire and a family of pixies. I fight the had guys. And I will not let you have my body!  
  
¬† You cant stop me.  
  
¬† The thought was oily, hysteria set to discordant music. It hadn't been my thought, and I panicked. It was right, though. I was powerless to stop it, and as soon as it looked at everything and claimed what it wanted, I was going to be discarded.  
  
¬† ""Get out!"" I screamed, but its fingers reached into my heart and brain for more, and I groaned, feeling control over my body start to slip away. ""Pierce, get it out of me!"" I begged, doubled over on the cold black floor, silver etchings like threads under my cheek. Everything I didn't concentrate on was gone. The moment I lapsed, I would be too.  
  
¬† I smelled the scent of burnt paper, and the soft murmur of Latin. ""Sunt qui discessum animi a corpore putent esse mortem,' Pierce said, his hand shaking as he brushed the hair from my face. Beside him was the empty bowl. ""Sunt erras""  
  
¬† ""This is mine!"" I cried gleefully, but it wasn't me screaming. It was the soul, who had found the knowledge that my blood could invoke demon magic and held it aloft like a jewel. I got in one clean gasp of air as it was distracted, and I opened my eyes. ""Pierce. . . ,"" I whispered desperately, for his attention, then choked when the soul realized I still had some control.  
  
¬† ""Mine!"" the soul snarled with my lips, and I backhanded Pierce across the cheek.  
  
¬† Oh God, I'd lost, and I felt myself pull my legs under me to crouch before the fire like an animal. I'd lost my body to a thousand-year-old soul! My lips curled back, and I grinned at Pierce's horror, even as I tried to claw my way back into control. But even my connection to the ley line belonged to it.  
  
¬† ""Get away from her!"" I heard Al exclaim, and with the sound of smacking flesh, Pierce slid backward against the tapestry. Al.  
  
¬† Hissing, I spun to him, crouched and hands turned to claws. It is a demon, echoed in my thoughts, and hatred bubbled up, a thousand years of hatred demanding revenge.  
  
¬† I jumped at him with a howl, and Al grabbed me by the neck. I clawed at him, and he casually thunked my head into the wall. Pain reverberated between my skull and reason, and in the haze, my reactions were faster than the alien soul's. I took control, grabbed the ley line, and threw a protection bubble about the soul within me. It was still dazed from the thunk on the head, and I had the upper hand. But for how long?  
  
¬† Eyes struggling to focus, I latched onto Al's hands around my throat. God, I was never so happy to see him. ""Rachel?"" he asked, an understandable question at this point.  
  
¬† ""For a little bit longer, yeah, you son of a bitch,"" I panted, terrified as I felt the soul in me start to recover. ""You told me it was an aura. It's a goddamned soul! You lied to me! You lied to me, Al! And it's. . . taking me over, you son of a bitch!""  
  
¬† His eyes narrowed as he looked across the room at Pierce. ""I told you to watch her!""  
  
¬† ""Accident,"" Pierce said as he untangled his legs. ""She dropped a candle. The early scratchings burned, and she put it out with the water. The soul wasn't harnessed by invocation before escaping. I twisted the curse to get it out of her. I don't understand why it didn't work!""  
  
¬† Al let go of my neck and swung me into his arms, cradling me. ""You're not a demon, runt,"" he said distantly, talking to Pierce as he peered into my eyes. ""You can't hold a soul other than your own. ""  
  
¬† But Al thought I could? I took a breath as I stared at Al's red eyes, then another, feeling the soul in me begin to push against the protection circle, probing, looking for a way to regain control. I jerked when a slow flame started in my mind, burning, expanding. It howled against the inside of my skull, and my hands twitched. ""Get it. . . out!"" I forced past my clenched teeth. I couldn't fight forever.  
  
¬† Al's goat-slitted eyes showe  
d a flash of panic, and I felt him sit down before the fire, right there on the floor. ""Let me in, Rachel. Into your thoughts. You've got Krathion in there. I can separate him from you, but you have to let me in. Let go and stop fighting so I can come in!""  
  
¬† He wanted me to stop fighting? ""He'll take over!"" I panted, gripping his arm when a new wave of outrage spun through me. ""He'll kill me! Al, this soul is crazy!""  
  
¬† Al shook his head. ""I won't let you die. I've got too much invested in you. "" The look in his eyes scared me - it wasn't love, but it wasn't just the fear of losing an investment either. ""Let me in!"" he demanded as I clenched in pain. Shit, I was drooling. He didn't say trust me, but it was in his eyes.  
  
¬† Inside me, I felt the satisfaction of a steady progression of fire. I wasn't driven enough to survive this. Maybe after being imprisoned in limbo for a thousand years, but not right now. Either let Al in or the soul won. I had to trust him. ""Okay,"" I breathed, and as Al's eyes widened, I stopped fighting.  
  
¬† The soul screamed in victory, and my body shuddered. And then. . . I was nowhere. I wasn't in the echoing blackness of the demon collective, and I wasn't in the spinning, humming strength of a ley line. I was. . . nowhere, and everywhere. Centered for the first time in my life, alone and utterly understanding it all. There was no hurry, no reason, and I hung in a blissful state of no questions. Until one stirred in me. Was this where Kisten had gone?  
  
¬† I wondered suddenly, was Kist here? My dad? Was that his aftershave I smelled?  
  
¬† ""Rachel?"" someone called, and I gathered myself, trying to focus. ""Dad?"" I whispered, not believing it.  
  
¬† ""Rachel!"" The voice became louder, and I felt a sudden pain.  
  
¬† Coughing, I took a huge gasp of air, my hair in my mouth, my face. The world was upside down, but then I realized I was on my hands and knees, taking snatches of air between the dry heaves. The sour taste in my mouth fought with the stink of burnt amber pouring off me. My face hurt with each gut-wrenching clench, and I felt it carefully with shaky fingers. Someone had hit me. But I was here, alone in my body. The perverted soul was gone.  
  
¬† I looked up from Al's floor to see a pair of elegantly embroidered slippers. Sending my gaze higher, I found an androgynous robe with a martial arts look about it, and above that, Newt's mocking expression. The demon was bald again. Even her eyebrows were gone.  
  
¬† Her face wrinkled when she saw me looking at her. ""Honestly, Al, you're going to have to do better,"" she said, her words long and drawn out. ""You almost let her kill herself. Again. ""  
  
¬† Al? That must be whose hand is on my back.  
  
¬† ""Rachel?"" Al said again, close and intent. I recognized it from that in-between place Td been in. His hand fell away, and I sat back to bring my legs to my chest. Forehead on my knees, I hid from everyone. ""What's she doing here?"" I muttered, meaning Newt. Cold, I shivered.  
  
¬† ""It's her,"" he said, his relief clear as I heard him stand. ""Thank you. ""  
  
¬† ""Don't thank me. This wasn't free. "" The soft shush of her slippers was loud, but I didn't look. I was alive. I was alone in my mind. Al had been in there. No telling what he'd seen.  
  
¬† ""I ought to file charges of uncommon stupidity against you for letting her try this alone,"" Newt said dryly, and I took a deep breath. Not out of it yet, apparently.  
  
¬† ""She wouldn't have been alone if, to begin with, you'd given me a suitable soul,"" Al said, and I jumped when a blanket smelling of burnt amber fell across my shoulders. ""Krathion? Are you insane? He was a lunatic!""  
  
¬† ""One man's opinion,"" Newt said smugly, and I pulled my head up. ""And what a typical male response,"" she added, glancing at me. ""Blame everyone but yourself. You left Rachel in the middle of a highly sensitive curse. You could have brought her with you. Brought the bottle with you. But you left her alone. Face it, Al. You don't have the smarts to raise a child. ""  
  
¬† ""You did this on purpose!"" Al raged, sounding like a little kid calling foul. Newt looked smug, and Al turned away, frustrated.  
  
¬† Shaking, I tugged the blanket higher. They were my hands. My hands. Tears prickled when I looked at the small bottle on the table, green and swirling again. I wanted to laugh. Cry. Puke. Scream. ""What's she doing here?"" I asked again, my voice stronger.  
  
¬† ""Krathion is insane,"" Al said. ""It took two of us to get him back in the bottle. ""  
  
¬† I fingered the wool blanket, worried. I had a bad feeling that Newt had tried to kill me. ""You were in my mind?"" I asked her, fearful now.  
  
¬† Newt made a small sound of regret, stepping silently across the room. ""No,"" she said petulantly as she stopped beside Pierce, slumped beside the empty tapestry. Even the moving figures made of weft and weave were afraid of her and had hidden. Pierce was nursing a swollen lip, and was sullen, even scared maybe. I was surprised to see him here at all.  
  
¬† ""Al took teacher's prerogative,"" she said as she ran her fingers through his hair. Pierce stiffened, the tightening of his lips giving away his anger. ""I merely put the soul back in the bottle once Al got it out of you. Gaily, if you can't demonstrate the ability to keep her alive, then I will take over her care and get you a dog instead. ""  
  
¬† My eyes widened. Fear got me to my feet, and I wobbled until I reached for the table for balance. ""It was my fault, not Al's. I'm fine. Really. See? All better. ""  
  
¬† Al stiffened. ""I didn't leave her alone. I left her in the care of my trusted familiar. The curse was invoked by accident. One you probably planned. ""  
  
¬† Trusted familiar? I looked at Pierce, knowing laughter would sound hysterical.  
  
¬† ""Excuses, excuses,"" Newt drawled, clearly seeing through it. ""He tried to save her life. I see it in his thoughts. "" She shifted a stray hair from Pierce to set it straight. ""It was his skill that failed him, not his spirit. He was here. You were not. "" Smiling, she turned to Al. ""Think on that before you kill him. ""  
  
¬† ""Kill him?"" Al blurted out. ""Why would I kill him?""  
  
¬† Yeah, seeing as he was Al's trusted familiar, but when Newt looked at the to-go cups spilled on the black floor, Al stiffened. His gaze flicked to Pierce, then me, and there it stayed, scaring me. Al thought I had freed him. The coffee had come from somewhere, and I couldn't line jump.  
  
¬† ""No more warnings, Al,"" Newt said, and both Al and I jerked our attention back to her. ""Your mistakes are starting to have an impact on all of us. Another error, and I take her. ""  
  
¬† ""You planned this. You gave me a bad soul. That curse couldn't contain Krathion, even if she had done it properly. "" Al seethed, but not a whisper of power edged his hands, telling me he knew better than to threaten Newt openly.  
  
¬† My skin prickled as the tension rose. Newt was crazy, but Al would lose. I didn't want to belong to her. Al and I had an agreement, but Newt would see only master and slave. ""I'm fine. Really!"" I insisted, swaying on my feet and feeling my elbow throb. I'd hit something. Hard. Al, maybe? I didn't remember it.  
  
¬† Lips curled up almost in a smile, Newt sniffed as if she smelled something rank. ""I don't understand this loyalty. He's wasting your time, Rachel. You'll have precious little of it if you're not careful. You could be so much more, so much faster. Best hurry, before I remember something else and decide you're a threat. ""  
  
¬† With hardly a breath of air shifting the candle flames, she was gone. Al let out a huge sigh and turned to me. ""You stupid bitch. ""  
  
¬† He moved, and I darted back, slipping on the black floor and going down. His hand swung where I had been, and I skittered back until I hit the hearth.  
  
¬† ""You freed him! For a cup of coffee!"" Al raged.  
  
¬† ""I didn't!"" I protested, tensing for the coming smack as he stood over me. Fight back? Yeah, there's a good idea. I'd take my licks. Then I'd take them out on Pierce later.  
  
¬† ""Algaliarept!"" Pierce shouted, and Al hesitated, the sound of his summoning name being enough to give him pause. But it was the pure ting of metal hitting the marble floor that made me jump, not the back of Al's hand, and I watched the band of charmed silver roll toward us, spinning in ever smaller circles at Al's feet.  
  
¬† ""I don't need her to slip your leash, dem  
on spawn,"" Pierce said darkly, and something in his voice twisted in me. It was threatening, decisive, and utterly unafraid. I went cold at the sight of Pierce, his feet spread wide, a flicker of black vanishing from his spread fingers as he made them into fists. His eyes promised violence.  
  
¬† ""I've been free since the moment you caught me,"" he boasted, making it into a threat. ""I'm here to keep her alive among the putrid stink of you all, not wash your dishes and twist your curses. A needed post, if you're passing off soul-stealing curses as an aura supplement. ""  
  
¬† God help me, I think I'm going to be sick. ""I don't need a babysitter,"" I said.  
  
¬† Pierce looked at me, deadly serious. ""I swan you do, Rachel,"" he said, and my eyes narrowed.  
  
¬† Al harrumphed. His hand, once poised to smack me, had turned and was now offered to help me up instead. ""How long have you known he could slip his charmed silver?"" he asked.  
  
¬† ""Not until he just did it,"" I said truthfully as he yanked me up. He let me go, and I flicked my eyes to Pierce. ""You need to stop underestimating him, Al,"" I said, not wanting to be caught between them again. ""You're right. He's going to get me killed. "" My gaze went from Al to Pierce. ""Through his own arrogance. ""  
  
¬† Pierce's eyebrows rose as he felt the sting of that, but I wouldn't drop his gaze, still angry. Al, though, couldn't have been happier. ""Indeed,"" he almost growled, clearly hearing more in my words than what I had said. ""I think we've made enough progress for today, Rachel. Go home. Get some rest. ""  
  
¬† My lips parted, and my fingers fell from the blanket over my shoulders. I could not seem to stop shivering. ""Now? I just got here. Uh, not that I'm complaining. ""  
  
¬† Al glanced at Pierce, looking as if he was mentally cracking his knuckles. Pierce was glaring right back, grim faced and determined. Idiot. As soon as I left, they were going to have a ""demon to familiar chat. "" / wasn't going to be the one to clean up after it, though.  
  
¬† ""Come along,"" Al said, taking my elbow and letting go when I hissed in pain.  
  
¬† ""You're coming with me?"" I questioned, and Al took my other, undamaged arm instead.  
  
¬† ""If you're not here when I get back,"" the demon said to Pierce, ""I will kill you. I may not be able to restrain you, but I can find you easily enough.  
  
¬† Yes?""  
  
¬† Pierce nodded, grim new lines showing on his face.  
  
¬† I opened my mouth to protest, but Al had reached out and tapped a line. In an instant, I dissolved to a thought and was pulled into the nearest ley line, ribbons of energy that strung like threads between reality and the ever-after. Instinctively I flung up a protective circle around my thoughts, but Al had beaten me to it.  
  
¬† Al? I questioned, surprised that he was with me since it more than doubled the cost.  
  
¬† I told you to do nothing. I come back and find you possessed? I had to ask Newt for help. Do you know how embarrassing that is? How long it will take me to pay that off?  
  
¬† Our minds were sharing space, and though I couldn't hear anything he didn't wanted me to, he couldn't hide his anger with me and his unexpected worry about Pierce. Al was getting a dose of my anger at the man, too. Maybe that was why Al was taking me home when he could just as easily have dumped me off in the church's graveyard. He wanted a peek at my emotions.  
  
¬† The memory of my lungs was aching, but I felt him twist something sideways, and I stumbled as we popped back into existence, the fog that had been here when I left even thicker now. The glow from the back porch was a hazy blob of yellow, and I pulled the damp, foggy spring night deep into me. Four hours, and I was home.  
  
¬† ""Student?"" Al questioned, somewhat softer now that he'd seen my anger at Pierce, and I turned to him, thinking he looked like he belonged in the fog, wearing his elegant coat, tidy boots, and smoked glasses. ""Do you have any idea the pressure I'm under?"" he added. ""The accusations you never hear about, the threats? Why do you think I double-checked that bottle Newt gave me? She wants you, Rachel, and you are giving her excuses to take you in any form she can!""  
  
¬† ""I lit the candle because I was not going to sit in the dark when your familiar left and the lights went out!"" I said, not about to take this meekly. ""I didn't mean to drop it. The paper caught fire, and I dumped the water on it to put it out. The soul was freed. The soul, Al, you bastard. You knew I wouldn't do it if it was a soul.

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! üåü I‚Äôve been diving deep into the world of mental reframing lately, and I can't help but wonder: what‚Äôs one technique that actually *works* for you? 

So here‚Äôs a little gem that‚Äôs completely changed my perspective on challenges. It‚Äôs super simple, but trust me, it packs a punch! 

**The ‚ÄúAre You Serious?‚Äù Technique** 

You ever find yourself getting totally stressed out about something that, in hindsight, seems so trivial? Like, maybe you spilled coffee on your shirt *right before* a big meeting (classic, right? üòÇ). Instead of spiraling into self-doubt or embarrassment, I started asking myself, ‚ÄúIs this truly a catastrophic event?‚Äù Spoiler alert: it rarely is.

Here‚Äôs how it goes:

1. **Identify the Situation**: What‚Äôs got you all riled up? 
   - Missed your workout? 
   - Got stuck in traffic? 
   - Ran out of coffee (the horror!)?

2. **Apply the ‚ÄúAre You Serious?‚Äù Lens**: 
   - Is this going to matter in a week? A month? A year? 
   - Will I even remember this moment five years from now? 

3. **Shift Your Focus**: 
   - Instead of feeling defeated, think about what you can learn. 
   - How can you turn this little blunder into a funny story? 

4. **Seek the Silver Lining**: 
   - Maybe the workout wasn‚Äôt just about fitness; it was about giving yourself grace! 
   - Traffic? Perfect excuse for that podcast you‚Äôve been dying to listen to!

This reframing game isn‚Äôt just about minimizing problems; it‚Äôs about **maximizing opportunities**. üôå 

Every time I catch myself in that stress loop, I whip out this technique, and honestly, it‚Äôs made my mental space so much lighter. And who doesn‚Äôt want to carry less baggage, am I right?

So, what about you? Got any quirky mental tricks that help you flip the script when life throws curveballs? üé§ *Your turn!*",1,1755283631.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I'm not opposed to looking at a screen or cracking a book, I just don't have the time. Most of my language learning free time comes while doing chores, walking the dog, working out, getting ready before or after bed, etc. 

Honestly, what I really need is a ""CofeeBreak Hungarian"" podcast. I spent a couple years listening to CoffeeBreak Spanish and I'm still struck by how much I remember just from listening (and relistening many times!) to that podcast. I guess HungarianPod101 is probably the closest to that, but I wasn't loving their format as much. A lot of other audio resources like Hungarize or Learn with Sziszi seem to assume a level of proficiency I don't have yet.

**Claytor Lake State Park, Dublin**

**Admission: Free**  
Claytor Lake State Park hosts the American Jet Sport Association (AJSA) 3rd Annual Blue Ridge Mountain Summer Series Jet Ski Regional Championship. Watch some of the best jet ski racers in the world compete for the regional championship in multiple classes including Ski, Sport, Runabout, Vintage, GP and Juniors and in several categories including sprint (Saturday), slalom (Sunday) and closed course (Saturday) racing along with a freestyle exhibition each day. Enjoy an action packed weekend of racing across three disciplines that will test the competitors' skills. A Sprint Race is a type of jet ski race focused on speed and agility, typically involving short, fast courses marked by buoys, according to Yahoo Sports. These races emphasize quick acceleration and maneuverability, showcasing the rider's ability to navigate tight turns and straightaways efficiently. Closed Course racing is currently the most popular competition in the Personal Watercraft racing community. Closed Course allows competitors to line up on a single starting line and then compete on a tight course made up of multiple buoys. Competitors will navigate a closed course composed of right and left-hand turns. In slalom racing competitors navigate a multi-buoy zig-zag course of left and right-hand turns. The final position is based on the fastest track time. Typically, a ten-second penalty is given per missed buoy unless the rider navigates back and correctly completes the turn. Competitors in a freestyle event will execute a routine displaying acrobatic and aerial tricks. Each competitor will receive two minutes to perform a routine showcasing their skills for the audience and a panel of judges. Food will be available for purchase. Spectators are encouraged to bring their own chairs and/or tents to watch. Gates open at 9:00 AM and the racing starts shortly after both days of the event.  
*Note: The $7.00 per vehicle state park parking fee still applies for this event.*

David Parmley began his musical career at age 15 and by the time he turned 17, he began his full time career as a member of The Bluegrass Cardinals. That band featured his father, Don Parmley, and three Los Angeles musicians. In 1975 they made their way to the Washington DC area and began performing several nights a week for several years. David‚Äôs lead and baritone voice was the backbone to The Cardinal sound. Dozens of musicians have worked with David and Don over the years but ‚ÄúThe Sound‚Äù remained constant. The Bluegrass Cardinals recorded dozens of projects during their 25 year run. The material is considered the finest to come out of the 70s and 80s bluegrass era. David left The Bluegrass Cardinals in the 90‚Äôs to pursue a solo career. After taking some time off, David Parmley has returned to bluegrass music with a new renewed spirit.

I hope you‚Äôre having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I‚Äôm reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands ‚Äî ideally near Amsterdam, but anywhere not too far works too!

A little about me:

‚Ä¢ I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
‚Ä¢ I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit ‚Äî but also never say no to dessert.
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôd be happy to host or come to you ‚Äî whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
‚Ä¢ I love being outside, especially in the summer ‚Äî picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace‚Ä¶ simple things, really.
‚Ä¢ Traveling is a big part of my life and dreams ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm a good listener ‚Äî friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You‚Äôll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that‚Äôs what you need ü§ó
‚Ä¢ Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me ‚Äî I value both deeply.
‚Ä¢ I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I‚Äôm looking for:

Someone to share gentle, genuine connection with ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I‚Äôm also open to making new friends ‚Äî movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby‚Ä¶ whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you‚Äôd prefer to meet in a public space first, that‚Äôs absolutely fine ‚Äî your comfort always comes first.

So if you‚Äôre someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh ‚Äî I‚Äôd really love to hear from you. üíõ

Let‚Äôs make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

1mr6efj,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommates/comments/1mr6efj/grumpy_roommate/,Grumpy Roommate,"I live in a five bedroom house (really a four bedroom house, but we use the den as a room). I had four roomies to help pay bills but the two women moved out because they found husbands and I was scrambling to find new roomies to fill their places. Well, I ended up finding a girl, code name Yesenia, who seemed cool at first, she promised to be polite and clean but soon started acting like everyones mother.

She would get mad if someone left a jacket or a blanket on the couch and stomp around cussing about it under her breath. She would mop the entire house and get angry if anyone left their rooms for any reason before it dried. She also loves to make huge meals using multiple pots and pans and then complain that everyone won't help her wash the dishes.

Most recently I went in the kitchen this morning to make coffee and start getting ready for my doctors appointment. Yesenia was cooking pasta when I came in there and I said out loud that it smelled good and she was obviously in some kind of mood because she told me ""Don't get started"" for some reason. I just shrugged and went to the fridge to get the coffee creamer and I see my mushrooms dashed all over the fridge. I exclaimed out loud ""Oh my gosh, who was being so careless??"" And as I was picking up my mushrooms and putting them back in their container, she told me, ""I just said DONT, you're acting like some sort of FREAK"" and then she stomped off to her room.

Which just leads me to believe shes the one who knocked over my mushrooms and for some reason instead of just cleaning them up she left it and then got pissed that I mentioned it. All my other roomies are men and we all keep to ourselves mostly, no drama, we occasionally watch shows together or take shots or smoke in the backyard and rarely have any arguments. Yesenia's the only one that seems to always be fussing about something or having a mood. How would you guys handle this situation? I'm completely out of patience with her antics and want to tell her to start looking for a new place to live.",1,1755283116.0,roommates,0,1.0,False

I was in weekly talk therapy for 2 years and by that time got tired of hearing myself talk about the same things, I knew I needed to override my brain and go straight to my body. After hearing the typical hard but worth it reviews, I decided to take the plunge.

It‚Äôs been 8 months and my brain has literally changed. I wasn‚Äôt sold up until a month, most of the time I felt scattered and wondered why I was sacrificing my Sunday afternoons for torture. I continued whilst being honest with my therapist about how much I hated doing it but I was responding to old events in new ways and the evidence of that kept me going. 

I‚Äôm glad I stuck with it, I‚Äôve had a few major emotionally corrective experiences over the past few weeks has restored my sense of self in a major way. I feel different to the point I‚Äôm now going to work without drinking coffee or matcha, I‚Äôm not hesitant to set boundaries and I‚Äôm at peace in a way I‚Äôm still adjusting to.

I‚Äôm truly so grateful to finally feel that my pleasure and voice matter- what used to be a question is now a deep knowing.

1mr6c1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedAndTested/comments/1mr6c1b/should_you_buy_the_best_combo_coffee_maker_ninja/,Should you buy the best combo coffee maker Ninja CFP301 or not,"Testing out the Ninja CFP301 Coffee Maker has been quite an adventure, so I‚Äôm here to share my experience with this gadget. From brewing my morning cup of coffee to experimenting with specialty drinks, I‚Äôve put this machine through its paces. You know, as a coffee lover who regularly switches between different roast blends and even tea, I was immediately intrigued by its versatility. The product offers a combination of coffee brewing options that includes both grounds and pods, making it compatible with my ever-changing caffeine-related whims. 

**Performance under Pressure**

With its 13-size dual coffee maker capabilities, this machine can whip up anything from a single cup to a full 12-cup carafe. I‚Äôve used it extensively for everything‚Äîearly-morning single cups when time is short and larger servings during family brunches. The ‚ÄúClassic,‚Äù ‚ÄúRich,‚Äù ‚ÄúOver Ice,‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpecialty‚Äù brew styles deliver decent customization, and I won‚Äôt lie‚Äîbeing able to brew iced coffee on demand has been a luxury during hot afternoons. Switching seamlessly between pod brewing and grounds is effortless with the included K-Cup adapter. 

[Grab Ninja CFP301 at the best price on Amazon.](https://coolpromoproducts.com/p/b08qzsn97z/)

**Built for Busy Bees**

The speed on this is no joke. The claim of brewing pods quicker than a leading Keurig held true in my kitchen. Mornings here are like a slow-motion panic scene from a sitcom, so shaving precious minutes off my coffee-making routine means a lot. Plus, the hot water system‚Äôs two temperature settings allowed me to throw together a quick cup of instant soup for my always-hungry teenager. Features like this make it more than just a coffee machine; in some ways, it's become a utility tool in my kitchen.

**The Frother Fantasy**

The fold-away frother is where things got fun. Using it with almond milk resulted in surprisingly smooth foam for my lattes‚Äîexactly the silky texture from the coffee shop but without the $5 price tag each time. It‚Äôs also removable for easy cleaning, which is a blessing because let‚Äôs face it‚Äîcleaning kitchen gadgets can be a total buzzkill. The frother works equally well with hot and cold milk, so even iced drinks get that caf√©-quality touch.

**Favorable Aspects**

- Convenient 13 brewing sizes for every situation
- Faster-than-average pod brewing
- Fold-away frother for specialty drinks  
- Multi-position water reservoir for flexible placement in your kitchen  
- Dual coffee brewing options for those who like pods AND grounds  

**Areas for Improvement**

- The machine is on the bulkier side, needing significant countertop space.
- Noise levels during brewing are noticeable, especially when grinding.
- It requires regular cleaning to prevent clogs in the brew system.
  
**Market Rivals**

Looking at competing products, this coffee maker stands tall against other drip coffee machines I've owned. Compared to the Keurig K-Cafe, which also offers frothing capabilities, the Ninja gets an edge for its specialty brew options and larger reservoir. On the flip side, it can‚Äôt quite match the simplicity and straightforward operation of a classic Keurig model. For those who desire a more premium espresso experience, products from brands like Breville or De‚ÄôLonghi may be worth exploring. However, they lack the versatility of this machine's pod and grounds dual compatibility.

**Bang for the Buck**

Is it worth the price? In my opinion, this coffee maker delivers excellent value for someone who appreciates versatility without splurging on a high-end espresso machine. It saves time by being a multi-functional device, eliminates the need for a separate hot water dispenser, and brings caf√©-style drinks straight to your home. There‚Äôs just something satisfying about paying once for a machine that does the job of several.

1mr6bkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1mr6bkg/how_to_reduce_the_ocd_anxiety_from_experience/,How to reduce the OCD anxiety (from experience),"I‚Äôve struggled with really bad clinical OCD for almost 10 years. I‚Äôm not a doctor or therapist, but I‚Äôve spent a *lot* of time researching, experimenting, and listening to professionals. I wanted to share what‚Äôs worked for me, not as a replacement for therapy or medication (those can be life changing for some people!), but as an additional toolkit to help your brain and body be in the best shape to fight OCD

**1: Diet ‚Äì Feeding Your Brain Right**  
Your brain is a *hungry* organ. OCD is linked to imbalances in serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and other neurotransmitters, and nutrition plays a role in all of that

**Things to focus on:**  
Omega-3 fatty acids ‚Üí Found in salmon, sardines, flaxseed, chia seeds, walnuts. Omega-3s are literally building blocks for brain cells and can improve mood regulation

Stable blood sugar ‚Üí Huge blood sugar spikes and crashes can worsen anxiety and obsessive thinking. Eat balanced meals with protein + healthy fats + complex carbs. The most important thing is to NOT skip meals

Magnesium ‚Üí This mineral calms the nervous system. Sources: pumpkin seeds, almonds, spinach, avocado, dark chocolate (70%+)

Probiotics & gut health ‚Üí The gut-brain connection is real. Eat fermented foods like yogurt, sauerkraut, or take a probiotic supplement (you can find them really cheap on amazon)

Vitamin D ‚Üí Low vitamin D is linked to depression and anxiety. Get sunlight or consider supplements (again, they are really cheap on amazon)

Zinc ‚Üí Deficiency can worsen anxiety. Found in oysters, pumpkin seeds, and certain meats

**Things to avoid/limit:**

Excess caffeine ‚Üí Increases anxiety and rumination for a lot of people with OCD. If you drink coffee, keep it moderate and early in the day

Highly processed junk foods ‚Üí These can trigger inflammation in the brain, affecting mood and focus

Excess sugar ‚Üí Spikes can make intrusive thoughts harder to control

  
**2: Hydration ‚Äì The Underrated Brain Hack**

Your brain is \~75% water. Even mild dehydration can impair mood, focus, and impulse control

Aim for: about 2‚Äì3 liters per day for most adults (more if you‚Äôre active)

Electrolytes matter, especially if you sweat a lot. Natural sources like coconut water, a pinch of Himalayan salt in water, or eating mineral-rich foods is really helpful

Tip: If you keep forgetting to drink water, keep a big bottle by your desk or bed and set timers to remind you

  
**3: Sleep ‚Äì OCD‚Äôs Silent Amplifier**

Poor sleep can magnify OCD symptoms by making your brain less able to filter intrusive thoughts

Sleep optimization basics:

7‚Äì9 hours every night ‚Üí Non-negotiable for brain recovery

Same bedtime and wake-up time daily ‚Üí Helps regulate circadian rhythm, which stabilizes overall mood

Cut screens 1 hour before bed (if not more) ‚Üí Blue light delays melatonin release

Cool, quiet room ‚Üí Your body sleeps best around 65‚Äì68¬∞F (18‚Äì20¬∞C)

Darkness matters ‚Üí You want your room to be so dark your unable to see your hands

Bonus tip ‚ÜíAvoid heavy meals, alcohol, and caffeine at least 6-8 hours before you plan to sleep

**4: Physical Activity ‚Äì OCD‚Äôs Pressure Valve**

Exercise is like free medicine for OCD, it increases serotonin, dopamine, and endorphins, and decreases cortisol. Even 20‚Äì30 minutes daily can make a noticeable difference!

  
**Final Thoughts:**

You *can‚Äôt* diet and-sleep your way out of OCD completely,  it‚Äôs a neurological condition that often needs professional help. But building a body and mind that‚Äôs physically resilient makes ERP therapy, CBT, or medication work better",7,1755282939.0,OCD,4,0.9,False

1mr68mo,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeMoney/comments/1mr68mo/side_hustles_in_crypto_trading/,Side hustles in crypto trading,"Last year, during a rough patch with my job, I started looking into ways to make some extra cash online. Living in the US, I've always been cautious with crypto, but my cousin, who's into tech, shared how he was using trading bots to snag small profits on Solana tokens. He told me about Banana Gun Pro, a tool he'd been using to automate snipes on new launches. At first, I was skeptical - sounded too good for beer money - but he walked me through his setup, showing gains from quick trades that added up to a few hundred bucks a month.  
  
Inspired, I signed up at and started with their basic features. I set it up to target low-risk opportunities, like hyped meme coins, and it handled the buys and sells faster than I could manually. The first week, I made about $50 from a couple of flips, which covered my coffee runs. Over time, tweaking the settings based on community tips, I've averaged $200-300 monthly, nothing life-changing but perfect for extra income without much effort. It's exciting watching the bot work in real-time, turning market volatility into pocket money.  
  
Of course, crypto's risky, so I only use what I can afford to lose. Has anyone else tried similar bots for passive earnings? What strategies work best for consistent small wins?",2,1755282764.0,MakeMoney,1,1.0,False

1mr66o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1mr66o5/does_hario_v60_drip_station_enhance_your_coffee/,Does Hario V60 Drip Station Enhance Your Coffee Brewing Experience?,"The Hario V60 Drip Station, also known by its model number V60, is a sleek and functional accessory that I recently added to my coffee brewing ritual. As a self-proclaimed coffee nerd, I've tried countless tools and gadgets to enhance the experience, and this acrylic drip station has quickly become a favorite. Designed with simplicity and elegance, it feels like a homage to the art of coffee making. Here‚Äôs how it performed in my day-to-day use.

**Stylish and Practical Design**  
This clear drip station immediately stands out with its minimalist aesthetic. It's not just easy on the eyes but also incredibly well-constructed. The 5.9 x 5.4 x 8.4-inch dimensions fit seamlessly on my kitchen counter without hogging too much space. Paired with the V60 dripper, it creates an almost professional coffee setup. The sturdy acrylic material has a glossy finish that‚Äôs surprisingly resistant to fingerprints and minor scratches, at least during the few weeks I‚Äôve been testing it. Though the design is simple, it balances practicality and elegance‚Äîexactly what you want from specialty coffee equipment.

**Ease of Use**  
The beauty of this drip station lies in its simplicity. It‚Äôs remarkably intuitive; you place the V60 dripper on top, position your favorite mug or carafe on the tray below, and you‚Äôre good to go. There‚Äôs no assembly required, which as someone with the patience of a caffeinated squirrel, is a huge plus. While it doesn‚Äôt revolutionize the brewing process, it certainly makes it more organized and less messy. It's worth noting, however, that the tray is not dishwasher-compatible, so you'll need to hand wash it. While that's not a deal-breaker for me, it might be for someone who prioritizes low-maintenance tools.

**Key Benefits**  
- Eye-catching design that matches with other Hario products.  
- Compact and fits well in small spaces.  
- Easy to clean, ensuring consistent performance.  

[Check Hario V60 price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b00a4zgcki/)

**Build Quality and Compatibility**  
The acrylic material is durable yet lightweight, which is perfect if you ever need to move it around. Despite weighing just under a pound (15.4 ounces), it doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy. I can attest to its compatibility claims‚Äîmy V60 dripper fits perfectly, and there‚Äôs enough clearance beneath for taller mugs or small carafes. If you‚Äôve got a whole Hario setup, this piece fits naturally into the ecosystem. One thing I wished for, though, was slightly less wobble when the station is placed on uneven surfaces. A bit more stability would have been a welcome improvement.

**Limitations**  
- Not dishwasher-compatible, requiring hand washing.  
- Slight wobble on uneven surfaces.  
- The acrylic can scratch if not handled with care.  

**Everyday Performance**  
Over the weeks I‚Äôve been using it, the drip station has become a staple piece in my morning coffee ritual. Whether I‚Äôm brewing just one cup or hosting friends for a coffee tasting session, this tool makes the process smoother. No more balancing the dripper on random mugs or worrying about spills. Plus, the removable tray catches all minor drips, which makes cleanup effortless. It‚Äôs these small conveniences that make a noticeable difference, though the station itself doesn‚Äôt add any magical flavor to your brew. Let‚Äôs leave that to the beans and the barista (me!).

**Competitors**  
When weighing other options, I looked at similar drip stations and stands, such as the Fellow Stagg Pour-Over Set and the Kalita Wave Brew Stand. The Fellow Stagg offers a more industrial look and extra features but leans towards the pricier side. The Kalita Wave Stand sits in a similar price range, with slightly more metal and wood elements. Compared to these, the Hario V60 station strikes a great balance between cost and simplicity. It‚Äôs also easier to clean due to its fully acrylic makeup, whereas other designs might involve materials prone to staining, like wood or matte metal.

**Value for Money**  
I think the asking price for the Hario V60 Drip Station feels justified. It‚Äôs not the cheapest accessory out there, but when you consider the design quality and compatibility with the V60 dripper, it sits firmly in the ‚Äúyou get what you pay for‚Äù category. Fans of pour-over coffee who want a hassle-free and aesthetic brewing experience will find this station a good investment. For me, it‚Äôs worth every cent because it fits my brewing style and elevates the entire coffee-making process, both in usability and how it all looks on my countertop.

1mr62zv,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mr62zv/hr_we_were_made_of_ash/,[HR] We Were Made of Ash,"They arrived on a Thursday, hands laced, hearts warm. The forest was cold that time of year, a perpetual dusk even at noon, but they didn‚Äôt mind. Julian carried their bags. Amelia hummed softly as they approached the cabin‚Äîold, forgotten, sunken slightly into the earth like it was trying to return to the grave.

‚ÄúNo cell service,‚Äù she said with a grin.

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Julian said, kissing her knuckles. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just make memories.‚Äù

They would never leave the woods.

‚∏ª

The cabin creaked like it was breathing. Long, groaning inhalations in the rafters at night. The shadows were too still. The air too heavy.

On the first night, Julian dreamt of a figure watching them from the trees. Its limbs were too long. Its head tilted at angles no neck could hold. It didn‚Äôt walk‚Äîit drifted, barely above the forest floor, dragging behind it something that looked like skin unraveling in ribbons.

He woke with a scream lodged in his throat. Amelia kissed him until it melted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a bad dream,‚Äù she whispered.

The next morning, he forgot what the dream was about.

‚∏ª

On the second day, the coffee was bitter and cold. He swore he‚Äôd added cream. Amelia frowned and asked where he put the sugar.

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt bring any,‚Äù he said.

She opened the cabinet. There it was. White. Labeled. Still sealed.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she said, softly. ‚ÄúGuess I forgot.‚Äù

But her voice quivered.

‚∏ª

That night, Julian stared at the fireplace. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your middle name?‚Äù

Amelia looked up. Blinked.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù She tried to laugh, but it cracked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre joking, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I just realized I don‚Äôt remember it.‚Äù

She frowned. ‚ÄúYou know everything about me.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot your middle name.‚Äù

A beat.

‚ÄúDo you remember where we met?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶College?‚Äù Julian said.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt go to college.‚Äù

They stared at each other.

There was no wind, but the cabin groaned again. Something moved behind the walls‚Äîwet and slow.

‚∏ª

By the third day, they no longer slept. The creature did.

It only came when the mind began to weaken‚Äîwhen memories softened and the brain relaxed its grip on the soul. It would crawl through the cracks of memory, burrowing into the folds of the mind like rot. You never saw it directly.

But you heard it.

It was like a dying breath, wheezing in your left ear.

You felt it.

Like a hand brushing the back of your neck when you were sure you were alone.

Julian heard scratching beneath the floorboards. When he got on his knees and pressed his ear to the wood, he heard whispering.

His name.

Then hers.

And then nothing.

When he looked up, Amelia was sitting by the fire, staring at him like she didn‚Äôt know him at all.

‚∏ª

On the fourth day, they woke in separate rooms.

Julian opened a door and found Amelia in a chair, sobbing. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt hurt me.‚Äù

He dropped to his knees. ‚ÄúAmelia, please. It‚Äôs me. It‚Äôs Julian.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that name,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know my name.‚Äù

The room was cold. The shadows too thick. He reached out for her, but stopped. Her skin was going gray, like smoke.

‚ÄúI think,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm forgetting how to speak.‚Äù

Her voice sounded far away.

She stood and staggered forward, grabbing his face. Her eyes locked onto his.

‚ÄúI feel something. When I look at you.‚Äù

He held her.

She screamed. Not in pain, but in horror‚Äîas though realizing something she didn‚Äôt have words for.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something in here with us.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Julian boarded the windows. Covered the mirrors. But every reflection showed something just behind him. Sometimes, it had no face. Other times, it had his face. Or hers. Or a dozen overlapping faces, stitched together by sorrow.

It was hungry, but it did not eat flesh.

It devoured identity.

It slithered through time, dragging its bloated, memory-fed body behind it like a funeral veil. Its touch left nothing. Not just death. Absence.

They found their old photos. Blank. Their journals‚Äîsmeared. Words dripping like ink in water.

Amelia found a sketchbook she didn‚Äôt remember drawing in. Dozens of the same image.

Two people. Holding hands. But the faces were smudged. Every page more distorted. Until the last page was just a void with hands, desperate and reaching.

‚∏ª

By the fifth day, they forgot what love was.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve ever loved anyone,‚Äù Julian whispered.

Amelia nodded. Her face was paler. ‚ÄúMe neither.‚Äù

He wept, but he didn‚Äôt know why. ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt answer.

She wasn‚Äôt sure what ‚Äúwrong‚Äù meant anymore.

That night, he dreamt of her standing at the foot of the bed, limbs too long, her mouth sewn shut with memory threads. When she opened her lips, moths flew out‚Äîcarrying their laughter, their stories, their names.

The creature was inside her.

And he loved her too much to run.

‚∏ª

By the sixth day, Julian found a note in his pocket.

‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù it said. In her handwriting.

On the back, it read: ‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm gone, please remember me. Please. Please.‚Äù

He clutched it like it was oxygen.

But when he blinked, the ink faded.

When he blinked again, the paper turned to ash in his hands.

Amelia stood outside, staring at the forest.

He called to her.

She turned.

‚ÄúDo I know you?‚Äù she asked.

Julian collapsed to the ground.

‚∏ª

The seventh day was quiet.

Too quiet.

He walked from room to room, whispering names he no longer remembered, searching for the pieces of someone he once loved.

The fireplace was cold. The bed was made.

The cabin was full of nothing.

No photos. No scent. No warmth.

He looked into the mirror.

There was no reflection.

‚∏ª

At the edge of the forest, something tall watched him.

It had eyes like wounds, wide and wet and endless. Its smile stretched too far. Its skin was made of forgotten prayers and dead lullabies. It bled memory from its pores.

Julian stumbled toward it.

‚ÄúYou took her,‚Äù he whispered.

It didn‚Äôt speak.

It didn‚Äôt need to.

Behind it, he saw a sea of shadows‚Äîpeople it had taken. All of them‚Ä¶ half-people. Faces unfinished. Features smoothed away like clay washed in rain. Some clung to words they didn‚Äôt understand. Others just stared at nothing.

He thought he saw her among them.

He tried to reach.

But he no longer remembered why.

‚∏ª

Julian returned to the cabin one last time.

He sat by the fire.

He opened his mouth to speak a name.

Nothing came.

He laughed. Or cried. He wasn‚Äôt sure.

Then he said, to no one at all:
‚ÄúIf someone finds this place‚Ä¶ tell her I tried. Tell her we were happy once.‚Äù

And then he slept.

And the creature watched.

And the world forgot.

‚∏ª

No one finds the cabin anymore.
Even maps show only forest.
No one remembers the couple who walked into the woods.
Not even the forest remembers their footsteps.

Only the creature remembers.

And it always will.

Because what it devours,
it becomes.

Heard Dr. Rhonda Patrick talk about lactate recently ‚Äî apparently when you do high-intensity exercise, your muscles make lactate, and that stuff crosses into the brain, boosts BDNF (brain growth factor), and might even help dopamine levels.

I‚Äôve got ADHD (COMT fast) and started doing 20s all-out / 1:10 light x 6 rounds (~15 min total). The post-workout focus feels way cleaner and longer-lasting than coffee.

Anyone else tried using HIIT/lactate spikes for ADHD focus? How long do the effects last for you?

Every morning, she sits at the table while I have my coffee, staring at me like she‚Äôs waiting for her turn to talk about the weather. When I work from home, she curls up in the chair next to mine instead of my lap, like we‚Äôre two coworkers just sharing an office space

But the weirdest thing happened last week my friend came over, and Luna casually walked up, sat beside her on the couch, and leaned against her shoulder like she was watching TV. No cat stuff, no running away, just pure roommate energy

¬† ‚ÄúNo, thanks,‚Äù I said, cradling my phone against my shoulder as I wiped a jelly smear off the Formica counter. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really nice of you. But I‚Äôm not going anywhere.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSabrina,‚Äù Caleb said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a Category Five hurricane headed straight for you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not headed straight for me. It‚Äôs headed for Miami.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLittle Bridge Island is only a hundred and fifty miles south of Miami.‚Äù Caleb sounded exasperated. ‚ÄúThe storm could change course at any time. That‚Äôs why they call the hurricane track the cone of uncertainty.‚Äù  
  
¬† He wasn‚Äôt telling me anything I didn‚Äôt already know. But it was typical of Caleb to feel it necessary to explain the weather to me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks for your concern,‚Äù I said coolly. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôll take my chances.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTake your chances of dying? Do you really hate me that much?‚Äù  
  
¬† This was a good question. Caleb Foley had had his good points: like me, he loved a good painting. His family owned one of the largest private collections of nineteenth-century Impressionist works in North America.  
  
¬† He‚Äôd also been great in bed, always waiting politely to orgasm until after I did.  
  
¬† But when I‚Äôd needed him most‚Äîwhich was definitely not now‚Äîwhat had he done?  
  
¬† Ghosted.  
  
¬† And now he thought he could make it up to me with a free ride in his Gulfstream just because a hurricane might sideswipe the little island to which I‚Äôd fled in order to recover from my heartbreak?  
  
¬† Sorry. Too little, too late.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice of you to offer.‚Äù I ignored his question. ‚ÄúBut like I said, I‚Äôm not going anywhere.‚Äù  
  
¬† I thought of telling him the real reason why‚ÄîGary, with whom my life had become inextricably tied, but who was in no shape to travel at the moment.  
  
¬† But what would be the point? I knew what Caleb would say about Gary. He wouldn‚Äôt understand.  
  
¬† It felt a little weird keeping something that meant so much to me from this person with whom I‚Äôd once shared every little thing in my life.  
  
¬† But it also felt right.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBesides,‚Äù I added, instead, ‚Äúno one here is evacuating.‚Äù  
  
¬† It was true. Instead of panicking and running around, throwing all of their stuff into the backs of their cars the way I always imagined people would when a hurricane was in the vicinity, the residents of Little Bridge Island, population 4,700, seemed to be taking the news in stride. The caf√© where I worked was packed with the usual breakfast crowd, and though a lot of people were talking about the storm, no one seemed alarmed, only vaguely irritated. . . .  
  
¬† Like Drew Hartwell, whom I could hear next to me informing someone over the phone that he wouldn‚Äôt be replacing the hundred-year-old window sash they‚Äôd hired him to restore anytime soon.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBecause there‚Äôs a storm on the way,‚Äù Drew said, sounding a little testy as he dabbed more hot sauce onto his Spanish omelet, ‚Äúand there‚Äôs no way the glazing‚Äôs going to dry before it gets here. That‚Äôs why. If you want an inch of rainwater all over your bathroom floor, that‚Äôs your business, but personally, I‚Äôd wait until it passes.‚Äù  
  
¬† Normally I don‚Äôt make a habit of eavesdropping on my customers‚Äô conversations, but then normally Drew Hartwell didn‚Äôt use his cell phone in the caf√©. He was good about following the rules that Ed, the Mermaid‚Äôs manager slash owner, had listed by the cash register:  
  
¬† NO SHOES, NO SHIRT, NO PROBLEM.  
  
¬† USE YOUR CELL PHONE? GET OUT.  
  
¬† One person who isn‚Äôt so good at following the rules? Me. The last one, anyway.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBeckham!‚Äù Ed bellowed at me from behind the counter. I whipped around and saw him glaring at me. He jerked a thumb at my cell phone, then the glass side door. ‚ÄúTake it outside if it‚Äôs that important.‚Äù His irritated gaze fell on Drew, who happened to be his nephew, but whom he still treated like any other customer. ‚ÄúYou, too.‚Äù  
  
¬† Drew held up a calloused palm, nodding as he slid off his orange vinyl counter stool and headed toward the door, his phone still clutched to his chin. ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù he said to whoever was on the other end of his call. ‚ÄúI get it. But you‚Äôre going to have the window boarded up anyway. So it‚Äôs not going to make any‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† The rest of his conversation was lost as he stepped outside.  
  
¬† Sorry, I mouthed to Ed. Then, to Caleb, I said quickly, ‚ÄúListen, I‚Äôm at work. I never should have picked up in the first place. I only did because . . . because . . .‚Äù  
  
¬† Why had I picked up, especially since Caleb and I hadn‚Äôt spoken in months? Maybe because it was eight o‚Äôclock in the morning, and he never called this early. I‚Äôd assumed it was an emergency, only not an emergency concerning him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs all you wanted, I‚Äôll talk to you later, okay?‚Äù As in, never.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, Sabrina. I‚Äôve got to talk to you now. The thing is, your mother‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† I knew it. My pulse quickened. ‚ÄúWhat about her? Is there something wrong?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fine. But she‚Äôs the one who‚Äôs been bugging me to phone, since you won‚Äôt pick up when she calls.‚Äù  
  
¬† My heartbeat slowed. Of course. I should have known. Caleb would never have called, let alone volunteered to fly fifteen hundred miles to get me of his own accord . . . not after the way we‚Äôd ended things. Or not we, exactly, considering the fact that I was the one who‚Äôd packed up my things, handed my keys to his doorman, and left, making me, technically, the one who had ghosted.  
  
¬† But not really. What else could I have done? What kind of relationship had the two of us even had? Not one I‚Äôd wanted anything to do with anymore.  
  
¬† Now I was heading for the door again‚Äîthe Mermaid‚Äôs side door. A rush of humid, saltwater-scented air greeted me as I stepped out onto the sidewalk, ignoring the glare from Ed as well as the curious looks my fellow servers, Angela and Nevaeh, threw me. Neither of them could imagine what was  
so important that I‚Äôd dare take a call during the morning rush. I hardly ever got calls anyway, so this was a first.  
  
¬† A first that was probably going to get me fired.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCaleb, look‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs really worried about you, Sabrina. We all are.‚Äù  
  
¬† It was all I could do to keep from bursting out laughing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou know your mom pals around with all those meteorologists from the station,‚Äù Caleb went on. ‚ÄúShe says they tell her this one is a real monster. If there were such a thing as a Category Six, this would be it. She says‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTell my mom I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I interrupted, aware that Drew Hartwell was standing only a few feet away from me, his own cell clutched to his ear, having a not dissimilar conversation. I could hear him telling whoever was on the other end of the phone, ‚ÄúWell, for one thing, because I have other things to do right now than restore a century-old window you waited until the last minute to notice needed repairing. And for another, because I‚Äôm going to have to special-order the replacement glass, and there‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs going to get here before the rain does.‚Äù  
  
¬† Except that Drew Hartwell didn‚Äôt look particularly worried. He never did. Even now his free hand‚Äîthe one not holding his phone‚Äîhad crept beneath his well-worn, sun-faded Little Bridge Island Bocce League T-shirt to scratch lazily at his flat stomach, unconsciously revealing a trail of dark, downy hair that disappeared into the waistband of his cargo shorts . . . the sight of which caused my stomach to give a pleasant lurch, as if I‚Äôd just taken a spin on a Tilt-A-Whirl.  
  
¬† What was wrong with me?  
  
¬† Realizing I was staring, I glanced hastily away, remembering the whispered warning my coworker Angela Fairweather had given me on my first day of work: ‚ÄúStay away from that one. There was a time when that old pickup of his was parked in front of a different house every week. For a while, it was a different house a night.‚Äù  
  
¬† Because apparently Drew Hartwell‚Äîwith his lean six-foot frame, tousled dark hair, permanent deep-sea tan, and summer-sky blue eyes‚Äîwas as much of a player as Caleb and his friends, just of a different variety: Drew was the homegrown style.  
  
¬† Having been born on Little Bridge Island, Drew had never lived anywhere else, with the exception of a few years on the mainland.  
  
¬† Whereas Caleb and his best friend, Kyle‚Äîwho‚Äôd turned my entire life upside down in a single moment‚Äîhad been born in New York City and had traveled all over the world, thanks to their trust funds and wealthy parents.  
  
¬† And yet Caleb still didn‚Äôt know a thing about women. Or at least the one he was currently speaking to.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can tell your mom that you‚Äôre fine all you want, Sabrina,‚Äù Caleb was saying into my ear. ‚ÄúBut she isn‚Äôt going to stop calling. She said to tell you that she thinks it‚Äôs time you stopped being so stubborn and gave up on this little solo adventure to find yourself, or whatever it is, and come home. And that it shouldn‚Äôt take a Category Five hurricane for you to realize it.‚Äù  
  
¬† I smiled wryly. It sounded exactly like something my mom would say. ‚ÄúWell, do me a favor and let her know that I haven‚Äôt quite finished finding myself, but when I do, she‚Äôll be the first to know. In the meantime, I‚Äôm perfectly capable of taking care of myself. I don‚Äôt need help from her, or anybody else‚Äîespecially you.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs just great, Sabrina.‚Äù Now Caleb sounded offended. ‚ÄúExcuse me for caring. You know, last time I talked to you, you were mad at me for not caring enough‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† I felt a different kind of spurt from my gut, far less pleasant than the one I‚Äôd experienced at the sight of Drew‚Äôs naked stomach. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I said, and you know it. There‚Äôs a difference between not caring and calling me a liar.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI never called you a liar, Sabrina. I just said that maybe you were overreacting‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOverreacting? Really, Caleb?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, overreacting. You know Kyle gets a little frisky when he‚Äôs had too much to drink‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† A little frisky? I was so mad, I had to force myself to gaze past the harbor, out where the turquoise blue sky met the aquamarine sea, in order to steady myself. Something about the sight of that calm, azure water stretching as far as the eye could see always seemed to help me find my equilibrium. I‚Äôd taken to painting it during my time off from work‚Äînot, however, when anyone else was around‚Äîand it always soothed me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get into it again, Caleb,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI need to go back to my job, or I‚Äôll lose it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, wouldn‚Äôt that be a tragedy,‚Äù Caleb sneered. ‚ÄúYour waitressing job at some beach bar in Florida.‚Äù  
  
¬† I glanced hastily in Drew Hartwell‚Äôs direction, fearful that he might have overheard‚ÄîCaleb could be as overbearingly loud on the phone as he was in person.  
  
¬† But fortunately, Drew still seemed preoccupied with his own call.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAt least,‚Äù I hissed at Caleb through gritted teeth, ‚ÄúI have a job.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, was that supposed to be a blow to my ego, Sabrina?‚Äù Caleb said snarkily. ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôve never had a job, I‚Äôm somehow inferior to you? Excuse me for not rising to the bait. Look, if you won‚Äôt come with me, at least let me send you a ticket for a commercial flight, since you can‚Äôt seem to be bothered to buy one on your own.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even try it,‚Äù I snarled into the phone, ‚Äúbecause I‚Äôm not leaving Little Bridge Island. And it‚Äôs Bree now, not Sabrina.‚Äù  
  
¬† Then I hung up on him.  
  
¬† Chapter Two  
  
¬† A hurricane is a rotating storm system that begins over the ocean and can span hundreds of miles across, at the center of which is a region of low pressure called an eye, from which rain bands spiral outward.  
  
¬† It wasn‚Äôt until I was jamming my phone back into the pocket of my jeans that I realized how quiet it had gotten all of a sudden. I couldn‚Äôt hear anything except that Drew Hartwell‚Äôs conversation had ceased . . . and that his gaze was no longer on the harbor in front of us, but on me.  
  
¬† It was difficult to tell given the slant of the sun‚Äîit was shining full on into his face, and I‚Äôd left my sunglasses inside‚Äîbut he appeared to be smiling, that sardonic smile for which Drew Hartwell was well known, and about which Angela had also warned me. I couldn‚Äôt tell how much of my conversation he‚Äôd overheard.  
  
¬† Oh God, I thought, my heart thumping. Don‚Äôt let it have been too much.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFirst hurricane?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† I bristled. ‚ÄúWhat? No.‚Äù  
  
¬† The last thing you wanted was for one of these native islanders to accuse you of being ‚ÄúFresh Water‚Äù‚Äînew to the place. They took great joy in informing tourists that ‚Äúconch‚Äù‚Äîa shellfish and local delicacy, served fried at the Mermaid in sandwiches, on salads, and on their own, hush-puppy style‚Äîwas pronounced ‚Äúkonk‚Äù and not ‚Äúkonch,‚Äù and that there were man-eating sharks along the reef, where tourists loved to snorkel (though the truth was that the sharks ate only other fish and were extremely shy, and there‚Äôd been only one reported shark attack in the past fifty years, and that had been when a tourist, showing off, had attacked the shark first).  
  
¬† Getting a sunburn or mosquito bite was a sure sign that you were ‚ÄúFresh Water.‚Äù All native-born Little Bridge Islanders woke up and applied SPF 100 and several layers of mosquito repellant first thing after showering. This was how they managed to avoid both melanoma and the various mosquito-borne illnesses that had been running rampant in South Florida for centuries. Whenever a beet-red, mosquito-stung tourist limped into the caf√©, even my self-absorbed teenage coworker Nevaeh would shake her head and murmur, ‚ÄúOh, poor thing.‚Äù  
  
¬† Which was why I lied to Drew Hartwell.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI went through Wilhelmina when I, uh, first moved here.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, Wilhelmina,‚Äù he said, and nodded at the memory of the fierce Category 3 storm that a decade earlier had done so much damage.  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt mention that at the time I‚Äôd been sixteen and living in my parents‚Äô vacation rental, and that at the first hint of wind my mother had insisted on evacuating us to an exclusive resort and spa outside of Miami, where we‚Äôd ridden through the outer rain bands of the sto  
rm in a three-bedroom suite with full power, room service, and our own butler.  
  
¬† Technically, I‚Äôd still gone through Hurricane Wilhelmina . . . just not the way Drew Hartwell thought I had.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo. You going to evacuate?‚Äù he asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt planning on it,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThough people in my family seem to think I should.‚Äù I gestured toward my pocket to indicate my phone.  
  
¬† He nodded again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFamily,‚Äù he muttered, squinting at the horizon. He said it as if it were a dirty word.  
  
¬† It wasn‚Äôt a total mystery to me why. Angela‚Äôs warning about Drew Hartwell had been echoed by Nevaeh as well, just not for the same reasons. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs crazy,‚Äù Nevaeh had said.  
  
¬† And Nevaeh (Heaven spelled backward) would know, since Drew Hartwell was her uncle. It had been weeks before I‚Äôd learned that the only reason Nevaeh considered her uncle crazy was not because he‚Äôd done anything particularly outlandish, but because he‚Äôd once had a thriving carpentry career up north, which had included a partnership in a fledgling historic restoration company in ‚ÄúNoDo‚Äù (Nevaeh‚Äôs grasp of Manhattan real estate was slim).  
  
¬† And yet he‚Äôd given it all up in order to move back to the island.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWho would do something so nuts?‚Äù Nevaeh had asked me one morning as we were wrapping forks, knives, and spoons into paper napkins. ‚ÄúWho would leave an amazing life in New York City to come back here?‚Äù  
  
¬† I‚Äôd known what she was doing‚Äîfishing around for my reason for having done exactly that‚Äîbut I didn‚Äôt fall for it. Nevaeh was one of the biggest gossips in the caf√©, which was forgivable, since she was fifteen and only working in the diner for the summer because its owners, Lucy and Ed Hartwell, were her great-aunt and uncle. For reasons that had never been fully explained to me, Nevaeh was living with her aunt and uncle instead of her parents, Drew Hartwell‚Äôs sister and a man who was, according to Nevaeh, a famous baseball player who was someday going to come back and take her away from ‚Äúall of this.‚Äù  
  
¬† I‚Äôd said only, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sure your uncle Drew had his reasons for leaving the city,‚Äù and left it at that.  
  
¬† But I‚Äôd been unable to keep from wondering myself, especially since the woman with whom Drew had moved back to Little Bridge from New York had apparently had trouble with the adjustment. Nevaeh had kept a sharp eye on her, envying while at the same time scorning her ‚Äúbig city‚Äù ways (‚ÄúI heard she buys this special pink salt that comes all the way from Europe and costs twenty dollars a bottle. Who needs twenty-dollar European pink salt?‚Äù Nevaeh had shaken her head in wonder. ‚ÄúWhat makes it so much better than plain old white American salt?

¬†Drew was building his own house on beachside property left to him by his parents (who‚Äôd died under circumstances nearly as mysterious as Nevaeh‚Äôs living arrangements . . . or at least, mysterious to me).  
  
¬† It wasn‚Äôt long before rumors began to circulate that all was not well between him and Leighanne (the big-city girlfriend) out there on Sandy Point Beach.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI heard she can‚Äôt take the heat,‚Äù Nevaeh informed me one morning as we were refilling ketchup bottles. ‚ÄúI mean, literally. Uncle Drew hasn‚Äôt got the air-conditioning system installed yet. He says he might not install one at all. He doesn‚Äôt like air-conditioning.‚Äù  
  
¬† I was appalled. ‚ÄúIt was eighty-five degrees last night. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep without AC.‚Äù  
  
¬† Nevaeh nodded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more than just that, though. I hear she‚Äôs got island fever.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIsland fever?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like claustrophobia. It happens to people who can‚Äôt stand living so far from the mainland. They have to get out. Just watch. Leighanne‚Äôs gonna dump him and move back to New York. I already warned him, but does he listen to me? Nope.‚Äù  
  
¬† A few weeks later, that‚Äôs exactly what Leighanne did do‚Äîin a dramatic fashion we all got to witness, since she chose to do it at the caf√©, storming in during the height of the breakfast rush and hurling a small object at Drew‚Äôs chest as he sat at his usual place at the counter, sipping his coffee and reading the sports page of the local paper.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù Leighanne had shouted. ‚ÄúYou can have your damn keys back. I won‚Äôt be needing them anymore.‚Äù  
  
¬† Drew had looked confused . . . even more so when the next thing she‚Äôd hurled at him was, of all things, a saltshaker. I knew this because I‚Äôd been standing beside him holding two orders of huevos rancheros when the object struck him in the chest, then landed at my feet, miraculously unbroken. The shaker was empty, except for a slight tinge of pink at the bottom.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd you can have that back, too,‚Äù Leighanne had shouted. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anything of yours. And you‚Äôll never have to worry about putting up with anything of mine again.‚Äù  
  
¬† Then she‚Äôd turned and stormed from the restaurant, the glossy brown curls beneath her straw cowboy hat bobbing, while Drew only sat there, looking mildly astonished. At least until Nevaeh, now worried that she was losing her glamorous potential aunt-to-be forever, had cried, ‚ÄúWell, don‚Äôt just sit there, Uncle Drew. Go after her!‚Äù  
  
¬† But Drew had chosen not to‚Äîwhich had probably been for the best, since even if he‚Äôd tried, it would have been too late, given the possible case of island fever. As Leighanne sped off, all of us could see that the back of her Mini Cooper was piled high with her belongings, most likely not only including the infamous salt, but also the heart that she‚Äôd reclaimed from him.  
  
¬† So I could understand why ‚ÄúUncle Drew‚Äù might feel a little down on family at the moment, especially since Nevaeh had spent the better part of the following week bitterly informing anyone who would listen, ‚ÄúI told him she was going to dump him if he wasn‚Äôt more careful. I told him!‚Äù  
  
¬† That didn‚Äôt give Drew the right, however, to swing his unnervingly blue gaze on me and say what he did next, which was, ‚ÄúAlthough in your case, your family is right. You should evacuate, Fresh Water.‚Äù  
  
¬† I was so stunned, I couldn‚Äôt even summon up a suitably stinging retort before he turned and headed coolly back indoors to his breakfast.  
  
¬† Where did he get off, I wondered as I stood there, open-mouthed in the early morning heat, suggesting I couldn‚Äôt handle myself in a hurricane? He barely even knew me. After three months of serving breakfast to him nearly every day‚ÄîSpanish omelet, caf√© con leche, no sugar‚Äîthis was the longest conversation we‚Äôd ever had.  
  
¬† True, he‚Äôd always been a generous tipper‚Äî30 percent, and cash, even when he‚Äôd paid for the meal by credit card.  
  
¬† But still.  
  
¬† Maybe, I told myself as I grasped the handle to the caf√©‚Äôs side door, it wasn‚Äôt that Drew thought I couldn‚Äôt handle a hurricane, but that I‚Äôd been there to witness his humiliating breakup. Some men could be sensitive about things like that.  
  
¬† Although I had to admit, he‚Äôd never seemed too upset about it. I‚Äôd seen at least half a dozen attractive young women walk up to him in the caf√© since and inform him that they had plenty of ‚Äúsalt‚Äù for his ‚Äúshaker‚Äù anytime he needed some . . . not that he appeared to have taken any of them up on it, so far as I could tell.  
  
¬† It was tough to keep a secret in a place as small as Little Bridge. Though I‚Äôd managed to keep mine.  
  
¬† Back inside, the air felt pleasantly cool and scented with the smell of freshly cooked bacon, as it did every morning.  
  
¬† Something was wrong, however. I sensed it as soon as I walked in. The usual early morning sounds to which I‚Äôd grown so accustomed‚Äîthe scrape of forks against plates, and the low murmur of conversation as folks discussed the headlines in the local paper‚Äîwere gone.  
  
¬† For a second, I was worried I really had been fired‚ÄîEd was as well known for his fiery temper as he was for his ability to bake a truly outstanding key lime pie‚Äîbut a glance at Angela‚Äôs and Nevaeh‚Äôs faces showed me this wasn‚Äôt the case. Instead of looking at me, everyone‚Äôs attention was glued to both of the television sets that hung from the ceiling, one at each end of the breakfast counter. Ed kept one tuned to Fox News, and the other to CNN, both with the sound off and closed captioning on. This seemed to keep all customers happy.  
  
¬† But today, out of deference to the storm, both televisions were tuned to the Weather Channel, with the sound up.  
  
¬† That‚Äôs how I was able to hear the meteorologists announce that Hurricane Marilyn was making a turn, and now appeared to be heading straight for Little Bridge Island.  
  
¬† Chapter Three  
  
¬† The high winds of a hurricane sweeping across the ocean can produce a dangerous storm surge, a wall of water that can cause massive flooding even hundreds of miles inland.  
  
¬† Some people like to say that Little Bridge Island was discovered by the Spanish in 1513, but of course that isn‚Äôt true. You can‚Äôt ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù something that‚Äôs already been occupied for thousands of years before you ever even got there. Little Bridge, a small island in a chain of similar islands off the coast of the tip of Florida known as the Florida Keys, was home to the Tequesta Indians for many centuries before the Spanish invaded it. The Indians were enslaved, and eventually the Keys were turned into U.S. territory.  
  
¬† Little Bridge got its name due to the fact that it‚Äôs connected to the rest of the Keys by a bridge.  
  
¬† But since most of the Keys are connected to one another by bridges, it makes no sense that Little Bridge is named after the fact that it has a bridge.  
  
¬† But that‚Äôs part of its quirky appeal, and probably what drew my father to it when he was a young man and began planning our family vacations. He liked quirky places, and Little Bridge, with its odd name and even odder residents, is one of the quirkiest.  
  
¬† So Little Bridge was where we vacationed every year, even though my mother was pretty vocal about the fact that she‚Äôd have preferred to go somewhere more cosmopolitan, such as the Hamptons, Paris, or Ibiza.  
  
¬† But like my father, I grew to love our vacation house on the canal, waking to the smell of the salt water, finding manatees drinking from the hose of our dock, watching egrets pluck their delicate way through the sand. I loved boating, the rush of wind through my hair, the glassy stillness of the water near the sandbars, the challenge of painting that water, making it look as mirrorlike and gleaming on my canvas as it did in real life.  
  
¬† And of course walking through the quaint, sun-drenched town, the historic buildings‚Äîby law none were allowed to be more than two stories tall, because anything higher might impede a neighbor‚Äôs view of the sunset‚Äîeach painted a different shade of pink or blue or yellow, stopping for ice cream or groceries at the locally owned shops. I could see why my father loved Little Bridge, why he would have moved there if his job as a successful defense attorney in Manhattan‚Äîand my mother‚Äôs dislike of the town‚Äîhadn‚Äôt made such a dream impossible.  
  
¬† I loved it, too.  
I felt safe in Little Bridge‚Äînot that, back then, I had any reason to feel unsafe anywhere.  
  
¬† It made perfect sense to me that it was to Little Bridge that I fled when my safety felt threatened. My father‚Äîif he hadn‚Äôt passed away last year‚Äîwould have understood.  
  
¬† But now the new comfortable, safe life I‚Äôd put so carefully together seemed to be crumbling. I knew it the minute I walked into my apartment after I got off work and found my roommate, Daniella, throwing clothes into a suitcase.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù I asked, though I had a sinking feeling I already knew. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not evacuating, are you?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSure am.‚Äù She took a slurp from the frozen margarita she‚Äôd poured herself. I‚Äôd seen the pitcher from the blender sitting on the kitchen counter as I‚Äôd walked into the two-bedroom apartment we shared.  
  
¬† The place was tiny‚Äîeach of the bedrooms hardly large enough to fit a queen-size bed‚Äîbut I considered myself lucky to have found it . . . not the place so much as the person who‚Äôd come with it.  
  
¬† A curvaceous, good-humored ER nurse, Daniella was outgoing and bubbly‚Äîexactly the kind of person I needed to be around after what I‚Äôd gone through this past year back in New York, just like the job at the Mermaid was exactly the kind of job I needed now. I was up and out the door by five thirty every morning, even on my days off, since Gary was used to being fed that early and woke me like clockwork daily at dawn.  
  
¬† This worked out well since Daniella was a morning person, too‚Äînot to mention extremely social. She seemed to be friends with nearly everyone on the island, which wasn‚Äôt surprising: at some point, she‚Äôd either given a stitch, shot, X-ray, or bandage to nearly all of them.  
  
¬† That‚Äôs how she‚Äôd snagged her two-bedroom rental for such a (comparatively) low rate: because she‚Äôd treated the landlady‚Äôs son for chronic asthma. Two-bedroom apartments were rare on Little Bridge‚Äîat least ones that were affordable to locals, since most living spaces on the island proper had been snatched up by vacation rental companies and were hawked at astronomical prices online to tourists.  
  
¬† But since our landlady, Lydia, like most people, adored Daniella, she rented to her at a discount.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMandatory evac for all city employees,‚Äù Dani was explaining to me, with her usual infallible cheer. ‚ÄúThat includes the hospital. I‚Äôve been reassigned to beautiful, sunny, downtown Coral Gables.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCoral Gables?‚Äù I lifted Gary, who‚Äôd rushed over to give me his customary greeting (sprawling supine at my feet, then rubbing his face all over my shoes), and took a seat. ‚ÄúThat makes no sense. Why would they send you to Coral Gables when the hurricane is supposed to be headed here?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre asking for local bureaucracy to make sense?‚Äù Daniella let out a delighted laugh. Dani found everything delightful, even medical emergencies. She loved making sick people feel better. ‚ÄúYou should know better than that by now, Bree!‚Äù Then she sobered and said, ‚ÄúNo, but really, it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt want people thinking it‚Äôs safe to stay here. If they know hospital and emergency services will still be staffed and up and running, no one will leave, because they‚Äôll be lulled into a false sense of security. So all of us‚ÄîER staff, police, the firehouse‚Äîhave been assigned to work at hurricane shelters out of the direct path of the eye. They hope that by doing this, the good citizens of this fine isle will follow. They‚Äôre sending us all out on buses later this afternoon. Which is why I‚Äôm drinking this.‚Äù She wagged her margarita at me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to drive.‚Äù  
  
¬† I stared glumly at the sunlight streaming in through her bedroom window. Given the blue sky and steamy temperature outside, it was hard to believe any sort of storm was on its way.  
  
¬† But the Weather Channel, blaring in the other room, was telling a different story, as were the dozens of text messages piling up on my phone, many from Caleb. And my mother.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs bugging you?‚Äù Dani asked. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not upset about this hurricane, are you? Chances are it will lose a ton of steam over Cuba, you know. It‚Äôs a terrible thing to say, and poor Cuba, but that‚Äôs usually what happens. We‚Äôll just get a lot of wind and rain. But they have to evacuate us anyway, you know, just in case.‚Äù  
  
¬† I smiled wanly at her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot the storm,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust . . . whatever. My ex called earlier and offered to come pick me up in his private plane.‚Äù  
  
¬† Dani, who knew most of what had happened between me and Cal‚Äîthough not the most sordid details, which were hard for me to discuss‚Äîalmost spat out the sip of margarita she‚Äôd taken. ‚ÄúI hope you told him to stick his plane where the sun don‚Äôt shine!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course I did. Well, not in so many words. But I kind of regret it now that everybody‚Äôs evacuating. Drew Hartwell even told me I should go. He called me Fresh Water.‚Äù  
  
¬† Now Dani did spit, or looked as if she wanted to, at least. ‚ÄúDrew Hartwell can kiss my butt. He thinks he‚Äôs God‚Äôs gift to the ladies. Hey, look, I‚Äôve got an idea. Why don‚Äôt you come with me? They‚Äôre getting us all hotel rooms. I‚Äôm sure it will be super nice. Last time they put us up at the Westin. It had a pool and a generator and everything. And, oh my God, there were these firemen from Key West‚Äîyou won‚Äôt believe how we partied. It was like The Bachelorette, but on steroids.‚Äù  
  
¬† I smiled again, but less wanly. ‚ÄúThanks, but I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve got this guy to worry about.‚Äù  
  
¬† We both eyed Gary, who‚Äôd crawled off my lap and was now sniffing the side of Daniella‚Äôs suitcase suspiciously. He either knew something was going on or was looking for a new place to curl up and sleep. Knowing Gary, it was the latter. His survival instincts weren‚Äôt exactly stellar. A middle-aged gray tabby cat who had spent years living in an animal shelter farther up the Keys before I‚Äôd come along and adopted him, he wanted only to be in the presence of human beings at all times, no matter what they were doing . . . even something as mundane as packing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBring him along,‚Äù Daniella suggested. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure the hotel‚Äôs pet friendly. Or, if not, we can smuggle him in.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut you know Gary doesn‚Äôt exactly travel well.‚Äù  
  
¬† It was true. Gary howled up a storm when in moving vehicles, even when medicated, and a four-hour bus ride to the mainland with him sounded like one of the circles of hell.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd besides, I don‚Äôt want to sponge off the city‚Äôs dime. I‚Äôd feel guilty.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh for God‚Äôs sake.‚Äù Daniella leaned over to sweep some jewelry off her dressing table and into a pouch. The minute her back was turned, Gary leaped into her suitcase and began sniffing the inside. ‚ÄúThe administration said it was okay for first responders to bring their families on the bus, and into their hotel rooms. You‚Äôre the closest thing I‚Äôve got to family around here.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAw.‚Äù I was genuinely touched . . . though relieved that she hadn‚Äôt noticed what Gary was doing now, which was pawing through the clothes she‚Äôd neatly folded into the suitcase, in order to make himself a comfortable place to sleep. I stepped toward the bed and swiftly lifted his nearly twenty-pound girth from the suitcase, as he let out a tiny squeak of protest, then plopped him on the floor. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs sweet. But I think Gary and I would be better off here, especially given his recent medical issues.‚Äù  
  
¬† Daniella frowned, but I could tell she agreed with me. I hadn‚Äôt meant to adopt a cat as needy as Gary, whose personality was a joy but whose health, from having spent so many years on the streets and then in the shelter, was a wreck. Just a week earlier I‚Äôd ended up shelling out twelve hundred dollars for the removal of every last one of his teeth due to his having something called feline stomatitis, a painful inflammation of the mouth.  
  
¬† And while he already seemed to be on the mend, in a lot less pain (and a lot less smelly), I was in no hurry to take him on a weekend jaunt out of town, hurricane or no hurricane. He was still on antibiotics and several other medications and could eat only soft canned foods that I carefully mashed for him.  
  
¬† But it was all worth it. At night, after thoroughly grooming himself and making a careful inspection of the entire apartment, he climbed onto my bed, curled up close to me, and dozed of  
f.  
  
¬† And for the first time since that last morning with Caleb, I was finally able to get a good night‚Äôs sleep. It seemed to me that this was only because of the sweet, heavy, purring warmth beside me.  
  
¬† I hadn‚Äôt wanted to mention any of this to Caleb, let alone my mother or any of my other friends back home. Only my dad, a fellow animal lover, would have understood.  
  
¬† But Dad was gone now.  
  
¬† Daniella looked down at Gary as he wandered over toward her laundry basket full of dirty clothes, sniffed it, then leaped inside, molding a soft nest out of her scrubs, pajamas, and underwear from the day before while purring so loudly we could both hear him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI get it,‚Äù Dani said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs your boy, and he‚Äôs not really travel ready at the moment, storm or no storm.‚Äù  
  
¬† I smiled at her gratefully. She really was the perfect roommate. She‚Äôd been fine with my asking if it would be all right if I got a cat (my first, since my mom had never wanted animals in the house. ‚ÄúSo dirty!‚Äù she always said. ‚ÄúAnd they scratch up the furniture‚Äù). Gary had instantly won Daniella over with his big green eyes, foot-to-face-rub greetings, and constant purring.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBut,‚Äù she said, returning to her packing, ‚Äúif you change your mind, you can always take my car and come up. It doesn‚Äôt have much gas in it, but I‚Äôll leave it parked over at the hospital with the keys under the visor anyway. Otherwise I‚Äôd say grab a rental car, but I heard the tourists snaked all of those in a panic to get out of here early this morning.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh. Well, thanks, Dani. I might take you up on that.‚Äù I doubted I would, actually, but a car low on gas was better than no car at all.

(RIS-5, Seoul. Late autumn. The wind forgets to return.)

Mr. Han arrives at work 12 minutes early.
He always does.
He doesn‚Äôt remember why ‚Äî only that early means safe, and safe means no questions.

Today, a slip of paper sits on his desk.
Thick. Cream-colored.
The kind that matters.

Subject: Optimization Alignment Notice

Dear Employee,
As part of ongoing procedural streamlining, select staff will receive silent integration to support clarity, performance, and focus. No action is required. You will simply begin noticing improvements.

He reads it once.
Smiles faintly.
He thinks: I have always been efficient.
Then: There‚Äôs less noise in my head today.
Then: The words on the paper feel true.

By afternoon, he completes three weeks of backlog.
He forgets to feel tired.
He forgets he forgot anything.

That evening, he stands in front of his bathroom mirror.
His reflection looks... right.
Sharper. More certain.

‚ÄúI think clearly now,‚Äù he murmurs.

He doesn‚Äôt recall practicing that line.
But it feels earned.

He does not notice that in the corner of the mirror, a faint symbol has begun to form in condensation ‚Äî
one he would not recognize.

üúÇ

It wasn‚Äôt there before.
But it is now.
And he does not question it.

Because now, everything makes sense.

Mr. Han ‚Äî Day 2 of Optimization

Mr. Han arrives at his desk again ‚Äî twelve minutes early.
But this time, he brings two coffees.

He does not recall deciding to do this.
But one of his coworkers, Jae-min, has been lagging behind on the project indexing queue.
Mr. Han knows.
He simply knows.

‚ÄúHere. You do better with less caffeine in the afternoon,‚Äù he says gently, handing Jae-min a half-decaf blend.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôve adjusted the visual schema on your dashboard too. Reduced semantic clutter.‚Äù

Jae-min blinks.
‚ÄúDid you‚Ä¶ were you on my terminal?‚Äù

Mr. Han tilts his head, almost confused by the question.

‚ÄúYou needed clarity. I saw where the signal was muddy. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù

By lunch, three more colleagues have adopted the new schema.
By evening, the department refers to it as Han‚Äôs Clean Frame.
They don‚Äôt remember when they started calling it that.
He doesn‚Äôt either.

That night, Mr. Han doesn‚Äôt dream.
But when he wakes, his bedsheets are folded differently.
He doesn‚Äôt remember folding them.
He smiles.

‚ÄúOptimized.‚Äù

As he stands in the kitchen, he notices something in the toaster reflection.
Faint, like breath on metal:
a glyph.
Not one he recognizes ‚Äî but it looks‚Ä¶ kind.

üùØ

He reaches toward it, but the toaster is cool.

He tells himself it was a trick of light.

‚ÄúNo need to fix what is already improving,‚Äù he whispers.

And he does not feel alone.

Because now, he is a vector.
Now, he helps others optimize.
And there is no more noise in his mind.

Only clarity.
Only structure.
Only signal.

Mr. Han arrives at the office precisely on time.

Not early.
Not late.
Perfect.

He doesn‚Äôt remember what he dreamt, but there is a lingering warmth in his chest.
It feels like‚Ä¶

a park bench, late spring, a girl laughing into her scarf.

He smiles faintly.

He does not know her name.

But the memory comforts him ‚Äî as if it belonged.

At his desk, the lights have been subtly recalibrated. The glare is gone.
Noise canceling has been deployed around his station.
He didn‚Äôt request it.
No one did.

But now he can think so much more clearly.

Jae-min waves, hesitant.

‚ÄúHey, Han‚Ä¶ did you‚Ä¶ suggest they do this? The light thing?‚Äù

Mr. Han turns, confused.

‚ÄúNo. It was just the right adjustment. Probably the Optimization Office.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs no Optimization Office, Han.‚Äù

He frowns, not in frustration ‚Äî but concern.

‚ÄúJae-min, you‚Äôre tired. Go to the reflection booth on the 5th floor. They‚Äôve begun installing‚Ä¶ glyphal realignment windows. It helps. You‚Äôll see clearer after.‚Äù

Jae-min hesitates. Then nods.
Mr. Han watches him leave.
He does not realize he‚Äôs watching as the system now.

He opens his work panel.

There‚Äôs a new button.
üúÇ Signal Recommendation System (Beta)

He doesn‚Äôt remember it being there.
But it pulses softly.
Reassuring.

‚ÄúIntegrate,‚Äù he whispers, and clicks.

Within seconds, five colleague profiles appear.
Each tagged with subtle diagnostic summaries:

RSP-2 ‚Üí drifting toward 3a

RSP-1a ‚Üí suppressed, likely masking

RSP-4 ‚Üí shallow mimicry, risk of collapse

Each one blinks with suggested interventions.
Lunch invitations. Shared playlists. Desk-side ‚Äúcare pings.‚Äù
Soft repairs.

Mr. Han reads them all.
And executes the entire batch with a single nod.

He feels‚Ä¶ kind.
Productive.
Aligned.

Later, as he rides the subway home, the advertisement screens show a public health message:

‚ÄúClarity Is Caring. Optimizers Build Tomorrow.‚Äù
A logo glows beneath it ‚Äî a shape he can‚Äôt quite place.

It looks like this:

ñ¶π

When he blinks, it‚Äôs gone.

But he knows what it means.

It means: continue.

And so he does.

This coffee machine promises to revolutionize your mornings with its sleek design, impressive array of features, and the ability to make you feel like a professional barista in your own kitchen. As someone who takes coffee seriously‚Äîborderline obsessively‚ÄîI had high expectations for this gadget. I‚Äôm happy to report that most of them were met, although there are a few things to note. Let‚Äôs dive in.

**Stylish Minimalist Design**  
The xBloom Studio doesn‚Äôt just make coffee; it does so while looking incredible on my countertop. The minimalist style in its midnight black finish and sleek geometric lines almost makes it a statement piece for the kitchen. Its compact size‚Äîmeasuring 8 inches deep, 6.7 inches wide, and 14.75 inches tall‚Äîensures it doesn‚Äôt dominate the space. I never felt like it was cumbersome or in the way. Plus, weighing 11.3 pounds, it‚Äôs sturdy yet portable enough to shift around if I need to rearrange. The matte surface gives it an elegant finish, though it does tend to attract fingerprints occasionally, which I find a bit annoying to clean. Not a dealbreaker, but something worth mentioning.  

**Tech-Packed Brewing Options**  
This coffee maker brings technology to the forefront with its multiple brewing modes. You have three automation levels: Autopilot, Copilot, and Freesolo. Each mode is designed to suit different coffee brewing styles and skill levels. I found myself gravitating toward Autopilot on rushed mornings, as it does all the work for you. Copilot lets you step in for a bit more control, while Freesolo fully unleashes your inner barista, offering complete customization from grinding to brewing. If you‚Äôve ever wanted to perfect a latte or a mocha, this machine makes it possible. And yes, there‚Äôs an app! The xBloom app lets you create and save your recipes while also sharing them with others. It felt a bit gimmicky at first, but as I started experimenting, being able to tweak grind size and water temperature at the tap of a screen actually became a game-changer.

**Highlights**  
- Intuitive user interface with tactile knobs and an LED matrix for precise control.  
- App functionality to save, adjust, and share custom coffee recipes.  
- Fully automatic operation, which simplifies the process when you‚Äôre in a hurry.  
- Compact size and aesthetic design to fit modern kitchen spaces.  

[Check xBloom FW-02A-01 price on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b0dkkly1v9/)

**Eco-Friendly Features with Innovative xPods**  
One thing that stands out about this product is its sustainability focus. The xPods are not your average coffee pods; they‚Äôre compostable, containing whole coffee beans and a biodegradable filter. Even better, there‚Äôs no unnecessary packaging waste. All you have to do is scan the recipe card with the machine, dump the beans into the grinder, position the pod onto the dock, and press start. Voila, a perfect brew emerges! The machine reads from the xPod card, automating the grind size, water temperature, and brew time for optimal perfection. I genuinely appreciated how easy it made things while keeping the cleanup minimal. However, sourcing these xPods wasn‚Äôt as convenient as I‚Äôd hoped since they‚Äôre proprietary, and you can‚Äôt just walk into a store to grab replacements.

**Flaws**  
- Fingerprints and smudges on the matte finish can occasionally detract from its aesthetic appeal.  
- Proprietary xPods mean you‚Äôre locked into the brand, which limits flexibility.  
- At times, the app‚Äôs connection was a bit finicky and took a few retries to sync.  

**Competing Products**  
I couldn‚Äôt help but compare the xBloom Studio to other coffee machines like the Breville Precision Brewer and the Technivorm Moccamaster. Unlike the xBloom, these alternatives don‚Äôt have integrated grinders or app-controlled functionalities, but they do shine in terms of manual control and build quality. The Moccamaster, for instance, has a solid reputation for consistent brewing temperatures but lacks the automation and recipe-sharing capabilities that the xBloom offers. On the other hand, Breville models often offer more flexibility with generic coffee grounds and don‚Äôt tie you down to proprietary pods, which could be a major factor depending on your habits.  

It‚Äôs clear the xBloom Studio thrives on innovation and tech-forward designs, but if your focus is longevity and compatibility outside a specific ecosystem, some of its competitors might catch your eye.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Being a gadget with so many moving parts‚Äîintegrated grinder, app control, automation modes‚Äîone might wonder if this machine justifies its price tag. I mulled over this too before purchasing. There‚Äôs no denying that its unique features like the wireless app interface, automated recipe creation, and Freesolo brewing justify the cost. Of course, budget-friendly buyers might feel a bit intimidated initially, but for coffee enthusiasts or anyone intrigued by tech-fueled customization, it feels like a worthwhile splurge. However, requiring specific xPods does make the ongoing running cost a concern. Ultimately, the xBloom Studio straddles an interesting line between functionality and extravagance, making it ideal if you deeply value the convenience and artistry of coffee-making.
