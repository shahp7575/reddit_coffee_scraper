1r6vyqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrimeManhood/comments/1r6vyqo/how_to_flirt_without_the_pickup_artist_bs/,How to Flirt Without the Pickup Artist BS: Psychological Tricks That Actually Work,"Spent way too long analyzing flirting dynamics because I got tired of sucking at it. Read through evolutionary psychology research, watched way too many communication breakdown videos, listened to podcasts from relationship experts. Turns out most advice out there is either manipulative garbage or Disney channel level naive.

The real issue? We're fighting against our own biology while also trying to use it. Your brain wants to protect you from rejection so it either makes you freeze up or overcompensate with tryhard energy. Meanwhile her brain is subconsciously screening for like 47 different signals at once. No wonder this feels impossible sometimes.

Here's what actually moves the needle based on research and field testing:

**Create artificial scarcity through time constraints**

Sounds counterintuitive but mentioning you can only chat for a minute reduces her guard instantly. Dr. Robert Cialdini talks about this in ""Influence"" (the OG book on persuasion psychology, dude has decades of research backing this up). When someone knows the interaction has a natural endpoint, they relax. Their brain stops treating you as a potential threat or time vampire. I've legit seen this work in real time, it's wild. You approach, make light conversation, casually drop ""I've got to meet my friend in like 2 minutes but I had to say hi"" and suddenly the pressure evaporates for both of you. Works at coffee shops, bars, grocery stores, wherever. If the vibe is good, the conversation naturally extends anyway.

**Master the push-pull dynamic without being a dick about it**

This isn't about playing mind games. It's about creating emotional variance which keeps dopamine flowing. Basically you alternate between showing interest and pulling back slightly. Compliment her taste in music then playfully challenge her opinion on the best artist. Neuroscience shows our brains are wired to chase intermittent rewards way more than constant validation. But here's the key, you're not doing this to manipulate. You're doing it because it creates genuine playful tension that makes interactions fun for both people. The book ""Models"" by Mark Manson breaks this down perfectly (dude used to be in the pickup community but wrote this to combat all the toxic stuff, super refreshing read). He emphasizes being authentic while understanding these dynamics exist.

**Use strategic vulnerability early**

Most guys either overshare trauma dumps or stay surface level boring. Neither works. Strategic vulnerability means sharing something slightly embarrassing or self-deprecating early in conversation. Research from Brené Brown's work on connection shows vulnerability creates intimacy faster than anything else. But it has to be calibrated. Not ""my ex destroyed me and I have trust issues"" but more like ""I completely blanked on my coworker's name today after working with him for 6 months, stood there like an idiot."" It shows you're human, don't take yourself too seriously, and you're comfortable with imperfection. Creates psychological safety for her to let her guard down too.

If these concepts click but you want to go deeper without reading dozens of books, there's an app called BeFreed that's been useful. It's a personalized learning platform that pulls from relationship psychology books, research papers, and expert interviews to create custom audio learning plans. You can type in something specific like ""improve my social confidence as an introvert"" and it builds a structured plan with adjustable depth, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, you can switch between different styles depending on your mood. It covers all the books mentioned here plus way more, and helps connect the dots between different concepts in a way that actually sticks.

**Leverage the Ben Franklin effect**

Wild psychological phenomenon where asking someone for a small favor actually makes them like you more. Sounds backwards but it works because their brain justifies why they'd do you a favor, concludes they must like you. ""Hey, can you watch my stuff for a sec while I grab a coffee?"" or ""Which of these two options looks better to you?"" Gets them invested in a tiny way. Then you've created a micro-connection. Discussed heavily in social psychology research, easy to test yourself.

**Create inside jokes stupid fast**

Shared humor releases oxytocin and creates artificial history together. Notice something quirky in your environment and build a callback to it throughout conversation. ""There's our nemesis again"" about someone hogging the cafe outlet. Sounds dumb but it works because you're creating a mini shared world only you two are in on. Makes 5 minute interaction feel like you've known each other longer.

**Perfect your exit before your entrance**

Most guys optimize for the approach then crash and burn on the exit. Having a smooth, non-needy exit is crucial. If she seems interested, ""I'm gonna get back to my friend but we should continue this conversation, are you around this week?"" If she's not vibing, ""Cool chatting with you, have a great day"" then leave with your dignity intact. The book ""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer (ex FBI behavior analyst, insanely good read on influence and rapport) talks about how endings matter more than beginnings for lasting impressions. Don't linger hoping things will turn around. Read the room and exit confidently.

Also check out Charisma on Command YouTube channel. Owen's breakdowns of actual flirting interactions from movies and real life show you what these principles look like in action. Not cringey pickup stuff, actual communication analysis.

**Match then lead energy levels**

Basic mirroring psychology. If she's chill and introverted, don't come in like a golden retriever on cocaine. If she's high energy, don't be a monotone robot. Start by matching her energy to build rapport, then gradually lead it where you want it to go (usually slightly more playful/flirtatious). Builds unconscious comfort.

The bottom line is this, flirting isn't about tricks or tactics to ""get"" someone. It's about understanding psychological principles that make human connection easier and less awkward for everyone involved. Use them to facilitate genuine interaction, not manipulate outcomes. The guys who succeed long term aren't the ones with the best tricks but the ones who internalize these principles until they become natural.",1,1771301370.0,PrimeManhood,0,1.0,False
1r6vy6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1r6vy6h/how_much_difference_does_the_roaster_really_make/,How much difference does the roaster really make?,"I am starting to wonder how much does the roaster actually influence the flavour of a coffee. I mean, if they don’t butcher the roasting by roasting uneven or burning the bean, would it truly make a significant difference if you source the same bean (same farm, same variety, same process) from two different roasters that are using a medium light roast profile?

I had an amazing Red Bourbon from Finca el Jardín (Honey) roasted by Amaya Coffee at a coffee shop. It was fantastic and I was not able to get a bag from Amaya - they already sold out.  But if I Google the farm, variety and process two or three roasters pop up. I am thinking that 90% of the flavour profile is in the bean, and the roaster is just surfing that wave. Am I wrong? 

I would love to hear any experience with this. I am trying g to shift buying decision criteria from roaster to bean. I’ve been using both, but I am guessing chasing a good bean is probably more important. Thoughts?",1,1771301323.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cat. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Recently started playing D&D.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

You're you.

You're visiting Seoul, Korea.

Why seoul korea? because I said so, it's my article.

You're a digital no mad so you need to find a cafe to work from.

You search online and find one near by.

Nice.

As you step in, you're taken aback by how calm and beautiful the space is.

Everyone there is so quiet, and busy chatting in a very calm and low tone with their friend.

Jazz music is playing in the background to set the scene.

The coffee smell floats through the air like a visible wavy line that pulls you in.

You lock eyes with the barista. She nods and smiles — that's her way of saying hello.

You smile back.

You look to find a place to sit down, and it just so happen to be at the very end of the cafe.

Mind you the cafe is not that big, it can only host 12 people. There's only one spot left, yours.

You sit down to order an Ice Americano on an empty stomach.

Your favourite breakfast.

You open up your computer, set up your stand and keyboard.

The Ice Americano makes its way to you.

You gotta take a **shit**.

You look around and notice there's only one washroom and it's by the entrance.

You're sitting all the way inside the coffee shop, on the opposite end.

If you get up and go to the washroom, everyone is going to see you, they know where you're headed and have a pretty good guess what you're about to do.

At the core you're just a social animal are you not?

You care about what others think of you.

So you're faced with a tough decision

>Do I get up, drop this deuce and everyone will know? or do I sit down, suffer and ""fit in""?

It's really not easy...

To make matters worse you notice a couple of cute girls that you would have loved to talk to *( I'm assuming you're a man reading this, if you're a woman, assume there's a couple of cute K-POP Look a like guys sitting, and if you're gay, you're gay)*

You handle business, you feel great.

But shit... enough time has passed to make it impossible to guess what you did there.

It's very clear what has just happened...

You weren't taking a piss.... no no no you were taking a **SHIT**.

""omg he's been in there for 10 minutes""

""ew it smells""

But now you have to leave the washroom, and the longer you stay in the washroom, the worst it gets.

Does that sound familiar?

That's right baby I""m about to hit you with another analogy.

THE LONGER YOU SIT IN YOUR SHITTY *(pun intended)* APARTMENT, SHITTY MINDSET, SHITTY WHATEVER, THE WORSE IT'S GOING TO BE.

YOUR THOUGHTS WILL EAT YOU UP.

RIP THE GODDAMN BANDAID AND JUST GO.

LEAVE!

YOU'RE GETTING JUDGED REAGARDLESS IF YOU STAY IN THERE OR IF YOU WALK OUT

BETTER YET THERE'S A BIGGER CHANCE SINCE IT'S 2026 MOST PEOPLE ARE TOO BUSY ON THEIR PHONE TO EVEN HAVE NOTICED YOU GO IN THE WASHROOM

SO JUST

STOP THINKING

START DOING

RETARDMAXXX

So where are we at?

Right, you're now faced with another decision

You have to walk out, you have no choice. 

The rest of that Ice Americano isn't going to drink itself. So the choice here is **how** will you walk out.

Will you

A) Walk of shame, head down, running back to your seat

OR

B) Head up, shoulders squared, fuck it, make eye contact with the girl you think is cute?

The thing is I know that you reading this, aren't the average joe

You decided to read an article titled *"" You have to take a shit in a public bathroom to be successful ""*

So of course you go with Option B, cause your mama didn't raise a bitch.

You just destroyed that toilet but you don't care.

You had to handle business, you had to do what you had to do.

Can you sense the 3rd analogy that's about to hit?

Brother ( sister idk), sometimes in life, and especially in business you gotta do unpleasant shit *( pun intended* ***AGAIN****)*

You gotta handle business even when it's ugly, and you better do it with your shoulders squared and your head held up high.

# Final Thoughts

I don't need to wait for a robbery at a bank to happen *( although I would love to live that fantasy)* to test my character.

I can seek out character tests in my day to day activity.

Like taking a shit in a 12 person coffee shop that only has one bathroom in Seoul korea.

If you're too embarrassed to take a shit in public and then walkout like nothing has happened, you're NGMI.

Chapter 1 – Family

Smile. That is the first rule of the circus.

In the morning, the table is usually already set. Nahla makes a point of waking up earlier than the rest of us. Apparently, the French have a habit of eating together, I think it’s cute. Which doesn’t change the fact that our patience always runs out before the bread does. And that’s not very cute.

This circus is made up of a type of people that I like to call “misfits.” I laugh just remembering how many grumpy faces I’ve pulled from Horácio when I referred to them that way.

Horácio is an American of I-don’t-know-how-many years old with graying hair. He always walks hunched like a shrimp. His voice is a mix between a badly hinged door creaking and the calmness of a threat. The guy is nothing but bones, that’s the truth.

But despite the jokes, I must admit that Horácio is the best fortune teller that I, or anyone in this circus, has ever seen. Dragging his rags that he calls clothes across the floor, Horácio appears before the audience — when he wants to, that is, rarely — without introductions. He points his finger at the crowd, staring fixedly at the “victim” of the day, and proclaims their sentence or blessing. Usually, when the old man decides to show up, it is not a good sign.

Horácio is our death. And “death” sat down at the table sniffling, making Nahla frown and cross her arms.

“Is this serious, Horácio? I already asked you to clean your nose before sitting at the table, and not under the table.” Nahla stated seriously.

“I beg your pardon, Miss Nahla,” he buried his face in his own sleeve and dragged it across his nostrils leaving a trail of green mucus, “but I don’t give a fuck.”

The old man grabbed a piece of bread with such conviction. “Ah, shit,” I thought. He was going to throw it at Nahla, that would make the girl scream, and Lydia would show up to argue with Horácio. And there goes our supposedly “peaceful” breakfast.

“Mediocre French people…” he muttered before bringing the bread to his crooked teeth and chewing loudly.

Today would be one of those days.

“Don’t mind him, Naná, the arthritis must be messing with our blind man’s mood.” Lydia announced as she sat at the table with a sideways smile, leaning toward Horácio. Ironic and elegant. Our clown.

“For your information, it is not ‘blind,’ the more appropriate medical term would be—”

“Blind!” Her black hair flew when she stood up in a sudden movement, slamming her fists on the table, making the cutlery tremble. “Now shut your trap before I actually get stressed for real, Fergunson.”

Horácio wiped his nose again, leaned back taking the chair with him, which let out a shrill creak against the wooden floor. With an ironic smile he dropped the rest of the bread onto the plate and continued:

“But of course. Miss Lydia.” He left, tapping his cane against the floor.

“Unloved.” Lydia muttered and turned to us at the table. “Now that he has received his daily dose of attention, I believe we can have the breakfast that Naná prepared so kindly for us.”

“Good morning!” Ramessés announced.

“That was just what was missing…”

◆◆◆

After long twenty minutes of an endless argument about who had the best maintained hair between Lydia and Ramessés, we finally heard his footsteps.

All of us stood up quickly, dropping the cutlery, fixing our posture, hands on the chairs, eyes raised. That was the routine.

Each step marked the seconds of anticipation. His heavy boots hit firmly against the floor. Even though he was not physically large, his energy spread throughout the entire room. Damn it, I always get nervous at moments like this. The white mask covered his face. The red ruffles were sealed with multicolored glitter. The sleeves were long, wide, and had a blue edge with crooked lines spreading across the torso. Show-off.

“Good morning, my family.”

His velvety, almost pacifying voice brought a comfortable and safe energy when he was around. It was as if a helmet were placed on your head and every word of his echoed inside it. I felt protected and guided. But you know that no matter how beautiful and resistant the helmet is, if you wear one it usually means that…

You are not safe.

We looked at each other with an anxious glance and nodded, answering in unison:

“Good morning, Maestro!”

The Maestro took the seat at the head of the table. When he sat down, we followed, retaking our places in silence. He turned to us, the mask did not allow us to see his eyes, only half of his mouth. Which was already enough for us to know that he was smiling. And of course, we smiled back.

If you can call that a smile.

Lydia always tightens her jaw well before lifting the corners of her mouth, keeping her lips pressed together. When it came to smiling, Lydia could not be followed as an example. Unlike Ramessés, who adjusted some strands of his long brown fringe that covered his cheek. His green eyes fixed on the Maestro as if observing every movement, with a genuine smile from ear to ear.

Ramessés was a pain in the ass, with his upturned nose and a talent as a magician that was irritatingly incredible. Being vain and confident as he is, I bet that not knowing what the Maestro’s hair looked like frustrated him deeply.

And Nahla noticed that confidence. That smile motivated the girl to widen her own, showing perfectly straight teeth with contagious positivity. Her legs swung under the table, bright and hesitant eyes occasionally searched for the Maestro’s.

“Your eyes have been exceptionally distinct lately, Nahla.” He brought a cup of coffee to his lips, which retracted in slight displeasure. Calmly, his gloved hands embraced the sugar bowl. Spoon after spoon was poured into the hot liquid.

But of course they are distinct, Nahla has one eye of each color. Her right eye was a turquoise blue that resembled the sky. If possible, I would even say that is why she lives with her head in the clouds. And the other was coffee-brown. The same shade as the Maestro’s coffee. Too sweet.

“Where are the twins?” he asked while drinking the coffee again, with a satisfied expression, without looking at anyone specifically.

“They are on stage with Greta, sir.” Lydia said promptly.

“I called them to join us,” Nahla murmured looking down, stirring a spoon inside her cup. “But Artie and Willow said they had experiments to do, and that they would call Greta to help them.”

“What experiments?” the Maestro inquired, turning to Nahla.

“I don’t know. But you know how the twins are. They must be twisting themselves around like they always do.”

“Or they asked Greta to do the work for them.” Ramessés commented with a malicious smile at the corner of his mouth, looking with half-closed eyes at Lydia. One hand under his raised chin, enjoying the situation.

“In that case they must have already died.” I added, copying Rami, resting my chin on the back of my hands, smiling at Nahla.

“Shit.” Lydia stomped her foot on the floor, standing up firmly, adjusting her clothes. “I will solve this, sir.” She turned and left with hurried steps through the door.

I stood up and went after her with a wide smile, laughing quietly. I ran through the corridors of the circus and everything was chaos! I almost tripped twice over the boxes that a certain lazy magician swore he had organized. I bet it was just another of his tricks where from afar everything looks organized. After jumping over ropes, hitting my foot and cursing up to the fifth generation of Ramessés, I finally reached the red curtain that separated all that mess from the circus stage.

Crossing the long, heavy crimson fabric, I looked around trying to locate myself. The confetti cannon was almost glued to me — great, I was in one of the corners. Phew, thank God. I was afraid that upon crossing the curtain I would end up face to face with the twins twisting their backs. Ouch! My back hurts just thinking about it!

“Good morning, Dmitri!”

Huh? I turned to the stage and there they were. Artie was lying on a narrow wooden bed, tied with ropes that tightly wrapped around his wrists and ankles. Greta was turning a large crank connected to tubes attached to the bed that pulled the restraints.

“Ahh!… that’s it, Greta! Hahaha!”

Artie oscillated between laughing hysterically and biting his lips, arching his eyebrows, almost like an expression of pleasure. His back arched with each crack of his body, pulling guttural moans from his throat. Having his body stretched by Greta seemed to leave him in ecstasy.

“Give up, Artie! You’re not going to beat my record!” Willow shouted amid the boy’s laughter, which echoed across the stage. Standing right in front of the wooden bed, Willow laughed quietly listening to the noises Artie’s body made with each turn of the crank.

A crack, a moan.

Another crack, eyes rolling back.

One more crack and the one feeling the body ache now was me.

I immediately covered my ears — Ouch, that hurts! Bunch of lunatics! No wonder those two have already been admitted to dozens of psychiatric hospitals.

“Greta! Stop that right now!” Lydia shouted from the other side of the stage, slamming her clenched fist against the other cannon.

“Good morning, Miss Lydia!” Greta dropped the crank abruptly, showing a welcoming smile.

“Ah, don’t worry, haha! The boy here can handle a few more minutes.” She looked at Artie who was panting with flushed cheeks. “Right, Artie?”

Before Artie could answer, Lydia immediately cut him off:

“That’s enough of this shit you’re doing! Greta, untie that boy right now!” She glared at Willow with a severe look. I could swear there was smoke coming out of her head.

“And you, girl, explain to me exactly what you thought you were doing.”

“Agh! How boring! We were just competing to see who could endure the—”

“Greta’s medieval torture bed!?”

“That’s it! Hahaha! And guess who won!?”

“The Maestro will hear about this, young lady.” Lydia muttered before turning to Greta, who had finished removing Artie’s restraints.

The guy looked like a drug addict. Platinum hair completely tangled, cheeks still flushed on his pale face. His gray eyes were taken by a deep darkness.

Delirious, Artie grabbed his sister’s wrist, also marked by the same shackles that had just restrained the boy. Smiling, he leaned toward her ear and whispered loudly enough that I, who was coiling the ropes nearby, could hear.

“I only didn’t win this time because the clown showed up, heard that little sister? It didn’t count as a victory.”

“You wouldn’t have lasted two more minutes before Greta dislocated your limbs, Artie.”

He leaned even closer to Willow.

“And what would be the problem, sis?”

I felt my stomach twisting. Nahla’s bread wanting to return to the plate. I think I don’t want to be here anymore. Giving a stage to weirdos is the Maestro’s fetish, not mine.

Willow mirrored her brother’s smile, even wider, the same type she makes when she is angry. Slowly she closed the distance between them, her lips brushing Artie’s ear with each word.

“You’re right, little brother… I would love to see you breaking yourself completely just to lose to me in the end. Like an idiot, hahaha!”

The twin, without blinking, replied:

“Good to know we’re still on the same page, sis.”

◆◆◆

After the twins’ incident, Lydia and I explained to the Maestro what had happened.

“I will have a conversation with the two of them later. You handled the situation very well, with maturity and patience. I am very proud of you.” The Maestro slid his fingers softly through the strands of my hair, slowly caressing.

I hate when he does that. The way my skin prickles, my breathing grows heavy, and I become drowsy even though I’m not sleepy. I want him to take his hand out of my hair. But my mouth doesn’t open. The words don’t come out. My body doesn’t move. I can only accept it. Accept that kindness that I never knew whether it was real or not.

“Just don’t forget that tonight we will have a performance.” He commented, turning in my direction. “And you, Dmitri, don’t forget to rehearse, alright?”

I feel my chest tightening. The air refusing to fill my lungs as the tips of his fingers brush even more.

“Of course, Maestro.”

But of course I will rehearse, Maestro. I will do my best for the family. I am the Interpreter of the circus after all. After so many years, I finally have an important role. Unlike when I was just another acrobat. Just a dirty and bored brat. Until the circus came to my city.

Until the Maestro, who was withdrawing his fingers from my strands, finally let them go, turned his back on us and disappeared as he walked out the door with Lydia accompanying him.

Alone, I went to my room, closed the door and lay down on the bed. I already felt tired and the day had barely begun. Tonight I will sing for dozens of people, maybe even hundreds, without a doubt the circus will be full. Just thinking about the shouting already makes my head start to ache.

My life in the circus is exhausting, but at least it is much better to be inside the circus than outside it. I remember that a few years ago, before I became one of the “misfits,” I was a dirty brat who overnight fell completely in love with the circus.

Shows. Strange people. Euphoria. All of that was new to my fourteen-year-old self at the time. I heard that some great circus of broken dolls, or something like that, would be coming to my city and that they would put on several shows. When they told me that the circus did not allow children, I sneaked in with a piece of red fabric that I had cut with a kitchen knife from the circus’s own tent. With my perfect disguise, leaning against the wall, I was able to watch the end of the performance.

The bleachers were packed, people applauded loudly, screamed like animals. It was all so strange and at the same time so exciting.

A blonde girl with boyish hair entered performing acrobatics in the air before grabbing the trapeze. A muscular black-haired woman brought a trail of flames that spread across the stage. She blew into enormous staffs that produced terrifying fire monsters. At first, I couldn’t tell if Greta was really a woman, she was so muscular. I found it quite strange for a while, but then I started liking her for being stronger than many men, like Ramessés.

And after all the chaos, the man in the white mask and red clothes appeared to close the performance.

As much as I can’t remember many details, I remember the surreal feeling I felt after I left. It was a feeling that everything was possible. A spirit inside me burned and begged me to return. I didn’t even sleep that day.

The next morning, with deep dark circles under my eyes, I left home and went to knock on the circus door. And the one who answered me was the Maestro.

“Yes, young man? How may I be of service?”

“I… uh…” I trembled with nervousness, I had no idea how to act near that masked man. “I admit that yesterday I watched part of the show and… I know I shouldn’t have but I want to, actually, I need to enter this circus, I couldn’t sleep all night! Yesterday’s performance was incredible, and it made me feel more alive than ever, please, I beg you! Accept me!”

The Maestro leaned forward, tilting his head from one side to the other as if he were analyzing me.

“Do you have any talent, boy?” he asked casually.

“I can run very well… like really well. I can also read and—”

“Do you happen to have any type of allergy, physical illness, addiction, neurological disorder, psychological, pathological, syndromes, or any type of limitation?”

I paused confused, what did all those long words mean? Was he a doctor? Or maybe my dark circles had scared him.

“Uhhh… I don’t know, sir. Does not having a mother count as a limitation?”

He stood still in silence for a few seconds, looking down. His voice, which had been so calm before, now sounded like a growl forced out of his throat.

“Why do you want to enter the circus, boy?”

That caught me off guard. I thought he would ask about my mother, about my name, my age, or what I liked to do. Why couldn’t he just be normal? I wrapped my sweaty hands in my shirt. I felt that if I lied he would somehow find out. So with my throat tightening, my heart racing, and a fear of something I didn’t even know what it was, I forced myself to tell the truth.

“I want to be special… like the rest of the circus.”

I want the warmth, the excitement, and for all the applause to be for me. I want to be the star.

His head tilted to the side, his hands hesitated for a moment, until he grabbed me and… hugged me. Tight. So… good.

“Welcome…” He continued, looking at me as if asking something.

“Dmitri. My name is Dmitri.”

“Welcome to the Circus of Dead Toys, Dmitri. Ah, and don’t forget…” he held my chin, lifting it toward him.

Smile.

I'm not sure what this post is all about and i really don't want to use AI because that wouldn't make this post real. So to give you my bg I'm from Ahmedabad (23 M) and I have a boring life tbh (I mean i don't have many friends but yeah that'll change soon. I'm in IT so I work on weekdays, but that's pretty much monotonous, even on weekends I don't know how to spend that.)

Now that the boring part is over, I can talk about the good things that really made me come here and post this on reddit. I always applied to multiple events asking them if I could volunteer there but I never received any replies (ghosted majorly). After so much waiting, I came across a story from an event that was happening on 14th & 15th Feb in Ahmedabad and they wanted some volunteers. I filled up the form, got selected and when the day came, I was excited to be there. I don't want to go into the particulars of the event coz i mean it's pretty difficult to fit all things in one paragraph. LOL 🫠. Just to summarize the event, it was basically a flea which is where all the local businesses come and sell their products, art, etc.

Okay, so from the start of the event I was never inside, i just stayed near the booking counter and for 6 hours straight I saw how many ppl came with their friends, their valentine, families. The vibe and the moments that shaped the whole event was bang on! Laughter, Love, Masti, Food, Coffee, blah blah....Pure Happiness inside me :)

In that chaos, I had so many questions like:

\-> Should I be in tech? Honestly whoever i have ever asked this question and they know me to a certain degree have always said that you are good in it and you should excel in that. BUT i always felt maybe I didn't learn anything else that's why nobody never saw any other skills in me.

\-> I haven't been in a relationship for so long ig 4 years and it makes me so frustrated that I'm not able to hold a conversation with anyone whom I might like, nor do i know what ppl want these days. How do I start? ( Ik generic advices would be there to work on yourself, go to gym, etc.)

\-> If I could connect with anyone who's working in events, especially non-shaadi ones. I would love to connect with you and know if I would be a useful resource in this industry.

I’ve been going to the gym for about 30-40 mins 3-4 days a week. I lift mainly. I’m trying to lose weight and gain some muscle right now. Some things  are hard to do as I have bad knees, hips and back. I need workouts that may stretch and strengthen those areas. (I’m not sure if that’s the total issue) I tried to do squats with a smith machine and my knees couldn’t take it. So I use the other single machines (the ones that target “one” area at a time).

How long should it take you to do a set? I usually do 3 sets of 8 on anything that I’m doing. 

I work in an office so I’m not running around a lot.

When do I incorporate protein shakes? Can I use them to “skip” a meal?

 I usually try to fast for 12-16 hours if I can. 

I do usually drink coffee with creamer in the morning though too. 

Sorry for all the jumping around. I just have a lot of questions. 😩 thank you in advance ",1,1771300520.0,beginnerfitness,1,1.0,False

There is a drive thru safari a couple hours away that we’d never been to so we decided that would be a fun thing to do for the day. During the drive there we stopped at a starbucks to get coffee to treat the birthday girl with and also because the rest of us just wanted coffee. So after a while we arrived and immediately went to do the drive thru safari part, got tickets and stuff and drove up to the bit to start. We got on our way and immediately it was one of the best things ever. We were having a blast together all up until I really had to pee. I thought it would be fine but the coffee really ran through me and went straight to my bladder and now like halfway through the safari I had to pee so bad. We were driving really slowly to see all the animals so I asked if we could speed up so I could go pee sooner but the girls didnt want to miss a bunch of the safari due to speeding back to the front. The map they gave us didnt show any places to stop to pee so I was completely screwed. So I just kinda accepted the situation and told them I was just gonna have to pee in the car, so in the backseat surrounded by my friends, including sitting right beside 2 of them, I quickly finished the last of my cold coffee, dropped trou and squatted while holding my empty cup up to my bits and just wee’d right there. And of course, I love my friends but they werent ready to just let this happen quietly, so theyre all just watching me, laughing their asses off while my entire ass is out, also with one of them recording the moment “for the memories”, so ive got a phone pointed at me while im doing my business. So I finish my pee, most stressful and spectated pee if ever done, and pull up my pants and we just have to sit and finish the tour with my cup of pee just sitting on the center console and as soon as we finish I grab the cup to dash off to the toilets to empty me pee cup. Rest of the day went well with it being brought up constantly, as well as having the video of me peeing uploaded on socials (with my blessing, and thankfully with nothing too bad showing, just my pee and a few seconds of my butt). So if there a moral of the story, pee before you got on a drive thru safari, especislly with others in the car.

TLDR: went to a drive thru safari and drank a large coffee before which made me have to pee in a cup in the car in the safari with my friends around me",10,1771300337.0,tifu,12,0.92,False

I really appreciated it and I can’t thank you enough for your support. Today was my birthday, so I figured I’d just write a bit and say what all went down.

My plans changed slightly, as things with my friend fell through last-minute. But instead of telling my parents this, I went to the animal shelter (that they don’t like me going to) and walked dogs there for a couple of hours. Then, when I was on my way to leave the shelter and get my birthday drink from Starbucks, I heard this little beagle whimpering and I asked the staff if I could take him with me. So I did. I got my drink, he got a pup cup, and I walked him for a mile out in this backroads area. He had a blast. Then we went to another coffee shop for another birthday drink, got another pup cup, and went for another walk. He had his head in my lap on the way back to the shelter. I felt so happy. 

After that, I went and got a third drink from a third coffee shop (yay free drinks!) and then went and visited the same aunt who babysat my  brother. We went for a hike and watched the Olympics. I did get an angry text from my mom, as she had found out that I wasn’t with my friend and was upset that I hadn’t told her what my new plans were. I just ignored it. Then my dad texted and asked if I could come home, as my mom wanted to see me. I made it home about 7:30.

Mom wasn’t too happy, but she was definitely trying to keep it subtle. She didn’t greet me and was very pointed with her questions. She wasn’t happy that I hadn’t told her earlier about my plans falling through, because she would have taken me out to lunch. I did not want her to take me out to lunch (I didn’t tell her that). She also didn’t seem happy that I spent the day at the shelter. But she didn’t yell at me, which I’ll take. I watched some more Olympics with her and then got ready for bed. She and I then got on the subject of coffee (my sister and I go out for coffee once a week, sometimes I pay for both of our drinks) and she got upset that sometimes I pay for both of us. It started with her saying that I shouldn’t pay when I’m the only one who drives us places (which is true, I’ll admit) but then turned into her talking about my future medical school and how I’m going to be in debt and how coffee adds up in the long term and it’s going to make me broke. She then got mad at my dad for saying that my sister and I could discuss our coffee arrangements like the adults we are. She said loudly that Dad’s a coward who avoids confrontation when he went into the other room, then got upset with me when I said that was better than him being like one of the husbands on her reality shows. I was getting sick and tired of things so I just eventually told her that I would talk to my sister and we would pay for our own drinks all of the time from there on out. She didn’t seem too satisfied, but she didn’t push things. I’m just worried now that she will get mad at my sister, who will get mad at me for telling Mom that I’ve bought her drinks sometimes, and…yeah, it’s a whole thing.

Does this all make sense? My aunt bought me my first-ever drink tonight, and I’ve been straight as an arrow my entire life, so I am feeling slightly out of sorts. Nothing too bad, just very drowsy (although that might be a bit of a placebo effect too, I don’t know). But I feel like I’m rambling here. Point is: Mom’s been a bit difficult, but I had a great day regardless. I spent my day the way I wanted and got out of most confrontations. I’ll take it! Thanks again to everyone for your support!

My dad has CLL with 96% involvement in his bone marrow per recent biopsy. His platelets are low, and over the past two weeks his anemia has worsened very very quickly.

Recent timeline:

Hospitalized with hemoglobin \~7.5 and fever (103°F), no clear infection source found.

A few days later hemoglobin dropped to 5.3–5.5 → required two transfusions.

After transfusion it rose briefly to 8.2–8.5.

Discharged home.

Friday hemoglobin was 7.2.

He had an outpatient transfusion today (Monday), but post-transfusion hemoglobin is only 6.9.

He’s fatigued, short of breath when talking, and coughing some tonight and feeling weak. He previously had blood in urine (improved after stopping Eliquis), but he mentioned dark/“coffee-colored” urine again two days ago.

His oncologist plans to start zanubrutinib this week. He was previously on ibrutinib.

I’m trying to understand:

Is this likely marrow failure from heavy CLL involvement?

Could this be autoimmune hemolytic anemia?

How common is transfusion dependency with this level of marrow involvement?

Has anyone switched from ibrutinib to zanubrutinib in a similar situation?

Any shared experiences would really help.

1r6vjlx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r6vjlx,Threatened by Chesilhurst Farm - UPDATE to last post,"Well, shortly after my last post, I did get a response from Chesilhurst Farm!

For context, I have posted the email that I originally sent them on 2/2/2026. Today, 2/16/2026, shortly after my post about my experience with them, they responded, as seen in the second image. Again, after that, they then sent my exact post back to me via email in the third image.

So, after my reddit post where I recounted *exactly* what happened from my perspective and from what Etsy support communicated to me, I have been threatened! Apparently I have been sending inappropriate messages from false accounts (I have not, unless the email with the same Etsy name counts as a false account, and if my email counted as inappropriate), and I am also getting sued for... What exactly? Reviewing a brand and explaining what happened and noting that the situation felt inconclusive and strange? That I labeled my experience with them as ""Weird""?

Their email sending my own reddit post back at me perfectly shows that their response stems only from seeing my review, and that they took great offense to it.

I've never had a brand threaten me because of a review, so this is a new experience for me. I would label it as *weird*, but that might get me another email from them about being a stalker bitch.

So, if anyone wants to get threatened by a brand, I highly recommend Chesilhurst Farm! 5/5 stars for the experience of threats from a scary Flight Attendant!

However, on a more genuine note, I did reach out to Etsy support about this new issue and they were very quick to take it seriously! They were very sweet and reassuring when I explained the situation to them and sent the emails their way, and jumped into action quickly. I'm hoping to get updates about that, and will likely edit my post or post a comment with more information on that when I get it.

So, has anyone else experienced threats from a brand after posting reviews on reddit? Was my email (And my reddit post) rude?

Also, hello Chesilhurst Farm! :))

Coffee shop napkins with her handwriting, “Thanks, enjoy!”,next to his name tag. Receipt from the library where she’d checked out the same book he had, two days later. The one from the corner market when she bought the exact brand of oat milk he preferred. Small things. Enough to make the quiet hours bearable.

He was thirty-four, still in the apartment his mother left him. No visitors. At the warranty call center he sat in a windowless cubicle, apologizing to strangers about broken appliances until the word dissolved. Coworkers passed with quick nods. He returned them silently.

Ava worked the evening shift at Brew & Bean. She never rushed him when he ordered the same large black every day. One Tuesday she looked up, really looked, and smiled. Not the customer-service smile. A real one, tired, like she’d had a long day too. “Rough one?” she asked. Tim froze. His tongue felt thick. “Yeah,” he managed. She nodded, handing him the cup. Their fingers didn’t touch. He wished they did.

That smile replayed for weeks. He started arriving earlier, lingering longer. Watching her wipe counters, laugh softly at a coworker’s joke. Once she caught his stare and gave a tiny wave. He left without his change.

The night he followed her home it rained. She walked fast under a cheap umbrella. He kept pace half a block back. When she turned into the alley behind her building he stepped closer. She didn’t hear him until the chloroform rag was already over her mouth. He whispered, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” while her body went soft.

In the basement he’d cleaned for months, he waited for her to wake. When she did, she coughed, eyes wide, wrists zip-tied.

“Where…?” Her voice cracked.

“Home,” Tim said. He sat on the floor a few feet away, knees drawn up. “Our home now.”

Ava tested the ties. “Please. I have a sister. She’ll look for me.”

“I know.” He smiled the way she’d smiled at him. “You smiled at me. At the shop. You said ‘Rough one?’ You saw me.”

Her breathing changed. “I say that to everyone.”

“No.” He shook his head. “Not like that. Not to me.”

She swallowed. “Untie me. We can talk. I’ll listen.”

“You already listened.” His voice stayed soft. “Every day. You took my order. You remembered oat milk. You smiled. That’s more than anyone ever did.”

Tears tracked down her face. “I’m scared.”

“I was scared too,” he said. “My whole life. People look through me. They forget I’m there. But you didn’t. So now you stay. You’ll be my wife. We’ll have quiet evenings. I’ll make tea. You won’t have to work anymore.”

She stared at him. “Please let me go.”

Upstairs the kettle whistled. He stood slowly. “I’ll bring you some. Chamomile. You like chamomile.”

It also compiles and updates the entire implementation plan with my amendments, even though I don't need the whole thing executed again.  
  
This inturn confuses me because when I come back after a coffee break and want to continue working on that task within the workspace, the titles changed, and I can't figure out what task the agent was primarily working on.

Does anyone find themselves falling into the same bottleneck here, or am I totally not using the agents manager and workspaces correctly?

1r6vcy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1r6vcy9/13_years_and_a_kid/,13 years and a kid,"13 years and a 10 year old kid. Yes, we had problems, yes, they were big ones, but we always checked in, “are you happy”, the answers always “so happy”, “this is where I belong”, “you are my one”, blah, blah, blah. 

For years, through fights, accomplishments, separations, and celebration, always promises of love and destiny. 

One day she comes home, I go to kiss her and she steps away. 

The romantic and intimate part of our relationship is done she says. There is no coming back. She wants to split finances. She wants to tell her parents. 

I’m on the kitchen floor. Dead. My future ripped away from me. My entire identity and lifestyle in pieces on the floor. She’s upstairs gaming. (With “Dave”, an old childhood friend she’s reconnected with…). 

After a week of moping around and being angry (not around the kid of course, he still has no idea), I decide I’m going to fight. 

I lay it out. We’ve had “talks” yes, but never the “I’m unhappy, this is why, if this doesn’t change, we’re done” talk. I give her a 1 year plan, full communication, therapy, self development, relationship development, check ins, the works. She takes it to read over. I have a chance. 

A week goes by, with only one mention about how serious I am. “I know. Thank you.” 

We talk. “I’m done” she says. She tells me about how from the beginning part of her felt we weren’t meant to be together, and that over the years we’ve grown more apart. She tells me that for the past few years she hasn’t felt in love with me, but was trying to make it work for our family. 

She tells me she’s been in love with “Dave” for 22 years. She tells me that when they reconnected she felt alive again. She tells me she “felt whole” when he said “when she was ready, he wanted to try being with her”. Blech.

She tells me they had reconnected before, soon after we broke up before a few years ago. That he broke up with his gf and was going to move back. Then suddenly his brother died, he stayed, and got back with his gf. 

Back to mine, is now out in the cold, so pairs up with one guy, and then slowly with me again (baby-daddy for the win). Soon it’s just me. Did you see what happened there. 

Jump back to now. Super sad panda looks out the window one day, as she is leaning in for a kiss. Oh. I confront her about it, she admits they are dating. It’s cool, I’m trying to be the better adult. It’s fine. 

In all this, our cat got sick and we had to put it down. Afterwards we got lunch, and decided to go to a hookah bar. She asks if he can meet us there. Better adult, better adult…suuure. 

It was, interesting. The way the interacted, even toned down for me..they were in it. She’s been going to hookah bars “for months” now..

I see how they interact. I see how their lives match up. I hear this person she’s become. 

I realize that during the day (she works in coffee) when I think she’s working or napping (she’s always tired, or needs to be alone), when I think she’s staying out with her DnD people, or her theater people, she’s with him. 

I realize she’s built a whole life aside from the home we’ve built. I encouraged her the whole time because DnD made her happy, because theater made her happy. 

I realized that not only was my future robbed from me, not only were my memories were now in question..but that by the time I was told what the new normal was, the new normal was already well in place. What they had going in was in full effect. It hadn’t been days, it hadn’t been weeks. It had been months. 

13 years and a kid, I was her “good enough”. 

13 years and a kid, her “what if” shows up and I’m tossed aside. 

So now what?

(Part 4)","A gentle breeze caressed my face waking me up, it was dark outside and my curtains danced in the wind tangled in moonlight. I rubbed my eyes trying to ground myself, I walked over to the window I didn’t remember opening and gripped the wooden frame pushing down forcefully. It glided along the track before stopping with a click, something had been placed in the track to make sure it couldn’t close accidentally. I pulled out the long pale stick that had be lodged in the frame, it was clubbed at one end but the other looked like it had been melted away with some kind of acid. I recoiled at the realization dropping the bone onto the floor and pausing for a moment when I realized the sound of it hitting the floor I had anticipated never came, I glanced down to see a shiny red surface that had now replaced my floor. I quickly realized that the room was shifting into a tunnel again and then came the sound again.

The sudden rush of air coming through the window was initiated by a thump, followed by ghastly groan and the air was expelled from the room through the window. This went on for a few beats before I realized exactly what was happening, it was breathing.

I jolted awake panting with sweat dripping from my brow, I turned to look at my phone realizing it was 3:50 AM. I landed back on my pillow trying to slow my breath and eventually drifted back to sleep.

This time the sunlight bathed my closed eyes its heat waking me up with a blinding glare. I looked over at my desk seeing my laptop still open with the email from “Mason” still staring at me from the screen. The truth was I didn’t want to respond, I wasn’t sure it was him anymore and even if it was something had changed and he wasn’t the same person I knew. I swung my legs from the bed and got dressed. 

Walking into the kitchen I was reminded of the events from last night, my dad and I fighting and my mom rushing in to swoop him away with a thunderous crack across the face, she was a badass. But seeing her now the woman from last night was nowhere to be found, she instead sat at the counter holding a coffee cup to her face and an untouched bagel placed in front of her, she looked like she hadn’t slept. Nevertheless he face mustered up the last ounce of energy it had to glow when she saw me.

“Good-morning sweetheart!” Her voice was soft and supple like a feather on my ear as I embraced her and she kissed my cheek.

“Morning Mom.” I kissed her forehead and went to exit the embrace but she was holding me in a way she hadn’t in a while. I felt her fingers press against my back and she was fighting my attempts to leave so I gave in and sat there for a minute just hugging my mom.

“What’re you up to today?” She asked after letting me go

I shrugged and glanced over to see that my dad must’ve still been in his office. Shadows danced across the gap under the door and I wondered if mom had kept him in there all night. I looked back at her and smiled before stepping out the back door and riding off down the driveway. 

I rode around the neighborhood for a while trying to find any other place to go, after that meeting at school I was scared to even look at the smoke stacks much less go to the baseball fields. Whoever didn’t want me there made their point loud and clear and I planned to abide by it.

Instead, nostalgia flooded me and I remembered riding by Masons house for the first time so that’s where I went. My bike jumped over the uneven pavement as I approached his house, the U-Haul that had inhabited the driveway was now gone and the house itself was sitting quietly on the street. I approached studying the navy blue curtains that now shielded the interior from the outside world, I caught a glimpse of movement on like someone was watching before my bike jolted to stop. I roses off the seat and lunged over the handlebars sticking my arms out to brace myself i felt my palms hit the pavement like a cheese grater catching the brunt of my fall before my forehead swiftly followed. I laid there for a moment feeling the cold pavement on my cheek where my mom had kissed it. The front door of the house swung open and woman with sun-kissed blonde hair leapt down the steps of the front porch in a what looked like pajamas and a robe that flew like a cape in the wind.

She ran up and scooped my face up into her hand,

“Oh dear are you alright? That was quite the tumble, let’s get you inside and patch you up.” Her voice soothed my now throbbing headache.

I tried to push myself up before being quickly reminded of my shredded palms, I winced in pain and she looped her arm through mine guiding me to my feet and ushering me into the house.

We stepped through the front door and I felt myself instinctively move towards the bathroom. I knew this house inside and out much to her surprise, I looked around through droplets of red that were now trickling down my forehead. The living room looked the same, like they hadn’t changed a thing and the same went for the kitchen I wondered to myself if they had changed anything at all. She stepped back and watched me make my way to the bathroom.

“Have a seat on the toilet and let me get the first aid kit.” She guided me to the seat and brushed her fingers against my forehead moving the hair to reveal my third eye for the next week or so, she frowned and walked out of the room only to return with a red case. As she popped it open and placed it on the counter my eyes drifted to the veiled movement behind her. A boy stood peering around the doorframe looking stunned at my bloodied face while rubbing tired eyes, I assumed he had woken up from the commotion and was surprised to find me sitting in his bathroom. Slowly recognition took over and I remembered the boy from school the other day, the boy from Connecticut, Jackson.

“Sam?” He questioned through a reluctant yawn.

“Yeah, Hi sorry for dropping by unannounced.” It felt like an odd time to be making jokes when I looked how I did.

The woman who I assumed correctly was his mom glanced back to see him standing and her demeanor shifted immediately. She turned away from me but I could still catch a glimpse of her in the bathroom mirror as she snarled at him.

“Jackson honey, lets grab Sam’s bike from the front lawn and make sure its not broken alright? And grab a wash cloth while you’re up.” Her voice pried at gritted teeth and her eyes bulged at him. He nodded defeated and moments later arrived with a washcloth before heading outside to collect my bike. If he didn’t already, i was sure he hated me now.

His mother drowned the washcloth before dabbing it on my forehead trying to retrieve tiny pebbles that had lodged their way into my skin.

“Where were you headed honey? Can I call someone to come get you? Maybe your parents?” She asked with an edge in her voice, digging surgically for something.

“No no really it’s okay, I just live around the corner and was on my way home but thank you.” I quickly responded hoping to avoid any further investigating.

She smiled now focusing on my chiseled hands, I tried not to panic this was the first chance I had to actually look at them. My left palm was a flap of skin that had bunched up like a sheet and my right had a cut straight down the middle with thin surface level gashes surrounding it. I looked up at her and she read my face.

“Don’t worry, it’ll be quick.” As she unfolded my palm and started to wrap both hands up with gauze.

She said I was more than welcome to wait until I felt ready to leave on my own or they could walk me home just to be safe, realizing she wouldn’t be easy to dodge I agreed to wait an hour or so until she seemed confident in my ability to walk without leaning or toppling over.

Jackson came back inside and we disappeared to his room. It all felt so strange I actually almost calling his mom Mrs. Elliot but caught myself.

I stopped in the threshold of his room and looked around feeling dizzy from the resemblance it had to Mason’s room or it could have been the pain meds for my head. Everything looked the same, the furniture sat in the same spot like everything was left exactly the same all they changed were pictures and books on the shelves. I couldn’t stay here.

Jackson looked at me seeing my hesitation to enter,

“Sam do you know who used to live here before us?” He walked over to his desk and reached underneath prying something loose from the underside of it. He held a white envelope and Polaroid in his hands. 

My stomach dropped and my head started to throb i could feel the blood rushing to my head and was sure it start to see droplets trickle across my vision again.

“I- Yeah, yeah I knew the family that lived here before you.” My voice broke and the words barely fluttered out of my mouth.

“I found this tucked into the vent in the closet when we moved in. I don’t know why I held onto it but then I met you at school and realized it wasn’t for me.” He extended a hand with the envelope and Polaroid, which I cupped my hands together to grasp gently. I tossed the Polaroid over in my fingers to see Mason and I standing shoulder to shoulder with our classmate at the football game. 

I looked up at Jackson with tears forming in my eyes.

“Where did you get this?” I lowered my voice to a whisper but it cracked as tears started to stream down my face making a popping sound as they hit the picture.

“Like I said Sam, I just found them when we moved in.“ His voiced was sturdy like these were lines he had been forced to rehearse, his eyes though screamed of desperation like he was finally letting go of a curse. His voice softened to meet mine.

“Please take these Sam.”

I reached out and grabbed him pulling him in close, I didn’t know Jackson or who he was as a person but in that moment I didn’t need to.

“Thank you.”

After a moment I let go and walked out of the room making my way to the back door. I stopped to call out to his mom to thank her but got no response, I slid open the glass and walked along the deck to the garage where my bike was propped up against the big two car garage door. Next to it sat a smaller door with cardboard covering the glass, I paused and placed a hand on the handle letting curiosity guide me. I caught the handle with my palm and recoiled in pain as the door flew open, a man towered over me making his way out of the garage he smiled wide and his eyes were bloodshot like he hadn't seen the backs of his eye lids in day. 

“Well hey there Sammy, it’s nice to meet you. How’s the head?” He shot his had out grabbing mine and gripping it firmly, I felt the warm liquid start to ooze from my bandages and my throat tightened to prevent from screaming in pain. 

“It’s alright, please thank your wife for me I couldn’t find her in the house.” I used a built up bundle of gasps to power through the sentence.

“Of course! We have to look out for our community here isn’t that right?” His smile faded at the end of his sentence and he still had hold of my hand which was now dripping onto his driveway. 

“Oh my! So sorry there champ.” He looked down at the pond that was forming and retracted his grip, he reached for a rag from his back pocket and dabbed at his hand that was now stained bright red mixed with a darker older red that wasn’t mine. I looked intently at his hands and behind him at the garage door, I thanked his wife in my mind with a shiver and grabbed my bike to head home.

The ride home was should’ve been short but holding the handle bars was a luxury that I had come to miss dearly. Pulling into the driveway I passed both my parents cars but upon entering my house there was no one to be found, they probably ran to a neighbors house or something so I fixed myself something to eat and went to my room.

I was greeted by my open laptop glowing with Masons email dancing across my screen. I didn’t know how to respond or if I even wanted to. I picked the photo and envelope from my back pocket and placed them on the desk, the envelope wasn’t sealed but looked like it had been at one point. The photo was a welcome memory in a hazed reality, I placed it on my laptop as another message came through.

From: Mason

Hey Sam, I didn’t get a response from you in my last email. How are things? I just wanted to check on you. - Mason

The chime rang in my ears like a balloon had popped and all that was left was the constant and brutal ringing, I sat down preparing to form a hesitant response when another chime come through the speakers and I pulled my fingers from the keyboard, no response would be needed anymore.

From: Mason

Are you ignoring me Samuel.

I felt my eyes start to strain and the pounding headache started up again, my mind started to fracture glancing back and forth from the words to the picture. Another chime.

From: Mason

You are close Samuel, searching searching.

My mind called everyone a suspect, was it Jackson? His parents? After all he had the letter and was insistent that I take it. I thought to my parents, dad was always locked in that office always removed preoccupied with his work on his laptop. Then I thought back to the meeting at school the other day, the disfigured man. He hadnt been in there long but it was long enough to show that everyone listened to him, no one spoke against him, he was the kind of man you’d step aside for without knowing why, a man of power.

A final chime.

From: M850n

So0n S4mu3l, w3 wi1l 5ee y0u so n.

I slammed my laptop shut and grabbed it tossing it gently under the bed, it had to be a virus or something that had gotten on my laptop. I climbed into bed and shut my eyes drifting off from the pain meds. My body had drifted off and I wasn’t sure how long it had been but my mind felt awake, I could hear distant whispers echoing from somewhere in my house.

“It’s almost in the next phase, this takes time.”

“Remember your promise, remember what we did to get here.”

“He’s theirs now.”

The voices sounded familiar and like they were fighting each other, one was male and was very assertive while the other was softer and felt warmer.

“He’s my son.”

“I want to take it back.”

“You did this to us, you-“

I felt warm liquid running down my face and was sure my head was bleeding again but I couldn’t move, my fingers twitched and my closed eyes darted back and forth trying to open. I tried to fight but I fell back into a dream. 

The street lights glowed above as I passed in and out of shadows, I felt my legs pushing down on the pedals of my bike like pushing through molasses every ounce of energy was being drained from me. I remember a pulling sensation in my chest something drawing me closer to it like an internal compass, a recognition. The night was quiet, no birds or crickets filling the ambient air with their songs just pure silence. I passed under the archway and made my way past the baseball diamond and up to the chain fence. I grabbed hold of it with my wrapped hands but felt no pain coursing through them, I wanted to climb over to go in. The door felt like it was staring at me trying to entice me into opening it but I couldn’t, not yet. I felt a sharp pain in my head and a thumping started, my headache was rearing its head in full force even in my dream. I grabbed at my ears but the thumping came from something else, I could feel it vibrating through me. I let backed away from the fence and landed in the grass laying on my back I felt the blades prick at my skin, trying to break its way inside. The sound became rhythmic again like a muffled kick drum and then came the breeze, in and out, in and out. I stared up into the night sky following the two pillars as they climbed until the tops were in focus. Puffs of white bellowed from the tops being pulled in just as quick as it was pushed out trying to escape.

The vibrating of my phone ripped me from my dream. It was 3:52 AM, and I had a text message.

M850n: U f0und m3.

1r6v90c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menscomeback/comments/1r6v90c/the_psychology_of_feeling_lost_why_everyones/,# The Psychology of Feeling Lost: Why Everyone's Faking It (Science-Based Solutions),"Okay, real talk. I've spent way too much time researching this because I kept seeing people around me who seemed totally fine while I was spiraling. And honestly? Most people feel this way but nobody talks about it. It's like we're all pretending we have our shit together when really we're all just winging it.

I've gone deep into books, podcasts, research papers, all that stuff. Not because I'm some expert, but because I was tired of feeling like I was the only one drowning while everyone else was swimming. Turns out, feeling lost isn't a personal failure. It's actually pretty normal, especially in your 20s and 30s. Society makes us think we should have everything figured out by 25, which is absolute bullshit.

Here's what actually helped:

**Stop comparing your behind-the-scenes to everyone's highlight reel**

Social media is basically everyone's best moments on repeat. You're seeing their vacation photos, not their 3am anxiety attacks. The comparison game will destroy you. I started unfollowing accounts that made me feel like shit and my mental health improved dramatically. Instead, follow stuff that actually adds value to your life.

**Build a routine that grounds you**

When everything feels chaotic, having a few consistent things each day helps anchor you. Even small stuff like making your bed, morning coffee ritual, or a 10 minute walk. The app Finch is actually great for this. It's a self care app with a little bird that grows as you complete habits. Sounds childish but it genuinely works. The gamification aspect tricks your brain into building consistency without feeling like you're forcing it. Plus the bird is cute as hell and sends you encouraging messages.

**Accept that feeling lost is part of the process**

This sounds like fortune cookie advice but hear me out. In [The Midnight Library](https://a.co/d/0aHOqSg7) by Matt Haig (bestselling author who writes beautifully about mental health and regret), the main character gets to explore all her alternate lives. She realizes that every path has its struggles, and there's no perfect choice. The book will make you question everything you think you know about success and happiness. Insanely good read. It helped me understand that feeling uncertain doesn't mean you're failing, it means you're human and growing.

**Connect with people, even when you don't want to**

Isolation makes everything worse. Your brain lies to you and says everyone hates you or you're bothering them. That's depression talking. Text someone. Join a group. Go to that thing you've been avoiding. Loneliness literally impacts your health the same way smoking does, according to research from Brigham Young University.

The app Wisdo is useful here. It connects you with people going through similar struggles. Not therapy, just peer support. You can join communities for loneliness, quarter life crisis, whatever. Sometimes just knowing other people feel the same way helps.

**Figure out your values, not your goals**

Goals change constantly. Values stay consistent. Instead of stressing about where you should be career wise or relationship wise, think about what actually matters to you. Connection? Creativity? Freedom? Growth? When you align your daily life with your values instead of chasing arbitrary milestones, things feel less aimless.

There's a great episode on this from the podcast [We Can Do Hard Things with Glennon Doyle](https://wecandohardthingspodcast.com/). She talks about how we're taught to climb ladders without checking if they're leaning against the right wall. Really shifts your perspective on what success means.

**Read Lost Connections by Johann Hari**

This book changed how I understand loneliness and depression. Hari is an award winning journalist who spent years researching why depression and anxiety are skyrocketing. Spoiler, it's not just a chemical imbalance. It's disconnection from meaningful work, from other people, from nature, from values. He interviews researchers and experts across the world. Best book on mental health I've ever read, hands down. It explains why you feel this way and gives actual practical solutions.

[BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alumni that turns research papers, expert interviews, and books into personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans based on your specific goals. Type in something like ""I want to understand why I feel disconnected"" and it pulls from psychology research and expert talks to create customized podcasts, anywhere from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are actually addictive, you can pick anything from a calm bedtime narrator to something more energetic for morning commutes. What stands out is the structured learning plan it builds around what kind of person you want to become, not just random book summaries. Worth checking out if you're trying to replace doomscrolling with something that actually helps.

**Do literally anything creative**

Doesn't matter if you're good at it. Paint, write, cook, build something, learn guitar. When you're lost, creating something tangible gives you proof that you can still make things happen. It sounds stupid until you try it. There's research showing that creative activities reduce cortisol and improve mood significantly.

**Remember this is temporary**

You won't feel this way forever. Your brain is bad at remembering that when you're in the thick of it, but it's true. Things shift. You'll look back on this period and it'll feel like a weird dream. That doesn't make it easier right now, but it's worth remembering.

The feeling of being lost isn't a sign you're broken. Sometimes it means you're between chapters. Sometimes it means you're outgrowing old versions of yourself. Sometimes it just means you're human and life is complicated and messy for everyone, despite what their Instagram makes it look like.

1r6v4lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1r6v4lb/found_a_partner_and_deleted_the_apps_heres_what/,Found a partner and deleted the apps - here's what it took,"I started my dating journey last year - I'm a 43m, bald, OK shape, decent looking, middle income guy with 50/50 of two kids. 

I began dating last March, a year after my ex and I separated and once my divorce finalized.  Here is what I went through:

**March-April** \- got acquainted with apps.  I had a few likes - mostly women up to 10 years older than me, which which was fine, but no real connections in the chats.

Matched with 2 women that I thought I'd like to date, but one lived far enough away that she said us both having kids would make it tough, which was correct.

Matched with another woman about my age, no kids, but lived even further away.  So after some chats, I told her she was great, but I should have paid more careful attention to how far away people were.

**Late April:**  Was super-swiped by a woman I ended up liking alot, about 6 years older, no kids, lived about 1.5 hours away.   We dated, instant connection, lovely woman, very intelligent, looked 15 years younger than she was.  Several niche hobbies in common, common sensibilities, physical attraction, etc. I paused the apps after our first date, where we met up.  The second date, she brought a picnic to my town of food that she made and swept me of my feet.  Based on the way she phrased things, she was very a much a one person at a time kind of woman.  I am that way too.  I found out that was NOT the case for her as I found several grub hub order tickets on drink cups with the name of who she said was the last guy she had dated.  One item dated the morning of the day we got together.  I brought up the idea of exclusivity and to her credit, she said she wasn't ready to be exclusive at the 3-4 month mark, but said she hadn't even been on the apps since we connected.  I brought up the cups and she wasn't defensive but was a bit caught off guard.  I told her I valued my time with her, but after coming off a marriage with (not my) infidelity, I had mixed feelings on the impressions she gave of her being exclusive versus her actions.  I learned that you have to declare exclusivity, and you simply cannot just assume it.  That ended in July.

**July-August** \- did a lot of swiping on bumble and hinge.  Suffered from a ""scarcity"" mindset after ending that brief relationship.  Had a lot of women that I thought would make great matches, but almost nothing back.  It was disheartening.  I stayed more local this time, as dating someone 1.5 hrs away was taxing.

**August** \- Went on a coffee date with a local women, 3 years younger.  Was very funny and smart, but there was no physical attraction.  I let her know that I enjoyed the date, but that I didn't feel a romantic connection the next day via text, wished her the best.

**August** \- Matched with another local woman, about my age, and same situation as above.  Very nice, very intelligent, but I didn't see any physical chemistry on my end.

**Late August** \- I was swiped by a woman a little over an hour away, same age as me, one kid.  Beautiful, with a really sweet smile.  The conversation was kind of slow at first - she was consistent in texting me, but didn't say too much or ask too many questions back.  I had a few chats like that where a woman was texting too many guys, or wasn't terribly interested.  Given that and the distance, I almost unmatched.  But rather than withdrawing, I went ahead and asked her if she wanted to meet up for coffee or a drink and she said yes - sudden tone change.  We found a Saturday and met at a bar halfway between.  We ended up talking for like 5 hours that night, we had a lot in common, made each other laugh, and were excited for the next date.

By the 4th date, she told me that she wanted me to know that she wasn't seeing anyone else, and didn't expect me to say the same, but just wanted me to know.  I told her I was the same.  Before things got too physical, we both agreed to STD tests and to show each other.

From there, we managed to see each other 2-4 times every 2 weeks and have grown into a wonderful relationship.  In January, despite not using them since our first date, we agreed to delete the apps together.  We had a great Valentines day, and we're both over the moon for each other.  We've taken a few weekend trips and have a big one planned.  We both have taken some time each month to talk about various topics, like what we are looking for in a partner, in our dating, and various check-ins.  Those check-ins have been wonderful.

She said that in her OLD journey, to keep herself sane, she would allow herself **five** swipes per day (either left or right) and went on a lot of first dates and had given up on OLD a few times.  She first started OLD 1.5 years ago and had one dating partner for a few months who ended up having SEVERAL girlfriends.  Both our marriages ended because of the other partner's infidelity, and we both did a lot of healing through therapy, self-care, and time.  She said what made my profile stand out was that I wasn't holding a fish that I caught, and I was modest in my profile - I didn't claim to be a super world-savvy master-of-all-trades kind of person.  I didn't claim that I was taller than I was (she noted later that she didn't have a big height preference, but was constantly amazed by men overshooting their heights by 3+ inches), and that I included some photos that weren't super flattering, but just plain life moments, including one where I looked tired.  She said it was refreshing after so many painstakingly curated profiles to find someone who, while giving a fuck, wasn't trying to maximize themselves relentlessly.  Like, she didn't have to do too much work on the first date to figure out where the reality of the profile ended and the real person started.

  
I feel like I lucked out finding her - like the universe sent her to me.  But I also know that my perseverance was what mattered in the end.  I had a LOT of unreciprocated swipes and read many horror stories on reddit.  I wasn't any good at talking to women in person the few times I tried (bars and social events).  But I plugged away and found a gentle soul that I am crazy about - maybe had an easier time than most.  Even if she were to end it tomorrow all of the sudden, I think I would walk away, despite the hurt, understanding exactly how I want to feel and be treated in a relationship, and be ready to accept nothing less than what I want, and be OK if I didn't kill it on the apps.

  
Good luck, keep at it.",4,1771298956.0,Bumble,2,1.0,False

My name is Ker. I’m 25F from Panama, and lately I’ve been feeling pretty lonely so I’m trying something different by posting here.

My everyday hobbies are pretty simple: I like making coffee (especially iced coffee), cooking when I’m in the mood, relaxing with a good book, watching anime or movies, and spending quiet time at home with my pets.

I’m calm, a bit nerdy, and more “steady connection” than “sparkly chaos” I’m warm once I trust you, and I really value peace, consistency, and easy conversation.

I’m looking for a connection that feels light and easy, but also stable the kind where we talk consistently, enjoy each other’s company, and don’t add stress to each other’s lives. If we build enough trust, I’d love to do calls sometimes: watching movies together, sharing random thoughts, and maybe gaming if that’s your thing. I hope you can stand my neutral mixed with latino accent. 

Small warning: I’m slow at multiplayer games. Like… even in Stardew Valley 😭 So if you’re patient and can laugh about it with me instead of getting frustrated, we’ll get along.

✨ A bit about me: 

\- I’m more of an introvert and I prefer calm environments over loud social scenes.

\- I love reading, and I’m into anime and movies (especially drama / coming-of-age / psychological horror).

\- I enjoy writing and I like deep conversations, but I also appreciate comfortable silence.

\- I’m working on my future seriously. I’m finishing my major, soon to be working and building my plans step by step, even if it takes time.

\- I’m loyal when I feel safe, and I genuinely like being someone’s peaceful place.

\- If you're curious about my appearance, I'm 5'6 and I'll be honest that I'm chubby. It's something that I know that I need to working on but if this is not your type, I'd appreciate that you just pass on. In my profile, there are some pics of me. 

✨  What I’m looking for: 

I want someone who brings tranquility and peace into my life and I promise to offer the same. I’d like us to support each other, be kind, and keep things emotionally stable. If there’s real chemistry, I’m open to the idea of meeting someday  but I want to be realistic: I can’t do that immediately because I have plans I’m working through first. If you want to take a little trip to here, that's okay but also there's no pressure. 

Also being transparent: one of my long-term goals is to emigrate and build a better life somewhere else. But I’m not looking for someone to “give me a passport.” I want to achieve my goals on my own, through my studies and my own effort. What I want right now is simply a steady, calm companionship.

✨ Preferences (to avoid wasting your time)

Age range: 22 to 40 (outside that range, it’s unlikely I’ll feel connected).

Location/time zones: I don’t like excluding people, but realistically I connect best with Latin America, North America, and maybe Europe if you’re able to talk at afternoon or night (my time). Because of time differences, it’s hard for me to build something with Asia/Oceania.

Effort matters: I’ll prioritize personalized intros (not obvious copy-paste templates and obvious AI generic introductions). To help you in your introduction, what if you tell me your favorite movie and/or anime and why :) 

Account history: the more history your account has, the better.

✨ Attraction / vibe

Height isn’t a dealbreaker for me at all. I’m used to being around shorter guys. What I notice more is a guy’s eyes (expressive looks get me) and overall charisma + humbleness. 

🔎 What I think I’m truly trying to find 

I think what I want is:

\- A person who feels like safe emotional “home”, not a rollercoaster 

\- Someone consistent: not perfect, just reliable and communicative

\- A bond where we can be cute and playful, but also respect each other’s space

\- A connection that grows naturally no rushing and pressure but still real

✅ What you’d get with me (the “pros”)

\- A partner who genuinely values peace, loyalty, and emotional stability

\- Someone who will listen, be supportive, and try to be your calm place too

\- A connection built on patience, respect, and consistency

\- Cozy calls, shared routines, movie hours, and a soft kind of companionship

\- A person who’s serious about building her life and won’t treat you as a tool for her goals

If you read all of this, thanks seriously. I hope the right person finds this. And if not, I still genuinely wish you a good day/night and that you find the connection you’re looking for too.

1r6v0oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Regrets/comments/1r6v0oi/i_regret_staying_for_so_long/,I regret staying for so long,"I started dating my first boyfriend when I was 14 and he was 16. It was the first time I felt seen and wanted.. but boy oh boy were there so many problems. He had a lot of home problems and several mental disorders (some we didn’t know about till a few years ago) ADHD, OCD, PTSD, Anxiety, Severe depressive disorder, Autism, AND he had kallmann syndrome (he couldn’t produce his own testosterone, so he had to give himself shots) I stayed with him for 9 years despite how miserable I was. 

Almost immediately after we started dating he started playing the pity card and me being the people pleaser that I was I did everything I could to try and make him happy. I spent so many nights sitting on the phone with him while he had panic attacks, begging my parents to take me to his place when he was going through a depressive episode, even ignoring my friends so I could text him as he’d get upset if I wasn’t at his beck and call. It was like if I didn’t constantly message him or see him he was going to kill himself.. I was so worried he was going to hurt himself because I wasn’t giving him my attention. 

We would constantly argue and he eventually pulled me into his depressive hole, I was self harming just to dull the emotional toll he put me through everyday. I feel like staying with him prevented me from seeing my full potential.. I was taking all AP classes, I was doing crew, I had a job.. but I was never doing anything to the best of my abilities because I was constantly emotionally exhausted and soon became reclusive. 

Eventually I left for college and he would get upset when I went out with the new friends I made because he was worried I’d get assault or whatever dumb reason he came up with to prevent me from having fun. I was in school to become a teacher but halfway through my freshman year Covid hit and I had to move back home where he was. I felt lost and so unsure of myself and he didn’t help my case. 

I tried to move to the beach with my friend that summer so I could live and work there but he guilted me out of it so I could stay closer to him. I felt lost in college and he offered no support. I got addicted to getting high off weed everyday to fill the void. 

I paid all of the bills when I was in college and he mooched off of me. I was a full time student and I was employed, working till 3am most nights. He was in and out of work wasting money and I let him. 

Eventually I graduated with a BA in history and I so regret not getting my teaching degree. I’d be double majored in history and secondary education and I would’ve had a Masters in 5 years but I stopped my junior year because of how drained I was.

Eventually we moved to a new state with my friends and soon after my friends started seeing how much he was hurting me. They finally told me something I needed to hear after all this time.. “he doesn’t respect you and he never has” 

A little insight as to how manipulative he was, when I did break things off with him, he tracked my sister location when she was visiting me in town (I tried to remain friends with him since we were engaged at one point and together for 9 years) and when he saw we were out with my other friends at a restaurant he got upset. We went to bed before he got home from work because we didn’t want to deal with him. For the next two hours he was banging his head on the coffee table demanding attention. Tbh idk how much my brain has blocked out from my relationship with him but I feel like he set me back so much. 

I’m dating a new guy and he has so much drive, he’s extremely smart, able to take care of himself, stable. He tells me stories about high school and college and how he became so successful. All the while my teenage and early 20s were spent trying to fix a man who never wanted to be fixed. I wasted 9 years, never putting myself first and I think it set me back so much.

Before my trip to Central Europe I had bought all of my train tickets I had timed all of my museum visits and even made a color-coded spreadsheet. As soon as I got to Central Europe I realized that looking at a city from a window or going on a guided tour is not really the same, as actually seeing the city.

By the end of the day, I stopped following the schedule completely. I went to a park in the afternoon and walked around. I saw families giving food to the swans and old men playing chess on tables made of stone. Then I talked to a student from the area. The student told me that if I really wanted to tour the area, I had to rent a Poland Bike and go to the river district where the artists live. I pedaled for four hours without a map, only stopping for coffee whenever I saw a shop that looked cozy. I took photos of street art that I found along the way. I never would have seen that street art if I had a map and a plan so it was really cool that I got to discover it by chance.

I’ve tried to find some of those unique, locally-made accessories I saw on the commuters there, specifically some leather panniers that looked incredible, but looking on Etsy and Alibaba was a total dead end. It just showed me that you can't just buy culture online, you have to go out and experience it for yourself.",1,1771298385.0,TravelStories,0,1.0,False

I've been happily consuming monk fruit and stevia sweeteners thinking it is absolutely safe but to my dissapointment they contain 99% erythritol which is a sugar alcohol infamous for gut reaction and blood clotting. i was constantly sitting in the bathroom after the third coffee or tea with those sugar replacements only to realise later that they are heavy on sugar alcohols which are pathetic for digestion. diarrhoea maxx. I have felt the same with the cost effective Amul protein shakes only to realise that they have maltitol (another sugar alcohol). 

  
I've read a lot about allulose and I've been talking about it with friends ( I had bought it first in japan last year). delighted that it is out there.

Here's the description: 

**He used to liquidate companies. Now, he’s liquidating heroes.**

Arthur Penhaligon was the ultimate corporate shark—a middle manager with a heart of stone and a spreadsheet for a soul. But after a lifetime of downsizing others, he finds himself on the receiving end of a ""terminal"" performance review.

Instead of the afterlife, Arthur is headhunted by **Dungeon Inc.**, a multidimensional conglomerate that treats fantasy realms like underperforming branch offices. His new assignment? **IronCrag Dungeon.**

It’s a logistical nightmare. The goblins are quiet-quitting, the skeletons are over-budget, and the previous Dark Lord was a creative type who didn't understand the first thing about overhead. Even worse, a party of ""Heroic"" adventurers is currently knocking on the front door, looking to loot the very assets Arthur was hired to protect.

**Arthur isn't a warrior. He isn't a wizard. But he has something far more dangerous: an MBA.**

To survive his probationary period, Arthur must:

* **Optimize the Workforce:** Turn a rabble of lazy monsters into a lean, mean, professional fighting machine.
* **Balance the Books:** Every fireball costs mana, and every mana point has a price tag.
* **Leverage the Environment:** Why fight a hero with a sword when you can defeat them with a strategically placed, high-ROI spike trap?

In the world of Dungeon Inc., there are no chosen ones—only high-performers. And Arthur Penhaligon is about to show the Kingdom of Light that the most terrifying thing in any dungeon isn't a dragon... it’s a manager who hasn't had his coffee yet.

**Why readers are obsessed with Dungeon Inc.:**

* **The Ultimate Satire:** A hilarious, razor-sharp parody of corporate culture set in a high-stakes LitRPG world.
* **Progression with a Twist:** Watch Arthur ""level up"" not just his stats, but his profit margins and infrastructure.
* **Unforgettable Characters:** Featuring Snivels the neurotic Executive Assistant goblin and Gorash the Chief Security Officer Minotaur.
* **Crunchy Stats:** Includes detailed ledger entries, workforce analytics, and dungeon management screens.

**Perfect for fans of** ***Dungeon Crawler Carl*****,** ***Legend of the Arch Magus*****, and anyone who has ever wanted to fire a Paladin for a breach of contract.**

1r6uukg,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1r6uukg/trip_report_1_month_in_quito_ecuador/,Trip Report: 1 month in Quito Ecuador,"I took this trip a few months ago, but I wasn't on Reddit then so sharing my experience now! Hopefully it can help people decide if Quito is a good destination for them.

**TL;DR:** Overall good experience, although Quito may not offer what many digital nomads are looking for. If you're looking for a fast-paced, walkable metropolis with a strong DN scene, Quito might not be the right city for you. If you're looking for a cheap-ish, low-key city with lots of nature and culture to explore, then you might consider Quito.

**Arrival:** Pretty straightforward. If you're flying from the US, there are direct flights from major airports like LA, Houston, and Miami. In Latin America, there are flights to Quito from Panama City, San Jose, and Bogota to name a few. Right now there are no direct flights to Ecuador from Brazil or Mexico.

Quito's airport is really nice. It's not huge, but it's very modern, clean, and easy to navigate. It's located in the outskirts of the city, and can take between 45 and 60 minutes to get to the actual city by car (less if there's no traffic). If your flight arrives in the evening (which is common for international flights), there are several hotels near the airport with shuttle service if you want to spend your first night there. Immigration was easy and customs speaks English. There are bathrooms both before and after customs; the ones before are kind of hidden, but if you walk around or ask for help you'll find them.

**Neighborhoods:** I stayed in two different areas: Gonzalez Suarez and La Floresta. My thoughts:

1. Gonzalez Suarez: upscale neighborhood. One of safest areas in the city. One of the only parts of Quito with tall buildings so it stands out. Good amount of restaurants and coffee shops nearby, as well as small grocery stores and pharmacies. A few hotels here and there but mostly Airbnbs for accommodation. If you do stay here, I'd recommend picking a place located directly on Gonzalez Suarez avenue. The side streets heading west are also nice, but they're VERY hilly (think San Francisco but worse). Meanwhile, Gonzalez Suarez avenue is nice and flat. Fankor is a famous coffee shop to work from (saw a few other DNs here), but I personally found it too loud to work, plus the wifi was very slow. Just down the street was another place called Coffee Relief which was quieter and had great wifi. While I'd stay in this area again, it did feel a little soulless compared to the rest of the city.
2. La Floresta: artistic/hipster neighborhood. Felt pretty safe overall during the day, but slightly less so than Gonzalez Suarez. A few locals here advised me to be careful, to avoid going out at night, etc. Followed this advice and didn't have any bad experiences. Beautiful tree-lined streets with murals. More tranquil than Gonzalez Suarez, but not necessarily ""quiet"" (more on that below). Not a big neighborhood but there are some cool shops, restaurants, and cafes to explore. Ocho y Medio is a unique cafe/restaurant/movie theater that's worth visiting (I think it has wifi as well for working). It felt more charming and ""real"" compared to Gonzalez Suarez, which I liked. There are some hotels located on the periphery, but if you want to stay directly inside La Floresta I think Airbnb will be your best choice. I'd stay in this area again, though the safety of the neighborhood is something to keep in mind.

(honorary mention: while I didn't stay here, I was pretty impressed by the neighborhood directly east of Carolina park, which is the city's financial hub. Tall modern buildings, very walkable, and it actually felt safe to walk around in the evening (not recommended for other neighborhoods in Quito). There was a decent number of people out and about at 10 PM on a weekday. Great Italian food spots as well! Plus the view of the park and the mountains is great, and you're by a metro stop. Honestly, if I go back to Quito I'd probably stay here.)

**Accommodations:**

* Airbnb: you can get a nice, modern Airbnb in the neighborhoods listed above for $40 to $80 USD per night. Note that many residential buildings have strict rules against having guests over (including during the day). Both the Airbnbs I stayed at had extremely fast and reliable wifi; definitely something to ask the host about before booking though, just to be safe. I'd recommend trying to stay in a modern highrise if possible. The two places I stayed at were in slightly older buildings, and had very thin windows. There's a lot of street noise in Quito (comparable to other LATAM cities but loud compared to US cities). I was wearing my headphones all day just trying to concentrate. I'd imagine that the highrises have thicker windows, but don't be afraid to check with the host.
* Hotels: international brands like Marriott and Hilton have prices comparable to the US. Smaller local hotels run cheaper.
* Coliving spaces: from what I can tell, there are only a couple coliving spaces in Quito (Playhouse Quito in La Floresta, and Coliving Home in Mariscal Sucre). Both of them have positive reviews, so worth checking out if you're staying long-term.

**Things I enjoyed:**

* **Mountains:** If you're a fan of mountains, Quito is extraordinary. It sits in a valley between two large mountains and the city has crazy hills as a result. Lots of hiking opportunities for all skill levels within relatively close driving distance.
* **Weather:** A tad chilly but very mild and pleasant overall. Similar to early fall/late spring weather in the US (but drier).
* **People:** Very friendly people. Not super outgoing like in coastal LATAM, but warm. Locals are curious and happy to talk to foreigners. Very proud of their culture.
* **Culture:** Interesting blend of indigenous, Spanish colonial, and modern. The historic city center is fascinating and beautiful (take the metro to get there!). Lots of museums throughout the city to explore.
* **Proximity to cool spots:** Many great day trip/weekend trip opportunities from Quito. Papallacta for hot springs, Mindo and Banos for outdoor activities in the jungle, Cotopaxi for hiking, Otavalo for indigenous art and goods. Short flights to Cuenca and the Galapagos.
* **Not overly touristy:** Ecuador gets way fewer tourists compared to Colombia, Peru, etc. Tourist attractions are lively but not crowded, which is nice.

**Things I disliked:**

* **Delivery apps:** Not sure why but I struggled to use local apps for food/grocery delivery (tried Rappi and PedidosYa). The apps were pretty buggy when it came to choosing the delivery address and adding a credit card. No matter which credit card I tried though, I'd always get an error saying my card couldn't be used. No security notification from the bank. In the end I just used Uber Eats, which works in Quito for food and groceries (as well as rides) and didn't have any payment issues. Later on I discovered that Rappi and PedidosYa have an option where you pay the delivery person in cash, so I ended up using that a few times. Still not sure why my cards never worked, was unexpected and kind of frustrating.
* **Noise:** As mentioned above, Quito is a loud city coming from the US. Car horns, dogs barking, and the gas truck (iykyk) all day. Earplugs and noise cancelling headphones will be your friends, though a place with thick windows should be enough to handle most of the noise. I did feel like I was starting to get used to it by the end.
* **Limited nightlife:** While restaurants and bars stay open into the night, the city does seem to empty out as soon as the sun goes down. Almost nothing stays open 24 hours (aside from convenience stores in gas stations). It's eerily quiet at night.

**Things I didn't mind but other people may dislike:**

* **Cost:** I'm pretty sure Quito is cheaper than Medellin/Bogota/Lima, but certain things might seem expensive. Coffee and meals at nicer places were similar in price to the US. Groceries were cheaper though, especially produce.
* **Language Barrier:** English isn't widely spoken, including in hotels and restaurants. Would recommend learning basic Spanish phrases and keeping a translator app handy. Ecuadorian Spanish (especially around Quito) is one of the easier accents to understand for beginners.
* **Not the best food scene:** It's gotten better over the years, but in general Quito's food scene (especially international food) is lacking. There are some amazing chefs who are innovating with Ecuadorian food, but these places can be pricey. I find standard Ecuadorian food to be tasty (if repetitive), but it's arguably a step below Mexican/Peruvian food. While you can find things like sushi, pizza, Korean food, etc. in Quito, it can be pretty hit or miss. I had both amazing and terrible Italian food, ok Chinese food, ok Peruvian food, ok Japanese food, and bad Mexican food. The best meals I had were at Ecuadorian restaurants.
* **Not a DN hub:** Quito doesn't have a strong DN scene like Medellin or Mexico City. There aren't many coworking spaces, spacious cafes to work from, or coliving spaces. I didn't run into many foreigners in Quito in general, besides the touristy areas. Aside from the coliving spaces mentioned above, you'd probably have to make an effort to meet other digital nomads.
* **Safety:** Ecuador has been in the news lately due to safety concerns, but Quito (and most of the central mountain region) hasn't been affected in the way that the coastal regions have. At no point during my trip did I feel unsafe or in danger. I'd recommend asking locals for safety tips, rather than tourists, and always following them. I wouldn't recommend walking around the city with a laptop, or anything else expensive, in your backpack (unless it's a very short walk). FWIW the new Quito metro felt safer than some American metros I've taken. While the safety precautions didn't bother me too much, I could see how some DNs might not like this.
* **Lack of development:** Quito has more modern development than La Paz, but less than Medellin. For a long time the city couldn't build high rises due to the location of the old airport. Now that the new airport is open, Quito is slowly adding taller, more modern buildings to its skyline. A lot of the city feels ""old"" if that makes sense, though it can be charming. The city is also a little rough around the edges, but not so much in the neighborhoods I mentioned above.

I can answer any questions as best I can, but hopefully this gives a good perspective of what Quito is like as a DN. Personally I had a good time in Quito and I would go back.",6,1771298172.0,digitalnomad,0,1.0,False

 https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/s/w1rSkBhZZN

Firstly, I would like to thanks everyone.

Strangely, for the first time, I actually feel more excited to try, than nervous about it.

So here goes:

I have her phone number since I am in the same church group chat as her, but I really think asking her out by message would be a huge miss...

We will probably meet again in person the next week's sunday, since she generally sings in the last dunday of each month in Church.

Should I ask her for 5 minutes after mass to get an opportunity to talk more privately?

How should I phrase it?

I was thinking of something short like:

""Hey, sorry if this ends up embarrassing or weird. I just think you are a nice person. So if you ever feel like it,  we could go out to get a coffee and talk. I pay...""

Like I said, she seems like a really nice girl, so I don't want to make her fell pressured either.

Also, I don't want to make things awkward for her after this. 

I think I should go with the expectation of a rejection in mind, right?

Internally, I won't be sad even if she says no, since I really wish her the best.

 I just don't want to make her feel weirded out about talking to me just as friends in case she says no....

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Lastly, you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

I was an extremely satisfied customer for the last \~7 years. In 2023, CenturyLink became Quantum Fiber, and then on Feb 2, it became part of AT&T.

On Feb 6, my old CenturyLink modem stopped connecting to the internet. A CS rep told me that the issue would be solved by a backend configuration change in their systems, which would take 24-48 hours.

The issue was still not solved 5 days later, so they scheduled a service appointment. On Feb 12, a technician came to my house and replaced my old CenturyLink modem with a new Q1000K. I was able to connect to the internet again! I was frustrated that it took 6 days but glad that it was resolved.

That lasted about 24 hours.

On Feb 13, I lost my connection to the internet again, and the Q1000K started blinking blue. I spoke with another CS rep, who told me the issue would require another service appointment. I scheduled one for today, with a service window of 2-5pm.

At 1:15pm today, I got a text that the technician was on their way to my house. I immediately left the coffee shop I was working at and rushed home. By the time I got there, the technician had already left. They said they rang the doorbell at 1:30 and no one was home. THIS WAS A HALF HOUR BEFORE THE APPOINTMENT WINDOW STARTED.

I just got off the phone with another CS rep. They told me, essentially, that the first person I spoke with (on Feb 6), who said they created a ""programming escalation ticket"" to resolve my issue, actually did no such thing. THERE WAS NO RECORD OF THIS TICKET ON MY ACCOUNT. They said they actually would create the ticket this time to resolve my issue, and that it would be fixed within 24 hours. I'm skeptical, as you can imagine.

At this point, it's been 10 days, and I'm not any closer to getting reconnected. I'm not sure there's anyone there who actually knows what's wrong with my service, let alone has the ability to fix it.

Take this as a warning if you actually rely on your home internet: Quantum Fiber/AT&T can accidentally disconnect you at any time, and they don't seem to currently have the people or processes in place to fix it in a timely manner.

Spaces are too big?,"This is just my observation in Seattle area. It seems like the new retail spaces under 5 plus 1s and other medium density housing tends to sit empty for a very long time. My significant others building in cap hill has had empty street level retail for months. A new build 3 story development's retail space near me (Eastside) sat empty for 3+ years before some large dentist offices finally moved in. 

When busenesses do move in they are almost always the same few chains. There is no where near the level of diversity of small businesses that I see in a stripmall a half a mile away. In a similarly sided strip mall I can visit a grocery store, pharmacy, two coffee shops, a dentist, a gym, drycleaning, 3 small restaurants, 2 pizza places, two daycares and a martial arts studio. In the new construction mixed use development, I can visit 2 different dental offices and a pet food store. 

I think we are making new build retail spaces too large. These new buildings generally each contain one or two large units whereas the same space in the strip mall is split into 5+ small spaces. They are also new which equates to more expensive. It seems like only chains can afford the new buildings and it's sad to see local businesses get forced out as each strip mall gets redeveloped. 

The strip mall is also far more walkable despite having a large parking lot because I can accomplish multiple errands in one compact complex. Even if the new build places had anything worth visiting, I'd be seeing like 2 places per block max. 

I'm not sure what the answer is. I want to have towns and cities worth walking in but I stop seeing the point when each one has exactly the same chains or empty retail space. 

How can we encourage developers to build smaller, reconfigurable units that allow smaller businesses to thrive?",11,1771297563.0,Urbanism,18,0.92,False

I am also interested in learning Chinese and improving my communication skills. In return, I would be happy to help anyone who wants to practice or improve their English. I believe cultural exchange is a great way to build meaningful friendships.

I have so much free time — weekdays and weekends — and it gets tiring doing everything alone. I miss the days when friends would just randomly come over, we’d watch movies, order food, talk about nonsense until 3am. Or I’d go to their place and tambay lang.

Most of my close friends are already out of the country. I stayed. And sometimes, I can’t help but feel like I failed because of that.

My daily life is very routine:

wake up → work → go out (movie or coffee shop) → go home.

Weekends, since I get overstimulated easily, I just stay in, watch Netflix, order Grab. Repeat.

Parang months na akong walang constant kausap.

Maybe I’m just looking for someone to be alone with.

About me:

– INFJ

– Gay

– Chub

– Agnostic but spiritual

– Mukha daw akong lesbian (I get this a lot lol)

– Dog lover

– Orphan

– Didn’t finish school, puro diskarte

– Recently into theatre

– Watches new movies every Wednesday (because that’s when they come out)

– I love walking long distances

– Good listener daw, with a decent sense of humor

All genders welcome.

The past 4 months have been difficult to say the least out sex life has disappeared due to her birth control which has created a bit of tension. Recently ive began to see how much effort ive put into this relationship and the lack of effort she gives back. I dont know if its a combination of the bad sex life and the rough mental state ive been in but its been rough.

Just to give an example I spent $400ish on Valentines took her to get a massage then a really nice dinner. In return she bought me a $10 coffee mug while I was in line with her at CVS and no sexy time as usual after dinner lol.

For me its not a monetary thing its an effort thing I would have been so happy with a thoughtful hand written note I just want to feel like she thought of me. Around the house I cook, clean, do the laundry and everything else. She may help if I ask multiple times but nothing is done just because she wants to be helpful.

Not to just trash her she really has been great we mesh really well outside of what ive described and have been really happy up until now. Like I have been saying though ive been noticing the lack of effort she puts into the relationship and it has really bugged me.

So I asked if I could stop by ahead of time and scout it out. I wanted to see the space, figure out compositions, and not feel rushed the day of the actual shoot.

Lately I’ve been wanting to push myself. I’ve been thinking about blending journalism and photography. This felt like a good test to see if I can handle that on my own and start developing my style for this sort of approach. 

For this pre shoot, I went over the game plan with the client so we were aligned before I even picked up the camera.

I ordered a coffee, let him handle a few things, then we walked the shop together looking for different angles. I mapped it out a shot list with the client (these aren’t firm but more of a guideline for myself):

	•	3 to 4 wide shots to establish the atmosphere

	•	2 portraits

	•	3 to 4 detail shots

	•	3 composed interaction shots

	•	1 product shots

	•	The rest candid or an extra posed frame if needed

For the wides I used the new Viltrox 16mm. On the real shoot I’ll bring a tripod and bracket exposures. I’m still deciding if I want people in those frames or keep them out.

Everything else was shot on the Lumix 35mm. I didn’t obsess over small distractions since this wasn’t the final shoot, but if it were, I’d remove things like trash cans and the booster seat. I also made sure to get the client’s input on compositions. At one point he wanted to emphasize the doves flying towards a painting. I pushed back a bit because I didn’t feel like that detail added much to the overall story.

I shot a portrait of him, but it confirmed I need better lighting. I tried flash and immediately scrapped it. It just didn’t feel/look right. I’ll probably bring my Amaran 300C next week. It’s technically a video light, but it gives me more control and feels more natural with the softbox attached. 

Editing has been the frustrating part. It was muggy and raining that day, and the light just felt flat or just inconsistent. I’ve been second guessing the edits because of it. That kind of weather can make everything feel dull, and when the files don’t look how you imagined, it messes with your head. I even bounced between Lightroom and Capture One trying to get where I wanted.

These aren’t final edits. Not even close. Part of me wishes I could just shoot primarily in black and white because I am sucker for a good black and white. But that’s not always what the job calls for unfortunately. 

I might go back one more time and hope for sun. If nothing else, this scouting trip did what it was supposed to do. It showed me what works, what doesn’t, and what I need to tighten up before the real shoot.

I like boring. I work, I go to the gym, I play games, repeat- and generally it really is enough outside of times like this. Valentine’s Day and the holidays, and my family badgering me to find someone all compound. Usually I dismiss it as “I’m not lonely, I’m just sexually frustrated, and not enough to do anything about it so it’s ok” but I realized it’s been 7 years since the last time I even kissed a girl, I’ll flirt with women when I’m extremely intoxicated at the clubs but I won’t even bother doing anything beyond that.

Truth is I think I became so jaded that it turned into acceptance and I got too comfortable with it. It really hit home when I thought about going to coffee shops, events, clubs, and my genuine thoughts on them is I feel like it’s a complete waste of time. I don’t want to go to a coffee shop, spend 6$ on a latte and talk to a stranger, I don’t want to bother a woman that is just there to buy something. When I go to a bar I want to play darts and billiards with my boys, not have unexciting small talk with a girl asking questions neither of us give a shit about.

I’ve been on a few dates, about 5 in the past 7 years, and I’ve felt nothing. I can honestly say nobody has excited me in years, sexually, emotionally, intellectually. Most of the time after these dates I think to myself, “why would I bother doing this again” and I haven’t ghosted but I just never invest into it again, and considering I felt that way good chance they did to, only 2 of those dates ever texted me back.

I can think of small things that play into it, porn and social media probably inflate what I want, maybe I can talk to a therapist to find other underlying problems but to be honest I just don’t feel anything, I’m not asexual but honestly idk.

I knew a girl I was deeply in love with, since I was 18. We’ve been friends for 9 years now and she isn’t especially attractive or anything, but I genuinely was obsessed with her. I tried becoming more than friends with her from 18-22, it was complete rejection and no type of situationship. I continued my friendship with her because I genuinely do like what we have, it would have been a horrible relationship since we are too different.

I think I do still have feelings for her, around 22 she got a serious boyfriend, a good guy. At this point I accepted that’s how things would be and I genuinely accepted it.

By 25/26, I genuinely felt moved on and then they broke up and to my disgust I realized I was happy, I didn’t feel genuine happiness until hours after she told me at a bar in the moment I felt upset my 2nd closest friend lost her soul mate. But one evening was all it took to apply selfish hope into what that could mean for me. And 4 weeks later, when they got back together, in the moment I was upset, to the point I don’t think I hid the emotion- I could hear the negativity in my voice when I said I was happy for her.

I feel like a real asshole because of it. I know you can’t turn off loving someone but it felt like I did for years and now the love is a fraction of what I felt and what’s taken its place is just toxic. I’m constantly thinking how I’m superior to this guy when I’m just a normal man and he is to. I haven’t don’t anything but these emotions can’t be good- not one bit.

How can I kill this and keep the friendship? I just can’t give up my friendship with her, nobody interests me like she does, she can talk to me about almost anything and I’ll care, I can tell her things a CIA black ops team couldn’t get out of me you can’t replace something like this, I probably have 1 other friendship like this.

I know she doesn’t want anything with me but i know deep down she’s gotta know that I still want her, we haven’t talked about it in years, but we talk about our relationships, dates, sex, and everything else. If I could tell in the moment how upset I was she had to as well. Why keep me around when she knows this? She can’t be oblivious to how I feel, she obviously hasn’t told her boyfriend all these years, our friendship is great but why keep it around if I could compromise the most important relationship she has?

The only option I think I got is to replace it- find someone else, how can I feel even partially good about it? Every time I go out I think the girls I talk with can tell I don’t care in the slightest- doesn’t matter how hot they are or anything. My heart isn’t there. I don’t think I’m comparing them to her but the dopamine hit you need to even make another relationship happen is not there. It feels worse than work- it feels like I’m hurting myself, like I’m slamming a door onto my foot repeatedly to try to fix it and nothing happens.

I can’t lie a lot of that was spontaneous self realization I just kept going. I know a lot of it portrayed me very negatively, I’m certainly not evil or a psycho, but I had to be very honest with myself to post this, so please go easy on me, any advice is appreciated.",1,1771295939.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

My wife uses reddit but doesn’t know my main account, still wanna be extra cautious. 

I have been married for 8 years to my wife (31F) and we have 2 children under 6. We grew up on the same street but never really got to know each other until I was out of college. My now wife confessed having a longstanding crush on me ever since we were kids, and we started dating. We had a pretty linear relationship, got married, bought a house, had kids, got situated in our careers. Life is objectively great for our family. 

HOWEVER. When I met my now wife, I was out of the relationship I referenced in the title. This woman (we’ll call her Grace) and I dated for 3 years. We met in college but our relationship got more serious during senior year. She got accepted into a T5 law school and moved away. Our relationship fizzled due to distance and we lost touch. 

The thing is, as weird as it sounds, I loved her ever more as time went by. I never got over her. The days we spent together were nothing short of bliss. We never argued. She was never bitter, angry, or mean. Her personality was larger than life and she brightened every place she walked into. Besides all that, she was stunningly attractive. A natural beauty with a gorgeous smile, funny as hell, and charming. I never met anyone (platonic or otherwise) who came even close to her. 

Now why we broke up? For starters, the distance was tough but I am sure we could have made it work. We came from a small town in the south and our families weren’t exactly thrilled about us (I am black and she’s white) but also not actively against it. Just one of those background issues.

Instead of toughing it out and making my relationship with Grace work, I took the easy route. Married my wife who has been nothing but good to me, had children, built a life. 

Now I miss this woman more than ever. These past few weeks have been rough. She’s an accomplished lawyer now, partner at a law firm. I saw pictures on instagram from Super Bowl week and there she was, with her boyfriend/fiancé who plays in the NFL. Seeing those pictures gutted me. Seeing her as stunning as always, happy, and smiling next to this rich, objectively handsome man (according to the internet) hurt more than I care to admit. 

Couple nights ago, I was feeling really down and I decided to message her on Instagram. I didn’t think she’d see my message let alone respond. I basically said something along the lines of “long time no talk, I hope you’re doing well”) and she hearted my message. No verbal response. I was so excited to hear *anything* from her that I sent another one, asking if she ever comes back to \[city we lived in\]. She responded with “no, not really”. Now I am feeling even worse than I did before and part of me wishes she never even acknowledged my message. 

I have no one to tell this to. My friends from back then still remember her and occasionally bring her up. My wife knew we were dating way back (she admitted to secretly hoping we’d break up so she could have a chance) but that’s it. I feel trapped. Every good thing that happens to me, every place I visit, I wish Grace were there to see it. 

Help a brother out. How do I get out of this mental state I can’t seem to escape? Prt of me accepted that we’ll realistically never be together. But another part clings to the memories and life we could have had. I know I’ll look desperate but I am considering throwing one last ditch effort and asking her to catch up over coffee. I don’t know. May be closure. 

TL;DR: I am still madly in love with the woman I dated in my younger years. I messaged her and her response rattled me more. I feel unhappy despite having a good life with my family. ",0,1771295931.0,WhatShouldIDo,18,0.36,False
1r6u0dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/enshittification/comments/1r6u0dv/is_the_world_getting_much_worse_or_am_i_just/,Is the world getting much worse or am I just getting old?,"**TL;DR** Is everything *(technology trends, social norms, boundaries)* getting exponentially worse or am I *(early 30s from USA)* just getting old and refusing to adapt to change? 

Social media is full of bots rage baiting and talking to each other, cost of living is rising, everything is becoming a monthly subscription service, AI is forced upon you everywhere you look and threatening to take your job, news articles are farming clicks with shock-inducing titles and the pump at the gas station is about to ask you to leave a tip.

Please give context **if replying outside the US. I’m curious** if the rest of the world observes similar or different issues.  

I’ll break up the post in specific areas with bullet points to help with structure. I'm very aware of the ""old = good, new = bad"" mentality, as well as how popular it is to hate on things and farm engagement but I'm trying to have a discussion. 

I don't mean to be a hater but these are the things and trends I've observed and knowing how things are now is definitely a bit saddening...  

\--------------------------------------------------

# Technology, software and (mobile) applications

* Apps keep adding bloat. Often it is features no one requested. It **feels like busy work for developers and project managers so they have something to show on their performance review.** It is always automatically enabled at start so it can be heavily ""adopted"" at launch and sometimes there is no way to turn it off! 
* Things are more buggy too but I don’t blame them. There are so many operating system, browsers, app version, device versions to juggle and ensure perfect working conditions with. And all the constant integrations (goal to trade user data?) for example **Venmo** with **Uber Eats** and **Facebook** with any website that has a login. Sounds like a disaster of dependencies to keep track of. Many desktop websites don't look anything like their mobile version and often have missing features or confusing interface. Most recently I'm noticing r/iOS and the pour of horrible feedback related to iOS 28.
* For those reasons everything seems overly complicated and tied in a web. 
   * Have you tried clicking a link on Instagram? It opens in in-app browser, then redirects to the App Store, then back to Instagram and gives you an error ""Sorry something went wrong"" with no explanation. You don't know where to report a bug but even if you did - it's too exhausting to write steps to reproduce for a ticket that will end in a black hole.
   * I recently wanted to change the jingle on my iPhone to a specific sound and the amount of hoops it was making me jump got me overwhelmed. Had to use Garage Band to save the sound as a ringtone extension, then connect my phone to a Macbook, download an old version of iTunes, and sync it or something like that. Too long, too exhausting for a simple feature I accomplished in 1 minute on a Sony Erikson K750i
   * Vague but there are. **Too. Many. Options**. I get customization is important, people want to be able to tailor but clicking the three dots Settings on anything is overwhelming
* In the late 2000s and early 2010s it was exciting to get **app updates**. Nowadays it feels rushed, pointless and the app release notes don’t tell anything. Release notes used to mean we fixed X or implemented Y but now is just generic **“We squashed bugs to make the app better for you”** \- squashing none of the obvious bugs, adding things no one asked for but instead probably more tracking and greedy things. No more transparency, only vague explanations...
* I also understand why apps **push mandatory updates** so frequently - but it’s becoming exhausting. In the early days of smartphones, it wasn’t a big deal. Most of us only had around ten apps, we were familiar with their features, and updates were relatively rare. It was easy to keep track of what changed. Now, it’s a completely different situation. We have close to a hundred apps, and many of them update every single week. It’s impossible to keep up with all the changes. That’s why I keep auto-updates turned off. I prefer to update apps intentionally - when I need to - so I expect and am prepared for changes. What’s frustrating is being forced into updates and then being surprised by changes right when I’m trying to use the app.
* The trend of apps wanting to be the everything app has frustrated me at first but I've come more to terms with it... Sure **Instagram**, you can have a **Twitter** alternative. Sure **YouTube**, you can have **TikTok**\-style shorts. Sure **Spotify**, you can get into podcasts. But I draw the line at **Reddit** adding Games to their website.... or playing games on **Netflix**... or shopping on TikTok.... or playing games on Amazon... Amazon is for shopping, Netflix is for watching movies. Do people really want to be in a single echo system - Shop on Amazon, watch Amazon shows only, listen to Amazon music, read Amazon books? Is this capitalism? Isn't that bad? Competition is good.
* Opening a new website page is a crazy experience. First you get hit with the Privacy Policy mandatory window (I always reject all Optional Cookies). Then a popup with an offer to sign up for a newsletter. Then scrolling while dodging ads and another popup... If you move your cursor to the X button you get another popup - ""**Don't leave, take 3% off with this code!**"". This same experience on a tiny phone is even worse, be careful not to tap one of the ads or you'll get malware on your phone and need to call a number! 
* **Streaming services** keep increasing monthly prices, removing content left and right with and without notice. **Netflix** *(the site that killed piracy and was tweeting ""love is sharing a password"")*, went back on that statement by enforcing account sharing restrictions and adding more paywall plans... Forget geographical restrictions, my friend couldn't put on Netflix on more than 2 concurrent screens in her house, on the same Wi-Fi - you have to pay more to be able to watch more than 2... A comedian had a skit saying **""NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is considering for the 2027 season that each quarter of an NFL game to be broadcast on a different streaming service. First quarter is on Netflix, second quarter is on ESPN Unlimited, third quarter is on Amazon Prime, fourth quarter is on Peacock""**. A good joke surely but are we far away from this happening?
* Very predatory language - when you get a popup for a feature you don't want, there is no ""No thanks"" option, it always says ""Not yet"" or ""Maybe later"". Always trying to leave the door open. 
* On the topic of AI - I'm not even going to write that much. Everyone are exposed enough today to know what is going on. Every company is throwing everything they have at developing their AI at the **cost of RAM and storage drives** for the normal consumers... **It's very frustrating to want to upgrade your PC but being priced out of it, while at the same time being forced to use the thing that made it so unobtainable.** 
* Even AI started milking, farming and pushing enshittification already. At least Chat GPT is intentionally repeating your prompt, summarizing twice, using emojis and generally yapping a lot to use a lot of credits so you run out of Free plan and buy one of their paid plans. There was also an update to Terms & Conditions where **they said ads will come** in Free and Go plans, so there's that. 
* It feels like everyone are squeezing and squeezing for that extra cent or that extra data to collect and sell... 
   * I saw a headline **Amazon Kindle** latest update prohibits you from uploading a free PDF, you can only read books you have bought from the store. 
   * **Spotify** doesn't let you copy and paste any song names or artists, in case you are copying and pasting to try to download somewhere else. 
   * **YouTube** and **Twitch can** serve 8 ads in a row. **YouTube** continues to add paywall like you can't change the video speeds if you are not Premium member.
   * **Discord** in the news these days for the ID checking, spawning further discussions on internet privacy and real age verification.
   * **Customer Support** is almost dead, replaced by self-serve community forums, a horribly designed and often broken Documentation Help Center or poor AI that can't scratch topics 1 layer deeper than the generic ""You placed your order. It's on the way""
   * A year or so ago **Reddit** was in the news for disabling their API to many apps... all with the goal to funnel more people to their main app and serve ads to more people (eliminating the free, ad free alternatives)

# Social Media

* I mentioned **Facebook** in the last section so I need to expand some more. The transition to the ""**For You**"" feed is one of the worst things that happened to Social Media. AFAIK in Facebook you can no longer change it, on Instagram you can but you have to click 3 extra times every-time you open the app to see it. Of course it has to be inconvenient, you can't simply remember this decision because Meta got $10 from someone to show their bakery 1000 times so it has to end up on my feed. 
* Monetization also added the creator aspect. Social media used to be social with friends. Now it's a place to serve ads from businesses. Which is fine I guess. There were ads on newspapers we read in the 1990s but it feels like we had something nice that got spoiled. **If it's free then you are the product**, everyone on this sub knows. 
* In 2026 there's **no point of following any account.** If you interact with the topic or person enough, you will be served their content. Count of followers is no longer a metric to show growth. If you are a creator and go ""viral"" good luck following up and making it a job. To be discovered on Social Media you gotta post every day and have great engagement. **You know who isn't posting every day? Your friends from high school.** So you won't see them on your feed ever because Facebook is prioritizing the hustling content creators trying to capture engagement from rage baited or AI images...
* **Doom-scrolling** is fully alive and working at the expense of wasting peoples time and impacting their mental health. These apps are ruthless, they don't care about quality or limitations. Just pedal to the metal - report to the board ""time spent in app"" to show how good it is. What better way than making the page endless. Anyone else remember when you could the bottom of the page. It had an option ""Go to next page"" which felt like a natural stopping point, now you have to click away with your own will power. 
* All the content is now locked without an account. You used to be able to read a Tweet for ""free"". Now you have to make an account because of course they need an email to send you marketing to and sell your information. TikTok is the same, can't watch if you aren't registered. 

# Gaming

* Gaming in general feels so min-max now... Because of content creators and websites - you are pressured to only use the meta build. The best gun and attachments, the best spells, talents. Otherwise you will get beat. I understand this is mostly online, competitive games but dang. I'm pretty much tricked into optimizing the games I play now because I got feared I am otherwise wasting time. 
* Games get rushed to release to appease the shareholders with many bugs. Remember [Cyberpunk 2077 launch disaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyoJ7onNrg)? Yes, the game now is much better state and has won back the community but the release was a painful time, and there were similar games in the same path. Nowadays gaming studios could afford to ship a half-finished or buggy product and fix it later with patches... which brings to my next point
* All games now require online connectivity, including Single Player... Why? So they can show you a store page and serve you new micro transactions. I understand micro transactions for free-to-play games but for games you have bought? 
* I don't think it's even popular to talk s%i$ about micro transactions anymore. This got so normalized in the past years that now in 2026 it's expected which is unfortunate.
* Mobile games and gacha games surprise me with every salesman trick in the book. 
   * FOMO! This skin will disappear in 14 hours, 20 minutes, 51 seconds and 55 miliseconds
   * Big flashing animation pop ups everytime you open the game
   * Hiding the price until the item is in your cart *(on the off-chance you forget you added it later or accidentally check out)*
   * RNG loot boxes which brings me to my next points 

# Everything else

* **Gambling** is everywhere in the USA now. It keeps getting approved in more states and there are so many of them - Fan Duel, Draft Kings, Kalshi, Poly Market.... Streamers online are getting paid for Rain Bet, Ace Bet and other similar platforms...
* **Crypto** is also very prominent - Coinbase, Kraken. It seems like everyone wants to get your money deposited and time in the app. 
* **Black Friday** isn't a thing anymore. Sales start in November and they are questionable. Are they inflating the price of item to then have it say discounted? Amazon keeps pushing 10% discounts rest of the year as a ""deal"" which is insulting it's practically the same price...
* Also feels nothing goes down in price anymore, only up. Seems like every 6 months some service announces a price increase or a subscription model. 
* **We don't really own anything anymore.** Everything is getting tied to a subscription service which is controlled by copyright laws. Is the new budget meta to physically own music, video? I'm **scared for Steam** \- if one day they shut down and our purchased libraries disappear or can't be played offline.
* Walmart employees are wearing cameras. Target and CVS have toothbrushes and other items are **locked behind glass doors** because people are stealing and corps can't eat a $10 loss or hire more security / personnel.
* Our microwaves, fridges, washing machine and other appliances **don't need Wi-Fi and AI integration**... I don't need AI to tell me when I'll drink my first cup of coffee.
* I can't prove this but it feels like **every new merchandise or product is worse**. I have slippers from 2015 that are in one piece but the new ones I bought in 2025 already got ripped. It feels like cheaper materials are used and things aren't as durable as before. We had to replace my family oven from the 2000s... the new one is such s#%\*, it takes so much longer to cook everything evenly, compared to the old one. And it was so much more expensive of course because of smart features which made it more complicated and easy to breakdown... 
* **Influencer manipulation** \- the oven we got was highly rated on multiple sites, we watched multiple video reviews and it turned out bad. Could it be a bad batch? Sure. But I can't help but think we should actively avoid products that are heavily advertised.
* On the influencer topic - there are all these snacks, foods and drinks that are so bad for you or way too expensive but have influencer marketing (Pokimane, Logan Paul, etc).
* Everywhere they are **asking for a tip.** In Europe you don’t have to tip and in the US you only used to tip waitresses and bartenders. Now it’s baristas, fast food places too. The greed of asking me to tip on an order I’m picking up is annoying.  

# Conclusion

If you read all the way to the end - thank you and I'm sorry...

Any recommendations to address the changes, new ideas to help adapt? Am I very out of pocket for these opinions? Is there light at the end of the tunnel or is the world headed for the dystopian future?

Surely there must be collectives or communities that can reverse where things are headed? Or is it all government and corporation greed?

[#2],"Ever since becoming mayor of New York City, James Jonah Jameson — affectionately known as “JJ” to the public — had been wracked with nothing but problems, from the city’s public transport nightmares to aged infrastructure, even to the childcare crisis plaguing New York’s parents. Now there was a massive meltdown in the criminal underworld, all thanks to rumours of a burly masked man in a hoodie beating up two of Joseph Martello’s men.

Police Commissioner George Stacy had been summoned to the mayor’s office precisely because of the hooded vigilante. A cigarette-chewer, JJ could smell the tobacco on his police chief without him having even entered the waiting room. They spoke — it was more of a one-sided briefing from JJ to Commissioner Stacy — for exactly forty-five minutes before he left the office, the scent of nicotine drifting not too far behind.

Commissioner Stacy ordered a citywide briefing across all the precincts, with his daughter, Detective Gwen Stacy, being first and foremost among the audience. He spoke at length about what to expect, and the impossibility of their vigilante being armed. One thing was certain: the mayor wanted him identified and brought in, while Joseph Martello wanted him dead. Worst case scenario, the vigilante starts a war between the Hammerhead and the NYPD.

Detective Stacy watched as the department left the meeting, either out the door or by ending the virtual call, knowing something most didn’t: there was a financial accountant in Martello’s circle, someone who would be the first to know if anything happened. The attack had happened during protection money rounds, so money was involved. And that meant the accountant would know a thing or two. She quietly slipped into the bathroom and made a call.

Peter had returned to Joseph’s office clearly aware of the tension. The attack last night rattled everyone in the Hammerhead’s organisation. Nobody trusted each other — they never did in the first place — and the slightest misstep would see him branded a rat and fed to the fish. He quickly made a cup of Joseph’s favourite coffee and presented it to the mobster in his office, gaining the chance to stay and talk. It was then that Joseph, in a half-drunk, half-sleepless stupor, muttered something that shook Peter to the core: something about a kitchen fire and how he felt like said kitchen.

Returning to the Yancy Street apartment, Peter bumped into Felicia, fresh out of a pickpocketing spree. They argued, then he confided in her about what he had heard. This made her the first, and only, member of the Streetside Six to learn about his employment under the infamous Hammerhead. She said nothing, instead running a hand down his shoulder out of encouragement. She went to bed before Peter’s cell rang; the number belonged to an old friend.",1,1771295533.0,WhatIfMarvel,0,1.0,False

Conversations we have consist of them just monologuing at me, and when I do get a word in, I often get interrupted/ cut off.

WHICH THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH if it wasn’t constant and done in a way that leaves me feeling stupid

The last straw was when I was at the kitchen table with headphones on getting work done (facing away from them) and I hear them trying to talk to me, and then they KNOCK on the coffee table to try to get my attention ((which i did not give them)). When I took my headphones off to have a conversation with this roommate + other roommate- after this convo happened  i went back to work they kept talking to me even though I was clearly busy and was not really engaging 😭

1r6tlzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1r6tlzr/last_words/,Last Words,"I don't tell this to people. I want you to understand that before I start. Not because I think I'll be made fun of, I'm past caring about that, but because every time I've tried to tell it, I can hear how it sounds. I can hear myself losing people.

I'm not crazy. I know that's exactly what a crazy person would say, but I've thought about this for ten years and I cannot find the version of this story that has a normal ending. I've tried. I have genuinely, seriously tried.

So. Here it is.

This was the summer after I graduated. I was twenty-two. I had a biology degree I didn't know what to do with, my dad had died six months earlier, and a friend of mine, Aaron, you wouldn't know him, told me about the Wildlife Preservation Corps. AmeriCorps-adjacent program, puts recent grads out in the field doing survey work. Counting animals, maintaining trail cameras, invasive species mapping. Honest work. Outdoor work.

I want to be upfront about the grief. Not because it explains what happened, I don't think it does, but because I know what you're thinking, and I want to address it directly. Yes, I had recently lost my father. Yes, I was twenty-two and processing that badly in the way you do at twenty-two when you don't have the vocabulary for it yet.

But I was not in crisis. I was not unstable. The WPC program requires a physical and a psychological screening and I passed both.

I went to Montana partly to be useful and partly to be somewhere that didn't feel like home. My dad grew up in the Pacific Northwest. He used to say the quiet out there was a different kind of quiet than anywhere else. Not absence of sound but presence of something too old to make noise. He always said he'd take me someday. We ran out of somedays faster than we expected.

So in some way, I suppose I went for both of us.

I signed up for a ten-week term in the Kootenai National Forest in northwestern Montana, which is about as deep into nowhere as you can get while still technically being in the United States.

I want you to picture the geography because it matters.

The Kootenai is not like the forests in movies. It's not pretty in an approachable way. It's enormous in a way that makes you feel erased. Old growth Douglas fir and western larch going up sixty, seventy feet, the canopy so thick that midday feels like dusk. The undergrowth is dense enough that you lose sight of your survey partner fifteen feet off the trail. There are maybe four roads in a three hundred square mile survey block, and those roads are logging roads - unmaintained, unlisted, the kind you find on USGS topo maps from the 1970s that may or may not still exist when you need them.

We had a base camp. Six of us total, split into three pairs. My partner was a woman named Gretchen, mid-thirties, ex-Army, she'd done three WPC terms already. Competent and quiet. Not unfriendly, just economical with words. I liked her.

The first five weeks were fine. Better than fine, actually. I was happy. Genuinely happy, which surprised me. I'd see black bears at a hundred yards and my whole body would light up. I had a sense of purpose I hadn't felt since before my dad got sick. I slept well. I stopped thinking about student loans and grad school applications and the specific silence of a house where someone used to be.

What I'm trying to tell you is that I wasn't in a bad mental state. I wasn't primed to imagine things. I was genuinely, straightforwardly okay.

I want that on the record.

The first odd thing was the elk.

Week six. Gretchen and I were running a transect, that's a predetermined line you walk, recording every animal sign you find, tracks, scat, browse marks. Our transect that day ran about eight miles through a drainage valley, creek on the left, ridge slope on the right, deep timber on both sides.

We'd been out maybe two hours when we came across an elk standing at the edge of the tree line about forty yards ahead of us, facing our direction.

Elk spook easy. You come around a bend and surprise one, they're gone before you've finished being surprised. This one wasn't spooked. It was watching us with a quality of attention I'd never seen on a large animal. Not the white-eyed rolling attention of something scared, but focused. Deliberate.

My dad used to watch me play baseball like that. Not in the proud, obvious way other dads did. More quiet than that. Like he was paying close attention to something that mattered and didn't want to miss any of it. I don't know why I thought of that in the moment. It was just the quality of the gaze. The stillness behind it.

""That's weird,"" I said.

""Yeah,"" Gretchen said. She'd stopped walking.

We stood there for maybe two minutes. The elk stood there.

Not grazing, not looking away, not doing any of the things elk do. Just watching us with that strange steady patience. Then it walked back into the trees. Normal gait. Calm.

Gretchen watched the tree line for a moment after it disappeared.

""Huh,"" she said, and wrote something in her field log, and we kept going. I thought about it for the rest of the day. I have never seen an animal look at me like that. Like it was paying attention to something that mattered.

I didn't write it in my own field log. I don't know why. It didn't feel like something I should write down.

The sounds started around week seven.

Base camp was two wall tents and a cook tent, set up in a small clearing about a hundred yards off a logging road. At night, after dinner, you'd sit outside for a while and listen to the forest. Owls, coyotes in the distance, frogs down by the water, wind working through the tops of the firs. A full, layered sound that made the world feel old.

I woke up around 2 AM on a Thursday.

I remember it was Thursday because we'd had a resupply drop the day before and I'd eaten an actual orange for the first time in two weeks and I remember lying there half-awake, thinking about nothing in particular.

Someone was talking outside the tent.

Not loudly. Low. Conversational. The register of someone talking to someone else at normal indoor distance. I couldn't make out words. I lay still and listened and could not parse any words out of it, just the cadence.

Two voices, or maybe one voice talking and something responding in a lower register. Back and forth. Easy, like they'd been talking for a while. There was something about the lower register, the responding voice, that I couldn't place. A familiar weight to it that I kept reaching for and not finding. Like a word on the tip of your tongue.

My first thought was Gretchen was on a satellite phone call. She had one for emergencies, occasionally called her husband. I checked my watch. 2:17 AM. I lay there for another minute. It kept going.

I unzipped my sleeping bag and put my boots on and unzipped the tent. The clearing was empty. Gretchen's tent was zipped shut and dark. The fire pit was cold. The logging road was just visible through the trees, pale in the moonlight.

Nothing.

I stood there in the cold for a moment, listening. The forest made its normal sounds. Frogs. Wind. The distant scraping of tree limbs across rockface. I went back to bed. Told myself it was Gretchen on the phone and she'd gone back inside before I got out. Told myself sound in forest clearings does strange things, bounces off tree lines, gets distorted. I almost believed myself.

What I didn't let myself think about, not then, not for a long time, was that the lower voice had reminded me of someone. Specifically.

I brushed the thought away and left it there.

In the morning I mentioned it to Gretchen. Casually. She looked up from her oatmeal. ""What time?""

""Around two.""

She looked at me for a moment. Then back at her oatmeal.

""I didn't make any calls,"" she said.

""Maybe I dreamed it.""

""Maybe,"" she said.

She didn't say anything else about it. But she'd looked at me with an expression I filed away and kept coming back to later. Not skeptical. Something more like recognition. Like she was deciding how much to say, and deciding not yet.

I didn't push. Some instinct said let it be.

The next oddity came from the cameras.

Trail cameras. We had sixteen of them placed around the survey block, motion-triggered, running twenty-four hours. Every two weeks we'd pull the SD cards and swap fresh ones in, bring the cards back to camp, load the images.

In nine weeks we got what you'd expect. Deer, elk, black bear, one mountain lion, a lot of birds. Also, because cameras don't discriminate, a lot of dark frames. Motion triggers on blowing branches, insects walking across the lens, pure false positives.

Week seven, camera nine, placed about three miles from base camp, east side of the survey block, came back with a run of dark frames. Not unusual. But this run was long. Forty-seven consecutive frames, triggered a minute to two minutes apart, through a window of about 1:45 to 3:10 AM. Something had been moving in front of that camera for roughly ninety minutes without triggering a clean image.

I spent an hour trying to find something in the dark frames. You can pull detail out of underexposed images if you push the contrast and adjust the curve. I worked at them until my eyes hurt.

In frame thirty-one I found something.

Not a shape. More like an absence of grain. The digital noise of a dark frame is random; even and scattered, like static. In frame thirty-one there was a region in the lower right of the image, roughly two feet by three, where the grain was not random. Where the pattern was too regular. Too smooth.

I sat with that frame for longer than I should have.

There was something about the quality of the stillness in it. Something that felt, and I know how this sounds, deliberate. Patient. The kind of still that isn't waiting to move. The kind of still that's just there, and has been for a while, and is in no hurry about any of it.

Like it knew the camera. Like it had taken the time to learn exactly where the light ended. I showed it to Gretchen. She looked at it for a long time.

""Wind on brush,"" she said. But she said it the way you say something you've decided to say, not the way you say something you believe.

""Yeah,"" I said.

She handed the laptop back to me. Then stopped.

""What's the nearest road from camera nine?""

I checked the topo. ""About nine miles. Give or take.""

She nodded and went to bed without another word.

I still have that image. I've shown it to people. Two of them saw what I saw right away and then didn't want to talk about it anymore. The rest saw noise.

I understand both reactions.

The last thing. This is the one I haven't told anyone, and I mean that literally. Not my wife. Not Aaron. No one.

Week nine. September, now, the light starting to go gold and thin in the afternoons the way it does up there when the season turns. Gretchen was running a quick solo errand to a camera station, an out-and-back she'd done a dozen times. I was alone in camp doing data entry.

It had been a quiet day. A good day, actually. I'd been thinking about my dad on and off, which happened more on the good days than the hard ones. He was born three hours west of where I was sitting. I kept wondering if he'd ever been out this way. Kept thinking I should have asked him more questions when I had the chance.

I heard someone coming down the logging road. Footsteps in gravel. Even, unhurried. I assumed it was one of the other teams coming back early. I kept working. They stopped at the edge of the clearing.

I looked up.

The road was empty in both directions. The clearing was empty. The footsteps had stopped exactly where the gravel met the grass and didn't start again.

I sat there for a moment.

Then, from the tree line on the opposite side of the clearing, maybe sixty feet away,

""Hey, Tiger.""

I want to tell you what that did to me. I want to explain it carefully because I need you to understand it wasn't fear, exactly. Or not only fear. Tiger is not my name. It's not close to my name. It is not a nickname anyone has ever called me except one person in my entire life. My dad. He'd called me that since I was small. I don't even know the origin of it, I just know that for my entire life, from the time I could remember, I was Tiger to him and only him. My mom never used it. My sister never used it. My friends never used it. Aaron, who has known me since we were fourteen, has never called me that once.

It was his word for me. Private and specific in the way only a parent's nickname for a child can be private and specific.

And then.

Two more words, quieter than the first, in the same voice, his voice, worn down to the version it had become at the end, the cracked and careful voice of a man spending everything he had left, said into the September air of the Kootenai National Forest:

""Be good.""

I did not move for a very long time. I want to be honest about what I felt. There was the wrongness, yes.. that global systemic wrongness when the body understands something before the brain does. But there was something underneath it that I have spent ten years turning over in my hands, something I don't have the right word for.

It felt, God help me, like being seen.

I called back. I said hello. I said who's there, I said Dad. My voice sounded normal, which surprised me.

Nothing.

The forest made its sounds. A woodpecker somewhere. More wind. When Gretchen came back, she found me still at the table and took one look at me and asked what happened. I told her. All of it. The voice, the name, the two words.

She sat down across from me. Was quiet for a minute. ""In my second term,"" she said. ""Northern Idaho. I heard my daughter's voice."" She looked at her hands. ""She was four at the time. Calling for me. From the woods.""

I waited.

""I looked,"" she said. ""For a long time."" She picked up her water bottle. ""Whatever it is, it doesn't come to the edge. It just wants you to come to the edge.""

And then, after a pause, something she said differently than everything else. Quieter. Like she was saying it to herself as much as to me:

""I've never decided if that's a cruelty or a kindness.""

She didn't say anything else about it. Neither did I.

We finished the term. I went home.

Here's what I need you to understand about ""Be good.""

Those were the last words my father ever said to me. The last real conversation. He was three days from the end and we both knew it. He'd been drifting in and out for a week by that point, the morphine doing its work, and there were long stretches where he wasn't fully present. But that afternoon he was there. Fully there. He found my hand and held it with more strength than I thought he had left and he looked at me for a long time without saying anything.

Then: ""Be good.""

Not I love you, though I knew that. Not I'm proud of you, though I think I knew that too. Just those two words, in his voice, weighted with everything they were meant to carry.

That was the last thing.

Nobody was there for that conversation except the two of us. My mom had stepped out to get coffee. My sister was in the waiting room. It was him and me and those two words and then three days later he was gone. I have never told anyone what he said. Until right now.

Until you.

So you understand what I'm telling you. Not just that something in the woods of Montana spoke in my dead father's voice. But that it spoke in the specific worn- down version of that voice that only existed at the end.

And that it knew a name no one else has ever used for me. And that it repeated the last private thing he ever said, in the last private moment we ever had. Whatever was at the edge of those trees had gone looking for the thing that would reach me deepest. And it found it. Found something I didn't know could be found.

I don't know what it was. I've stopped trying to classify it. Stopped running it through the filters of what I believe and don't believe. I was raised practical. I'm a scientist by training. I've spent ten years looking for the explanation that fits and I don't have one. What I have instead is a question I can't stop asking.

Because here's what stays with me. Here's the thing that keeps me up sometimes.. not in fear, exactly, just in a state of not knowing. Gretchen said whatever it is doesn't come to the edge. It just wants you to come to the edge.

But she also said she'd never decided if that was a cruelty or a kindness.

I've thought about her daughter. Four years old, calling from the woods. I've thought about what it means that it reached into Gretchen's life and found that specific voice. I've thought about what it means that it reached into mine. Something that hunts you with what you love is a predator. I know that. I've turned that over enough times to know it.

But something that reaches across whatever it reached across to give you two more words from someone who ran out of words..

I don't know what that is.

I'm not sure those two things are mutually exclusive. And I'm not sure which one scares me more.

I'm married now. Kids of my own. A good life, exactly the kind of life my dad would have wanted for me and I can say that without it hurting the way it used to. This spring I've booked a cabin. Eight miles outside the Kootenai. Good fishing, the reviews said, beautiful country, kids would love it. All true. I meant it.

But I'd be lying if I said that was the only reason. I've thought about Gretchen's daughter. Still four years old in that story, because Gretchen never finished it. I've thought about what it would mean if she'd gone to the edge. I've thought about what it would mean if she hadn't.

My kids are six and eight. They've never heard this story. They think we're going fishing. I keep telling myself I just want to see it again. The forest. The place where it happened. Closure, or something like closure. The kind of thing you talk yourself into when you need a reason that sounds normal. But lying in bed the night after I booked it, I found myself thinking about my dad the way I hadn't in years.

Not the end, not the hospital, not the voice in the woods. Just him. The way he used to watch from the bleachers. The way a house sounds when someone who made noise in it is gone.

And I thought: what if it's still there. 

And I didn't feel afraid. 



That's the part I don't know what to do with. That's the part I needed to tell someone. That I heard my dead father's voice in the deep woods of Montana ten years ago, speaking words no one else could have known.

And I'm going back.

And if I'm being honest with you...

I really, really hope it's still there.",9,1771294847.0,nosleep,2,0.85,False

Im a high school student from Toronto, I’m looking to have my first job be at the Starbucks across the road, but after applying to 70 locations in the GTA, I got rejected by the AI on all of them with the same letter. I fine tuned my resume already 10 times, and I’m wondering if I should just go and give the manager my resume personally. Can any baristas especially if you’re from Canada help me out here and tell me if I should bother?

Useless backstory now that you’ve read the important part:

I’ve always loved watching how the baristas craft the drinks, even watched YouTube videos of baristas just vlogging their work. 

Recently I went to a busy mall location and had to wait \~10 mins in line and another \~20 mins for my drink. But honestly it didn’t bother me, because I saw how fast that barista was. It was crazy yall, she was literally a sbux sonic. And her friend was printing orders faster than even she could handle them. But this made me want to work there even more, I like pressure, it makes me really efficient.

But anyways, I like coffee and make knockoff Starbucks at home all the time, but I don’t have any professional experience.",0,1771294837.0,starbucks,5,0.17,False

I wrote 515 words last night and 1,073 words today; a good bit of progress both word count and plot advancement. Somehow, though, it still doesn't feel like enough. I want to write more but I also don't want to write anything for a week. I am rather certain I felt this way near the end of Midnight Whorrors to so I suppose this is just how I get when I am nearing the end of a story; fatigued and feral for a break. There are two more little parts for this scene and then we are on to the final stretch of the chapter. It is going to be a long stretch, I am sure, but at least it is the end. Until, of course, the epilogue. Then we get the actual ending. Again my deadline shifts; at this point I am reduced to hoping that I'll have this chapter down before my day at the theatre and I can finish the epilogue afterwards. Will I manage this? Who knows.

I don't have much else to tell you. Father used my laptop today to try to his petrol card and accidentally bought a new one instead, I think. I left him to it when the yelling started. He can use the laptop alone without my help now that he has a mouse, or he should be able to thought the screaming puts some doubt into that fact. I was worried for a moment there that he was going to break the laptop. No idea how the petrol card ending up but at least the laptop is in tact. The weather is slowly turning and the snow is gradually melting. My body is not taking the transition well. I am not as tired or foggy minded now but I am having some digestive issues now. My appetite is finicky. I struggle to make myself eat except when I am absolutely ravenous. Again, I am hoping it is just the change of the weather and annoying as it can be, I will take all of this over a migraine any day.

Now, I am going to relax for a while and hope that my evening coffee will help me write a little more tonight. I am so close to finishing this scene, it is torturing me.

When we were alone it seemed as if she was probing about my personal situation, like where / who I live with / my dynamic with my housemate etc. When it came to parting ways, I looked back as I was walking away and she was just watching me and had this look…. Almost as if she touched me. 

For reference, she’s a couple years older than me (35F) who is in relationship with a man and lives with him, and has been for the past half decade. 

We met up briefly for coffee once after, she indirectly said she doesn’t like sex (in the context of people having children). When she asked me what I was up to, I happened to have met a guy and went on a date-y thing with him. Anyway, she seemed upset by it… and kept saying how surprised she was?

1r6tk0c,https://i.redd.it/24x4kypjsyjg1.jpeg,The 1992 Kelly Klein Pools Party and Michael’s inappropriate behavior with Carolyn.,"I wanted to share this quote from photographer Rose Hantman who attended this party:

“Photographer Rose Hantman first encountered Carolyn Bessette at a fall 1992 party celebrating the publication of Pools, a coffee-table book of swimming pool snapshots by Kelly Klein. Vogue magazine sponsored the event, which took place at a healthspa swimming pool in an exclusive East Side apartment building. JFK Jr., having ended his first goround with Carolyn Bessette, made a brief appearance, staying long enough to be photographed with both Calvin and Kelly Klein.

""Carolyn Bessette was there, doing PR,"" said Hantman. it was the sort of party known as a ""rat f\*ck"" — a collection of boldfaced names and hangers-on. John Kennedy stepped off the elevator, sending a bolt of electricity through the party. But the press missed a tiny drama that evening. Carolyn Bessette was there, as was her sometime boyfriend, Michael Bergin, an aspiring model and doorman at the trendy Paramount Hotel. Bergin was one of the shapely young men circulating in loincloths with trays of canapes. Before leaving, Kennedy walked over to Carolyn and gave her a quick peck. Bergin and Carolyn were estranged, but she waited for him at the elevator.""

I just want to share that at the time of the Pools party, Carolyn was NOT Michael’s girlfriend as the photographer mentioned they were ‘estranged’. Michael himself was involved with another woman—whom he refers to as “Rachel Critelli” in his book—and that relationship continued for seven more months. Despite this, he wrote in his book that he repeatedly questioned Carolyn about her relationship with John. He was in absolutely no position to be asking Carolyn questions about her relationship with John. He wasn’t her boyfriend.  Meanwhile, John was just beginning his official relationship with Daryl Hannah after her split from Jackson Browne. So that peck on the cheek was nothing and Michael proved that he was a jealous control freak by acting like it was.

The idea that Michael was some kind of chivalrous protector for Carolyn is so wrong. By his own account, he was questioning Carolyn about her past at a time when they were not in a committed relationship, and when he himself was still dating someone else. Carolyn owed him nothing. Becoming upset over something as minor as a friendly peck on the cheek and confronting Carolyn about it and then getting upset is crazy work. 

Carolyn had known John longer than she had known Michael, and there’s no indication she interrogated Michael about his own girlfriend Rachel. The narrative that portrays Michael as an innocent, small-town romantic who was deeply wronged is also false. Carolyn was never in a committed relationship with him ever. We don’t even know Carolyn’s perspective on her relationship with Michael, we’ve only heard his side of the story. Without her voice, the account is inherently incomplete. Most people would agree that if a past relationship or situationship were described solely from an ex’s point of view, it likely wouldn’t capture the full truth or complexity of what actually happened.",25,1771294698.0,JohnAndCarolyn,8,0.93,False

1r6tiuh,https://i.redd.it/tf1lk6ezryjg1.jpeg,Making $1+ daily with Crinkl,"I've been using a new receipt scanning app called Crinkl over the last few months and I'm close to making around $1 a day just from scanning my receipts. You can see in the image I shared that I cashed out my points just a few days ago and am already back up to $3.56

In fact, I calculated that my coffee I brew in the morning is about 20 cents and with my bonuses and receipts, I am making over that just from 1 receipt.

A few things I like about Crinkl compared to other rewards apps:

1. It's more private

Deletes all data from their servers after 45 days and companies can only access your anonymous data. In other words, companies only know that someone bought their product in your city, they don't know anything more than that.

2. There are multiple ways to earn

Besides scanning receipts, you can also earn from referrals, in app quests, climbing the leaderboard, and forming a daily scan streak(you can see mine is at 77 right now)

3. Your points never expire

Unlike a lot of rewards apps that are time sensitive. Your points never expire and can be cashed out to CashApp whenever you want.

Overall if you're using any receipt scanning apps or other rewards apps, Crinkl is a no brainer to add to the rotation.

I figured he had second thoughts on the coffee. Then he also cancels the five guys order and I'm no longer on the hook to deliver to him. 

What circumstances does this happen? Do customers just change their mind? Do they try to cheat the system thinking if they cancel mid delivery they'll get their money back and free food? Or did they just decide I could use a coffee and a burger? And don't customers get charged for cancelling mid delivery? I'm a little confused, but I gladly took the free food home with me.

The issue is that, I’ve completely lost my appetite. I think it might be because I have this girl constantly on my mind. Before this, I was eating three meals a day without any problem. Now it’s 8pm and I still haven’t felt hungry at all. In fact, the thought of eating almost makes me feel sick.

For the past few days, all I’ve had is coffee, water, and maybe 2 - 3 chicken drumsticks per day.

It seems like I'm doing okay though, I have lots of energy all day (until I eventually eat something after a long sprint of no food).

Wanted to throw something out there that's been a real lifesaver for me, especially with my day job eating up so much mental bandwidth.

I've been using this service called EssayShark for a while now, not for like, cheating on homework or anything (definitely not), but more for when I need to get some really specific, well-researched content drafted quickly. Think of it less as 'writing for me' and more like 'getting a solid first draft to iterate on' or 'deep dive research packaged up'. It's been huge for freeing up my time to focus on the creative stuff I actually *want* to write, instead of getting bogged down in the more technical, less exciting pieces.

Like, I had this massive report due for a side project, super niche topic, and I just couldn't dedicate the hours to it. I basically outsourced the initial data compilation and structuring through them, and it saved me probably 10-15 hours right off the bat. The ROI on that was insane for my sanity. It's not perfect, you still gotta review and tweak, but it's a hell of a head start.
