My name is Timo, I'm 24, originally from Germany, and currently studying Sustainability Management at NTNU in Norway. This July, I‚Äôm heading to Brisbane to start my exchange semester at QUT ‚Äî super excited! I‚Äôll be arriving on the 11th of July and plan to stay for a few months.

I‚Äôve found a few apartments that could work long-term, but I was advised to inspect them in person instead of relying on video tours. So I‚Äôm currently looking for a place to crash for a few days when I first arrive ‚Äî just something short-term to get settled and check out the housing options.

I figured this could also be a great way to meet someone local and make a meaningful connection right away. I‚Äôm easy-going, love to cook and bake (I‚Äôd be more than happy to make you a meal or two!), and I‚Äôm very passionate about coffee ‚Äî I even travel with my own little setup. I‚Äôm also into all kinds of sports, always down for a run, a swim, or whatever you're into.

If you have a couch, a spare room, or even just some local tips, I‚Äôd really appreciate it. Looking forward to getting to know Brisbane and hopefully someone awesome from the start :)

If you're open to hosting, I‚Äôd love to do a short video call beforehand ‚Äî just to say hi and see if the vibe feels right for both of us :)

Thanks so much!

I've gone off and on caffeine for years. I have anxiety so I know it's not good for me. What I keep coming back to is how much I love the smell and taste of coffee. I know part of that is the addictive nature of caffeine. I do decaf too sometimes, but of course that's not totally caffeine-free either. (and making my own cold brew decaf takes a ton of grounds and is messy...I have never found decaf cold brew in stores)

I'm autistic and I love my bland foods but I'm also obsessed with very strong tastes. I love the taste of cold brew concentrate, and I drink it at full strength. It is so bitter and rich! Plus, no calories. 

But it's expensive, and of course, combined with the addictive nature of caffeine and how the taste is addictive to me, it's not a good choice for me. 

I can find other strong flavors to entertain me (I'm thinking of Swedish salty licorice), but nothing's quite like cold brew concentrate.

The man who saved me, held me, kissed me like I mattered, turned out to be someone else.

I married the wrong brother.

Now I‚Äôm trapped between two men‚Äîone I thought I loved, and one I can‚Äôt trust.

Secrets fester behind every smile, and I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs lying or who‚Äôs just broken.

But one thing‚Äôs for sure‚Äîthis marriage started with a lie.

And when the truth explodes, someone‚Äôs going to burn.‚Äù

**üîûMAKE SURE YOU ARE OVER 18üëá**

**Chapter 1**

For the 99th time, my husband Daryl Norton asked me for a divorce-this time, so he could marry my sister Cassie Kerr.

He set the freshly printed divorce papers on the table and fixed me with a sharp, unyielding stare.

""Della, let's get divorced. Cassie tried to kill herself because of you!""

My eyes burned, but I couldn't help scoffing. ""Jumping off the second floor counts as a suicide attempt now?""

Only I knew the truth. Cassie wasn't trying to die-she was just frustrated I hadn't agreed to the divorce yet, so she staged a scene.

For the past year, she'd acted like the perfect, delicate, well-bred woman in front of everyone-everyone but me. I'd seen her real face more times than I could count, and it made my skin crawl.

""Della-!""

Daryl suddenly lunged and grabbed me by the throat. ""This marriage was just a business arrangement. And you're no longer the Kerr family's heiress. Sign it!""

It felt like someone had driven a knife straight into my chest.

Daryl had a woman he owed his life to-someone he kept helping again and again. People whispered she might be his mistress. My parents-no, my adoptive parents-had once confronted her in secret, furious. But the more they talked, the warmer they became toward her. A DNA test later, and it turned out-she was their biological daughter.

When I didn't respond, Daryl tightened his grip. ""You think if Cassie dies, you get to keep being Mrs. Norton? Stay the Kerr family's little princess?""

I never once tried to hurt her. Cassie knew how to cry, how to act. She threw herself down the stairs and said I pushed her. She fell into the pool-she can't even swim-and blamed me. She tripped over her own feet and still found a way to make it my fault.

Everyone thought I was insane. A monster. But I'd been wronged too.

With red-rimmed eyes, I stared at him. ""Why won't you believe me? Not even once? I didn't do it.""

He let out a cold laugh, seething. ""Still making excuses? Even your adoptive parents can't stand the sight of you. If you had the slightest sense of guilt, they wouldn't regret raising you all these years.""

I lifted my head slightly, blinking back tears. After everything, I was just so tired. Three years of marriage, and he'd never even touched me once.

'Why didn't I wake up sooner?' I thought. 'Wouldn't I be better off living my own life?'

My breathing grew shallow, but I didn't fight back. I just looked at him with a bitter smile. ""You want a divorce? Fine. I'll give you what you want.""

Daryl froze, eyeing me with suspicion. ""What game are you playing now?""

But his grip loosened.

I shoved him away, opened the drawer in the coffee table, and pulled out a pen. I picked up the divorce papers. He'd included two villas as compensation-maybe out of guilt, maybe just pity, now that I had nothing left.

But I didn't need his charity. I crossed out that line without hesitation and, under his shocked gaze, signed my name.

He frowned. ""If you take that out, how are you going to survive?""

I capped the pen and slid it back into the drawer. I didn't even look at him as I stood up. ""Even if I have to beg on the streets, it's none of your concern. Everything you ever gave me just makes me sick.""

Daryl's face darkened instantly, his glare sharp as a blade and fixed on me.

""Della, do you really think pulling a stunt like this will change the way I see you? If it weren't for Cassie coming back, I might've actually believed you were a good wife. I never imagined I'd marry a woman with a heart as poisonous as yours.""

I suddenly laughed-loud, bitter, unstoppable. Tears spilled from my eyes, no longer held back. But instead of softening, his expression only grew colder. He'd seen me cry too many times to care.

Just as he opened his mouth to throw more insults, his phone rang. I watched him answer without a second's hesitation.

""Cassie,"" he said.

I couldn't make out what the caller was saying, but I saw his face darken further. He cast a chilling glance in my direction, though his voice remained calm. ""I'll be right there.""

The moment he hung up, he came at me like a storm. I instinctively stepped back, heart pounding, but he suddenly raised his hand-

Smack.

The sting exploded across my cheek, and I stared at him, furious. ""Daryl, what the hell is wrong with you?""

His fists were clenched so tightly his knuckles cracked. He spoke through gritted teeth, ""You stall me with fake promises about the divorce, then send Lela to attack her? Della, if anything happens to Cassie, I swear I'll make you pay with your life!""

**Chapter 2**

I froze. 'Lela. stood up for me?' I wondered.

Lela Arnold was my best friend-my only friend. The only person who stayed by my side through all of this. The Kerr family, the Norton family. they ate people alive. I'd been terrified she'd get dragged into this mess.

Panic surged through me, and I scrambled to call her. But before I could dial, Daryl yanked my wrist. ""You're coming with me to the hospital. And if you don't want Lela's whole family to suffer, you'll make sure she apologizes to Cassie.""

""You-!"" I was shaking with rage, but he didn't care. He shoved me roughly into the car and slammed the door behind me, then got in and sped off without a word.

In the back seat, I quickly called Lela. She picked up almost immediately.

""Lela, are you at Cassie's hospital room?""

""How'd you know? That bastard Daryl told you, didn't he?"" she snapped, her voice already boiling with anger.

I went rigid. ""Please. just step outside. I'm on my way.""

""Why are you even coming? You should've stayed out of it. I'm going to tear that fake little bitch apart today!""

""Lela, no! Please, just listen to me this once. Wait for me, okay?""

She paused. I could hear the tension in her silence, but after a moment, she sighed. ""Fine. I'll wait outside.""

I hung up.

From the driver's seat, Daryl looked at me through the rearview mirror and scoffed. ""Don't think Lela sticking up for you is going to change anything. Cassie's not going to stop this divorce. Della, I've had enough of you for a long time.""

I gave a low, dry laugh. ""Yeah? Well, I've had enough of you too, Daryl. Let's see who walks away first.""

His face went cold, but he didn't have a comeback. After a moment, he gave a scornful laugh. ""Let's hope you keep that same energy.""

We drove the rest of the way in silence.

I couldn't stop looking at him.

Before Cassie came back, he gave me everything-bags, jewelry, clothes-whatever a rich wife could want. But once she returned and started poisoning his mind, I wasn't even allowed to stand beside him at public events anymore.

I smiled faintly.

'Finally. it's over,' I thought.

Half an hour later, we arrived at the hospital.

Neither of us said a word. We stepped out of the elevator-and then I heard it.

A scream of pain pierced through the hallway. My face went pale. Something was wrong.

Chapter 2 Apologize

I hurried forward, rounded the corner-and there was Lela, sitting on the ground, one hand pressed to her head in pain.

""Lela!""

I rushed over and helped her up, my heart aching as I looked her over. ""Are you okay? Did you hit your head? Should we get you checked out?""

She gave me a small smile and shook her head. ""I'm fine. The floor's just rock hard-it hurt, but nothing serious. No broken bones.""

But the moment she turned and saw Daryl approaching, face dark and thunderous, her smile twisted into a sneer.

""Oh, look who it is. Backing up your precious mistress again, huh, Daryl?""

My chest tightened. I instinctively grabbed Lela's arm. The Arnold family might have some status in the city, but compared to the Norton family and Kerr family, they were still a tier below. I opened my mouth to de-escalate, but Daryl's icy glare locked onto Lela, and his voice dropped to a chilling low.

""If anything happens to her, both of you can answer for it.""

He didn't wait for a reply-just turned and strode straight into the hospital room.

I couldn't help letting out a quiet, bitter laugh. 'He really does care about that manipulative little thing,' I thought.

""You can still laugh?"" Lela muttered, rubbing her lower back as she shot me a glare full of frustration. ""Seriously, I have no idea what you ever saw in him. He's trash, Della. The moment something happens to Cassie, he loses all sense and dumps it on you without a second thought. Can't you just-have a little pride? You-""

She raised a finger, clearly about to scold me with a flick to the forehead, but I cut in with a soft smile. ""I signed the divorce papers.""

Her hand froze mid-air. She stared at me, stunned. ""You're not kidding?""

I shook my head firmly. ""No. I'm done-for real this time.""

She instantly lit up, clapping me hard on the shoulder in excitement. ""Yes! That's what I'm talking about! You're finally out! Tonight, I'm dragging you to the club-time to meet some hot, drama-free boys.""

I chuckled, but still frowned with worry. ""But seriously. what happened in there?""

Jan 23 of 2023 my wife had gastric bypass after going through knee replacement surgery that previous December.  The Dr came out to the waiting room to talk to me, first question out of my mouth was ""can she have coffee"" he said yes. I said thank God. She had been in a foul mood for 2 weeks without coffee. Later that day I grab my instant coffee and proceed to go make a cup. It should be known that I stayed with her everytime she was at the hospital. She got upset because I didn't tell her that I already talked to the Dr and then the dietician came in and I asked if she could have creamer and she said yes but it has to be sugar free. Well what luck I had sugar free creamer and artificial sweetener because I'm diabetic. So I go and fix her a cup of hazelnut coffee with sugar free chocolate creamer. I watch with great happiness when she took that first sip and smiled. It's bringing tears to my eyes just typing this out. This is my first post to reddit and I wanted it to be here.

Everything felt a bit off. The matches didn‚Äôt lead to much, just endless dry convos that died after two ‚Äúheys‚Äù and a ‚Äúwyd.‚Äù I even had one guy ask me if I‚Äôd be open to a ‚ÄúTinder-only situationship,‚Äù whatever that means. I deleted it again after five days. Felt like a total waste of time.

Out of frustration, I tried out a few others. Hinge wasn‚Äôt bad, I actually went on two decent dates from there, but it still had that kind of ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs just browsing like it‚Äôs a shopping app‚Äù vibe. Bumble felt a little more intentional, but I honestly got tired of always having to make the first move. Plus, the responses were sometimes just as lazy as on Tinder.

I‚Äôve heard a lot of people mentioning lesser-known apps lately that aren‚Äôt just carbon copies of Tinder. Some folks swear by things like Coffee Meets Bagel or even niche ones like Thursday or Feeld (which sounds intense lol). I'm just trying to find something that feels more human, you know? Where people actually want to meet and connect without all the weird energy.

So Reddit, what‚Äôs your go-to in 2025 for dating apps that aren‚Äôt Tinder? Anything out there that actually feels like people are serious or at least not just swiping out of boredom?",1,1751399485.0,casualdating,0,1.0,False

The story follows the daughter of an army commander who infiltrates enemy territory due to her unique ability to lie (lying is magically restricted, in this world). In doing so, she gets tangled in a relationship with the enemy commander's son, who want to use her magic for his own agenda. 

Spice level is maybe a 3.5/5. 

Main tropes are fated mates & forced proximity. 



First 300 words:

Cove knew before she‚Äôd even entered her father‚Äôs office that she was in for a crack to her knuckles.

She *had* tried on the official wedding attire that had been hanging untouched in the back of her closet all month‚Äîtruly, she had. The garish blue fabric had clung in odd wrinkles on her breasts and hips, clearly designed for regal modesty instead of elegance, and the heeled leather boots made her look as if she were preparing for a hike and not a party.

Besides, it was merely *encouraged* that soldiers wear the uniform at Ashen weddings. The only issue was that for Cove‚Äôs father‚ÄîAschroft‚Äôs Archon‚Äîencouraged might as well have meant mandatory*.*

Cove sucked in an anticipatory breath before pushing through the door to her father‚Äôs study.

Tucked in the heart of Ashcroft‚Äôs tallest mountain, the army‚Äôs Archon‚Äîa word carried on from the old language, loosely translating to *leader*‚Äîhad an office spacious enough to live inside. His large, pine desk encompassed the entire back of the room, with bookshelves lining the walls on both sides. To the left, a small reception area for the various Prefects who visited for coffee, planning, and other meetings important enough to be conducted in the Archon‚Äôs private chambers*.* To the right, a large map on a table, littered with parchments and pieces meant to represent the three armies.

Cove had spent hours at that table as a child, moving the little pieces around like it were some sort of game‚Äîravens, waves, and horses. She‚Äôd make up a story for them, humming under her breath as she played, while her father held important meetings with important people around her. While a war raged on that she, as the Archon‚Äôs youngest child and only daughter, need never be a part of.

Like many things in the last decade, *that* had changed quickly.",1,1751399437.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False

I lived in Wellington for about 6 months during the Covid period in 2020. It was a weird and quiet time, and drawing became my way of processing things and feeling more connected to the city.

Most days I‚Äôd sit in coffee shops and sketch: the people, the atmosphere, the interiour. I ended up with 24 drawings from different caf√©s around the city.

Later, I put them together into a small illustrated ebook, added photos I took during my trip and texts I wrote about the coffeeshops and the coffee culture in New Zealand. And so it became a book I called:

‚ÄúWellington‚Äôs Coffeeshops ‚Äì 24 Illustrations with Impressions from the Capital of New Zealand‚Äù

It‚Äôs basically a visual journal from that time. Sharing a few pages here in case anyone‚Äôs interested or recognizes some of the spots. Would love to hear what your favourite caf√©s in Wellington are too.

If you're curious, the full ebook is available here:

1lpbcsr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lpbcsr,Current Rotation before July Rotation drops,"I‚Äôve had SEY once before years ago. But this is my first time buying from each of the roasters pictured. Each of these is unique in their own way, but the washed coffees from these specialty roasters really shine. For the most part I grind pretty course (7 to 8 on Pietro Pro) use a hybrid recipe with Hario Switch. Been using 15g coffee > 60g bloom with switch open until 1 min > QS up to 250g with switch closed until 2:15-2:30, draw down is usually done around 4 min.

La Llanda (Sidra) from La Cabra is very floral, I get notes of jasmine, earthy. My wife gets tomato, grassy.

Typica from Jose Jijon super unique cup, maybe one of the best washed coffees I‚Äôve had. I think I‚Äôve dialed this in just right and the tasting notes are all on point: Prickly pear, honey dew and rose. I get more Prickly Pear than anything.

Washed Gesha from Raquel Lasso. Recommended rest time is 4 weeks. Today marks 3 weeks and I‚Äôm impatient so brewed a cup. This is a complex yet clean, layered cup. Lots of red fruit, sweet, followed by florals as it cools, I get rose water. I‚Äôm excited to let this one rest and open up some more. It‚Äôs already very good.

Thai passion fruit coferment from Newberry St. maybe I‚Äôve just been wowed from the washed coffees and also need to let this open up some more (Roasted 6/18). But I‚Äôve only brewed 1 cup. For a coferment it‚Äôs not in your face, very subtle which I appreciate. I had a hard time pulling notes, maybe a bit darker roasted for my liking. Will come back to this one in a week or 2.

Not pictured is the decaf from Newberry St. I‚Äôm very impressed, super fruity. I may be trying more from them.

With all of that being said, I think I‚Äôm going to stop buying coferments for a while (outside of what may come from future subscriptions). DD can you get SEY and/or Moonwake on Coffee rotation?! Not slept on roasters but they do a really good job",2,1751399018.0,coffeerotation,0,1.0,False

1lpbal6,https://i.redd.it/62m1hbu1gbaf1.png,Weird tasting decaf,"Hi all! New user here. I recently got an aluminum moka pot and have had great tasting coffee using Douwe Egberts (Dutch brand) Aroma Rood regular coarse ground coffee. I have an electric stove. I used the hot water method, low heat on the stove, did not tamp my grounds or anything, everything went fine and the coffee was amazing. Rich, a bit sweet, not bitter or watery.

I've wanted to try decaf, and the only one I could find in the store that wasn't too finely ground (I thought) is Northern Wonder Coffee Free Coffee medium roast filter blend. I used the same method as the regular coffee, same amount of water, same amount of grounds. The process went very differently, a lot of pressure built up in the water compartment without any coffee coming out the collection chamber. It took a lot longer for the coffee to come out eventually. I took it off the stove because of the high pressure, before any gurgling sounds or something like that. And the taste is very weird, not really bitter but a bit acidic, and has a kind of oily aspect to it.

Now I was wondering what went wrong. If maybe the decaf is too finely ground still (being filter blend), did I use a wrong amount of water or grounds? Is it just the fact that it's decaf that makes it taste like this?
I hope I used the correct terms. Any advice is appreciated!",3,1751398875.0,mokapot,1,1.0,False

Hi all,

Yonder is a lifestyle credit / debit card (you choose) which provides points to spend on ‚Äòexperiences‚Äô such as restaurant meals, flights, hotels, coffee, beer at pubs, flowers, delivery food services, trips away (such as log cabins and Wellness retreats) and much more -**it changes every month**!

If you sign up via my referral link (here:¬†https://join.yondercard.com/bhdfbyx) you will get 10,000 points (worth approximately¬†**¬£50 in credit**¬†towards various experiences, dependent on experience chosen, in cities of London, Manchester, Birmingham Bristol and Bath, or towards the¬†**online experiences**¬†such as flights, food deliveries, flower deliveries etc - therefore can be used in any city, no matter where you live!).

Some good examples of redemptions I've personally used / I am planning on:

* Fancy massage parlour
* Various restaurants for lunches and dinner
* Ocean Bottle (akin to Chilly's) as a gift
* Freddie's Flowers

On top of this, some other perks of the card and referral include:

* you will be able to claim 3 months¬†*premium*¬†membership for¬†**free**¬†which provides¬†**worldwide family travel insurance**¬†when booking travel on the card and also 5 points per ¬£1 spent.
* From my rough calculations, this correlates to somewhere in the region of 2 to 3% cash back dependent on the experience
* You‚Äôll also be able to get Mastercard foreign exchange fees (i.e essentially the best fees you can get when abroad, akin to cards like Chase/Monzo/Revolut) and purchase protection, which is a¬†**huge perk**¬†and means you can get 2-3% cash back on¬†**holiday spends**!

To sign up, you can go through the referral link (or any referral link!) and follow the steps.

**Application Process**¬†(Including Hard Credit Check)

1. Download Yonder App using the¬†[referral link](https://join.yondercard.com/bhdfbyx)
2. Verify Your Email & Details: Provide accurate information for verification.
3. Give some initial info and it performs a soft credit check to determine if you are eligible. If not, it will say so, so no need for a hard check.
4. Link Your Main Bank Accounts: This step ensures Yonder can offer you an appropriate credit limit.
5. Complete Identity Check: Take a quick selfie and provide a valid government-issued ID.
6. Undergo a Hard Credit Check: As with any credit card application, a hard check will be performed on your credit report.
7. Done

You can also cancel before the 3 months premium ends to avoid the subscription renewing and once you‚Äôve spent all the points on experiences, and switch to a free card or just cancel the card.

On the whole I‚Äôm really enjoying Yonder and hope you will too! I‚Äôm enjoying so much so that I‚Äôm I've continued using the subscription after my first 3 months premium free (and I also use it on top of my AMEX). The nice thing is it tends to be¬†**accepted everywhere**¬†that AMEX is not (because it's Mastercard) and you can spend abroad without a transaction fee.

1lpb8m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1lpb8m4/trenta_manager_rant/,trenta manager rant,"i know i know a ton of people rant abt their managers but ive been GOING THRU IT and i really would like some outside sources to tell me if im being too sensitive.  

I started working at starbucks last november, i trained at a different store than i was hired at due to availability of the trainers. I was trained in a cafe only store and i loved it! the store i work at is the only drive thru coffee shop within 20ish miles. its pretty high volume and i actually was scheduled to work two coverage shifts while i was still training bc of this busyness. this struck me as odd but i didn‚Äôt really think anything of it. when i started working i was mainly opening and it seemed like the SM really liked my work ethic, i was never late, i got a long with everyone in the store and i accepted any and all coaching. in fact the SM was already talking about how amazing i would be as a shift lead, even tho thats not something i want. 

then in january i called out bc i was throwing up and coughing a ton, i had strep, so i missed a week. i went back to work and less than a month later i got an upper respiratory infection that i tried to work thru which ended up turning into pneumonia. i was out for another week. i came back and my SM was giving me the cold shoulder. she wasn‚Äôt communicating with me, she wouldn‚Äôt coach me verbally (when i missed writing on a drink she just took it away from handoff, set it in front of me and walked away), and she was allegedly complaining about me calling out when it was ‚Äújust pneumonia‚Äù. she ended up snapping at me for asking to use the bathroom during peak and a few weeks later i had to call out due to being in the ER with a uti that turned into a kidney infection (i‚Äôm not blaming the infection on her but she does her best to prevent partners to go to the bathroom during peak. she thinks you should use the bathroom on your breaks only) she didn‚Äôt text me once to check on me she asked when i would be back to work and then when i walked into my shift she said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not going to get to go home early i hope you know that‚Äù and then when i showed up again the next day she went back to basically ignoring me. she has made it very apparent that she doesn‚Äôt accept call outs for any reason, even if you‚Äôre sick, bc ‚Äúif it‚Äôs not a fever of over 101 and you don‚Äôt have covid or food poisoning you should still come to work and let us decide if you can handle it‚Äù 

ever since that last time i came back to work nothing has been the same, she makes an example out of everything i do. i‚Äôve been front or DTO every shift for the past two months, she refuses to set up meetings with me to discuss anything, she accused me of gossip when i asked someone other than her a question about a customer, she communicates with me on the floor by huffing and puffing instead of talking and she just generally doesn‚Äôt like me. she‚Äôs denied THREE schedule availability requests for no reason. im not the only one she treats like this but it is glaringly obvious im a main problem in her day. the rest of the store has noticed this and have tried to get me to document things and call ethics and compliance but she already has two different ethics complaints against her and nothing has happened, i also don‚Äôt want to be the reason she gets fired. she frequently talks about how she goes into work everyday scared that she‚Äôs gonna lose her job, or be written up *AGAIN* by the DM. 

she gave me a documented coaching today for calling out 5 times in the last 6 weeks. she told me that im no longer reliable and that people in the store talk amongst themselves about if im actually going to show up to shifts. i just enrolled in ASU and she told me ‚Äúit would be such a shame if something were to take that away‚Äù and then said she comes into work and fears for her job everyday so it‚Äôs time for me to be accountable. it was a really strange conversation. i‚Äôm not denying that i called out more frequently than normal but i‚Äôve been having insane anxiety and throwing up before my shifts or getting horrible migraines at the thought of interacting with her. i can‚Äôt even get treated like a human when she‚Äôs not on the floor or working, she comes into for a drink and just ignores me. i‚Äôm at my wits end. i‚Äôve put up with a lot but im scared that this is how every starbucks is and that i‚Äôll never get out of this situation no matter which one i work at. i love my coworkers and i want to keep going to school but i hate going to work. what should i do?

1lpb8iv,https://i.redd.it/erlw6ehifbaf1.png,Caught Living with My Boss Available,"**Hit the comments if you're ready to read more!**

I was publicly criticized by my manager during the staff meeting.  
  
He said someone had reported me for having a poor work attitude and demanded I explain myself immediately.  
  
My face was plastered across the giant screen at the meeting like a public execution.  
  
Just as I was spiraling into panic, our boss‚ÄîLucas Jackson‚Äîappeared on my camera feed. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the issue? Let me hear it.‚Äù  
  
‚Ä¶  
  
‚ÄúDear residents, please be advised that due to a reported case of infectious disease in the community, the area is now under quarantine. Please remain calm. Property management will soon send staff to conduct door-to-door inspections. I repeat...‚Äù  
  
I stood outside Lucas‚Äôs house, clenched my teeth, and rang the doorbell.  
  
The door swung open. Lucas stood there in a bathrobe, looking as handsome as ever, but also visibly annoyed. ‚ÄúWhat is it now?‚Äù  
  
I‚Äôd already disturbed his shower once when I came to deliver documents.  
  
Now I was interrupting his bath time again.  
  
I sneaked a glance at the bit of chest muscle peeking out from his robe. ‚ÄúUm... management said the community is under lockdown. No one is allowed in or out.‚Äù  
  
Lucas raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúSo?‚Äù  
  
I plastered on a smile. ‚ÄúSo, Mr. Jackson, would it be alright if I‚Ä¶ stayed at your place for a few days?‚Äù  
  
This high-end community‚Äôs property management was ruthless. They said during the quarantine, visitors could only stay at the community hotel.  
  
A hundred a night. No negotiations.  
  
Lucas might be annoying, but next to that 100-dollar-a-night price tag, he suddenly seemed quite charming.  
  
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Lucas replied coldly and immediately tried to shut the door.  
  
I grabbed the handle and shouted, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do this! I‚Äôve dedicated myself to you and the company! You can‚Äôt just abandon me‚Äî‚Äù  
  
Right then, an old lady walked by with her dog. She saw the scene and couldn‚Äôt help but chime in, ‚ÄúYoung man, take some responsibility! Don‚Äôt be a scumbag!‚Äù  
  
Through the narrow gap I was clinging to, I clearly saw Lucas‚Äôs face.Yeah, he's hot, but he looked pissed.  
  
Perhaps unable to handle the moral judgment from his neighbor, Lucas finally let me in.  
  
I sat on the couch in the living room while Lucas‚Äînow changed into casual clothes‚Äîsat across from me, radiating low-pressure vibes.  
  
‚ÄúYou can stay,‚Äù he said, still not looking too pleased, ‚Äúbut not for free.‚Äù  
  
He added, ‚ÄúNormally I have a maid come in daily to clean and cook. But now with the lockdown, she can‚Äôt get in. From now on, that‚Äôs your job.‚Äù  
  
I nodded quickly. ‚ÄúGot it! No problem. Leave it to me!‚Äù  
  
Lucas‚Äôs expression finally softened a bit.  
  
I wasn‚Äôt exactly experienced with chores, but thankfully Lucas‚Äôs place was equipped with user-friendly tools, so nothing major went wrong.  
  
Until‚ÄîI stepped into the kitchen.  
  
I‚Äôd only just graduated and usually ate at the company cafeteria. I hadn‚Äôt tried cooking on my own before.  
  
But I was confident‚Äî*it‚Äôs just cooking.* Throw in some of this, add some of that, stir and fry. How hard could it be?  
  
I spent two hours watching cooking videos online, pulled a dozen ingredients from the fridge, and got ready to show off my skills.  
  
But the moment flames leapt from the stovetop, everything spiraled out of control.  
  
In my panic, I accidentally turned up the heat. The oil in the pan flared up with a loud whoosh.  
  
Just as I stood frozen in front of the flaming pan, unsure what to do, a strong hand wrapped around my waist and pulled me back.  
  
It was Lucas.  
  
I stared at his broad back, dazed.  
  
He swiftly turned off the stove and covered the flaming pan with a lid.  
  
Then he turned to look at me.  
  
*I‚Äôm doomed.*  
  
Jane from the secretarial team once got fired just for bringing him coffee with her left hand.  
  
After that, everyone in that team kept their distance from Lucas, afraid of getting fired over the tiniest mistake.  
  
No one wanted to take the job of delivering this document. It‚Äôd been passed around until it landed on me.  
  
And now I‚Äôd nearly set his house on fire. I was definitely getting fired.  
  
As I stood there on edge, Lucas finally spoke. ‚ÄúAre you hurt?‚Äù  
  
I shook my head, feeling sorry.  
  
He sighed. ‚ÄúForget it. Just don‚Äôt let it happen again.‚Äù  
  
I looked up, stunned.  
  
*That‚Äôs it?* *Just don‚Äôt let it happen again?*  
  
Lucas was being so forgiving! Not at all like the cold-hearted boss everyone made him out to be!  
  
I was moved and guilty at the same time. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Mr. Jackson. I‚Äôm just not very skilled yet. Let me try a few more times!‚Äù  
  
He ignored me, shoved me out of the kitchen with a grim expression, and decided to cook himself.  
  
Watching him roll up his sleeves, he looked so stoic and composed‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt help but sneak a few glances.  
  
Even wearing an apron with a Tom and Jerry cartoon on it, Lucas still looked ridiculously attractive.  
  
Thank goodness for Lucas. After everything I put him through, he still forgave me and let me eat his cooking.  
  
He was a surprisingly good cook. I couldn‚Äôt resist getting a second helping. While eating, I gave him a thumbs-up. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre amazing!‚Äù  
  
Lucas‚Äôs expression finally lightened a bit.  
  
Though he still sounded annoyed. ‚ÄúSlow down. No one‚Äôs fighting you for it.‚Äù  
  
From that point on, the kitchen was officially Lucas‚Äôs domain.  
  
Three days flew by in a flash.  
  
Today was our monthly staff meeting. Every department head had to give a report.  
  
Since I couldn‚Äôt go to the office due to quarantine, I applied to attend the meeting via video call.  
  
I was half-asleep, propping my chin up while listening to the VP‚Äôs opening remarks.  
  
Usually, these meetings were just for upper management. They had nothing to do with me.  
  
But when it came time for my manager, Tammy, to speak, she called me out by name!  
  
Her sharp voice rang out. ‚ÄúRecently, someone reported that a staff member falsely claimed to be quarantined and applied to work from home. But in reality, that‚Äôs not true! It is extremely inappropriate and has set a bad example! Claire Spencer, explain yourself! Now!‚Äù  
  
I looked up, stunned, and saw my sleepy face displayed on the big screen.  
  
I jolted upright. ‚ÄúMadam Tammy, I‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt lie‚Ä¶ The place I‚Äôm in is definitely under quarantine‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúStill trying to deny it?‚Äù Tammy snapped.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôve already checked! The only neighborhood under quarantine these past two days is Silverwood Heights! Are you saying you live in Silverwood Heights? Our boss lives there. Are you saying you‚Äôre neighbors with Mr. Jackson?‚Äù  
  
I was suddenly nervous, unsure how to defend myself.  
  
I was just an ordinary office worker. Silverwood Heights was a well-known luxury neighborhood. If I were Tammy, I wouldn‚Äôt believe someone like me lived there either.  
  
Tammy sneered. It seemed like the perfect time for her to dish out my punishment, but then she suddenly choked, sputtering and lost for words.  
  
I froze too, staring blankly at the man who suddenly appeared on the screen.  
  
Lucas stood there in his bathrobe, lazily leaning against my door. ‚ÄúClaire, where‚Äôs the underwear I left in the bathroom?‚Äù

I am living with my aunt and uncle temporarily since my uncle is a disabled veteran although he is doing much better now, but I eventually plan on getting my own house either by the end of the year or early next year as long as everything keeps going according to plan!

So what else can I say about myself? Well I am very much a workaholic, and I am very career driven. To me, the key to being successful and happy is to do something you enjoy work related, and treat every day like it's going to be one of the best. I pretty much always wake up 3 hours before my work shift to try to have a productive morning, whether that's to make myself some breakfast, or clean a bit! It also gives me plenty of time to wake up and have a cup of coffee so that I don't have to come into work in a groggy mood :P I might consider going back to school some day in the future if that means growing my career. Who knows? Whenever I'm not working, which isn't often, I love to play video games, go bowling, occasionally read, and watch sports!

So what am I looking for in someone? Honestly, it doesn't matter to me much. I just want someone to treat right, someone who will give me more than one word answers when I text them, and someone I can love and cherish on a daily basis. Communication is key!

9pm - my batch was weak actually , I apply this after work. This has some coconut smell in it in base notes , soothing and mellow. I don't care if it doesn't project or is beast mode. It is best suited for evening wear , applying this everyday after work. I get whiffs until late night. Will order full bottle and macerate it .8.5 / 10

I will be moving back to the city this fall. I am looking for another roommate or roommates to go apartment hunting with in late August to early September. I prefer female roommates, but am happy to add a male roommate as well if there are at least three of us. 

I work as a bartender and am a night owl, but don‚Äôt mind early birds if you are quiet and considerate. I am not super neat, but like to keep common spaces clean, food items and dishes in the kitchen, and floors clear to prevent pests. I am a weed smoker so I prefer 420 friendly, and am happy to discuss boundaries around smoking. I‚Äôm also queer and like to be involved in the community, so queer friendly please! 

I don‚Äôt host large parties, but do like to have a few friends over sometimes either for hangouts or sleepovers. I‚Äôm open to throwing a party or two as long as everyone is okay with it. I don‚Äôt have a cat but I love cats so if you have one or are open to me getting one that would be great!

I would love a roommate who is happy to hang out once in a while but who doesn‚Äôt need to be best friends as I prefer to keep to myself sometimes. I love going to the movies, live music, going to bookstores, thrift shopping, coffee, smoking üçÉ, making collages, photography, walking, hiking, camping, running, and collecting books and music.

If you think we would be a good fit please private message me!",1,1751398574.0,NYCroommates,0,1.0,False

- Long summer nights make for beautiful dusk scenes like these paddle boarders.
- The obligate morning beach-with-coffee walk had this kayaker out fishing.  
- An eager child learned how to scramble eggs on the camp stove (a Jetboil Genesis). Gear note: the Jetboil Genesis has been amazing all around, but needs a windbreak.  Kitchen from Decathalon; pots by Woods (Canadian Tire). 
- We got in right before the fire ban and enjoyed marshmallows over the fire.

It's a term that's not commonly used throughout discussions about making money is it? But it's near truth if you want to be a *substantially* profitable trader, whether it's through the old reliable Metatrader 5 or behind your bloomberg terminal at the office. 

**Definition:** Trading like water refers to following the money, you've probably heard it in other terms like the trend is your friend and don't trade against the market. However it is much more deeper than that, think of our river rapids that are 12 miles (or kilometers) / *$120+ Trillion Dollars* deep.

Now picture yourself trying to swim upstream in such rapids. It would be *extremely tough* not to mention you'd get swept into the rocks *(your stop losses)*, sometimes you'll catch a break and be able to grab onto something. But the matter of the fact is: **you're going against the current**. 

So, trading profitably is just as simple as flowing down the rapids? **Wrong**. 

You need to develop some key strengths to help navigate these waters. Instead of floating down grab yourself a raft **(your strategy)**, a paddle **(your analysis)**, and lastly a life vest **(your risk management).**

Combine all three with: 
- Identifying market structure, where is it going on the daily timeframe? Check the 4 hourly time frame, is it bouncing or heading somewhere it has gone before?
- Mark out important prices, then sit back and note them down. See how the market comes to these areas and watch what happens. Does it go beyond or before? How can you improve spotting these zones?
- Become comfortable with losing from time to time, nobody is ever a 100%. Losses will happen **(big fucking rocks you can't avoid)** so embrace yourself for them and get back in. The journey is what is important.
- Read books about institutional trading and what they are doing. They're doing the exact same thing you are, looking for the most important areas where they can enter and exit the market profitably. Where would that be? Can you spot those prices? 
- Work on your emotions and try not to chase the **dollar signs $**, at the end of the day money is just numbers in a database. Your goal is to just keep adding and multiplying them, but you have to do so with a clear mind. Be proud of your winners and celebrate them with a small treat for yourself (take yourself for a coffee, grab some lunch with a friend, don't brag, but if asked elaborate) it's about YOU feeling good. Not everyone else.

1lpb513,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthnutrition1/comments/1lpb513/can_vegans_drink_milk_mustknow_info/,Can Vegans Drink Milk? Must-Know Info!,"Can Vegans Drink Milk: Understanding the Options
------------------------------------------------

Many people wonder about the relationship between vegans and milk. If you‚Äôre on a plant-based journey or just curious, it‚Äôs essential to know what options are out there. So, can vegans drink milk? The answer is complex, depending on the type of milk being discussed and the principles of veganism.

Veganism, at its core, is a lifestyle that avoids all animal products. This includes not just meat and fish, but also dairy, eggs, and even honey. Therefore, traditional cow's milk, sheep's milk, or goat's milk is off-limits for most vegans. However, the rise of plant-based diets has led to an exciting range of milk alternatives that allow those who follow a vegan lifestyle to enjoy a similar experience without compromising their values.

### Here are some popular plant-based milk options:

- **Almond Milk:** Made from almonds, this milk is low in calories and has a slightly nutty taste.
- **Soy Milk:** A good source of protein, soy milk is versatile and can be used in both sweet and savory dishes.
- **Oat Milk:** Creamy and naturally sweet, oat milk has surged in popularity in recent years.
- **Coconut Milk:** With its tropical flavor, coconut milk is great for smoothies and desserts.
- **Rice Milk:** This sweet and mild milk is a good option for those with nut allergies and is often easily digestible.
- **Cashew Milk:** Rich and creamy, cashew milk is perfect for adding to coffee or using in recipes.

When choosing a milk alternative, keep in mind your nutritional needs. For example, some plant-based milks, like soy milk, are higher in protein, while almond milk tends to be lower. Many brands fortify their milk alternatives with vitamins and minerals, including calcium and vitamin D. Be sure to check nutrition labels for the best options that fit your dietary requirements.

### Why Do Some Vegans Avoid Certain Alternatives?

While most plant-based milks align with a vegan lifestyle, not all alternatives are created equally. Some brands may add ingredients that are not vegan-friendly or use production processes that don't align with vegan ethics. For example:

- **Additives:** Check for additives like omega-3 fatty acids which can sometimes be derived from fish oil.
- **Sugar:** Some brands use sugar refined with bone char, which is not suitable for vegans.
- **Cross-Contamination:** Facilities that process both plant-based and animal products may lead to cross-contamination.

Ultimately, the decision about which milk to consume lies with the individual. Some may choose to entirely avoid milk alternatives while others may find joy in exploring different plant-based options that fit their lifestyle and preferences.

### What About Milk in Cooking and Baking?

If you're cooking or baking, substituting traditional milk with a plant-based alternative is often straightforward. Just remember that different types of milk have varying flavors and consistencies, which can influence your recipe. Here are some tips for successfully substituting plant-based milks:

- **Baking:** Almond milk or soy milk work well in most baking recipes. Just ensure you use unsweetened versions if you want to keep the sugar levels low.
- **Cooking:** coconut milk can add a creamy touch to soups and curries.
- **Frothing:** Whole soy milk is often preferred for lattes since it froths better than most alternatives.

If you're new to plant-based diets, experimenting with various milk alternatives can be both fun and rewarding. Start by swapping out cow's milk for a variety of plant-based options to see which ones you enjoy. You might find that you prefer the taste and health benefits of non-dairy milks.

[ Get Vegan Warrior: Your Guide to Plant-Based Fitness Here ](https://buy.stripe.com/3cI9ATdnQ6Ubg0d2nt1wY05)  
  
To put it simply, while traditional milk remains off the menu for vegans, there is a wide array of delicious plant-based milks available to enjoy instead. these alternatives into your diet not only aligns with vegan principles but can also diversify your palate and improve your health. The journey to a vegan lifestyle can be an exciting exploration of flavors and nutrition!

The Health Benefits of Plant-Based Milk Alternatives
----------------------------------------------------

Plant-based milk alternatives have gained popularity for their great taste, versatility, and numerous health benefits. Unlike cow's milk, which can be challenging for some individuals to digest, these alternatives offer a variety of options for those looking to embrace a dairy-free lifestyle. Below are the key health benefits associated with incorporating plant-based milk into your daily nutrition.

### Nutrient-Rich Options

Many plant-based milks are fortified, meaning that they have essential vitamins and minerals added to enhance their health benefits. Common nutrients found in these alternatives include:

[ Get Vegan Warrior: Your Guide to Plant-Based Fitness Here ](https://buy.stripe.com/3cI9ATdnQ6Ubg0d2nt1wY05)  
  
- **Calcium:** Essential for strong bones, many brands fortify their milk with calcium, matching the levels found in cow‚Äôs milk.
- **Vitamin D:** Often added to support bone health, vitamin D is crucial for calcium absorption and plays a role in immune function.
- **B Vitamins:** Certain plant-based milks, like soy milk, are rich in B vitamins, which are vital for energy production and brain health.

### Lower in Calories and Fat

Another appealing feature of many plant-based milks is that they are often lower in calories and fat compared to whole cow‚Äôs milk. This makes them a good option for those trying to manage their weight. For example:

- **Almond Milk:** Typically contains less than 40 calories per cup, making it a light choice.
- **Coconut Milk:** While creamy and rich, light versions of coconut milk can be lower in calories than traditional milk.

### Less Risk of Allergies and Lactose Intolerance

If you are one of the many people who experience discomfort from consuming dairy, plant-based milks can provide a safe alternative. Since they are free from lactose, they can be enjoyed without the digestive issues that often accompany dairy products. Furthermore, several types are completely allergen-free, making them suitable for a variety of dietary restrictions. For instance:

- **Oat Milk:** Usually gluten-free and easy to digest for many.

For instance, almond and soy milk can support heart health by potentially reducing cholesterol levels. these options into your diet can contribute to better cardiovascular health, especially when combined with a balanced diet.

### Good for the Environment

Although not a direct health benefit, it's worth mentioning that choosing plant-based milk alternatives can be beneficial for the environment.

Even though Serena Summers was seated in a quiet corner, all eyes were still drawn to her.  
  
But right now‚Äî  
  
Her gaze had fallen on a young server. Among all the bottles in the mini-fridge, he‚Äôd picked *that* one.  
  
As she stared at the server, who kept his head lowered behind a mask, something about him felt familiar.  
  
""You‚Äî""  
  
""If you don‚Äôt need anything else, I‚Äôll step out now. Just call if you need something.""  
  
Behind the mask, Francis Carter was doing everything he could to keep his emotions in check.  
  
There‚Äôs nothing more humiliating than showing up to a class reunion and realizing all your former classmates are now successful in their fields‚Äîwhile you‚Äôre the one serving them drinks.  
  
Especially when one of them... used to be your‚Äî Sugar baby.  
  
Francis shut his eyes, then slowly opened them again.  
  
He was just about to push open the door and leave when‚Äî  
  
""Hey, waiter!""  
  
Ryan Daly, sitting directly across from Serena, suddenly called out, ""Come grab my plate, will you?""  
  
So close.  
  
He was so damn close!  
  
Francis could only watch as the door slowly shut in front of him. It felt like a noble sacrifice as he turned around with his tray and forced out through gritted teeth, ""Of course.""  
  
""Ms. Summers, a toast to you.""  
  
Ryan raised his glass and downed it in one gulp. Then, as if struck by a fun memory, he added,  
  
""Ms. Summers, remember that spoiled rich kid who chased after you back in college?""  
  
""I heard his family went bankrupt during our senior year. He didn‚Äôt even get to graduate. Just dropped out and disappeared.""  
  
""Who knows where he ended up, running around with just a high school diploma.""  
  
The moment those words dropped, everyone else joined in with jeers:  
  
""Make money? Him? The only reason he even got into Glendale University was because of his nouveau riche dad. That guy was a total slacker. No way he ever amounted to anything.""  
  
""Exactly! Used to act like he was better than the rest of us just ‚Äôcause he had some money. Look at him now. Pathetic.""  
  
""Anyone still in touch with him? I bet he has no idea that the girl he bullied the most back in school is now the CEO of the country‚Äôs biggest tech company.""  
  
As if he didn‚Äôt know.  
  
Her first big payday, her first investor, the first product she launched... he knew *everything*.  
  
Francis couldn‚Äôt help glancing at Serena, who remained calm and composed. Her face no longer carried the naivety and shyness of the past. Even when others brought up those humiliating memories, she stayed poised and expressionless.  
  
And yet, she was still stunning.  
  
Back then, it was this face that made him declare to the whole school that she was his‚Äîno one else could touch her. He‚Äôd pursued her relentlessly.  
  
In class, the cafeteria, the library, every part-time job she worked.  
  
*So childish. So immature.*  
  
Because of his obsession, she was warned by professors, scolded by managers, and lost one job after another.  
  
And so, when her grandmother suddenly had a stroke and they couldn‚Äôt afford the hospital bills‚Äî  
  
He took advantage of her desperation and offered...  
  
To ""keep"" her.  
  
*Three hundred thousand.*  
  
The same as what he‚Äôd spend on a jacket. Or a pair of shoes.  
  
But to her, it was everything‚Äîher dignity, her pride.  
  
Back then, Francis didn‚Äôt understand.  
  
Now, he wanted nothing more than to slap himself. There were better ways. There *had* to be. But he had chosen the worst possible one.  
  
She must hate his guts by now.  
  
Even if she looked so calm on the surface.  
  
Sure enough‚Äî  
  
Serena nodded. Her voice was steady, but there was a storm brewing underneath:  
  
""Of course I remember. How could I possibly forget? I spent years trying to track him down after graduation, but he just vanished.""  
  
At that, Ryan jumped in with gusto:  
  
""Damn right! If it were me, I‚Äôd find him too. And make him *pay*!""  
  
The others joined the chorus:  
  
""Exactly! Treated people like trash just because he had money.""  
  
""Who does he think he is?""  
  
""Ms. Summers is a rising star now. The most successful of all of us!""  
  
""Ms. Summers, if your company‚Äôs ever open to collaborations, don‚Äôt forget us old classmates!""  
  
""Yeah, seriously! I always knew back in school you were destined for greatness!""  
  
Compliment after compliment rolled out without thinking.  
  
They weren‚Äôt the hot-blooded, idealistic students they used to be. Life in the workforce had worn down their edges.  
  
Serena wasn‚Äôt just an old classmate anymore‚Äîshe was someone who could change their fate.  
  
Even a crumb from her table could keep them fed for years.  
  
Serena smiled from her throne and casually glanced toward Francis, who stood beside Ryan, head down, quietly collecting the plates. Her voice was light, but carried weight:  
  
""Yeah.""  
  
""I‚Äôd love to see what kind of face he‚Äôd make if he saw me now.""  
  
*No way...*  
  
*She still remembers?!*  
  
Francis' hands trembled as he reached for the plate. The chicken bones tumbled off and rolled onto Ryan‚Äôs lap, leaving greasy streaks on his clothes.  
  
""What the hell is wrong with you?""  
  
Ryan leapt up and glared at Francis. ""You got trash all over me!""  
  
""I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm so sorry!""  
  
Francis quickly pulled out a handkerchief and tried to wipe it off. ""I didn‚Äôt mean to‚Äî""  
  
""Do you even *know* how much this outfit costs?""  
  
Ryan smacked his hand away, face twisted with disdain.  
  
""How many months of your salary is this worth, huh? You tell me‚Äîwhat are you gonna do about it?""  
  
Francis could feel the unspoken looks from everyone in the room‚Äîwaiting for a scene.  
  
But one gaze, calm and without malice, stood out.  
  
He knew exactly whose it was.  
  
*Serena.*  
  
He‚Äôd been humiliated like this before, but this time was different.  
  
A wave of crushing shame washed over him.  
  
His throat was dry.  
  
""I‚Äôm sor‚Äî""  
  
""Mr. Carter.""  
  
Serena spoke up.  
  
""I heard your company just acquired a new piece of property?""  
  
""Oh? I didn‚Äôt think Ms. Summers followed real estate news.""  
  
Ryan immediately lost interest in bickering with a lowly waiter. No matter how angry he was, he wasn‚Äôt stupid‚Äîhow could a server compare to someone like Serena?  
  
Still, he shot one last glare at Francis.  
  
""What are you standing there for?""  
  
""Get lost‚Äî!""  
  
Francis could barely keep his expression neutral behind the mask. He took a deep breath.  
  
""Understood. Call me if you need anything.""  
  
*Click.*  
  
The private room door closed behind him.  
  
Shutting out the sound of Ryan sucking up to Serena.  
  
And cutting off the weight of Serena‚Äôs gaze.  
  
Francis let out a deep breath.  
  
*Sh\*t.*  
  
She definitely recognized him!  
  
Even with the uniform. Even with the mask.  
  
That look she gave him‚Äîit was too direct, too familiar.  
  
The fragile girl from back then would‚Äôve never looked at him like that.  
  
She was different now. Confident. Sharp. Powerful.  
  
And worst of all‚Äî  
  
*She still held a grudge!*  
  
She couldn‚Äôt seriously be planning revenge, could she?  
  
Just the thought made Francis shudder. No way she was that petty!  
  
Back when they were together, it‚Äôs not like he‚Äî  
  
*Okay, fine.*  
  
He did enough to make anyone want to stab him three hundred times.  
  
*No!*  
  
He couldn‚Äôt just sit around and wait to die.  
  
He had to run. Now.  
  
Francis glanced at the time. The dinner rush was over. There were enough staff on duty‚Äîif he left now, it‚Äôd be fine.  
  
He informed his supervisor, changed out of his uniform, and was about to clock out when‚Äî  
  
""Hey, Francis, right?"" the manager called.  
  
""One of the guests had too much to drink. Asked specifically for you to drive them home. Head to the parking garage.""  
  
Francis' gut told him something was off. He was just about to say no when‚Äî  
  
""They‚Äôll pay you eight hundred for the ride.""  
  
*Eight hundred?!*  
  
Now that was a sweet deal!  
  
Eyes lighting up, Francis said, ""I‚Äôm in!""  
  
He repeated the license plate number in his head as he walked to the underground garage.  
  
Black Maybach. 0603.  
  
Same number as his birthday.  
  
*Weird coincidence.*  
  
In the dimly lit garage, Francis spotted the sleek, black Maybach from afar. The curves, the detailing‚Äîeverything screamed luxury.  
  
Ever since his family went bankrupt, he‚Äôd sold all his cars to pay off debt.  
  
Seeing something like this again made his eyes go wide.  
  
He didn‚Äôt even notice the figure standing on the other side of the car. *Serena.*  
  
Serena had seen him the moment he stepped out of the elevator.  
  
Watching his eyes light up at the sight of the car, hungry and dazzled, she saw a glimpse of the arrogant boy he used to be.  
  
""You‚Äôre here?""  
  
The familiar voice jolted Francis. He snapped his head up. Her name slipped out before he could stop it‚Äîthen he remembered what the manager had said.  
  
A guest had requested him, specifically.  
  
So she *had* recognized him.  
  
Should he be impressed by her memory? He‚Äôd gone through great lengths to cover himself up.  
  
None of the others had noticed him.  
  
If he turned around now‚Äîwould it be too late?  
  
As Francis stood frozen, Serena curled her lips into a playful smile.  
  
""Let‚Äôs go. Take me home.""  
  
With that, she tossed him the keys, didn‚Äôt even look back, and slid into the back seat.  
  
Francis fumbled to catch the keys, then glanced through the rearview mirror at Serena, who had closed her eyes to rest.  
  
Too late to turn back now.  
  
Might as well treat this like any other driving gig.  
  
He drew in a deep breath, slid into the driver‚Äôs seat, buckled his seatbelt, and asked while watching her reflection,  
  
""Ms‚ÄîMs. Summers. Where do you live?""  
  
""Just drive.""  
  
Leaning lazily against the backrest, Serena suddenly opened her eyes, locking them onto him in the mirror.  
  
Her sudden stare made Francis twitch like a nervous little quail, eyes darting away in a panic.  
  
Watching him fluster in the mirror, Serena couldn‚Äôt help smiling faintly.  
  
""You really don‚Äôt know where I live?""  
  
""Heh... How would I know that?""  
  
Francis laughed awkwardly. But truth be told‚Äîhe *did* know.  
  
Serena had recently shelled out a massive sum‚Äîrisking even a break in her company‚Äôs cash flow‚Äîto buy a courtyard home in the city center.  
  
And that very courtyard...  
  
Had once been the Carter family estate.  
  
Back when they went bankrupt, they sold it for dirt cheap, hoping to stop the inevitable collapse. But it had been a drop in the bucket. Useless.  
  
Who would‚Äôve thought Serena would be the one to buy it?  
  
What a twist of fate.  
  
Francis let out a heavy sigh.  
  
""Of course you wouldn‚Äôt know.""  
  
Serena‚Äôs tone was cool, almost indifferent. ""I meant, check the GPS.""  
  
""Ah? Oh! Right!""  
  
*Damn it.*  
  
Did he misunderstand her?  
  
Francis reached for the screen, hand trembling. Her presence was too overwhelming‚Äîit threw him completely off balance.  
  
And under it all‚Äîwas guilt.  
  
Even though she was now a CEO who needed no one‚Äôs help.  
  
He tapped ‚ÄòHome‚Äô on the screen.  
  
The navigation popped up with a prompt:  
  
""Navigate to: Carter Family Estate? Estimated time: 36 minutes, 6 traffic lights...""  
  
*Carter Family... estate?*  
  
He stared at the address: 307 Golden Fire Road.  
  
It was the Carter estate, alright.  
  
But that was in the past.  
  
*Why... would she label it like that?*  
  
""Something wrong?""  
  
Serena‚Äôs voice floated from the back seat.  
  
*Something wrong?*  
  
*Of course something was wrong!*  
  
Francis didn‚Äôt think for a second that Serena still had feelings for him. No‚Äîthis was her way of reminding herself of the humiliation she once suffered.  
  
She wanted to remember. She wanted to repay it.  
  
This woman didn‚Äôt let anything go.  
  
If she couldn‚Äôt succeed, who could?  
  
Now realizing he was her target for revenge, Francis felt a chill crawl down his spine. He hurriedly tapped confirm.  
  
""N-No problem.""  
  
""Alright then. Let‚Äôs go.""  
  
He gripped the wheel tight, back straight, eyes locked on the road.  
  
The car started to move.  
  
Inside, silence.  
  
Neither spoke. Only the GPS chimed now and then.  
  
As familiar streets passed by the window, Serena finally broke the quiet.  
  
""Don‚Äôt you have anything to say?""  
  
""Huh?""  
  
Francis blinked, then mumbled, ""I‚Äôm just a lowly waiter. What could I possibly say to Ms. Summers...""  
  
The unspoken meaning was clear.  
  
They lived in two different worlds now.  
  
What could they even talk about?  
  
""I meant you.""  
  
Serena‚Äôs brows drew together slightly.  
  
She hated hearing him talk like that.  
  
He was never supposed to be this timid, this careful. He‚Äôd always been carefree. Bold. Wild.  
  
And seeing him bow and scrape in front of Ryan‚Äî  
  
It made her chest burn with rage.  
  
She wanted to turn Ryan into ash.  
  
Her voice grew a little louder.  
  
""It‚Äôs been years. Don‚Äôt you have *anything* to say to me?""  
  
""Ms. Summers.""  
  
Francis' throat bobbed. His knuckles turned white as he gripped the wheel. After a moment, he said quietly,  
  
""Ms. Summers... we‚Äôre here.""  
  
Serena‚Äôs body, which had been leaning forward, slowly relaxed. She leaned back, closed her eyes, then opened them again.  
  
""Not going to walk me in? You used to beg to walk me all the way to my dorm.""  
  
The moment she brought up the past, Francis squirmed in his seat.  
  
""Ms. Summers... You must have me confused with someone else...""  
  
""Confused? I‚Äôd recognize you even if you turned to ash.""  
  
Her voice dropped to a murmur.  
  
""Who brought me breakfast every morning? Who lit candles in my name outside the dorm and confessed with a megaphone? Who got me punished, cost me my scholarship?  
  
And who... gave me three hundred grand?""  
  
""Hmm?""  
  
""Mr. Carter. You don‚Äôt remember any of that?""  
  
*Crap!*  
  
*She really was here for revenge!*  
  
*All those tiny, trivial memories‚Äîshe remembered them all!*  
  
Cold sweat trickled down Francis' forehead. If he admitted it now, he was toast.  
  
*Think. Fast.*  
  
He forced a dumb smile.  
  
""H-Huh? Really? Ah, I don‚Äôt... I don‚Äôt recall any of that... Haha...""  
  
Through the rearview mirror, he saw himself trying desperately to escape.  
  
Serena murmured, ""Do you think we could go back?""  
  
""Go back?""  
  
Francis paused, then blurted, ""Gonna cost extra.""  
  
*Idiot.*  
  
Serena rolled her eyes and got out of the car.  
  
""If you want your money, come inside and get it.""  
  
""Hey‚Äî""  
  
Since when did she get so shameless?!  
  
Watching her walk away, Francis didn‚Äôt follow.  
  
Who knew what would happen if a young, innocent man like him stepped into her house?  
  
She definitely hadn‚Äôt let go of her grudge. She‚Äôd probably eat him alive the moment she got the chance.  
  
It‚Äôs just a few hundred bucks!  
  
He‚Äôd just write it off!  
  
Still, the fact that he‚Äôd clocked out early *just* to avoid her, and still ended up crossing paths‚Äîit left him a little bitter.  
  
Francis checked the time. Two hours before his next gig. Just enough time to change clothes and get into character.  
  
He gave the familiar courtyard one last look. Who knew if he‚Äôd ever be back again...  
  
Inside the house‚Äî  
  
Serena watched his retreating figure, a victorious smile curling at her lips.  
  
*Got you.*  
  
There‚Äôs plenty of time ahead.  
  
She pulled out her phone and dialed a number.  
  
""Find someone for me. I want everything‚Äîwhere he‚Äôs been living, what he‚Äôs been doing, all of it.""  
  
Halfway down the road, Francis suddenly shivered.  
  
He rubbed his arms and muttered,  
  
""Thing's about to go down?""

**Chapter 2 The School Beauty I Kept Is Now My Boss!**



As expected‚Äî  
  
June weather was like a kid‚Äôs temper: flipping in an instant.  
  
After days of endless rain, Francis' mood had begun to lift alongside it.  
  
Rainy days meant extra pay for delivery runs‚Äîtwo bucks more per trip!  
  
Do ten runs, and that‚Äôs an extra twenty bucks in the bag!  
  
Let it pour, let it flood!  
  
Inside the office‚Äî  
  
Francis stood in front of a massive glass window, hands wrapped around a steaming thermos. Down below, pedestrians and traffic scurried about like ants. And for a brief moment, Francis felt a strange surge of ambition‚Äîas if he could crush everything beneath his feet, even the lingering nightmares from running into Serena the last few days.  
  
But then‚Äî  
  
""Francis, take care of this document.""  
  
""Francis, where are we on this project?""  
  
""Francis, your client got arrested. We‚Äôre canceling your performance bonus.""  
  
*What the hell?*  
  
*The client got locked up, not me. Why the hell was my bonus gone?*  
  
Any desire to admire the view evaporated. Francis spun around and shot his supervisor a glare before replying:  
  
""Got it!""  
  
Ugh.  
  
Wage slave with a wage slave soul. Who said the working class were climbing anywhere?  
  
He refilled his thermos with a vengeance, plugged in his power bank, grabbed a handful of tissues, and stormed off to the bathroom to sit on the toilet.  
  
Fine, he couldn‚Äôt be a high-flyer, but he could still be a master slacker.  
  
After all‚Äî  
  
The money he earned slacking off with *skill*? That was real victory against capitalism.  
  
When he emerged‚Äî  
  
Francis headed to the break room and snagged two cups of coffee, just in time to hear the general manager‚Äôs assistant, Mia, gossiping:  
  
""You guys hear? Our company just got bought out!""  
  
""The new boss is coming by for inspection. Y‚Äôall better get it together. If they want to fire someone, they‚Äôll start with us small fries.""  
  
*Bought out?*  
  
What poor s\*cker decided to buy into this soon-to-be-bankrupt dumpster fire of a company?  
  
But hey‚Äîif heads were gonna roll, there‚Äôd be compensation!  
  
Francis' eyes sparkled with hope.  
  
His salary was crap, sure, but his seniority?  
  
Oh, he‚Äôd been slacking here for *years*.  
  
If the severance was good, he could take a breather. Maybe even rest for a while.  
  
""Mia,"" Francis trotted up beside her, grinning. ""Do you know the new boss' name?""  
  
""Yeah, it‚Äôs Serena‚Äî""  
  
Just as she was about to say more, her phone buzzed. A huge ‚ÄòMr. Jones‚Äô flashed on the screen. Mia dropped her coffee like it was on fire, face twisting into a rictus of stress‚Äîonly to sweeten her voice instantly:  
  
""Mr. Jones! I‚Äôm here! Yes, yes, I‚Äôll notify everyone right away.""  
  
The moment the call ended, her whole expression collapsed.  
  
*Tch.*  
  
*Women really could switch faces faster than changing clothes.*  
  
*Especially someone like Serena. Once soft and gentle like, now a cold, vengeful demon queen.*  
  
*Wait a sec.*  
  
*Serena? The new boss shares the same name with her?*   
  
*Or is Serena my new boss? No way!*  
  
The thought alone sent a chill down his spine. Francis stood frozen, brain wiped blank.  
  
He didn‚Äôt hear a word Mia said after that.  
  
""The big boss‚Äîshe‚Äôs here!""  
  
Mia sucked in a breath and squeezed her eyes shut in despair. ""And she wants everyone assembled‚Äîfor a meeting!""  
  
*A meeting?!*  
  
*New boss shows up and immediately wants to shake things up?*  
  
Francis frowned, full of dread. He didn‚Äôt even notice everyone else had already bolted out of the break room.  
  
You couldn‚Äôt mess around with all-hands meetings.  
  
You never wanted to be the first there‚Äîthat was prime brown-nosing time for the execs.  
  
But you really didn‚Äôt want to be the last either‚Äîthat‚Äôs when everyone noticed you.  
  
Neither was survivable for a low-level grunt like him.  
  
Especially when‚Äî  
  
Their meeting room was *tiny*. Like, *really* tiny.  
  
You had to time it just right to snag a corner seat and stay out of sight.  
  
By the time Francis snapped out of it‚Äî  
  
He was holding a little stool and speed-walking to the meeting room.  
  
And about thirty scorching-hot stares slammed into him all at once.  
  
Francis didn‚Äôt care about them, though.  
  
His eyes shot straight to the head of the table‚Äî  
  
*Nope.*  
  
*Not Serena.*  
  
He exhaled in relief.  
  
He *knew* it. Serena was the CEO of a *massive* tech company. Why the hell would she bother buying a dying little firm like theirs?  
  
Even if she wanted revenge, this was way too expensive a method.  
  
The weight on his chest vanished.  
  
Francis finally had the mental space to ignore the staring and look for his seat.  
  
The room was way too small.  
  
It barely fit twenty people.  
  
When they had full-staff meetings, you had to bring your own chair and squeeze in the back.  
  
Francis was usually a pro at snagging a corner.  
  
But this time‚Äî  
  
Ugh. This was all Serena‚Äôs fault!  
  
Ever since she showed up, his delivery times were off, and he even got slapped with a $200 speeding ticket!  
  
And now, even his prime slacker corner was gone!  
  
""No seat?""  
  
Behind him‚Äî  
  
A voice sent a jolt through Francis' entire being.  
  
Around him, coworkers sucked in their breath in unison.  
  
""She‚Äôs *gorgeous*.""  
  
""Isn‚Äôt that Serena from the Forbes list?!""  
  
""Holy crap‚ÄîSerena‚Äôs our new boss?!""  
  
*No.*  
  
*It had to be a hallucination.*  
  
*The big boss was already sitting at the head of the table!*  
  
It couldn‚Äôt be Serena!  
  
""Ms. Summers‚Äî""  
  
The man at the head of the table stood and shattered Francis' last shred of hope. He turned to Francis and urged gently:  
  
""Quick, find a seat.""  
  
""No need.""  
  
Before Francis could move, the voice behind him surveyed the packed room.  
  
""It‚Äôs not his fault. Our office is clearly too small. In that case‚Äîwasn‚Äôt the suite next door still vacant? Leo, go talk to the landlord. Buy the whole thing and knock through the wall.""  
  
*Buy it?! Buy the whole thing?!*

I have had random muscle twitches in the past I think due to over caffeination. I also think the biggest switch in diet since 2020 was that I started intaking more salt? I also have gone through streaks of drinking more than one cup of coffee a day 

Am I over thinking this? I feel like I do have a slight  difficulty breathing but maybe it‚Äôs from anxiety like sometimes I feel like multiple times a day I need to yawn to get a deep breath.

I just really don‚Äôt like our health system in America where they don‚Äôt tell you heyyyy this has been slightly higher over the past 5 years maybe we should look into it ‚Ä¶ but yeah. If I‚Äôm overthinking just let me know üòÖ",0,1751398451.0,kidneydisease,4,0.5,False

I'm a 30yo male from South America. With my brother, in South America, we created a chain that sells Ice Cream, Cakes and other desserts/coffee/etc (our business is 90% Cakes & Ice Cream). We own +10 stores and sell on +200 wholesale shops.

Our mom is the creator of all the recipes and products, she sold her cakes to friends and relatives for +5 years to support herself after getting divorced from my dad. With my brother and other family members we joined her into taking her recipes and creating  a full size company with +150 employees. 

  
Now, We've decided to raise money from an investor and bring the concept to Dallas, with some tweaks.

  
**The project:**

A latino-inspired Tres Leches focused Dessert House. Mainly focused on premium Cakes and Cakes in pints to go. No coffee. No chairs or servers. 

A chain of small stores with a bunch of different cakes and desserts ready for pickup.

**The target customer:**

22-40 yo women that usually goes or host parties in their houses. Moms. Or younger folks that want to have a lustful super sweet dessert.

**Where I live:**

State Thomas. Uptown.

  
**Where I want to open shop:**

Im still analyzing since im fairly new to Dallas but Im thinking anywhere between Dallas Uptown to Plano. Depending on Real Estate availability 



**The challenge:**

To get some type of product feedback, product sentiment from people from Dallas to show our investor before committing to invest the capital. To try to show him that what has been successful for us in South America, could be successful here in Dallas (and Texas)

  
**My current idea:**

To bake our product prototypes in small-sized pints, something like shots, and go to parks to give them away for free and do AB testing and see, (maybe film?) peoples reactions

  
**The question for this subreddit:**

Where can you guys recommend me to do that?

Will I get into trouble if I go to some park and start giving away free samples without a license?

* **Anime**: Currently watching The Apothecary Diaries, feels like there hasn't been much on this season. Let's chat about our favourite anime and exchange recommendations?
* **Lego**: Architecture, Star Wars and anything else that's cool to display. I may or may not be planning to have a Lego room in my next house
* **TCGs**: Pokemon and classic Digimon card collector, against my better judgment I'm thinking of getting back into Yu-Gi-Oh!
* **Archery**: I shoot at things, sometimes I hit them
* **DIY**: Bought a house 2 years ago, and might have finally run out of DIY. You get bonus points if you correctly guess how many holes the previous owners drilled for a single shelf
* **Pianist**: Occasionally the noises I make sound like anime songs
* **Reading**: I'm in my psychology/mental health/self-development/productivity phase. The Solo Leveling omnibus novel is also looking at me menacingly
* **Technology**: A general interest in computers, which ranges from gaming to building computers to home servers. And my day job is hacking
* **Sci-Fi and Fantasy**: The usual culprits like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings
* **Japanese**: Plan to travel to Japan one day and would like to be at least conversationally proficient
* **Being a functional adult**: Cooking, cleaning, ironing, I can do it all. If I don't know something, I'll go learn
* Making lists and collecting hobbies...

About me:

* White, British, 6'2"" with a slim build. Open to exchanging photos as we get to know each other
* I live in Hampshire. Open to long distance if there's potential to meet eventually and we put the effort into making it work
* Non-smoker and I don't drink. I generally prefer days out and nights in
* I'm open to having children but it'll need to be a ""hell yes"", equally fine never having kids. My focus right now is on finding someone I'd want to spend the rest of my life with
* I'm a big texter but also up for calls and video chats when we're comfortable with each other
* Don't really have just one love language, I'm physically affectionate and a big fan of holding hands when out and about. Quality time together and words of affirmation are also ways to my heart. I express my love with a bit of everything
* I'd describe myself as quite ambitious, always striving to be better. I also (usually) know when to slow down
* Not into alcoholic, hot or fizzy drinks. So when I propose coffee and cake for our first date, just know I'll actually be drinking apple juice. Walks in the part to feed ducks and other casual activity dates also welcome. Or we can just skip to doing a couples cosplay at comic con

Thoughts on relationships:

* Smoking, vaping and drugs are dealbreakers
* Looking for someone at a similar stage in life and generally set my age preference on dating sites to 25 - 33. Not a dealbreaker though if the vibe is good
* I'm open to chatting with people outside the UK, but my expectations of it turning into anything serious are low. Feel free to try convince me otherwise, but you'll have to put a lot of effort in
* Communication is really important to me and something I actively want to get better at as well. Low effort first messages are unlikely to get a reply. Prove to me you've actually read my post. Conversely, high effort first messages are basically guaranteed to get us chatting
* Some shared hobbies and values are nice but I also want to know what you're into. It's expected that part of being in a relationship is doing your own thing, but spending time together on shared hobbies is nice as well
* I'm a complete person and hopefully so are you. Together, we could be more than the sum of our parts

My mom has vocalized for years how unhappy she‚Äôs been in her marriage. 10-months ago my mom decided to separate from my dad and started seeing another man. 

I‚Äôve expressed to both of them how I don‚Äôt want to be in the middle or involved in conflict. However my dad has done the following things and I am not speaking to him because of them:

1.) Make comments about how my mom is the one who destroyed the family, that she is the reason our family will never be the same and other similar comments that villainize my mother.

2.) Says he saw demons and thinks the house my parents shared has evil in it 

3.) Finding my moms new apartment and showing up unannounced 2-3 times that she knows of 

4.) Throwing a cup full of coffee at my mom and her car as she was leaving 

5.) Came to MY apartment unannounced because I told him I needed space from him 

6.) Showed up at my work to drop off card and flowers because I  wont speak with him 

7.) Told my 23 year old brother who lives in a different city that he is suicidal and thinking about buying a gun 

8.) Incessant messaging and calling. The messages are mostly a combination of how much he misses me, loves me and is proud of me 

Am I the asshole for not speaking with him? I feel this incredible sense of guilt.  I know he needs help. The guilt is weighing on me and I don‚Äôt know what to do.

In Armenian and Mediterranean culture it was seen as a mark from a past life, soul contract, being spiritually chosen.

I snapped awake, gasping. The morning sun burned through the blinds. I was drenched in sweat, the taste of copper thick in my mouth. I wiped my lips and stared at the red stain on my palm. Nosebleed. I staggered to the bathroom and turned on the light. My face looked like I hadn‚Äôt slept in days; dark bags, blood crusted to my upper lip, skin pale. My shirt was sticking to me like I‚Äôd been rained on. I pulled it off, eyes closed as my eyes burned with exhaustion. I looked up to the mirror, stopping in my tracks.¬†
Across my chest; scratches. Long, red, fresh. I hadn‚Äôt had them when I went to bed. The phone rang suddenly. I jumped, staring at it for a moment before walking over. I picked it up slowly, as if it might explode in my hand.
‚ÄúByrne?‚Äù Clancy‚Äôs voice came through, low, uneasy.
‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ yeah, I‚Äôm here,‚Äù
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something you need to see. It‚Äôs about the kid. The one we found in the woods.‚Äù
I swallowed, my throat dry.
‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù
‚ÄúThey finished the toxicology. No drugs, no alcohol. But there were marks... strange symbols carved into his back. Looked like rope burns at first but... these weren‚Äôt random.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat kind of symbols?‚Äù I asked.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Some kind of runes, maybe. Not anything I‚Äôve seen before. You need to come down here,‚Äù He finished, sighing over the phone.¬†
I didn‚Äôt answer right away. I looked over my shoulder, half-expecting the noose to be hanging in my hallway.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there in twenty,‚Äù I told him as I cleared my throat.¬†
I didn‚Äôt even change clothes. I threw on a jacket, grabbed my badge, and got in the car. The whole way to the station I kept checking my rearview mirror. Every time I did, it felt like someone would be sitting in the backseat, watching.
Nothing was there. But it felt like something was. When I got to the precinct, Clancy was already waiting for me in the back hallway, a folder clutched to his chest.
‚ÄúYou look like shit,‚Äù he said, flatly.
‚ÄúI feel worse,‚Äù I grunted. He handed me the folder with a worried expression.¬†
‚ÄúTell me if I‚Äôm losing it,‚Äù he said, watching me as I opened it.
Photos; close-ups of the victim‚Äôs back. Long, jagged marks, like rope, had been wrapped tight and then seared into the skin. But some of the marks were... deliberate. Etched. I traced one of them with my finger over the plastic sleeve.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen this before,‚Äù I whispered.
Clancy looked up. ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù
‚ÄúIn my dream. Last night.‚Äù He stared at me.
‚ÄúYou remember that guy you questioned, Cian?‚Äù he asked slowly.
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I responded.¬†
‚ÄúHe was talking about the marks before he bled out. Said they were ‚Äòpart of the pact.‚Äô Whatever that means,‚Äù He shrugged. I closed the folder, heart pounding.
‚ÄúHe said I started something. Something I don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù I told him.¬†
Clancy nodded.
‚ÄúWell, maybe you should try,‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù
He glanced around the hallway, then leaned in close.
‚ÄúYou ever heard of the Black Knot?‚Äù He asked quietly, almost whispering.¬†
‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I replied, confused.¬†
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs folklore. Real obscure shit. Came up in some files I pulled after the first incident. Some old Celtic ritual about binding souls. Hanging trees. Spirits trapped in the noose. People who touch it become... marked,‚Äù
I blinked. ‚ÄúMarked how?‚Äù
Clancy took a step back.
‚ÄúThey belong to it now,‚Äù
Silence filled the hallway. Then a deputy came running up, face pale.
‚ÄúClancy. Byrne. We‚Äôve got another one,‚Äù We both turned.
‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù Clancy asked. The deputy swallowed, glancing at me before answering.
‚ÄúOutside Byrne‚Äôs house.‚Äù
Clancy didn‚Äôt say much on the drive over. The cruiser hummed beneath us, tires slicing through wet asphalt as we moved past rows of quiet houses. I sat stiffly, head leaning against the passenger window, trying to focus on the rain as it painted lines across the glass. My stomach twisted with something deep, something sour and heavy.
‚ÄúYou good?‚Äù Clancy asked, eyes still on the road.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I lied, voice low. He looked over, making a double-take as he furrowed his brow.¬†
‚ÄúYour nose is bleeding,‚Äù He uttered.¬†
I wiped it with the back of my hand, blinking at the smear of red across my skin. I didn‚Äôt respond.
Clancy turned onto my street, slowing to a crawl as the yellow tape came into view. A couple of cruisers were already parked in front of my house, red and blue lights quietly rotating in the misty gray of the morning.
He parked behind one of them, and I opened the door slowly, my legs stiff as I stepped out. The second I stood up, my stomach lurched. I doubled over and threw up in the gutter; thick, wet heaves that burned my throat. It wasn‚Äôt food. It was dark. Too dark. It tasted of metal and dirt.¬†
Clancy came around to my side of the car, watching me.
‚ÄúYou sure this is just stress?‚Äù he asked.
‚ÄúI said I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I snapped, coughing and wiping my mouth with my sleeve.
We crossed the lawn. It felt wrong, like stepping into someone else‚Äôs home. Deputies were gathered near the tree in my backyard. One of them looked over at me and immediately looked away. Clancy pushed ahead, motioning for me to follow.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not gonna like this,‚Äù one of the officers mumbled to Clancy as we passed. We stepped into the backyard. That damn oak tree stood tall in the mist, its limbs stretched wide like arms waiting for something. Hanging from one of the thicker branches was a body. The noose creaked with every soft breeze.
I froze.
At first glance, it looked like me. Same build. Same height. Same slumped posture, head tilted slightly to the side. My heart stopped for a second. I couldn‚Äôt breathe, a hand to my chest was the only thing keeping my heart from bursting out of my chest. My vision flattened once more, ears ringing. But as we got closer, I realized it wasn‚Äôt me. Younger, maybe early twenties. Messy brown hair matted with blood. Wearing a torn gray hoodie, soaked and stained. One sneaker missing. Wrists wrapped in old, deep ligature marks like he‚Äôd been tied up before the end.
‚ÄúDo we have an ID?‚Äù Clancy asked, stepping toward the body.
‚ÄúNot yet,‚Äù one of the deputies said. ‚ÄúNeighbor called it in about an hour ago. Said he thought he saw Mark walking into the yard sometime around four. Then I saw the body hanging around six.‚Äù Clancy glanced at me.
I couldn‚Äôt move. My hands were shaking, my stomach turning again. My head pulsed like something inside was knocking to get out. I cleared my throat, feeling bile creep up the back of my esophagus. 
‚ÄúWhy does he look like me?‚Äù I asked quietly. Clancy didn‚Äôt answer. The body hung still now, like the wind had gone dead. Something on the ground caught Clancy‚Äôs eye. He crouched down, motioning for a flashlight. One of the deputies handed it over, and he clicked it on, sweeping the beam across the damp dirt.
Symbols. Carved crudely into the mud. Long spirals. Crossed lines. Circles with small hooks like teeth curling out from their edges.
‚ÄúSame markings from the crime scene in the woods,‚Äù Clancy muttered.
I stumbled forward, nausea rising again. I dropped to my knees, coughing into my hands. This time, when I looked down, I saw more than just blood; thick, black threads swimming in my spit like oil in water.
I sat back on my heels, trying to breathe. The body was still swinging gently above us. I looked up. Something was carved into the branch, Just above where the noose was tied.

BYRNE

I stared.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do that,‚Äù I said.
‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Clancy responded, but he didn‚Äôt sound convinced.
And for a second, I wasn‚Äôt either.¬†
I didn‚Äôt say much after that.
Clancy talked with the forensics guy, muttered something about getting someone from State to look at the symbols. I just stood there, swaying slightly, trying not to vomit again. My stomach was cramping hard now, like something inside was twisting tighter with every breath I took.
We left after an hour. Clancy drove this time too. Said I was in no shape to be behind the wheel, not that I argued. I leaned against the window, eyes half-lidded, watching the world bleed past. Everything looked distant. Too slow. Like I was watching it all through a thick layer of glass.
We didn‚Äôt speak until we got back to the station. I sat on the edge of Clancy‚Äôs desk while he typed into the system, pulling up old case files and cross-referencing the symbols. I took off my jacket, my arms were burning under the sleeves. Like sunburn, but worse. Like fire just beneath the skin.
I rolled up my sleeves, stopped breathing. There were lines on my arms. Thin, red scratches. Some shallow, some deeper. Fresh. Like they‚Äôd been carved while I was asleep. I touched one and flinched. It stung.
‚ÄúClancy,‚Äù I said, voice low.
He didn‚Äôt look up. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù
‚ÄúClancy,‚Äù I repeated sternly.¬†
He turned and saw my arms.
‚ÄúJesus, Mark. When did that happen?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I whispered.
He stepped closer, inspecting the marks like he wasn‚Äôt sure if they were real.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre the same shapes. Same as in the dirt,‚Äù he said slowly. ‚ÄúLook.‚Äù
He reached into his desk drawer and pulled out one of the printed photos from earlier that morning. He held it next to my arm. The curve of the spiral. The hooked teeth. The slash marks. All of it; identical.
‚ÄúMark, what the hell is happening to you?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I said again, shaking my head.
He stared at me, searching my face for something, some clue, maybe some lie. But there wasn‚Äôt anything left to hide. I was falling apart right in front of him.
I rolled the sleeve back down and leaned forward, elbows on my knees, pressing my palms against my eyes until everything turned white.
‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs the noose,‚Äù I said finally.
Clancy sat back down in his chair. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù
‚ÄúI mean, it did something. I touched it, and it‚Ä¶ took something from me. Or gave something. I don‚Äôt know. But ever since then‚Ä¶ the dreams, the guy at the hospital, the attack‚Ä¶ this thing on my skin. It‚Äôs all tied to that moment.‚Äù
He was quiet for a long time.
Then he stood up, grabbed his coat, and tossed mine at me.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúGo where?‚Äù
‚ÄúTo the forest,‚Äù
We parked at the edge of the Clove Hoof trailhead. The sky had darkened again, gray clouds rolling in like a slow bruise. Wind whipped through the trees, cold and sharp. I stepped out of the car, legs unsteady, every movement feeling like it was being resisted, like something didn‚Äôt want me back here.
We walked the trail in silence, Clancy holding a flashlight, even though it was still early afternoon. The trees bent in above us, forming a loose canopy that darkened everything underneath.
I started sweating. Hard. My breath came short. My legs dragged.
Clancy looked over, concern flashing in his eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre white as hell, man.‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt answer.
We reached the tree again.
The oak in the middle of all those redwoods. The only one of its kind.
The branch the noose had hung from was still there, bare, scarred with old rope burns. The grass beneath it had been trampled, muddy and dark. Clancy stepped forward, sweeping the flashlight around the base of the tree.
‚ÄúThere,‚Äù he pointed. ‚ÄúMarkings. Again.‚Äù More symbols. More spirals. Fresh, still wet.
‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a language,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúOr a warning.‚Äù
‚ÄúOr a curse,‚Äù I muttered. He turned to look at me.
I was gripping my stomach. Blood was coming from my nose again, faster now, and the back of my throat tasted like pennies and rust.
I pulled up my sleeve. The markings were spreading. Now across my shoulder, down to my wrist. And they were moving.
Clancy backed up a step. ‚ÄúOkay. Okay. We need help. Like real help.‚Äù I sank to my knees.
I was freezing and sweating at the same time. My vision blurred. I could feel something crawling just beneath my skin. I looked up at Clancy, eyes wide.
‚ÄúI think it wants me dead, Clance.‚Äù He stepped toward me, gripping my shoulders tightly.
‚ÄúNo. Fuck that. We‚Äôre going to figure this out, alright? We‚Äôll find out what this is. We‚Äôll find who started it. We‚Äôre not letting you die like this.‚Äù I looked past him. Just behind the tree. There was someone standing there. Tall. Thin. Barefoot. Soaked in mud and shadow. Head tilted too far to the left. Watching us.
Not moving.I opened my mouth to speak, but my throat locked up. My hands trembled.
Clancy turned to see what I was staring at, but the figure was already gone.
He didn‚Äôt say anything right away, just stared at the empty space behind the tree, flashlight beam trembling slightly in his hand.
‚ÄúYou saw something,‚Äù he said finally.
I nodded, slow. ‚ÄúIt was watching us.‚Äù I choked out.¬†
‚ÄúWas it‚Ä¶ human?‚Äù
I hesitated. ‚ÄúMostly.‚Äù
Clancy cursed under his breath and turned back to me.¬†
‚ÄúAlright, we‚Äôre done out here. I don‚Äôt care if we have to call in every spook from Langley to fucking Vatican City. You‚Äôre not dying in this goddamn forest.‚Äù
He hauled me up, my legs barely cooperating. My vision swam, but I followed him as best I could. The woods felt alive now, pressing closer, the trees leaning in, the wind whispering in a voice that wasn‚Äôt quite wind. I could hear something. Not words. More like humming. Low. Wrong. Like the world itself was remembering something it wanted to forget.
We were almost to the car when I collapsed again. My knees buckled and I hit the dirt hard, coughing violently. I doubled over and vomited something thick and black, steaming in the cold air. Clancy was shouting, but it sounded far away.
Then;
Everything went quiet.
Not silent. Quiet. The kind that feels like the air has been sucked out of the world. Like something‚Äôs holding its breath.I looked up. The trees were still. The clouds above had frozen mid-drift.
And in front of me, kneeling now in the dirt, was the figure. Closer. Clearer. Its eyes were hollow, dark pits, but I felt it looking at me.
It reached out a hand, long-fingered, the nails black and cracked like old bark. It touched my chest. And I remembered something that wasn‚Äôt mine.
A rope. A fire. A name screamed into the woods until the voice gave out. Pain. So much pain.
I gasped, sucking in breath like I‚Äôd been underwater for days. The figure was gone again. Vanished without sound or trace. But the symbols on my skin? They were glowing now. Faint red light, pulsing like a heartbeat. I yelled out in a searing pain, clawing at the marks as they burned and singed my skin. 
Clancy hauled me up, panicked now. ‚ÄúMark, Jesus, we‚Äôre going now.‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt argue. My head lolled as he half carried me back to the car.¬†
Back at the station, I sat wrapped in a blanket, a cup of coffee going cold in my hands. Clancy was pacing, phone to his ear, shouting into it. He‚Äôd called in favors. Old friends. Experts. Anyone who might know what the hell we were dealing with.
I stared at my reflection in the darkened window. My eyes looked wrong. Too wide. Too still.
The thing in the forest had left something in me.
And I wasn‚Äôt sure it ever meant to leave.

I have used them a ton because I would listen to music for a whole work shift. With at least 4 years of consistent use, they are kind of falling apart and most likely need to be replaced soon. The left one has barely any sound and they seem to get muffled randomly. 

I am looking for something with decent battery life, at least 8 hours so they are useful for work. I looked at another pair of Raycons but I'm not sure I want to spend $79. These have lasted a while, but I am typically hard on tech because I am constantly dropping stuff and the like. Once had a pair of wired earbuds tragically meet their end when one of the buds fell out and landed in my coffee. 

I'm in the US, and am looking for something decent and affordable, probably cheaper than the $79 I am wary of paying. 

They don't need to be fancy, they just need to work and ideally have long battery life. I don't like bone conduction because the people I work around are so loud that even if I can still hear my music or podcast, I can't concentrate on it because there's so much background noise. 

I also have weird shaped ears and have trouble with things that don't have the soft interchangeable eartips. The hard plastic earbuds without soft tips are too big and hurt my ears after more than a couple of minutes of use.

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks! ",2,1751398029.0,HeadphoneAdvice,2,1.0,False

We discussed a lot and are definitely agreeing on several topics. Went for a coffee date and dinner and Itold her I wanna see her the 3rd time. She told she enjoyed it too and it was even better than the first time. 

However, she definitely doesn't text first. In our conversations on the dating app I check in or start a conversation 9/10 times. We have been on whatsapp for 10 days and litrrally everyday I checkec in, she didn't even once.

She is very anxious and traditional. She expects the man to lead, attract etc and is anxious. How do I know?

- she never had a relationship and told me the date with me was her 3rd date, she tood me she was nervous as hell;

- when we had our first date she sent a message saying she would a bit later, I read but was busy and wanted to reply when outside. Not even 10 mins passed and she said that it's not nice to leave her on read on dating day and if I wanna blow off I can just say. I explained, reassured and then it was fine.

- before the second date I asked her on date day how she feels. Even tho the date was ser she said she didn't arrange her agenda as I didn't message her one day before and it was radio silence since my other date a day before. I explained and it was fine.

She makes the impression of very anxious, traditional and even tho I accept that a man should take lead more, it doesn't feel good this way.
It's definitely not a lack of interest as she relies really fast and extensive when I text, she paid for the first and partially for the second date and keeps dating. We also discussed a loooot.

How should I bring up this? And please don't tell me to just let and move on. The dating pool is fucked op for a 36M and besides this issue all is fine. Don't wanna blow up something good for this.

I am a public library branch manager in the United States. I'm aware of a sizable Ethiopian community in my service area and eager to welcome them into the library.

I am fairly unfamiliar with Ethiopian culture, history, etc. so I've come here for your help in addition to hopefully speaking with some folks in my immediate community.

Here are some things I'm thinking about:

* I've observed many Ethiopians in my community seem to congregate in coffee shops and know coffee is a big part of Ethiopian economy. Is it likely a regularly-occurring program/event centered around coffee and conversing would be attractive to Ethiopians in the US? Is there anything I could include in such a program to make it more attractive? (Note: US public libraries have extremely limited budgets, but I'll take any and all ideas and see what I can make of them.)
* Are there other programs/events/topics that would be especially attractive to Ethiopians?
* Are there public libraries in Ethiopia like there are in the US? Culturally, would an Ethiopian immigrant recognize a US public library, how it works in general, that it's free to use, etc.? If not, how can I best communicate this? Is there another Ethiopian institution I can compare to US public libraries to help?
* Our world language collection is currently very small (budgets! staff expertise!) -- what books would the Ethiopian community in general most likely want to see on the shelves? Movies? Other media? Do Ethiopians generally read things published by American companies if they're language accessible? Relatedly, where can I keep up with Ethiopian publishing best?
* Are there cultural things I should be aware of when designing spaces or welcoming Ethiopian community members?

I'm afraid I don't know what I don't know, so I welcome any information or guidance you can share that you think may be helpful even beyond my specific questions above.",5,1751397982.0,Ethiopia,0,1.0,False

Could that be the root cause, and if so is it safe to disable it? 

\----------

I just bought a new macbook pro, and I was super exited to get the better chip (M4 Pro) and one with better memory (24 GB). My previous macbook pro was a 2021 14in with an M1 chip and 8GB of memory and I was fine with it, but it ended up dying from a coffee spill and never resurrected, so I thought I'd go all in with this ""fresh start"".

While the battery in this new macbook pro is significantly better, the big difference I noticed was that the whole computer gets WAY warmer, and the area above the F keys is hot to the touch. I also have never heard any fans activate to try to cool things down. So far I am only using the computer to the capacity that I used my previous macbook pro, which never overheated. I got the better memory because I eventually need better graphic visualizing to look at 3D mesh surfaces (.obj, .stl files).

From what I've investigated, the overheating might be from my computer's specs being ""too powerful"" for the size of the computer itself, and that I should have gotten a larger macbook pro. If that's the case than I'm pretty peeved, because as someone who isn't very technically inclined I didn't consider physical size of the computer impacting performance (most things I read up on just discussed memory and chip), especially since overheating wasn't an issue in the past. My plan right now is to get a short but simply computer stand that allows proper airflow. Is there anything else I should look into?

In my second reading, it's brought up a lot of feelings when reading about AA/White Flag/etc (Pg 343, 8 Nov, YDAU Interdependence day), and where the depths of addiction take you. I missed a lot during my first read through because of grief/numbness/trying to speedrun the book.

When I was a kid, I went to court ordered AA meetings with my mom and reading these sections now makes me remember those times and all those people. The scenes the same, the crappy coffee the same, really a lot of similar people, i remember always being bothered by the weird lighting. Id play with the other children elsewhere in the church, sneak and grab a donut and drink coffee from a flimsy styrofoam cup.

As I read, I felt like she was telling me through the book what she was going through and I was finally understanding the inner battle she was facing. It gave me a lot of empathy that I just wasnt mentally capable of having when she was still alive. I just couldnt understand why she couldn't stop, I couldnt understand how it got so so bad. I was clouded by anger, being young, and being too close to it all

Starting at pg 346, I've seen my mom go through each of these phases. Pg. 347 details the late stages of addiction and it hit me like bricks. It's gut wrenching and haunting to read if you have had the misfortune of seeing a loved one go through it. I appreciate that there's two tones when talking about the progression of the disease, first it was a little cheeky and funny (but deeply sad), but it grows more sinister.

I felt like I was sitting in the room with the AA'ers. I couldnt help but imagine my mother back in one of these meetings and wonder what if she kept going. A million what-ifs ran through my mind. What if she got to be like the Crocodiles with decades of sobiety under their belt. What if she could just 'Hang In.' What if she read this book? I do know she would agree with JvD that ""but for the grace of god"" doesnt make sense

Pg 379 ""...what a tragic adventure this is, that none of them signed up for""

I've read most of wallace's work, and while I think a lot of his characters can come off as caricatures stretched beyond the human average (not a bad thing), the AA people and people in the throes of addiction he describes kinda.. arent. Are they already caricatures because of the disease? idk, just a thought.

  
Anyway, just wanted to share. If theres anyone else out there who can ID with this, cool. Also -  I'm proud of any of you on your sobriety journey, much respect. One day at a time.

‚ÄúCome down to my office and we will explain everything‚Äù responded Newsome.¬†

‚ÄúFine all five of us‚Äù.

Newsome agreed. The five of them walked into Newsome‚Äôs isolated office. Liam stared at the ground,¬† looking very uncomfortable.¬†

Michael had felt sick to his stomach. He had allowed something traumatizing to happen to Cain once. These people he was with, if he had any suspicion they were part of the kidnapping, he was going to go hands on. They entered Mr. Newsome‚Äôs office and Mr. Newsome began talking.¬†

‚ÄúMr. Vortox, your son Liam was snooping around my classroom and started yelling profanities as a joke.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust why the hell would he do that? Where‚Äôs Cain?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe ran out the school doors, I think your son Liam riled him trying to play jokes.‚Äù

Barnliver chimed in ‚ÄúYes I think we will have to discipline them when we get Cain back. Probably after school detention for both of them.‚Äù¬†

Michael stared at both of them. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt sound like something either of them would do.‚Äù

‚ÄúLiam‚Äôs actually had a history of horseplay last year and the year before‚Äù

Michael sighed and began to walk around the office. He knew his boys weren‚Äôt perfect but if words had a scent, this would be bullshit.¬†

‚ÄúWhat if I refuse to make them do after school detention. Would they get out of school detention?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want your children in school Mr. Vortox?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo be honest, I don‚Äôt trust the three of you right now, I really don‚Äôt.‚Äù¬†

Newsome grabbed a bag and started digging around. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt trust me, I will get all the logs that shows the progress Cain has been making.‚Äù¬†

Michael looked around his office and saw data logs on his computer. There were logs of ‚Äúdistances variable could fly‚Äù, ‚Äúfire variable‚Äù ,‚Äúobjects variable can move‚Äù. Michael was horrified. This wasn‚Äôt a classroom.¬†

Newsome‚Äôs eyes grew wide. He had been sloppy. How could he have left that up? He set the bag down and grabbed another. He began to maneuver around behind Michael and next to Liam.

Michael glared at Mr. Barnliver and growled ‚ÄúJust what the fuck operation are you-

Mr. Newsome shuffled through the bag and pulled out a pistol with a silencer on it and shot Michael in the back of the head. Michael‚Äôs entire body shook and straightened out momentarily. Blood sprayed the wall and Mr. Barnliver. Michael‚Äôs body fell to the ground. Liam screamed and swatted the gun out of Newsome‚Äôs hand. Liam and Newsome both dove on the ground wrestling for position to grab the pistol. Mr. Barnliver ran over and picked up the pistol. Newsome yelled ‚ÄúFinish him!‚Äù¬†

Barnliver pointed the gun at Liam as lay crying on the floor. His finger went to the trigger when something zoomed into the room and hit Barnliver with such force that they went through the wall. Liam heard footsteps from the opposite end of the room¬† and looked back. It was Geraldson. Geraldson stared at Michael‚Äôs body while a pool of blood began to flow underneath. Liam crawled out of the office. He couldn‚Äôt look at his dad‚Äôs body any longer.¬†

‚ÄúYou are all under arrest‚Äù commanded Officer Gerald. ‚ÄúLiam go outside.‚Äù Liam nodded and began to run out.¬†

‚ÄúLiam?‚Äù a voice rang out from the hole in the wall. Mr. Barnliver‚Äôs severed head was tossed through a hole in Mr. Newsome‚Äôs office. ‚ÄúLiam are you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúCain stay in there!‚Äù¬†

Cain walked out. Glared at Newsome and Shultz who looked visibly frightened. Cain looked down at his dad‚Äôs body. His mouth opened but no sound came out. He grew red.¬†

‚ÄúShoot him, he's the dangerous one!‚Äù Shultz yelled out pointing at Cain.¬†

Cain grabbed her arm and snapped it into two. Ms. Shultz opened her mouth to scream but Cain grabbed a coffee mug sitting on the desk and shoved it down her throat. Muffled screaming came out of Ms. Shultz‚Äôs stuffed throat. Geraldson yelled for Cain but Cain waved his hand and set him flying back twenty feet.¬†

‚ÄúGET OUT OF HERE!‚Äù yelled Cain in a deep voice unlike his own. Newsome began to run out of his office but Cain sent a force into his left knee making it unusable. Cain lifted both of them and threw them through the gymnasium doors. Geraldson ran and hit the fire alarm. This was going to get ugly if he didn‚Äôt get the other students out of the building. Cain levitated a foot off the ground and floated into the gymnasium. Officer Riddle ran around the corner and saw Cain floating and two other adults floating. ‚ÄúCain stop or I will have to shoot!‚Äù Cain waived his hand and tipped the bleachers on top of Officer Riddle. Cain screamed which shook the entire school. Officer Geraldson ran outside and directed the other officers to evacuate the other students. Cain ripped off Ms. Shultz‚Äôs limbs from her torso and threw the pieces to the side. It was just him and Newsome.¬†

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have to be this way Cain. We can get away from this.‚Äù¬†

Tears flew from Cain‚Äôs face as he roared ‚ÄúYou killed my father!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThe world can be yours Cain.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt already is.‚Äù¬†

Cain lifted his hands and set Newsome on fire. Newsome screamed as he became a floating human torch. Cain screamed back as he made the fire hotter and hotter. Then Cain screamed and blew roof off of the gymnasium. Still levitating, Cain levitated down the halls of the school destructing the windows, walls and whatever stood in his way.¬†

Lara ran off and got into her car when Riddle had left. She had heard Geraldson on the radio. Cain was at the school. As she pull up she saw the school imploding from the inside. Students and adults were running away. Running for their lives. Lara parked in the parking lot. The entrance exploded. Cain walked out of the entrance his surroundings were lighting on fire as he passed. Some cops were trying to get in range to take the shot. No.. she couldn‚Äôt lose her baby again. Lara got out of her car.¬†

‚ÄúNo stop! Don‚Äôt shoot please! Cain stop this!‚Äù¬†

Lara ran toward Cain. She promised Cain she would never let anything happen to him again. She couldn‚Äôt sit back and watch him go again.¬†

An officer hiding behind his car held up his pistol and shot. Lara jumped front of Cain with her arms out. She was hit in the chest. Lara took a deep breath in and wheezed. Cain snapped out of his rage and caught his mother before she fell. He looked up and put a force field around him and Lara.¬†

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù¬†

Lara smiled and touched his face. ‚ÄúCain.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo no not you too. Why?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCain‚Ä¶‚Äù she forced out a laugh and a little blood trickled out of her mouth.¬†

‚ÄúI always wanted to be good mom‚Ä¶. Don‚Äôt be disappointed in me.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI could never be disappointed in you baby. I‚Äôm disappointed in the world and what they‚Äôve put us through.‚Äù She glanced out of the forcefield to see cops shooting at them with no effect.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll always love you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love you too mom. Please don‚Äôt leave me‚Ä¶‚Äù Cain was crying watching his mom take her last breath. She began to struggle and Cain held her tighter. Then she was still. Cain laid her down staring at her. He slowly turned to the cop cars raised his hands up and blew every squad car up in front of him. Then he started blowing up the cars behind them.¬†

Geraldson could see the town being destroyed before his very eyes. Explosion after explosion. Bodies flying past him. Everything behind him was on fire. Geraldson broke his promise to always protect Cain and ran the opposite direction as far as he could.¬†

Liam was running but the explosions and fires were catching up fast. Everything was going to be destroyed until the army came in and took Cain out. Liam stopped. Living in a world where Cain died didn‚Äôt feel worth it. Liam ran toward the destruction. Floating ten feet off the ground, he saw his brother blowing up buildings and cars.¬†

‚ÄúCain!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCain!‚Äù

‚ÄúLiam?‚Äù

‚ÄúCain you have to stop. You‚Äôve taken out the cult. You are hurting innocent people now.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey took mom. They took mom Liam.‚Äù¬†

Liam looked down at the ground and tears fell.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to end all of them Liam.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúEven me?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù

‚ÄúDenny?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo not Denny either.‚Äù

‚ÄúCain these houses, they belong to people like us. People like Denny. People like Charlotte or Carlie. You have to stop and go. If you don‚Äôt the military is going to take you out.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I want to be around anymore Liam.‚Äù Liam could feel the fire closing in around him.¬†

‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt do it for yourself. Do it for me. We are all we have Liam. I can‚Äôt go on without you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve done too much Liam.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre still my brother.‚Äù Liam smiled at Cain. Cain‚Äôs eyes became glassy. Cain floated to Liam, picked him up and flew out of Addersfield. Liam looked at the town glowing below. Cain waited till they were far enough away and put Liam on the ground. The both looked at each other.¬†

‚ÄúHow far do I have to go?‚Äù

‚ÄúFar Cain. Far enough to where you are off the radar.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill we ever see each other again?‚Äù¬†

Liam swallowed hard.

‚ÄúWe will find a way, Cain. That‚Äôs what us Vortox‚Äôs do.‚Äù¬†

The boys could hear helicopters getting near. Liam nodded to Cain and Cain shook his head. Cain started to walk away, paused, and looked back. ‚ÄúLove you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLove you too‚Äù¬†

They hugged for a brief second. Cain‚Äôs eyes began to glass up again. He let go of Liam, took off running and flew in the sky at a speed that was barely visible.",2,1751397392.0,libraryofshadows,1,1.0,False

I agreed and she connected me and my now boss (38M), the owner of the place. It was a little weird to me that she was in contact with a man this age so I asked her how did she know he was searching for a manager and she said she drinks her coffee there every morning and she would sometimes run into him and they would have a small chat.

I didn‚Äôt think much of it and we met for an interview and I got the job that same day.

A few months went by and everything was going great, I connected with all the workers and my boss and genuinely enjoyed the work, but then things got a little weird.

As Leah came by every morning to get her coffee, she would start spending more time talking to my boss if he was around than she would with me, I didn‚Äôt say anything because I just thought I‚Äôm being unreasonable, that they‚Äôre just being friendly with each other and she sees me much more than she sees him. 

Gradually, they began getting flirty with each other, pretty long hugs, touching each other on the arm or hair, compliments that were a little inappropriate which made me extremely uncomfortable because despite the fact he‚Äôs old enough to be our father, he‚Äôs my boss and Leah had a boyfriend. 

A few days ago I met with a mutual friend of ours (21F) and without even knowing of the situation, she straight up told me that Leah broke up with her boyfriend and asked her not to tell me that she‚Äôs planning on making a move on my boss. I asked our friend if it would be okay if I talked to Leah about it, she agreed and said that she also thinks it‚Äôs a little weird and that she doesn‚Äôt blame me for being uncomfortable by it.

Just for background wise, me and Leah are very good friends, our friend group meets atleast once a week and occasionally we would drive each other to and from work. Also I should probably add that from the conversations I‚Äôve had with my boss (we have a pretty close friendly relationship, I tell him about my dating life and he tells me about his) I got the impression that he‚Äôs not the best guy when it comes to dating. he‚Äôs a good looking successful guy who‚Äôs aware of it and uses it to dump women every other day.

WIBTA if I will ask her not to make a move on him because it would make my working environment uncomfortable and I don‚Äôt want her to get hurt by him, or should I just try to ignore the whole situation and mind my own business?",0,1751397361.0,AmItheAsshole,13,0.33,False

hardcore mode:

* cold showers in the morning (sounds like torture but hear me out). started with 30 seconds, now at 2 mins. feels like hitting ur brain's reset button
* deleted all my bookmarks/saved posts. ur brain is like a browser w too many tabs open, sometimes u gotta force close that
* switched from coffee to green tea w l-theanine. way cleaner energy, no more feeling like a crackhead by 3pm
* started doing ""dopamine detox sundays"" where i literally just sit with my boredom. first few weeks were hell but now my brain actually enjoys doing normal again

the weird but effective stuff:

* breathing exercises but not the meditation bs everyone talks aboutt. look up ""box breathing"" - literally takes 2 mins and stops ur brain from going 300mph
* bought one of those light therapy lamps bc i live somewhere where the sun forgot to exist. use it while working, brain actually feels awake now ( also works on the morning)
* started writing shit down by hand instead of typing. something about it makes ur brain process stuff better, idk the science but it works
* got a time-locking container for my phone. sounds extreme but it works. lock that up for 4 hours and watch ur brain come back online

social media detox but make it realistic:

* instead of deleting apps us them as learning experience
* find similar apps that build on existing habits but use your scrolling/listening habits for good
   * [**Hivemind**](http://gethivemind.app) \- Teaches you topics via a generated feed. Basically private reddit. Effective af
   * [**NotebookLM**](http://notebooklm.google) \- PDF to Podcasts or Mindmaps
   * **PDFtoBrainrot** \- several providers. fun to play around with
* blocked reddit during work hours
* turned off all notifications except calls/texts from actual humans. ur brain doesn't need to know every time someone likes ur tweet

big brain hacks:

* found out most of my brain fog was from mouth breathing at night . fixed my nose breathing, sleep actually works now
* started taking lions mane supplements (not the sketchy kind). took like 2 weeks but memory got way better
* learned about ""ultradian rhythm"" - basically work in 90 min blocks then take actual breaks. stops ur brain from feeling fried
* started doing ""mind dumps"" before bed - write down everything in ur brain so it stops spinning when ur trying to sleep. game changer

the most underrated tips:

* fix ur posture. ur neck position affects blood flow to ur brain. got one of those laptop stands + better chair and it helped more than expected
* get ur eyes checked had minor vision problems i didn't know about, fixing that reduced my headaches by like 90%
* started using ""binaural beats"" while working (sounds like some hippie thign but there's actual science behind it). helps me focus way better

bonus tip that sounds fake but trust: chew gum while studying/working. increases blood flow to ur brain (i guess) . works surprisingly well when u need to focus",8,1751397269.0,GetStudying,2,0.9,False

I‚Äôm not asking for a U.S. promo code ‚Äî I just think it‚Äôs reasonable to expect comparable pricing or at least a goodwill adjustment when the same product is being sold at such different values.

Has anyone else had this experience? Did you manage to get a better resolution? Honestly, it‚Äôs kind of disappointing to feel like Canadian customers are treated as an afterthought.

I used to sit near the window with my earbuds in either my usual sony wired ones or my tribit flybuds if I remembered to charge them.

It‚Äôs been a while since I last flew, but lately I‚Äôve been trying to recreate that vibe on rainy days at home. Jazz, ambient sounds, a cup of coffee, maybe a book I don‚Äôt actually plan to finish. No actual destination, just that same quiet in-between feeling.

Everyone thought Terence Keller loved me to the core.I used to feel the same until I discovered I was merely a substitute for his true love.......","**Chapter 1**

My fiance fucked his first love on our wedding bed, I decided to replace him in the wedding. Everyone thought Terence Keller loved me to the core.I used to feel the same until I discovered I was merely a substitute for his true love.After I miscarried because of her, I finally decided to let go.I called the wedding planner and said, ""Hi, I'd like to change both the wedding venue and the groom's name.""Then I called my mom. ""Mom, about that arranged marriage you talked to me before? I'm in. I'll be back soon.""\*\*\*""Ms. Poole, just to double-check... Are you going to change the wedding venue and the groom's name?""My colleague told me you wanted those decorations removed, too. I was worried that she might have misheard...""Before the wedding planner could continue, Amanda Poole interrupted, ""Yeah. That's what I said.""The wedding planner was a bit surprised. It was common to have the wedding venue changed, but changing the groom was a first for her.After a brief pause, she asked, ""Alright then, Ms. Poole. We'll start making arrangements now if that's OK. It's only a month before the wedding, and we gotta hurry up.""Amanda's eyelashes fluttered slightly as she sensed the wedding planner's tentative tone.Then she said, ""Alright. Sorry for the trouble.""After hanging up the phone, she looked up at her reflection in the mirror. She was dressed in a French haute couture diamond-encrusted wedding dress with exquisite makeup and a shining crown, but no trace of joy that a bride-to-be should have could be seen in her eyes at all.""Ms. Poole? Have you done changing?""The shop assistant's voice snapped Amanda back to reality, and then she walked out of the fitting room.The shop assistant's eyes lit up as she saw Amanda in the wedding dress.Then she praised Amanda enthusiastically. ""You look fabulous, Ms. Poole. It took the designer Mr. Keller hired six months to finally customize the dress, and every detail about it is perfect. Others might be overshadowed by it when wearing it, but not you. You look amazing.""In the next second, Terence looked over and was amazed.Even his eyes were glistening with tears.""Amanda, you're so beautiful. After six years, finally, you're about to be my wife.""Feeling him holding her hand, Amanda looked up and met his gaze filled with affection.They started dating when they were students; over the years, they had gone through a lot and still were in deep love, which was something many people were jealous about.He must have loved her to the core that he was almost bursting into tears when seeing her in a wedding dress.She would have fallen for his facade if not for that incident.Terence asked her with concern, ""Is the headpiece too heavy? I know you think it's troublesome, but we only get to take wedding photos once in this lifetime, right? You can take that off after the shooting.""""Gee, you're like the most loving couple I've ever seen,"" the staff sighed. Then she reminded them, ""Shall we go take the photos now? The photographer is ready.""Before Amanda could say no, Terence's phone rang.He glanced at his phone screen, and his expression changed slightly. Then he subconsciously turned off the screen. Though he did it quickly, Amanda still saw that name on the screen-Abigail.Smiling, Terence put his phone away, let go of her hand, and said casually, ""Just a second. I'll go make a call.""Before she could say anything, he had already stridden away. After a few minutes, he came back, looking troubled. ""Amanda, something came up at work. I'm afraid we can't do this today. Can we reschedule?""The staff said, ""Mr. Keller, there won't be enough time...""Amanda remained silent, but Terence took her reaction as agreement. He put her bag on the table and then lowered his head to kiss her.She gripped the hem of the dress so hard that her nails dug into her palms, hurting her, yet she tilted her head away expressionlessly as if she hadn't felt pain at all.""Go on then, if you're in a hurry,"" she said flatly.Terence was slightly surprised that she dodged his kiss; figuring that she was throwing a tantrum, he smiled helplessly.""Amanda, you're like a baby as ever. I'm sorry. I promise I'll be with you no matter what comes up.""She looked at his retreating figure and then lowered her head, smiling self-mockingly. It turned out she was the only one looking forward to this carefully prepared wedding.Amanda knew it was coming, but seeing that wedding dress, she couldn't help but feel sarcastic. At first, she wanted to put a nice end to their six-year relationship.But now, she suddenly had a change of mind.She'd vanish totally from Terence's life along with all the traces proving they had been in love.Looking at her, the staff said hesitantly, ""Ms. Poole, would you like to continue with the dress fitting?""She nodded. ""Of course. Bring out the most expensive ones.""Even without him here, I'm still gonna get married.""

**Chapter 2**

After trying on the wedding dresses, Amanda walked out of the bridal shop, and the sky had already darkened. She stood on the roadside hailing for a cab when she heard the whispers from passers-by.""It's the 9th today. No wonder there are so many people out on the streets. On the evening of this day every month, Mr. Keller will put on a drone light show for his fiancee. It's become a popular check-in spot in L.A.""""Indeed. Mr. Keller and his fiancee love each other so much. They say that he auctioned off a huge diamond ring for her some time ago, right? It cost him a fortune. There aren't many perfect men like him these days.""""Look! The show has begun.""Hearing their exclamations, Amanda looked up, only to see dozens of drones in the sky not far away. The drones first formed ""T loves A"" and then transformed into two little figures.Amidst everyone's sighs, Amanda lowered her head, her eyes brimming with tears as bitterness filled her heart.On the surface, Terence was very nice to her, and he was always so generous when it came to money. So, everyone, including her, believed that he loved her to the core.But now she realized the letter ""A"" probably stood for Abigail instead of Amanda. She came from a rich family and had always been surrounded by suitors ever since she was a student. But she wasn't interested in relationships; also, her parents had a verbal engagement arranged for her. So, she had never said yes to anyone.Then she met Terence.Compared to the others, he wasn't exactly outstanding. When they met, he was just a poor student with good grades, and he had never confessed his feelings for her. He'd just put a cup of coffee on her desk every morning.Once, she said casually that she wanted the cupcakes from the brand ""Chef's Choice"", and he saved up for a long time before buying some and having one of their classmates give them to her.She suffered from menstrual pain, so he put painkillers on her desk during those few days.Occasionally, when she forgot to finish her homework, he'd do it for her by copying her handwriting.When she found out about it, she said he didn't have to do this, but he stubbornly continued.She wasn't a cold robot or a machine and gradually wavered under his relentless pursuit.And he had never let her down. After they got together, he always treated her as the most precious treasure in the world. Even during his startup days, no matter how poor he was, he'd buy her all kinds of small gifts because he knew romance meant a lot to her.When he proposed to her, he even offered to transfer his company shares to her.That day, he looked at her sincerely. ""Amanda, I wanna provide you with the utmost sense of security. Will you marry me?""Smiling, she cried and nodded.But she didn't accept the shares because his love for her was the only thing she wanted.She had thought they'd live happily together forever.However, she forgot that people changed.A month ago, she found out that he had a lover.They went shopping together, looking no different from a couple in love. The way he protected her head when she got into the car reminded Amanda of the way he had protected her back in the day.Back then, Amanda had asked him why he chose the 9th of every month for the drone show.He said it was the day he started having feelings for her. But now she knew it was the day he and his lover got together officially.She looked down at the diamond ring in her bag, closing her eyes [bitterly.Now](http://bitterly.Now) that he had broken his promise, why should she cling to it?That night, Terence came home very late.He was slightly surprised to see her packing in the living room.He said, his voice a bit deep, ""Amanda, why aren't you asleep yet? Are you still upset about the shooting? I'm sorry, but it was urgent, and I had to go.""While coaxing her, he took out a cake box behind him and smiled, making a joke, ""Or are you staying up late because you know I went to buy you your favorite cake?""When he leaned closer to her, she saw the hickeys on his neck, and the perfume he used to mask the scent sickened her.Her heart ached, and she dodged from his embrace.She didn't want to be anywhere near him, not after he just had sex with someone else.Terence was stunned; then he saw her grim face.He asked, ""Are you feeling unwell, Amanda? You look so pale.""She forced a smile. ""No, I'm not. I was just thinking about things.""He tapped her nose gently, not dwelling on it.""You focus on the wedding too much. Leave the rest to the staff, OK? I'm so looking forward to waiting for my beautiful bride on the red carpet.""His sweet nothings didn't cheer her up at all.Since she had decided to replace the groom, of course, there wouldn't be a wedding for them.

**Chapter 3**

The next morning, Amanda woke up and saw Terence, who was adjusting his attire in front of the mirror.She loved seeing him in a shirt, so he dressed simply most of the time. But today, he dressed so flamboyantly.Noticing that she was awake, he instinctively walked over and kissed her lips. But she tilted her face, and he ended up pecking her forehead.He didn't mind; instead, he smiled and continued to pick a tie.In the next second, the screen of his phone on the nightstand lit up, and since he didn't lock it, she saw a chatting interface.The contact name was ""Honey"", and the message Honey sent was, ""You're so bad. Why were you so eager last night? I just bought the dress, and you ruined it. What am I supposed to wear today?""So, the reason why he dressed up today was that he had a date. Feeling bitter, Amanda suddenly realized it wasn't the WhatsApp account he usually used.Before she could dwell on it, Terence had already walked over to the bedside. He subconsciously glanced at the nearly dimmed phone screen and pulled a long face.""Did you snoop on my phone?"" he asked.Looking at how angry he was, she suddenly remembered that back then, he had her fingerprint recorded on his phone and said he had no secrets from her.He knew she never checked his phone but still had an alt account. Was it because he was worried that she might find out?With that thought, she looked up at him, feeling puzzled. If he still cared about her, why did he cheat on her?How much of his love was real? Did he still love her at all? She had no idea.After he left, she sent home several suitcases she had prepared the night before.Then she sorted out things that were related to him and planned on donating them.Six years wasn't exactly a short time; before she realized it, the villa had already been filled with their memories.Back then, they agreed to make this villa their wedding place, and then Terence transferred it to her name. Now that she was determined to make a clean break with him, of course, she wouldn't want the villa.Taking the documents, she went to the registration office to transfer the villa.The staff asked, ""You'll receive the new property certificate in about a week or so. Would you like to come here to pick it up, or do you want us to mail it to you?""She said, ""Mail it to this address.""She figured that the day Terence received the property certificate would be the second day after she left, and she hoped he liked this gift.He was indeed considerate, and there was always a gift for her on anniversaries or holidays. But he was also so careless that when they were choosing the wedding venue, he simply left her with a black card and told her to pick a site she liked. And then, he never asked about it. Now she knew it was because his attention had been attracted by someone else.She unconsciously tightened her grip on the bag. Sadness mixed with disappointment made her feel dizzy.She stood outside in the wind for a long time and then went to the class reunion. When she was about to push open the door to the private room, she heard teases.""You've put on wedding rings already? When are you getting married? This year, maybe?""""Terence, come on. Abigail has always been the one you love, right? Then why did you date Amanda? Now that everyone has known, and it's troublesome to break up with her.""""Terence, I'm so surprised that you've had a crush on Abigail for so long. Now that she has come back, you can finally pick up where you left off.""Noticing the displeased look on Terence's face, Abigail Hawkins quickly said sweetly while leaning against his arms, ""I don't think a title matters a lot. Anything is fine as long as he loves me.""Terence echoed, smiling while lowering his head to kiss her, ""You know I can give you everything besides marriage.""The others realized they had said the wrong thing and quickly said, ""Yeah, marriage is just a formality. Abigail, you're the only one Terence has ever loved. Guys like him are rare creatures these days. You've got great taste in men.""Standing outside the door, Amanda was stupefied by what she had heard, feeling as if her blood had frozen.Terence and Abigail got together before this year?In other words, her relationship with Terence was a complete lie ever since the beginning.All those sweet moments and happy memories suddenly turned into a big hand, slapping her face hard and destroying the last bit of her rationality.Back then, Terence said he had nothing but his love for her; he promised he'd love her and protect her forever. So, she willingly chose to stay by his side when he started from scratch.It wasn't until now that she realized she was the only one who took their six-year relationship seriously.Until a passing waiter handed her a tissue tentatively, she realized she was crying.She wiped her tears away and pushed open the door.Hearing the sound, Terence instinctively pushed Abigail away, looking flustered.""Amanda? When did you get here?""

**Chapter 4**

Everyone paused for a second, then quickly invited the two to sit down.""Amanda, what brings you here today? We invited you several times, but Terence refused.""Amanda was pulled to sit next to Terence. But before she could speak, Terence took her fork and wiped it, then brought her a plate of fruit.Terence replied with a smile, ""Of course, I won't show my girlfriend to you guys. Amanda, try this. It's your favorite orange.""Amanda remained silent, not wanting to join their act. ""I suddenly remember I have something else to do. Please enjoy your meal. I'll leave first.""Terence quickly held her hand, frowning.""Where are you going? I'll give you a ride.""Abigail kept silent, and she suddenly said with a smile, ""Amanda probably looks down on us, right? She never came to our party after graduation, and now she thinks a meal is a waste of time.""""Yes, Amanda. We rarely get together. Why do you rush to leave?""""We and Abigail have only been in the same class for a year, but she came to our party every time. Come on! Terence is here too. Are you leaving to see another man?""They seemed to think it was funny, and they continued to talk about this, ""Which man is better than our Terence? Is that man so hot?""""Come on! Amanda is a rich girl. She can date different types of men if she wants. Who says she can only date one man?""Seeing Abigail's provocative face, Amanda felt disgusted.""Enough! Amanda is my fiancee. Your jokes are too much! Mind your own business!""Terence's expression was serious with real anger, and he quickly comforted Amanda with a gentle tone.""Let's go home.""Amanda suddenly felt a bit wistful, as if back to the time when Terence used to protect her.But in the next second, Abigail suddenly fell to the ground with a scream.Terence immediately turned to chase after Abigail, saying, ""Amanda, wait me for a second.""""OK. Go ahead.""Terence frowned and then really left.Amanda sneered. His love was really cheap.Amanda's phone rang. She looked down, receiving a text message from an unknown number.""Let him go. He doesn't love you. What's the point of forcing him to stay with you? Tomorrow is your birthday. Dare to make a bet? Guess if he will be with you or in my bed?""Amanda smiled lightly, replying quickly this time.""OK, I bet with you.""""If I lose, you can take him away. If I win, I'll also let him go to you.""At the same time, Abigail felt a bit strange. She frowned and thought, ""This woman was crazy?""Amanda didn't receive a further reply, and she smiled mockingly.When the prize of victory was no longer attractive, winning or losing was also meaningless.She wouldn't compromise this time.At midnight, Amanda's phone started vibrating.She received so many birthday wishes, from family, friends, and business partners, and she even received the generous money transfer from her mysterious fiance.Only Terence was missing.Even though Amanda was ready for that, she still felt heartbroken.Where was Terence? Abigail quickly gave her the answer.In the photo, the man was kneeling on the ground, carefully tending to Abigail's leg wound.""As long as I get a little hurt, I can call him over. Amanda, why are you so worthless?""Amanda turned off her phone, looking at the wedding photo on the bedside. Her heart was numb.In the photo, she was holding a bouquet of white lilies. She was embraced by a man full of love.Terence used to promise her, ""The white lily's meaning is 'loyalty and unity, forever together', symbolizing pure and flawless love, just like you and me. Amanda, I only love you in this life. I will never let you down.""Now his promise was given to someone else, as well as his love.

**Chapter 5**

Every year, Terence would hold a birthday party for Amanda, and this year was no exception.Amanda sat in front of the mirror, listening to the crowd's envious praise, but she was so calm.""Mr. Keller is so sweet to you. He ordered custom jewelry this year, and I heard it's so expensive. You must be the most dazzling woman tonight.""""Yes, Mr. Keller spends a lot of money every year. Everyone in L.A. knows how sweet Mr. Keller and Ms. Poole are. It's really enviable.""The makeup artist stopped what she was doing. She smiled and cut off her assistant's words, reminding Amanda, ""OK, Ms. Poole, hurry up and change your clothes. I heard the guests arrive.""Amanda changed her dress and went downstairs, seeing everyone gathered together.Abigail was in a sky-blue dress. Terence's suit was in the same color. They stand together at the center of the circle of people, shining like stars.Someone noticed Amanda and whispered a few words, and the crowd dispersed instantly.Amanda's face was expressionless as if she didn't see the two people quickly stop holding hands and Terence's slightly nervous movements.Terence came to welcome her. He smiled and said, ""Amanda, you're so stunning tonight.""Terence coaxed Amanda over. ""Well, it's time for our host to start the ceremony. Remember the champagne you liked when we traveled last time? I used it for the champagne tower this year. You'll love it.""Amanda staggered for a moment. So, Terence worked so hard to prepare this.Amanda opened her mouth, trying to say something. Maybe they can end their relationship on good terms. But then Terence suddenly glanced at his phone. His expression slightly changed.Amanda got silent. She turned to start the party herself.She took the wine, and stood on the stage, looking at Terence. He quietly left with Abigail. A mocking smile was on Abigail's face.Amanda didn't know if she should say Terence was brave. He can take the risk for Abigail.The crowd's envious praise turned into sharp sarcasm.""Mr. Keller spent so much on his fiancee. Even the wine is made to her taste. It's really a sweet couple.""Amanda lowered her eyes, pouring wine into the champagne tower. After a round of applause, people came over to talk to her.When the party was over, she leaned on the table. When she looked up, she found Abigail standing on the stairs.Abigail showed a smug smile, walking downstairs step by step towards Amanda. Abigail's face flushed, eyes full of desire and joy.Amanda looked at her approaching. Abigail had an ambiguous smile. ""I helped you try the wedding room. The bed is very solid and very soft.""Amanda went limp, feeling dizzy and disgusting.Seeing Terence coming over, Abigail whispered in Amanda's ear, ""Just give up. He never belonged to you.""Abigail suddenly cried, ""Amanda, I know you blame me for taking Terence away last time, but I really want to apologize to you...""After saying that, she held Amanda's hand, forcing herself backward, hitting the champagne tower on the table.When Amanda realized what was happening, Abigail was already lying in the broken glass, covered in blood.Terence rushed over in a panic, pushing Amanda aside. ""Abigail! Are you OK? Don't be afraid, I'm here!""Ignoring the guests who looked over, Terence held Abigail in pain, looking at Amanda with disappointment.""Amanda, I know you don't like Abigail, but how could you do this!""

**Chapter 6**

Amanda winced in pain. Her waist hit the corner of the table, sending sharp pain through her abdomen. She collapsed onto the broken glass, blood instantly staining the floor. Amanda couldn't tell if it was her body or her heart that hurt more.""It wasn't me. You can check the surveillance.""She looked at the pale and unconscious Abigail, then looked at the anxious Terence. Amanda asked with tears in her eyes, ""Do you not trust me at all?""""Terence, let's break up.""It seemed Terence couldn't bear to see Amanda's painful expression, but he quickly hardened his resolve.""Amanda, don't be angry. I don't want to doubt you, but there's no one else here, and she was hurt at your birthday party. No matter what happened, we should be responsible for her.""After saying this, Terence realized Abigail in his arms already fainted. His face turned anxious.""Abigail has a special blood type. Getting a little hurt can be life-threatening. She wouldn't dare to frame you by using her life, right? This time is your fault. I won't blame you. But stop your nonsense. I'll take her to the hospital first!""Terence strode away, leaving the party behind, and once again leaving Amanda behind.The guests watched this scene with strange and sympathetic eyes. It hurt Amanda deeply.Amanda's forehead was covered in sweat, and then she couldn't control herself to faint.She woke up in the hospital. The doctor checked her wound, but she still felt very dizzy and uncomfortable.The doctor spoke with some pity, ""Ms. Poole, I'm sorry we failed to save your child.""Amanda stared blankly at the ceiling. She unconsciously put her hands on her abdomen. She once had a child here.Tears filled her face. She finally couldn't hold back her laughter.How ridiculous! Today should be the happiest day of her life, but in the end, her child died because of its father.But seeing her current relationship with Terence, perhaps losing the child was the best choice.After receiving the miscarriage form, Amanda ignored the pain and pulled out the needle. She saw countless missed calls, but she also ignored them.She was about to leave the hospital, but she suddenly stopped.Amanda saw Terence was holding Abigail. His voice was nervous.""Can you stay in the hospital another day? Those glass pieces were just taken out, and it takes time to recover.""""I want to go back to our home. And...you don't wanna have sex with me?"" Abigail asked Terence, looking at him shyly. Then she pretended to be sad. ""There has been a lot of negative coverage about Amanda in the media. You should go to comfort her.""Terence's throat tightened. He leaned down and kissed Abigail, then gasped, ""I've already called to clear things up with her over the phone. This time is all her fault.""Terence whispered something to Abigail, causing both their faces to flush with desire.Amanda looked up, tears welling up in her eyes. She painfully watched the two people's intimacy.When Amanda wanted out of the hospital, she immediately saw the two people being stopped by the media outside.Seeing Amanda wrapped in a bandage in the hospital, Terence first felt nervous, then quickly attracted by the woman in his arms. He turned to yell at Amanda.""Why didn't you answer the phone? Didn't I tell you to explain everything early? How could the media suddenly come to the hospital? I really didn't expect you to be so malicious!""Abigail just got out of the hospital. She can't handle the media. You have to solve this yourself!""Amanda was too stunned to react and was pushed out the door by Terence, quickly overwhelmed by the reporters.In front of her were hands reaching out, microphones hitting her body and forehead, Amanda's head throbbing with pain, and she saw Terence holding Abigail leaving.Amanda sneered. Even if she was already disappointed, she still felt heartbroken at this moment.Fortunately, there were only two days left.

**Chapter 7**

The public was very interested in their relationship, so many reporters came here.Amanda was pushed by the crowd. Her already pale face got even colder. Surrounded by endless questions, she had no answer. She could only dodge, looking miserable.Amanda saw Terence on the news until that night.The video showed her desperately dodging the cameras on the one hand and showed Terence clarifying to the public on the other hand. He was handsome in a suit. This was quite ironic.""My relationship with Amanda is very stable, and our wedding is in a couple of days. Thank you all for your concern.""Amanda closed her eyes, feeling quite desolate in this big villa.Her phone buzzed. Abigail sent her a photo of two people kissing under the fireworks.""Look at this. He only cares about me. He was afraid I was not happy, so he took me to set off fireworks. And he just used you to protect me.""That was why Terence didn't clarify during the daytime because he took Abigail to the suburbs.Amanda stared at the photo for a while, suddenly remembering the scenes when they just started to date.At that time, Terence wanted to surprise her, so he worked overtime for a month, saving money to take her to Disneyland to see the fireworks.He always said his love was not enough. His Amanda deserved the best.They kissed in the night, telling each other their love. They were full of passion.Now he could easily give a grand firework to others. His love also instantly faded like fireworks.Terence had done a lot for Amanda before, but she no longer wanted to doubt who he really cared about.Since she didn't care, how could she be hurt again?Terence came back the next day. Seeing Amanda become thin, his face was full of worry.""Amanda, how did you get hurt like this? Yesterday I didn't notice you. It was my fault. But Abigail was hurt because of you. I can't leave her alone.""Terence came over to hold Amanda. He thought she might hurt herself to irritate him. He continued to speak, ""I asked the chef to make a nutritious meal. You should eat and take care of yourself. You said you want to take some wedding photos. Let's go today, OK?""Amanda was pulled to sit at the table, unable to refuse.But the meal was not ready yet, and Terence's phone suddenly vibrated. He looked at Amanda apologetically.""It's probably something with the company. I'll handle it first.""After Terence left, he didn't come back again. He just sent a message saying he suddenly had to deal with some work.Amanda didn't ask and just looked at the chat history Abigail sent her.""It seems like the media is following me. I'm scared. Did I cause you trouble?""""Don't worry. I'll come up now.""Amanda didn't know if Terence was worried about the exposure of their affair or if Abigail couldn't handle the media. No matter which situation it was, this made her seem pathetic.She took a deep breath, silently wiping away all traces of her life in the villa.She packed all the things she could take and donated the rest of them. Looking at all her photos with Terence burned, Amanda felt relieved.She turned on her new phone and sent the flight information to her family. Amanda put her old phone with all their chat history, the miscarriage form, and printed photos on the bed. Then she picked up her suitcase and left.This villa was once full of love and memories. But now, staying here made her sick.Amanda left and didn't look back again.On the way to the airport, Amanda saw Terence going back to the villa. His car was parked by the roadside. Even the car door was not closed. Abigail cried in his arms. It looked like they just went through a fight.It had nothing to do with her now. Amanda calmly raised the window. Her gaze no longer stopped for Terence.Terence's heart suddenly slowed, as if feeling something. He looked back, but only saw a strange black car.He unconsciously called out, ""Amanda...""In his arms, Abigail was frozen. She hid the resentment in her eyes, saying with a trembling voice, ""Are they all gone? Did I cause you trouble?""Terence turned back to Abigail and comforted her, ""I'm here. Don't worry. I'll take you back now.""Amanda looked at the rearview mirror, seeing the two shrinking figures, and then closed her eyes for a second. Terence, never see you again.

From there, I can see the dining room and kitchen. My in-laws are currently visiting, along with my two nieces. I have two sons, ages 18 and 20.

I typically wake up early and go straight to work. Everyone else starts waking up later, and my wife cooks breakfast for everyone. This morning, my 20-year-old, who had an early college class, came back home and as he walked in, my wife cheerfully said, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs your breakfast‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt forget about you.‚Äù

I happened to walk into the kitchen around that time and said, ‚ÄúYou forgot about me, huh?‚Äù Her response was, ‚ÄúWell, I figured you already had breakfast yourself.‚Äù She knows my routine‚Äîcoffee and maybe a quick slice of toast as I head straight into my office. Then she started scraping together a few leftover items and said, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt forget.‚Äù

When I replied, ‚ÄúNever mind,‚Äù (I don‚Äôt want to be anyones afterthought) she turned to everyone and said, ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt want anything.‚Äù  I did not make a fuss or say anything more.

My husband and I decided to be in an open relationship a year ago, and yes I was on board with it. I never partied or slept around, never had one night stands or anything and I met my husband when I was 19. So this has opened up feeling good about myself and I guess I like the attention, plus I‚Äôve always been a ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù so it was nice to do something considered taboo. No one I know would ever think I‚Äôd be doing something like this. Anyway, my dad passed away the end of last year and it was completely unexpected. I was super close to him so I lost a part of myself. At that point I lost my sex drive and then instantly felt guilt for the lifestyle I was in and wanted to stop. I talked to my husband about it and of course he still wanted to sleep around, typical guy. I didn‚Äôt have any worries about our bond so I was fine with it. We had boundaries set that condoms were required, no overnights, and no saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù or if one of the partners developed feelings, the relationship would need to end. I was looking for something along the lines of a girl he would take out to dinner, get a hotel and hook up, then come home. We had that with a woman and it was great until she was expecting to be spoiled and that wasn‚Äôt our thing. So then he looked online and met a married woman who wanted to cheat on her husband. They got along well and I started voicing my concerns about him texting her too much since that‚Äôs too personal. He shut me down since I had an online relationship, that I never met in person, and I considered it different since he was actually meeting up with her in person and I was worried it would turn into more. I let him go on a cruise with this woman and consoled him when she wasn‚Äôt giving him the most attention on the trip. She was with a group of friends and would sneak off to meet him occasionally. He didn‚Äôt think it would be like that or he wouldn‚Äôt have gone. So he was mostly on the phone with me the whole trip. He ended the trip on better terms with her and then they continued their relationship by texting daily and occasionally meeting up for coffee or dinner and then a hotel session. Well, I started noticing little things about his behavior and every time I would confront him, he would instantly shut me down and compare it to my online bf. Would never validate how I felt and just kept turning it around on me and saying I was jealous. Valentine‚Äôs Day rolled around and he went put with her the day after and I noticed a feeling in my gut again. I looked through his messages, yes, we allow each other to do that since we like to be open, and I saw that they had been saying ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù I instantly confronted him, not ideally since he was on the road to work, but he didn‚Äôt deny it and said it didn‚Äôt mean he loved me any less.  But he didn‚Äôt want to tell me because he knew he‚Äôd have to leave that relationship and obviously he didn‚Äôt want that to happen. So I gave him an ultimatum it was either me or her. He chose me, but took all day to cry it out and didn‚Äôt know how to say goodbye to her. Then he blamed me for making them breakup and it took me a month to realize that he ultimately cheated on me by breaking trust and boundaries and then blamed me for it. He requested marriage counseling and we did that, but he never admitted how he was wrong. Told me he missed her because she filled a void I don‚Äôt. That hurt. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm not enough for him. He said my online bf fills my void and I said I just do it for fun, he doesn‚Äôt fill a void for me. I don‚Äôt need him. I feel like we didn‚Äôt get enough out of counseling, but it was racking up a huge bill so we stopped. I felt ok at that point because he did leave her and he told me each time she reached out to him on different platforms so I felt he was proving to me that he would do whatever it takes. Fast forward to now, June, and we‚Äôre both back in the lifestyle and playing with other couples. We have discussed and decided to only play with each other going forward. There‚Äôs a couple we have become really great friends with and can do vanilla hang outs and have a great time in the bedroom. However, it has turned into a separate room, separate house situation because of all of us having kids and finding babysitters is difficult. So last time we swapped partners and houses. My hubby went to their house and the other husband came to our house. It was fun and exciting. But then my husband had told the wife that he was going to be in the city during the week and she should come join him for fun in a hotel‚Ä¶ without talking to me about it. I confronted him about it and said I wasn‚Äôt comfortable because we were supposed to be doing this together and I didn‚Äôt want him forming feelings again for another woman. He was instantly mad and said I will never get over what he did to me. I really just want him to understand, but at this point I‚Äôm not sure he ever will. I was so close to leaving with the last incident with his gf, but I considered how hard it‚Äôs going to be as a single mom. I can‚Äôt talk to anyone about this and it‚Äôs eating me alive. We never had any arguments before the lifestyle and now when I try to talk to him, it blows up. It‚Äôs like at this point, could we ever go back to a vanilla life? If I decide not to be in the lifestyle anymore, I know he‚Äôs going to want to and then he‚Äôll resent me. And then I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôll just cheat on me and do it anyways. Am I overthinking this? I like seeing him with other women, I‚Äôm just afraid of the emotional attachment and he became easily attached in the past. ",1,1751396726.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

I tried black coffee but sometimes I just need something sweet in the morning. Used to use brown sugar. I do decaf coffee + 1-2 packs of Splenda + 1 spoon of coffee mate. 

I usually always have scrambled eggs in the morning but I replaced it with non stick cooking spray to cut down on oil. Also gonna try to get just egg whites on my next grocery run. 

Lunch - I live with my family and mom usually always cooks. She makes white rice, some type of curry (either fish or chicken or vegetables). I‚Äôll have one cup of rice ( I measure for accuracy), 1-2 cups of fire roasted vegetables I got from Costco, and whatever curry my mom cooked. 

Mid afternoon snack - black Lipton tea, Splenda and coffee mate. Pizza (1 tortilla, ketchup, Mexican cheese, and some fire roasted veggies on top). 

Dinner - same as lunch as most days. 1/2 cup or 1 cup of white rice. Fish chicken or vegetables and I‚Äôll also have the fire roasted veggies so that I eat less rice. 

Note: Although my mom cooks a lot, I‚Äôve been thinking of cooking as well just so I‚Äôm 100% sure what‚Äôs in it (oil and whatnot). My mom doesn‚Äôt use more oil than needed however as she also tries to keep our meals healthy.

In a world filled with financial chaos, economic jargon, and graphs that look like spaghetti, one hero rises above the noise: the cute cat. But what do adorable felines have to do with Bitcoin ATMs and QR codes, you ask? Sit tight, friend‚Äîwe‚Äôre about to connect the dots like a whiskered blockchain detective.

Let‚Äôs begin with the basics: cats. They rule the internet, knock things off desks with reckless abandon, and somehow still convince us they deserve treats after destroying our furniture. These fluffy overlords have become the unofficial mascots of the crypto community‚Äîbecause like Bitcoin, they don‚Äôt follow anyone‚Äôs rules. Independent, unpredictable, and occasionally majestic, cats are basically decentralized finance with fur.

Now enter the **Bitcoin ATM**. It's like a regular ATM, but instead of spitting out crumpled twenties, it lets you buy Bitcoin on the spot. Kind of like a vending machine for digital gold. Picture this: you walk into a coffee shop, pet a cat snoozing in the window, and notice a shiny Bitcoin ATM tucked in the corner. You feel powerful. You‚Äôre part of the future. And then it hits you‚Äîyou need a way to spend or share your newfound crypto treasure.

That‚Äôs where our secret weapon comes in: the [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker app**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com). It‚Äôs fast, fun, and as easy to use as a cat meme. Just enter your wallet address, customize the colors to match your vibe (may we suggest ‚Äúblush pink #8‚Äù for maximum cuteness), and boom‚Äîyou‚Äôve got a sleek, scannable QR code ready to be printed, shared, or framed next to your cat‚Äôs latest Instagram glamour shot.

QR codes make it effortless to receive Bitcoin‚Äîwhether you're selling crafts at a market, running a side hustle, or fundraising for a cat shelter that accepts crypto (yes, that‚Äôs a thing). And our app doesn‚Äôt just generate boring black-and-white codes‚Äîit lets your style shine through, with background colors, borders, and designs that look so good, even your cat might stop scrolling to admire them. Okay, maybe not. But you will.

So how do all these pieces fit together? Imagine this:

* You adopt a rescue cat and name her Satoshi.
* You post cute photos of Satoshi online. People fall in love.
* You slap a Bitcoin QR code on your profile‚Äîgenerated using [our app](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).
* Suddenly, random internet strangers start sending you tips just for being awesome.
* You cash out via a Bitcoin ATM and buy Satoshi a gold-plated litter box. Win-win.

In conclusion: life‚Äôs better with cute cats, easy QR codes, and a few satoshis in your wallet.

1lpa4zm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1lpa4zm/the_scroll_keeper_chapter_1_the_countdown_begins/,The Scroll Keeper - Chapter 1: The Countdown Begins,"Daniel Thorne was just an average guy. He drove trucks for a living, and his life was pretty boring. Days on the road, nights at cheap motels, or playing video games in his small apartment with the TV on in the background. That afternoon was the same as always. He was hauling a shipment of refrigerators down I-95, the heater barely on, and some classic rock playing quietly in the cab.

Outside, the highway was lined with bright fall leaves. Traffic was heavy as people rushed home before dark. The sun was low, stretching long shadows across the road and washing everything in a warm orange glow. You could tell from the air that winter wasn‚Äôt far off.

But then it happened.

There was no flash of light, no thunderclap, no warning at all. Just an abrupt stillness in Daniel‚Äôs chest, like the moment before a car crash when time stretches too far. A pressure built behind his eyes, and then he felt it. It was a kind of presence, not physical, but you can tell it was something.

A voice entered his mind, not through his ears, but like it came from his thoughts. He couldn‚Äôt look away from the road, yet he wasn‚Äôt seeing it anymore.

**""Attention, inhabitants of Earth. Your planet has been classified as a Tier-1 Resource Planet under Intergalactic Mining Directive 2280. Primary resource designation: Blackvein.""**

The voice was emotionless and mechanical, but it also felt intelligent at the same time.

**""All humans will be transported to the Tutorial Realm in 11 hours and 59 minutes for processing. During planetary terraforming, all non-essential products from humans (buildings, transportation, technology) will be dismantled for efficient resource extraction. All other Earth species will be eliminated.""**

Daniel blinked, but the words didn‚Äôt go away.

**""One Earth year will pass in the Tutorial Realm. Any human achieving level 40 within this period may petition for planetary sovereignty. Failure will result in permanent resource colony status. Prepare for processing.""**

He nearly veered off the road. The wheel jerked under his grip as he tried to understand what he‚Äôd just heard. A resource colony? Tutorial Realm? Level forty? What kind of alien invasion movie is this?

The radio in his cab stuttered, then exploded with overlapping voices. News anchors shouting over each other, and Daniel‚Äôs phone started to vibrate. The president came on, but his message was garbled, full of static and fear. Somewhere in the mix, a priest was praying, his voice desperate.

Not before long, sirens wailed outside.

A distant boom cracked through the sky. Daniel saw smoke curling into the air over the city skyline.

He pulled over, heart pounding. All around him, other drivers were doing the same. Some were crying while others just sat frozen, hands on the wheel, lips moving as they tried to make sense of it all. Then came the sounds of chaos, metal crunching as a minivan slammed into a stopped car, the high-pitched squeal of tires, the thud of boots on asphalt.

People were pouring out of their vehicles, some in panic, some in shock. A man in a wrinkled business suit ran past Daniel‚Äôs truck, eyes wild, clutching his head like it might split open. A woman in gym clothes screamed into her phone, then hurled it into the grass.

Daniel‚Äôs own hands trembled on the steering wheel. He glanced down and, for the first time, noticed a new screen floating in his vision, like a HUD in a video game.

\*\*\*

Daniel looked at the screen in disbelief. This wasn‚Äôt a dream.

He turned his head slowly, watching as chaos blossomed across the highway. People were fighting and looting other cars. He saw someone rip open a delivery van and start throwing out boxes. Another person pulled a tire iron from their trunk and swung it wildly, screaming about survival and betrayal.

Then came the gunshots. Daniel ducked instinctively, heart slamming against his ribs. A group of teenagers sprinted past his truck, one of them gripping a handgun like he barely knew how to use it. Behind them, an older man bled from his leg, crawling along the pavement, reaching toward the open road like it might carry him away from this madness.

The sky above him dimmed, and whether it was from smoke or something else, Daniel couldn‚Äôt tell. His fingers were still locked around the wheel, but he wasn‚Äôt driving anymore. He wasn‚Äôt even thinking, not really. Just watching and listening to the chaos around him.

A deep rumble echoed from the earth, like thunder underground. Some new signal from the system, or maybe something else.

He thought of his brother in the military, stationed across the world. He probably saw it too, and heard the voice inside his head. He‚Äôs probably the safest on the planet in that military base.

He took a slow breath, leaned forward, and popped open the glove box. Inside, under an old pair of work gloves and a crumpled snack wrapper, was his pistol. A matte-black Wesson Viper 9mm. It was reliable, compact, and not too flashy. He‚Äôd bought it after a string of truck robberies in the area last year. Daniel never actually used it before, it was just something for peace of mind.

He picked it up carefully and pressed the magazine release. It slid out smoothly, and it was a full mag of fifteen rounds. He clicked it back in and checked the safety, still on.

The metal felt heavier than usual.

Daniel stepped out of his truck and crouched, looking around.

The area around him felt like a war zone. The air was thick with smoke now, and the cries of people had grown more desperate. Somewhere nearby, he heard someone pounding on metal. A sharp clang, again and again. He turned and saw a man trying to pry open the back of his truck with a crowbar. The guy looked ragged already, hair wild, blood on his sleeve, and sweat streaking the dirt on his face. The refrigeration unit was sealed tight, and the man was swearing under his breath, teeth gritted as he tried to force the latch open.

Daniel didn‚Äôt care, let him take it. What use were refrigerators now, anyway? Maybe he thought there was food inside, or maybe he was just crazy. Daniel turned and started walking, leaving the man to his work.

He had more important things to do. The thought of his neighbor, Mr. Smith, flashed through his mind. The man was almost eighty, legs ruined from a construction accident years ago, bound to a wheelchair, and living alone in a second-floor apartment. No family, no visitors, just Daniel and the occasional delivery driver. Over the years, the old man had become something like a mentor to him, offering advice when Daniel was down, always there with a hot cup of coffee when he came home late from the road. They weren‚Äôt related, but it didn‚Äôt matter. He owed that man a lot.

Daniel picked his way through the stalled cars and broken glass littering the shoulder. People were fighting on the other side of the road now, clustered near an overturned SUV that had caught fire.

He kept moving. His apartment wasn‚Äôt far, maybe fifteen minutes on foot if he cut through the park and stayed off the main roads. He had ammo there, around two extra boxes of rounds locked in a toolbox under his bed, along with a half-decent survival kit he‚Äôd put together after watching a bunch of prepper videos during a winter haul. Water filters, canned food, and batteries. It wasn‚Äôt much, but it was better than nothing. Enough to hole up until tomorrow when the Tutorial Realm arrives.

Whatever that was going to be.

He walked faster now, past a mall that had already been smashed to pieces. Looters were dragging flat-screen TVs out of shattered windows, laughing like it meant something. A teenager sat on the curb with a baseball bat in his lap, staring blankly at a burning storefront. No one noticed Daniel.

The sky above had darkened to a deep gray, the last light of the sun filtering through the thick smoke. He turned down a narrow side street, where it was a little quieter and the buildings were closer. His boots echoed on the pavement, and the apartment complex was only a few blocks away now.

He adjusted the grip on his pistol and kept moving.

By the time Daniel reached his apartment complex, his boots were scuffed with ashes and dirt, and his shirt was damp with sweat. The complex was no different from the rest of the city. Cars were double-parked across the small lot, trunks flung open, belongings spilling out. Someone had dragged a mattress into the driveway and was wrestling to tie it to the roof of a compact sedan. Screams echoed from somewhere above, while a dog barked nonstop from one of the balconies. Glass crunched under his foot as Daniel stepped through the busted front door. The entryway was wrecked. Mailboxes were torn open, lobby furniture overturned, and the front desk abandoned. Someone had smeared something, maybe blood, on the wall.

He took the stairs two at a time, ignoring the elevator. Daniel immediately went to the second floor to find Mr. Smith.

He knocked hard on the door twice, then leaned in close. ‚ÄúMr. Smith, it‚Äôs Daniel. You in there?‚Äù

There was a pause, but then a familiar voice sounded inside.

‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù

Daniel fished the spare key from the little pouch on his keychain. He‚Äôd been holding onto it for months, ever since Mr. Smith fell trying to change a light bulb and couldn‚Äôt get up for almost an hour. He slipped it into the lock and turned it, easing the door open.

The old man was sitting in his chair by the window, wrapped in a heavy robe, a thick book laid open across his lap. His wheelchair rested nearby, untouched. His eyes found Daniel, and a tired smile creased his face.

‚ÄúWell, I was wondering how long it‚Äôd take you.‚Äù

Daniel stepped in, quickly locking the door behind him. ‚ÄúYou all right?‚Äù

Mr. Smith gave a slow nod, then looked past him toward the hallway. ‚ÄúSounds like the whole damn world‚Äôs coming apart.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is,‚Äù Daniel said, checking the apartment. Everything seemed intact, no one had broken in, at least not yet. ‚ÄúYou've seen the message?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù the old man replied, shutting the book with a quiet thud. ‚ÄúNot something you forget. Don‚Äôt know what the hell half of it means, but it sounds like we‚Äôve been sold off like cattle.‚Äù

Daniel crouched beside the chair. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm moving you to my place. It‚Äôs closer to the stairwell and easier to defend. I‚Äôve got some supplies. We can board it up and ride this out until the aliens take us.‚Äù

Mr. Smith hesitated, looking around. ‚ÄúThis old place has been mine for over twenty years.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. But it won‚Äôt last another day,‚Äù Daniel said softly. ‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt speak much after that. Mr. Smith leaned on Daniel as they moved, the hallway loud with shouts and slamming doors. People were abandoning the building in waves, arms full of clothes, laptops, and old canned food. Where are they going anyway? If the aliens take them, it doesn't matter where you go. No one looked twice at Daniel. Everyone was too busy trying to outrun the end of the world.

Daniel opened his apartment door and guided Mr. Smith inside, settling him into the corner chair with a blanket and a bottle of water. Then he locked the door, bolted it, and shoved a heavy dresser in front for good measure.

He went to work quickly. The toolbox under the bed came out first. He grabbed the ammo boxes and checked the rounds again. Then the hammer, nails, and leftover plywood from when he tried to build a bookshelf last year. He boarded the front windows tightly, then blocked the back ones with furniture. He filled water jugs from the sink, just in case the plumbing gave out, and laid out the flashlight, knives, and duct tape in easy reach. The last thing he checked was his phone. Still no signal or updates, just the countdown ticking in the corner of his vision.

**Time Until Processing: 11 Hours and 15 Minutes**

Outside, the noise grew louder. Daniel moved back to the front door, crouched low with his gun resting in his hands. He peeked through the peephole.

Someone was breaking into other apartments.

He saw a group of three, two men and one woman, all armed. Not military or cops, they look like civilians. One of them fired a shotgun through a door across the hall, then kicked it open with a roar of triumph. Another followed behind, dragging something out.

Daniel backed away from the peephole slowly.

He turned to Mr. Smith, who looked at him with a quiet, grim understanding.

‚ÄúGo to the bedroom,‚Äù Daniel said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll guard the entrance.‚Äù

Then he took a position behind the dresser with his gun raised, heart pounding.

Whatever happened next, he wasn‚Äôt going down without a fight.

1lpa27c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Layoffs/comments/1lpa27c/from_my_blog_about_being_out_of_work_and_the_job/,From my blog about being out of work and the job hunt.,"The Afterlife No One Warned Me About

Five years ago, I think I died.
They tell me I survived COVID, but I suspect that‚Äôs only technically true. I remember the week in the COVID ward of the hospital. I remember the fever, the delirium, the blackness that wasn‚Äôt sleep. My immune system turning against me with septic shock. A near miss. A ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù recovery. But I don‚Äôt think I ever actually came back.
I think this is hell.
It‚Äôs not the hell of fire and pitchforks. It‚Äôs much more elegant, much more diabolical. Hell, it turns out, is waking up every day and having one more thing that mattered to you stripped away, slowly, until there‚Äôs nothing left you even want to wake up for.
First it was my job. My career. My sense of worth, ripped away like an infected bandage. I used to be somebody. I used to have authority, goals, a team, travel, a reason to get up and shave. A paycheck that felt like proof that I mattered. Now? I‚Äôm un-hirable.
I don‚Äôt even know why. Overqualified? Underqualified? Wrong school? Wrong industry? Too broad a background to be a ‚Äúgood fit‚Äù for any one box? I get the same polite rejection letters over and over. The same radio silence. The same empty, deflating ‚Äúyou‚Äôre amazing, but we‚Äôre going in another direction‚Äù from people who once told me how valuable I was.
When you apply to multiple jobs every day for years, you‚Äôre guaranteed one thing: a new rejection every single day. It‚Äôs like signing up to be slapped in the face every morning before coffee.
It seeps in. It stains everything. I go grocery shopping and want to cry in the produce aisle. I wonder why I even deserve to eat. I chew my food and feel the missing tooth I can‚Äôt afford to fix, and with every bite I‚Äôm reminded that I am failing at even basic self-care.
I see people with nice cars, nice houses, vacations, smiles. I think: Did I just make all the wrong decisions in life? Is this what I deserve? Was the imposter syndrome I used to battle actually just realism I ignored?
They say depression is an illness, but what if it‚Äôs just a perfectly sane response to things being actually, objectively, irreversibly terrible? I‚Äôm terrified every single day. And when people talk about depression treatments‚Äînew options, expensive sessions not covered by insurance‚ÄîI want to scream. What‚Äôs the point of treating symptoms when the cause is reality?
When I lost my job, I lost my self-worth. Then went the savings. Then the possessions‚Äîsold off, broken, unrepairable. I‚Äôm waiting, in dread, to see if the house goes next. My marriage. My family. My mind. The path seems clear enough. Lose enough and eventually you lose your life.
Isn‚Äôt that the design here? Isn‚Äôt that the torture?
They don‚Äôt burn you all at once. That would be too easy. They make you watch as everything you built, everything you valued, is systematically taken away.
And all the while people tell you to cheer up.
‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt last forever.‚Äù
‚ÄúSomething will come along.‚Äù
‚ÄúHave you thought about doing something else?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too smart not to land somewhere!‚Äù
What they don‚Äôt realize is I have thought about everything else. I‚Äôve tried everything else. You can‚Äôt sell experience to people who want cheap, green, and easily molded. You can‚Äôt apply for things you‚Äôre ‚Äútoo experienced‚Äù for, and you can‚Äôt get the things you‚Äôre not ‚Äúexactly a fit‚Äù for.
‚ÄúI used to be so big and strong. I used to know my right from wrong. I used to never be afraid. I used to be somebody. I used to have something inside. Now it‚Äôs just this hole that‚Äôs open wide.‚Äù I guess Trent Reznor saw it coming all along.
I have learned what it is to feel like a pariah. To learn who my real friends are. To weigh every social interaction carefully‚Äîcan I risk admitting I need help? Or will that permanently stain their image of me if they‚Äôre in a position to recommend me somewhere?
Social media? A double-edged sword. I want to ask for help, but I don‚Äôt want to seem weak, desperate. I don‚Äôt want to spill the humiliating details where a potential employer could see them.
I want to be generous, but I can‚Äôt justify it. I want to spoil my family, but I feel like they deserve better than what I am now.
I‚Äôm haunted by that line: The road to hell is paved with hope and expectations. Because I had them. I had hope. I worked hard. I did everything I was supposed to. Got the education. Built the skills. Fought to be a good provider. Believed that effort, honesty, integrity, and hard work would pay off.
Now, I am an unemployed, middle-aged white man‚Äîthe least valuable demographic in corporate America. No one wants to hire me. No one even wants to talk about hiring me. How does one re-value themselves when everything they valued is found to be worthless?
I think about animals that wander away to die alone. That feels right. That feels familiar.
I don‚Äôt know how this started. But I can see exactly how it ends.
I used to believe I could see the future because I had goals. Plans. Now I see the future because it‚Äôs the same thing, over and over, every day exactly the same.
This is hell. I died five years ago. And this is the punishment:
Lose your job.
Lose your self-worth.
Lose your things.
Lose your roof.
Lose your family.
Lose your mind.
Lose your life.
But then there‚Äôs this other voice in my head.
I remember a quote‚ÄîEckhart saw hell too. He said:
The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won‚Äôt let go of life, your memories, your attachments. They burn them all away. But they‚Äôre not punishing you. They‚Äôre freeing your soul. So, if you‚Äôre frightened of dying and‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôre holding on, you‚Äôll see devils tearing your life away. But if you‚Äôve made your peace, then the devils are really angels, freeing you from the earth.
I think about that a lot. Maybe the torture here is my refusal to let go. My ego that still wants to be someone. Still wants approval, achievement, security.
‚ÄúIt is only after you have lost everything that you are free to do anything.‚Äù I guess Tyler Durden was on to something. 
What if I just accepted my situation and moved on? Changed the goals. Moved the finish line. Let go and declared myself a success anyway. Can one even do that at 54? I‚Äôm not even allowed access to my own retirement without penalty for another decade.
I‚Äôm trying.
Last year I got a tattoo on the inside of my forearm, a message to myself I see every day. It‚Äôs an ancient Jewish prayer known as Hana‚Äôs prayer‚Äîeven though I‚Äôm not Jewish, and I‚Äôm an atheist. But the words spoke to me:
‚ÄúLet me not die while I am still alive.‚Äù
It‚Äôs my reminder. My pact with myself. To resist the easy slide into depression and anxiety. To stay present. To engage with the world. To refuse to withdraw completely into solitude and isolation‚Äîbecause I‚Äôm not yet dead. 
The message still matters. It‚Äôs powerful. Most days it can pull me back from the darkness. Not always. But enough.
Because maybe this is hell. Or maybe this is life.
Either way, I‚Äôm still here.

I take 30mg (10 3x/day) Adderall and get more than 8 hours of sleep. I still drink occasionally but still struggle with this when I‚Äôm sober for weeks or even months. I avoid carbs when possible and have a mostly protein diet. 

Despite all of the above, not a day goes by that I‚Äôm sleepy to the point where I either stare at my todo list or give up and lay down on the couch (thank goodness I WFH). 

This issue is killing my productivity. I cannot time block or get through tasks without tripling down on stimulants (meds + coffee or energy drinks) ‚Äî which I‚Äôd rather not do. On rare occasions, I‚Äôll be alert for an entire day but there‚Äôs nothing I can discern that I‚Äôm doing differently. ",12,1751396005.0,ADHD,10,1.0,False

1lpa1ly,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/1lpa1ly/tomtmovie2010s_american_movie_where_white_woman/,"[TOMT][Movie][2010s] American movie where white woman kills Black woman in kitchen, takes her child","I‚Äôm trying to identify an American movie from around 2010 or later (definitely more modern than the 1990s). The specific scene I remember is quite disturbing:

**The scene:** A Black woman is cooking something in a pan in her kitchen at home. A white woman comes to visit. The Black woman offers to make coffee for them, but instead the white woman shoots (or hits with knife, not sure) and kills her. Later, the Black woman‚Äôs child comes home from school and discovers their mother dead in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor. The white woman apparently takes the child with her.

**Additional details:**

\- American film

\- Modern (2010s era, possibly later)

\- The kitchen/cooking scene is very specific - she was using a pan

\- The child coming home from school and finding the body is a key scene

\- Deals with racial themes and violence

\- The white woman taking the child suggests kidnapping/abduction plot

I'm struggling, its so hard to meet people and make friends in my 30s 

My best friend passed away a few years ago. My small little group of friends dissipated right after. people moved away, some of them grew away. My whole immediate family moved away. I don't have anyone I'm close to anymore. 

I miss coffee meetups and invitations to barbecues in the backyard. I miss ugly laughing together at funny stories catching up after a few weeks or months. I miss having friends. 

I have a son who just finished high school. Still living at home. I have a bf he lives in Ramona. I'm an assistant manager at a storage facility in town. I'm not really big on hikes and outdoor activities. I have a history of skin cancer and I'm a skin cancer survivor. I love crafting and having a couple seltzers. I have a pretty deep knowledge of weird and dumb movies. I like all kinds of music. I don't like to pigeonhole myself into some singular genres. I'm an alternative white girl. I want more tattoos and piercings and I'm sad I can't dye my hair green because of work. I absolutely love bowling. I am not very good at it. When I get to know you I will send you questionable memes and reels. I'm centrist in almost everything. I'm shy and have a hard time getting out of the house sometimes. I need a nudge from friends to have a reason to get out and do things. 

I already got my tickets to the thuggish ruggish tour. I'm trying to convince my boyfriend it to go in the middle of the week to see George thorogood. I love life music and don't often get to splurge on bigger things like those. There's midget wrestling in Ramona coming in August. If you are planning to go to any of these things, maybe we can meet there and have a drink! Send me your Instagram@ or dm here. I draw the line at anything harder than recreational weed coke and whippits I guess idk. Just don't want to bring hard drugs users into my life but I understand people party and wanna have a good time responsibility. ",23,1751395887.0,northcounty,6,0.87,False

1lp9yet,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1lp9yet/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_boyfriend_for_not/,AITA for getting mad at my boyfriend for not planning any dates?,"So my boyfriend, (29) and I (31 female) have been together almost 3 years. I am constantly planning cute dates for us and spending hundreds of dollars on food, gas, movies, hookah, dinners etc. Even just casual nights out for fast food and hookah, he will offer to pay once in a blue moon. Like it physically shocks me when he offers to pay for something without me asking. 

Recently we got into an argument about how I feel like he isnt putting in effort anymore. That the last real date he took me on was December 13, 2022. Where he planned it, kept it a surprise, and drove and paid. It was only a coffee date and then going to see Christmas lights but still it was effort and it was cute and I appreciated the thought. And at that time he was going through a transition between jobs so I understood money was tight for him at that moment. 

Now 3 years in to our relationship, he hasn't taken me on a real date once where he planned it, drove his own car or paid without asking me to cover anything with my own money. And everytime I try to ask him why, he resorts to saying 'I dont have money like that babe, you know that', but i watch him have money to see his favorite bands, to buy merchandise at shows, to buy himself lunch at work, to buy plane tickets to go to Texas, etc. 

For my birthday he didnt even get me a gift, he took me to get Chinese food and then to the beach. At night. While it was raining. And this was after he said he had been working overtime to surprise me for my birthday. But the big surprise was getting chinese food like we always do and sitting at the beach at night. But he was supposedly working overtime to save up for something big for my birthday? And then 2 days later his cousin was in town and I shit you not, he and I went to the store and he spent $150 on steaks, potatoes, chips and salsa, and desserts for him, his cousin and me. And when he was picking steaks he grabbed the last two ribeyes for himself and his cousin and he looked at me and goes 'these are the last two ribeyes, So you go ahead and pick a steak for yourself' and it was all thin cut steaks and super small cuts left over.

 And I try to tell him it makes me feel like im not worth it to him to take me out on a date the way I do for him frequently and he will say one of the following:

1. ""Oh I didnt know we were keeping score'
2. ""Oh, well I paid for x,y or z a few weeks ago so i guess that means nothing""
3. ""So I have to take you on expensive dates for you to be happy?'

And I try to tell him its not about the amount of money you spend, its about putting in the effort to show that you care and that you want to spend that time with me. And that its hard for me to NOT bring up dollar amounts  when you comstantly tell me that you dont have money to take me out but then i have to watch you spend hundreds of dollars on other people with no hesitation. But in the end I am always the one having to apologize for bringing up the topic because he wants to mope and make it seem like I am just wanting him to take me on luxurious dates. But thats not it at all! Like damn, take me to a dinner and a movie every now and again without saying something like 'oh ill get dinner if you'll get the tickets' when it was his idea to go out in the first place! 

This is a guy who didnt do anything for our first anniversary, forgot valentines day two years in a row, forgot our anniversary last year. Has not gotten me a single birthday present except for a card and candy. I am just at my wits 
End and I dont know what to do! And im tired of being made to feel like i am the AH. So you tell me, AITAH?

TLDR: My boyfriend makes me feel bad whenever I bring up the fact that he doesn't take me kn dates because he says he has no money but at the same time he will spend money on himself or others by the hundreds. AITAH for being upset?",1,1751395801.0,AITAH,10,1.0,False

Genre: 2D horror/exploration

Year of release: Not too sure, probably not earlier than 2018

Graphics: very dark really hard to see without brightness all the way up, main character and monsters were essentially just shadow form. When monsters died they kind of just melted away. Set in like a research lab/outpost where it was snowy out (not sure if winter or the arctic).

Notable characters: there is really only the player character, but as you progress you discover notes and computer entries from a doctor doing experiments.

Gameplay mechanics: part side scrolling, part able to walk up/down and climb. Keyboard/mouse usage.

Other details: I remember the first part of the game was trying to get in to the station itself, and having to go to a shed to grab the key. There are multiple areas to the game including areas accessed by elevators and by going outside, though the game primarily take place inside. I do remember very clearly that there were a couple barrack like rooms. There was one point where you had to interact with a coffee dispenser to get an item.

>A mysterious murder. A missing maid. A hidden affair. A will. And a surprise return.  
*Brazenville has secrets. And they‚Äôre no longer buried.*  
*(\~15 minute read, ends on a cliffhanger)*

\*\*\*

‚Äú*Another death at Osborne Manor,‚Äù* read the headline in *The Brazenville Post. ‚ÄúLily Osborne, the last surviving member of the Osborne family, was found hanging from a ceiling fan in her bedroom yesterday morning. Sources suggest it may have been staged, but the official report is yet to come. Chief Investigator James Merryweather declined to comment further.*‚Äù

George tossed the paper toward Rick. ‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù

Rick sipped his coffee. ‚ÄúToo early to say.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe need something soon. The agency‚Äôs barely afloat.‚Äù

Rick nodded slowly. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more to this one, though.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean the Michael Osborne murder?‚Äù

‚ÄúPossibly.‚Äù

George raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúSo, we‚Äôre taking the case?‚Äù

‚ÄúJames called himself. I figure it‚Äôs a good chance. Plus, you two can have a reunion,‚Äù Rick teased gently.

George shot Rick a glare. ‚ÄúHe could‚Äôve told us before joining the police. But‚Ä¶fine. When do we leave?‚Äù

‚ÄúThirty minutes.‚Äù

\---

At half past eleven, the two arrived at Osborne Manor, which sat on the outskirts of Brazenville beneath a heavy sky. Despite the morning mist lifting, the place retained a strange gloom. It seemed to have some dark secrets buried in it, waiting for someone to set them free.

James greeted them at the door. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt expect you‚Äôd actually come.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least someone still understands friendship,‚Äù George said dryly.

‚ÄúI deserve that,‚Äù James admitted, looking down. ‚ÄúI hope to make it up once we figure this out.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll talk later,‚Äù Rick interjected gently. ‚ÄúCatch us up on the details.‚Äù

James straightened slightly. ‚ÄúLily Osborne‚Äôs body was discovered by Mrs Turner, the part-time housekeeper who started working after the previous maid, Emma Vale, *disappeared*.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd Emma Vale disappeared‚Ä¶when exactly?‚Äù Rick asked.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not sure exactly, sometime shortly after Henry Thorne, the gardener was arrested for Michael Osborne‚Äôs murder.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, go ahead‚Äù

‚ÄúMrs Turner, panicked after seeing the body, immediately called the police.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid she touch anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe claims she didn‚Äôt touch a thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs she available for interrogation?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes‚Äù

‚ÄúFine then, we‚Äôll begin with her.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, let‚Äôs move into the house, the clouds are looming over, seems like it‚Äôll rain soon.‚Äù

The three men entered the Manor. The doors creaked as they opened. The interior was even gloomier, and felt heavy. There was a huge hall right at the entrance, with several small passages leading to different rooms. To the right of the hall stood the guest room, directly opposite one of the servant‚Äôs quarters. Beside the main bedroom, there were stairs leading up to the first floor having two smaller rooms, which were unoccupied.¬†

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in the guest room,‚Äù James said, lowering his voice. ‚ÄúHasn‚Äôt spoken much since the body was taken away. ‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not keep her waiting, then.‚Äù Rick replied.

In the dim light of the guest room, a middle aged woman sat on the edge of the recliner. Her hands were pale, and face was white, like the one which has been through shock recently. Upon seeing the men, she rose gently.

‚ÄúPlease keep sitting, Mrs Turner. ‚Äù James said politely. ‚ÄúThese are Rick and George, and they are investigating the case privately. If you would be kind enough to answer the questions they have regarding the case, it would help us move forward with the investigation.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, yes‚Ä¶ Ofcourse, ‚Äù she said, with a shivering voice.

‚ÄúPlease relax, Mrs Turner. We won‚Äôt keep you long. I first request you to tell me your full name,‚Äù said Rick.

‚ÄúAlice Turner‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long have you been working here?‚Äù

‚ÄúThree months.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you ever meet Emma Vale, the previous housekeeper?‚Äù

Mrs. Turner shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, she had disappeared by the time I joined. But her name was still on a couple of old pantry labels and linen records. I once saw her signature in an old register the day I joined. I think it was the attendance book. James said to ignore it, that it was outdated.‚Äù

George frowned. ‚ÄúAn attendance book?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, the staff used to log in hours worked, back when there were more people here. I believe they stopped updating it soon after Emma disappeared and Thorne got arrested.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you know that Emma stayed back in the servant's quarters? Did Lily have similar provisions arranged¬† for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn't know about Emma. But I was told about the servant's rooms and was given an option to stay there. I declined‚Äù

‚ÄúAny particular reason?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn't feel‚Ä¶ comfortable staying in the house at night‚Äù¬†

Rick noted this carefully. ""What exactly was your work, here at the Manor?‚Äù

‚ÄúUsual household, cooking, cleaning, washing dishes, and laundry. Occasionally, when Mrs Osborne wasn‚Äôt well, I was told to look after Mia, until‚Ä¶‚Äù a grim sorrow loomed over her face.

‚ÄúUntil what?‚Äù

‚ÄúUntil last month, when Mia, her six month old infant died of pneumonia. She was delivered prematurely, soon after Michael died and Lily went into depression.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did Mrs Osborne cope with the loss? Was she on medications?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe used to have sessions with her therapist, who had prescribed some drugs to deal with it. But after Mia‚Äôs death, her depression worsened, and she stopped having her sessions altogether. Last week, she had a panic attack while trying to sleep. I called the family doctor, and he made some changes in her medications.‚Äù

Rick and George exchanged a quick glance, then turned back to Mrs Turner. ‚ÄúDuring your work, did you ever see or find anything that seemed out of place or unusual?‚Äù

Turner‚Äôs eyes narrowed, and after giving Rick a thoughtful gaze, she took out a silver locket out of her pocket. ‚ÄúI found this in the servants‚Äô quarters. Lily told me to keep it until someone claimed it.‚Äù

Rick examined it closely, noting the engraved initials ‚Äú*H&E.*‚Äù He handed it to James. ‚ÄúMind if we keep this?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease do.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow Mrs Turner, could you please narrate the events of yesterday morning?‚Äù

‚ÄúI came at nine as usual. Lily didn‚Äôt respond when I knocked, so I assumed she was sleeping. I began my chores. Later, when she still didn‚Äôt answer, I opened the door. It wasn‚Äôt locked from inside. And‚Ä¶ there she was.‚Äù Her voice trembled, and tears gathered. ‚ÄúHanging.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnything strange happened afterward?‚Äù George gently prompted.

Turner paused thoughtfully. ‚ÄúActually‚Ä¶I saw *two masked men on a motorbike pass by*. It felt odd, but I didn‚Äôt mention it to the police, I was still in shock.‚Äù

Rick nodded. ‚ÄúThank you, Mrs. Turner. You've been very helpful.‚Äù

‚ÄúGlad to help. Can I leave for now?‚Äù

Rick gave a polite nod, and Mrs Turner quietly stood up. She went out of the guest room, and soon a soft creak was heard at the front door. The room went silent again. Rick glanced out of the window. The sky was growing darker, and the wind outside had picked up slightly, making the curtain shift.

\---

‚ÄúLooks like it‚Äôs going to rain,‚Äù George said, looking out too. ‚ÄúAs if this place wasn‚Äôt gloomy enough already.‚Äù

Rick was thinking. Then, turning to James, he asked, ‚ÄúMrs Turner mentioned something like an attendance register. Do you have that with you?‚Äù

James reached into the folder tucked under his arm and pulled out a worn-out brown register. ‚ÄúYeah, I brought it in with me. But it‚Äôs outdated and hasn't been updated since Emma went missing.‚Äù He handed it over.

Rick opened it, and quickly went through the pages. His eyes paused for a second. ‚ÄúHmm. Just wanted to confirm,‚Äù he said, closing it again and resting it on the table beside him.

‚ÄúSo, what next?‚Äù George asked.¬†

‚ÄúHenry Thorne,‚Äù James said. ‚ÄúHe was here on the night of the infamous Michael Osborne murder, arrested with no solid evidence. We should interrogate him next, since he's the only witness remaining from that night, after Emma went missing. I‚Äôve arranged a temporary release for questioning. He should be here soon.‚Äù

A moment later, the main door opened. A uniformed officer entered, followed by a stout middle-aged man, with his wrists still in cuffs. He looked tired and unshaven.‚Äù¬†

James offered a chair to the man. ‚ÄúHave a seat, Mr Thorne‚Äù, he said.¬†

Thorne sat down stiffly, not saying a word. His eyes briefly flicked between the three men before resting on the floor.¬†

Rick leaned forward. ‚ÄúGood afternoon, Mr. Thorne. Thanks for being here. I‚Äôm Rick, and this is my colleague, George. We‚Äôre private detectives, investigating the case after the tragic death of Mrs Osborne. ‚Äù

Thorne looked at them, unfazed. After a brief pause, he spoke, ‚ÄúAnd, what do you want from me?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here to talk about the night of Michael Osborne‚Äôs murder. We believe it might be connected to what happened to Lily. ‚Äú

‚ÄúI‚Äôve already told the police everything,‚Äù Thorne muttered. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt stop them from locking me away.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI understand. But sometimes the police miss what‚Äôs hidden between the lines,‚Äù Rick said calmly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not here to trap you. We‚Äôre here to listen, properly.‚Äù

Thorne‚Äôs lips tightened. ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt find anything new.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start simple,‚Äù said George. ‚ÄúYour name, and how long have you worked at the Osborne Manor?‚Äù

‚ÄúHenry Thorne. Thirty years. I was hired by Michael‚Äôs father, William Osborne. Been here since Michael was a child.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou must‚Äôve been close to the family, then.‚Äù Rick said.

Thorne shrugged. ‚ÄúI was just the gardener. Trusted, sure. But still staff.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what were you doing at the Manor at 3:30 a.m. the night Michael Osborne was murdered?‚ÄùA pause.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell you that.‚Äù

‚ÄúStill, you were there that night. You had a reason. A personal one. Someone you cared about.‚Äù

Thorne went pale and silent, his breathing became heavy.

‚ÄúEmma wasn‚Äôt just a colleague, was she?‚Äù

George and James shared a confused glance, then turned back to Rick. Thorne looked away, his jaws tightened. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about‚Äù, he said.

‚ÄúYou do recognize this locket, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù Rick showed him the silver locket taking it from James.

Thorne froze. He stared at the locket like he was looking through time. ‚ÄúWhere did you find this?‚Äù he asked, voice low and unsteady.

‚ÄúWhere it was found doesn‚Äôt matter, Mr Thorne. What matters is where is Emma? The one to whom this belonged?‚Äù

A flush appeared over Thorne‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúI loved her‚Äù, he whispered.

‚ÄúThen please let us help her.‚Äù Rick said.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt, she‚Äôs dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow can you be so sure?‚Äù

Thorne hesitated, his eyes drifting towards the window. ‚ÄúA couple of days after I was taken in,‚Äù he began slowly, ‚ÄúI asked one of the officers about her. He told me she‚Äôd been released on Mrs Osborne‚Äôs request. Said she was doing fine and still working at the Manor.‚Äù¬†

Rick nodded.¬†

‚ÄúI started requesting updates, asked to see her, even write to her. Every time, they brushed it aside. Said they‚Äôd pass on the message. No reply ever came.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd then?‚Äù George asked.

‚ÄúAbout a week after that, I woke up one morning to find a piece of paper pushed under my cell door. No envelope. No name. It said: *‚ÄòEmma‚Äôs been dealt with. You can stop looking.‚Äô*‚Äù

Thorne handed over the note to Rick, and the three men observed it carefully.

‚ÄúTell us what happened that night, Henry,‚Äù Rick urged gently.

Thorne took a breath. ‚ÄúWe were together in the servant‚Äôs quarters that night. Me and Emma.‚Äù

Rick straightened slightly. ‚ÄúTogether, as in‚Ä¶?‚Äù

Thorne didn‚Äôt look up. ‚ÄúYes. We were in a relationship. Kept it quiet.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe stayed in the servant‚Äôs quarters,‚Äù Thorne continued, his voice distant. ‚ÄúI used to come by after midnight, when the household was asleep. That night was no different, until we heard the scream.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho screamed?‚Äù Rick asked.

‚ÄúLily,‚Äù he replied, now leaning forward slightly. ‚ÄúIt was sudden. Sharp. We rushed to the bedroom, only to find her lying on the bed, unconscious, with a small, needle-like mark on her neck.

‚ÄúAnd you didn‚Äôt see Michael anywhere in the house?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I went looking. Emma stayed back with Lily, trying to wake her. I ran outside‚Ä¶ through the kitchen door to the lawn. That‚Äôs when I saw them.‚Äù

‚ÄúThem?‚Äù

‚Äú*Two men. Masked*. Running through the trees at the edge of the garden. I chased for a bit, but I‚Äôm not fast anymore. Lost them.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAnd then?‚Äù Rick asked quietly.

‚ÄúI came back. Emma was still with Lily, who had just begun to stir. We called the police. They soon found his body in the woods. He‚Äôd been stabbed multiple times, on the neck. There was a note in his pocket.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did it say?‚Äù

‚Äú*Justice is served.* Written in red ink. Or maybe blood, I couldn‚Äôt tell.‚Äù

After a brief moment of silence, Rick continued, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt the police pursue the masked men?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere was no trace left. No footprints, no tyre marks. Nothing usable. And I‚Ä¶ well, I was the only person without an alibi.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAnd Emma?‚Äù Rick‚Äôs voice softened.

‚ÄúShe was questioned and released. She continued to work at the Manor for a while.‚Äù

Rick studied him for a moment, then said gently, ‚ÄúMr Thorne‚Ä¶ could you please describe Emma, and your relationship with her?‚Äù

Thorne finally looked up. His eyes glistened. ‚ÄúEmma was the most beautiful woman I‚Äôd ever known.‚Äù¬†

There was a stillness in his voice.

‚ÄúShe had this‚Ä¶ light in her. A kind heart. A quiet grace. But her life - it wasn‚Äôt kind to her.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHer husband, Derek Blackwell, was a drunkard. Violent. I met her before she ever worked here. She used to come buy seeds from the gardening store I worked part-time at. One day, she came with a swollen lip. That was the first time we actually talked.‚Äù

Rick didn‚Äôt interrupt.¬†

‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt say anything at first, but over time‚Ä¶ she trusted me. Confided in me. Told me everything about Derek. I told her she needed to get out of it, but she was scared.‚Äù¬†

George nodded slowly. ‚ÄúAnd then she got the job at the Manor?‚Äù

Thorne nodded. ‚ÄúYes. She requested a placement for Derek too. Said if he had work, maybe he‚Äôd stop drinking. She believed in second chances, even for him.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened after that?‚Äù

‚ÄúOne day, Lily noticed a bruise on Emma‚Äôs arm while she was folding linen. Asked about it. Emma broke down. Lily was furious. Derek was fired immediately. Emma filed for divorce soon after.‚Äù

Rick frowned. ‚ÄúAnd no one knew about you and her?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. We kept it hidden. Lily might‚Äôve suspected something later, but never asked. We met quietly, when the house was asleep. My lodge was just a few blocks away. Easy to slip in.‚Äù

He looked down at his cuffed wrists.

‚ÄúAnd then came that night.‚Äù

Rick sat back slightly, digesting Thorne‚Äôs words. The room had fallen silent.

A sharp knock at the front door broke the silence.¬†

James stood. ‚ÄúThat must be the police van.‚Äù

The three men rose with Thorne. Rick extended his hand, and after a brief hesitation, Thorne took it.

‚ÄúI assure you Mr. Thorne, we‚Äôll find the truth.‚Äù Said Rick.¬†

Thorne nodded, emotion flickering behind his tired eyes. James guided him out. The front door creaked again, and moments later, they heard the sound of the van starting outside.¬†

Rick and George remained still in the guest room. James joined them after a brief pause.

\---

Finally, George spoke, turning towards Rick, ‚ÄúWould you care to explain?‚Äù

‚ÄúExplain what?‚Äù Rick asked

‚ÄúSurely you didn‚Äôt just guess about Henry and Emma? The locket could‚Äôve belonged to anyone.‚Äù

‚Äú*Sometimes, what we overlook ends up being the most telling.*‚Äù, Rick said, looking at James.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat register Mrs Turner mentioned‚Ä¶ it had both Emma and Henry‚Äôs names signed in, side by side, almost every single day. Too regular. Too consistent. Then, there‚Äôs the locket which was found in the servant‚Äôs quarters where Emma lived. Not something she‚Äôd leave lying around if it were meaningless.‚Äù

George nodded slowly. ‚ÄúSo you assumed‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI suspected,‚Äù Rick corrected. ‚ÄúThe night of the murder, Henry was caught inside the Manor at a strange hour, yet has always refused to say why. It all started adding up. I took a shot.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said James, ‚Äúthat shot worked. We‚Äôve got a whole new thread to follow now.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs follow it, then.‚Äù

James gave a small nod. ‚ÄúRight. The master bedroom, where Lily‚Äôs body was found. We‚Äôve kept it untouched, aside from removing the body for postmortem.‚Äù

Rick‚Äôs tone grew sharper. ‚ÄúHas the report confirmed it was suicide?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot yet. We‚Äôll have it by this evening.‚Äù

Rick exchanged a glance with George. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not waste time.‚Äù

The three men stepped into the hall, their footsteps dull against the aged wooden floor. They followed a narrow, curved passage that opened into a grand master bedroom. Despite the light outside, the room was dim, with heavy curtains drawn across the windows, casting a filtered gloom.

The room bore a quiet chaos. A king-sized bed sat in the center, flanked by two tall wooden cupboards and matching side tables. One side table had a cracked mirror and a lamp; the other was bare. The ceiling fan above hung low, and the light fixtures attached to it had all been wrenched out and lay shattered in a corner.

James stepped forward. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made sure not to disturb anything. The body was hanging from that fan when Mrs Turner found her.‚Äù

George gestured to the cupboards. ‚ÄúWhich one belonged to Mrs Osborne?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe one on the left,‚Äù James replied.

Rick nodded. ‚ÄúAlright. Let‚Äôs go through both wardrobes, and then check the side tables.‚Äù

They began their search. Lily‚Äôs cupboard was neat, her dresses folded in drawers, blouses arranged in tidy rows, and her formal wear hung crisply on hangers.

All seemed ordinary until George paused.

At the very bottom of the cupboard, tucked beneath a winter shawl, was a thin piece of paper. Partially singed at one corner.

‚ÄúRick,‚Äù George said quietly, retrieving it carefully. ‚ÄúHave a look at this.‚Äù

Rick leaned over. The paper was scorched on one side, but the handwriting was legible ‚Äî elegant, deliberate. And unmistakably personal.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a will,‚Äù George said. ‚ÄúAnd someone tried to burn it.‚Äù

Rick dusted the remaining ash off the edges of the will and squinted at the text, reading aloud:

‚Äú.*..I, Lily Osborne, being of sound and deliberate mind, declare this to be my final will. I leave the entirety of my estate, including the Osborne Manor, liquid assets, and personal effects, to Miss Emma Vale.*‚Äù

Silence.¬†

George blinked. ‚Äú*Emma Vale?*‚Äù

James looked confused. ‚ÄúThat must be old. Or a mistake.‚Äù

Rick slowly shook his head. ‚Äú*It‚Äôs dated last week.*‚Äù

The three men exchanged glances, the gravity of the moment settling in.¬†

‚ÄúShe never believed Emma was dead,‚Äù Rick murmured. ‚ÄúWas she protecting her?‚Äù

Before anyone could respond, the sharp creak of the front door echoed through the hall, louder this time.

**Footsteps.**

Then a figure appeared in the bedroom doorway - *soaked from the rain, her coat clinging to her, hair damp, eyes wide and uncertain.*¬†

>‚Äú*I‚Äôm sorry for interrupting,*‚Äù she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

>‚Äú*I‚Äôm Emma Vale.*‚Äù¬†

No one moved.¬†

Rick took a slow step back. George‚Äôs jaw stiffened.¬†

James looked as if he‚Äôd seen a ghost.¬†

Emma‚Äôs eyes moved to the document still held in Rick‚Äôs hand.¬†

>‚Äú*And I think you‚Äôve found something that belongs to me.*‚Äù

This does not feel like hypnagogic hallucinations‚Ä¶ While in a deep sleep, I heard my husband ask me if I wanted to sit outside with him. It woke me up but I hadn‚Äôt opened my eyes yet and I said ‚Äúyes‚Äù out-loud. He didn‚Äôt say anything back which is what caused me to open my eyes and when I did, he was not there. It didn‚Äôt feel like a dream bc his voice sounded like it was outside of my head and I heard him loud enough to wake me up to the point of consciously responding. So I called for him, he walked over to me and I asked him ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt you ask me to go outside with you?‚Äù And he said ‚Äúno but that‚Äôs weird you say that because I was just thinking about asking you that when I walked past you. But I didn‚Äôt say anything because I wanted to make you coffee first before I woke you up.‚Äù He never said anything out loud but I heard his thought.

On another occasion a couple months ago, I had a ‚Äúdream‚Äù that my dog verbally asked me to take her outside because she had to poop really bad. (My 10 year old dog has never woken us up to take her outside in the middle of the night or early hours, she sleeps as long as we do). The moment I woke up and opened my eyes, it‚Äôs like she knew her message reached me and she came running to me with her usual cues that tell me she has to poop and she was acting very desperate to go outside fast and she immediately went the moment she touched grass (normally she circles around for 5-10 min before finally going).

I‚Äôm not sure what this is because it doesn‚Äôt feel like a hallucination but more of like I‚Äôm tuning into my husband‚Äôs and dog‚Äôs minds like I‚Äôm reading them in my sleep. Has this happened to anyone else? Does anyone know what this is called? Curious if this is something I can strengthen too‚Ä¶

I selected the Eureka Mignon zero 65 and the Bambino Plus.

I initially was keen on the Turin DF64.  I did shy away from that because of a few posts regarding the noise.  The pro's kept coming back as such a great grinder.  However, I read on a Veterans post about it, that he had to return his because the frequency that it ground beans at, did wonders to his tinnitus.  
Myself, being a vet, and suffering from tinnitus, I didn't want to take the chance.

Now, I did want JUST an espresso grinder, but after some reading, several people said they got better espresso grind than other types of grinds with this machine.  Since this is going to be mainly for espresso, I'll take that his on lesser grind quality for the rest.

I purchased everything from Whole Latte Love.  Their staff seemed knowledgeable and threw multiple options at me, never pushing the sale, but letting me make the choice.

I am M25, right now in biggest ""I don't know what to do with my life anymore"" phase. I just wanted to ask for some comments, help, tips since I feel so alone and I do not have people to talk about this.

I was born in small European country, which is not prosperous and has future bright for young people especially. I used to (or at least I thought) I had great parents and great sister. But unfortunately, while unpacking my childhood trauma, I realized that was not true.

I used to have great connection with my dad, until I was 10. After that, he started acting weird, he was always worrying. He started to argue with my mum a lot, since my mum could not accepted that he started acting that weird. While arguing, my father, sometimes, used to went to attic of house and started preparing a ha\*\*ging rope, saying that he is going to ki\*l himself. Few years later, he died while he was at work. (I was 15 at that time)

My mum is so controlling and ""trying-to-be-perfect"" person. Especially after my father's death, she started panicking about me, about my grades (I could not get anything less than A, everything around me has to be perfect, I could not have fun with my friends, I could not go out...). Every time when I made a mistake, she would get angry at me and giving me a silent treatment or I was punished (Even if I was 23, for example)

Since I have started working on my mental health a few years ago, I moved to another country pursuing my masters degree. I thought that moving out of the country, would help me, but unfortunately it is not helping so far. I moved to the smaller town, which is boring, I have absolutely no friends. (For me, it is hard to make friends, my therapist said it is because of relations with my mum). At the beginning, it was great, since I was looking for peace, but right now I can not take it anymore.

Also, I am a gay. I am trying to make a peace with that part of myself since 2018, and I am kinda proud of that part. But unfortunately, I am not proud of some parts:  
\- I have never been in a relationship. I know that I should not be focused on that much, but it sucks. I had been in love two times, but that love was not returned. Since that, I was trying to find another guys, but I keep rejecting them, or getting scared/annoyed when they propose a date, coffee or something like that

\- Because of this and my looks, I am now used to hook ups. And I hate it. I was trying to understand why I keep doing this and I think it is because of my lack of ""how to make friends"" skills, since I am scared to make first moves.

\- Also, I am tired of top/bottom preferences. I am not experienced in anal and I am scared to do it. But guys do not understand it.

I feel very silly to post this here but I think I need some advice, from gal to gal. 
There's a guy that works at a coffee shop near my work and I fancy him loads. For the first few weeks I thought he was into me too  so I kept going in to get coffees hoping to chat with him (very lame, very simp, I know). For context, I am on the spectrum and also a foreigner, both of which make understanding British people difficult at times so I wasn't sure if he was just being nice or if he was into me which is why I didn't take action for a long time. Now, I think I want to take the bull from its horns so to speak and ask him out but: a) I don't want to embarrass myself and have to find another coffee shop instead. b) I also dont want to put him in an uncomfortable position as after all I am still a customer and there's some sort of power dynamic there that I cannot ignore. c) being direct wouldn't work as apparently I lose my dignity everytime I speak to him as if this is my first crush.

Any tips from fellow introvert austics? Or anyone really. How do you ask someone out in a polite but direct manner, especially when you might have the social skills of a dead hamster when talking to cute/hot guys?

1lp9mbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TEFL/comments/1lp9mbk/which_would_you_choose/,Which would you choose?,"Hi guys. TLDR at the bottom.

I've got a bit of a life & career dilemma coming up at the end of my current contract, and I'd like to know your thoughts and what you would do. 

Current situation: Right now, I teach at a university in a smaller Chinese city.

The Pros: It's very very low workload, as in I teach 6-9 hours per week, and there is 0 lesson prep, 0 office hours and usually 0 meetings. This means that I get exactly 6-9 hours per week of work and outside that, I have complete freedom. 

My commute to work is about 5 minutes by bicycle, so I don't waste much time with that either. 

While the salary is low relative to some jobs (20400 RMB per month), I also get a housing allowance (7500 RMB twice per year), and they also pay for my flights twice per semester (at the beginning to arrive, and at the end to leave) to and from the destination of my choice. Usually, I fly back to Europe, where I'm from. With this salary I can usually save 15-16k RMB per month, so that's nice. 

By far the biggest pro is the holidays. I have about 6 weeks holidays during Chinese New Year, and roughly 3 months in summer. For example, this year I finished class on June 20th, and I'm not back in work til September 29th. I also have lots of other breaks like all the national holidays we might get throughout the semester. All of this time is still fully paid each month.  

However, it's not all peaches & cream. 

The Cons: I absolutely detest this city. While I speak pretty good Mandarin, I hate that there is absolutely no foreigner scene here. It's a small city, there seems to be no social life at all. I'm still young, I want to go out and meet people. I'm the youngest lecturer at the university, and all of the others have no interest in socializing. I don't just mean drinking or partying, I've offered hikes, lunch, coffee, and it's crickets. The city is so so boring, and looking online I find that everyone else says the same thing. The best part of being here is when I get to leave on the holidays and not think about it.  

The weather is also pretty bad. Being down south, it's super humid and hot. Also, it rains a lot. 

Basically the cons are that I feel like the city is a bad fit for me & what I want. 

The Decision: At the end of my contract, I'm considering 2 options. 

The first is moving up to Shanghai to work. There are multiple 40k RMB per month jobs posted that I believe I have the qualifications for. While obviously I would be working way more hours, that's true of literally probably almost any job. You might not think it, and I wouldn't have believed it until I spent the last 2 years working here, but working 6 hours a week in a city with nothing to do and few people to hangout with is pretty boring. Of course the grass is always greener, but I do think I'd be much happier in Shanghai, living a more balanced and fulfilled life in comparison to here, and also economically, with higher tax and higher rent costs, I don't think I would suffer much financially. It's hard to say, but I might even save more, as I'm a pretty frugal guy. I guess the only risk I can think of is I know my job is really easy and management is fair, and I could move to Shanghai and end up in some kinda nightmare school. There are other things I generally get annoyed at while living in the middle kingdom, like VPNs crashing etc, but I can deal with it. 

The second option is much more drastic and involves moving back to Europe to try get a job with the EU Commission. There's a bunch of jobs there I qualify for that are paid well, and obviously it's much more multicultural and there are plenty of foreigners everywhere. This would be a big career move. I've lived in multiple European countries before, and liked them all, probably for the reasons I said above. More than anywhere, I would love to live in Spain again, only somehow make much more money than I was making before. For the EU in general, the only hit I would take is probably to my savings at first, unless I got one of the competitive roles like the upcoming Generalist Administrator competition in August. It's also annoying to move country. I've moved country 5 times in the past 3 years. 

Anyway, my contract ends in March, and I don't know what to do. Whether I should just stay put, risk a move to Shanghai or a move back to Europe. What would you do?

TL:DR - Would you stay somewhere you dislike because your job is easy and you save good money, or would you move to somewhere you think would be better for you personally, even if you're taking on way more work / potentially worse work environment or potentially a whole new career?",3,1751395019.0,TEFL,1,0.72,False

*Most of my experience is with people I sought for help. The first medium said I killed her guardian angel.

*Anyway, I've lost my job and my apartment. Maybe we can help each other out.*

I upload an old profile photo from LinkedIn and hit post on my ad. Hopefully, Facebook Marketplace has at least a few shoppers looking for help clearing their homes. I start rubbing my burning eyes but something is moving on the right side of my screen.

The model in an ad thumbnail is eating her severed leg. I blink twice. The severed leg grows its own legs and leg arms. The image's intended effect is obvious. If it‚Äôs anything besides a life-destroying attention whore, it is creative. The image is arguably very scary. The leg is now doing things to the model that cause me vicarious embarrassment when I should be terrified. I‚Äôm just so tired.¬†

¬†People in the coffee shop are staring. I‚Äôm sure something has happened. Instinctively, I check myself for feelings of wetness and temperature change. Nothing. I smell the air. There‚Äôs only the smell of coffee and baked goods. A reflection off the coffee shop window temporarily blinds my eyes.

*There it is.*¬†

I force my eyes open. The glass is filled with prismatic rainbows of light. Back and forth they spin, enticingly beautiful in a way that makes you remember the lovely shiver a rainbow can still cause. The coffee shop patrons are leaving the chairs, stumbling forward toward the radiant glass.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù A bearded man wonders, nearly at the glass.

‚ÄúSTOP!‚Äù I gurgle. The terror has finally managed to overcome my exhaustion, so the words come out of my mouth like overcooked okra. ‚ÄúSCHMOOOOK‚Äù is what I hear. Nobody listens to me.¬†

The bearded man‚Äôs fingers touch the glass. A couple of ladies follow suit. Their fingers go from tentative touches to gentle caresses. Seconds go by and they are pushing on the glass like it's denying them entry to the most wonderful place they HAVE to go.¬†

Soon, everyone is heading toward the window except for me. I know this is not going anywhere good.¬†

I pull my voice out from between my breasts. I summon everything I can to be brave and help these people because I cannot handle any more guilt. I shouldn‚Äôt have come to a public place. I just really need free Wi-Fi right now. McDonalds has kids in it every hour of the day.¬†

I‚Äôm so brave right now, I tell myself. I‚Äôm like my warrior ancestor women, standing up to invaders while the men are away on raids.¬† I jump on the table and see the Bearded Guy‚Äôs hand go *through* the windows. Fucking prepositions. The glass breaks into vertical cracks. Its safety glass that won‚Äôt stay safe for long because now every person in the coffee shop is pushing against the glass. Blood trickles down the glass from a few patron‚Äôs hands. Red rivulets follow the cracks.

I decide to try a trick I‚Äôve been working on.¬†

*OOOOOOOOKLAHOMA‚Ä¶WHERE THE WIND COMES SWEEPING DOWN THE PLAIN!*¬†

My voice booms loud, louder than the crackles and pops of deforming glass. I can‚Äôt sing well but I can sing LOUD. I just need one of the fixated patrons to notice me.¬†¬†

*I WAS DEHYDRATED 'TIL THE BEAT VIBRATED*

*I WAS REVIVED AS SOON AS THIS BITCH GYRATED*

I rap at the top of my lungs. One of the women stops pushing¬† Maybe it‚Äôs working? I plumb the depths of my mind for the most distracting songs I can think of.¬†

*WHAT‚ÄôS UP GAGNAM STYLE!?!*

The Bearded Man pulls back bloody hands. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what he says,‚Äù he mumbles, hanging his head down and shaking his head like it's full of bees. ‚ÄúHoly SHIT!‚Äù He yells, suddenly noticing his bloody hands. ‚ÄúHOLY SHIT!‚Äù¬†

His outburst distracts the woman next to him. She screams and backs away from the window. The other patrons start doing the same, like waking up dominos. They stumble backwards and look around for whatever caused the situation.

Something warm and moist touches my arm, wrapping itself around my neck. It tightens *a lot*, but I can still breathe, just barely.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm paying attention to you,‚Äù I whisper between gritted teeth, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to survive.‚Äù In response, the warmth stretching across my chest gets A LOT hotter. I‚Äôm supposed to wonder how hot it will get. Soon, it will burn me hot enough to do just that.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck is going on?‚Äù The bearded guy asks the store manager. He shakes his head, too busy punching numbers in his phone.¬† This is my cue to leave. Maybe I won‚Äôt though because I might get burnt to death. I don‚Äôt think so though.¬† I‚Äôve never been hurt to the point where I can‚Äôt feel it anymore.¬†

‚ÄúCan we go?‚Äù I ask. I‚Äôm not asking for permission. I‚Äôm doing the annoyed thing you do with someone who should know when it's time to leave. I‚Äôm just talking to It like I would talk to an asshole, drunk boyfriend. I know it‚Äôs messed up.¬† Everything is messed up right now. You don‚Äôt notice a pile when it is also a swarm.

The heat calms. Sirens are approaching. I make my escape from the coffee shop quickly, not meeting any of the patrons‚Äô eyes. My car sits across the street, filled to the windows with my stuff. It‚Äôs my home away from homeless. I really don‚Äôt want to sleep in it again tonight. Last night, It kept starting the engine and putting the car in reverse. I need to sleep in something less mobile.

It‚Äôs time to face reality. There really is only one place left for me to go. I guess it's time to make this nightmare complete. The devilish entity that cannot exist without my attention is going back home with me to meet my narcissistic, attention-seeking mother.

Picture this: You've made the decision, you've got your prescription, and that little Zepbound pen is sitting there, promising a new chapter. It's exciting, a little nerve-wracking, and totally normal to wonder, ""What's actually going to happen now?"" I know that feeling well!

Starting a new medication, especially one like Zepbound, can feel like stepping into the unknown. You're probably curious about the side effects, how quickly it works, and just what your day-to-day might look like. Well, you're in the right place. I'm here to share what I've learned from my own journey and what you can generally expect during those crucial first few weeks on Zepbound. Think of this as a friendly chat over coffee, not a medical textbook.

**The Very First Dose: It's Simpler Than You Think**

Let's be honest, the idea of an injection can feel a bit daunting at first. Many people worry about pain or complicated steps. But here's the good news: it's designed to be incredibly user-friendly.

**The Injection Itself - A Gentle ""Click""**

* **Prep is minimal:** You just twist off the cap and place it against your skin - usually your stomach, thigh, or upper arm.
* **No visible needle:** The needle is tiny and hidden, so you don't even see it. This was a huge relief for me!
* **Two clicks:** You'll hear a first click when the injection starts, and a second click when it's done. It's quick, usually less than 10 seconds.
* **Virtually painless:** Most people, myself included, report little to no pain. It's often just a slight pressure or a tiny pinch, if anything.

**Immediate Post-Dose Feelings: Don't Expect a Lightning Bolt**

You won't feel a sudden rush or immediate change right after your first injection. That's totally normal. Zepbound works gradually, and its effects build up over time in your system.

* **No instant appetite change:** Your hunger cues won't vanish in an hour. Give it some time to start working its magic.
* **Mild or no initial side effects:** While some people might feel a little something hours later, many experience nothing noticeable on day one.

**Week 1-2: Navigating the Initial Changes**

This is often when you start to really notice Zepbound doing its thing. It's a period of adjustment, both for your body and your habits.

**Appetite Suppression Starts to Kick In**

This is usually the first major sign that the medication is working.

* **Food noise quiets down:** That constant chatter in your head about what to eat, when to eat, or what you're craving often becomes much quieter. It's a revelation for many!
* **Satiety comes sooner:** You'll likely feel full much faster than before, even after eating smaller portions.
* **Cravings diminish:** Those intense urges for certain foods, especially sugary or highly processed ones, tend to lessen significantly. This is actually pretty cool to experience.

**Managing Potential Side Effects - Be Prepared**

Not everyone experiences side effects, but it's good to be aware of the common ones, just in case. They tend to be most noticeable during the first few weeks, especially after your initial dose or when increasing your dose.

* **Nausea:** This is probably the most common side effect. It can range from mild queasiness to feeling genuinely unwell.
 * **Tips:** Eat smaller, more frequent meals. Avoid greasy or overly rich foods. Stay hydrated. Ginger chews or peppermint tea can help.
* **Fatigue:** You might feel more tired than usual. This often improves as your body adjusts.
 * **Tips:** Prioritize sleep. Listen to your body and rest when you need to.
* **Constipation or Diarrhea:** Some people experience changes in their bowel habits.
 * **Tips:** Increase fiber intake (slowly!). Drink plenty of water. Talk to your doctor about over-the-counter remedies if needed.

**Hydration and Nutrition - Your New Best Friends**

With reduced appetite, it's easy to forget to eat or drink enough. This is where active effort comes in.

* **Water, water, water:** Staying well-hydrated is crucial for managing side effects and general well-being. Carry a water bottle with you!
* **Nutrient-dense choices:** Focus on protein-rich foods, fruits, and vegetables. Even small portions should be packed with nutrients.
* **Listen to your body:** Don't force yourself to eat if you're not hungry, but do aim for balanced, smaller meals throughout the day.

**Week 3-4: Settling In and Seeing Progress**

By this point, many people start to feel more settled into their Zepbound routine. The initial side effects often diminish, and you might start to see more consistent results.

**Food Noise Quiets Down Even More**

This is often described as one of the most profound effects. The mental space freed up from constant food thoughts can be truly amazing. You might find yourself thinking about food only when you're actually hungry, not out of habit or emotional triggers.

**Beyond the Scale - Other Wins**

While weight loss is a primary goal, Zepbound often brings other benefits that are just as, if not more, impactful.

* **Increased energy (for some):** As your body adjusts and you're fueling it better, some people report feeling more energetic.
* **Improved relationship with food:** Many find they're making more mindful choices and no longer feel controlled by food.
* **Better blood sugar control:** This is a key benefit, especially for those with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes.

**Communication with Your Doctor is Key**

Your doctor is your partner in this journey. Don't hesitate to reach out.

* **Report side effects:** Even mild ones are worth mentioning. Your doctor might suggest strategies or adjust your dose.
* **Discuss progress:** Share what's working and what's challenging.
* **Ask questions:** No question is too small when it comes to your health.

**Common Questions & Tips for Success**

You might be wondering about a few specific things during this initial phase.

**What About Weight Loss?**

Everyone's journey is different, but generally, weight loss tends to be gradual.

* **Don't obsess over the scale daily:** Fluctuations are normal. Focus on weekly or bi-weekly weigh-ins.
* **It's not always linear:** You might see a good drop one week, then a plateau, then another drop. This is part of the process.
* **Focus on habits:** The medication helps, but incorporating healthy eating and movement habits will amplify your results.

**Listen to Your Body**

This is probably the most important piece of advice for your first few weeks, and beyond.

* **Eat when hungry, stop when full:** Zepbound helps with this, but consciously practicing it is powerful.
* **Don't push through severe side effects:** If something feels really off, contact your doctor.
* **Rest when you need to:** Your body is adjusting to a powerful medication.

**Wrapping Up Your First Weeks on Zepbound**

Your first few weeks on Zepbound are a time of discovery and adjustment. It's a journey, not a sprint, and every body reacts a little differently. You'll likely experience a significant reduction in appetite and food noise, and you might encounter some mild side effects that usually improve over time. The key is to stay hydrated, make nutritious choices, and keep an open line of communication with your healthcare provider.

You're taking a fantastic step towards better health, and remember, you're not alone in this! Be patient with yourself, celebrate the small victories, and trust the process.",1,1751394634.0,ZepboundWiki,0,1.0,False

I obviously don‚Äôt, never even tried them but for this week she has been on my neck a lot. A few days ago while we were laying down on my bed she told me to be careful and to not even trust the closest. I knew she was SA‚Äôd by her elementary teacher when she was little, but I always thought there was more to that. So that night I questioned her a lot and finally asked ‚ÄúDid anyone else SA you?‚Äù and she started bawling her eyes out. She told me that when I was around 3, (which is when her addiction started) my dad forced her to take multiple shit and forced her into a group sex. It happened multiple times when I was around that age and when we moved states it stopped. Also my stepdad put some relaxing pills in her coffee. I was shocked. My dad never did anything towards me. He was the most loving father and cherished me to bits. But I knew he was a shitty husband. Both to my mom and my stepmom. He used to hit them, cheat on them and bully them verbally. He never even layed a finger on me or yelled at me. My mom keeps telling me to not be angry at him, shes not anymore and that he‚Äôs still my father who did nothing wrong to me. But I can‚Äôt help but be so frustrated with him. I don‚Äôt want visit his grave but at the same time I want to go there and yell at him. I don‚Äôt want to stay at my grandparents because I know my grandma is going be really depressed and my grandpa will not leave me alone.

**1. Product Reviews** ‚Äì Sharing your honest thoughts and experiences using our products across various tools (fountain pens, markers, colored pencils, etc.).

**2. Lifestyle Content** ‚Äì Capturing our products in use at coffee shops, parks, your desk, school, or anywhere you feel inspired.

\- We started friendly chatting a few months ago and I enjoyed building a friendship  
\- I recently developed strong feelings for her  
\- Despite working in the same office we strictly were chatting, I once aplogized that I would never come over to chat directly and she would mention that we are like pen pals and that is nice as well, not everyone need to communicate face to face  
\- A few weeks back she went through a harder time becuase stuff that happened in her home country I simply reached out to ask how she is doing  
\- She suggested that we maybe could go out one day when times are better and if I am also interested

So last week we were joking around a bit and ended up deciding to plan to meet up for a coffee this week, now I didnt want to be pushy - the issue is that due to my feelings I am afraid of behaving in a wrong way making her feel uncomfortable, and I also am pretty sure she is only interested in a friendship - so didnt mention it anymore, I dont believe its happening this week. Now I was thinking of inviting her for next week to go out like she suggested (and actually following up with a plan). Just casually. We started reading a book together today and it would be nice to chat about it.

And maybe this worry sounds ridicolous, but should I ask her to go out together? I enjoy her friendship truly, but I am also right now interested in more, and I am sure that she is only interested in a friendship, and suddenly no matter my intentions for that meet up, it feels inappropiate to even meet up.

And here is the other thing that ironically causes me to feel even more insecure about it and more like I shouldnt: maybe the reason I believe that she only is interested in a friendship is that self destructive voice in my head and in reality, maybe she could also be at least somewhat interested in me. But that ironically makes it worse because suddenly I feel like I try to convince myself that she could like me in that way even though I know she doesnt making a meetup, no matter how casual, even more inappropiate.

# üó£Ô∏è LANGUAGE IN CURA√áAO

* The most spoken language is **Papiamentu**. It is also the native language of the island.
* **Dutch** is the main language for school, government, and legal paperwork.
* **English** is widely spoken, especially in tourism. The younger kids now want to speak only in English.
* **Spanish** is also common. Many have latin american ascendants and we grew up watching telenovelas.
* More and more people working in tourism are also learning **Portuguese.**

üó®Ô∏è Locals often switch between languages mid-sentence. It‚Äôs normal to hear 3 languages in one convo.

# üöó TRANSPORTATION: RENTALS & BUSES

# Car Rentals

* Recommended to rent a car as it gives you freedom to travel all around the island on your own.
* Most agencies have a *3-day minimum*. Many local rental companies can even pick you up at the airport or drop the car off where needed.
* For **1-day rentals**, try **Smart Wheels** (ideal for cruise visitors). [https://smartwheelscuracao.com/](https://smartwheelscuracao.com/)

# Public Transport

# üìç ACCOMMODATION ‚Äì HOTEL, AIRBNB OR VILLA?

A little about me: For starters, I'm an avid book reader. I'm especially fond of romance and psychological thrillers. I have a passion for writing‚ÄîI like to jot down little ideas, kinda like excerpts I've thought of, and I also like writing poems. I do photography as well, but I'm still an amateur at that.   
Personality-wise, I'm quite introverted. I have a difficult time pushing myself to interact with people. I'm not much of a socializer; however, I am down to talk to anyone who approaches me first. Once you get to know me, you'll realize that I'm a pretty outgoing and cheerful person, despite having social anxiety, and I become caring and affectionate to people I become close with.  A fun fact about me is that I LOVE coffee. I can drink it anywhere, anytime, iced, hot, with additives, or even just straight up black. (I take my caffeine seriously, y'all)  
I also LOVE music. Music is a huge part of my life. I can jam to any genre, and I'm always open to listening to new songs and getting introduced to new musicians/artists. Speaking of music, the LOML is dance. I have been performing for a little over a decade now‚Äî most of my performances consist of dancing and singing. Honestly, dance has given me the confidence and optimism to express myself. It helps me big time. I mostly do hip hop, commercial, and femme, but hoping to learn more styles soon. (I'm very interested in ballroom)  
  
Another interest of mine is fashion. I'm fond of clothes and shoes, and seeing them just gives me this unexplainable joy. If you're a person who also likes dressing up and aesthetics, I think that we'd get along well. (Also, if anyone knows where I can purchase cheap and good quality accessories and statement pieces, please do give me recommendations. Thank you<33)

Like, why are we trapped in cubicles sipping stale coffee when there‚Äôs a whole world out there of creativity and opportunities? Well, what's stopping you from *making bank* with the power of AI? üí∏

I know, I know. It sounds a bit like a ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù scheme, but hear me out! There‚Äôs a massive gold rush happening right now in the AI space, and if you're not grabbing a shovel, you might just miss out. So, how do we navigate this AI universe without ending up in the rabbit hole? *Let‚Äôs dive in!*

Here‚Äôs a snappy beginner‚Äôs guide to get you started on your creator journey:

**1. Find Your Niche** 
   - What are you passionate about? ü§î 
   - Are you a master of memes, a word wizard, or a video virtuoso? 
   - Dig deep and think: what sparks joy for you? 

**2. Leverage AI Tools** 
   - Don‚Äôt sweat it if you're not a tech guru. There are plethora of tools to help you. 
     - **Writing:** Try ChatGPT for blog ideas.
     - **Design:** Check out Canva's AI features to whip up graphics. 
     - **Video:** Use tools like Lumen5 to turn scripts into engaging videos. 

**3. Create, Create, Create** 
   - You don‚Äôt need to be perfect from day one. In fact, you might suck a little at first‚Äîembrace it! 
   - The more you create, the more you'll discover what works. 

**4. Engage Your Audience** 
   - Use social media to connect. People love authentic interaction! 
   - Share behind-the-scenes looks at your creative process. You'd be surprised how many people will root for you. 

**5. Monetize Smartly** 
   - Consider content creation platforms like Patreon or Ko-fi. 
   - Affiliate marketing is a goldmine if you have a niche audience. 
   - Selling digital products? E-books and online courses are hot commodities. 

And let‚Äôs not forget the best part: you can work from anywhere‚Äîthe couch, a cafe, or even your cousin‚Äôs cat's birthday party. üê±üéâ Who doesn‚Äôt want to mix work with fun?

But here's the kicker: the window is closing! üìâ AI is still fresh and rapidly evolving, but as more people jump on the bandwagon, competition will skyrocket. The time to act is NOW! 

Can you imagine looking back in a year and realizing you had the chance to be a creator while others were still stuck in their old routines? Yikes, right?

as you probably know my MIL blew UP on my husband and i about 2 1/2 weeks ago at a family dinner because we said we would not be sharing our baby name. literally that‚Äôs what caused the blow up, i cannot make this up. anyways, she stormed out crying and grabbed her 12 year old daughter and the 14 year old adopted kid she‚Äôs fostering and promptly left creating a very awkward and outright tension amidst the family. one i was expecting for quite some time. 

well when she left i blew the lid off on her behaviors (not even everything just a small snippet) to her mom and my husbands grandma was profusely apologetic and shocked by the behaviors her daughter exhibited to us that she was naive to. she‚Äôs unfortunately naive to A LOT. her daughter is a class-A narcissist to a T, and after this blow up my husband and i mutually agreed that her flagrant behavior needed to be checked and we wouldn‚Äôt let her weasel her way back in so easily.

the next day we both got an extensive paragraph in a group text to us two from his mom- where she really didn‚Äôt apologize and accused us of intentionally isolating only her. as i expected she twisted every single thing to be the victim. the entire reason we aren‚Äôt sharing names this second pregnancy is because of HER. she was so abhorrently rude when i named my daughter the name i chose because it was too similar to my own moms. she harassed us for three weeks with lists of suggestions, asked for her own name to be included, she really didn‚Äôt hold back it was repulsive. then she posted her full legal name and due date against my wishes once i said to stop with the suggestions. 

so when she asked what we would be naming this baby (we are doing surprise gender at the end and have a boy and girl name already chosen) i said we wouldn‚Äôt be announcing the name choices to ANYONE, and that‚Äôs when she blew up literally SCREAMING at us.

in the text she said ‚Äúapparently it‚Äôs disrespectful to ask your adult son what he‚Äôs thinking of naming his child‚Äù and ‚Äúdo you know how much that hurts to be told ‚Äúwe have thought of names, but we‚Äôve decided we won‚Äôt be sharing it ONLY with you‚Äù she‚Äôs such a dipshit manipulator she doesn‚Äôt realize i remember conversations word for word verbatim and even typed out the screaming match THAT DAY as a transcript in my phone to refer back to. she also claimed that she only blew up because my husband was disrespectful to her first (complete lie, such a little victim)

then she said ‚Äúyou guys also apparently think it‚Äôs damaging to your 1 1/2 year old to witness a 12 year old play on a phone which is ridiculous‚Äù her daughter is so non verbal i‚Äôll ask her how she‚Äôs doing and how‚Äôs school and she can‚Äôt answer. i have to essentially spoon feed her answers. (example last october my husbands 20 year old cousin and i were chatting next to her and asked about how choir was going. she said ‚Äúuhh‚Ä¶‚Äù and stared at my ceiling for ten seconds like her brain glitched out. the cousin looked at me confused and said ‚Äúum (name) did you just start choir this year?‚Äù and she goes ‚Äúuhhh, yeah‚Äù and looked back at her ipad dead panned) the girl is literally brain dead from the ipad dependency it‚Äôs downright abuse but the mom continues to downplay her shit parenting.

at the end of her text she said ‚Äúthe judgement comes from everyone not just you guys, and i am stepping away from family gatherings for a while, i don‚Äôt know how long, but this is all very traumatic for me and i need to step away.‚Äù 

whatever.

then two days later grandmas on the phone with husband and already confirms that his mom is going to 4th of july at the aunts house üòÇüòÇ as i expected SHES SO PREDICTABLE.
4th of july was cancelled by the aunt only days later because she knew drama would ensue and even admitted on the phone to me that MIL ruins camping trips, dinners, birthdays, etc and she didn‚Äôt want to deal with it on the 4th as she‚Äôs an OB doctor and is working a 24 hour shift the day after and didn‚Äôt want family drama to exhaust her (understandable) also there‚Äôs a family camping trip on the 6th 7th 8th and 9th and i‚Äôm expecting MIL to show up and ruin that as well.

well after about 4 days of no answer to her dramatic text, she sent an ESSAY to my husband on father‚Äôs day that was even more of an attack. she explained that the 14 year old foster kid she‚Äôs had since november of 2024 has been ‚Äúcrying so much‚Äù since our blow out and asked if he‚Äôd be sent back to a previous home where she said ‚Äúno honey.. they gave up on you‚Äù ü•¥ she made him believe that we don‚Äôt allow her to watch our 1 1/2 year old daughter because of HIM. not true whatsoever it‚Äôs that she‚Äôs a shit person/parent. this absolutely pissssssed my husband OFF. she‚Äôs dug herself into a deep trench and doesn‚Äôt realize it. he once again didn‚Äôt answer. 

about three days after that she sent him a text saying ‚Äúi apologized and i meant it. please forgive me for i am a human and i make mistakes. i am your mother. let‚Äôs meet for dinner or coffee soon and talk.‚Äù

once again radio silence from him lol. three days after that she texts him again at 11 am and says ‚Äúi miss you guys. hope everyone‚Äôs doing okay üò¢‚Äù still no answer üòÇ

THEN she stoops to texting me at 9 pm that night (im sorry this is so comical 9 pmüò≠üò≠ she‚Äôs so desperate) a whole paragraph about how she wished i wouldn‚Äôt have misinterpreted how she downplayed my near death birth trauma and made it about herself, how she‚Äôs ‚Äúalways liked me‚Äù and ‚Äúi won‚Äôt be coming to the camping trip so don‚Äôt worry about it being awkward, but i hope you two talk to me before that date‚Äù (we won‚Äôt) and then said ‚Äúi‚Äôve texted my son multiple times to apologize but he hasn‚Äôt replied‚Äù yeah stupid ass silence IS your answer.

still no response AGAIN. so this past sunday we went to husbands grandparents for dinner for the first time since the blow up. she was obviously not there, if her car was going to be parked outside we agreed we would have kept on driving. anyways we had a good dinner with them. the grandma tells me randomly while we‚Äôre alone that the foster kid went back to live (for a week) with the previous guy who ‚Äúgave up on him‚Äù because he ‚Äúmissed him‚Äù and ‚Äúhe had a great time!‚Äù weird- already she‚Äôs transitioning to give him up. also [important context!!] two weeks before her blow up she randomly ran into my dad at safeway and spilled the beans that ‚Äúthings aren‚Äôt working out with (foster kid)‚Äù and so this blow up became her scapegoat to give him back and put the blame on us. CRAZY RIGHT?!

at the very end of the dinner the grandma goes to my husband ‚Äúso what are you going to do about your mom?‚Äù and before he even gets a word out she jumps ahead and goes ‚ÄúSHE IS YOUR MOTHER!‚Äù as though to warn him to tread lightly with his response. then he goes ‚Äúuntil she stops acting like a dumbass i want space‚Äù

i. shit. you. not. she goes ‚ÄúWHAT IF SHE DIES?! and you never talk to her again! you two will never forgive yourselves!‚Äù ü§Øü§Øü§Ø then his grandpa says ‚Äúwhen i was younger and had my two daughters, my mom did the same thing yours did, and became possessive of our girls and disrespected our boundaries as parents. and i cut her off for 12 years. my daughters missed out on a relationship with their grandma for 12 years, and i realized it was MY responsibility to rekindle that relationship regardless of how mad i was at her personally.‚Äù

i corrected him and said ‚Äúactually that was fully your moms responsibility to correct her behavior and rekindle that relationship at regain access to your kids‚Äù and defeated, he went on about ‚Äúlook- (my husbands mom) is severely overweight and diabetic, she won‚Äôt be here for another ten years‚Äù (when i say severely i mean anywhere from 350-400 lbs but still that is a BULLSHIT excuse for him to pull on us) and THEN the grandma says ‚Äúplus you guys have to understand she just started going through menopause, her hormones are all crazy right now, she didn‚Äôt mean to upset you guys the other day‚Äù IM 19 weeks PREGNANT and i‚Äôm not crazy. the hormone excuse is BULLSHIT. my mom is also the exact same age as her and in menopause as well. so then my husband was going off about how she‚Äôs always been like this even before menopause and that she needs to stop being fucking crazy and we still want our space. 

the grandma says ‚Äúi get that but don‚Äôt let this go on for too long, SHE IS YOUR MOTHER may i remind you!‚Äù so because she pushed out my husband in 1999 she can continue to treat us like dogshit and be a crazy bitch and we just have to accept that? nah that‚Äôs not how my family or i operate. if you‚Äôre a shit person you‚Äôre cut out. blood doesn‚Äôt mean anything, you have to protect yourself and your kids.

after we left i told my husband ‚Äúlook, you can reach out to her all you want, you can maintain whatever semblance of a half assed relationship with your mom that you‚Äôve always had- but i‚Äôm done. that was my last straw. the fake fa√ßade her and i have been doing since i was 15 is exhausting, im not doing it anymore. she‚Äôs still going to have very limited access to our children, but you and her can work out whatever you want.‚Äù he said he still doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with her and we‚Äôre on the same page. his family thinks this is just going to blow over but it‚Äôs not. she‚Äôs called me racist, she‚Äôs said to my face that she wished my husband ended up with *this friend* and *this girl from his childhood* and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised he ended up with you‚Äù she has outwardly been a bitch to me for years. she makes passive aggressive posts directed at me on facebook. she hates my mom too, and i‚Äôm not playing this game anymore.

i guess the advice i‚Äôm looking for is how do i proceed, i know we are about to turn into the bad guys, maybe not to the aunt and cousins but definitely to the mom sister and grandparents. the grandparents are now very obviously her flying monkeys. the only thing i plan to reiterate if she comes on the camping trip and blows things up again is:

THE AMOUNT OF ACCESS YOU HAVE TO MY CHILDREN IS A DIRECT REFLECTION/RECIPROCATION TO THE LEVEL OF RESPECT THAT YOU SHOW TO ME. if you find your access is limited, then you need to check yourself, until then, ACCESS DENIED. ",80,1751393819.0,JUSTNOMIL,23,0.93,False

A little about me: For starters, I'm an avid book reader. I'm especially fond of romance and psychological thrillers. I have a passion for writing‚ÄîI like to jot down little ideas, kinda like excerpts I've thought of, and I also like writing poems. I do photography as well, but I'm still an amateur at that.   
Personality-wise, I'm quite introverted. I have a difficult time pushing myself to interact with people. I'm not much of a socializer; however, I am down to talk to anyone who approaches me first. Once you get to know me, you'll realize that I'm a pretty outgoing and cheerful person, despite having social anxiety, and I become caring and affectionate to people I become close with.  A fun fact about me is that I LOVE coffee. I can drink it anywhere, anytime, iced, hot, with additives, or even just straight up black. (I take my caffeine seriously, y'all)

I also LOVE music. Music is a huge part of my life. I can jam to any genre, and I'm always open to listening to new songs and getting introduced to new musicians/artists. Speaking of music, the LOML is dance. I have been performing for a little over a decade now‚Äî most of my performances consist of dancing and singing. I've been in my school's theater club for over three years. Dance has given me the confidence and optimism to express myself. It has also given me the determination to improve my self-esteem. It helps me big time. I mostly do hip hop, commercial, and femme, but hoping to learn more styles soon. (I'm very interested in ballroom)

Another interest of mine is fashion. I'm fond of clothes and shoes, and seeing them just gives me this unexplainable joy. If you're a person who also likes dressing up and aesthetics, I think that we'd get along well. (Also, if anyone knows where I can purchase cheap and good quality accessories and statement pieces, please do give me recommendations. Thank you<33)

  
So, yeah  
If y'all think we vibe, don't hesitate to hmu:))



ps: I'm from the Philippines, so if there are any fellow Filipinos or Fil-Chi's out there, that would be really cool

1lp91l1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1lp91l1/feed_by_mira_grant/,Feed by Mira Grant:,"Our story opens where countless stories have ended in the last twenty-six years: with an idiot‚Äîin this case, my brother Shaun‚Äîdeciding it would be a good idea to go out and poke a zombie with a stick to see what happens. As if we didn‚Äôt already know what happens when you mess with a zombie: The zombie turns around and bites you, and you become the thing you poked. This isn‚Äôt a surprise. It hasn‚Äôt been a surprise for more than twenty years, and if you want to get technical, it wasn‚Äôt a surprise then.  
  
¬† When the infected first appeared‚Äîheralded by screams that the dead were rising and judgment day was at hand‚Äîthey behaved just like the horror movies had been telling us for decades that they would behave. The only surprise was that this time, it was really happening.  
  
¬† There was no warning before the outbreaks began. One day, things were normal; the next, people who were supposedly dead were getting up and attacking anything that came into range. This was upsetting for everyone involved, except for the infected, who were past being upset about that sort of thing. The initial shock was followed by running and screaming, which eventually devolved into more infection and attacking, that being the way of things. So what do we have now, in this enlightened age twenty-six years after the Rising? We have idiots prodding zombies with sticks, which brings us full circle to my brother and why he probably won‚Äôt live a long and fulfilling life.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, George, check this out!‚Äù he shouted, giving the zombie another poke in the chest with his hockey stick. The zombie gave a low moan, swiping at him ineffectually. It had obviously been in a state of full viral amplification for some time and didn‚Äôt have the strength or physical dexterity left to knock the stick out of Shaun‚Äôs hands. I‚Äôll give Shaun this much: He knows not to bother the fresh ones at close range. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre playing patty-cake!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStop antagonizing the locals and get back on the bike,‚Äù I said, glaring from behind my sunglasses. His current buddy might be sick enough to be nearing its second, final death, but that didn‚Äôt mean there wasn‚Äôt a healthier pack roaming the area. Santa Cruz is zombie territory. You don‚Äôt go there unless you‚Äôre suicidal, stupid, or both. There are times when even I can‚Äôt guess which of those options applies to Shaun.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt talk right now! I‚Äôm busy making friends with the locals!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShaun Phillip Mason, you get back on this bike right now, or I swear to God, I am going to drive away and leave you here.‚Äù  
  
¬† Shaun looked around, eyes bright with sudden interest as he planted the end of his hockey stick at the center of the zombie‚Äôs chest to keep it at a safe distance. ‚ÄúReally? You‚Äôd do that for me? Because ‚ÄòMy Sister Abandoned Me in Zombie Country Without a Vehicle‚Äô would make a great article.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA posthumous one, maybe,‚Äù I snapped. ‚ÄúGet back on the goddamn bike!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIn a minute!‚Äù he said, laughing, and turned back toward his moaning friend.  
  
¬† In retrospect, that‚Äôs when everything started going wrong.  
  
¬† The pack had probably been stalking us since before we hit the city limits, gathering reinforcements from all over the county as they approached. Packs of infected get smarter and more dangerous the larger they become. Groups of four or less are barely a threat unless they can corner you, but a pack of twenty or more stands a good chance of breaching any barrier the uninfected try to put up. You get enough of the infected together and they‚Äôll start displaying pack hunting techniques; they‚Äôll start using actual tactics. It‚Äôs like the virus that‚Äôs taken them over starts to reason when it gets enough hosts in the same place. It‚Äôs scary as hell, and it‚Äôs just about the worst nightmare of anyone who regularly goes into zombie territory‚Äîgetting cornered by a large group that knows the land better than you do.  
  
¬† These zombies knew the land better than we did, and even the most malnourished and virus-ridden pack knows how to lay an ambush. A low moan echoed from all sides, and then they were shambling into the open, some moving with the slow lurch of the long infected, others moving at something close to a run. The runners led the pack, cutting off three of the remaining methods of escape before there was time to do more than stare. I looked at them and shuddered.  
  
¬† Fresh infected‚Äîreally fresh ones‚Äîstill look almost like the people that they used to be. Their faces show emotion, and they move with a jerkiness that could just mean they slept wrong the night before. It‚Äôs harder to kill something that still looks like a person, and worst of all, the bastards are fast. The only thing more dangerous than a fresh zombie is a pack of them, and I counted at least eighteen before I realized that it didn‚Äôt matter, and stopped bothering.  
  
¬† I grabbed my helmet and shoved it on without fastening the strap. If the bike went down, dying because my helmet didn‚Äôt stay on would be one of the better options. I‚Äôd reanimate, but at least I wouldn‚Äôt be aware of it. ‚ÄúShaun!‚Äù  
  
¬† Shaun whipped around, staring at the emerging zombies. ‚ÄúWhoa.‚Äù  
  
¬† Unfortunately for Shaun, the addition of that many zombies had turned his buddy from a stupid solo into part of a thinking mob. The  
zombie grabbed the hockey stick as soon as Shaun‚Äôs attention was focused elsewhere, yanking it out of his hands. Shaun staggered forward and the zombie latched onto his cardigan, withered fingers locking down with deceptive strength. It hissed. I screamed, images of my inevitable future as an only child filling my mind.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShaun!‚Äù One bite and things would get a lot worse. There‚Äôs not much worse than being cornered by a pack of zombies in downtown Santa Cruz. Losing Shaun would qualify.  
  
¬† The fact that my brother convinced me to take a dirt bike into zombie territory doesn‚Äôt make me an idiot. I was wearing full off-road body armor, including a leather jacket with steel armor joints attached at the elbows and shoulders, a Kevlar vest, motorcycling pants with hip and knee protectors, and calf-high riding boots. It‚Äôs bulky as hell, and I don‚Äôt care, because once you factor in my gloves, my throat‚Äôs the only target I present in the field.  
  
¬† Shaun, on the other hand, is a moron and had gone zombie baiting in nothing more defensive than a cardigan, a Kevlar vest, and cargo pants. He won‚Äôt even wear goggles‚Äîhe says they ‚Äúspoil the effect.‚Äù Unprotected mucous membranes can spoil a hell of a lot more than that, but I practically have to blackmail him to get him into the Kevlar. Goggles are a nonstarter.  
  
¬† There‚Äôs one advantage to wearing a sweater in the field, no matter how idiotic I think it is: wool tears. Shaun ripped himself free and turned, running for the motorcycle with great speed, which is really the only effective weapon we have against the infected. Not even the fresh ones can keep up with an uninfected human over a short sprint. We have speed, and we have bullets. Everything else about this fight is in their favor.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShit, George, we‚Äôve got company!‚Äù There was a perverse mixture of horror and delight in his tone. ‚ÄúLook at ‚Äòem all!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking! Now get on!‚Äù  
  
¬† I kicked us free as soon as he had his leg over the back of the bike and his arm around my waist. The bike leapt forward, tires bouncing and shuddering across the broken ground as I steered us into a wide curve. We needed to get out of there, or all the protective gear in the world wouldn‚Äôt do us a damn bit of good. I might live if the zombies caught up with us, but my brother would be dragged into the mob. I gunned the throttle, praying that God had time to preserve the life of the clinically suicidal.  
  
¬† We hit the last open route out of the square at twenty miles an hour, still gathering speed. Whooping, Shaun locked one arm around my waist and twisted to face the zombies, waving and blowing kisses in their direction. If it were possible to enrage a mob of the infected, he‚Äôd have managed it. As it was, they just moaned and kept following, arms extended toward the promise of fresh meat.  
  
¬† The road was pitted from years of weather damage without maintenance. I fought to keep control as we bounced from pothole to pothole. ‚ÄúHold on, you idiot!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm holding on!‚Äù Shaun called back, seeming happy as a clam and oblivious to the fact that people who don‚Äôt follow proper safety procedures around zombies‚Äîlike not winding up around zombies in the first place‚Äîtend to wind up in the obituaries.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHold on with both arms!‚Äù The moaning was only coming from three sides now, but it didn‚Äôt mean anything; a pack this size was almost certainly smart enough to establish an ambush. I could be driving straight to the site of greatest concentration. They‚Äôd moan in the end, once we were right on top of them. No zombie can resist a good moan when dinner‚Äôs at hand. The fact that I could hear them over the engine meant that there were too many, too close. If we were lucky, it wasn‚Äôt already too late to get away.  
  
¬† Of course, if we were lucky, we wouldn‚Äôt be getting chased by an army of zombies through the quarantine area that used to be downtown Santa Cruz. We‚Äôd be somewhere safer, like Bikini Atoll just before the bomb testing kicked off. Once you decide to ignore the hazard rating and the signs saying Danger: Infection, you‚Äôre on your own.  
  
¬† Shaun grudgingly slid his other arm around my waist and linked his hands at the pit of my stomach, shouting, ‚ÄúSpoilsport,‚Äù as he settled.  
  
¬† I snorted and hit the gas again, aiming for a nearby hill. When you‚Äôre being chased by zombies, hills are either your best friends or your burial ground. The slope slows them down, which is great, unless you hit the peak and find out that you‚Äôre surrounded, with nowhere left to run to.  
  
¬† Idiot or not, Shaun knows the rules about zombies and hills. He‚Äôs not as dumb as he pretends to be, and he knows more about surviving zombie encounters than I do. His grip on my waist tightened, and for the first time, there was actual concern in his voice as he shouted, ‚ÄúGeorge? What do you think you‚Äôre doing?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHold, on,‚Äù I said. Then we were rolling up the hill, bringing more zombies stumbling out of their hiding places behind trash cans and in the spaces between the once-elegant beachfront houses that were now settling into a state of neglected decay.  
  
¬† Most of California was reclaimed after the Rising, but no one has ever managed to take back Santa Cruz. The geographical isolation that once made the town so desirable as a vacation spot pretty much damned it when the virus hit. Kellis-Amberlee may be unique in the way it interacts with the human body, but it behaves just like every other communicable disease known to man in at least one way: Put it on a school campus and it spreads like wildfire. U.C. Santa Cruz was a perfect breeding ground, and once all those perky co-eds became the shuffling infected, it was all over but the evacuation notices.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGeorgia, this is a hill!‚Äù he said with increasing urgency as the locals lunged toward the speeding bike. He was using my proper name; that was how I could tell he was worried. I‚Äôm only ‚ÄúGeorgia‚Äù when he‚Äôs unhappy.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI got that.‚Äù I hunched over to decrease wind resistance a few more precious degrees. Shaun mimicked the motion automatically, hunching down behind me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy are we going up a hill?‚Äù he demanded. There was no way he‚Äôd be able to hear my answer over the combined roaring of the engine and the wind, but that‚Äôs my brother, always willing to question that which won‚Äôt talk back.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEver wonder how the Wright brothers felt?‚Äù I asked. The crest of the hill was in view. From the way the street vanished on the other side, it was probably a pretty steep drop. The moaning was coming from all sides now, so distorted by the wind that I had no real idea what we were driving into. Maybe it was a trap; maybe it wasn‚Äôt. Either way, it was too late to find another path. We were committed, and for once, Shaun was the one sweating.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGeorgia!‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHold on!‚Äù Ten yards. The zombies kept closing, single-minded in their pursuit of what might be the first fresh meat some had seen in years. From the looks of most of them, the zombie problem in Santa Cruz was decaying faster than it was rebuilding itself. Sure, there were plenty of fresh ones‚Äîthere are always fresh ones because there are always idiots who wander into quarantined zones, either willingly or by mistake, and the average hitchhiker doesn‚Äôt get lucky where zombies are concerned‚Äîbut we‚Äôll take the city back in another three generations. Just not today.  
  
¬† Five yards.  
  
¬† Zombies hunt by moving toward the sound of other zombies hunting. It‚Äôs recursive, and that meant our friends at the base of the hill started for the peak when they heard the commotion. I was hoping so many of the locals had been cutting us off at ground level that they wouldn‚Äôt have many bodies left to mount an offensive on the hill‚Äôs far side. We weren‚Äôt supposed to make it that far, after all; the only thing keeping us alive was the fact that we had a motorcycle and the zombies didn‚Äôt.  
  
¬† I glimpsed the mob waiting for us as we reached the top. They were standing no more than three deep. Fifteen feet would see us clear.  
  
¬† Liftoff.  
  
¬† It‚Äôs amazing what you can use for a ramp, given the right motivation. Someone‚Äôs collapsed fence was blocking half the road, jutting up at an angle, and I hit it at about fifty miles an hour. The handlebars shuddered in my hands like the horns of a mechanical bull, and the shocks weren‚Äôt doing much better. I didn‚Äôt even have to check the road in front of  
us because the moaning started as soon as we came into view. They‚Äôd blocked our exit fairly well while Shaun played with his little friend, and mindless plague carriers or not, they had a better grasp of the local geography than we did. We still had one advantage: Zombies aren‚Äôt good at predicting suicide charges. And if there‚Äôs a better term for driving up the side of a hill at fifty miles an hour with the goal of actually achieving flight when you run out of ‚Äúup,‚Äù I don‚Äôt think I want to hear it.  
  
¬† The front wheel rose smoothly and the back followed, sending us into the air with a jerk that looked effortless and was actually scarier than hell. I was screaming. Shaun was whooping with gleeful understanding. And then everything was in the hands of gravity, which has never had much love for the terminally stupid. We hung in the air for a heart-stopping moment, still shooting forward. At least I was fairly sure the impact would kill us.  
  
¬† The laws of physics and the hours of work I‚Äôve put into constructing and maintaining my bike combined to let the universe, for once, show mercy. We soared over the zombies, coming down on one of the few remaining stretches of smooth road with a bone-bruising jerk that nearly ripped the handlebars out of my grip. The front wheel went light on impact, trying to rise up, and I screamed, half terrified, half furious with Shaun for getting us into this situation in the first place. The handlebars shuddered harder, almost wrenching my arms out of their sockets before I hit the gas and forced the wheel back down. I‚Äôd pay for this in the morning, and not just with the repair bills.  
  
¬† Not that it mattered. We were on level ground, we were upright, and there was no moaning ahead. I hit the gas harder as we sped toward the outskirts of town, with Shaun whooping and cheering behind me like a big suicidal freak.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAsshole,‚Äù I muttered, and drove on.  
  
¬† News is news and spin is spin, and when you introduce the second to the first, what you have isn‚Äôt news anymore. Hey, presto, you‚Äôve created opinion.  
¬†Don‚Äôt get me wrong, opinion is powerful. Being able to be presented with differing opinions on the same issue is one of the glories of a free media, and it should make people stop and think. But a lot of people don‚Äôt want to. They don‚Äôt want to admit that whatever line being touted by their idol of the moment might not be unbiased and without ulterior motive. We‚Äôve got people who claim Kellis-Amberlee was a plot by the Jews, the gays, the Middle East, even a branch of the Aryan Nation trying to achieve racial purity by killing the rest of us. Whoever orchestrated the creation and release of the virus masked their involvement with a conspiracy of Machiavellian proportions, and now they and their followers are sitting it out, peacefully immunized, waiting for the end of the world.  
  
¬† Pardon the expression, but I can smell the bullshit from here. Conspiracy? Cover up? I‚Äôm sure there are groups out there crazy enough to think killing thirty-two percent of the world‚Äôs population in a single summer is a good idea‚Äîand remember, that‚Äôs a conservative estimate, since we‚Äôve never gotten accurate death tolls out of Africa, Asia, or parts of South America‚Äîbut are any of them nuts enough to do it by turning what used to be Grandma loose to chew on people at random? Zombies don‚Äôt respect conspiracy. Conspiracy is for the living.  
  
¬† This piece is opinion. Take it as you will. But get your opinions the hell away from my news.  
  
¬† ‚ÄîFrom Images May Disturb You, the blog of Georgia Mason, September 3, 2039  
  
¬† Zombies are pretty harmless as long as you treat them with respect. Some people say you should pity the zombie, empathize with the zombie, but I think they? Are likely to become the zombie, if you get my meaning. Don‚Äôt feel sorry for the zombie. The zombie‚Äôs not going to feel sorry for you when he starts gnawing on your head. Sorry, dude, but not even my sister gets to know me that well.  
  
¬† If you want to deal with zombies, stay away from the teeth, don‚Äôt let them scratch you, keep your hair short, and don‚Äôt wear loose clothes. It‚Äôs that simple. Making it more complicated would be boring, and who wants that? We have what basically amounts to walking corpses, dude.  
  
¬† Don‚Äôt suck all the fun out of it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄîFrom Hail to the King, the blog of Shaun Mason, January 2, 2039  
  
¬† Two  
  
¬† Neither of us spoke as we drove through the remains of Santa Cruz. There were no signs of movement, and the buildings were getting widely spaced enough that visual tracking was at least partially reliable. I started to relax as I took the first exit onto Highway 1, heading south. From there, we could cut over to Highway 152, which would take us into Watsonville, where we‚Äôd left the van.  
  
¬† Watsonville is another of Northern California‚Äôs ‚Äúlost towns.‚Äù It was surrendered to the infected after the summer of 2014, but it‚Äôs safer than Santa Cruz, largely due to its geographical proximity to Gilroy, which is still a protected farming community. This means that while no one‚Äôs willing to live in Watsonville for fear that the zombies will shamble down from Santa Cruz in the middle of the night, the good people of Gilroy aren‚Äôt willing to let the infected have it either. They go in three times a year with flamethrowers and machine guns and clean the place out. That keeps Watsonville deserted, and lets the California farmers continue to feed the population.  
  
¬† I pulled off to the side of the road outside the ruins of a small town called Aptos, near the Highway 1 onramp. There was flat ground in all directions, giving us an adequate line of sight on anything that might be looking for a snack. My bike was running rough enough that I wanted to get a good look at it, and adding more gas probably wouldn‚Äôt hurt. Dirt bikes have small tanks, and we‚Äôd covered a lot of miles already.  
  
¬† Shaun turned toward me as he dismounted, grinning from ear to ear. The wind had raked his hair into a series of irregular spikes and snarls, making him look like he‚Äôd been possessed. ‚ÄúThat,‚Äù he said, with almost religious fervor, ‚Äúwas the coolest thing you have ever done. In fact, that may have been the coolest thing you ever will do. Your entire existence has been moving toward one shining moment, George, and that was the moment when you thought, ‚ÄòHey, why don‚Äôt I just go over the zombies?‚Äô ‚Äù He paused for effect. ‚ÄúYou are possibly cooler than God.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYet another chance to be free of you, down the drain.‚Äù I hopped off the bike and pulled off my helmet, starting to assess the most obvious problems. They looked minor, but I still intended to get them looked at as soon as possible. Some damage was beyond my admittedly limited mechanical capabilities, and I was sure I‚Äôd managed to cause most of it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get another one.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the hope that keeps me going.‚Äù I balanced my helmet against the windscreen before unzipping the right saddlebag and removing the gas can. Setting the can on the ground, I pulled out the first-aid kit. ‚ÄúBlood test time.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGeorge‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou know the rules. We‚Äôve been in the field, and we don‚Äôt go back to base until we‚Äôve checked our virus levels.‚Äù I extracted two small handheld testing units, holding one out to him. ‚ÄúNo levels, no van. No van, no coffee. No coffee, no joy. Do you want the joy, Shaun, or would you rather stand out here and argue with me about whether you‚Äôre going to let me test your blood?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre burning cool by the minute here,‚Äù he grumbled, and took the unit.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay with that,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs see if I‚Äôll live.‚Äù  
  
¬† Moving with synchronicity born of long practice, we broke the biohazard seals and popped the plastic lids off our testing units, exposing the sterile metal pressure pads. Basic field test units only work once, but they‚Äôre cheap and necessary.
