# Terlingua – January 15

The sun was waking up.  
You thought I was sleeping.  
Wrapped tight in your blanket  
you held your coffee like hope.  
I watched you play with birds.

You crept behind cover like you wouldn’t be seen.  
They kept you a bush away,  
close enough to keep you chasing.  
In that moment I saw you for you,  
before I knew your depths.  
That morning I knew I would love you.

# Salt Flat – February 23

We drove all day,  
but it felt like an instant.  
We talked about everything, nothing,  
subtle glances,  
soft touches.  
We knew we were onto something,  
neither of us had to say it.

When we got to our camp the sky was on fire.  
I know it was performing.  
Mirroring what it saw in us.  
Finally something tangible,  
like we put it there ourselves.  
We hadn’t said it yet but our eyes knew the words.

# Santa Rosa Beach – May 4

Handshakes and smiles.  
Talking about my job.  
Four generations together.  
My first time meeting most of them.  
My time to shine.  
But really,  
seeing your role, your peace, your glow.  
Daughter, sister, mother, rock.  
Watching your smile fill the room.  
Your warmth filled my heart.

The three of us shared a room.  
We made love that night while >!NAME\*!< slept.  
Quiet, but on fire.  
I held you so tight.  
You always fit like you were made for me.  
You surrendered.  
It made you stronger.

# Gila Hot Springs – May 26

Who gets this far away just to run and look at stars with someone they love?  
What do we see here that we don’t see at home?

I see you.  
At peace. Decompressed.  
Curious. Soft.  
Your touches, your words,  
I’m in awe of your poise.  
Are we finding our stride?  
Is this comfort safe?

We share the same love,  
for each other, in life.  
We don’t take it for granted.  
Like air or a date circled on the calendar,  
we don’t have to talk about it,  
but we know it’s there.  
In this moment our time is eternal.

**Cuchara – July 4**

Our first two bedroom cabin.  
Our first family trip.

Taking turns.  
Building trust.

Walkie talkies, shoulder rides, and bears.  
Stomach born laughter.

She was perfect.  
And you were happy.

Our corner of heaven,  
It was all we needed.

# Crestone – October 12

Just meet me in the middle.  
I’m waiting.

I built my house on your cliffs,  
but I don’t fear the waves.  
I’ve felt the softness of your touch.

I would let you tear me apart,  
but I know you won’t,  
I’ve heard the softness of your voice.

Let me tear you apart.  
Trust the strength of my love.

# Jemez Springs – February 14

We ran through the mountains together.  
Not for the first time,  
but I didn’t know it would be our last.

7000’.  
It was snowing, we didn’t hesitate.  
We never did when it came to running.

Later I asked for your hand,  
and told you I’d give you my life  
if you just said yes.

(I thought) the answer came easy.  
Things always did when we didn’t fight it.  
“It shouldn’t be this hard.”

Now I look back at this trip,  
and I can’t remember the details.  
Am I protecting myself or are you already a fading memory?

**Home Depot Parking Lot – May 20**

I was five minutes early.  
You were ten minutes late.

You always said I overthink things,  
but I swear it means something this time.

We both had our notes ready.  
The first ones we’ve written that weren’t about our love.

Yours was polished and folded neatly.  
You always focused on the small details.

I know mine was messy.  
Why does my writing always get worse at the bottom of the page?

It’s hard being the one that’s left behind.  
Am I supposed to feel like a child?

I almost ran back to my car after you gave me the ring.  
Didn’t it fit right? Didn’t you like the way it shined?

You were supposed to wear it forever.  
Now it’s just a memory.

He had decent photos, seemed friendly, you know, the usual stuff you'd expect. 

But then... I hit his profile description, and there it was: a bold statement about how he refuses to date anyone who eats pineapple on pizza. 🍍 Like, not even a ""preferably not,"" but a firm ""will not date."" 

Naturally, being the slightly rebellious person I am (and someone who enjoys a good Hawaiian pizza every now and then), I couldn't resist swiping right just to see how fixed he really was on this bromance-disrupting fruit.

Our convo started out pretty smooth, just the usual chatting about our favorite shows, why we were online dating, etc... But then, I playfully asked about his pizza dealbreaker. He responded with a very serious ""it's a matter of principle."" I was like, ""Oh really? What if it's amazing pizza?"" 

Suddenly, it's like I had triggered the Pineapple Protocol or something, because he launched into a full-on roast of my pizza choices, 😂. It was the most passionate debate I've ever had over a topping! 

Eventually, we just laughed it off, and tbh, it was such a hilariously bizarre reason to swipe left on someone, that we actually did end up going out for a coffee (sans pizza topping arguments)!

1krwb57,https://i.redd.it/iuzj79gnm42f1.jpeg,Bloom Phase - To Stir or Not to Stir?,"I’ve mostly been brewing with Tetsu’s 4:6 method, which doesn’t involve stirring or swirling at all. It’s super simple and clean, and I like how repeatable it is, but lately I’ve been wondering if I’m missing something by not agitating during the bloom.

I haven’t tried stirring or swirling myself yet, but I’ve seen people mention that it can help with more even saturation, especially with really fresh coffees that release a lot of CO2. In theory, that makes sense: if gas is pushing water away from parts of the coffee bed, maybe a quick swirl helps prevent uneven extraction. But I’m curious how noticeable the effect really is in the cup.

For those of you who stir or swirl during bloom:

* What kind of difference do you taste (if any)?
* Do you always do it, or only with certain coffees?
* Have you done side-by-side comparisons?

I’m planning to run a side-by-side soon, but I’m curious what to expect. What should I be looking (or tasting) for if it really makes a difference?",3,1747829680.0,pourover,2,1.0,False
1krwajr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pppdizziness/comments/1krwajr/mitolyn_reviews_and_complaints_used_365_days_an/,MITOLYN Reviews and ComplaintS:~ (Used 365 Days) An Honest Customer 2025 Review!,"Hey everyone,

After a full year — 365 days — of using MITOLYN, I’m finally ready to share a long-term, no-fluff review. I know there’s a lot of hype around “mitochondrial health” supplements lately, and like many of you, I’ve tried my share of energy boosters, brain fog fixes, and nootropic stacks that didn’t deliver.

MITOLYN was different. Not instant, not flashy, but real. Over time, it helped me rebuild my energy, mental clarity, and even my emotional stability in a way that stuck.

If you're thinking about trying MITOLYN or just curious whether mitochondrial support actually works, here’s everything I experienced over the past year.

What is MITOLYN?
MITOLYN is a daily supplement designed to support and enhance mitochondrial function — meaning it helps your cells produce more natural energy by optimizing how they generate ATP (the body’s cellular fuel). The goal is to restore energy from the inside out, rather than temporarily stimulate it like caffeine or sugar.

If you’ve dealt with persistent fatigue, brain fog, low motivation, or stress-related burnout, MITOLYN aims to help at the root level: your cell’s ability to function properly.

What’s in MITOLYN?
The formula caught my eye right away. MITOLYN contains clinically backed ingredients with real science behind them:

CoQ10 – Supports ATP production and protects mitochondria from damage.

PQQ – Stimulates the creation of new mitochondria.

Acetyl-L-Carnitine – Helps with mental sharpness, fat metabolism, and energy.

Alpha Lipoic Acid – An antioxidant that improves mitochondrial efficiency.

NAD+ Precursors – For mitochondrial repair and anti-aging benefits.

B-Complex, Magnesium, and Rhodiola Rosea – To support energy metabolism and reduce stress.

The formulation is clean — no caffeine, no fillers, no synthetic junk. Just a thoughtful combination of compounds that help your body generate sustained, healthy energy over time.

My Experience Using MITOLYN for 12 Months
I started MITOLYN while feeling completely drained, both mentally and physically. Burnout was hitting hard, and nothing else seemed to help long-term. Here’s what the last 12 months looked like.

Months 1–2: Subtle Shifts
Energy was still low, but I noticed less morning grogginess after a couple of weeks.

My afternoon crashes started fading — I wasn’t reaching for extra coffee or sugar.

My mental clarity began improving slowly but noticeably.

Months 3–4: Consistency Pays Off
Energy throughout the day was more stable.

Brain fog almost entirely disappeared.

I felt more productive and found it easier to focus for longer periods.

Months 5–6: Mental and Physical Improvements
Workouts felt easier. I started walking more, lifting again, and recovering faster.

My mood improved — I was more emotionally balanced and less reactive to stress.

Sleep became more restful and consistent.

Months 7–9: Peak Benefits
Clear-headed from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed.

More motivated, focused, and creative at work.

I was able to take on more without feeling drained or overwhelmed.

Months 10–12: Long-Term Resilience
I felt more mentally sharp, physically active, and emotionally grounded.

Fewer colds, quicker recovery, and a noticeable improvement in overall health.

My energy levels today feel better than they did in my twenties (I’m 37 now).

What I Liked About MITOLYN
No crashes, no stimulation – The energy feels natural and sustainable.

Better mental clarity – It’s easier to focus, plan, and stay motivated.

Emotional stability – I feel calmer and more in control under pressure.

Great formulation – No garbage ingredients or hype-based marketing.

Long-term effectiveness – It gets better the longer you take it.

What Could Be Improved
The price is on the higher end, but the value has been worth it for me.

It requires consistency — results build over time, not overnight.

Only available online at the moment, which isn’t ideal for everyone.

Final Verdict After 365 Days
MITOLYN delivered what it promised: long-term improvements in energy, mental performance, and mood. It’s not a quick fix, but rather a foundational tool for rebuilding vitality from the inside out.",1,1747829631.0,pppdizziness,0,1.0,False

**• Roaster’s Notes:** Stone fruit, pears, molasses

——————-

**• Equipment:** April Ceramic Brewer, ZP6 at 4
**• Brew Ratio:** 12g coffee : 200ml water

I got this coffee from PCE two weeks ago. The roast level indicated is medium. Since Catimor is known for its sharp acidity, I figured it benefits from a bit more development time during roasting and it turned out quite nice! It had a medium body, a creamy texture and finish, and some subtle caramel notes ☺️

It’s also my first time trying Escolta and I liked seeing that they focus on local coffees :)

Speaking of local coffee, any idea when the PCQC winning coffee from Benguet will be released? I think Equilibrium Trade won the bid, do they roast themselves or work with partner roasters? Para alam saan mag-aabang 😄

This betrayal causes a  lot of distress to Jemima, which Heather is determined to avenge. She confronts the group in  her local coffee shop, where she overhears them discussing their 'Bank of Mum and Dad ' funding,  in contrast to their public image of 'Art from the streets'.

I have my instant coffee, it's my every day go to. Why? Because it's easy and it tastes OK - even great sometimes, I'm awful I know. But I also have a Moka Pot and beans from a local coffee shop and a Dreo Baristamaker for the milk. Also great, but not easy - or at least it takes time and there clean up and ugh....

So, I've been looking around for a solution to getting good coffee with milk, at home, with minimal work and fuzz, without going broke:

One solution is the Aeropress. I know, I know, it's not espresso but honestly will I even be able to tell the difference when mixed with milk given my terrible palate? It look super easy and fast and minimal clean up. And very, very cheap. 

The other solution is grabbing a Breville Bambino Plus (slightly used for $380). From reviews it actually looks like you can get very decent espresso with minimal effort, while still letting you try different beans and steaming milk manually, which is a plus for me. I honestly am not looking for a new hobby and I dread having to spend my nights fiddling with things in order to get something drinkable. 

Then of course I need a grinder - oof this one is hard, because honestly with the Breville my budget is almost spent. But I've read good things about the Turin H40/iCafilas and the price isn't bad at all. There's also the K6, which costs a bit more. 

Right now I can also get a second hand Quick Mill Apollo super cheap ($70) which is electil/electric and that just adds more ease of use, which is a big one for me. It needs to be easy or I won't work on an every day basis. 

Before looking at the Bambino I actually thought about a Flair, but decided there was too much 'work' involved so started looking for machines that could do some of the work for me.

Right now I'm leaning towards the Bambino with a grinder, but overthinking is a trait of mine, so here I am asking for advice. 

I've been around reddit, YouTube, Google, Hoffman and Hedrick, you name it - but information overload haha! Also, I'm a super noob who likes coffee with milk, lots of info I find is aimed and seasoned espresso drinkers and baristas.

Stick to instant or take the plunge? 

If you made it this far, phew, well done - thank you for your time :)",1,1747829023.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1krw35q,https://www.reddit.com/r/BGC_Taguig/comments/1krw35q/entitled_foreigner_demands_refund_over_wifi_at/,Entitled Foreigner Demands Refund Over WiFi at Coffee Bean,"Earlier today, I witnessed something at Coffee Bean in High Street that really didn’t sit right with me. A foreigner—an American man, probably in his mid-40s—walked in and immediately demanded to speak to the manager. He acted as if it was something urgent, something serious. But when the manager came over, it turned out the only thing he was upset about was the WiFi not working. That’s it. The WiFi.

Despite the staff already preparing his coffee, he insisted on getting a refund. He argued that the internet was part of what he was paying for, and if it wasn’t working, he shouldn’t have to pay at all. There was no effort to understand the situation, no patience, no kindness—just entitlement. I could see the manager trying to keep their composure, but you could tell the pressure was real. It’s very possible that the cost of that coffee would be taken out of their pay, or at the very least, they’d be questioned for it.

What made it worse was how cold he was. The moment he got his drink, he didn’t even say thank you or make eye contact with the staff. He just walked out like nothing happened, like he hadn’t caused a scene over something so petty.

Honestly, I found the whole thing selfish and disrespectful. It’s frustrating to see people come here and act like they can bully their way into getting what they want, especially at the expense of hardworking employees who are just trying to do their jobs. We need to stop normalizing this kind of behavior—foreigner or not, nobody should get a pass for treating others poorly.

I didn’t step in at the time because, honestly, it wasn’t my place. It wasn’t my business, and I didn’t want to escalate the situation or make things more uncomfortable for the staff. But I’ve been thinking about it ever since, and it’s been bothering me. Sometimes you witness something that, even if you're not directly involved, just sticks with you because it feels so wrong. I guess I just needed to get this off my chest—because staying silent doesn’t mean you’re okay with what happened.",1,1747828979.0,BGC_Taguig,1,0.67,False

Did my annual mulching in the fall and fertilizing in the spring. I added a dozen ranunculus and irises to see what would happen. The early spring daffodils and tulips were a whole show! The iris and ranunculus came in sparsely but right when the tulips died off, I have hope I can keep adding to them to fill the garden out into late spring. I spread a quarter pound of wildflower seeds across both beds as well, though that is more interesting to the birds so not sure how much will come to flower.

1krw1dr,https://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/1krw1dr/what_mbti_am_i_likely_to_be/,What MBTI am I likely to be?,"* Below is a questionnaire, kindly given to me by another user on this subreddit, that I had filled out. Can someone help me do an analysis? Any help would be greatly appreciated. \[P.S. I know my user tag says INFJ but that's based off online tests like Michael Caloz and 16p, but I wanted a more accurate analysis\]
* Te-A. 
* Q: What would you consider to be productive work? How would you measure this? What are some factors that may affect someone or something’s efficiency? Provide some examples. 
* A: I would consider productive work to be literally solving any problem that exists that is limiting someone or a group of people’s ability to achieve a certain goal or ideal situation. How I would measure it, it depends on the situation and what metric it calls for. If it is solving a financial problem in a corporate, I’d say it’s about stabilising or increasing profits and cutting losses while keeping the negative affects to the system that drives it (tools, employees) to a minimum. If it is about solving an emotional crisis, it would be bringing the person back to a healthy mental state of mind (not about being happy or sad, but being in a healthy medium that is on neither extreme to allow them a balanced emotional experience) while keeping negative effect to the people around them to a minimum. Factors that may affect someone’s efficiency might include distractions, such as family problems. For example, a sick parent may require someone to take care of that parent instead of building on whatever it was they were supposed to work towards.
* Te-B. 
* Q: Think of a time where you needed to complete a difficult task. How did you approach managing the workflow? Why? How can you tell apart logical and illogical workflows or methods of action? 
* A: When approaching managing the workflow, the first thing I did was to identify my main objective. This gives me a clear direction of what everything I am doing should work towards, so I do not do things that I think “could help”; everything “should help”. My way of telling apart logical and illogical workflows or methods of action would be to identify if they work towards improving the metric that appropriately measures progress towards a goal, or identifying the reason behind a workflow or method of action; if it was done because someone thought it was the best course of action, or if it was done because “that’s how it’s usually done”. 
* Te-C. 
* Q: How can someone make a set of rules or instructions easy to follow? When people aren’t properly following directions or procedures, how do you correct them? When should you?
* A: Someone can make a set of rules or instructions easy to follow by being short and forthright; give the necessary instructions first, and should anyone need more context or have more questions, that’s to be answered later. When people aren’t properly following directions or procedures, I would first like to understand whether it is an incapability problem or a willingness problem. If it is an incapability problem, I would ideally sit them down and guide them through the objective and allow them to understand what they’re doing is supposed to do; what objective it solves and the metric that is used to measure their progress. If it is a willingness issue, I will further understand what is their true passion and try to redirect them to something that better suits their passions and skills to allow them to be productive and continue to contribute in a sector where they may be more efficient due to the simple fact that it plays at their strengths. I should correct these people when I identify that they are not productive when they need to be.
* Te-D. 
* Q: What would you consider a normal level of activity? Is it always necessary to maintain this? Why or why not? How can you tell if someone is overexerting or underexerting themselves? 
* A: I would say it is hard to have a specific normal level of activity, and it depends greatly on what the objective calls for. I don’t really have a specific metric to measure whether someone is overexerting or underexerting themselves; I would say it’s a little more complicated and it is something I’d ideally like to figure out over a coffee.
* Te-E. 
* Q: Think of an activity you’re interested in which requires certain physical or mechanical skills. How would you differentiate a good and bad technique? What makes these techniques effective or ineffective? How aware of you of your own performance? 
* A: I enjoy Table Tennis. To differentiate a good and bad technique, I would say it is based on the energy efficiency of the technique (Joules of energy exerted per stroke to attain a given quality of ball returned \[quality = speed x spin\]). What makes these techniques effective or ineffective is whether they achieve the wanted objective (a slow ball is ineffective if a fastball was wanted; a fast ball is ineffective if a slowball was wanted). I would say I am fairly aware of my own performance as I am perpetually visualising the travel of every atom in the space, and linking that to whatever would have been the best play on the table per turn.
* Fe-A. 
* Q: To what extent does someone’s emotional state affect a person’s being? How does your emotional state affect your everyday life? When does your true emotional state differ from what you express?
* A: I believe someone’s emotional state affects a person’s being to a large extent. My emotional state affects my everyday life in the sense that it affects my irritability, my patience, even my motivation. My true emotional state may differ from what I express pretty much whenever I am around people. My true emotional state may affect my irritability, patience, and motivation, which may affect the quality of what I express, but what I actually express is very much based on what I believe the people around me need: if I am around friends who I think need encouragement, I will have quite an encouraging expression; if I am around people who I think are affecting those around them negatively, I might express myself in a way such that the decisions I make might indirectly “teach them what they should be doing in a more socially or morally acceptable way”, even if I have to take myself down, as long as I take them down with me, for the sake of the others (I would honestly hit an adult pedestrian walking on a bicycles only path so that they never do it again so that other cyclists would not have to deal with them, even if it means I get in some trouble).
* Fe-B. 
* Q: How important is it for someone to be inspired and excited about what they’re doing? Why? How can people actively inspire others?
* A: I think this is the most important factor that should affect someone when they are doing something. Someone may be capable, extremely smart and knowledgeable, but it wouldn’t necessarily drive them to do the thing they need to do. For the drive that drives them to do the thing they need to do, inspiration and excitement are probably the most stable and intrinsic drivers compared to material rewards such as recognition or money, which will last and drive them to do what they need to do even when there is no real motivator other than literally just doing the right thing and what’s necessary. It is difficult to inspire others intrinsically, but I think one way would be to just let them understand the greater good of what they are doing.
* Fe-C. 
* Q: What role do negative emotions, including anger, play in people’s lives? What causes them? Are they intrinsically valuable? Why or why not? What can be learned from negative emotions?
* A: Such emotions may cause people to act irrationally and make decisions that may negatively affect those around them. These can be caused by a multitude of things, including feeling injustice from the people around them. They may be intrinsically valuable since while they could drive some people to make irrational decisions, it could also drive some people to fight for change for the better. Negative emotions may not necessarily be bad, but it really depends on how the built up energy is released.
* Fe-D. 
* Q: In your view, what does it mean to be calm? How can someone reduce the amount of emotionality happening in others around them? When would it be appropriate to adjust this? 
* A: To be calm would be to experience emotions at a stable, low energy state, at a healthy level. Someone can reduce their amount of emotionality happening in others around them depending on what caused the emotionality: if it is an emotionality caused by a problem, the best way to reduce the emotionality would probably be either to solve that problem and put everyone at ease. If it is an emotionality caused by fear of a system that is put in place for a greater good but has a rough start, the best way to reduce the emotionality would probably be to reach to everyone and let them know that they are experiencing this pain for a greater good and that they need to let it simmer, to give them peace of mind that there is no need to fear.
* Fe-E. 
* Q: How can you tell how someone is feeling? Describe some signs to look for. What are some giveaways that someone’s internal state is different from what they’re expressing on the outside?
* A: The most obvious ways to tell how someone is feeling would definitely be to read their body language: you may know textbook signs or you may have an instinctive understanding built on past experiences and lessons, but you could definitely read someone’s emotional state to some degree by just looking at their body language. Personally I never took note of specific signs in words, it is most definitely something I understand while looking at someone holistically, “I just know it” if I may. To know when someone’s internal state is different from their external expression, it is something I also cannot describe but generally understand. However, outside of just “reading”, I think it makes more sense for me to actually talk to them and understand their intentions, and from there evaluate whether their external expression matches their intentions; but that is an extreme case. Usually for simplicity sake and having trust in people, I will just accept what they say at face value to respect whatever wishes they have, unless I sense those wishes to be malicious.
* Se-A. 
* Q: To what extent does an individual’s appearance and external presentation affect them? How aware are you of the way you come off? Should people always consider how they look? Why or why not?
* A: An individual’s appearance and external presentation generally affects them to a large extent as it commonly affects people’s impressions or assumptions of them. Some might too argue that someone’s appearance and presentation affects how they feel when they are about and about, affecting their confidence or feel for “the vibe they should carry”. I believe I am not too accurately aware of how I come off. People should consider how they present themselves in certain cases for formalities sake (business meeting, meeting a person they respect or should respect), however unless they feel a reason to, I think there shouldn’t be a great need for people to consider how they look.
* Se-B. 
* Q: Describe your view on money. What can it do for someone, and how does access to it affect people? What are your thoughts on riskier approaches to attaining it, such as risky investments or criminal activity? 
* A: The obvious about money’s use for people with access to it is that it grants people buying power. This could be good for people as it may fund them the ability push for change for the greater good, but it could also feed some people’s greed. For risky investments, I think it is important to identify and accept them as gambles, and be aware that your money can be easily lost, and that that lost is your responsibility and your problem to solve. For criminal activity, there is no reason to attain money this way. Even if attaining the money is for a greater good, the actual process of attaining it still hurts some people in the process. There is always a better way than to stoop to criminal activity. 
* Se-C. 
* Q: What would you consider your short and long term material goals? How do they compare to the goals of others? How can you tell if someone is striving for the right goals? 
* A: Short term material goals may be getting my dream bicycle, maybe a house, a car; unimportant, but if I had to attain something, why not. My long term material goals may be more so attaining investments that grow my money further. I don’t necessarily know how they compare to the goals of others, and I am generally not concerned with comparing what I want to others. For me to tell if someone is striving for the right goals, I would think if it aligns with their personal moral compass and value system, or if it is a want out of significance; an attainment that brings no real benefit to them.
* Se-D.
* Q: What makes a person or organization look “put-together”? Are these people and groups more able to exert their will over others? Why or why not? What makes a person good at organizing and directing the will of themselves and others? 
* A: I would say a factor that makes a person or organisation look put-together could be having a strong main objective for clear direction. These people and groups will definitely be more able to exert their will over others as this causes them to know exactly what they want to accomplish and makes it much easier for them to map out what they need to do, and the rationale behind everything they do. Something that makes a person good at organising and directing the will of themselves and others will probably have to be having a main objective and strong value system behind it. Motivation can be explained with rationale, mindset is set, and method can be easily derived.
* Se-E. 
* Q: One famous English adage is that “If there is a will, there is a way.” Do you agree? Why or why not? To what extent an individual’s will affect their ability to accomplish their goals? 

A: I agree. I believe anything can be done, regardless of its difficulty. The limiting factor is always how much you want to accomplish your goal, which affects how much time and effort you are willing to put in. I believe an individual’s will can affect their ability to accomplish goals to a large extent as I believe a party’s will is always the base limiting factor in any goal; there may be other limiting factors like monetary funds, people management, but all of these are affected by and solvable by a will eventually.

* Ne-A. 
* Q: What would you consider to be the essence – or meaning – of existence? Should life’s meaning be personal or collectively shared by humanity? Why? 
* A: I think the meaning of existence is complicated, but for me I’d say there’s probably a few things at the very least: contribution to the development of society and the human race, enjoying life to the best of human’s very limited ability to enjoy life, and reproduction. I think life’s meaning should be both personal and collectively shared by humanity as while development of society is important, it’s people who drive it. Each individual life should have meaning in order to drive for meaning of humanity. 
* Ne-B. 
* Q: What makes someone have potential? What makes an individual more capable at something than others? When is it important to consider these capabilities? Can a person be truly hopeless? Why or why not? 
* A: I think someone having potential is just having room to be better. An individual’s capability at something may be their knowledge and skills applicability in that field of activity. I think a person can never be completely truly hopeless, unless they are dead; then they are hopeless. Otherwise, there is literally no possibility where there is no possibility to further be better; it can be difficult, but possibility is never 0.
* Ne-C. 
* Q: What must an individual understand to physically and spiritually develop themselves? Is it more important to recognize the flaws or the strengths that people are given? Why? 
* A: I would say look at who or what they want to become and learn about or from them, and see if they would like to apply it to their own lives. I think it is more important to recognise strengths than flaws in other people. I think it is more valuable to have someone with developed strengths and unmanaged flaws that can contribute if their flaws are tolerated or externally managed than to have someone with underdeveloped strengths and managed flaws that may more more incapable of contributing despite not being a nuisance.
* Ne-D. 
* Q: How would you determine how good an idea is? Do these ideas need to be realistic to be worthwhile? How would you differentiate a promising opportunity from a dead end? A: I would say you can measure how good an idea is by its effectiveness to solve the issue. I do think ideas generally should be realistic to be worthwhile, especially when the discussion is about problem solving. However, I am aware that some conversations exist solely to explore hypotheticals, even if said hypotheticals have a near impossible chance of happening. I would differentiate a promising opportunity from a dead end based on whether it can possibly lead to accomplishing the main objective.
* Ne-E. 
* Q: What does it mean for someone to understand the “essence” of something? When should someone prioritize understanding the core characteristics of a phenomenon? Think of a topic or field of interest you are knowledgeable in. What do you think lies at the essence of it? What does this suggest about the way people should approach it?
* A: I think to understand the essence of something means to be so familiar with a concept’s meaning that you can utilise it as if it is second nature, even if you may not necessarily be able to explain it. I think prioritising understanding the core characteristics of a phenomenon is important if you have time to spare to internalise it and need dead accurate further findings and results from it. One field of interest I would think I am knowledgeable in is stock market trading. I would say the essence of it at the very core is about understanding supply and demand; it is driven by anticipation from analysis, and the excitement of risk taking. I would say this means people should approach it with passion since market analysis can be really boring for a good majority of people, and the ability to accept risk and losses as that is an inevitable part of this field. 
* Ti-A. 
* Q: What would you understand as an individual’s basic needs? Are these the same for everyone? To what extent do people rely on others to get their needs met? At what points does this become overreliance or underreliance? 
* A: I would say some core basic needs include certainty (stability, security), uncertainty (adventure, stimulants), connection (love, interaction), significance (attention, importance), growth, and contribution. I would say these do apply to every single person, but in what way they do and the magnitude of which they do differs. I think people rely on others to get their needs met to a large extent due to human’s social nature, and the social nature of our modern society. I think it becomes overreliance when they cannot meet their needs to a survivable extent intrinsically to the point where they do not function through temporary lows in life. I think it becomes underreliance when they completely try to cut out the social nature of mankind or even the humanity in life for whatever reason. 
* Ti-B. 
* Q: How do people gain leverage, power, and respect from others? Is it sometimes necessary to use threats, fear, and punishment to accomplish this? Why or why not? 
* A: I think people can gain leverage, power, and respect by showing to others what their intentions are and how these other people will benefit by working interdependently with people in question. I think it can be necessary to use threats, fear, or punishment to accomplish this when time is crucial and scarce and no better idea comes to mind, and the greatest priority of all is gaining authority to lead others to safety. However, this should always be a last resort and only be done if the reason to do so outweighs the unethicality by a very large amount to the point where it may be worth sacrificing a bit.
* Ti-C. 
* Q: One commonly used idiom is that “Everything has its place.” What does this mean to you? How do things being “in their place” contribute to orderliness? Do you agree with the idiom? Why or why not? 
* A: I agree with this statement. I do think that everything has its place and serves some purpose. The extent to which it serves its purpose and whether it is still relevant enough where its pros outweighs its cons is another matter, but I do think everything has at least some relevance.
* Ti-D. 
* Q: What makes hierarchies work? When are they appropriate to use, and what do they provide to people? Should they always strive for equality and justice? Why or why not? 
* A: I think hierarchies work when a division of power becomes a benefit so that followers and leaders are clear cut for maximum efficiency. I think it is appropriate to use them when there are multiple layers of people management and delegation. I think people should strive for equality and justice for the most part as I think everyone should have equal rights to do certain things such as voicing out opinions for a larger pool of opinions to evaluate certain decisions that affect everybody.
* Ti-E. 
* Q: What does it mean for something to be logical? Is this the norm? Provide an example of something logical and illogical, and compare what makes the first logical and the second not.
* A: I think for something to be logical means that it should agree with or explain something properly. It seems to differ from the dictionary definition of something following the rules of logic, but I think it’s still along the general same idea. An example of something logical would be to say that “The British citizens were upset by Dyson moving their HQ to Singapore as this is a betrayal to Dyson’s CEO saying that he has hopes for economic development in Britain”, and this makes sense since by moving his HQ to Singapore, he did essentially back up on his word of saying he was excited to see the economic developmental opportunities in Britain and not further developing in Britain, but in Singapore instead. An example of something illogical would be writing that “The British citizens were upset by Dyson moving their HQ to Singapore as this negatively affected the British Pound Sterling” when Dyson still pays similarly high taxes to Britain. The statement doesn’t agree with what is going on in the evidence. P.S. These examples came from my exam paper.
* Fi-A. 
* Q: What does it mean to be emotionally close to or distant from someone? In what ways can you adjust your “emotional distance” to someone else? For what reasons would you decide to do this? 
* A: I think to be emotionally close to someone would mean the 2 parties have a fairly comfortable relationship, and can share their emotions with each other with ease. I think you can adjust your emotional distance with someone with physical distance (how often you see them) and your emotional expressiveness (how much you express your true feelings to this person). You may decide to do this if you realise you clash with the other person often and when that happens, one of you or both of you get emotionally hurt, and thus you would adjust your emotional distance to reduce how often or if you even will get hurt by each other.
* Fi-B. 
* Q: Share some thoughts on how you view love and desire. What makes a person desirable? Is this the norm? Are some people more deserving of these than others? Why or why not? 
* A: I am not too well versed in this topic, I’ve really only understood love as a perceptive feeling and desire a measure of how much you want something or someone. A person can be desirable for how attractive their appearance is, or how well they can emotionally connect with you. I don’t know. I think everyone should have equal rights to desire, but some people may need to better learn to control how they release the energy of desire.
* Fi-C. 
* Q: Describe what morality means to you. What does it mean for something or someone to be good or bad? What does it take for something bad to become good? Are some things truly irredeemable? Why or why not? 
* A: It is the distinction and weighing between right and wrong. I think for something to be good or bad it depends on who it affects; if you steal from a bank, you affect a business and then a society. And since it negatively affects all of the people involved, it is bad. If you help someone earn money, it is generally good since you are helping someone increase their buying power to do more good things. However, if in the process of helping that someone you earn the money through criminal activity, such as scamming people, then it becomes bad because you negatively affected the people who had been scammed.
* Fi-D. 
* Q: How are people shaped by their relationships with their friends and family? How do these differ from romantic ones? Are non-romantic relationships more important than romantic ones? Why or why not? 
* A: I think relationships with friends and family can shape one’s perspectives, moral compass, value system, and even life goals. I think these relationships differ from romantic ones based on the people involved and the level of intimacy. I tink non-romantic relationships and romantic relationships hold the same level of importance, but I think it is just how they contribute to someone’s life that they differ. I don’t really have a further explanation for this one.
* Fi-E. 
* Q: What can establishing new relationships with people do for someone? Is making new contacts with others as important as deepening the ones people already have? Why or why not?
* A: I think it can increase your view of perspectives and knowledge to eventually lead you to an increasingly more accurate view and understanding of life. I think making new contacts with others and deepening the ones people already have are equally important, and better done simultaneously if possible, but generally done based on which is more convenient. Making new contacts broadens our perspectives and knowledge, while deepening our contacts we already have deepens our understanding on a more nuanced level.
* Si-A. 
* Q; One of the key themes in the bestselling book Atomic Habits is that what people have in their surrounding environment is the greatest subconscious driver of how they live their life. Do you agree? Why or why not? How can changing the environment around someone impact the way they live their life? 
* A: Yes. I think whether we realise it or not, everything around us is perceived by the brain consciously or subconsciously. To what extent it is perceived and therefore impacts, however, is another matter. Changing an environment can change the vibe someone might feel, thus affecting their mood, thus affecting the decisions they make.
* Si-B. 
* Q: How should people approach managing their health and well-being? How does this compare to the way you approach your own? When should people be taking their health and well-being into account? Why? 
* A: I would say it is about making decisions that offer them the most opportunities at achieving goals and therefore happiness in their lives. This is what I live by to a small extent, but nonetheless the only thing I think of; I’m otherwise chasing substanceless stimulants that have absolutely no benefit. 
* Si-C. 
* Q: Think about the way sensations, both good and bad, shape the way people live and experience their lives. How important are experiencing good sensations in one’s life? Is there a limit to how much one should chase these? What role do negative sensations play in our lives?
* A: I think experiencing good sensations is important to let us know what we should do more of. I think there is a limit to how much these should be chased, and though I don’t know how it should be measured, I would say the reason is simply that everything that goes up must come down and vice versa. Good and bad experiences are 2 sides of the same coin that must exist in a balance to exist at all. Too many good experiences and nothing is comparatively good; too many bad experiences and nothing is comparatively bad. Negative sensations should let us know what we should avoid.
*  
* Si-D. 
* Q: Choose one of the following: art, clothing, photography, graphic design. What makes something well-designed in that area? How do the individual components work together to generate the experience? 
* A: I will be completely honest, my view is that these are all subjective and there is no way to really measure how good these are other than measuring other people’s opinions. Thus, I never had a personal opinion on any of these.
* Si-E. 
* Q: Describe what your living & working environments are like. How do they affect you? Would other people be similarly affected in the same environment? Why or why not? What changes could you make to improve it? How would these be beneficial?
* A: I would say they are quite messy, and I generally prefer knowing things should where I instinctively could have left them than to think that something should be there because it is organised a certain way. I wouldn’t say it affects me, I just can’t be bothered to put everything in a specific way. I don’t know how others would be similarly affected, they might feel it’s way too cluttered? I wouldn’t have thought of any changes to improve it either.
* Ni-A. 
* Q: How do people’s relationship to the past, present, and future influence the way they currently live their lives? To what extent does this affect them? How does this influence your own life? 
* A: I think it can shape how people will anticipate the future based on what has happened before and could potentially happen again just due to natural laws. This may give them insight to what they might want to prepare for, but it can also cause tunnel vision. I would say it is great to be able to think of what could happen based on the choices I make to better understand what can result of the choices I make before I make them.
* Ni-B. 
* Q: What does it mean for a person to be at a certain “phase” of their life? What puts people into the phases they’re currently in? How does this affect the way people navigate their lives? 
* A: I think to be in a phase means to embrace a certain mindset or way of doing or thinking for a certain period of time. I think people may be put into phases because of environmental changes, or changes in perspective. This may affect how people navigate their lives because they are under a different mindset; essentially the decisions they make come from a different base.
* Ni-C. 
* Q: How do you anticipate events unfolding? How can you observe them unfolding in your environment? How do you adjust yourself towards the way things are developing? Provide some examples. 
* A: You can anticipate events unfolding by understanding what can happen based on what has happened before, understanding the circumstance that you are in right now, the factors at play, and running the simulation in your head with the same logic (abstracted or inferred). I would adjust myself based on what would then theoretically allow me to reap the best result. I don’t really have a concrete example, I just remember going through this process multiple times in my life. I have this same issue of knowing things happened but not the concrete example for most things.
* Ni-D. 
* Q: Think about the way you experience the pace and rhythm of your life. What dictates the speed in which time flies? Why do you think people experience time passing at different rates? 
* A: I think the thing that affects my perception of the speed of time is how sensorily close we are to reality. If I am fully trying to take in the experience of sitting in class, surrounded by these specific people, seeing every movement everybody is making, time will obviously pass by slower (perceptive time : reality time ratio is \~1:1). If I am processing or running simulations, time passes by faster as I am experiencing time at a slower rate than reality, and reality is passing by time at a faster rate than I am experiencing in my head (perceptive time : reality time ratio is \[<1\]:1. Thus for every 1 second of time, I am experiencing less than 1 second of time perceptively. Thus in an 1 hour, I have only really perceived maybe 40min? So while I have only perceived 40min of my perceptive life, my physical life has already travelled an hour; my physical life is going by 50% percent faster than I had perceived time to be). Furthermore with this, I think I can only perceive time to pass by slower than it really is, and my total perceived time will always feel like less than my physically lived time. I could very well have only experienced 30 years of life in an 80 year lifespan.
* Ni-E. 
* Q: Consider each of the following feelings people have about time: hurriedness, anxiety, optimism/pessimism. What causes people to experience these feelings? What role do they play in our lives? To what extent are these feelings beneficial?
* A: I think people may experience these feelings really just due to what metric they use to perceive as a good or bad passing of time. If you think time passing  by faster is better, such as in a boring class, then the faster feeling of time definitely leads to optimism. If you think time is passing by too fast, such as the time available to study for an exam, you would feel that there is not enough time, leading to you feeling hurried or anxious.",1,1747828840.0,mbti,0,1.0,False

[Link to the article](https://investx.fr/en/crypto-news/top-3-memecoins-bonk-popcat-kendu/)

Recently, $KENDU has been mentioned in this article besides two big names in the memecoin scene:

* $BONK: $423 million market cap
* $POPCAT: $1.7 billion market cap

If you compare these marketcaps with $KENDU, which is sitting at $32 million as we speak, KENDU has a lot of upwards potential! In June 2024, $KENDU reach its all time high of $286 million marketcap. From the levels we are at right now, that is a solid +700%. I'd say open your agenda and look at the date, next month is June.. 👀

**This is what Gaston wrote down about $KENDU:**

>**KENDU** has emerged as one of the top-performing memecoins this week, showing an impressive **99%** increase, although the pace has slightly slowed over the past 24 hours. Holderscan data shows that over 68% of **KENDU** holders own more than $10 worth of tokens, reflecting strong investor confidence in the future potential of this token.

>If KENDU manages to secure **$0.00003063** as support, it could leverage the positive market signals to surpass **$0.00004246**, or even reach **$0.00005042**. However, if selling pressure outweighs the bullish sentiment, a drop below **$0.00003063** could lead to a decline to **$0.00001919**. Such a development would challenge the positive outlook and indicate further **downside potential** for KENDU.

There is a reason Gaston mentioned KENDU, the community is putting in real work! Let me give you a few examples.

**Kendu Games: AAA Dev Comes Out of Retirement**

This is the biggest news. [Coop](https://x.com/WhatDidCoopSay), a community member, is now launching a legitimate game studio under the $KENDU umbrella, named; Kendu Games. Not a half-baked crypto game or a easy cash-grab. A full-scale traditional RPG, with serious developers. The lead dev? A former triple AAA game developer and BioWare veteran who worked on Dragon Age, Mass Effect, and Baldur’s Gate. He literally came out of retirement for this, purely because he believes in what Kendu is doing. The plan is to create a Skyrim-style RPG, followed by a roguelite later. No crypto gimmicks in the gameplay. But the kicker is that game profits will be used to buy Kendu tokens and fund the community. Here's a small breakdown, from all the profits 10% will go into a Kendu Games Business treasury and 5% will be donated to the Kendu Community wallet. let's say they hit one million copies sold, which is likely to happen, that’s an estimated $1.6 million in buy pressure for Kendu. That’s just from one game.

[Kendu Games X Profile](https://x.com/KenduGames)

[KENDU Games Teaser](https://reddit.com/link/1krvy1c/video/lcqty5t5j42f1/player)

**Decentralized Brand, Real-World Impact**

Kendu isn’t just building in digital spaces. The brand is exploding in the real world too. Members of the community have launched Kendu Coffee, Kendu Energy Drinks, Kendu Vodka, Kendu Nights (club promotions), and even Kendu Esports, a League of Legends team. What makes this different from every other project? It’s all permissionless. Anyone can build under the Kendu brand without needing to ask for approval. There is no centralized entity handing out licenses. This is decentralized brand ownership in action.

[Kendu Energy Promo Video](https://reddit.com/link/1krvy1c/video/tnnlm7y7j42f1/player)

**""We Don’t Gamble, We Work""**

This has become the core philosophy of Kendu. The project isn’t about flipping tokens or hoping for pumps. It’s about showing up and putting in the work. Token holders treat Kendu like a startup. There are daily goals, power hours, and people grinding social content and launching real-life products. The Kendu community is working, not speculating.

**No Paid Hype, No Insiders**

One of the most refreshing parts of Kendu is how it’s grown. There are no paid influencers, no whales with insider allocations, and no VC dumping risk. Everyone buys with their own money. Everyone contributes with their own effort. It’s raw, organic, and surprisingly effective. The project has reached over 18,000 holders this way. Not through hype, but through work.

**Wormhole Bridge: Building for the Long Game**

Kendu has also quietly launched bridges to the Solana and Base chains. This wasn’t a PR stunt or hype strategy. It was a tactical move, preparing for the moment when momentum returns. The goal is simple: dominate the top gainers list across multiple chains in the long term. This kind of forward-thinking infrastructure sets Kendu apart from typical meme coins. And the cool addition to this; let's say Solana moves up in price? This will automatically drive the price of $KENDU without any added buy pressure.

[$KENDU Available on 3 Chains](https://preview.redd.it/5e6wfzpaj42f1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ade0188d24ebd8d9fcc97aa3c9d8e04f608246bc)

**TL;DR**

$KENDU was recently mentioned alongside big names like $BONK and $POPCAT, but its market cap is still much smaller, a very high ROI from these levels. A former AAA game developer is making a full RPG for Kendu, and profits from the game will be used to buy KENDU tokens. The community is also creating real products like Kendu Coffee and Energy Drinks. There are no paid influencers or big investors, just people working hard together. Bullish on $KENDU.

1krvwyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/loneliness/comments/1krvwyn/why_was_i_never_able_to_make_close_friendships/,Why was I never able to make close friendships?,"As the title says, I’ve never been able to make close friends, and I don’t really know why. It all started when I began going through puberty I couldn’t connect with other kids at all. At that time, I spent a lot of time in online communities, mostly with much older people, and formed some very deep connections. However, I ruined most of them after a few months because I became too emotionally intense for the other person, which I now regret and try to avoid.

In the last two years of high school, I had three friends whom I loved deeply, but it still felt like I couldn’t share certain parts of myself. As a result, those relationships never reached the depth I longed for, depth I had experienced with some of my internet friends. Since starting university, things have gotten significantly worse. I've only had fleeting, surface-level friendships.

Two and a half years ago, I met my ex-partner. They were the only person I’ve ever felt I could truly be myself with. You could say they were the only close friend I’ve ever had. However, we broke up a few months ago, and now I feel like I’m back at square one.

What baffles me is that I’ve become a pretty outgoing person, especially starting in the last two years of high school. At university, I began going to a lot of community events, used apps like Bumble BFF, and was never afraid to talk to people. This helped me make quite a few superficial connections, e.g. people I might see every few months for coffee or only within the context we met (a book club for example). But despite trying as hard as I could, none of these connections developed into anything deeper.

I just want the kind of friendship where someone invites you to their birthday, where you can plan a trip together, things like that. The problem is either that I simply don’t vibe with the other person in that way, or, more often, that the other person just doesn’t have the capacity to let new people into their life. If a connection does start to deepen, it’s rarely reciprocal. I’m the one initiating everything we do.

I tried therapy for a year and a half while I was in the relationship with my ex-partner, but because I was generally feeling well during that time, my therapist didn’t find much to work on. After the breakup I was hospitalized in the psychiatry and I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. That might be contributing to the problem. But for the past few years, I haven’t exhibited the most problematic traits that typically affect friendships (lashing out over small things, cutting people off impulsively, intense oversharing).

I’ve also wondered if I might be autistic. I don’t show many of the typical symptoms, apart from struggling to form close friendships, having niche interests, preferring one-on-one conversations over parties, and mostly having autistic friends. That said, none of my autistic friends seem to have the same difficulty making and maintaining friendships that I do.

Does anyone have any ideas about why I might be struggling so much to make close friends? Or tips on how to either cope with this or find the kinds of meaningful connections desperately want?",1,1747828438.0,loneliness,0,1.0,False
1krvwru,https://www.reddit.com/r/pppdizziness/comments/1krvwru/mitolyn_reviews_and_complaints_used_it_daily_an/,MITOLYN Reviews and ComplaintS:~ (Used it Daily) An Honest Customer 2025 Review!,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my experience with a supplement I started taking about two months ago – it’s called MITOLYN, and honestly, I think it deserves more attention. I’ve seen some scattered posts about it but not many deep dives, so here’s a full review based on my real usage. Hopefully, this helps if you’re considering it.

🌟 What is MITOLYN?
MITOLYN is marketed as a mitochondrial support supplement designed to boost cellular energy, mental clarity, and overall vitality. The key focus is enhancing mitochondrial health, which is critical because mitochondria are like your cells’ power plants. As we age (or if we deal with stress, poor diet, or chronic fatigue), our mitochondria can take a hit — leading to low energy, brain fog, and even mood swings.

MITOLYN claims to reverse some of that damage by supporting mitochondrial repair and function using a blend of natural ingredients.

🔍 Why I Tried MITOLYN
I’ve always struggled with low energy in the afternoons. I’m not into energy drinks or stimulants, and coffee started giving me anxiety. I wanted something natural that supports my body without just slapping on a temporary fix.

After doing some research, I came across MITOLYN, and what caught my eye was that it targets the root cause of fatigue: poor mitochondrial function.

The reviews I found were mostly positive, and I liked that the formula was backed by real science — so I figured why not?

🧪 What’s Inside MITOLYN? (And Why It Matters)
Here’s a breakdown of the key ingredients in MITOLYN and what they do:

CoQ10 – A powerhouse antioxidant that helps the mitochondria generate energy (ATP).

PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone) – Supports the growth of new mitochondria and protects existing ones from oxidative stress.

Acetyl-L-Carnitine – A proven amino acid for mental clarity, energy, and fat metabolism.

Alpha Lipoic Acid – A dual-action antioxidant that works in both fat- and water-soluble environments. Also helps recycle other antioxidants.

Magnesium & B-Vitamins – These are crucial co-factors in the mitochondrial energy production cycle.

Rhodiola Rosea & NAD+ precursors – Help the body adapt to stress and improve endurance and energy at the cellular level.

This combination felt like a smart, synergistic formula, and I appreciated that there were no fillers or weird artificial ingredients.

🧠 My Results After 60 Days
So, here’s the good stuff — what I personally experienced after using MITOLYN consistently for two months.

✅ Week 1-2:
Didn’t notice much initially (as expected — it’s not a caffeine pill).

Slight increase in morning alertness.

Felt less drained at the end of workdays.

✅ Week 3-4:
Big difference in mental clarity — I wasn’t zoning out at 3 PM anymore.

No more brain fog when switching between tasks.

Even noticed a lift in my mood – less irritability and more balanced energy.

✅ Week 5-6:
Waking up felt easier – I didn’t need to hit snooze three times.

I started working out more because I had more natural energy.

Even my skin looked better, possibly due to the antioxidant benefits (though that wasn’t my goal).

🙌 What I Liked Most
No crashes or jitters – it’s not stimulant-based, so energy is more stable.

Clean label – no shady proprietary blends, just pure ingredients.

Easy to take – I just took two capsules in the morning with breakfast.

Noticeable improvements in focus, productivity, and mood.

🤔 What Could Be Better?
It’s a little on the pricey side — but IMO worth it considering the quality.

Not a “quick fix” – it takes a couple of weeks to really kick in.

Only available online (at least at the time I bought it).

📈 Is MITOLYN Worth It?
For me, absolutely yes.

If you deal with low energy, burnout, or brain fog and want a natural, long-term solution, MITOLYN is seriously worth trying. It’s not a miracle overnight cure, but over time, it builds up your body’s ability to create sustainable energy from within — which is kind of the whole point.

I’m not affiliated with the company or anything — just a happy customer who feels better than I have in years. My productivity has gone up, I’m more motivated to move my body, and I’m not crashing mid-afternoon anymore. That’s a huge win in my book.

🔁 Final Thoughts
MITOLYN isn’t hype — it’s legit science-backed support for your body’s energy systems. It helped me turn the corner on a cycle of fatigue and brain fog, and I’ve already recommended it to a few friends who love it too.",1,1747828421.0,pppdizziness,0,1.0,False

My husband never woke up to help.  
Not once.  
He would just say stuff like “you’re so good with her” and roll over.  
I wanted to scream.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — The world's sources of critical minerals are increasingly concentrated in just a few countries, most notably China, leaving the global economy vulnerable to supply cutoffs that could disrupt industry and hit consumers with higher prices, a report said Wednesday.

The Paris-based International Energy Agency's report looked at the availability of minerals and metals that may be small in quantity — but large in impact when it comes to shifting the economy away from fossil fuels toward electricity and renewable energy.

It found that for copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earth elements, the average market share of the three top producing countries rose to 86% in 2024 from 82% in 2020.

China is the leading refiner for 19 out of 20 strategic minerals studied in the report, and has an average share of around 75%. Indonesia showed strong growth in nickel, a key component in making steel and batteries for electric vehicles.

The current trend toward export restrictions and trade disputes increases concerns, the IEA said.

“Critical mineral supply chains can be highly vulnerable to supply shocks, be they from extreme weather, a technical failure or trade disruptions,” said IEA executive director Fatih Birol. ”The impact of a supply shock can be far-reaching, bringing higher prices for consumers and reducing industrial competitiveness.”

Birol cited the energy crisis in Europe after Russia cut off natural gas supplies over the invasion of Ukraine. Another cautionary tale is the global shortage of silicon-based computer chips during and after the pandemic, which disrupted auto production.

“The golden rule of energy security is diversification,” Birol told The Associated Press in an interview. “And it goes beyond energy security, it is also economic security.""

Market forces are important in developing new sources but won't be enough. “There is a need for well-designed government policies” in the form of financing and other measures, he said.""

[China has placed export limits](https://apnews.com/article/china-us-gallium-critical-tech-ban-711fdfcb7c09e0e0e6374192fd2e24fa) of many of these key products and tightened controls on others as President Donald Trump’s trade negotiations escalate, stifling U.S. industry and the nation’s ability to find quick alternatives.

The IEA report said that global markets were well supplied at the moment and that prices in general have fallen. It warned however that planned production of copper, which is essential for electric wiring and power grids, would not keep pace with demand and predicted a 30% shortfall by 2030.

# MAY 21st, 2025~Trump’s ‘Golden Dome’: What to Know

[Trump’s ‘Golden Dome’: What to Know](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/trump-s-golden-dome-what-to-know/ar-AA1FbzXJ?ocid=BingNewsSerp)

[resident Trump in front of a poster illustrating his proposed ‘Golden Dome’ in the Oval Office on May 20, 2025](https://preview.redd.it/4v9g97god42f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb179f6c64ad0ad11364855e48fedb573e267c6f)

Donald Trump is moving forward with an ambitious and expensive national missile defense system, saying Tuesday that he aims to get it up and running before the end of his term.

Alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Space Force Vice Chief of Operations Gen. Michael Guetlein, the President announced the so-called “Golden Dome”—a defense system of missiles, satellites, and sensors named after his [favorite color](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-07-22/donald-trump-loves-gold-and-don-t-you-forget-it) and akin to Israel’s “Iron Dome,” which the U.S. has in large part funded. Trump tasked Guetlein with spearheading the new project.

If completed as planned, the “Golden Dome” would mark the first time the U.S. puts weapons in space.

Trump, who [promised](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4657978-trump-iron-dome-israel/) an Iron Dome for America on the campaign trail, is not the first President to propose such a defense system. Ronald Reagan proposed a space-centric [Strategic Defense Initiative](https://time.com/archive/6685651/star-wars-at-the-crossroads/) (nicknamed “Star Wars”) in 1983, though it never materialized due to financial, political, and technological constraints.

“Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world, and even if they're launched from space,” Trump said. “We will truly be completing the job that President Reagan started 40 years ago, forever ending the missile threat to the American homeland.”

Here’s what to know.

# What would the Golden Dome look like?

While flanked by posters depicting a literal dome around the U.S., Trump provided few details for the exact structure of his proposed “Golden Dome,” though it is clear that it is envisioned as a constellation of on-ground and space-based sensors and missile-interceptors. 

Hegseth said the system will protect the U.S. from “cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, hypersonic missiles, drones, whether they're conventional or nuclear.” The system, according to an [order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/the-iron-dome-for-america/) outlining the President’s expectations back in January, is expected to intercept missiles during any of four stages of an attack: before launch, early flight, midcourse flight, and descent towards a target.

# Who will build the Golden Dome?

[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/musks-spacex-is-frontrunner-build-trumps-golden-dome-missile-shield-2025-04-17/) reported in April that SpaceX, the company helmed by Trump ally Elon Musk, in collaboration with software firm Palantir and drone manufacturer Anduril was among the frontrunners to be contracted to develop the “Golden Dome.” Citing unnamed sources, the three firms reportedly met with top officials in the Trump Administration and the Pentagon in recent weeks to propose a plan to build and launch from 400 to over 1,000 satellites around the globe to detect and track missiles. The report added that more than 180 companies have expressed interest in developing and building the “Golden Dome.” 

The [Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/golden-dome-missile-defense-trump-space-e74d637feac06edcfde79214d8acf179) reported that the Pentagon, after Trump’s January order, has studied options for the program, tiered by cost and scale based on how many satellites, sensors, and space-based interceptors would be purchased. The AP [initially reported](https://web.archive.org/web/20250520165649/https://apnews.com/article/golden-dome-missile-defense-trump-space-e74d637feac06edcfde79214d8acf179) that the Trump Administration had chosen a mid-tier option.

# How much would the Golden Dome cost? 

A “Golden Dome” will likely require significantly more resources than Israel’s Iron Dome—which the nonpartisan [Center for Strategic and International Studies](https://missilethreat.csis.org/defsys/iron-dome/) estimated cost about $100 million per battery to produce and has 10 batteries—as the U.S. is more than 400 times larger than Israel, which is about the size of New Jersey.

Trump, in his announcement, said the project would cost $175 billion over the next three years, with $25 billion earmarked in his tax spending megabill for the initial costs. The nonpartisan [Congressional Budget Office](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61237) said earlier this month that the overall cost of a space-based interceptor system could depend on launch costs, which may vary in the future. The CBO estimated that the total cost of deploying and operating such a system, over 20 years, could range from $161 billion to $831 billion in 2025 dollars.

# What are other concerns about the Golden Dome?

The proposal has faced considerable opposition from lawmakers and analysts over various issues from costs to capacity.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D, Mass.) and Rep. Greg Casar (D, Texas) have led a group of 42 members of Congress [urging an investigation](https://casar.house.gov/media/press-releases/news-congressman-casar-senator-warren-lead-call-inspector-general-review-musk) into the project’s awarding process, including Musk’s reported involvement.

In a [May 13 congressional hearing](https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/5132025strategicforcestranscript1.pdf), Sen. Angus King (I, Maine) also questioned defense officials about the Dome’s capability to thwart attacks, asking if such a system “could deny a substantial missile attack from Russia or China.”

Even Republican Senator Tim Sheehy of Montana [reportedly](https://spacenews.com/senate-forms-golden-dome-caucus-to-champion-missile-defense-shield/) flagged that the cost of building such a system would be in the “trillions.”

Critics of the “Golden Dome” have also raised concerns about [spurring an arms race](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2025/05/golden-dome-missile-russia?lang=en), pushing military adversaries like Russia and China to develop their arsenal to maintain credible deterrence. 

# When asked about criticisms of the proposal, Trump simply said, “Well, they're wrong. It’s about as close to perfect as you can have in terms of real production.”

1krvozh,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1krvozh/case_study_that_makes_no_sense/,Case Study (that makes no sense),"\*\*Let me begin by saying that due to the events I am about to describe, and because my friends know my normal reddit account, I will need to use a throwaway. The information I am giving here is, to say the least, shameful and embarrassing, and I have since removed any and all people that I used to have contact with during these times. The story below explains my experience from 2009 to 2010 and I am looking for some scientific explanation as to how this happened. I am only including these details to explain the case study example, not to focus on me specifically, but I am providing the information for a clearer picture. Also I am not sure where else to post this question to fit better with the nature of the subreddit as it surely seems people find it loaded? Either way, here goes.

I used to be a dirt poor student, in a city I hated very far from my parents and friends, with active depression and manic episodes. I also had undiagnosed PCOS and was in an extremely abusive relationship that would have led to me being pregnant and baby-trapped if not for the PCOS side effect of weak fertility. At the time, I was also abusing nicotine (2 packs a day) and over-consuming black coffee (8 cups per day).

Long story short, my abusive boyfriend got mad and called me a fat fuck one day, and for once in his life he was right. I was well above 190lbs with a 5'5 body. Therefore, and since he would not allow me to go to the gym, I started with diet and walking. Here is where the issue began.

Once I started eating what I thought at the time was right, I started gaining weight rapidly. I would wake up bloated, nauseous and with raging headaches. This led me to start tracking calories and minimizing my food sources as I thought I maybe had some sensitivities or allergies. I also began walking 20k steps a day, cause one of my tiny acquaintances told me this is how she stays thin.

During the mornings I had classes, and during the afternoons I tutored other students just to be able to get some income and pay rent, which left me with the only option to eat at night and then go for my 2hour walk. Since it was already late and I was jittery from caffeine, I didn't have it in me to cook extensive healthy recipes. Therefore, the only logical solution for me back then was a full pack of leafy greens salad (you know the ones, pre-packaged in the super market) with 2 boiled eggs, no salt, no oil, no butter etc etc. If I was feeling extra feisty, I would also eat one slice of deli turkey with this combo. And then I left for my nightly 2 hour walk.

As you can imagine, and aside from the fact that I was smoking like a factory, I was constantly tired but also hyper due to the coffee. Which had me believe that if I didn't sleep at all, and if I walked throughout the night I would lose more calories and the scale would go down. Problem was the scale wasn't going down, it was going up; and it did so in weird ways.

I would wake up with just 2 hours of sleep and I would be well over 10lbs. In just one day of eating less than 1000 calories. I would then not sleep and walk throughout the night for multiple days and by the end of the week I was almost 230lbs.

Now I can understand that exhaustion leads to water retention and that bodies need to not feel like they are starving in order to lose weight, but I wasn't being passive. I was constantly moving (in a pretty clear-cut manic episode vibe, as I can realize now) and I was eating less than 1000 calories per day. Scientifically, to me, it makes no sense. If anything I should have looked like a Victorian child one step away from their final breath, but here I was looking plump and jiggly like never before. I never lost any weight during this attempt and I managed to keep this manic-power-walking up for close to 10 months. Where I ended up with 260lbs.

I had started to lose hope long before I reached the 260lbs, so I visited the on-site school doctor. He was mortified with my practices and it showed. I had started losing hair and had not seen a drop of my period for months. He referred me to the school therapist and hooked me up with a good OBGYN who then prescribed metformin. I got my period back in a month, and started dropping weight like nobody's business.

I got therapy. I managed my depressive episodes. I finished my degree and had to move in with my grandparents, so I also dropped the abusive boyfriend. Life started feeling like life again.

I will be on metformin for life, due to my insulin resistance that comes with PCOS, and I am currently trying to get pregnant with my husband. Life is great and I am down to a healthy weight of 150lbs. I am eating fruits and veggies and meat. So much meat, honestly, I love meat.

But scientifically, it still makes no sense. It makes no sense how counting calories and minimizing food didn't work. I also wonder where did the extra weight come from? Bodies need fuel to store fat, but I gave it zero fuel for months. I was living of fumes and good faith. How do people become anorexic? Why didn't it happen to me? All the doctor I ever asked about this ungodly manic period of my life told me I was counting wrong. But how wrong can you count one pack of salad and 2 boiled eggs? This was my single meal per day for months. I should have simply starved, and yet I didn't. How do people manage to enter that anorectic state we see where bones protrude and the skin is hanging on by threads, if not by eating one salad and two boiled eggs?

If anyone can explain the science behind it all I would be very much obliged. So far, people have not come up with any explanations besides the calorie tracking was off.

The past few years have shined a dazzling, uncomfortable spotlight on the delicate ballet that gets food from farm to fork. Climate-fueled supply disruptions, skyrocketing produce spoilage, and mounting pressure for ethical transparency have bruised even the mightiest food giants and thrown up billion-dollar opportunities for those bold enough to solve.

According to the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/08/food-supply-chain-networks-why-sustainable-practices-fail-and-approaches-to-improve-them/), the food industry is at a global market value of around $9.12 trillion, expanding steadily at 6.7% annually. This is the moment the supply chain becomes sexy. If you want opportunities where demand isn’t waning any time soon, food supply chains are screaming for your attention.

# Problem 1: Food Supply Chain Resilience to Climate Events

Remember when a heatwave in Spain torpedoed tomato harvests and drove European prices through the roof? Now multiply that by the severity and frequency of climate events we’re seeing globally. From California droughts to Southeast Asian floods, the food network is always a storm away from chaos.

Yet most supply chains remain alarmingly brittle, built around historic predictability. They falter when battered by unpredictable weather. But hey, what if these networks could anticipate a heatwave, reroute shipments, or draw on alternative suppliers before disaster strikes?

Meet ClimAdapt: A spark of hope. This platform brings AI, real-time climate feeds, and advanced modeling smack into the hands of supply chain managers. It predicts disruptions before there’s panic and choreographs responses to keep shelves stocked and systems sane. Resilience isn’t about luck; it’s about smart, timely moves.

# Problem 2: Optimizing Cold Chain Logistics for Fresh Produce

Globally, roughly a third of all food produced is lost or wasted, with much of that spoilage striking during the trip from field to table. Fresh produce has it worst—lettuce wilts, avocados rot, and strawberries sweat out shelf life at the faintest whiff of temperature fluctuation. Traditionally, most cold chains rely on patchy logbooks or clunky sensors that yell after the damage is done.

Now picture this: A web of clever IoT sensors pooling their temperature whispers into a dashboard that alerts carriers instantly if produce is about to suffer. Not just warnings, but dynamic controls. This platform empowers shippers to instantly fix issues, ride out power blips, and course-correct logistics mid-route. The spoilage math flips; suppliers save millions, supermarkets stay happy, customers bite into literally fresher fruits.

# Problem 3: Transparency and Traceability in Emerging Markets

>

Today's consumers (and regulators) are suspicious, demanding, and ever more educated. Emerging markets are the source of some of the world’s most coveted foods, but they remain shadowy when it comes to certifiable transparency.

Unscrupulous actors, supply chain gunk, and limited digital tools make it tricky for retailers to assure shoppers that their quinoa, coffee, or spices are what they say they are.

Imagine a startup, let’s call it ClearChain, that uses blockchain and mobile tech to stamp every mango, bean, or nut with an end-to-end supply story. Every handler, every cold room, every border crossed, visible and immutable. From farmer to grocer, the chain transforms from foggy to crystal-clear. This is compliance and consumer confidence as a service.

>

Don’t let this one slip past! Transparency is poised to be the hot ticket in food.

Supply chains don't wait; the next crisis could be tomorrow, and the next unicorn might start with a patch of wilted lettuce or a storm on the horizon. The talent gap is real, and hungry investors are circling.

Hesitate and you’ll end up eating leftovers while the quick thinkers feast on fresh opportunity.

*Let's build.*

Tarja Turunen performs at the Rockharz Festival, at the same time the Sauna Water Marathon is taking place in the region - Jana and Inken combine sauna and music in an interview with Tarja Turunen.

by SusanneT, 25.08.2022 

On the occasion of the Sauna Water Marathon, Jana Stegbauer from the German Research Foundation (DFG) Saxony-Anhalt and Inken Paletta from the German Research Foundation (DFG) Hesse had the opportunity to conduct a fascinating interview with Tarja Turunen on the topic of ""Sauna meets Music"" in the run-up to the ROCKHARZ Open Air in Ballenstedt. The Sauna Water Marathon is a joint project of the German-Finnish Society (Deutsch-Finnisch Gesellschaft eV) and the Finnish Institute in Berlin. As part of the event, a sauna bucket and, representing it, a bottle filled with pure water will travel from Lake Pyhäjärvi near Tampere to the International Sauna Congress , which will take place in Stuttgart in October. There are many great sauna events to discover along the route; perhaps there's one for you!

Inca:
Moikka Tarja, nice to meet you, and nice of you to take the time to talk to us about the sauna and its influence on your music before your live gig at ROCKHARZ Open Air in Ballenstedt. But before we get to the topic of saunas, we'd like to know: What's it like for you to be playing live in front of so many fans again after such a long ""coronavirus break""?

Tarja Turunen:
That's a really great feeling! It's just wonderful to see all the people so happy to finally be able to hear live music again. It's also fantastic for me to feel the concentrated energy of the audience. As a musician, you enjoy working in the studio because it's fun to record new songs, but you especially love being on stage! The stage is like a second home to me. That's why I really missed live performances during the coronavirus pandemic. Now I feel like I can finally breathe and be free again! All those feelings of happiness are returning! Simply wonderful!

Jana:
What do you particularly like about big festival appearances like ROCKHARZ?

Tarja Turunen:
It's simply fantastic to perform at big festivals and in front of such a large audience. However, it's always a challenge to present your own music at festivals, and that doesn't just apply to me, but to all the other musicians too. People at these festivals usually come to see lots of bands, not just one. So not everyone knows your music. Lots of people like your songs, but some don't. But I still love these big festivals. As I mentioned, it's the energy of the audience that I like so much. It motivates me to keep doing my work. And ultimately, it creates a sense of community. For me as an artist, communication between me and the audience at every concert is incredibly important. Sometimes I even recognize a few of my fans in the audience if they make it to the front row. It's just nice to see who's all there.

Inken:
Do you think there is a difference between German and Finnish fans?

Tarja Turunen:
Every country is a little different. There are cultural differences between people. Even in Finland, it depends a little on where exactly you're performing. Still, I think we Finns are, in a way, a little more reserved when it comes to showing our emotions. Still, when you go to a rock concert in Finland, you see happy and cheering Finns welcoming the bands. And in Germany, too, the fans have always been great. They've welcomed me with open arms every time, and that's been the case since 1997, so for a very long time. Also, the German fans gave me the opportunity to play more than just rock music. That's how I got around Germany a lot, and I also had the chance to live there for a few years. I really enjoyed that. So, people all over the world are very different. As an artist, I travel a lot and see these differences, but that's what I like so much.

Yesterday:
The next question concerns your music. Is there a song from your ROCKHARZ setlist that you particularly like, or to put it another way, is there a song that has a special meaning for you?

Tarja Turunen:
Oh, that's a very difficult question. They're my songs, and I like them all. But the first song of my solo career was ""I Walk Alone."" I'd say that was the song that put me on the map as a solo artist. I love that song, especially because it connects me with my fans. In a way, the song is about my fans, but it's also about me and my work as a musician, as well as the motivation to kick myself in the butt every day and keep going. I like singing that song because every time I sing it, I feel a strong connection with my fans. The song is a love letter, so to speak, to music, but also to my fans.

Inca:
You make a variety of music, including symphonic metal and rock, and you're also active in classical music. What do you like so much about these different musical genres, and what opportunities does combining different musical styles offer you as an artist?

Tarja Turunen:
Yes, I've been switching between musical genres—rock and classical music—for a long time. It all started with classical music, so it's very important for me to continue with it. Classical music gave me a kind of foundation for my current career as a singer and musician. It keeps me and my voice in shape and contributes to my voice's continuous development. Rock music, on the other hand, gives me the freedom to express myself, to have fun, and sometimes to be a little wild. (smiles) Because in rock music, there are no boundaries. Perhaps you think the two musical styles are very different, but for me, or let's say deep down inside, they are united. They complete me as an artist. Of course, it took me many years to learn how to sing rock songs with my classically trained voice. I had to find my own way. That was quite a challenge for me. I took singing lessons, which I still do today, whenever necessary. Because it's important to me to always work on my voice. I love switching between both musical genres. It's so much fun to perform at major festivals like ROCKHARZ or Wacken Open Air and then, a few days later, play classical pieces by Schubert or Schumann in front of a symphony orchestra. For me as an artist, that's always a great challenge! I love challenges and tend to embrace them with great enthusiasm whenever they arise. (smiles)

Yesterday:
Now we come to the sauna questions. Do you also go to the sauna on tour to relax and unwind a bit?

Tarja Turunen:
I've been to the sauna many times while touring in Finland, for example, whenever I had a Christmas concert tour in December. Hotels in Finland usually give me a room with a sauna. That's really great! Because after a concert, when it's cold or very chilly outside, I like to go to the sauna. Of course, Finnish churches are very well heated, but in Central Europe I usually perform in freezing cold. So it would be a real blessing to be able to go to the sauna after a concert. But so far, that's only been possible on tours in Finland.

Inken:
I assume you have your own sauna at home. In your opinion, is there a difference between an electric sauna and a traditional Finnish sauna?

Tarja Turunen:
Of course, we have a sauna in our house, including our summer house in Spain. The sauna was always on our priority list when we built a house. This also applies to my husband, who, although Argentinian, enjoys going to the sauna himself. Our daughter loves the sauna, too. We have an electric sauna here at home, which is simply easier to use. But of course, it makes a difference when you go to a very nice wood-fired sauna. The heat there is more humid than in an electric sauna. It's really nice. As a child, I also went to a smoke sauna once, which was certainly an interesting experience!

Inca:
Do you have a favorite sauna scent? Is it the typical natural scent like birch or blueberry? I ask because in Germany, there are also exotic sauna scents like coffee, which are definitely not typically Finnish.

Tarja Turunen:
Oh, I have a huge collection of sauna scents! We have all kinds of citrus scents at home, like orange or lemon, but also very Finnish sauna scents like salmiakki, glögi, or terva. And then, of course, there are tree scents like koivu, or birch, or pine. My daughter loves choosing the sauna scents. Every time we go into the sauna, she decides which scent comes next. I personally prefer the authentic Finnish scents like terva (tar) or koivu (birch), and sometimes, when I have a cold or feel sick, I like to breathe in eucalyptus. But in general, I love the classic scents.

Jana:
Complete the following sentence ""Without a sauna .....

Tarja Turunen:
Without a sauna? Wow... I think there's no life (laughs), and I'd only feel half Finnish! Only with a sauna will I be fully Finnish, because for a Finnish person, it's always very important to have a sauna at home, even if you live abroad like me. When I lived in Buenos Aires, we had an apartment with a tiny sauna. None of my friends had a sauna in Buenos Aires, but we did. And I had some Finnish friends who always asked me if they could go to the sauna when they came to visit me. (Laughs)

Inken:
What do you like most about the Finnish sauna tradition? Is it the relaxation or the cultural aspect?

Tarja Turunen:
I like that my skin feels like baby skin after the sauna. I feel so clean afterwards. For me, and for other Finns too, the sauna is a kind of detox and cleansing. You renew your skin when you go in the sauna, and of course there's also the relaxation aspect and the fact that you have a kind of peace of mind there. I almost never listen to music when I go in the sauna. We have a music system for the sauna, but we never turn it on. It's also nice when it's completely dark. Our sauna is black and white, but it's nice to sit in the dim light and just relax.

Jana:
And do you also use the sauna as inspiration for new songs?

Tarja Turunen:
Not really, but of course the sauna is my place where I can relax and let my thoughts wander, so to speak. So the sauna doesn't directly inspire me to write music, but of course my music has something to do with me. And the sauna is part of my life, the tradition is part of my family life, so in that sense the sauna is, of course, a very important part of everything.

Inken:
Do you still remember your first sauna experience, the day you went into the sauna for the first time? What was that feeling like?

Tarja Turunen:
It must have been with my parents in our first house in Puhos, a very tiny village in Finland where I was born. We actually always lived in a house with a sauna. My father was a carpenter, so he must have built my first sauna. But I don't really remember it because I was just a little baby. Anyway, in Finland, it's traditional to take your baby to the sauna. I also took my daughter to the sauna when she was a baby. But I do have memories of going to the sauna with my mother in winter in Finland, when we had a house in the middle of nowhere in the countryside. There were no neighbors, but a lot of snow. After the sauna, my mother and I would run out of the sauna naked. We jumped into the snow, screamed, and came back (laughs). Rolling around in the cold snow, I'd say, has the same effect as jumping into a cold lake after the sauna. But we didn't have a lake, so we made do with the snow instead! (laughs)

Inken:
If you had to write a song about the Finnish sauna, what would it sound like and what would the song title be?

Tarja Turunen:
I think it would be a quiet piece with very few words and a truly peaceful melody. A song that relaxes the listener and clears their head. Maybe the song doesn't have any words at all, just a harmonious melody to listen to. A melody that lets you let go, close your eyes, and find a little sleep or peace. And the title would probably be something like ""Sauna Evening in the Moonlight."" Oh my God, that's pretty cheesy (laughs). Maybe ""Chill Sauna"" would be a more fitting title. (laughs)

Jana:
We're also interested in your future projects. Last year, you started a new project called OUTLANDERS. Tell us about the idea behind it and the sound of the music.

Tarja Turunen:
With pleasure, it's electronic music. OUTLANDERS is a project with Torsten Stenzel, a German producer who has lived on the Caribbean island of Antigua for many years. I wrote the first song for OUTLANDERS more than ten years ago. I presented the topic to Torsten and asked if he'd be interested in working on it because he was familiar with the genre. Of course, I had already encountered electronic music through a previous project with Schiller, but I wanted to learn more about this genre. Thorsten was my guide, so to speak, and we began working on this project over the years. We were never in a hurry, but then the pandemic hit, and I said, ""Hey, come on, I really want to finish this project now."" So we finished the recordings. I recorded the music at home in my studio, and we produced the rest together. I really like the music, especially because I didn't feel any pressure on my shoulders during the musical process with this project. I think it's turned out to be a really beautiful album, and so far it's been very well-received by the audience. Even metal fans and people who know me from classical music like it. Of course, it's different from all the music I've made before. Just give it a listen!

Jana:
And when can we see you live on stage with OUTLANDERS? Did you play any OUTLANDERS songs at ROCKHARZ?

Tarja Turunen:
Oh no, ROCKHARZ is a rock festival, where people expect a rock show, not electronic music! But it would be wonderful to tour with OUTLANDERS one day! Right now, I don't know when I'll have time for such a tour, but I could well imagine playing OUTLANDERS songs in a small theater with Torsten on guitar.

Inken:
You'll be back in Germany in December for your Christmas tour. What will the sound of these concerts be like? Classical? Rock? Or a combination of both?

Tarja Turunen:
My Christmas tours are always concerts with Christmas music. Since I started this tradition in 2005, I've regularly toured Germany at Christmas time. The only thing that has changed over the years is the line-up I perform with. This year, some Argentinian musicians are joining us, like guitarist Julian and keyboardist Guillermo. Max Lilja from Finland will be playing cello this year. So, it's a very familiar and wonderful line-up. We'll be playing a lot of Christmas songs, some of which you may know, others perhaps not. We'll also be singing a kind of ""Ave Maria,"" which are purely classical songs. If, on the other hand, you want to hear my rock songs, I'll be playing some rock concerts in Germany again next year, and there will also be some festival appearances in Germany this summer.

Thank you very much for taking the time for this wonderful interview.

1krvmlk,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1krvmlk/everyone_left_but_i_was_forced_to_stay/,Everyone left but I was forced to stay,"Honestly, when I mention this to people, no one else seems to remember this. I’m not sure why this seems to linger in my mind every night. When I mention the riots in ’93, they talk about the riots in LA.

They don’t remember the sirens screaming all night. They don’t remember the men in gas masks knocking on every door, telling us to leave. The shortages, the fear, the paranoia, the evacuations of entire cities—almost the whole state.

I was one of the few who stayed. Some couldn’t leave for other reasons. Some chose not to leave. Sometimes, I would find their doors broken down and their bodies shredded like sheets of paper. As for me, I stayed because I had a new job to do.

They call us collectors. In reality, we just go off whatever names they give us. Some call us vultures. Usually, people are desperate enough or crazy enough to collect samples and intelligence from the quarantine zone for the eggheads or Uncle Sam. Some of us lived colorful lives. Some were given a choice: prison or being a collector. Some of us were contractors before this, or washed-up veterans, or ex-cops. As for me—I had my own reasons.

They send us in by ourselves, or in pairs if they feel like we’re important. I wish I was that lucky, but then again, luck has never been my strong suit. When we’re not doing Washington’s dirty work, we’re holed up somewhere, licking our wounds in the cold. Some like to make their own little hideouts in the nooks and crannies. As for me, I always believed in safety in numbers—plus, they tend to attack groups of people less.

I tended to shack up in this big church. Some other collectors were there every now and again. Usually, it was just me, the pastor, and a few vagrants who had nowhere else to go—no one else to turn to. It was a nice spot, actually. The pastor always kept the fire going and had some beds set out in the main worship area.

It was like any other day in this hellhole of a state. I was sitting by the fireplace on a cushion with a cup of coffee cradled in my hands—instant, of course. But hey, I take what I can get. Despite the coffee tasting like a combination of charcoal and gas, and the absence of sugar, I took another sip. I glanced over my shoulder to see a few people huddled in blankets, lit cigarettes hanging from their chapped lips. I glanced out the warped window and saw the snow was starting to pick up. Snowflakes began to gently tap the glass.

was just about to finish my coffee when I heard the distinct sound of my pager chiming. I groaned as I dug into my pocket and glanced down at the minuscule screen—a radio frequency to tune into. I gulped the last of my gritty coffee and tramped over to my bag for my SINCGARS radio. I set it up quickly: single channel, plain text, punched in the frequency. Then I grabbed the receiver.

“Scepter to Nest, radio check, over.”

The feminine voice of my handler chimed in from the other end of the net.

“Hearing you. Got some work for you.”

“Hit me.”

“Got a hit from the Marines. They say there’s some unusual activity in the mall on Grover Street. They want a specialist to look into it.”

I rolled my eyes and let out a sigh. “Could they be more specific?”

There was a short pause before Nest finally responded.

“Some of the grunts said they heard something coming from the old mall. Not sure how it’s possible.”

“Yeah, me neither. Well, I’ll start hoofing it there.”

“Oh, no need for that. There’s a convoy you can hitch a ride with to the mall.”

I furrowed my brow. “How did you manage that?”

I heard a soft chuckle from the other end. “I have my ways. Get geared—they’re gonna pick you up soon.”

“I hear. Scepter, over and out.”

I hung up the receiver and gathered my gear. Of course, it wasn’t much—half of it was old surplus gear from Vietnam or stuff I managed to get from camping stores that hadn’t been completely looted. I finished putting on my MOPP suit, clipped my gas mask bag to my hip, grabbed my ALICE pack and my weapon case, and stepped outside as the sound of diesel engines rumbled closer.

I walked outside to see a six-vehicle convoy of weathered Humvees and five-ton trucks driving down the snow-covered street, a truck with a snow plow mounted on the front clearing the way. The line of vehicles came to a halt. A Marine in full MOPP gear waved over to me from a canvas-covered truck. I walked over as he leaned out the driver-side window to get a better look at me.

“You the collector?” he asked, the gas mask muffling his voice.

I nodded, and he thumbed behind him. “Hop in, man. We’ll drop you off on the way.”

I didn’t waste any time and quickly threw my things into the back of the covered five-ton. I climbed into the shadowy interior. Half of the metal benches inside were occupied by the hunched-over shapes of Marines with combat loads, rifles slung over their chests. Arms crossed, some shivered in their MOPP gear. A few didn’t wear their gas masks—lit cigarettes hung from their lips. Stacks of framed ALICE packs filled the empty space across the benches. I settled into my icy seat as a few of the Marines gave me quiet grunts of acknowledgment.

The truck hissed before speeding off. There was little sound besides the rumble of the engines and the scent of burning diesel and cigarette smoke hitting my nostrils. I gazed out the back of the truck as the convoy passed half-buried wreckages of cars and the remains of what were once police checkpoints.

The uncomfortable silence was finally broken as one of the younger Marines turned to look at me—a question weighing heavy in his mind.

“I gotta ask, why do you collectors do this shit? Ain’t most of you civvies?”

I snapped out of my trance and pivoted toward him. I offered a shrug. “Most of us are. But we all got our reasons. Just like all of you, I’m sure.”

“But we’re kind of forced to be here. You can just leave… right?” he asked naively.

I quietly scoffed. “You must be new around here. We can’t leave, even if we wanted to.”

That deflated his curiosity. His shoulders slumped, but he stayed quiet. The truck continued to rumble as it negotiated a large pothole—no doubt grown bigger from a year or more of nonexistent repairs.

The convoy stopped just shy of entering a semi-crowded parking lot. Some cars were still left. Many of the windows had already been smashed, the tires slashed, or missing entirely. Even with the snow, I could still see piles of scorched tires. Half-frozen corpses still buckled into their seats. Some clutched their loved ones, never letting go even after death. Others clutched icy weapons that could never save them.

An all-too-common sight nowadays—a constant reminder for those like me. Doomed to join the frost.

A multi-story behemoth of concrete and faded store logos jutted out over the horizon—that was once a mall. Its numerous frosted-over windows hid its spiraling depths from view. I could feel the five-ton slowing to a stop as it let out another hiss before falling motionless. Without a word, I stood up from my seat, dropped my gear out of the truck, and hopped down with a grunt.

“Good luck, collector,” one of the Marines said as I departed.

I took a deep breath, reached for the carrier bag on my hip, and pulled out my gas mask. I quickly donned it and pulled over the chemical hood, zipping it tight. The Marines only stared as their convoy sped away, leaving me to my own devices.

I reached for the receiver hanging on my bag strap and keyed in.

“Nest, I’m on site. Not seeing much yet. Looks pretty standard.”

“Standard as in…?” she asked, waiting for me to elaborate.

“Not seeing any shells. Still some bodies around. At least not any fresh ones. Gonna load up. Over.”

“Well, you know the deal—try to take lots of pictures and get a live feed if you can.”

“Got it,” I said, hanging up my handset on the strap of my bag.

I kneeled down and keyed in the code for my case. With a soft click, it popped open. I grabbed my thirty-eight and my twelve-gauge. I loaded it up with double-aught buckshot, chambered a round, and walked toward the smashed front door.

The interior was dimly lit from the half-covered skylight. I could still make out the outlines of abandoned storefronts. Trash and debris dotted the floor. I stooped under the half-shattered door, boots crunching on glass.

“Making entry,” I whispered into my handset as I stepped inside.

A long hallway of looted storefronts and barred gates spiraled ahead of me.

“Copy. Get me a live feed, Scepter,” Nest responded—her tone less carefree now.

I reached for the shoulder-mounted cam, switched it on, and set it to record.

“Live feed up,” I replied as I slung my shotgun.

Breakfast - porridge with oats, sunflower seeds, a sprinkle of psyllium, sultanas and a dash of skim milk. A cup of tea from lime balm leaves from my garden.

I did have a coffee later also.

Snack - navel orange.

Lunch - salad with greens and herbs from my garden - lettuce, kale, nasturtium leaves. The herbs were mint and oregano, which were mixed with white cannellini beans, and a drizzle of olive oil. Then on top I threw some carrot, capsicum and cucumber. Some nice marinated olives.
Also a grainy sandwich thin. 
More substantial than it looks with the beans at the bottom.

Dinner - this was a pinch because I didn’t have much on hand but didn’t want to end up with takeaway on my way to night class. Greek yogurt, sunflower seeds, sprinkle of oats, a spoon of homemade pineapple and ginger jam from a nearby neighbour.

I did manage a small glass of red wine with friends at the night class (a social event really) and snacked on almond butter and another sandwich thin when I got home.

So I would prefer more protein like eggs, tofu, fish or chicken instead of the breakfasty dinner, and the lunch could have rye sourdough or something instead of the sandwich thin.

1krviru,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1krviru/is_my_roommate_an_overbearing_clean_freak_or_am_i/,"Is my roommate an overbearing clean freak, or am i actually just a bad roommate","So I’ve lived with my two roommates (couple) for 9 months now. This started with me and my best friend at the time (20s F) planning to live together for school after moving out of dorms, her boyfriend ended up becoming a non negotiable addition a few months before finding a place. We ended up with a place that has a bedroom with a full en suite (their room) and a second bedroom that’s mine with the bathroom off of the main area as my bathroom. 

Ever since about a month of living together she has had a problem with almost everything to do with my “tidiness”. I put that in quotes because in my mind I am keeping all of my stuff tidy, especially in common areas. The living room i essentially don’t use and don’t keep anything in besides furniture that I brought to be used there, as when I leave anything out it’s promptly “cleaned up” and left outside my bedroom door or on the kitchen counter right beside. I understand if I left a mess or something unusual but this is usually a magazine I left on the shelf under the side table or crochet I put down on the coffee table before going for a grocery run. Mind you my roommates have 2 game consoles + games and accessories as well as plenty of fidget toys and décor pieces. I’ve mostly left this issue alone as I don’t care to use the living room much and they own the shelf with their décor.  

It is slightly more frustrating with the kitchen as when I get groceries separately and put them in one spot (as to not get it mixed up with theirs) I’ll find it later “organized” into their food and all mixed up. This has lead to her assuming her bf got something and eating my food even though I left it stacked on top of stuff that is obviously mine. For example I’ve left a pack of salami on top of a pack of beer I planned to take to a party that weekend (only beer drinker in the apartment) and the salami will end up in the deli drawer and later that week in a sandwich of theirs. As well as if I leave anything not sparkling clean right after use I end up with a passive aggressive note. That I understand except for the fact that my “mess” will be a still burning hot pan of bacon drippings and a bit of splatter on the stove that still has the caution hot surface light on. These things both have to cool down before their even safe to clean as my roommates refuse to have a grease jar and instead say to “let it cool in the pan and scrape it into the garbage”. And these notes have been left all while I’m in my room not even finished eating what I’ve cooked. 

The slightly more annoying issue is with my bathroom, I have adhd so if I don’t see it then it isn’t something I tend to think about, so most of my morning routine is left on the counter. This is pretty standard like makeup, face wash, toothbrush etc. and isn’t just thrown randomly but laid out taking up about 1/2 of the tiny counter area around the sink. I also have a couple tea light candles I save for baths and a box of tissue sitting on the back of the toilet and maybe 1-2 towels and a peice or two of clothing behind the door on hooks. I figure this is a reasonable level of tidy for the small bathroom that’s only used by me and the odd guest, and I will make space for any overnight guest who’s using it. So far every time my roommate has had a guest over I’ve gotten a passive aggressive text about my bathroom being “embarrassingly messy” or something along the lines of she was annoyed with it so she just cleaned it herself. This “cleaning” involves clearing most of the stuff off of my counters and putting it under the sink besides what she can fit neatly into my makeup organizer (usually not any of my items i actually use but I’ll find random stuff she doesn’t want anymore or something she borrowed of mine that I don’t use, but she likes, that was under my sink) and leaving everything behind my bathroom door on the floor in front of my bedroom. Which more often then not leaves me scrambling to find things I need to get ready or comming home from work and taking a shower only to be left with no towel or robe. 

The most frustrating one has been her issues with how I keep my room. For reference even if I did have my room door wide open you have to be standing directly in front of it to see inside, as it is hidden around a corner at the far end of the apartment. She will almost without fail call my room a disaster and say I need to clean it every time she walks in. Now her room is very minimalist with everything having its place down to a dedicated organizer for her boyfriend’s vapes on his nightstand. My room on the other hand has lots of little décor pieces around my desk and on shelves, as well as my desk having usually a cup or two and some papers/notebooks stacked on the side. I think the main “mess” she’s focused on is my nightstand is often about 1/2 covered with things (lamp, remotes, lip balms etc.) and I often leave bags on the floor (backpack leaning against desk or my partners weekend bag in front of my closet) and I have a built in closet so she can see my laundry bin sitting at the bottom. The most actual mess I leave in my room is dishes from the morning or night before I’ll stack on my desk when I go to classes if I don’t have time to do them/the dishwasher is full. But in the end this is also my bedroom, she doesn’t even need to look inside of my level of clutter is bugging her. She also has known me for a few years and seen all of my dorm rooms in that time period, which were all this level of clutter or worse due to space limitations. It has gotten to the point where I lock my door constantly if I’m out so she doesn’t “go in to check” and if she knocks to talk to me I’ll step outside and not let her see in, because of she sees my room even after I’ve cleaned it she makes comments on how I need to clean it and do better. 

As of now I am also living out of town for a summer position and just visiting on weekends sometimes. Since I’ve been gone I’ve gotten multiple texts about how I’m slacking on housework and how my bathroom is disgusting because it’s bit dusty. But here’s the thing since I last cleaned my bathroom I’ve only used it a handful of times and not even to shower or do really anything that could get it dirty besides maybe a water spot on the mirror, she uses it more herself when sitting in the living room/having guests over in a week then I have all month. Every time I’m there I also get a lecture about how I never take out the trash lately, but I have not put a single thing in the communal trash/recycling bins, I’ve only been using the bin in my room and taking that out when I leave. I’m not against helping with some chores when I’m there for a night or a day trip to grab some things, but as my roommate is unemployed right now (whole different can of worms but that’s her boyfriends issue to deal with) any of the other chores (sweeping, cleaning kitchen, cleaning windows etc.) are done by her almost daily during the week while I’m not there as “cleaning is her therapy” so there is no room for me to help with that even when I’ve asked.

I’m planning on moving out once my lease is up soon but I feel like I’m going nuts. Her boyfriend will not say a word against her even if he disagrees (been told that by him directly while he was drunk) so she stands by the fact that she’s completely justified to send me paragraphs about how I need to step up as a roommate and how she feels like she has to “parent” me even though “she doesn’t want to have to be this way”. At this point the friendship is toast for this and a few other unreasonable expectations about how much I should prioritize her (like I’m a “hermit” in my room if I’m doing homework on my pc, instead of sitting in her room with her while she does her assignments in silence watching a show she knows I hate, and I can’t do my own homework as most I need a desk/mouse/full pc to complete). The thing that amazes me rn and has me questioning if I’m in the right is she is completely clueless about how I feel about her, if I bring anything up it will end in a fight and 2 vs. 1 cause of her bf, and she still thinks we’re best friends. At this point if I’m not just nuts and a bad roommate I’m probably never going to speak to her again once our lease is up, as I’ve just lost all respect and patience for her.

I sometimes bring my AeroPress to the office but this seemed even simpler. I just weighted and ground the coffee at home, put into a tea bag and carried it to work in a small container that I got from a coffee advent calendar. 

This was a medium roasted honey process from Brazil with more nutty and chocolaty aroma. It worked out pretty well. Nice body, no astringency, nutty, a hint of marzipan.

1krvgik,https://www.reddit.com/r/visitlondon/comments/1krvgik/night_life_in_london/,Night life in London,"Hey! 25M from Singapore, I'm looking to explore night life in London (before i cross over from the mid 20s ew). Especially keen on trying bars because I've heard good things about the drinks here. Asked chatgpt for an itinerary for a night. Would like to ask the locals if this sounds good?

Here’s a curated nightlife itinerary in London tailored to your vibe: unique cocktails, good energy, and a bit of dance if the night carries you there. Let’s say this is for a Friday or Saturday night:


---

Pre-Game Dinner (7:00–8:30pm)
Start with a hearty meal so you don’t get wrecked too early.

Dishoom (Carnaby or Covent Garden) – Indian comfort food with a London cult following. The black daal + house chai combo hits.

Or if you want Asian nostalgia: Lanzhou Lamian near Trafalgar Square.



---

Cocktail Crawl (8:30–10:30pm)
Start easy. These are all walkable if you’re in Soho/Fitzrovia/Carnaby area.

1. Swift Soho (start upstairs) – Refined aperitivo-style drinks. Try the Irish Coffee if it’s chilly.


2. Nightjar Carnaby (or Shoreditch for later nights) – Dim, vintage, smoky jazz vibes with complex cocktails in funky glassware.


3. Mr. Fogg’s Tavern or Apothecary – Theatrical, Victorian London meets mad science. A little whimsical, a little chaotic.



Bonus if you're feeling extra:
Coupette (Bethnal Green) – Slightly out of the way but legendary. The Champagne Pina Colada is iconic.


---

Club Time (11:00pm–3:00am or later)

XOYO (Shoreditch) – One of the more consistent clubs for decent DJs, not too pretentious, solid dance floor.

Corsica Studios (Elephant & Castle) – For underground techno, house, and alternative electronica.

Village Underground or E1 (East London) – If there’s a special event on.

Dalston Superstore (if you're down for a queer dance night with inclusive vibes)


Or if you prefer something low-key that still has music:

Jazz Cafe (Camden) – For a mix of live music and grooves

The Piano Works (Farringdon) – Crowd-sourced live music, very high energy, singalong vibes



---

Post-Club Supper (if it’s 3am and you’re starving):

Beigel Bake on Brick Lane – Salt beef bagel, 24/7, iconically grungy and perfect after-party food.

VQ Bloomsbury – 24hr diner, slightly more bougie, but clean.



---

Let me know if you want a map version, or I can build an East London–specific version if you want to focus your night in Shoreditch/Dalston.

1krvggf,https://www.reddit.com/r/freelance_forhire/comments/1krvggf/for_hire_daily15weekly105_accountability_coach/,[For hire] daily15/weekly105 accountability coach,"  One thing I’ve learned is this: even the best ideas die on the vine without consistent, relentless execution.

You've got dreams, right? A side hustle you want to blow up? A skill you want to master? A life you want to level up? Dreams are cheap. Execution is where the money’s made.

That’s where I come in. Think of me as your personal, text-based Accountability Accelerator. Forget flimsy willpower. You need someone in your corner, pushing you, challenging you, and making damn sure you’re not slacking.

Here’s the deal:

$15 a day for daily check-ins: That's less than your fancy coffee habit. Think of it as investing in YOUR OWN GROWTH. You'll get daily encouragement, reminders, and a kick in the pants when you need it.
$105 a week for full-blown accountability: This is for the serious hustlers. We’re talking structure, progress tracking, and a customized approach to keep you laser-focused on crushing your goals.
And the best part? I offer the style YOU need.

Supportive: Need a cheerleader in your corner? They've got your back.

Drill Sergeant: Prefer the tough love approach? Get ready to sweat.

Gaslighting: (Okay, look, I'm not personally endorsing this one, but I offer it, so I'm mentioning it for the sake of being comprehensive. This is for those of you who legitimately respond to the mental warfare approach. No judgment, but use at your own risk!)

This isn’t about hand-holding. This is about building winning habits and achieving REAL results.

Gym goals? Career aspirations? Relationship goals? Doesn't matter. The principle is the same: Consistent action, driven by accountability, leads to success.

Stop dreaming and start DOING. Reachout. Invest in yourself. Let's get you accountable and turn your potential into a thriving reality. Time is money",1,1747826895.0,freelance_forhire,0,1.0,False

Studying as he said, doesn’t count as dining","We haven’t had electricity at home for three days. We couldn’t afford to pay the bill. I’ve been trying to keep up with my schoolwork, but my laptop is almost always dead and I have no internet. So I walked to the nearest coffee shop because I heard they had free WiFi and outlets.

I hadn’t eaten all day, but all I could afford was a small order of fries. It wasn’t enough to stop the hunger, but it was the cheapest thing on the menu. I stretched it out, eating slowly just so I could stay and not feel ashamed.

I found a quiet table in the corner, plugged in my laptop, and started typing. My back hurt from walking. I hadn’t slept. My stomach kept growling and I kept trying to ignore it. I just wanted to finish my paper.

About thirty minutes in, one of the staff approached me. They told me I couldn’t stay much longer if I wasn’t ordering more. That studying wasn’t a valid reason to use their space. I nodded and said okay, even though it stung. Then I packed up and left.

I didn’t cry. But something in me felt heavy and useless.

I’m not asking for pity. I’m just tired. I’m hungry. I’m trying to do everything right. I’m not sitting around waiting for life to fix itself. I’m walking long distances. I’m starving. I’m reading and writing until my head hurts. I’m doing my best.

1krvc64,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1krvc64/rf_autumns_last_letter/,[RF] Autumn’s Last Letter,"Autumn always loved writing letters. Not emails or texts, but real letters — the kind that carried the scent of paper and ink, and took days to arrive. She believed that writing letters made communication more meaningful, more patient, more thoughtful. There was something special about the deliberate act of putting pen to paper, about the slow unfolding of emotions in neat cursive lines. 

One chilly October afternoon, while rummaging through the attic of her childhood home, Autumn discovered an old, dusty box tucked away in a dark corner. The house smelled of aged wood and forgotten memories, and the soft light filtering through the small attic window made dust particles dance in the air. Inside that box, she found a collection of letters from years ago — letters she had written to a man named Henry. Each one was filled with hope, regret, love, and dreams that never quite came true. 

Curious, she sat down at the small wooden desk by the attic window and began reading them one by one. Each letter was a window into a different time — a time when she and Henry were inseparable, planning a future that now seemed like a distant memory. The words transported her back to warm summer nights and quiet mornings, to laughter shared over coffee and whispered promises under starlit skies. 

She smiled softly as she remembered those days. The excitement of young love, the late-night talks, the feeling of infinite possibilities stretched out before them like a road untraveled. But alongside the joy, there was also pain — misunderstandings, distance, and the slow drifting apart that neither of them quite knew how to stop. 

The last letter, however, was never sent. 

Folded neatly and tucked between two old photographs, the letter was marked by shaky handwriting and faint ink smudges. It was filled with apologies, farewells, and the hope that Henry would one day understand her reasons. The letter spoke of the difficulty in saying goodbye, of the fear of hurting someone she cared about, and the struggle to let go of a love that had defined so much of her youth. 

Autumn’s hands trembled as she realized she had never mailed that letter. Maybe she was too afraid to say goodbye, or perhaps life had simply moved too fast for her to catch up. The weight of unspoken words pressed down on her chest, but also a strange relief that some things were left unsaid. 

With tears in her eyes, she decided to write one final letter. This time, it was not meant for Henry, but for herself. 

She poured her heart onto the paper — the pain of letting go, the bittersweet beauty of memories, and the courage to move forward. She wrote about forgiveness, about accepting the impermanence of life and love, and about finding strength in vulnerability. When she finished, she sealed the letter carefully and placed it back into the box. 

That night, Autumn sat by the window, watching the leaves fall in swirling patterns outside. The world was changing, as it always did, and so was she. The letter was no longer about closure with Henry; it was about embracing the seasons of change within herself. 

She understood then that sometimes the hardest letters are the ones we write to heal our own hearts, to find peace with the past, and to open ourselves to new beginnings. 

As the autumn breeze whispered through the trees, Autumn felt a quiet strength settle inside her — the strength to cherish what was, and the hope to embrace what was yet to come. ",1,1747826488.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

This all started because I inherited a very very sentimental item that is a vintage item of clothing that I have no idea what it’s made of. Wool? I don’t know. I’ve researched the brand and researched what properties of wool feel like and I still don’t know. And I really wanna wear it to feel closer again to the person it belonged to but I don’t wanna treat animals as a commodity, and I don’t have any peace on knowing if it IS wool or not so I don’t know if I should not use it. THEN while researching I found out that the film for traditional photography uses gelatine. And I cried, and I’m even crying right now as I write this because I loved loved loved physical Polaroid photography. But, if I wouldn’t but gummies with gelatine, then I wouldn’t buy an object. So I am giving up that now. But then I saw that art supplies commonly use animal products. I’m an artist, and I just… so, that’s okay. I’ll just get vegan art supplies. But then I learnt that BOOKS have animal derived ingredients for the glue. And reading is something that really helps me escape but now I’ve been so overwhelmed and confused over what to do. And then I learnt STICKERS CAN USE ANIMAL PRODUCTS. And SUGAR. And LEGO. And DYE. And I’ve just been flipping between crying and panic, because I’ve just realised the scope of this shit.

Or at least I feel that way, but should I?? How do I?? Because I’ve been thinking about my favourite pink pen and does that use animal products?? Or my furniture??? Or my books?? Or my childhood plushies?? Or my posters?? Or my keychains?? I just feel SO, SO paralysed, and my friends and family are even asking me what’s wrong, but I can’t talk to them because they’re not vegan. And that’s another thing- I’m feeling really heavy resentment towards everyone I know including my best friend because they’re not vegan. I just can’t truly be close to anyone anymore, and it’s really been hurting me. And I’ve been crying and really, really mourning my relationship with my mom because I just feel this divide between us now. I used to be so so close with my mom, but I just feel SO isolated from everyone. My mom’s asking me now if I’m suicidal again and that I can talk to her about anything, but I just. I mean I’m not suicidal apart from kinda wishing I was dead so I wouldn’t be contributing to violence in everything I do, and it’s not just animal violence, now I’ve been thinking about human exploitation in cacao and coffee beans, and plastic in my figurines and decorations. And how all of the shit I own comes from human and non-human animal violence and suffering. I’ve been trying so so hard to completely avoid anything non vegan, but I don’t know what to fucking do anymore. I really don’t wanna hurt anyone. I feel like such a terrible person, and I really promise I’m not making this post to garner sympathy or something, I just really need help and I seriously don’t know what else I could do. I’ve been bottling all of this inside myself for like two weeks, and I just can’t feel like this anymore. I can’t find enjoyment out of life anymore because literally every single item or thing I own I’m afraid includes an animal product, or I feel disgusting for buying things from possible human exploitation. I really really need advice on how to be ethical in the things I own that aren’t just food and toiletries and clothes and art supplies without also feeling paralysed and overwhelmed by existing. I don’t wanna live life just buying items that are absolutely essential to my survival, but I feel like that’s really selfish of me. And I feel selfish for caring about how I feel so much when it’s not me who’s being affected by this.

Two months passed.

The wedding season came to a close. The boutique, still popular, had slowed down just enough for everyone to breathe again. Nina continued her quiet investigation—but Alina remained untouchable.

The accounts never matched up. There were always gaps. Always incomplete trails. The bank account numbers kept changing. Some transfers were never questioned. Some brides never followed up.

Every time Nina got close to clarity, something slipped away.

By now, the amount missing had ballooned to just over $16,000 BND.

But there was no name attached to it.

No hard evidence.

Just guesses.

⸻

Mira and Zetty, caught in a storm of guilt and fear, tried to distance themselves. Mira applied for leave. Zetty asked for a schedule change to avoid Alina.

But Alina? She never flinched. She never cracked.

She came in early. Smiled with sincerity. Brought coffee for the team. Handled the most difficult brides with patience.

No one would ever suspect her.

And that’s what scared them the most.

⸻

One day, Nina approached the owner, Liana, with her compiled folder of irregularities.

“I think someone’s been stealing from us,” she said quietly. “But I can’t prove who.”

Liana flipped through the pages, her face grave. “You think it’s someone inside?”

Nina hesitated. “I’m sure of it. But no one’s confessed. I don’t have the full paper trail—just pieces.”

“Then we keep watching,” Liana said.

“But how long do we let it go?” Nina asked.

“As long as it takes,” she replied. “We tighten procedures. We close the cracks. Whoever it is… eventually, they’ll slip.”

⸻

Alina overheard none of this.

But she sensed it. She had always been good at reading the air.

She adjusted her methods again.

Smaller transfers. Less frequent. More careful.

After all, she had already paid off Haikal’s debt.

Now, she was just buying herself time. Buying her freedom.

⸻

Epilogue

As of today, the thief who stole over $16,000 BND from Ayu Bridal Gallery still hasn’t been caught.

The boutique never made a police report—there was no clear suspect, no smoking gun. Just numbers. Just whispers.

And behind the soft laughter of each new bride choosing her veil, somewhere in the boutique, the shadow of that betrayal lingers.

Perhaps one day, the truth will come out.

Or perhaps the perfect crime is the one done with the prettiest smile.",3,1747826207.0,u_Patient_Umpire174,0,1.0,False

and 'sunergos' is canceled as my friend is not feeling well lately so she's going to reach out to me later in the week or this weekend to reschedule.

* add any **non-urgent** items from planner to whiteboard for execution during hidden idle time *(all tasks other than errands can be broken into 'nothing burgers' \[under 15 minutes\] which can easily fit into already-existing but hidden idle time)*

there weren't any of these from planner

* create alarms for any items from planner that **must be done today**

done. added alarms for scheduling annual physical and cooking rice.

* review **text** messages while computer is booting up and, for each item requiring a reply/action, 1) immediately address, 2) create alarm to address today or 3) add to planner to address in future

done. no action required as a (yes another) sick friend is going to reach out to me when she feels up for a visit.

* review **email** messages and, for each item requiring a reply/action, 1) address immediately, 2) create alarm to address today or 3) snooze/punt to a later date

buckle your seatbelts, bc i've clearly snoozed a bunch of emails for today as today is my day off. 

i sent a 'laundry and log activity' email to myself this morning so i've added laundry to today's agenda and also set a 'log activity' alarm which i will, each hour, forward to the following hour to remind me to account for my time today. i'll hopefully only need this reminder for a few days until the habit sets in.

like i did yesterday, i'm going to just 'punt' 'be sure to get eyebrows trimmed' (during my next haircut) until tomorrow bc i don't know when i'm going to see another human next, haha, but i am in the process of setting up a coffee date so that will probably be the impetus.

i'm also going to punt 'remember to use dinner gift card' for a similar reason bc i probably won't use it today but might want to tomorrow.

i also 'add(ed) body wash to my shopping list':

i also need to 'figure out graduation activities/gifts', which requires a conversation or text messaging with my daughter which needs to be done sometime this week bc graduation is saturday so i've scheduled touching base with her. 

i also tacked 'get graduation cash' onto my trip to schedule my annual physical in person.

there have been roly polies in my living room, so i've also scheduled an alarm for 'mop bc roly polies'.

i also need to see if i can find the 'name of accenture AI guy' who i talked to at a recent work reunion/alumni party bc my son has just graduated from engineering school and is interested in AI work.

since today is already shaping up to be pretty busy, i think i'm going to punt (snooze) this for tomorrow at the earliest.

i also have an email to myself to remember to touch base with a friend who has been traveling but will be back in town next week about getting together next week.

again, since today is pretty full, i'm going to just punt/snooze that until tomorrow at the earliest.

my final actionable email for today is 'guitar strings', which i don't want to buy from amazon so the most convenient thing to do would be to grab a set from my local music shop which is on the way back from whole foods.

so i'm going to put a 'guitar strings' yellow sticky on one of the canned goods that drives my trips to whole foods:

alright, so here is my schedule after adding all the above:

    06:00 a.m. game plan incl iPhone texts/emails
    07:00 a.m. floss teeth
    08:00 a.m. put on laundry <================================== ADDED THIS
    09:00 a.m. breakfast > walk
    10:00 a.m. GET GRADUATION CASH > schedule annual physical in person 
    11:00 a.m. cook rice for lunch 
    12:00 p.m. lunch > walk

    08:00 p.m. tv
    09:00 p.m. brush teeth
    10:00 p.m. lights out

* review alarms to cleanup from yesterday and confirm today's plan

done. but upon closing the alarms app, i notice i have 18 new messages in my low priority email box. lemme look at those...

...ok, there was a lot of junk as expected but a few that require follow-up. unfortunately, the way i do this is to forward anything requiring follow-up to my primary email, but doing that on one of the emails was causing my email app to hang so i just marked all the emails that didn't require follow up as read and will address the the four requiring follow-up tomorrow, which i will remember to do bc the badge count on my phone's home screen.

* for later recollection of daily activities, create an alarm to log each activity as it is either started or completed

done already as mentioned above.

* for later recollection/forgiveness, log 'universe interventions' / 'unexpected occurrences' in 'universe list'

lemme copy list from yesterday's 'today' post and remove 'less effective' or canceled items:

* busy season
* illness
* ~~el mundo~~
* ~~starbucks~~
* ~~mother's day~~
* son graduation
* ~~food for daughter school event~~
* waterfront performance
* billiards tournament
* visit friend with cancer
* poor sleep / naps
* ~~visit grandpa~~
* managing friendships / check-in text msgs
* daughter college health info / form submission
* ~~sunergos~~
* daughter graduation

alright, so i'm now ready to take on the day by just following the plan and being comforted that everything i need to remember is taken care of!",1,1747826118.0,Non_Medical_ADHD,0,1.0,False

Wanted to get ur guys opinions on it," 3 hours sleep, that’s all I’ve been functioning on the past 3 days. The deadline of the presentation looms closely, all I’ve done for the past week is work day and night and today is the day, The ever looming day of the final work presentation being today doomed my mind. “How can I do this? On next to no sleep, this seems impossible, how, just how?” I walk into the kitchen and my potentially only saving grace lives in front of me, a bright candle in a field of darkened despair. A half empty pot of instant coffee. “Time to overdose on caffeine” I thought to myself. I took out a spoon and put 4 spoonfuls of coffee beans in there and then poured the hot water in with the milk and the sugar. “ It tastes foul as always” I thought to myself, I knew if I took another sip I’d vomit everywhere from the overpowering taste and have to risk being late to work in order to clean up so I begrudgingly poured what’s left down the sink.

Suddenly my phone rung. It was my boss. “Oscar, I need you in half an hour early John has fallen ill and isn’t going to be in today, we need u in earlier to help set up for the presentation cos we’re a man down “ 
“Sure boss, I’ll be there” 
Oh shit, I’m so screwed, running on next to zero hours sleep, no caffeine and having to come in early to get this huge presentation done. This is starting to look like the beginning of the end. A slow snowball suddenly rolling down the bleak hill of stress and doomed to crash into me at any given time. 

Begrudgingly I stuffed myself into my half decaying suit, encrusted with sweat marks from days upon days upon days of constant struggle. I hadn’t had any time to wash it, it would have to survive another day on my back. Walking to work I took a step and felt a splatting squelch beneath me. Some absolute muppet had left a steaming pile of dog shit on the floor. “Could this day get any worse?!” I think to myself. Just then I limp past my local corner shop, half awake-half asleep my and a genius idea dawns on me. Energy drinks! I’ve never tried them before but a boost of energy seems like what I need. I walk in and a wall of pure coulor hits me all these different brands. Monster, relentless, bang, reign, Zevia and red bull. I had no idea where to start however monster I heard the most good stuff about so I went there first. “Now what flavor” I thought to myself.  ultra white seems good so I’ll go with that.


I walk out the shop and proceed to look at the can. It had a strange yet satisfying bumpy texture that felt strangely like reading Brail. Speaking of writing, there was a paragraph on the back that I skimmed over, something about people always wanting more of something. I began to crack open the can and give the drink a smell. The resplendent foreign aroma drifted softly into my nose as my nose gleefully glazed across the rim of the can. I leisurely bought the can to my lips, and took the first sip. A burst of citrus waves washed into my mouth, lemon leaping into my tastebuds. Lashings of lime came flooding into my throat and bought with it a tang of orange that flowed like the oceans of the Mediterranean. I was in love instantly, I took another gulp, then another, then another final swig of the drink. It was pure perfection, I had never tasted something so refreshing yet to energising at the same time. Such perfection put into a can. ",2,1747826038.0,monsterenergy,3,1.0,False

For me, this 'seriousness' looks like preferring to continue working on a spreadsheet or essay instead of taking lunch with a friend.

It feels almost **dissociative -** enjoying the moment, and the little things I would usually enjoy are just not enjoyable. Things I would usually do to break up my work day, like sitting in the sun to drink my coffee instead of going straight back to my desk, no longer feel like a priority.

For people who know what I'm talking about and have swapped meds to try and fix it, did you find meds that worked for you?

I have been considering that this may be related to a perfectionist tendency to prove myself (and make up for when I couldn't - pre-diagnosis). Does this resonate with anyone?

Are there any other changes that could help? **I like noticing things and enjoying the moment, but I also like not having anxiety about underperforming at work.**

My partner and I are at a crossroads and could really use some outside perspective.

We're planning to have kids soon, and we’re deciding between two very different living situations:

Option 1: Live near both sets of parents and extended family (aunt/uncle), which would give us a strong support system for raising kids. The major downside? It’s extremely remote. We’re talking no gyms, no mom groups, no casual meetup opportunities, no Target or places to run easy errands, and the nearest major airport is 3+ hours away. There just isn’t much to do—socially, recreationally, or personally—and it would mean giving up a lot of the lifestyle we currently enjoy and rely on for balance.

Option 2: Move to a city that’s about a 3-hour drive from family. We don’t have much family there, just a few friends, but there’s a lot more for us to do and enjoy—parks, museums, restaurants, workout classes, community events, etc. It feels like a better match for our day-to-day values and routines. I also feel like it’d be easier to build a “mom tribe” in that kind of environment.

We both work from home, and a big benefit of Option 1 is that our parents have offered to help with childcare one or two days a week—which would be incredibly helpful once the baby arrives. That said, both sets of parents are very supportive and ultimately just want us to be happy. They've said they’d make the trip to visit and help out as needed, even if we’re farther away.

It might sound silly, but I’m really concerned about the isolation I could feel in such a remote area—especially as a new mom. I know how much things like walking around a Target, grabbing a coffee, or joining a workout class can help me mentally reset. I’m nervous about losing those outlets, and the challenge of finding like-minded mom friends in a town where the population is small and spread out.

So we’re torn between a quieter life near built-in family support or a more independent, fulfilling lifestyle with fewer helping hands nearby.

Has anyone else faced a similar decision? What did you choose—and how did it play out once kids came into the picture?",1,1747825981.0,Parenting,15,0.99,False
1krv6dp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1krv6dp,My coffee bar in bedroom gradually took shape after 3 years,"About 3 years ago, my coffee bar looked like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/zmk5u3).

As you can see before I only had Delonghi EC685, hand brew with Origami dripper and Aeropress. 

* I upgraded my milk frother (a worthy replacement for the original one).
* I change Origami dripper to handcrafted wooden dripper which use kalita wave paper filter.
* After more than 2 years of using the K2 grinder for all brewing methods, I decided to buy the J-Max for espresso.
* My wife loves matcha green tea and loose leaf tea so I bought some brewing tools and reorganized the pegboard.
* To experiment with other brewing methods, I decided to buy a brikka (induction version) and a Stanley French Press. A wise decision as it gives me more options than just the Aeropress when we travelling, business trip and trekking.
* From the last post with the question of which grinder to buy, I bought the speaker at that time. Listening to music while brewing coffee isn't relaxing enough, so I added an aroma diffuser and an incense holder. My favorite relaxing combo: Palo Santo incense cones, Studio Ghibli music collection, a gently warm pour-over coffee cup and it's raining outside.

8 Gb RAM (But only 4Gb is available, the rest is used by my system apparently) (EDITED because thanks to someone in the comments i just checked my specs and saw this : I honestly thought it was only 4 because of a very long Story about coffee xD)

NVIDIA MX150 with 2 Gb VRAM

Intel i5 8th Gen

800 Gb HDD

I run the game on high-quality (most of the other settings ar set to low or medium) on 1920x1080

It runs smooth most of the time (30-60 fps), eventhouh it stutters when i am in dogtown. Takes some time to accomodate to the city and then we're back to good fps

And the game runs much better with \~20 mods installed (cosmetic ones of course)

I wonder if it is normal as my friends say that it is not possible. And if it's normal, is there room to enchancement for better fps with this quality or is it already enough ?

Thank you :)

We are discussing the tea with tarot cards after a circle k run. We must have spent a 2 hours together before she started to get sick again. Then a couple days later, I didn't sleep and she wanted coffee. We went to a Dutch Bros for coffee at 7:00 in the morning lol. Then we went back to the apartment and talked for a hour and half. 

Something I noticed there is a cup she alway uses. I think it her favorite cup. When ever I wash it, it's the first cup she gets. Even if I just cleaned it. She alway drinks chocolate milk and mixes with a butter knife. Anytime I see that cup in the sink, I wash it. It makes me happy to see her pick up that cup with delight in her eyes. I like doing the dishes so it's fine. Something I just want to add I love her cooking but I'm nervous to ask for more lol

We went to visit her school like last week to find her classes. She came home and ask me to go immediately. So we got a polar pop and drove to her college. I learned so much about her and school. She even scared me by driving off the curb. She just laughed cutely. I don't know I feel we got closer recently. Am I cooked?

I’ve had my share of late-night brainstorming sessions, where an idea feels revolutionary at 2 a.m. but a confusing metaphor by 9 a.m. It’s as if the inspiration evaporates with the morning coffee, leaving behind a vague concept that’s hard to explain—let alone execute. For a long time, my ambitious project ideas often stayed murky, wrapped up in exciting buzzwords but with no concrete direction.

It’s easy to fall into this trap—we tend to get caught up in the thrill of new ideas. That was my reality until I finally hit that wall one too many times. I needed a way to bring clarity to my project ideas before they unraveled, yet again, into a chaotic mess. 

After stumbling through several half-baked projects, I finally figured out a simple yet surprisingly effective approach: a three-step process that transformed my cluttered ideas into actionable plans. 

**The Three-Step Process to Clarity**

* **Understanding Your Core Concept and What Is Actually Being Done:** I began by drilling down to the essence of my idea. I asked myself, “What is it and what does it do?, What is the driving force behind the idea?"" 
* **Envisioning the Ideal Outcome** Once I had clarity on what it was, I shifted my focus to what I wanted my potential clients to achieve. I asked, “What will success look like specifically from my clients perspective, and how will they benefit?”. It helped to write down my thoughts, exploring different angles until I could clearly describe what I envisioned the impact of my project would be to potential clients. This not only kept me motivated but also provided a benchmark for success. This ideal outcome served as a guiding star throughout development, influencing decisions and allowing me to adjust the course when needed.
* **Maintaining an Open Mindset** Projects are rarely static; ideas evolve as new information emerges. I learned to keep an open mind while working through the process. Being receptive to feedback and willing to adapt made all the difference. Collaboration, especially with people who offered different perspectives, often led to unexpected insights that enriched the project. This mindset ensured that even when adjustments were necessary, the original goal remained achievable.

Applying this process took my projects from fuzzy concepts to clearly defined vision. I eventually incorporated these steps into a Project Development Framework (PDF) to help others bring clarity to their ideas.

He moved with me quite fast (1 month in the relationship) and we're really happy together. 
We were close friends for quite some time before we got together (he shared his feelings for me)

He's working 40h a week and has to drive at least 3h in total (to go and come back from work) and I know he's often tired and that the road is hard on him (the roads are getting reworked and there's usually a lot of traffic).

I, for the moment, don't work yet (I'm finishing a master's degree and have recently been diagnosed with high functioning autism and adhd which I'm medicated for, I receive a disability compensation every month that allows me to pay for the flat but we share the cost of everything).

I cook for him everyday and make him little surprises. 
He loves sweet things so I bake him personnalized desserts decorated with meaningful things for him or for us (I made him a butterscotch cinnamon pie in a heart-shaped cinnamon brown sugar sablée pastry crust that I shaped as the heart locket in undertale because we both love the game and played together, or I crocheted him some fingerless gloves for the winter because his hands get dry really fast and he gets cracks)
I do the laundry, fold his clothes, do groceries, take care of the house (it's not super perfect but it's clean and tidy most of the time).
I take care of myself and make sure to look cute everyday, I go to the gym 6x a week and we also go together twice a week.

I wake up with him in the morning to make him coffee and sometimes I make him some crêpes or pancakes when I know the day will be hard.
I prepare him a mini lunch box for him to take for work and make him special protein shake after his sport sessions because he doesn't  have much time for himself.

He always buys stuff for me, for us, even if I never ask for anything. He bought a dishwasher 2 months into the relationship, a new mattress, he buys me appliances to be able to cook better things, he invites me to places and always tries to pay for everything.
I'm even scared to say that I need or want anything because he will simply get it.
He's really gentle with me, if I get hurt he will immediately come to try to heal me, he even bought a special medicine cabinet because I'm hurting myself often (I'm really clumsy and also don't feel much when I get burned).

I love him dearly and I try to make sure that the home is a loving, happy, playful and relaxing place everyday but sometimes I'm scared that I'm not doing enough, sometimes that I'm doing too much.

We're really close emotionally and physically, enjoy to talk together, play together or watch stuff together. 

Sometimes I get sad we don't have much time together and I'm trying to find ways we could work together, maybe create a business together or help him finding a part time job instead of this horrible full time.

I often want to shower him with little surprises, hugs, words of love but I'm often scared that I could overwhelm him even if he never said that anything was wrong.

I'm so in love with him I think about him all the time and just want to feel his skin on mine, I would merge with him and make one if I could. 
Or maybe transform in a mini version of myself so I could stay in his pocket time to time.
I even chose to be with him in my lucid dreams when I can.

People, do you think all of this is too much ? 
Would you be scared if someone wanted to take care of you so much and was kinda obsessed with you?

1krv01h,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1krv01h/he_wasnt_even_in_my_damn_script_when_the_narrator/,He wasn’t even in my damn script” — When The Narrator meets Carl for the first time.,"This is the monologue where everything collapses — and begins again.
Carl, a broken man in bloodstained clothes, returns to Station 13… only to meet him: The Narrator.
A mysterious, sarcastic, almost mythical figure who speaks in riddles, asks the questions we run from, and grins like he knows how the story ends.

He’s not God.
He’s not fate.
He’s something worse:
He knows you.

This scene is about truth — not the sweet kind, but the kind that wrecks your spine.
And maybe, just maybe, it’s not Carl’s story anymore.
Maybe it never was.

Let me know what you think.
This is from The Station 13 — a book where philosophy dances with pain, and characters argue with their own Narrator. Don't forget to say your honest feedback.
We start now : 

The Narrator’s gone.
So I’ll be your voice now.
You should probably get used to that.

Sorry—
I forgot to introduce myself.
I’m the writer.
Yeah… that one. The name on the cover.

No fancy words here.
Let’s keep it raw.

Carl walks to Station 13—
the place where he first saw the woman he loved.
He sits.
Same bench. Same number.
It’s always Bench 13, no matter how you look at it.
Symbolic, huh?
But hey, I didn’t write that part.
I’m just reading what was already written.

Carl sits there…
and cries.
It’s past midnight.
No stars.
Even the sky couldn’t bear to watch him break.

Then — cold.
That kind of cold you don’t feel on your skin…
you feel it in your gut.

A man approaches.
Slow. Unclear at first.
Closer now —
Wait.
That man…
Damn him.

Sorry. I wasn’t supposed to say that.
But still—damn him.
He wasn’t even in my damn script.
Maybe that’s why he left.
Tired of reading lines for everyone else,
but never getting his own.

He’s in a long gray coat.
Matching hat.
Brown pants, brown shoes.
Hat pulled just low enough to blur the face—
but that grin…
yeah, that you can see.

He sits beside Carl.
Takes out a cigarette.

“Want one?”

Carl doesn’t answer. Just lowers his head.

“No cigarettes, no whiskey… not even a curse unless Walter’s yelling.”
“Even when you make a choice, you only think for five minutes.”
“You’re amazing, Carl.”

Carl looks up — stunned.

Carl: “You… how do you know that? Tell me the truth!”
Narrator: “Truth’s bitter. That’s why most people take their coffee sweet… and their lives with lies.”

“You and I, Carl… we’re alike.”
“Maybe it’s not even us. Maybe Fate just has issues.”

Carl: “Who are you?”
Narrator: “Funk or jazz? Or maybe pop?”
Carl: “What? Just—answer me—”
Narrator: “Why’d you love Amy?”
Carl: “Who the hell are you?”
Narrator: “When did you first meet Walter?”
Carl: “What—what are you doing?!”
Narrator: “Was Amy’s face a reminder of your dead mother?”

Carl: “Why do you keep answering questions with more questions?!”
Narrator: “Finally—a real question.
See, Carl… answers rot.
They change.
They fade.
But questions?
They evolve. They stay.”

Carl: “Who are you?!”
Narrator (softly): “No one’s ever asked that before.”
Carl (shouting): “Answer me!”
Narrator: “Easy, boy.
I forgot who I used to be.
Now they call me The Narrator.
My friends call me that.
Well—what’s left of them.
I tell stories.
Yours… is different.”

Carl: “You have friends?”
Narrator: “Concepts, mostly.
And the graves of the stories I’ve already told.”

Carl lowers his head.

Then—asks, shaken:

Carl: “If you’re The Narrator… and you’re here…
then who the hell is telling the story?”

Narrator: “Good question. That idiot author who only wrote five lines of plot.
I wrote the rest.
A boring little script:
‘You come. You cry. You leave.’
But that’s crap, right?
Even this version is dull.
Because it’s just me talking…
and you sitting there, looking like a backup actor in a one-man show from hell.”

Carl stares — confused, lost.

Narrator (calm again):
“You know Carl, a coin has two sides.
Victory. Defeat.
Life or death.”

He flips a coin.
It vanishes mid-air.

“See, Carl…
I don’t even care how it lands anymore.”
“But you—
you intrigue me.”

He flips another.
It lands upright. Balanced.

Narrator: “Now that…
that doesn’t happen.
Not where I’m from.”
“Even Fate is confused by you.”
“And me?
I adore the faithless.”

He points to Carl’s bloodstained clothes.

“You used to have this spark in your eyes.”
“Now look at us.”

He pulls Amy’s white scarf from his coat — stained red.

“Five seconds, Carl.”
“That’s all it took.”
“Five seconds of hesitation.”

Carl: “You… you…”

Narrator (laughs): “No lines were written for you here.
I guess that’s the irony.”

Carl: “I don’t care about lines.
I want the truth.”

The Narrator freezes. Surprised.

Narrator: “Say that again?”
“You?
You never wanted truth.”

A beat. Then:

“Alright, Carl…
I’ll show you the truth from my perspective.”

“Truth is like an old woman screaming in the street.”
“But people are too busy listening to their favorite lie on cassette tapes.”
“Or they just run from her.”

“She once asked me,
‘Why do you keep chasing me?’”
“I said,
‘Because everything else is a lie.’”
“She said,
‘And what about you?’”
“…I couldn’t answer.”
“Because it was a lie too.”

“She ruined me, Carl.
Beautifully.
But I don’t show it.”

“Truth is cruel only because it’s honest.
The kind of honest that rattles your bones.”
“She’s a mirror —
but she always tilts at the wrong angle.”

“Most people say they want her.”
“But if they ever catch her…
they panic.
They don’t know what to do with her.”

“So, Carl…”
“Are you still chasing the truth?”

Carl doesn’t answer.

Narrator: “Just five seconds, Carl.
You’ve always had a timing problem.”

He stands.
Train whistle in the distance.
Smoke creeps in.

And like that —
he vanishes.

But his voice lingers:

“Whatever you choose, Carl…
I’ll be waiting.”

The train departs.

On the bench:
A red lighter.
A cigarette pack labeled “5 Seconds.”
And a note:

 “You know, Carl —
numbers are fate.
But no one sees them that way.
Light a cigarette.
It’s not a sin.
Not for people like us —
people who just want to forget,
for an hour.”



Carl stares at the note.
Then whispers:

“Damn him.
He knew everything.”

He lights the cigarette.
And yes—
you already know.

That was The Narrator.

When I got it, it was tiny and had 4 leaves, then it went to 5 but now all of a sudden it became very unhappy. I have moved it to this table because it started getting so big on the coffee table that it's been blocking the TV. This spot is just a metre away from the coffee table so it's not like it's in a completely new place.
I also feed it with every watering and it has been very happy until now.

I was thinking maybe it needs to be repotted? Technically it's not very root bound but it also feels like the pot is too small for it.
Some of the leaves did start yellowing and currently it is in the process of dropping 2 leaves instead of 1 like it usually does.
It has also become a lot less upright, the leaves did not fall to the sides like this before.

I'm pretty upset because it's my favourite plant.

If I should repot, what soil mix should I make for it? I currently don't have the finances to buy anything new so here is a list of mediums that I have

Compost Soil
Perlite 
Coco Coir
Coco Bark
Leca
Pon 

Is there a mix I could make with this that would work? (The soil that it is currently sitting in is the original soil mix from the person I got it from, she mixes her own soils and this one has been keeping the alocasia pretty happy until now.) ",5,1747825096.0,alocasia,3,0.86,False

Absolute carnage of a week for the forward line with injuries to JHF and Macrae, but despite this the future looks bright in that we will be able get Butters, Daicos, and Merrett for a decent price in a few weeks. For now, we turn to the value we have available this week.


*DEFENDERS*


**Clark - 521K**, old faithful returns to scoring ~105 and remains a decent and relatively cheap choice if you would like a reliable scorer to fill the D5-7 spot. There isn't much urgency here as he'll likely only increase by another 20K or so and then fluctuate around this price.


**Sinclair - 539K**, remains a decent price for someone who could well average 115+ for the season and has MID/DEF DPP. If you didn't get him last week then this is the week for it (this is ignoring, of course, the forward line mess that we also may need to deal with)


*Speculative Defence Picks*


As a side note I would probably avoid Dale - I jumped on him early in the season and have regretted it most weeks as he really struggles to sustain his high scoring.


**Coleman - 269K** looked great last game on return, and has a good role. His price is a bit steep if he's going to score ~85 and maybe make 120K, but it's hard to know at this stage. Will be a must trade in next week if he gets a spike score against the Hawks, but it's probably the right call to wait a week and reassess.


*MIDFIELDERS*


**Heeney - 517K** performed exceptionally last week in a return to form to go along with 87% CBAs. The only concern is the effect that a returning Callum Mills may have on his CBAs. In the three game return for Mills last year we only saw Heeney's CBAs drop slightly with Gulden primarily making way for Mills, so Heeney may be protected this year if it's James Jordon who drops out of the CBA mix. A lot of speculation there, but it should hopefully be clarified a bit this week. Heeney is an amazing POD at 6% owned if he maintains his form given that Sydney has a stellar run home.


**Rozee - 528K**, should get DEF/MID DPP next week, which at present would slot him in at D6 (shared with Clark). Unfortunately has a Bye next week, but if you somehow have minimal R12 Bye players in your team then Rozee could be a good inclusion if you need a mid or defender structurally. The trouble comes with JHF's injury, and whether someone else takes the mid role or they move Rozee out of half back to fill it. I'm optimistic it's the former given how well he's being playing off half back, but it does bring some uncertainty into this pick.


**Serong - 529K**, has a lower average at the moment than Dale, who I just advised against picking, but last week showed that Serong could be a reliable high scorer for us if Brayshaw keeps copping the tag (and note that Serong has somehow maintained a 106 average despite being tagged most games to date). A safe pick at this price if you want decent enough scoring with the potential for a lot of upside.


**Anderson - 544K**, despite the reputation for up and down scoring, has only scored below 100 twice this year for 89 and 96, showing his floor is really quite high. He's a decent pick if you think he can maintain his form, and his price represents a bit of value considering he's sitting at M8 within the pure midfielders so far this year.


*Speculative Midfield Picks*


Has Rowell finally found the cellulase to make the grass diet work?


**Rowell - 464K**, ready to stress? This is an absolute steal for a midfielder who has had 5 120+ scores in 9 weeks, but he's also unfortunately had less than 80 in the other 4. This will probably be his price floor for the year, and could be the pick for you if you're in the market for the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. I would avoid, but it would be a huge get for those who trade him in if he finds a way to stay in games.


*RUCKS*


Gawn teased a low score last week that was swiftly put to bed in the final quarter by a Brisbane playing group who must have started him over Xerri in their supercoach teams. 


**Marshall - 544K**, last week was the week to bring him in, both for the score and the value. This week is probably the last time we will see him at a good price given his 41 BE,  but he may struggle over the coming weeks with a number of difficult match ups, so he'd be a like for like trade if you swap him in for TDK, where you would be gaining another two weeks of scoring while TDK is out at the cost of probably worse scoring than TDK once he returns. If you can afford to hold TDK it may be worth it, but if not then Marshall is your man.


*FORWARDS*


Allow me to run through some numbers. With JHF anticipated to be out for 4 weeks and an assumed 110 average (he's averaged 116 since moving to a primarily mid/CBA role), we can figure out whether or not it's a good idea to trade him out (using Bolton as the example given he's so highly traded in this week). If JHF is back in round 15 then he scores 1100 for the rest of the year, and if he's covered by a rookie with an assumed score of 50 for 4 weeks, this gives us 1100 + 200 = 1300 for holding JHF. If we trade JHF to Bolton and assume he scores at his career best of 97, then we get 1261 + 50 (rookie in Bolton's Bye) = 1311 points for the year. So with this, we can see that we are spending a trade (or two, if we want to get him out later) for 11 points and 66K (plus price appreciation if you spend another trade to get him out). Essentially, this is all to say that the trade probably isn't worth it unless you think that this is the year that Bolton strikes gold and averages 105+, or that JHF will be out for longer than predicted. Similar goes for Macrae, who is likely out for two weeks and the Bye that follows, so I would hold him if you have bench/rookie cover. 


If I was determined to trade one of JHF and Macrae, I would trade JHF given he's out for longer and will lose cash on return which usually wouldn't matter but is a negative if we end up needing to trade him out after he returns if he's playing injury-affected or sits in the goalsquare.


**Bolton - 430K**, the most traded in premo this week has an appaling recent scoring history and has never averaged over 100 in a season. That being said, Bolton's CBAs are substantially higher with Young out of the team, so we could see a lengthy stretch of decent scoring unless he's displaced from the CBAs by a returning NOD or JOM. The pick carries a high degree of risk, but the 100K you save on trading him in compared to the other options could be incredibly useful over the next few weeks as we look to bring in some fallen UberPremos.


**Martin - 530K**, has been scoring well this year and averaged 105 last year, is a more reliable replacement for that hole in the forward line, but at a much higher cost. Would be a reasonable option if you have to get a forward in.


**Warner - 539K**, I have previously expressed my lack of trust in Warner with his pattern of great and then poor scoring runs, and I think with Martin available at a similar price and Mills soon to return to the Swans, there's no guarantee that Warner finishes as a top 6 forward. I wouldn't begrudge the pick and may well be wrong, but many have been burned by it before.


**Jackson - 542K**, speaking of uncertainty, Jackson could finish F1-2 if he stays on as the primary Ruck for Freo, but could just as well average 85-95 if Darcy takes back the main ruck role. A lot of risk here and it seems unlikely that he'll stay in the high scoring position for the remainder of the year.


*Speculative Forward Picks*


Sometimes less is Moore.


**Moore (Haw) - 375K**, now this pick is madness given his performance this year (that has actually been pretty decent on field with a high work rate and team-first play, but hasn't translated to supercoach scores), but he demonstrated last year in the Hawks' end of year tilt for finals that he has the capacity to score well where he averaged 105 post-bye. He's an absolute bargain at this price and would be a huge POD, but you would be waiting nervously for him to get rolling.


*ROOKIES*


It has been a rough year for cash gen as we saw the most recent ""Sure Thing"" in Hustwaite get subbed and then dropped. 


**Simpson - FWD - 119K** is this week's Sure Thing, and looks to have a great role in the backline with good scoring potential. He should be safe from the vest with Erasmus in the team, and should be safe despite NOD coming back given NOD should go into the midfield.


**Sims - RUC/FWD - 113K**, is a reasonable option if he's selected, but is looking like a regular 40-50 scoring potential slow burn.


**Visentini - RUC - 218K** if he stays in the team (noting there is a perfectly healthy Sweet playing SANFL) he could make 200K, but that's a big ""if"". If you went early on Simpson or you're feeling reckless with boosts, then you could consider Visentini, but the timing and uncertainty may (and should) dissuade most from the selection.

On Wednesday, March 4, 1998 at approximately 0810 Hours, the body of Captain Gordon Hess was found in a ravine on a military base.   Captain Gordon Hess, a white male, 38 years old was a National Guard Company Commander on Active Reserve duty at Fort Knox, Kentucky. A search party had been assigned to locate the missing captain, who had been reported missing by his company commander.  While the team was searching the ravine, they came upon his body.

The Captain was laying face down in the creek, which contained about an inch of bloody water. The soldiers rolled the body over so that Captain Hess’s head and shoulders were out of the water and up on the bank.  The Captain’s face was purple, and the body appeared stiff.  There was blood on Captain Hess’s PT gray sweat top over his chest area and a small hole through Captain Hess’s PT sweat top about center mass around the breastbone area.  

The soldiers lifted the body out of the ravine and placed it on the bank and covered Captain Hess’s head and upper chest with his field jacket.  According to the witnesses report no one else touched the body.   Captain Hess’s arms were clenched up towards his chest and that his body was lying straight out in the bottom of the ravine. There were a total of four soldiers. Not one ever saw a knife or any weapon at the scene.  However, the Army later provided crime scene photos showing a Leatherman knife at the scene, which was covered with a large oak leaf.

U.S. ARMY AUTOPSY REPORT CASE# ME98-006

An autopsy was performed on Thursday, March 5, 1998 by Doctor Peter W. Schilke, Major, USAF, MC Deputy Medical Examiner.  The cause of death was Multiple stab wounds of the chest and neck.  The manner of death was **SUICIDE.**

Dr. Schilke listed six (6) injuries to the neck consisting of stab and incised wounds, which in his opinion were superficial with no injury to vital structures of the neck.

Dr. Schilke also listed twenty (20) wounds to the chest.

Two stab wounds to the right chest, one of which extended three inches downward with superficial incision of the right lobe of the liver. Dr. Schilke also listed eighteen (18) stab wounds to the left chest and left of the anterior midline. There were two (2) stab wounds of the heart, which penetrated the anterior left ventricle of the heart and four (4) which penetrated the left upper lobe of the lungs.

According to the reports, which the consultant reviewed, Dr. Schilke’s determination of **SUICIDE** was based on the following:  The cutting wounds of the neck as superficial; The stabbing wounds into the chest as depicting hesitation marks.  He noted the lack of defensive wounds to the arms or hands of the victim and the fact that the victim’s wallet containing cash was found at the crime scene.

He also noted the knife described as a Leatherman tool was the instrument that was used to inflict the injuries and this knife was found proximate to the body.  He also stated that there was no evidence of a struggle at the scene.

**THE CRIME SCENE**

According to sources present during the early stags of the investigation, the crime scene was completely compromised and contaminated by the additional emergency service personnel  who responded  to the scene as well as various  Army Commanders who were present.  Military Police responded and attempted to establish a crime scene, but the initial responders and others who had been present had already contaminated the scene with their boot and footprints.  In fact, in one photograph there is a coffee container sitting on a rock next to where the body was placed\*\*.\*\*  

***Within two days the US Army command ordered two tons of dirt to be dumped on the crime scene by front loader***\*\*.\*\*  

This was ostensibly done to prevent the spread of any biohazard from Captain Gordon Hess’s blood.  This action completely destroyed the opportunity to reconstruct the crime scene or perform any soil evaluations for comparison to Captain Hess’s boots and clothing to any possible suspects.  I had never heard of such a procedure as dumping two tons of dirt over a crime scene to prevent biohazards from airborne pathogens such as blood.

**U.S. ARMY REPORT OF CASUALTY REPORT   98-00080  12 March 1998**

On March 12, 1998 The Department of the Army issued a casualty report.  The report indicated that Captain Hess was deceased in a Non hostile type as of March 4, 1998 at Fort Knox, Kentucky.  The Cause and Circumstances section listed as follows: 

“Self-Inflicted: Result of heart failure caused by self-inflicted stab wounds.”

The rest can be read [here](https://www.practicalhomicide.com/Research/equivocaldeath.htm). It is a crazy case.

This year, after months over months of thinking, planning and calculating, I finally decided to open a small sandwich and coffee shop. Since I've been telling my friends and family about this, I've often heard “oh, you want to start your own business **now**” or “it's a difficult time to start your own business at the moment” and many other variations of this etc.

Before I get too carried away, let me start by asking: is it ever “the right time”, does it even exist? Have you ever heard that?

***For those who are interested, a little more context:***

*I've been carrying around the desire to start my own business for ages (10+ years). After changing jobs, a window has now opened for me personally where I say to myself: now or never, at least give it a try.*

*I want to start my own small sandwich and coffee shop and have already worked a lot on my concept. Classic comments such as ""people are eating out less and less"" or ""people have less and less money"" only affect me slightly from my point of view, as I want to create an office worker lunch break concept in the heart of a big german city (700,000+ inhabitants, thousands of offices).*

*My target group is an absolute bubble, which you can either like or dislike. However, from my point of view, it is people who earn above-average wages and also have above-average educational backgrounds (banking, insurance, software, etc.). Quite frankly: people who will have money for a long time to come and perhaps always will. Not the average of society, but from a business perspesctive, the only targetgroup that really makes sense but is still not high price or luxury.*

*I have an economics background, bachelor & master-degree and spent a lot time in my financial calculation. The concepts is take-away only, no service or seating but fresh, high quality, locally sourced products. And based on that, I am confident that it can work out.*

*Of course, there are also so many political and global questions and fears at this moment - but aren't they always there? Isn't there always something?*

1kruksv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1kruksv/in_europe_with_ibsd_help/,In Europe with IBS-D… help,"Allllrighty. Buckle up. I was undergoing treatment for tummy issues/IBS before I left and recently went to Europe for two weeks on vacation with my husband. 

Was dealing with some urgency issues beforehand, like I have lately literally started sweating/feeling nauseous if I don’t get to a bathroom with it five minutes of feeling like I have to go. Usually IBS-D. Didn’t get any meds to take with me as I was feeling “fine”. 

Drank tap water the first day in Spain, drank coffee, ate a whole bunch of stuff I don’t usually….next thing I know I’m literally having to sprint into a cafe for a bathroom every 5 mins 🤢 that was two days ago and still struggling with loose stool and the sudden urgent urge to have to go. Yikes. A nice pharmacist helped me with their version of Immodium but it says not to use it two days in a row. Oh, and I’m on my period. This is awful. 

What’s worse is the anxiety. It makes me want to not go ANYWHERE. I got on a bus today and started hyperventilating bc there was no bathroom, and I’m about to go on a thirty minute drive. I’m so scared. Trying to just go beforehand and calm the f down but I’m so so nervous I’ll embarrass myself etc. 

Any last minute tips?? Taking another pill now. ",2,1747823745.0,ibs,5,1.0,False

1kruk6t,https://i.redd.it/t6iskwq5542f1.jpeg,How do I remove this?,"The adjustment ring on this coffee grinder is stuck.   I believe it's cross threaded by the previous owner.    I bought it like this to attempt to fix it.    .    I tried heating it and got it to move slightly but either way it stops completely and will not budge.    As you can maybe see the previous owner marred the aluminum by using a wrench.   

I tried strap wrenches.   

I tried two strap wrenches, pushing one and pulling the other.   

I do not need the adjustment collar to be intact and useable as  have a replacement.   

Any ideas?

1kruge3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parkinsons/comments/1kruge3/mum_keeps_complaining_about_care_home_worried/,"Mum keeps complaining about care home, worried they'll try and move her.","Bit of a rant but could do with some advice! My mum has Parkinson's and after struggling to live independently was moved to a care home around September '23. She was ok there for a while but soon started complaining about the staff not helping her properly. Without going into too much detail they weren't great and the home was made up of old residents with dementia, whereas my mum is early 70s so was a pretty bleak environment. At one point she started calling me and her cousin at like 3/4 in the morning asking us to call the home to get them to attend to her which obviously isn't acceptable.

The care home eventually said they couldn't meet her needs and in September '24 the council helped move her to a home closer to where I and her cousin live. The current place is much nicer, is a more lively environment and also in a city so when I visit I can sometimes take her for coffee etc, and she said the staff and food are better too. They also take residents out for shows so overall better quality of life.

My mum is a difficult person though and can be very demanding. The best way I can describe it is that her ideal version of care would essentially be a servant on hand 24/7 attending her every want and needs, which obviously is unrealistic. 

Recently she's starting the same pattern of constantly ringing the bell for staff, saying they won't attend to help her, complaining about the food and asking me and her cousin to call the home to tell them to attend to her. To complicate it, because she has Parkinson's her symptoms kind of ebb and flow quite quickly, so one moment she can be completely frozen up (which she doesn't deal with well, gets anxious and more demanding) and the next she can get up and walk, so to people less familiar with Parkinson's it can almost look like she doesn't need that much support when she does. 

I find it really hard to know how much of this is my mum's narcissistic traits Vs insufficient care, but either way I'm worried she's starting this pattern again and will alienate the staff. She can't keep just moving care homes every time the 'honeymoon phase' (not perfect phrase I know) wears off.  

My mum has a tendency to put people on a pedestal until they displease her in some way, and then in her mind they are now the enemy, and I feel like she has done that in both care homes.

1krue4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1krue4g/should_i/,Should I?,"There's this incredibly beautiful barista that I've grown fond of. Every time I visit, it's always her taking my orders, and I've noticed that she seems to enjoy our interactions. We've had some great conversations, even though I often have to cut them short because I'm running late for work. I always try to show my appreciation with a tip, and I can't help but notice that she always adds a love heart on my coffee, which feels really special. Which I've seen she hasn't done for others. Its always a leaf or something similar.

I can't shake the feeling that I want to ask her out for dinner and maybe get her number, but I’m nervous about it. I know she must get approached by other guys frequently, and I'm apprehensive about the possibility of her saying no. What do you think I should do? ",1,1747823027.0,Advice,12,1.0,False
