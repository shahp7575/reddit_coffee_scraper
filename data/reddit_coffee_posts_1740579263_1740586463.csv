Why is it so difficult for me and other old-souls like me to find friends and true love?,"I have a dilemma. I’m not socially awkward, but my conversations take a different path than most people my age. What starts as casual small talk naturally turns into deep discussions about ambitions, family expectations, and how we see the world. People engage, appreciate these conversations, and even admire me for them. But I’m never truly seen as a friend. Instead, I feel like I’m viewed as a wise, compassionate figure—like a grandpa or an elderly neighbor—respected, but not someone people casually invite to hangouts, parties, or even follow on social media.

One thing I’ve noticed is how people adjust their behavior around me. In high school, I volunteered at the library with an extremely extroverted girl. Around her friends, she was loud, carefree, and swore like there was no tomorrow. But with me, our conversations were deep and meaningful—about our identities, cultures, and struggles. I remember us dwelling on how it feels to be an immigrant, trying to juggle between modern thought and our own cultural values. She never swore, never joked the way she did with her friends with me. I know she valued our conversation and connection. I could tell by her engagement, and her warm smile. Yet, I wasn’t her friend in the way her other friends were. When we would meet in school, she would smile and wave hello. She would never talk bad about me, even if her friends might give me a weird The same pattern has played out in many of my relationships—people show me respect, but they don’t fully let me into their world.

And if I can’t even be seen as a casual friend, how will I ever be seen as a romantic partner? I fear that if I ask someone to grab coffee, they’ll say yes out of admiration or politeness, not genuine interest. Over the years, I’ve tried changing how I present myself, but I always return to who I am. How do I bridge this gap—so I’m not just the person people respect, but someone they truly want to be around?

  
And don't get me wrong, while I'm mature in nature, it's not like I'm stuck up and serious. I'm lighthearted and I like to laugh too. But its just different. ",1,1740586204.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Pinterest Ads provide a unique avenue for businesses to capture attention and drive engagement, and there are countless Pinterest Ads examples you’ll wish you thought of. These creative campaigns stand out for their visual appeal and strategic messaging, demonstrating how to effectively reach target audiences.

One standout example is the DIY home decor brand that utilized video pins to showcase easy-to-follow crafting tutorials. By combining step-by-step visuals with engaging content, they not only boosted their brand awareness but also encouraged viewers to save ideas for later, creating a lasting impact.

Another successful case involved a fitness apparel company that tapped into lifestyle-centric boards. Their ads featured authentic user-generated content, showcasing real customers wearing their products during workouts. This relatable approach fostered a sense of community and motivated potential buyers to envision themselves as part of the brand's story.

Local cafés have also embraced Pinterest Ads effectively. For instance, a charming coffee shop launched a seasonal campaign featuring mouthwatering images of autumn-themed beverages paired with cozy fall decor. The combination of inviting visuals and local engagement tapped into the seasonal spirit, leading to increased foot traffic and social media buzz.

- **Interactive Content:** Brands can leverage polls and quizzes to engage users.
- **Event Promotion:** Using ads to spotlight local events or workshops.
- **Holiday Campaigns:** Creating themed content around major holidays.

Employing such creative ideas can set your Pinterest Ads apart from the crowd, harnessing the platform's visual nature to inspire action.

1iyr109,https://www.reddit.com/r/SophiaWisdomOfGod/comments/1iyr109/christs_math_pashkas_stories/,Christ’s Math. Pashka’s stories,"**Peter Davydov**

https://preview.redd.it/oeo09a50cile1.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=30fd9f71f0e614917a913ae09d17b82bab46c30a

“He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given will he pay him again,” Pashka announced instead of “Good evening!” And without further ado, he marched towards the kitchen unpacking some sweets along the way. Gingerbread. I think, Serbian ones.

“Just think of it!” I said to myself. “Solomon himself came knocking!”

In anticipation of another dose of wisdom, I went after him. He sat there, gawking at the teapot—definitely nothing regal in his looks, but we’ve learned to put up with it.

“Sooo…” I prompted.

“Mmm…yes,” he mumbled. “So, I put God into debt and then got it hot and strong. Hot and red up to the roots of my hair.”

Then he shared his story:

“Man’s a weak character. Some time ago, after some ugly situation, I began to feel a dreadful hostility towards our neighbors, the Finns. In Helsinki, at some café, I came across some local fascists who got nasty with me, so I began to think that all Finns are alike; and I sort of transferred my disgust for Nazism over to the whole nation. And that despite the fact I knew quite well that there are some really worthy people, even disciples of St. Paisios—but at the time, blind malice was more powerful than common sense. I’d turn away from them anytime I chanced upon them, snorting angrily: Why should I, an Orthodox Christian, deal with *these people*? Recently, God put me in my place.”

“You know, I have to travel a lot because of work, it’s a fact. So, I happened to be in Belgrade on business. I was in my hotel, suited and booted, so to speak. It was early morning. Next, a guy shows up there in the hallway, totally bashed up. His head in wraps, blood stains on his sleeves, like, after a nice walk around the city, man. I told him to go and wash himself up to at least rinse off the blood, and then made him sit down at my table just to keep him from freaking out anyone else who might see him. So he sat with me, trying to hold a cup of coffee steady in his shaky hands. Then, he began to wail:

“ ‘A-a-a-a… Yesterday I went for a walk around town and happened to wander into a rough section.’

“ ‘I see you weren’t received too graciously’.”

“I was robbed, beaten up, they took everything. I was lying half-conscious for half the night—and after I regained consciousness I shuffled off back to the hotel. Policemen stopped me twice on my way back, they kept asking what happened, but I don’t know the language to a-a-a-nswer them! And what can I tell them? That I took a wrong turn and got beaten up?”

They were speaking in English, but Pashka caught a slight accent. Sure enough, Finnish.

“Aren’t you,” he asked, “from Finland by any chance? Maybe from my beloved Helsingfors?”

“Uh-huh! From Helsink-i-i-i!”

“There is justice in this world,” my friend was just about to think, but then he came to his senses; gloating over the misfortunes of others is a disgrace through and through! A beaten up and mugged guy with no money, thousands of kilometers away from home—it was a pitiful sight! He suggested a solution to him:

“Why don’t you call home for money, poor guy. Use your phone. While you’re waiting for it to arrive, here’s fifty euros for you (this made me feel sad for a moment—those lousy sanctions also apply in Serbia!) for medicine, food and all that. Belgrade is not on the cheap side, I know it!”

Then he thought: Fifty euros converts to about five thousand rubles. Oh, never mind, I’ll survive today without lunch, a tour and supper, and I’ll walk to my business meeting. I’ll manage. “Next, for good measure, a selfish thought popped up—why don’t I have God owe me a debt? I was so good today, I didn’t retaliate, I’m just remarkable!”

The beaten man bent double accepted the banknote with gratitude and trepidation, called home, described his sticky situation, asked them send him money, and then went to find a first-aid station and pharmacy.

Pashka sat self-righteously in the hotel café and humbly observed the sinful reality of life around him. God is now indebted to him!

His phone beeped. A message announced the arrival of fifty thousand on his bank card, marked, “Donation.” Pashka’s eyes open large as saucers to the point that an obliging “konobar” (waiter) began to get concerned—they had had enough trouble with one unconventional visitor that morning, and now this one has lost it. He asked him if he needed anything.

“Water,” Pashka breathed. “And, um, where is the nearest church?”

In the church nearest to his Belgrade hotel, Pashka reread letter by letter the Parable of the Good Samaritan, understanding all too well that he was light years away from that kind fellow. Deeply distressed, he even forgave all Finns together. He thought of the disciples of St. Paisios.

“Christ has some interesting math, doesn’t He?” he says. “Even when we do our miserly, sinful acts of mercy, spiced with a good dose of vanity, He answers in such measure—good, pressed down, shaken together, and running over (cf. Luke 6:38). True, there are also the terms of the contract: *Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: Give, and it shall be given unto you* (Lk 6:37). Hard, eh? Sometimes you have to travel a couple thousand kilometers just to get it. But it’s worth it.”

Inova Health System, Virginia’s trailblazer in healthcare innovation, isn't just treating patients—it's turning data into its lifeline. At the helm is Matthew Kull, a tech guru whose mission is anything but transparent. Or maybe it is—if you're fluent in data.

Imagine you're working in one of the country’s busiest emergency departments, but instead of relying on intuition, each decision is supported by a robust AI forecast. It's not science fiction; it's Inova's daily operations. The real kicker? They're not just treating symptoms but preemptively writing prescriptions for the future by harnessing AI to personalize medicine down to your DNA.

But wait, before you picture robots with MDs, Kull emphasizes that AI’s role is to lighten the non-clinical load. By offloading paperwork through AI automation, healthcare professionals get more face-time with their patients—not with screens.

While AI might be the lead actor, security has a vital supporting role in this drama. Kull ensures healthcare data is as guarded as a Hollywood script, with protocols so tight you'd swear they were written in Fort Knox.

As technology evolves faster than you can say “machine learning,” Inova is not just keeping up—they're setting the standard. Kull envisions a future where team members converse with data as naturally as they do over office coffee. It's not just about keeping pace; it's about leading the marathon.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

**I. Prologue - Someone's Day Off Is Someone's Work Day** 



A sunny day at Gehenna Academy. And today was supposed to be another day of work for Fuuka But...



Fuuka: WHAT?!

Fuuka: The school cafeteria is closed for a day today...?

Fuuka: I-Is this real...?

Fuuka: Oh my... I hope this isn't a dream...!

Fuuka hit herself on the head with the handle...: Ouch... This isn't a dream...

That's right, even Aikiyo Fuuka, the Head Chef of the Lunch Club, couldn't believe that the entire club had a day off today, she called Sensei to inform him of the news and they replied that they congratulated her and hoped she would enjoy her day off. With this opportunity, she could go explore here and try things she'd never tried before, but she was a little worried about what would happen if she left...

From far behind, a familiar figure was approaching in a maid outfit to greet Fuuka, it was her junior, Ushimaki Juri. She explained to Fuuka that she was working part-time at a nearby coffee shop, Fuuka worriedly asked Juri if she should rest but she replied:

Juri: Even though I can't cook, when I serve food, it feels like I made it myself!

Seeing Juri's working spirit, Fuuka was no longer worried and wishes her success in her work. Juri then asked Fuuka if she had any plans to go anywhere, Fuuka said that she didn't know where to go first. But, since time permitted, she decided to go to many places to enjoy this day off.

Seeing Fuuka so relaxed for the first time, Juri was certainly quite surprised, she wished Fuuka a happy day off and then the two go in two different directions. Juri told herself that no matter what happened, she wouldn't ask Fuuka for help but would solve it herself.

https://preview.redd.it/fbfqgjvn8ile1.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6a11572d54bb21b7bd92ea00ed49956c2711c02

.

At the cafe where Juri worked, everything was going very smoothly, Juri was enjoying her work and the manager, after being proved Juri's ability to work, wanted her to become an official member of the winery, but Juri refused because she was still working at the academy. As for the reputation of Gehenna school cafeteria, just hearing about it made the manager think of their regular work and the outstanding quality of their food. Perhaps the manager also thought that Juri was a good chef to be able to withstand that pressure. Juri thanked them for the compliment. (Me: This man didn't know what's **really** inside)



One more thing, the manager had been busy recently and heard rumors about some 'monsters' causing chaos on the streets of Gehenna. Juri ""knew about that"" and was surprised. Well, it's just rumors, only believe after seeing, anyway, it wouldn't affect today's sales with Juri around. Suddenly, a large explosive was discovered from the cafeteria's warehouse.



The two of them quickly ran in and saw the head chef lying on the floor and a stove exploding after the chef tested the new burner, turned out that a Gehenna student who was passing by accidentally dropped the gunpowder in that machine and the chef was unconscious. Outside, customers were still waiting for their food, at this rate the restaurant's revenue would be gone, so the manager wanted to temporarily allow Juri to stand in the kitchen and make Pancakes, the recipe was simple and they had already made the dough so all she had to do was cook it. But Juri was still worried because she couldn't cook. Well, the manager understood her, this job was quite difficult. They came up with this idea, how about calling Fuuka to come over and cook for them? This was day-off anyway. The manager replied that he wanted Juri to call Fuuka and they would pay both of them three times their salary. Juri thought back to what Fuuka said about her rare day off, she didn't want to ruin Fuuka's day off so she decided to overcome the adversity and make that cake. Although the manager was still skeptical about her ability after hearing Juri say she couldn't cook, in the situation where Fuuka was ""busy"", Juri was still the most viable choice, the manager thanked her and she went into the kitchen.

Standing in front of the kitchen, Juri still felt nervous about the recipe she was about to make. She had never cooked Pancakes before, she was serving customers, not just students, so she had to be extremely careful. She was scared, but in order to protect her beloved senior's day off, she MUST do it.

After a while, the first cake came out of the oven and it... Looked better than the ones she had cooked before? Maybe that day had come?, the day when she could make a proper dish?

Not sure what I'm talking about? ....

---------------------------

**The Background**

My buddy /u/medium_mike and I have been running a Fantasy Survivor league of our own creation for the last 30+ seasons. We didn't like the way existing Survivor Fantasy leagues worked so we decided to come up with a point system and management platform that actually rewards good survivor game play. We honestly believe it to be the best format of any other Survivor Fantasy League out there. This site has been built purely out of our own passion for the game as a gift for like-minded fans.

Reddit, we present to you:   
http://tribal-council.com

Registration is free and easy and is actively plugged by us only on /r/survivor. You can even join up to three leagues, public and private! We don't make any money on this site and do it only for fun. But if you love the site, feel free to buy us a cup of coffee. Otherwise, enjoy!


-----------------------------

**The Game**

For those of you who haven't played in past seasons, or for those who need a refresher on the rules, the basic premise is this:

 - You, the player, draft a roster of 8 survivors from this season's list of contestants to be on your team
 - Each week you will put up to 5 of those players on your active roster (scoring points) and leave the rest on your bench (not scoring)
 - During each episode, based on the rules detailed below, your 5 active survivors will (hopefully) earn you points
 - Benched survivors will neither earn you nor cost you points.
 - The goal of the game is to earn more points than anybody else
 - All boiled down, the longer each of your active picks stays in the game and the more challenges they win, the more points they will earn you

-------------------------------

**Roster Management**

Each team consists of 8 survivors, 5 as starters and 3 on the bench. The survivors on your starting roster will score points while benched survivors will not. Once your 8 survivors are drafted and locked in and the season starts you may not add or remove survivors from your roster. You may, and are encouraged to, update which survivors are active and which are benched as many times a week as need be. Roster positions will be locked (usually around 5pm MST) the day that an episode is airing and will be unlocked once the episode is over and new scores have been entered. You'll also be able to completely re-draft your team every time there is a tribe swap or merge in the show.

------------------------------------
**Redrafting**

A redraft is an event that allows you to swap-out any or all of your remaining surviving players with any other survivors in the game. A redraft is always triggered by some event in survivor, as explained below. If you choose not to redraft your team will remain the same as the previous week.

Trigger Events:   
 - the 1st episode (pick all new survivors based on what you saw or keep as many or all of them the same)  
 - after any tribe switch-up (tribes combined / split-up / rocks drawn / new tribes created / or multiple members swapped per tribe)   
 - the merge

It’s about the habit, the little win in your day, that feeling of being a valued regular. So now comes the decision: Do you keep going out of sheer habit, or does this make you rethink?

## Where to Find Legitimate Breville Coupons and Deals

The internet is awash with websites claiming to offer exclusive deals and discounts. However, not all Breville coupons are created equal. Its essential to approach the search with a discerning eye to avoid expired codes, misleading offers, and potential scams. Here's a breakdown of the most reliable places to find legitimate Breville deals:

*   **Breville's Official Website:** Always start your search at the source. Breville periodically offers special offers, seasonal sales, and bundled deals directly on their website.Sign up for their email newsletter to receive exclusive Breville promotional code offers and be the first to know about upcoming promotions and new product releases. Sometimes, Breville offers a first-time signup discount (approximately 10%), as mentioned in some references.

*   **Retailer Websites (Amazon, best Buy, etc.):** Major retailers that carry Breville products frequently enough run their own promotions and discounts, sometimes offering prices lower then Breville's MSRP. Specifically, pay attention to sales events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and seasonal promotions. Search for ""Breville sale"" alongside the retailer's name to quickly identify relevant discounts.

*   **Coupon Websites:** Reputable coupon websites can be a valuable resource, but always proceed with caution. Look for sites that are known for verifying their coupons and have a large user base.

1iyqmzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1iyqmzm/poland_is_alive_pt_2/,Poland is Alive pt 2,"I sat in bed listening to the rush of the town below my apartment building: People yelling, cars honking, babies crying... Hard to believe it was 3 in the morning with how active the streets were. Those who weren't out, were glued to their televisions watching the lastest emergency update. 

For Poland had changed course, and our location was on the ""estimated locations list"". We'd all seen what happens, when Poland climbs it's putrid, amoeba-like country over an area. We'd seen the towns, cities, *countries* completely leveled, from being underneath it. No homes, no grass, no trees. The only time Poland actually didn't change much landscape were those weeks it was stuck in the Sahara desert. 

Now it was coming here. New regulations had the UN, NATO, FEMA, and whatever else, taking the responsibility of helping get all humans out of Polands path. Usually folks had a few days to evacuate. Some only had hours. Some people chose to stay. 

I, myself, truly have stopped caring. *I knew* about this phenomenon at the beginning of April and no one believed me. My research lined up perfectly with that of the seismologists. But I found something else. 

I found...  

A heartbeat...

...and was immediately mocked.

And I get it! It's completely ridiculous for a large piece of earth to suddenly have an even, rhythmic pulse. But that was my job, at the environmental protection agency -to find life in unlikely places- and I was good at it! That's why I was known all around the world.  That's why as soon as things started getting weird in Poland, I showed up to examine things, myself. Except once I made that discovery, they threw me aside. Clearly I had gone bonkers. All because I had some crazy hypothesis and acted on it. 

When I first heard Polands's heart, mine nearly stopped. I called my connections with the UN Security Council, a gave my findings and concerns. I could tell they thought I was nuts, but they humoured me anyway. In the end, they asked what I wanted from them. Of course, I said I needed funding, and a crew to pursue this, and that's when they couldn't hide their laughter anymore. They said I was ridiculous for requesting so much for such an impossible theory. After that, not only did they turn me down, but they dropped all other funding also. 

And so now I lay here. Listening to chaos flow over our little city of Decatur, Illinois. The light of the tv flooding my room, showing the disasters of Poland in real time. 

My phone lights up, and I look to see my old buddy Jeremy calling. Fuck that guy. I let it go to voicemail. He calls two more times before I finally answer. 

""Hello.""

""Dammit, Jordan! Why won't you respond to us?!?""

""Gosh, I mean, I've been so busy. Studying mushrooms, and dragonflies. There's this new show out that covers both of those things along with unicorns and fairies. I mean, I can't afford to actually go out and study *real* ecosystems, since y'all cut my funding-

""Enough!"" Jeremy took a deep breath, trying to calm down, ""Look. We need you. We are willing to admit you were right, and we were wrong. We'll do whatever you want, just please say you'll meet with us, to discuss Poland.""

I thought about it for a few seconds. Maybe I could stand to survive for just a little bit longer. Except... ""I'm in Decatur. I'm right on Poland's path. Unless you can get me out of here, I can't help you.""

""Please, we've had your location for weeks. A chopper is on its way now. Get to your apartment's roof top."" 

Soon I was being flown toward a convention center, states away. Out of Polands's path. For now. 

Landing on the center's rooftop I could see Jeremy, and a few other gentlemen, waiting for me. We didn't shake hands, as I made it to them. They just turned and gestured for me to follow. They all looked exhausted. I forgot it was now probably 4 or 5 in the morning. but who knows how long these men have been up, trying to figure out ways to get Poland under control. 

We made it to a large conference room filled with technology. TV and computer screens lined the walls. Radios and other communication systems covered the desks. There were 6 other people in the room, monitoring specific screens. This must have been the new home base for the security council. 

""Take a seat"" Jeremy said, ""coffee?""

""Oh, yes please"" I responded, casually. 

Another man came and sat by me, and opened a laptop. ""Hello Jordan, my name is Rodney. I'm glad you made it hear safely, but we don't have much time to rest. Here, I have put together a list of everything we need to go over""

Jeremy brought me my coffee as Rodney continued, ""We're going to start at the beginning. When the earthquakes began. That was into the first week of April. A few different crews went out to do research-""

""Like me. Like when I found the heart beat and y'all dismissed me""

""Oh for the love of....just... just shut up, Jordan!"" Jeremy mumbled behind me, while pinching the bridge of his nose. 

Rodney continued, ""By mid-April, we had confirmed that all the quakes took place on the entire border of Poland, and by that time, the edges of the country were separating from the surrounding countries. 

""Also during that time is when Poland started rising in size, and changing it's shape, it caused huge quakes in Lithuania, Belarus, and Germany.

""During the first half of April, we did encourage those living in Poland to evacuate, and while we got a few hundred people out, safely, many didn't believe it was a threat, until it was too late. 

""As soon as Poland had finished rising in elevation and changing shape, it began to move, which was at the beginning of May.

""As we've seen through satellite images, anything Poland moves over is consumed. Lakes dry up, and whole cities disappear. 

""Planes and helicopters, more so, are nearly impossible to fly over Poland while it's moving. Our computers go haywire, causing crashes half the time. We have had a tiny bit of luck, landing aircrafts on the country while it's stopped. But it's nearly impossible to know when Poland will start moving again. Sometimes Poland is stopped for days, weeks, or just hours.""

I held up my hand, ""Has it been tried.... or... So, how about this scenario: we fly a plane onto Poland while it's stopped, with no intention of moving it, until the *next* time it's stopped. Giving people more time to all get to the plane, and more time to fly out of Poland."" 

""It's been tried."" Jeremy looked down and sighed. 

""Well, the news hasn't covered that.""

""Because it failed. It seems Poland can sense large gatherings of humans. We've had completely filled planes, sink down into Poland, right before take-off."" 

Rodney added, ""There have been some rogue pilots who've flown in and out of the country, and  were lucky enough not to be consumed, and also were able to get some people evacuated. But because of the risks, we no longer send large planes over. 

""We can't even get ""plane alerts"" out to the citizens, since they lost power. We've had planes land and stay down for days, with no one showing up.""

We all sat there quietly for a moment. Then Rodney pulled up the next talking point, ""Since Poland started moving, we've seen damage to Ukraine, Russia, down through Pakistan, and into India. The ocean has no affect on it, because next it crossed through Australia, down to New Zealand. 

""That's kind of when we learned that Poland had no strategy to where it went. It did a 180° and headed to Africa, starting down at South Africa, and making it's way north, until it hit the Sahara, and..."" Rodney squinted at his notes, ""that was the end of June. We were both relieved and concerned, because in the desert, Poland got very slow. We thought it may...die? Which would stop all the chaos""

""And the concern?""

""Well, obviously, because it's getting closer to America.""

""I will say, it was a pretty good try, with the nukes while Poland was in the Atlantic.""

Rodney read his notes, ""Yeah, that's next here: While in the Atlantic, it was decided not to nuke Poland, itself, but the water around it, hoping to change the countries course."" 

""Like I said... good try."" I sipped my coffee. 

""So that takes us to now. Poland it making it's way straight through the US."" Rodney closed his laptop. He folded his hands and looked at me. 

I sat there, waiting for more information. ""So..what do you want from me?"" 

Jeremy and Rodney looked at each other and back at me, ""Well. Obviously we we want to stop it. And we're running out of ideas."" 

Rodney added, ""Of course, we don't want to bomb it. Well, we do, but we don't want to hurt the remaining people on the country.""

""Frankly, if there's anyone left on Poland, I think they'd be fine with that."" I chuckled. 

Jeremy sat in the chair on the other side of me. He looked like he was struggling to get words out, ""So... You found a heartbeat.""

""Yes.""

""Which... Of course means it's alive.""

""That's pretty obvious.""

""I'm curious, if you think..."" Jeremy took a deep breath, ""if you think... There's some way to communicate with it.""

I stared at Jeremy, almost not believing what I just heard. I could barely take a breath, before I bursted into laughter. 

The men stayed silent while I laughed. They knew how their question sounded. 

I finally took a breath, ""You guys thought my theory on a heartbeat was crazy, and then you ask me this?? What kind of sense does that even make?! You want to communicate with a piece of land?!"" I was almost angry now.

Jeremy: ""Well what the fuck else are we supposed to do?!"" 

Me: ""It's a fucking country! A bordered piece of land!""

Jeremy: ""You think I don't know that??""

Me: ""It doesn't make sense!""

Jeremy: ""None of this makes sense! We are out of options though!""

Me: ""I actually had proof! Proof of a heartbeat, and *probably* COULD have figured out more about why this fucking country now has an organic anatomy, but YALL shut down my FUNDING!""

Jeremy, ""Oh gosh... Because you sounded CRAZY!""

Rodney broke between us, ""Guys please!"" He walked over to two maps. One of Poland before it changed, and one from after. ""Jordan, do you think you could remember where you were, when you discovered the heartbeat?"" 

I rolled my eyes and walked over to him. ""What are you thinking?"" 

Rodney sighed, ""We have an idea. I don't know if it's the best idea, but like Jeremy said, we're out of options."" 

I looked over at Jeremy, and then back to Rodney. 

""We saw that it struggled in the desert. That means it can feel stress, maybe even pain. And that maybe it can even be killed. If we can pinpoint the heart, perhaps, we can drop just *one* bomb, right over it.""

Now I was pinching my nose bridge, ""You guys know how heartbeats work, right?;"" 

Jeremy and Rodney stared at me. 

""Dropping a bomb over Poland where you hear the heartbeat, would be similar to, if I put a stethoscope to my foot and claimed my heart was there, because I could hear my pulse there.""

Jeremy threw his arms up, ""Why the FUCK did I bring you in?!"" 

""I don't know, Jeremy! You could have *left* me in Poland where I could have actually triangulated the heartbeat! We could have had a lead! Now we have nothing! We have no...."" 

I stared at one screen on the far wall. It was putting X's over every spot on Poland where sinkholes appeared. I walked over to the screen. Were the sink holes random? Or did they have a pattern? 

I looked over at the guys, ""We're going to need more coffee."" 

A tiny smile appeared on Jeremy's face. But it quickly went away as the room started to shake.

Rodney looked to one of the screen watchers, ""Judith, where's Poland's location??"" 

A woman named Judith pulled up satellite images. ""Ugh.... Alaska. Wait. Russia. Oh gosh, it's moving so fast!"" 

""Why's it going so fast??"" Rodney exclaimed.

I quickly sat down at a computer and started calculating. 

""What are you doing?"" Jeremy asked.

""With Poland going so fast, we may have even less time. There's no way we can nuke it, at that speed. But we can be ready, for when it stops again. If it stops again."" 

""And if it doesn't?"" 

I didn't respond. There was no time. I had to hope there was some method to where the sinkholes appeared. ""Judith, please keep an eye of where Poland is"". 

Hours went by. Maybe even days. The vibrations didn't stop. Poland hadn't slowed down. It sped over Russia, to areas north of Canada. It was doing laps around Earth. I couldn't believe we were still alive. 

I was quiet. Measuring distance from sinkhole to sinkhole. Noting the places that weren't affected. And calculating the possibilities of where they could arise. 

""There"" I said. Rodney and Jeremy came to my side, ""There's your Fucking heart!"" Jeremy nearly collapsed on the table. Rodney grabbed my shoulders in a congratulatory fashion. 

""Ok so where's the closest base? Who's still available? What's the next step?"" 

""Guys."" 

We all looked over at Judith. 

""It's. It's coming."" 

My heart sank. Would this all have been for nothing? 

All of us in the room looked at each other and appeared to have the same thing on our mind. There was no stopping Poland. And there wasn't enough time to evacuate.

I ran out of the room.

""Where are you going Jordan??"" Jeremy followed me out. Soon everyone was following, as I climbed the stairs to the roof top. 

Up on the roof, panting, I scanned the area, spinning until I saw the direction where I knew Poland would be coming from. 

There it was. Who knows how far it was, but I could see it's disastrous wreckage. The smoke and dust filling the skyline. 

Everyone stood around me. Some people holding each other, others silently staring. There was nothing to do but watch, until we were also absorbed by Poland.

There wasn't even time to recall my fondest memories. My childhood. My family. 

There was only Poland. 

""It's getting closer!"" Another woman sobbed into Judith's arms. 

But then something happened. As the building shook harder... as Poland got closer....

It lifted off the ground. 

What were we witnessing?? 

I fell to my knees, as I saw the large country literally take flight.

""My God..."" Rodney gasped. 

We watched. 

We watched it get higher. 

And higher. 

Until it was above the sky. 

Above the atmosphere. 

Poland was in space. 

After MONTHS of causing chaos all over the planet...

Poland was gone. 


2 months later...

Poland is moving. 

Actually Poland hadn't stopped moving. Ever since it jumped off of Earth, it has been chugging along in space, passing other planets. People who survived Poland, have all come together to build small, close communities. Slowly, life will become normal again. 

""Jordan, are you still here?"" I heard a voice call from down the hall. Of course I knew who it was, and didn't respond. Jeremy popped his head into the conference room. He scanned over the dark room, until he saw me, lit up by a computer screen, in the back corner.  

Quietly he came and sat be me. He cleared his throat, ""Jordan. I'm concerned.""

I didn't look away from the screen. 

""You've been up here, by yourself for weeks now. Poland's been declared 'not a threat' to the planet for a whole month. Please, get up. Come stay with me. Come see how we've rebuilt some cities."" 

I sighed and looked over at him, ""Not yet.""

Jeremy, eyes were sad, ""...I'll be back tomorrow. Please try and get some decent sleep."" As he stood up, he dropped a bag of food on the desk. 

He was a good friend. But I had to stay here. I had to make sure Poland didn't return. I stared at different windows on my screen. One showing earth, one showing emergency updates from all around the world, and one that sent updated images on where Poland was in space. 

I had to keep watching. 

I had to make sure. 

Poland wasn't dead. It was just gone. 

But if it came back, I knew how to kill it. 

So for now, I'll just keep watch.

As a left hander, I am sometimes slightly sad that holding in my left hand means I don't get to see the wonderful brain art as often as I'd like, but that is a very harsh nitpick.

However, I do have one actual criticism arising from a surprising technical oversight. The handle is high enough on the body of the mug that a V60 dripper does not sit flat on the mug when brewing!

The evening of February 26, 2025, started like any other in London—grey, damp, and restless. Streetlights buzzed to life as dusk bled into night, casting their sickly yellow glow over wet cobblestones and the hurried steps of commuters. Then, at 7:13 p.m., it happened. A low, guttural hum rolled through the air, rattling windows and vibrating up through the soles of boots. Every light—every bulb, every screen, every glowing sign—snuffed out in unison. The United Kingdom plunged into darkness.

For a moment, there was silence. A collective holding of breath. Then the screams began.

#### The Flat Falls

In a cramped flat in Brixton, Mia Carter jolted awake on her sagging sofa, the TV’s sudden blackout cutting off the reality show she’d been half-watching. Her tabby cat, Pickles, hissed and bolted under the coffee table. Mia rubbed her eyes, groaning. “Bloody power cuts again,” she muttered, fumbling for her phone. The screen was dead. Not dim, not low-battery—dead. She tapped it, shook it, cursed at it. Nothing.

Outside, a car alarm wailed, then another. She staggered to the window, peeling back the grimy curtain. The street below was a void—no streetlights, no headlights, no faint glow from neighboring windows. Just black. A shiver crawled up her spine as a shout echoed up from the pavement. “Oi! What’s going on?!” a man bellowed, his voice cracking with panic. Glass shattered somewhere close, a brittle explosion that made Mia flinch.

She wasn’t alone. Her younger brother, Jace, burst out of his room, all lanky limbs and wild blond hair, clutching a cricket bat. “Mia, you hear that? Sounds like the world’s ending out there!” His voice trembled, but his hazel eyes glinted with a manic kind of excitement.

“Calm down, you nutter,” she snapped, though her own heart was hammering. “It’s just a blackout. Probably some twat at the power station spilled tea on the controls.”

Jace snorted, but the sound was drowned out by a scream—high-pitched, raw, and far too close. Mia’s stomach dropped. She grabbed a kitchen knife from the counter, its dull blade glinting faintly in the moonlight spilling through the window. “Stay behind me,” she ordered, shoving past Jace toward the door. She cracked it open, peering into the hallway.

The building was a tomb. No emergency lights, no hum of the ancient lift. Just shadows and the distant thud of footsteps—too fast, too frantic. Then, a guttural roar erupted from the stairwell, followed by a wet, ripping sound that turned Mia’s knees to jelly. She slammed the door shut, fumbling with the deadbolt. “Jace, barricade it! Now!”

He didn’t argue, dragging the sofa across the chipped linoleum with a screech. “What the hell was that?” he wheezed, piling a chair on top for good measure. “Sounded like—like something eating someone!”

“Don’t be daft,” Mia said, but her voice shook. She pressed her ear to the door. Silence, thick and suffocating, pressed back. Then—scratching. Slow, deliberate, like nails dragging down wood. Her breath hitched. “Get to the window. We’re climbing out.”

Jace gaped at her. “You mad? We’re three floors up!”

“You wanna stay here with whatever’s out there?” she hissed, shoving the knife into her waistband. The scratching grew louder, joined by a low, guttural snarl that didn’t sound human. Mia didn’t wait for an answer. She yanked the window open, cold air blasting her face as she scanned the fire escape. Rusty, rickety, but it’d have to do.

The door shuddered behind them, wood splintering under a heavy blow. “Move!” Mia screamed, shoving Jace toward the window. He scrambled out, the metal groaning under his weight. She followed, heart pounding as the door buckled inward with a deafening crack. A shape loomed in the gap—tall, hunched, its eyes glinting like wet coins in the dark. It let out a shriek that clawed at her eardrums, all teeth and rage.

Mia didn’t look back. She leapt onto the fire escape, the rungs biting into her palms as she half-climbed, half-fell after Jace. The street below was chaos—cars abandoned with doors flung open, figures running, stumbling, screaming. A woman in a torn coat sprinted past, only to be yanked back into the shadows by something fast and sinewy. Her scream cut off with a gurgle.

“Oh God, oh God,” Jace whimpered, clinging to the railing. “What’s happening, Mia?”

“I don’t know!” she shouted, dragging him down the last ladder. Her boots hit the pavement, slick with something dark and sticky. Blood. A lot of it. She gagged, pulling Jace toward an alley. “We need to hide. Now.”

---

#### Teeth in the Night

The alley reeked of rot and piss, a narrow throat of brick and overflowing bins. Mia pressed herself against the wall, Jace trembling beside her. The air pulsed with distant cries, punctuated by the crunch of breaking glass and the occasional guttural howl that made her skin crawl. She tightened her grip on the knife, its handle slick with sweat.

“Stay quiet,” she whispered, her breath fogging in the frigid air. Jace nodded, clutching the cricket bat like a lifeline. His wide eyes darted toward the alley’s mouth, where the street glowed faintly with the orange flicker of a fire—someone’s car, torched in the madness.

A shadow slunk past the entrance, low and predatory. Mia held her breath, watching its silhouette—too long, too jagged to be human. It paused, head tilting as if sniffing the air, then vanished with a skittering scrape of claws on asphalt. She exhaled shakily. “What the hell was that?”

“Dunno,” Jace whispered back, voice barely audible. “But it ain’t friendly.”

They needed a plan. The flat was compromised, the street a warzone. Mia’s mind raced. “The Tube,” she said suddenly. “Brixton station’s close. Underground might be safer.”

“With those things out here?” Jace’s voice cracked. “You’re off your rocker!”

“You got a better idea?” she shot back, glaring at him. He didn’t. “Then shut it and follow me.”

They edged along the wall, every step a gamble. The alley opened onto a side street littered with debris—shattered shop windows, overturned bins, a bicycle bent in half like a child’s toy. A body lay sprawled near a lamppost, its chest torn open, glistening ropes of intestine spilling onto the pavement. Jace retched, clapping a hand over his mouth. Mia forced herself to look away, bile burning her throat.

The station was two blocks east. Two blocks of hell. They darted from shadow to shadow, ducking behind cars and bins as shapes moved in the periphery—hulking, skittering things that defied description. One paused atop a van, its head swiveling toward them, eyes like twin moons in a skull too narrow to be natural. Mia yanked Jace down behind a dumpster, her pulse a drumbeat in her ears.

“Don’t move,” she breathed. The thing’s head cocked, a low clicking sound emanating from its throat. Then it leapt, vanishing into the dark. Mia waited, counting to ten, before pulling Jace up. “Run.”

They bolted, legs pumping, lungs burning. The station loomed ahead, its entrance a black maw framed by tiled arches. A crowd had gathered there earlier—panicked commuters, maybe—but now it was silent, save for the drip of something wet echoing from within. Mia slowed, unease prickling her scalp. “Jace, wait—”

Too late. He skidded to a stop just inside, and a hand shot out of the darkness, claw-like fingers wrapping around his ankle. He screamed, swinging the bat wildly as a figure lurched into view—pale, eyeless, its mouth a gaping slash of jagged teeth. Mia lunged, driving her knife into its neck. Black ichor spurted, hot and sticky, as it shrieked and released Jace, thrashing like a wounded animal.

“Get up!” she yelled, hauling him to his feet. The thing writhed, its cries drawing more shadows from the depths of the station. Mia didn’t think—she grabbed Jace and ran back into the street, the sound of pursuit clawing at their heels.

---

#### The Streets Bleed

The night was alive, and it hated them. Mia dragged Jace through the chaos, weaving between wrecked cars and bodies—some still twitching, others eerily still. A man staggered toward them, blood streaming from a gash across his face. “Help me!” he croaked, reaching out. Before Mia could react, a shape dropped from a rooftop, landing on him with a sickening crunch. Bones snapped like dry twigs as the thing tore into him, its elongated limbs flailing with grotesque precision.

Jace screamed, and Mia clamped a hand over his mouth, pulling him into a shattered shopfront. The air inside stank of spilled booze and copper. Broken bottles crunched underfoot as she shoved Jace behind the counter. “Stay down,” she hissed, peering over the edge.

The creature outside feasted, its head buried in the man’s chest, ripping out chunks of flesh with wet, slurping sounds. Its skin was mottled grey, stretched tight over a frame that was all angles and spines. Mia’s stomach churned, but she couldn’t look away. Not until it lifted its head, blood dripping from its maw, and turned those moonlit eyes toward the shop.

“Oh, shit,” she breathed, ducking down. The counter trembled as something heavy landed on it, claws clicking against the wood. Jace whimpered, and Mia pressed a finger to her lips, her other hand tightening around the knife. The thing’s breathing was ragged, wet, inches above them. A clawed hand swiped down, missing Jace’s head by a hair.

Mia didn’t think. She sprang up, driving the knife into its side. The blade sank deep, and the creature howled, thrashing wildly. She yanked it free, black blood spraying across her face as she stabbed again, and again, until it slumped off the counter with a thud, twitching in a pool of its own filth.

Jace stared at her, wide-eyed. “You—you killed it!”

“Barely,” she panted, wiping the ichor from her eyes. “There’s more. We can’t stay here.”

They stumbled out, the street now a battlefield. Fires burned in the distance, casting flickering shadows over scenes of carnage—people fleeing, fighting, dying. A group of men armed with bats and pipes clashed with a pack of the creatures, their shouts drowned out by shrieks and the crunch of breaking bones. Mia didn’t stop to watch. She pulled Jace toward a side street, her mind locked on one goal: survival.

---

#### The Church of the Damned

They ran until their lungs burned, ducking into a derelict church on the edge of Brixton. Its steeple loomed crooked against the moonlit sky, windows shattered, doors hanging off their hinges. Inside, the air was thick with dust and the faint tang of decay. Pews lay overturned, hymnals scattered like fallen leaves. Mia barricaded the door with a pew, her hands shaking.

Jace collapsed against the altar, gasping. “What are those things, Mia? Where’d they come from?”

“I don’t know,” she said, scanning the shadows. “But they’re everywhere. Like the dark let ‘em loose.”

A noise—soft, skittering—came from the rafters. Mia froze, raising the knife. “Jace, get behind me.”

He scrambled up, bat trembling in his hands. “You hear that?”

“Yeah,” she whispered. The skittering grew louder, joined by a low, rhythmic clicking. Then, from the darkness above, a shape dropped—smaller than the others, but faster, its limbs a blur as it lunged at Jace. He swung the bat, catching it mid-air with a crack. It hit the floor, twitching, its eyeless face snapping toward them.

Mia stomped its head, her boot crunching through bone and sinew. “There’s more!” she shouted as shadows shifted above. Three more leapt down, their claws gouging the wooden floor. Mia slashed at one, opening a gash across its chest, while Jace swung wildly, knocking another back. The third lunged at Mia, its teeth snapping inches from her throat. She drove the knife up through its jaw, pinning its mouth shut as it thrashed and died.

Jace panted, blood splattered across his face. “We can’t keep this up!”

“We don’t have a choice!” she yelled, kicking the last creature off her blade. But he was right. They were exhausted, outnumbered. The church wasn’t safe.

A crash echoed from the door—the barricade splintering under heavy blows. Mia’s heart sank. “They found us.”

---

#### The Last Stand

The door exploded inward, and a tide of creatures poured through—tall ones, small ones, all teeth and claws and hunger. Mia and Jace backed toward the altar, trapped. “Mia, what do we do?!” Jace’s voice was a sob.

“Fight,” she said, gripping the knife. “Till we can’t.”

They came fast, a blur of grey and black. Mia slashed and stabbed, her arms burning, blood and ichor coating her hands. Jace swung the bat, cracking skulls and breaking limbs, but there were too many. One latched onto his leg, dragging him down. He screamed, flailing as its claws tore into his calf.

“No!” Mia roared, diving at it, plunging the knife into its spine. It spasmed and fell, but another took its place, slamming her against the altar. Pain exploded through her ribs as its claws raked her side. She stabbed blindly, feeling the blade sink into flesh, and it collapsed, pinning her beneath its weight.

Jace crawled toward her, blood streaming from his leg. “Mia, get up!”

She shoved the corpse off, gasping, and pulled him to his feet. The creatures circled, their clicking growing louder, a chorus of death. Mia’s vision blurred, her strength fading. “I’m sorry, Jace,” she whispered. “I tried.”

A new sound cut through the chaos—a deep, resonant boom, like a horn. The creatures froze, heads snapping toward the door. Then, as one, they fled, skittering out into the night. Mia and Jace stood there, bleeding, trembling, alone.

“What… what was that?” Jace rasped.

Mia shook her head, too tired to guess. Dawn was breaking, a faint grey light seeping through the shattered windows. The night was over. But the nightmare? That was just beginning.

If I were her I’d be so freaked out and nervous if I saw an entire Reddit page discovering my new boyfriend/situationship whatever the case. Not saying it’s not a normal thing that will happen when you’re a public figure and people in your life publicly post photos of you, but I think she got scared and anxious from everyone finding out so much private shit from her life so soon.

Considering how many situationships / talking stages she’s alluded to over the years on YouTube, it’s crazy that no one’s ever found out who these men are and no one from ASU has even pieced anything together. I remember she even used to post those grwms in her old Arizona apartment in senior year and they’d be like “grwm to have coffee with a boy” or “grwm to go to a basketball game with a boy” and she seemed a little more comfortable sharing that stuff. I even remember she once had to put out a disclaimer after making a tiktok in college about being in a group project with her crush, and she backtracked after and said “please stop commenting and asking about it because he’s gonna see these comments on my TikTok and Instagram”

Anyways, I feel for her because I think I’d be super anxious and sick to my stomach if I was as private as her and suddenly people were commenting all over my socials about my boyfriend and finding his photos / making tiktoks and Reddit posts about it. I’m not saying what’s happening on here is insane for an influencer, I just think I understand why she’s reacting this way and maybe even resenting social media because of it. This relationship could be really new and she might be scared this reaction from her followers will scare the guy off

With all that said I think what everyone is saying is right, and she’s feeding into this weird mysterious element by not posting… she could post any sort of content, not specifically vlog content, if she was feeling a little weird talking to the camera about her life currently. By not posting at all she’s making it worse and she already complains enough about her insanely easy “job” that takes 0 effort, and this type of energy from her is gonna make her community plummet asap (besides her patreon freaks who believe they’re her besties)",4,1740584700.0,stephbohrersnark,5,1.0,False

I believe I am over half way through my 35 treatments. I suffer from severe depression, anxiety, and PTSD. My psychiatrist has made recent comments about ADHD but I do not have a diagnosis. Since starting I have had absolutely insane nightmares. I am awake for however many hours during the day, and a night I feel like I walk through hell for 20+ hours. They are extremely vivid and always negative; I have no happy dreams since starting TMS. If I think about anything twice during my day while I’m awake, it shows up in my nightmares in hell version that night. It’s really seeping into my mood during the day, especially because some of the nightmare content is really disturbing. Apart from that, I am very fatigued from treatment and usually need a long nap every afternoon or I’ll be pissed. The headaches are severe, although they were worse at the beginning of treatment. I wake up with migraines, so I purchased a mouthguard because I am grinding my teeth from head pain, nightmares, or both during the night. I also feel more depressed and anxious, and DEFINITELY irritable. My mood is ruined by very small triggers, like a barista that was whistling a little too loud the other day while making coffee. If my boyfriend tries to help me clean the house but does something slightly outside of my cleaning routine, I struggle to keep my temper. This is not normal for me; I am usually happy and grateful that anyone is helping even in their own way. Apart from TMS, I do weekly talk therapy, weekly EMDR therapy, and daily AA meetings (I work with a sponsor too). Myself, my therapist, my psychiatrist, and my loved ones are concerned that this treatment is causing more harm than good. I have had little to no improvements in my mood; in fact I would say it’s worse. The nightmares are absolutely insane. Is it supposed to get better? Will I get some wave of good symptoms after finishing treatment? I truly do not know what to do anymore; I’m wondering if I should finish the treatments or not. I can’t seem to get much information about TMS from my psychiatrist, therapist, the administering clinic, or the internet. I feel like a human guinea pig as no one seems to know how this treatment actually works. ",1,1740584680.0,TMSTherapy,0,1.0,False

I bought my first own car in the corona pandemic. A 2005 E90 N52B25 325i 6 gear manual in 475 Sapphire Black metallic, xenon headlights, heated seats and with 177.000 km. It was in a rough shape but I made a good deal. The 3rd gear was not working properly (literally shaved 20gr of metal everytime I threw it in) but no other motor codes whatsoever.

[OEM look is king](https://preview.redd.it/1u7ghjhf5ile1.jpg?width=2160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b9d1c4a9bc1fcc3004bc38746a46b835ccd74c2)

  
My first to do: Switch to OEM tail lights. I did not like the transparent ones. I am generally a fan of the OEM look. I even dislike the 17"" Borbet rims, although many ppl think that they aren't even half bad lookwise.

Then the first ever ""tuning"" experience: Spraying the radiator covers, which are two parts in pre-LCI models with the first can I found in the garage. I did not like the M-Colors on the grill and not being a genuine M-Model.

[Not as pretty as I thought](https://preview.redd.it/du4839vj5ile1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0461682cf3fe22356964112fd1334fb4f7a25d79)

Summer was around the corner and I literally made a good deal with buying my most favorite rims that I seeked out for a long time. BMW 313 19"" for a really good price. The tires were worn down but this was no concern at first. I later bought new Bridgestone Potzena 225/35 F 255/30 B. In my opinion, the best model for this rims is the E93 followed by the E92 but it still looked really nice.

[17\\"" Borbet with winter tires](https://preview.redd.it/1xlk0l5u5ile1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=4afbdad908b65ef358f00835a6ea88e4b50f3e4f)

I was really hyped, just like a kid. As I put on the new rims, the cycle of never being 100% satisfied with a car begun. The rims were in top shape but man, having stock suspension really bugged me. So after researching I chose Bilstein B8 suspension and H&R coils (30/20mm). I also bought new ball and strut bearings.

[m346 putting them together](https://preview.redd.it/jmo2qeoz5ile1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=6944a6848e5e3344ca63071bcd88e46a6f9e5360)

Meanwhile I bought the M-sport fender all around, grill bars that I painted blue together with the brake calipers and smoke fog lights. Assembling the car together and the perfect summer look was ready. I did not like how innocent the headlights looked, so I opted for a ""Böser Blick"" (tl: menacing stare/look)- really don't know how you guys call it in english. I changed the angel eyes to powerful ones with 15w but the price for that was not worth it. I also added Eibach Plates 10mm to the front and already had 20mm for the rear.

[First time that I couldn't believe my eyes](https://preview.redd.it/ch2eiq126ile1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a82fd2924f47f91ccdc8fa08ad459421db6743a)

The view from the front and side was amazing. I just needed to upgrade my tail lights because they really looked old. The OEM options were not nice imo and at that time, I did not know that you could upgrade it to LCI headlights with some tweaks, so I bought OEM+ ones

[A child of the BMW 1 Coupe & E90 LCI tail lights is born](https://preview.redd.it/0nl2h5166ile1.png?width=937&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd3d30abaaa5ae1ee409097a1fd50f127829f3b0)

I almost exclusively focused on the exterior of my car, completely neglecting the interior. I opted for an alcantara look for the dashboard and bought a new steering wheel matching the blue of my grill bars and brakes.

The gear knob was a tough one. I bought the OEM knob + bellow for a hefty price but I got one of the best photos my phone has ever made.

[OEM knob and leather bellow](https://preview.redd.it/tcxfv4fb6ile1.jpg?width=2877&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df0b4f9783e2af7f67c78141651d60632d876c6d)

For a while I was really happy with my car and learned a lot of basics regarding it. Here and there I bought some small things like a Pipercross Filter for a rougher sound (small but noticable sound change). But the tour does not end here.

After discussing it in forums and checking the possibilities I decided to go for the LCI look. Again, bought a M-Sport front fender and found a really cheap LCI bonnet already having the right paint. I also had to buy a new grill because with LCI its now just one part instead of two. I also found a minimalistic rear spoiler that I really liked.

New M-look mirror caps completed the final look. I was really happy that I chose to undergo the LCI transformation and I only can recommend it to all pre-LCI owners.

As I was working out in the sun, I noticed all the swirls in the paint. Doing a paint correction/polish was very expensive and I thought: Why not do it your self?

So I ordered everything I needed and washed my car, removed rust or tiny spots with clay, covered all sensible parts with tape, did a three step polish which took me quite some time and broke my back in half. After the polish I sealed the paint with a two layer hybric ceramic. I also did little paint correction with a special little pin and pen.

Here I really got humbled. Paint work is a very hard thing to do. I fully respect all of you doing this and earning money off of it and in retrospect I now know why you guys want a good buck for this work.

And this was the complete styling journey of my car. I really really learned a lot, especially the importance of not spending too much money on your car... and maybe looking for used parts because I does not always have to be brand new.

My engine eventually broke down because of missed oil changes. I already had to put in 1l per 1000km but refilling oil is not the same as chaning it. That caused hydro problems and the repair was just too expensive so I bought a used N25B30 with 258bhp previously from an 630i and we replaced it together with a fresh gasket cover and some other things that you should always replace in a bigger task like this.

I would always recommend a 330i over a 325i. Much more power on lower rpm.

Was it expensive? Yes  
Was it worth it? It depends. I really learned a lot about cars, especially mine. For me, a clear yes.  
Do I plan further upgrades? Yes, like a new sound system, new headlights I already bought and god forbid a supercharger from Infinitas but I will never have the money for it. They plan to release one for the N52 engines, so stay tuned.  
Would I do it again? **100%.**

I hope this post can be an inspiration for everybody, a spark for those who lost it and a nice to read while drinking a coffee.

1iyqdhd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFitStories/comments/1iyqdhd/the_genius_wave_i_tried_it_for_2_weeksheres_what/,The Genius Wave: I Tried It for 2 Weeks—Here’s What Happened,"I’ve always been curious about ways to improve focus and creativity—without relying on endless cups of coffee. When I came across The Genius Wave, an audio-based program that claims to enhance brain function through sound frequencies, I wasn’t sure what to expect. Some people swear by brainwave entrainment, while others think it’s just hype. So, I decided to try it out for two weeks and share my honest experience.

**What is The Genius Wave?**

It’s a collection of audio tracks designed to stimulate specific brainwave states. The idea is that by listening to these frequencies, your brain naturally synchronizes with them, helping with focus, relaxation, and even creativity. It’s similar to binaural beats but claims to be more advanced.

[The Genius Wave](https://preview.redd.it/v0t1w1d07ile1.png?width=826&format=png&auto=webp&s=9febfb8a362929a0ffeca8ed3c4f23901cfc86df)

**Here’s how it works:**

You listen through headphones (important for the effect).

Different tracks target focus, relaxation, or stress relief.

Over time, your brain adapts to these frequencies, making it easier to reach deep focus or relaxation states.

**My Experience with The Genius Wave**

Week 1: Easing Into It

I started listening to the focus tracks during my morning work sessions. At first, it felt like background noise, but by day three, I noticed something—I was getting into a flow state faster. Tasks that usually took an hour were done in 40-45 minutes. It wasn’t a dramatic change, but it was noticeable.

Week 2: Unexpected Benefits

By the second week, I added the relaxation tracks before bed. Normally, my mind races at night, but I felt calmer and fell asleep faster. Another thing I noticed? My usual afternoon brain fog was much less noticeable. It’s hard to say if it was entirely The Genius Wave, but I wasn’t complaining.

**What I Liked**

✅ Helped me focus better, especially on deep work.✅ Super easy to use—just listen and let it work.✅ Relaxation tracks were surprisingly effective.

**What I Didn’t Like**

❌ You have to commit—results aren’t instant.❌ Requires headphones, so no casual listening.❌ Pricey—might not be for everyone.

**Final Thoughts**

If you struggle with focus, stress, or creative blocks, The Genius Wave might be worth exploring. It’s not an overnight miracle, but over time, I did feel improvements in concentration and relaxation. That said, everyone’s experience will be different.

Have any of you tried something similar? Did it work for you? I’d love to hear your thoughts.

1iyq7qd,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1iyq7qd/struggling_with_sr800_roasting_need_guidance_on/,Struggling with SR800 Roasting – Need Guidance on Stage Transitions,"Hey everyone,

I'm looking for some help with my roasting process. I'm using an SR800 with an extension tube, but despite watching numerous videos from Captain’s Coffee and others, I still don't feel comfortable using the roaster.

I've already roasted about 3kg of green beans across different batches and techniques, but only about 1kg turned out enjoyable. My last roast went really bad because I was just replicating video steps, but my beans behave differently compared to the instructions.

I understand the three main stages of coffee roasting: drying, the Maillard phase, and first crack (also development). However, I’m struggling with progressing smoothly through these stages. For example, I know some people start at F9 and then lower the fan to increase heat, but I’m unsure how to transition properly.

My biggest question is: how do I know when to move to the next stage? When my beans turn yellow, what should I expect? How do I ensure a smooth transition into the Maillard phase, and more importantly, into first crack?

Also, what are the key fan and heat adjustments needed to reach first crack? Should I lower the fan step by step at specific intervals? I know development times vary—30-50 seconds for a light roast and 60-80 seconds for a medium roast—but getting to those points correctly is my main challenge.",2,1740584027.0,roasting,6,0.75,False
1iyq7ki,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1iyq7ki/explore_the_kismile_espresso_machine_and_grinder/,Explore the Kismile Espresso Machine and Grinder Review: Is It Worth Adding to Your Kitchen?,"Testing out the Kismile Espresso Machine with Grinder has been an adventure for my taste buds and my kitchen routine. As someone who treasures the comfort of a rich espresso in the morning, this machine piqued my curiosity. It’s marketed as a professional-grade, 20-bar automatic espresso maker equipped with a grinder and a milk frother. Promising café-quality coffee at home, it’s a sleek addition to any kitchen setup. After putting it to the test for weeks, I’ve discovered a mix of fantastic features and a few quirks.

**Design & Build Quality**

Right out of the box, this espresso machine feels substantial and well-constructed. The stainless steel design lends a polished appearance that complements my countertop perfectly. Its compact dimensions ensure it doesn’t dominate the space, which is perfect for my smaller kitchen. While the machine weighs about 20.5 pounds, making it sturdy, it’s not so heavy that moving it would be a hassle. The buttons and controls are intuitive, but the grinder dial could have been a tad smoother to operate. Still, the build quality gives confidence in its durability.

**Coffee Quality**

The first time I brewed a shot, I was genuinely impressed. The 20-bar Italian pressure pump does a stellar job extracting every ounce of flavor from the coffee grounds. I experimented with different beans, from dark roasts to light blends, and the results consistently delivered a rich crema that rivaled my favorite café. Once, I even surprised a friend with a latte, and they couldn’t believe it came from a home machine. That said, I found that dialing in the grinder settings was essential to achieve the best results, which might intimidate beginners.

[Check Kismile Espresso Machine and Grinder price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dfyj2mx5/)

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**

Using the steam wand was a game-changer. It produces creamy, velvety foam that elevates lattes and cappuccinos to barista-level quality. I’ve tried both dairy and oat milk, and the results were equally delightful. The dual-purpose wand also doubles as a hot water dispenser, which I appreciated for making Americanos or even tea. However, the steam pressure isn’t strong enough to froth milk while pulling a shot simultaneously, which could be a minor inconvenience for those in a rush.

**Features**

One standout feature is the built-in conical burr grinder, offering 30 preset grind settings. This allowed me to experiment with grind sizes to find the perfect texture for various coffee styles. The machine’s PID temperature control ensured consistent brewing, maintaining accuracy within 30°F. I also loved the single and double shot options—perfect for customizing my coffee strength depending on the day. The removable drip tray accommodates larger mugs, which is a nice touch for those who prefer bigger servings.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**

Keeping this machine clean is straightforward, which is always a plus. The removable water tank and drip tray make emptying and refilling hassle-free. The included cleaning tools, like the needle for the steam nozzle, are thoughtful additions that came in handy. One morning, I forgot to clean the steam wand after use, and although it took a bit more effort to unclog, the cleaning brush made it manageable. Still, regular upkeep is essential to keep the machine running smoothly.

**Water Tank & Capacity**

The 2.8-liter water tank is generous for home use. I’ve gone days without needing a refill, even with multiple cups brewed daily. The tank is easy to remove and fits snugly back into place. However, its placement at the back of the machine might be inconvenient for some, especially if you have limited counter space and need to pull the machine forward to access it.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**

Noise is minimal, which was a pleasant surprise. Early morning coffees no longer risk waking up the household. The machine heats up quickly, saving time and energy. I also appreciate that it automatically powers off after a period of inactivity—great for someone like me who occasionally forgets to turn off appliances.

**Advantages**

* Built-in grinder with 30 grind settings enhances coffee customization.
* Produces rich, café-quality espresso with a strong crema.
* Milk frother creates creamy, velvety foam for lattes and cappuccinos.
* Sturdy stainless steel design with an intuitive interface.
* Large water tank that’s easy to clean and refill.

**Drawbacks**

* Steam wand can’t operate simultaneously with espresso brewing.
* Grinder dial might feel slightly stiff for some users.
* Water tank placement may be challenging in tight spaces.
* Requires a learning curve to optimize settings for the best brew.

**Competing Products**

Comparing this espresso maker to alternatives like the Breville Barista Express and De’Longhi La Specialista reveals a few interesting points. While the Breville model boasts a more robust grinder and a faster heat-up time, it comes at a steeper price. The De’Longhi machine offers advanced auto-frothing but lacks some of the manual control that the Kismile provides. What sets this espresso maker apart is its balance of affordability, functionality, and design. For someone like me who values quality without breaking the bank, it’s a worthy contender.

**True Value**

Considering the features and performance of this machine, it offers excellent value for its price. While it may not have the advanced automation of higher-end models, its customizable settings and reliable build make it a strong choice for home baristas. It’s ideal for anyone wanting to elevate their coffee game without spending a fortune. The learning curve is worth it for the results you can achieve.

1iyq7ka,https://www.reddit.com/r/wirelessearbudsreview/comments/1iyq7ka/evaluate_the_best_wireless_earbuds_sennheiser/,Evaluate the best wireless earbuds Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 2 review: Are they worth it?,"Having spent weeks with the Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 2, I can confidently share my experience. These earbuds are designed for those who demand premium sound quality and a sleek aesthetic. As someone who uses earbuds daily for work calls, workouts, and casual music listening, I found these to be a mixed bag of impressive features and a few quirks.

**Design & Build Quality**

The craftsmanship on these earbuds stands out immediately. The charging case has a fabric cover that feels luxurious and durable, though it could pick up dirt over time. The earbuds themselves have a modern, minimalist design with a matte finish that resists fingerprints. Their slightly bulky size may be noticeable for users with smaller ears, but they don’t feel overly heavy. The touch-sensitive controls are intuitive, allowing for play, pause, and volume adjustments, which worked seamlessly during my testing.

**Noise Cancellation & Ambient Mode**

The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is decent but doesn’t quite reach the level of market leaders like Sony or Bose. While commuting, it managed to dull the low hum of engines but struggled with sharper, unpredictable noises like honking. The transparency mode, however, impressed me. It allowed outside sounds to filter through naturally, making it easy to hold quick conversations without removing the earbuds. I appreciated this feature while grabbing my morning coffee at a noisy café.

[Check Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 2 price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b084zlf1th/)

**Sound Quality & Performance**

The audio is undeniably the highlight. Sennheiser's 7mm dynamic drivers deliver a balanced sound profile with deep bass, clear mids, and sparkling treble. I tested them on a wide range of genres—from jazz to hip-hop—and they consistently impressed. Watching movies felt immersive, and I even caught subtle background details in tracks I’d heard a hundred times before. The customizable equalizer in the Smart Control app lets you tweak the sound to your liking, which audiophiles will appreciate.

**Fit & Comfort**

Comfort-wise, they performed admirably. The earbuds come with multiple ear tip sizes, so I was able to find a snug fit that stayed secure during walks and light workouts. However, they weren't perfect for intense gym sessions. Sweat made them slightly slippery, and they occasionally needed adjustment. If you're looking for earbuds primarily for sports, these might not be your best bet.

**Battery Life & Charging**

Battery life is solid, offering seven hours of playback on a single charge and an additional 28 hours with the case. I never found myself scrambling for a charger, even during long workdays or flights. Charging the case takes around 1.5 hours, which is acceptable, though fast-charging enthusiasts might wish for quicker options.

**Durability & Water Resistance**

With an IPX4 rating, these earbuds are resistant to splashes and light rain, making them suitable for everyday use and short outdoor runs. However, I’d hesitate to use them in heavy downpours or extremely sweaty workouts. The build feels sturdy, and the case has survived a couple of accidental drops without issue.

**Warranty**

The product comes with a two-year warranty, which gives some peace of mind, especially given the premium price tag. I haven’t had the chance to test Sennheiser's customer service, but online reviews suggest mixed experiences.

**Pros**

* Immersive sound quality with customizable EQ
* Sleek and premium design
* Reliable battery life with extended case charge
* Effective transparency mode

**Cons**

* ANC falls short compared to top competitors
* Slightly bulky design for smaller ears
* Limited suitability for intense workouts
* Lacks multipoint connectivity

**Competing Products**

When compared to alternatives like the Sony WF-1000XM4 or the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, the Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 2 holds its ground in sound quality but lags in noise cancellation and comfort for prolonged use. Sony offers superior ANC and multipoint Bluetooth connectivity, while Bose excels in comfort and call quality. AirPods Pro might appeal to those embedded in Apple’s ecosystem, offering seamless device switching and spatial audio.

**Value Proposition**

The Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 2 sits in the premium price range, and while it delivers incredible sound quality, its lack of standout ANC and multipoint connectivity might make some hesitate. For audiophiles prioritizing sound over features, it’s a worthy investment. Budget-conscious buyers, however, might find similar audio performance in slightly less expensive models.

Procrastination can delay promotions, hamper deliveries and even impede professional growth. If you feel like you could be getting more done at work, here are 5 strategies to increase your productivity and avoid procrastination:

1️⃣ Start with what generates the most impact
If you're having trouble getting started, choose the task that will bring the most results to your career. It's often what we avoid, but it's what matters most.

2️⃣ Use the 2 minute rule
If something takes less than 2 minutes to do, do it now! Replying to a quick email or organizing a small task avoids backlogs that drain your productivity.

3️⃣ Break big tasks into small steps
Long projects can be demotivating. Break it down into smaller steps and short deadlines. This facilitates progress and reduces feelings of overwhelm.

4️⃣ Eliminate distractions at work
Turn off unnecessary notifications, block websites that steal your attention, and set specific time periods for emails and meetings. An organized environment helps you stay focused.

5️⃣ Reward yourself when completing important tasks
Did you finish something relevant? Take time for a coffee, a break or something that motivates you. Creating a cycle of effort and reward helps you maintain momentum without burnout.

1iyq4fy,https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginalCharacter/comments/1iyq4fy/sunflower_and_wormwood/,🌻Sunflower and Wormwood 🌿,"I tapped my fingers on the steering wheel to the rhythm of the song pouring from the radio. A mixture of anticipation and nervousness churned inside me, a dangerous cocktail electrifying every cell in my body with energy that was struggling to get out. Just one more turn, one more street, and you'll be there, the navigation display told me.

It wasn't exactly perfect housing, but I didn't have the luxury of choice. I could thank the gods that I'd found something before the heavy atmosphere between Herman and me tipped over into a storm.

The tapping accelerated, my nails digging into the synthetic surface. A pale yellow apartment building emerged between the other buildings, my new home. I found a free space quickly, killed the engine, and got out. The neighborhood was quiet; it was a little after noon, and the cold weather didn't exactly encourage hanging around outside. I just admired the view of the building for a moment. It wasn't the newest building, but it wasn't in that brutalist style that always gave me depression. In the window of the top floor, where I believed my apartment was, I noticed a shadow. I shook my head and stopped gawking.

The click of the car door, the trunk, the jangling of keys in the lock, and I'm at the entrance, communicating with the metallic voice that lets me in. The elevator, of course, isn't working, so I take the stairs. The hallways are neutral, painted cream, with gray linoleum imitating wood on the floor. The sterility is only broken by the doors to the apartments themselves, as if the individuality of their owners was leaking through the cracks, whether in the form of a funny doormat, a modified name tag, or simply the furnishing of the hallway itself. Soon I'm cursing the stairs and myself, since the apartment was on the top floor and I was dragging one of the many boxes waiting to be unloaded. I took a short break before the last floor, because leaving a first impression as a disheveled, breathless Marfuša wouldn't be the best.

The cocktail of impressions inside me was churning. I moved my legs, conquered the last flight of stairs, and stood on the top floor, which was illuminated by a strip of light from the open door. An elderly woman in a cardigan stood there, like the final boss of a dungeon.
""Welcome, Žaneta,"" she smiled slightly. I immediately recognized the voice I had arranged everything with over the phone. I returned her greeting and stepped into the hallway.
I was greeted by creaking parquet floors and slightly worn, but pretty, green wallpaper. I put the box down on the shoe rack, where I noticed a pair of tall black boots with metal toes. Is my roommate some kind of metalhead?
""Your room is here,"" she opened the door on my right and let me peek into a small but clean room that was unmistakable from the photos in the ad.
""It's nice,"" I remarked before we moved on to the next door. I was quickly introduced to the bathroom, which was just an older but functional bathroom, and then she led me to the living room and kitchenette in one, so there would be something to sign the contract on. I stepped into what was probably the nicest space so far. It was a really sunny room and I was hit by a kind of spicy scent of something I couldn't identify but it was pleasant. The ceiling was sloped because of the roof, and the skylights drew squares of golden light on the floor. And then I noticed it.

In the middle of one of the islands of light, a round, shaggy rug with a pentagram was unmistakably basking. And it wasn't just a five-pointed star, because there were some dubious squiggles around its edges. Before I could get too caught up in it, the contract was already on the table and a pen was in my hands. I was quickly told some information and rules about the maintenance of the common areas, nothing worth mentioning in depth, as I was still hypnotizing that unusual accessory with my eyes. The formal matters followed into the hallway, where she was already taking her jacket and hat from the hook.
""The other tenant is about the same age as you, he's a quiet man, no one has complained yet,"" she assured me, while putting on her shoes, ""he's usually in his room, from what previous tenants told me—""

We were interrupted by the creaking of wood and stiff hinges.

I turned around. The last door was wide open, and in its frame stood a shadow peering out from the darkness of the room behind it. A pair of eyes blinked at me. As the figure slowly emerged from the shadows, I made out the tip of a sloped nose, teeth, and then the whole person.

""Mr. Rrazeb, Ms. Žaneta,"" she introduced us simply.

""Nice to meet you,"" I breathed out automatically. I tried not to stare, but it was difficult.
He was tall. Not insanely so, but about a head taller than my meager 165 centimeters. Pale, dressed in a black amorphous hoodie with a pentagram and tight jeans. His arms were crossed over his torso, impenetrable as a fortress.
""You too,"" a disinterested voice mumbled, the tone of which didn't quite sit right with me. It was quiet, particularly deep and whispery. The rug and the boots suddenly made sense.
""Well, I'll leave you two,"" she sang, ""if anything happens, call me. I hope you'll enjoy living here,"" she continued with a smile, a set of keys landed in my hands, and the door closed behind her. I turned back to Rrazeb, but he was also gone. I sighed, I guess it's naive to expect that he'd want to chat with a complete stranger, especially if the rug isn't a unique artifact of his...hobbies? Can you call Satanism a hobby? Wait, is he a Satanist? Aren't you judging a bit too quickly, Žaneta?

I picked up the box and went to take a better look at my room. It was endowed with the same wallpaper as the hallway, a simple bed with its headboard facing the window, a wardrobe, and a few shelves. It wasn't very big, so I knew that even though I hadn't been able to take much from my home, I would soon fill it with every cute, floral trinket that came my way. Labels with notes on where to put things, swatches of color palettes and patterns were already flashing before my eyes. The rug, which was waiting for me packed in the trunk, would go perfectly at the foot of the bed. I'll find some floral curtains somewhere, maybe a small garland for the beams. And what about flowers! I left them all at home, they'll die soon anyway with Herman being such an anti-talent at taking care of anything. He even killed a cactus! He killed Hugo the Thorny,  whom I had for years. But he just had to secretly water it, even though I told him several times not to, please. Poor Hugo rotted.

I snapped out of my creative trance and started taking things out of the box on the bed. It seemed better to unpack and tidy up at least something, rather than later standing in a sea of all sorts of knick-knacks and desperately searching for, say, bed linen. Floral, of course. I was also kind of putting off another trip up the stairs.

""Do you want help with moving?""

I jumped and quickly turned around. The owner of the voice was leaning against the doorframe, watching me with an unreadable expression. I felt a chill. How long had he been there?

""The elevator's dead, so I hope you don't have too many things that need to be carried up,"" he added when I didn't answer.
""That would be nice of you,"" I nodded, and left the unpacking, ""there's a lot."" At that, he shrugged and went to the door, where he slipped into those tall boots. His greasy black hair, which reached a little below his shoulders, was quickly tied with a rubber band from his jeans pocket into a careless ponytail. He turned to me and raised his eyebrows questioningly, as if to ask if I was coming. We went outside.

He followed me up the stairs as silently as a shadow, until his silence started to make me feel a little uneasy. When we were in front of the apartment building, he squinted at the light for a moment. In the outdoor lighting, it was even more apparent how pale he was. Like a corpse, it flashed through my mind as I peeked at the circles under his deeply set eyes. Like a junkie, a part of my brain that was otherwise asleep spoke up...

I unlocked the trunk and started pulling out the packed things. He wordlessly held out his arms and let me load him up. As he took them, I noticed his hands. Thin fingers with chipped black nail polish and a few rings. A silver snake, some kind of seal—
""That's enough, I can't carry any more,"" he pulled me out of my thoughts. I grabbed what I could and the trek back up began. I wasn't a particularly sporty type, I was never drawn to it, especially with work I gave up on anything more demanding than occasional walks. After the first two floors, I was already panting and felt absolutely embarrassed in front of Rrazeb. I heard the echo of Herman's voice about a panting locomotive and shaking thighs. Useless, unable to even climb the damn stairs.

A metallic taste spread in my mouth. Damn. I bit my lip. I turned to Rrazeb, to see if he might have noticed, but he was dawdling up the stairs behind me. Huh. He wasn't doing too well either.

""How...how long have you actually lived here?"" I tried to bring up a topic for conversation and change my thoughts; the silence was eating me like acid. He thought for a moment.
""About three, four years,"" he mumbled as he passed me, ""how long do you want to live here?""

I stopped mid-step. How long do I want to live here? I repeated to myself, trying to find an answer quickly. But it didn't come. I had no plan; this was an escape from a world I didn't want to belong to.
""Until you find better housing?"" he added for me. For the first time, I recognized something other than pure apathy in his voice. I twitched and started to notice my surroundings again. He was a few steps above me, his eyes looking back at me over a pile of ceramics wrapped in newspaper. I nodded eagerly and started walking again.

We didn't talk much more, but at least I used it as an opportunity to get a better look at him. He was gifted with a noticeable overbite, and whenever he opened his mouth even slightly, his front teeth pushed out like rodents. His nose was unremarkable, it didn't stand out much from his face and was a bit upturned, which made me think of a rabbit even more. His chin receded, blending a bit with his neck, even though he was otherwise thin in the face. Poor guy, he didn't exactly win the genetic lottery.

But those eyes.

His gaze was captivating, and given the hints of his hobby, I was afraid to look at them too closely, lest I get lost in them. Dark, like their owner.

After several repeated descents and ascents of the staircase, I stood in the room again with my hands on my hips. The unpacking had dragged on, the sky behind the window panes was starting to turn a grayish blue and fade. I was somewhat satisfied with the end result, but I cursed myself for not doing something more useful instead of arranging aesthetic knick-knacks on the shelves. And also, hunger was already making itself known.

I took the dishes, which ironically had been brought up first, and went to put them in the kitchenette. A mug, a tin cup, a chipped bowl, a burnt pan, and a quite worn cutting board – the spartan equipment of the second tenant. At least my maximalism came in handy for something, I thought, as I searched for the best place for the baking dish. Baking was probably the only thing I loved more than cottagecore aesthetics. The countertop and cabinets themselves weren't bad, a little worn, but that could be hidden.

I had yogurt for dinner, put away some groceries I bought on the way to the apartment building, and started preparing for tomorrow's Monday. My commute to work hadn't changed significantly with the move, but given my sense of direction, I was apprehensive about the new route. And also waking up, oh god, waking up, I'm sure I'll wake up and panic that I'm in a strange house. I can already see it - Žaneta, kidnapped by the mafia, or something like that.

I stopped in front of his room, my index finger hovering uncertainly over the door, but I changed my mind when I heard the muffled sounds of guitars and drums from behind it. Some kind of metal, anyway. I won't tempt fate; I've already had enough interactions, or rather lack thereof, from him today. And I'd probably say something crazy anyway. My brain sometimes deserved an award for worst playwright of the year. Or best comedian, depending on your point of view.

I was tired as a kitten, I rushed through my evening routine and went to bed as soon as possible. The mattress swallowed me. I had never encountered such a soft bed before and I wasn't sure if I liked it. After half an hour of tossing and turning, I was starting to sympathize with Rapunzel when she was trying to find just the right bed at the bears'. I turned to the other side and put my hand under my head. I heard a faint creaking; it was probably Rrazeb doing something in his room. Or someone is in the hallway. Or below us... Apartment building. The shadows in the room outlined jagged mountains and the arms of corpses. And then there were those strange sounds that always pulled me out of my half-sleep. But finally, I fell into the arms of sleep.

And was shortly thereafter yanked out by Jack Stauber.

I jumped out of bed, got tangled in the duvet, almost tripped over one of the boxes, and landed on the chair. Mobile, mobile, where did I leave it?

""Hoarder of quarters
And no boundary boredom-dom
Boundary boredom!"" the tin machine rang out happily. I untangled myself from the prison of the duvet, opened the curtains, hoping to find it faster in the light. Floor? Empty. Desk? Overflowing, but no mobile.

""Baby Hotline, please dial nine to get out!
No flatline, what were you scared about?""

I fished it out from under the bed and finally turned off the alarm.
""Clumsy,"" I sighed and started to get myself together. I hope I didn't wake him up. Or anyone in the neighboring apartments; I don't know yet how thin the walls are here.

Most of the day went by in the usual routine. Making phone calls, typing on the keyboard, trying to avoid the local office gossips. I was practically staggering up the stairs to the apartment. I unlocked the door, threw my bag on the bed, and gratefully changed into my home clothes. A sweater with sunflowers and green sweatpants. I instantly felt better; something about floral patterns just released endorphins in me.

New mission - bathroom.

After what I saw in the fridge, I didn't have a high opinion of its condition. So I tied my hair in a messy bun, put on gloves, and started scrubbing.

In itself, it wasn't bad. Like the rest of the apartment, the ravages of time had taken their toll, and the tiles were so retro in color that it was almost too much even for me, but I could imagine a few overly long baths in it. This positivity left me when I noticed a patch of mold in the corner by the bathtub. I added bleach to my imaginary shopping list and attacked it with a brush.

On the shelf sat sadly a 10-in-1 shampoo, shower gel, soap, atomic bomb, motor oil, and I don't know what (men, honestly) in the company of hair gel, incredibly flat toothpaste, and a toothbrush. I bumped something on the windowsill with my elbow, which clinked against the enamel of the tub. An ashtray. Oh hell, I hope he doesn't smoke here, I thought, remembering Herman and his disgusting habit. But the room didn't smell of cigarettes; in fact, I realized that the spicy, herbal cloud from the living room was more pronounced in it. Is it perhaps a question of WHAT he smokes?

I pressed harder on the brush, as if trying to scrape that thought from the face of the earth. Pentagram. Antisocial. Dubious herbs. What else will I find?

The question answered itself soon enough. Forgotten on the floor behind the sink, among the dust bunnies, I found an eyeliner pencil. Probably an artifact from the last tenant?

The following days were anything but exciting. The deadline at work was looming, Herman was bombarding me with text messages, sleep decided to go on vacation to the Canary Islands, Rrazeb was still just a shadow that I occasionally glimpsed in my peripheral vision. I swear, that guy is probably playing vampire and reveling in it. His room, which I hadn't had a chance to look into since the first day, is a dark crypt like something out of Dracula. His wardrobe consists only of charcoal black and he survives on astral energy. In the few days I've been here, I've only seen him eat once, and that was some dubious instant ramen noodles. The wrappers I found in the trash weren't from exactly healthy things, but with my stomach, I have no right to judge. He didn't have much in the fridge and pantry; maybe his supplies were in his room. Oh, and coffee. He definitely drank coffee, judging by the mug and the strange hammered pot that always appeared in the sink in the morning. As I started to use the spaces more and clean up, I noticed details that I had overlooked on the day of the move, or had decided to ignore. The rug wasn't the only occult reminder.

Those few forgotten books on the dresser? Grimoires, whatever that word means. Curiosity got the better of me and I looked into one, I think it was called Ars Goetica. It opened to a page with an owl demon with a crown on its head, which at least made the corners of my mouth twitch. Next to them was a statue of some abomination that I didn't even want to touch. He had a similar one on one of the t-shirts I'd seen him in. A few unused candlesticks, tarot cards, a forgotten necklace with an inverted cross that I moved wearing gloves.All of it painted a picture even more bizarre than his name. At night, I sometimes heard the click of a door followed by the creaking of parquet floors, accompanied by a faint clinking and sounds muffled by fabric. Mostly I stopped noticing it and fell asleep at a reasonable time. But on Friday night, I decided to stay up later and listen.

A long creak, that's Mr. Satanist crawling out of his crypt like Nosferatu. Light steps of a doe across the hallway, the faint slap of shoe soles. The click of the front door and the rattle of a key in the lock. Receding stomping on the stairs. At least he locks up after himself, I tried to find something positive in it, while my thoughts were occupied with the question of what such a guy could be doing in the city at two in the morning. A walk through the dead streets? A meeting with dubious entities? A date with Moloch (I picked that up from his curse when he kicked his toe on the table) in the cemetery? Whatever it was, it sent shivers down my spine. Herman's ""And what will you do without me?"" was a daily occurrence.

And then came the weekend. I couldn't believe it had only been less than a week since I moved in. My nerves testified to something else. I planned to heal my soul over those two days, to recharge my batteries. Due to staying up late, I overslept and irresponsibly spent the first hour after waking up in bed, reveling in things I wanted but couldn't afford. Gradually, I let myself be lulled into that lazy half-sleep, where dreams mingle with thoughts and reality, which somehow pleasantly saps your energy and dulls your brain. A thousand different patterned pillows, stuffed animals, and books I already have, but with beautiful covers. I fantasized about a library with perfectly arranged rows of my favorite novels, their spines forming scenes from the stories. The fact that it wouldn't fit in my room and that I had left most of my collection with Herman or my parents, I forgot at that moment. I walked through my dream house in a flowing dress with forget-me-nots, a flower pot and another cute ornament greeted me at every step. Warm golden rays fell from the windows, the chirping of birds and the scent of flowers wafted through. I found myself in a hammock, staring at the azure sky, at the flowing puffs of clouds. The breeze played with my curls, the sun tickled my cheeks. I blissfully squinted at it and sank deeper into dreaming. Suddenly, a shadow fell upon me. I opened them. Above me stood a smiling, friendly outline...of someone.

I was completely pulled out of my dreaming by a growling stomach and thirst. At first, I was sorry, but after a few moments, only a remnant of a warm feeling and a hazy memory of happiness remained of the fantasy.
I threw on my fluffy pink bathrobe, another dose of endorphins, slipped into my slippers, and still half-asleep, I went into the kitchen. I stepped into a cloud of coffee and cinnamon. A heavy scent that settled on my already half-closed eyelids, and I immediately asked myself if I was still asleep.
""Good morning,"" a quiet voice said, and I almost had a stroke. Rrazeb. He was leaning lazily against the counter, of course in a black hoodie, and watching me.
""Good!"" I squeaked fearfully and immediately wanted to slap myself properly. Given how we had been avoiding each other all week, I didn't expect him to be awake. Or to be in the apartment at all. I quickly pulled my bathrobe closer to my neck and prayed that I didn't have a bird's nest on my head. But he obviously didn't care, his attention was elsewhere. I focused on what he was actually doing. That strange pot was bubbling on the stove.
""Cezve,"" he commented on my confused look, but that word somehow wasn't in my vocabulary.
""Do you want some coffee too?"" he added to the awkward silence, his voice somehow jumping at the end of the sentence.
""Yes, thank you,"" I finally came back down to earth, smiled, and sat down at the table.
""I didn't wake you, did I?"" he glanced at me as he took the džezva off the flame and put it back, ""the door hinges need oil like salt."" I definitely didn't have the longest conversation with Rrazeb on today's list of plans.
""A little bit, yes. But I couldn't sleep anyway. Do you go out this late often?""
""Yes.""

I didn't feel like prying out of him for what purpose, not today, not so early in the morning and before coffee. He was just pouring it from the pot into a cup. A thin hand reached out to me and, Ah! Was my eyesight deceiving me, or did he smile faintly?
""Thank you,"" I sacrificed it and took the cup in my hands. Not only was it pleasantly warm, but it was also the source of that divine scent. For a moment I closed my eyes and just let it permeate me. It reminded me of visiting a spice shop, a bakery, and a library all in one. A memory from the dream also surfaced.
""Cinnamon is nice,"" I heard him say quietly, seeing my expression. He filled the pot with water, ground beans, and tortured it over the flame again. On the table lay a carton of milk and a sugar bowl, which I reached for.
""There's already sugar in it,"" he said, so I let the spoon thud back and just added milk. I carefully sipped. It was stronger than I usually have. Much stronger. I also soon found out that it wasn't filtered, and that I had to drink carefully. While I was doing so, I watched him over the rim of the cup. As always, he looked like a corpse, which was in contrast to the warmest mood so far. So far I had only seen him in long sleeves, which made sense given the time of year, but those were rolled up, revealing bony limbs. He probably doesn't eat much, I thought. They looked almost transparent, blue veins showing through, and I recognized a few old scars. They reminded me of the ones my childhood friend used to have, a real rascal climbing every tree he encountered along the way. The one who threw himself laughing into the stream, jumped on clods in the field, and fear trembled before him.

A sigh escaped my lips. The chair opposite me groaned, Rrazeb sat down with his cup. Silence fell in the kitchen, broken only by the clinking of cups and the faint sounds of furniture. I rubbed my thumb on the surface of the ceramic and thought with a furrowed brow what to say. Finally point out the elephant in the room? I took a breath. It was probably the best time to break the ice.

""That carpet...interesting choice,"" I remarked, watching his reaction. He nodded.
""I like the,"" he cleared his throat, ""aesthetic."" Sure, aesthetic, the otherwise silent part of my brain said. I gave him a meaningful look, encouraging him to continue, but given my round face, I was about as intimidating as a sleepy kitten.
""So you don't sacrifice virgins to the goat god?"" I blurted out suddenly. For a moment there was dead silence. Then he almost sputtered his coffee and started choking. I immediately regretted my approach.
""No!"" he squeaked in turn, in a tone completely different from the one he had been speaking in.
""No virgins! I mean, n-no sacrificing of virgins,"" he was coughing again and trying to hide his face in his hands. I let him calm down and tried not to laugh at the surprising reaction.
""So...?""
""I'm just an occultist. Hermeticism, Satanism, other occult sciences. No harming others,"" he looked me in the eye, trying to emphasize the striking truth of that sentence. And I believed him.
""That's a really interesting hobby. Is it even safe?"" I couldn't resist asking. He chuckled faintly at that.
""As safe as you believe it to be,"" he exhaled, got up, and went to the fridge. I tried to decipher that cryptic sentence, but it somehow didn't go over my head.

A cheese with holes and a piece of bread landed on the table. I was finishing my cup, the bitter grounds of the coffee dregs were no longer ignorable. They formed interesting patterns at the bottom. Don't they predict the future? Mine reminded me of a stretching cat. Or a cloud over the moon.
""Who was your previous roommate?""
""Huh?"" he looked up from the bread he had just bitten into. I really have terrible timing.
""Some young IT guy, I think,"" he mumbled and swallowed. Jesus, he really does look like a rat with those teeth. I ran my hand through my hair, asking about the eyeliner would probably be a bit too much.
""We didn't talk much. I'm an introvert."" He had short, sharp sentences, even though he obviously had something to say. I started working on my food, a look at the clock reminding me that I wanted to get something done today too. Definitely buy groceries, maybe even look for something small for the apartment. I was also tempted to visit the park and the library, which I hoped would become my new oases of peace.

I heard the clinking of a plate and the flow of water, he was standing at the sink, quickly washing up after himself.
""If you're going out, you don't have to lock up. I'll be home,"" he mumbled quietly again and put the dishes on the drying rack. I just nodded at that and watched him return to his tomb. I just sat there for a while in silence and wondered if I had dreamed it all.

The world feels a little crazy right now, but on a micro scale life is going on, we're all going to work, and taking care of or families. Obviously, we're all primarily focused on that (myself included).

I have to believe though that there are others that want to engage with people locally, both that share their views and don't.

I have my feelings on national politics, but at the end of the day SO many decisions that actually affect our lives and families and livelihoods happen right here at home. 

And Erie is a wildly diverse city! Despite that fact, I feel like personally at least I don't get a ton of opportunities to engage with people from other walks of life face-to-face, in low-pressure situations.

At least in my opinion, town halls or city council meetings or things of that ilk will almost always be high pressure, because there are things at stake people care about! However, I don't necessarily think those are ever going to be places where people can just meet each other, and engage in conversation. 

What I would love to see is a local space that is considered neutral or deeply appreciated by many in Erie host an event. In my mind this is an open call in a shared space to come talk, have a coffee with, and engage with other people in Erie just because, with the intention of just getting to know our neighbors and build community.

Do you think this is possible? Or people would participate? I'm no one, but I'd love feedback because I'm willing to try to put this together.",0,1740583726.0,Erie,4,0.33,False

Procrastination can delay promotions, hamper deliveries and even impede professional growth. If you feel like you could be getting more done at work, here are 5 strategies to increase your productivity and avoid procrastination:

1️⃣ Start with what generates the most impact
If you're having trouble getting started, choose the task that will bring the most results to your career. It's often what we avoid, but it's what matters most.

2️⃣ Use the 2 minute rule
If something takes less than 2 minutes to do, do it now! Replying to a quick email or organizing a small task avoids backlogs that drain your productivity.

3️⃣ Break big tasks into small steps
Long projects can be demotivating. Break it down into smaller steps and short deadlines. This facilitates progress and reduces feelings of overwhelm.

4️⃣ Eliminate distractions at work
Turn off unnecessary notifications, block websites that steal your attention, and set specific time periods for emails and meetings. An organized environment helps you stay focused.

5️⃣ Reward yourself when completing important tasks
Did you finish something relevant? Take time for a coffee, a break or something that motivates you. Creating a cycle of effort and reward helps you maintain momentum without burnout.

I want to own a coffee shop/ bookstore one day but I don’t have any experience with either other than them being my personal interests/ hobbies I do at home. I would work for a coffee shop or bookstore now, but I have bills to pay so that won’t financially make sense. I tried interior design but I think I’d like interior decorating more. I was in sales and enjoyed it, but I can’t see myself doing it forever. I did some content creation but got pretty bored of it as it wasn’t very mentally stimulating and I felt I was regurgitating the same type of content daily. 

I have my Bachelor’s in communications, but I don’t even know if I am going to use it or if I want to. Maybe if there was a coffee shop or bookstore store that needed social media help I’d use it, but other than that, I’m not sure what communications careers would interest me.

I feel like I’m getting to the age that I need to choose a career that makes actual money, especially if I plan on starting a business. I just don’t want to be miserable at work or uninterested in it. What kind of jobs should I look into?

my partner and i are sort of in a nightmare situation with the dog recently adopted in the last month. for background, she is a year and a half old (likely) border collie mix that came from a reservation about 5 months ago. both of us have plenty of experience with high energy dogs of all ages and were prepared for multiple walks a day and playtime with her and things like that. my partner works from home and would be able to spend a bit of time with her as well.

long story short, we think the rescue we adopted her from and the foster lied to us about her situation. we were told she is a chill dog that's both potty and crate trained, as well as some basic obedience. the foster said there were days she didn't get a walk and she would be totally fine, content to lay around the house. we were also told that she was good out of her crate and didn't need supervision. we figured by that description and meeting her once that she would be a great fit. the last thing the foster told us was that she had been returned once already for being aggressive, something that was not part of her adoption profile but told to us by the foster herself. the foster said she believed they had returned her for invalid reasons and that she never had issues like that.

since we got her, she has been increasingly aggressive toward us, despite our best efforts to make our home as inviting and comfortable as possible. she has been biting us, usually unprompted, first when we pet her or were playing, but now it's randomly as she walks by when we're standing or something. we've both gotten many bruises on our arms from where she chomped, as well as our hands, legs, and feet. if it seems like she's overly anxious, we don't push it and pet her. we do our best to respect her boundaries and not touch her or interact with her when she's acting like that. this dog is also not crate trained. it can take us upwards of 30 mins to get her in there at any given time and she cries endlessly when in there. we don't force her, she has blankets and crate-only toys, but i can only assume she had a bad experience at one point. the only time she willingly goes is for meals, as we feed all them in there. she's peed in the house a couple times with no warning, but otherwise she goes to the door, so they didn't lie about that one. she also has almost no basic obedience training; she will sit when she wants, but otherwise does not listen to ""no,"" ""off,"" or ""down,"" all commands her foster told us she knew. she counter-surfs (another problem the foster ""never had""), and chews on every piece of furniture to the point we moved our coffee table to a room she can't get in. she needs 100% supervision when out of her kennel and even then it's impossible to contain her. we also have a baby gate keeping her from going upstairs since that's where we keep our plants (inside for winter) and have a small library nook that she's already tried to destroy. she's made it her mission to get over the baby gate at all costs. she's jumped about 6 feet from the back of the couch over the gate to get upstairs.

we made the decision to return her to the rescue (per the contract we signed), but they told us it can take up to 30 days to find a new foster, with no more concrete timeline than that. all of the information, with emphasis on the aggression, has been provided to them. originally, they told us her old foster would take her back after a few days, but the next day the rescue said she'd backed out of taking her again. we have her another 20 days (hopefully at most, but i'm losing hope they'll find a foster and make us keep her another month even though we've signed over ownership already), and just need something to do with her. we have tried all the calming treats and chews, calming music, long walks, training sessions, puzzle toys, lick mats, you name it. nothing will chill her out. we don't know if it's anxiety or what, but we can't sit on the couch without fear of being bitten or jumped on, and it's stressing us out. i know our stress is not helping her, but we're out of ideas. our determination is that she was probably basically feral when she was taken off the reservation, and is hardly domesticated, so being in a house is simply not an option anymore. we don't have a fence because the foster said with her activity level, walks would suffice. she deserves a good home and life because she can be really sweet, so while we still have her we want her to live decently. we're receiving no help from the rescue, we can't take her to the vet because we don't own her anymore, so meds are out of the question.

I've seen people put it into the microwave for a few seconds and some people literally put it in for a full minute (60 seconds) which seems like you are asking for trouble since that cup will probably leak a ton of chemicals at high temperatures in a microwave.

I asked someone doing it recently if it's safe and they said that since they don't microwave it with the plastic lid or the cardboard drink holder, that it should be fine. This doesn't seem right.

The literal cup says do not microwave. I assume it is flammable or the coating on the cup to keep it sturdy against a hot coffee has some chemicals that shouldn't be microwaved.

Does anyone know the specifics of why it is dangerous to microwave the cups? I had one person explain that they say do not microwave because people will microwave it for too long and just a few seconds is okay.

Also her 2 dogs are causing a strain on our relationship (they’re destructive towards our house and keep running away). Is my unhappiness and my leaving her justified ?

I met my girlfriend ( F 29) in fall of 2023, im M 27. We had a good start to our relationship because we connected on an emotional level and we both felt like we could be open with each other and not judge each other, i also valued her alot because it seemed like she had an honest heart and really valued loyalty which i do too. When i first met her she seemed really down on her luck (fired from a good restaurant serving job) which ultimately hurt her financially and she had to find another serving job and also work another part time job at a coffee shop to make ends meet. She also lived by herself in a ghetto area studio apartment with her two dogs (outdoor breeds : husky and aussie). I on the other hand dont claim to be doing super fantastic in life but i have a stable full time factory job with full benefits and good job security. I was living at home with my parents at the time because i honestly have a good relationship with them and dont see the need to live by myself if i dont have to. It’s also important to note that she didnt even have a operational car at the time (both her jobs were walking distance) when meeting her but i didnt mind any of this because we had a good connection. Anyways.. (i met her as my server) asked her out and all is really good in the beginning. I never judged her for struggling at the time because like i said we had a good emotional connection. It’s also important to note that she has bad connections with her mom and her dad had passed away, so she’s not to close to family. Anyways im getting kind of tired of living at home and also she’s getting a notice that she’s getting evicted from her apartment because she was behind on payments (first redflag i stupidly ignored). Coincidentally a good friend of mine has the house next door to him on the market soon (his boss’ rental) and he extends the offer to me. As kind of a solution to both our problems i suggest moving in at January of 2024. We both only after a couple months of knowing each other move in. It was a nice and newly renovated house in a nice and quiet tiny town outside of the major city we live in (15 mins away) 3 bedroom 2 bathroom with a backyard and everything affordable and cheaper than her studio was if we split it which we did. Anyways after a few months i start noticing how much her adhd has a strain on her and she struggles with organizational tasks and keeping things clean. It’s needlessly messy alot of the times. And if we do clean everything, then it’s literally a mess again a week later if not 2 at the max. That alongside her dogs (which i dont think she should even have ,and dont even know how she managed to have those 2 specific breeds in a tiny studio apartment) being very destructive to our backyard and constantly escape. I was under the impression that the backyard would solve all the issues and we even went to the extent to buy 2 nice dog houses that they dont even use. So now instead they stay in a spare room that theyve damaged some of the carpet, blinds, and not to mention there’s hair everywhere. My girlfriend and her dogs totally disrespect that room ( she smokes her weed inside that room and it’s disgusting looking and smelling). Whenever i tell her the way she treats the room bothers me, she brushes me off and tells me not to tell her what to do and that she’ll get to it (which she never has and will). Her life has improved since she met me though, she has a newer functional car and she got a new full time job as a teachers assistant and also part time job as the bartender down the street but she still manages to have money it seems like. I on the other hand and almost done with my online school and will have my bachelors degree in a few months. Ive tried to tell her to do online school with me but she seems uninterested. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t even respect her anymore because the dog situation, her adhd, and her willingness to level up in life and she just wants to fight me on everything. I’ve officially decided to move out in a few weeks and i feel terrible because ive given up on her. Any feedback would be appreciated as to what they think about the situation. I just wish she would get on some adhd medication and she could function normally as an adult. ",1,1740582980.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

by c.w. cobblestone

The alarm jarred me awake at 6:30 a.m. I didn’t feel like getting out of bed and facing another day as a lowly maid, but I dragged my sissy ass upright and stumbled to the guest bathroom shower. Trying to wash away the blues only made my skin red.

The previous day, I’d done my best to be happy and embrace my new role as the family’s transgendered servant, but that feeling had waned, and I couldn’t shake my sadness. My earlier enthusiasm had been beaten right out of me, thanks to the rude way I’d been treated the day before, and the unfair rules that had been imposed on me. I felt like a total loser as I donned one of my maid’s uniforms and applied makeup. Although I did my face carefully, trying to recall Brooke’s techniques, my handiwork was a little wobbly. I took inventory in the mirror and reminded myself that I needed to go shopping for panties, a wig and high heels, per my masters’ orders.

With a sigh, I sat on the bed, taking one last break before starting what I knew was going to be a long, exhausting day. Cody had decreed that I wasn’t allowed to rest while on the clock, so I knew this would be my last chance to sit down for a while, other than driving the girls to school. I cringed when I considered how much worst it would be wearing five-inch heels.

“What the hell kind of life is this?” I muttered.

I thought of the alternative. Divorce. The idea of living without Liz was enough to make me rise from the bed and face the day.

My morose mood got worse when I brought Liz and Cody their morning coffee. Just seeing them snuggling together so obviously happy made me want to cry. But I donned my fake sissy smile and greeted them with a cheery, “Good morning, Mistress, good morning, Master.”

Liz looked up and frowned. “Your makeup is sloppy,” she said. “Didn’t Brooke teach you how to do it?”

“Um, yes, Mistress, I’m sorry; I tried to do it the way she did.”

“Well, that foundation is caked up around your jawline, and it looks like you got more mascara on your eyelids than your eyelashes. What did you use, a damned paintbrush?”

“I … I’m sorry, Mistress, I’ll redo it when I get a chance.”

“No, you’ll redo it now — and give yourself a check mark,” Cody snapped. “I don’t like sloppy maids.”

“Y-yes, Master.” I curtseyed and scurried away to carry out the order. After I put the dreaded check mark in the little notebook that I’d dug out of the basement the night before, which brought the count to three, I finished reapplying my makeup and again reported to my masters in their bedroom.

“That’s a little better,” Liz said. “But that eyeliner is still kind of sloppy. Do better, Mirabella, you hear? Practice.”

“Yes, Mistress.” Curtsey.

“Good. Now, get the girls up and start on breakfast. I’ll just have eggs and sausage. Oh, and make hash browns.”

“Yes, Mistress.” Curtsey.

“I want pancakes,” Cody ordered.

With a final curtsey and a polite “Yes, Master,” I exited my former quarters and ventured down the hallway to the girls’ rooms.

“Miss Brooke?” I called after tapping lightly on her door. “Are you up?”

“Yeah.”

“What would you like for breakfast, Miss?”

I heard a yawn, followed by the word, “Cereal.”

“Any particular kind, Miss?”

“Cheerios”

“Yes, Miss.”

I curtseyed, even though the door was closed, and shuddered at how my subservience was becoming automatic.

More shivers trickled through me as I approached Mia’s door and knocked as gently and respectfully as possible.

“M-Miss Mia? Are you up?”

No answer.

“Um, Miss Mia? Your mother said she wants you to get up, please … Miss Mia?”

I carefully opened the door, but after having been reprimanded the previous morning for turning on the light, I whispered in the darkness: “Miss Mia? Your mom says to get up, Miss. Please, Miss.”

“Alright, alright, get out of here.”

“Yes, Miss, thank you, Miss. Um, what would you like for breakfast, Miss?”

I already had two separate breakfasts to prepare plus Brooke’s cereal, so I hoped Mia would want something simple. But when she replied, “Eggs Benedict,” I knew I’d have to scramble to get everything ready. Still, after curtseying and rushing to the kitchen, I counted my blessings that the routine of waking up the little brat had gone fairly smoothly. Any interaction with Mia that didn’t include her yelling or insulting me was a relief.

While Liz and the girls showered upstairs, I hopped around the kitchen getting breakfast ready. I had eggs cooking on one burner, and pans on the other three flames with sausage, ham and pancakes. I put the hashbrowns in the air fryer, the English muffins for Mia’s eggs Benedict in the toaster, and poured Cheerios into a bowl, with plans to add milk when Brooke was ready to eat.

Cody ambled downstairs in his pajamas and sat at the table. As I poured him a cup of coffee, he turned around to ensure nobody was within earshot before whispering in my ear: “Once we introduce Liz to things, I’m gonna be pissing in your mouth every morning, you hear? Now, what do you say?”

“Um, thank you, Master.”

He reached up my skirt and fondled my cock cage. “All secure, there, sissy?”

“Y-yes, Master.”

“Good.” He slapped me on the ass. “Now, hurry up with my pancakes, I’m hungry.”

“Yes Master, they’re cooking now.” I dipped a smart curtsey and hurried back into the kitchen, feeling used and abused not a half-hour into the new day.

As I cooked, I contemplated the prospect of having to drink Cody’s urine to start each morning, and it prompted a mixture of depression and sexual excitement. Cody was a self-described sadist who enjoyed hurting and humiliating me — exactly how I’d wanted Liz to act during our marriage, although she had dominated me everywhere but the bedroom. Since Cody had entered the picture, though, I was getting all the sexual debasement I could handle, and then some. He was like a kid in a candy store, being free after 12 years in a POW camp, reuniting with his family and having a full-time sissy maid at his disposal. Cody was taking his second chance at life and running with it, and clearly having a ball in the process. I resented and admired him for it — and felt like a piece of meat because of how he pawed and slapped me on the ass whenever the fancy struck him — and that turned me on more.

I pushed those thoughts from my head and concentrated on making breakfast. I was able to have everything ready by the time Liz and her daughters came downstairs, dressed for the day.

The morning meal was fairly uneventful, although Mia continued snapping her fingers at me whenever she wanted something, and would often look at her dad, who’d chuckle his approval. By this time Liz obviously didn’t care if Mia was rude to me, and, as long as her little sister wasn’t too over-the-top, neither did Brooke.

As breakfast was wrapping up, a question occurred to me, so I waited for a break in the conversation before curtseying. “Um, excuse me? I have to drive the girls to school, and I’m still dressed like this.”

Cody shrugged. “You don’t get out of the minivan when you drop them off, do you?”

“No, Master.”

“So just wear a long coat. And sunglasses to hide your makeup.”

“Um, yes, Master.”

“I don’t know,” Liz mused. “If he gets caught, and Mrs. Carrington found out …”

Cody waved his hand. “Fine, you’ll just have to wash your face and change every morning and then do your makeup when you get back.”

“You need the practice, anyway,” Liz sniffed.

“Yeah, you do.” Brooke frowned. “I showed you how to do mascara, didn’t I?”

“Yes, Miss.”

“I can show you again,” she said with a smile.

“Thank you.” I curtseyed. “Is it okay if I go wash my face and change now?”

I was surprised when Brooke granted permission, since I’d asked Cody. He seemed to get a kick out of his oldest daughter taking charge like that as I curtseyed and thanked her before rushing off to change.

The ride to school went smoothly, with both girls immersed in their cellphones the entire trip. When I got back home, Cody was upstairs asleep, so after dressing in my uniform and reapplying my makeup, I did the quiet chores like scrubbing floors and polishing furniture.

The postman dropped off a large box with the morning mail, and I knew it contained the racier outfits my masters had purchased online. I shuddered when I realized my master would surely make me model them for him, which might turn him on. Since my asshole was still throbbing from its virgin assault the previous day, the prospect of more of the same brought tears to my eyes — and a shameful stirring in my loins.

Cody called for coffee at half-past ten, and after taking a few sips, he nodded toward the bathroom. “Coffee always makes me pee, Mirabella.” He winked at me. “Ready?”

“Yes, Master.”

“Then, get your sissy ass in the bathroom and kneel by the toilet.”

I curtseyed and rushed to obey. From my position, I could see him lounging on my former soft mattress, enjoying his coffee and watching TV. Finally, he rolled out of bed and strolled my way. I bowed my head and waited for the inevitable.

My master didn’t waste time, whipping out his dick, sticking it in my mouth and releasing a stream of salty, hot piss. It gurgled from my lips, spilling all over my uniform and the tiles below, but Cody didn’t let up, pissing full-force until he was done. Then, he slapped me upside the head.

“You need to learn how to swallow it all, Mirabella.” He smacked me a second time and plopped onto the toilet. “Your uniform is all wet — and look at the floor. Lick that up.”

As I bent over and started tonguing the tiles, my master took a healthy shit, stinking up the bathroom. It was all I could do to keep from gagging, both from licking up piss and the ungodly smell. When he was finished shitting, Cody wiped his ass and said, “Come over here, sissy.”

I shuffled on my knees toward my master. With a smirk, he took the toilet paper he’d just used to wipe his ass, which had a huge chunk of feces on it, and smeared it across my cheek.

“You can wear your wet uniform until the girls come home,” he said, nodding at the mess he’d put on my face. “And don’t wipe that off. It’ll remind you to not let my precious piss go to waste. Don’t you think my piss is precious, sissy?”

“Y-yes, Master.”

“Tell me.”

“Um, Master, it’s like fine wine, sir.” I pushed out more hosannahs to his urine: “It’s better than Michelob beer, sir.”

That got a laugh out of my master. “Get the fuck out of here and finish your cleaning, sissy,” he said when his chuckles had subsided.

“Um, Master, I forgot to tell you: I … I think my other outfits came in the mail.”

He perked up. “Really? Go get ‘em.”

I curtseyed and retrieved the box, which Cody tore open. I recoiled when I saw the sissified outfits. A pink leather collar with several bells on it was also inside. My master was obviously pleased, and he held up a frilly pink teddy with the word “SISSY” emblazoned across the front.

“That one’s kinda sexy,” he said with a leer. “How about you go try it on for Daddy? And put on your new bell collar, too.”

With my stomach aflutter, I curtseyed and rushed to comply. When I tottered back into the bedroom, making my humiliating bells jingle with each step, Cody whistled from his position on the bed, where he lay naked playing with his dick.

“You ready for me to make a sissy out you again, Mirabella?” my master taunted with a twinkle in his eye.

“Master, please … it … it hurts so bad still.”

That only made him laugh. “Aw, look how cute you are, in your pretty little outfit with shit on your face asking me to be gentle. Don’t worry, little sissy. I’ll be gentle with you. Now, get over here and spread them cheeks — show me that pink little butthole.”

With tears in my eyes, I made it to the bed and got into position. Cody spit on his dick and, despite his promise to be gentle, tore into me with fury, making me scream and bawl until my throat gave out. The abuse was made worse by the joyful tinkling of the bells on my collar, which contrasted with my mournful, pitiful wails.

When Cody finally came, he pushed me aside, plopped onto the mattress and pointed at his dick. “Clean,” was his one-word order.

As I sucked the mess from my ass off his massive cock, he sneered. “Now you got shit in your mouth and on your face. How does that make you feel, Mirabella?”

After being humiliated and raped, I was completely defeated as I pulled the dick from my mouth and looked up at my tormenter with tears in my eyes. “I feel … I feel …” Unable to continue, I broke down in convulsions.

Cody chuckled. “Aw, poor, Mirabella. It isn’t easy being a sissy slave, is it?”

“N-no, Master,” I squeaked.

He stroked my hair. “I’ll tell you what. You were a good sissy for Daddy; you can take away the check mark I gave you earlier. How’s that?”

“Um, t-thank you, Master.”

He patted my head. “That’s okay, sissy. I would be nice and let you wash that shit off your face, too, but we’re gonna leave that on there. And go ahead and put on the uniform you got piss all over. You can wear that for the rest of the day, so you’ll remember to swallow whatever I give you. It’s an insult for a sissy to spill a master’s piss all over the place. You know?”

“Um, yes, Master. I’m sorry.”

“That’s okay, sissy. We’re gonna teach you how to be the perfect maid. It’ll be great, I promise. Now, get on with your housework.”

With my soul completely destroyed, I curtseyed to my smug master and limped out of the bedroom, my poor asshole throbbing with each painful step.",4,1740582961.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

Routine.  They had all settled into a routine.  Or rather, the other three had settled into a routine around Jason's and Vincent's shift schedule within a day or so.  Jason woke up, scarfed down a simple breakfast and coffee, spent four hours on the bridge, sometimes alone, sometimes with company, spent four hours relaxing or lifting weights, or helping out in the galley with cleaning, or worked out in the weight room, and then another four hours on the bridge followed by four hours of sleep wherever he could grab it.  The fact that it was a two-man shift made it awkward for everyone else, and tiring for Jason, and he supposed for Vincent too, but they managed.
 
The routine around the two bridge ""officers"" largely centered around the kids trying to maintain a normal sleep schedule despite the four hour life of Vincent and Jason.  Mainly, this was accomplished by finding things to do.  Trandrai tinkered with the tablet, Vai tidied things up and tried to find ways to ""pretty"" the galley and the cabin she shared with Trandrai, and Stowaway… stowaway seemed to mainly just laze about.  Well, maybe not laze about, maybe more keep out of everyone's way.  So, on the forth day, or what Jason was pretty sure was the forth day after the disorienting four-hour life had cycled a few times, Jason confronted him.
 
""Come on, get up.""
 
""And do what?"" Stowaway asked grumpily.
 
""To start with, I haven't seen you exercise.  Come on, let's work out together.""
 
""You're a heavyworlder, I can't go in while you use it,"" Stowaway scoffed.
 
""I'll do cardio and spot you,"" Jason rejoined, ""Up with you, it'll make you feel better.""
 
""Why are you always on my case?""
 
""Because I give a crap,"" Jason said easily, ""now up.""
 
""Bullshit.""
 
Jason was surprised by how much the pang of pity hurt him, and he tried to keep it from his face as he said, ""You don't even know what a bull is.""
 
""I don't need to,"" the avian boy said hotly, drawing nervous glances from the girls.
 
""Well,"" Jason said patiently, ""a bull is a male bovine, usually.  Sometimes it can refer to other animals.""
 
Stowaway flapped his wings in clear frustration as he scoffed, ""Like that has anything to do with you lying.""
 
""What makes you think I don't care?""
 
""Because *nobody* cares,"" Stowaway said before he realized what he admitted to and shrank in on himself.
 
""Come on, just a quick half hour workout, and you'll feel better.  And if I'm wrong you get to say you told me so,"" Jason said with a carefully neutral tone and expression.
 
Stowaway narrowed his eyes in affronted suspicion for a moment before muttering, ""Fine.  Just so I can shut you up.""
 
""That's the spirit,"" Jason said as he cheerily hauled Stowaway up to his talons.
 
Once they were in the privacy of the weight room, Stowaway admitted, ""I don't really know how to 'work out,"" usually I just fly around a nice big atrium on-station or in the open air of a planet.""
 
""Well, you could hold weights in your wing claws to strengthen your wing beats,"" Jason started, or you could use the treadmill or stationary bike for cardio.  I kind of figured you'd know some basic lifts since you've been living shipboard for a couple of years.""
 
Stowaway narrowed his eyes and asked, ""How'd you know that?""
 
Jason prodded Stowaway toward the equipment, and he meandered over to the stationary bike while Jason explained, ""Well, your hiding spot was actually pretty good.  I figure you've hidden on a couple of passenger liners or maybe a hauler or two before.  That, and you said you were on a ship before the *Hearts Long to be Brought Close.*""
 
""I did say that,"" Stowaway said ruefully as he adjusted the saddle for his gangly frame and clambered atop it to begin peddling.
 
Jason mounted the treadmill and said, ""I owe you an apology by the way.""
 
""For what?  Being annoying?""
 
""Nah, I figure I'm lovably insistent.  For your nickname.  I'm sorry I didn't think up a better one.""
 
""I… I like it better than my real name…""
 
""Still.  I should have don-""
 
""You're not what I expected."" Stowaway interrupted suddenly, ""What I expected from… well, from a family of heroes.""
 
The gentle thud-thud--thud-thud of Janson's careful low-G lope and the soft whirring of the stationary bike's internals joined the ever-present hum of *The Long Way's* systems filled the silence between them as it stretched into long seconds.
 
Jason spoke into that silence, ""I told you once, I'm just a kid.""
 
""Jason?"" Stowaway asked, his voice betraying his rare openness, ""What do you think a hero is?""
 
""I… I know I don't want to be one.  I just want to do my bit.""
 
""What if your bit is to be one?""
 
Jason didn't have an answer for that.
 
""Can I ask a different question?"" Stowaway ventured.
 
""I'll do my best to answer,"" Jason said with a forced grin.
 
""Are Sneaky and The Report the same person?""
 
""Aye, they are, but you could get that from any decent history book.  What's your real question?""
 
Stowaway's peddling slowed as the gears in his mind turned until he said, ""Why do you think that Sneaky is a better nickname?""
 
""You remembered that?  Well, it's simple.  It's the kind of nickname a *person* might get.  That, and it's funny.""
 
Four hour life was bullshit.  Vincent couldn't get enough sleep, the meal times all felt off, and there wasn't any time to drink.  Bullshit.  The worst part was he didn't have a better idea.  He was going through too much coffee, and his headache wouldn't go away.  He was nearly desperate enough to waste some of his hoarded medical supplies to quiet the throbbing pain in the base of his skull.
 
*The Long Way's* systems' soothing hum was a roar in his ears as he got up.  The kids, except for the George boy, sometimes sleeping, sometimes working, sometimes watching old movies in the galley all conjured anguishing images of Cal.  The George kid was holding up half the sky, so he couldn't slack his half.  The George kid was probably holding up more than half of the sky, since for some reason Stowaway suddenly went from being aloof and quiet to helping the girls during the times he tried to catch fleeting rest.
 
He was planning on waking the George kid up when they were a day out to see if they could find a way to get the time for some real sleep.  Maybe his cousin could stand to take just one double shift so one of them could get a full eight hours.
 
One mind-numbing blur of uncounted cycles of four-hour life and a proposal later, and the George boy was turning to his cousin and asking, ""Do you think you can do it?""
 
""But…"" she answered slowly, haltingly, ""but I… but I don't… don't have any hours on a sim…""
 
""If we translate into realspace where skilled piloting would be needed, we'd be pasted anyway,"" Vincent rumbled, barely able to keep a pained edge out of his voice.  Hopefully.  Hopefully able to keep a pained edge out of his voice.
 
The George kid shot him a reproachful glance before returning his gaze to his cousin while he said, ""Your job would be to get us to all stop and come and wake one of us.  That's all.  Tran, if you don't think you can do it, I can pull a triple to get Mister Vincent some sleep.""
 
""You're not looking so hot either, kid,"" Vincent nearly snapped.  ""I don't know what's at that system, and I might need my copilot.""
 
""Aye Mister.  That's true,"" the kid said with a testy edge to his voice.  That must have come out more harshly than Vincent had intended.
 
Trandrai drummed the fingers of one hand on the table, clasped two others together beneath the table, and reached for her cousin with another before she fairly whispered,  ""Just once?  And after that, you'll promise to run sims on the copilot yoke for me?""
 
""Child, if you want to turn this four on four off into four on eight off four on, then I'll love you forever.""
 
The George boy made his eyes go wide and said with mock scandal, ""You don't love her already?  Everybody loves Tran.""
 
""I'll love you more than I already do forever,"" Vincent sighed wearily.  Desperately.
 
""Aye,"" she breathed. Then in a hushed whisper she more strongly told them, ""Aye,  I can do it,"" Trandrai said, ""but you have to promise that you aren't gonna do this to yourselves again.""
 
""Promise,"" Vincent and the George Boy said in unison.
 
""Mister Vincent, I think you oughta take something for a headache and get to bed now,"" The George boy suggested softly, ""I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do on your own ship… but you don't look too good.  If I pull the first double, then Tran does, that should give you more time to recover.""
 
""We might need those pills later,"" Vincent mumbled as he stood and took a wobbly step toward his bedroom.  He didn't look back.
 
Once in his room with the door shut behind him, he ignored the haggard, broken-down, beaten man in the reflection and plucked a bottle of whiskey from his supplies in his left hand, and his Rosary in his right.  He looked at the worn wooden crudely carved Crucifix and took a small sip from the bottle.  He ran his thumb over where halting knife marks once were and began softly, ""I believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, Our Lord…""

As soon as my mom left the room, I opened them, pulled down a sleeve of Nespresso pods, and chewed two until I could get all the coffee out. It was delicious! Turns out I love their sweet vanilla flavor. 10/10 highly recommend. 

My mom saw me licking coffee off my bed and she was NOT impressed with my new trick. She had to rush me to the vet where they made me throw up and gave me charcoal and fluids and checked my heart rate every 30 minutes for 12 hours. 

This picture is just as I was about to yell at her for leaving me at the vet. I was pretty annoyed, so when I got home, I decided I should probably try to eat some of her socks. When that didn’t work out, I figured I’d go in the backyard and dig a big muddy hole! After all, I’d just gotten bathed and groomed at the vet because I threw up all over myself. Being clean is overrated. 

Sadly, my reign of pantry terror appears to be over. 
When I went back to the doors to wreak some more havoc, a weird lock was on them and now I can’t open them. How rude. My parents say it’s because they love me so much, but I can’t help but feel like they’re just being party poopers. ",62,1740582353.0,goldenretrievers,5,0.98,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iypdfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1iypdfc/venting_one_month_in/,Venting one month in.,"TLDR: One month in and I’m just venting, I guess.

Today marks one month since the passing of my husband (m32) and our only child (f10) via car accident.

I’m (f32) not sure how I’ve made it this far. There’s that little voice in me that tells me it’s not worth it to stick around. That I’ve no life left without my beloveds. Of course, I’m aware that it’s supposedly not true. I guess there’s people that do want me to keep living.

My friend’s were Rory’s and Millie’s though, and with them gone, they’ve left too. My mum has never had much care for me. Dad died last year at Christmas, and his husband shortly before. My siblings only saw me at the funerals and now don’t answer my calls. Rory’s mum is understandably shattered and struggling. He was her only son. His eldest sister tries to reach out when she has the time.

My Auntie made a massive trip from our homeland of Australia to visit me in the US. She’s been staying here since the second week in and she’s telling me she won’t leave. She lost her husband, my uncle; in March last year, so she knows half of what I’m experiencing and gosh, she’s so supportive. A parent of Millie’s best friend, Maria, has been coming around a couple times a week too, forcing me to eat and just being with me. I think it helps. She lost a very young child years ago, so I guess that covers the other half.

I also have a pregnancy too. I’m 14 weeks along now. That’s the whole reason they left for the car ride. I’ve had two miscarriages and a stillbirth. I wasn’t supposed to be able to get pregnant again and it had been nearly 4 years since the stillbirth. This baby was entirely unplanned. So Rory and Millie left to clear their heads because they were understandably scared. It’s not the bean’s fault. It never will be.

I do feel as though that’s at least one thing to keep fighting for.

I don’t know what I’d do if I lost this baby too though. Like, how could I possibly continue on if I lose this last piece of him? And considering my track record, that chances are concerningly high. I’m being seen by my OB once a week even.

And then there are the bills, lawyers, death verifying phone calls, insurance calls, planning. Like, holy flipping buckets. Last week I had to go over the entire event 9 different times because insurance for both (Rory, UHC and Mils, UHC+Medicaid) kept telling me they need *verbal* retelling, not the letters I’ve sent multiple times. You all can probably imagine how awful it is to have to relive that so many times.

Millie had to be airlifted to the hospital, but she passed away while they were en route. Both companies have decided that they will not accept the claim for that flight even though the service was in-network. This decision was made within record breaking time, mind you. It’s funny how they’ll drag their feet accepting claims but jump at the opportunity to deny them.

Their reasoning is that she was picked up, but didn’t even make it to the hospital, so the measures to save her were unwarranted. They are expecting me to pay over $350k for this now. I’m disabled and unable to work! How is that even a possibility to expect?

Then I have the lawyers.

Our estate lawyer, bless him, who is dealing with all of that, keeping me in the loop, but being so careful about too. Thankfully Rory and I owned everything jointly, but our agent still has to work through life insurance for both Millie and Rory too.

The guy who hit the van because he was speeding so bad and drunk at 9am  on a Saturday morning, who wrecked the vehicle so badly that both my family had to be removed with the jaws of life, is claiming the accident was caused by my HUSBAND. Who has an entirely clean driving record, not a parking ticket, speeding fine, warning; nothing. And Rory was hit on the side, while the other guy was head on.

That guy walked away with only a few broken bones. And the only witness is now staying entirely silent. He is either in cohorts, or being paid off. They haven’t even been able to recover dash cam footage because it didn’t load to an external device and is damaged very badly. I’m still waiting for that to be pulled, a whole month later. But now I have to get a lawyer for this, because the driver is suing me for the “damages caused by my husband”. Who’s dead! I didn’t even know that was a thing you could do! He sure is trying though.

With the news of the airlift denials, now I’m also having to think about hiring a lawyer for the insurance cases! Heaven knows I can’t pay that $350k so my only other option is to try and fight the cases in court.

And I’m not gaining weight for the baby at all. I’m losing it, because stress has me so hard I can’t barely keep food down. I can’t afford my regular medical care now because I’ve been booted from the insurance Rory was on through his work. And I’m on numerous medications that actively save my life, including heart and stomach meds. Those have been a beast to afford. I’m trying to apply for Medicaid (I’m on state provided for pregnancy at least) but that’s going to take a long while, and that’s only if they will allow me on. Medicaid is not available to low/no income adults in my state. Only children, disabled, and elderly. And the process to get on is worse than applying for SSDI.

Then there’s my mum. She never liked Rory. He was “damaged goods” in her eyes, because he was born deaf and uses cochlears. Even though her own *sister* my Auntie, is deaf/mute. And Auntie doesn’t even qualify for any hearing device! Then again, she isn’t on speaking terms with her sister either, go figure. Mum absolutely despised that Millie was adopted and not even the same skin color as me or Rory. Even called Mils “ugly and invalid”, because she was also disabled and occasionally has to use a wheelchair. Millie was only 8! We cut her off, of course.

Well, she called and asked to meet up for coffee on Valentine’s Day, and I thought she was going to apologize, sympathize, share my grief, idk. Something. No. Of course not. That witch tried to set me up on a date with a man who, in her words “is a preferable suitor compared to your last”. It hadn’t even been a full four weeks! And she’s trying to push a new man on me!

Gosh. I’m just so tired. I don’t want to do this anymore. I feel like every time I turn around, there’s another massive issue. I want time to grieve, but I wasn’t even allowed that the couple weeks after. I was still bombarded with everything and everyone. The hospital, insurances, lawyers, doctors, Rory’s work, Millie’s school, everyone wanting death certs and the funeral home wanting to expedite the funerals and cremations.

I’ll be starting grief counseling in two weeks and my Auntie is trying to help me find a therapist I can afford. At this point, I’m not sure if I’m too far gone to recover though.

Anyways, if you’ve read this far, I’m sorry. Please forgive my pining. Writing helps to clear me out.",7,1740581819.0,widowers,6,1.0,False

This was over the course of just 2 months. I’ve struggled with that weight for the last few years and am working towards my goal of 185lbs. Here’s what I’ve done so far to drop the weight.  - Spoiler I didn’t go to the gym

So every morning I have a Slimfast (Carmel Macchiato flavor) which is 180 calories 20g of protein and only 1g of sugar 

For lunch I will have Chipotle or Yogis Grill 

Chipotle - Bowl with double steak, brown rice, pinto beans, and guac that’s it

Yogis Grill - Teriyaki Chicken and rice bowl (regular size) that’s it 

Those are my meals during the week and I don’t eat dinner but if I get hungry at night I might have another slimfast drink

On the weekends I ball out and don’t care what I eat but I don’t over eat - I’ll have burritos, coffee, pastas, burgers, fries, chicken tendies you name it. 

Every night during the week I also go on a 2 mile walk and this is all the exercise I get besides me walking around at work all day. 

It’s obvious that a calorie deficit with higher protein intake is what’s dropping the weight


This is what has worked for me!!! Not overly restrictive and didn’t have to workout at a gym at all (thankfully because I hate the gym) and I’m lazy and don’t like to cook except for on occasion lol",24,1740581707.0,WeightLossAdvice,7,0.85,False

I don't have any problems with it, she told my boyfriend kasi na she wants to befriend me kasi we go to the same school daw. I said yes kaya nagkita kami. During our chikas, palagi niyang sinisingit yung name ng ex ng boyfriend ko which made me uncomfortable. Tinitignan ako lagi ng boyfriend ko kasi alam niya na di ko nagustuhan yun.

1iyp9mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1iyp9mw/this_man_i_cant_and_i_need_to_scream/,This man.. I can't and I need to scream,"My 35M husband and I (38F) have 2 kids, 5yoM and 10moF. Last week were the spring holidays in my country (Netherlands), and of course our son got sick. Spent a few days managing work, the baby and the sick son and then I got sick. Couldn't be sick because baby still breastfeeds and contact naps and then on Saturday night the baby got sick, high fever and constant nursing. I have basically slept maybe 2 solid hours a night total for a few days, I have an important work project that runs until Friday and I'm strung out. My supply is fucked due to baby's constant nursing so I've had to pump for some pressure relief and I'm just overall not a very happy camper right this moment. 

We bedshare with the kids, and again our baby is a contact sleeper who does NOT like her crib. Getting her to sleep in the crib requires effort of the husband because it's hopeless when I try it due to her smelling the milk, and he doesn't want to deal with the tears. The result is that I have to stay with the kids as of baby bedtime otherwise baby wakes up all the time and doesn't get the sleep she needs. Most nights I can solve my lack of me-time by gaming on my portable console in bed when the kids sleep, but I have NO social life. I get that all of this is a consequence of the parenting choices we make together, but it's also not like my husband can take over the nights because when he does and baby gets upset because his nipples are useless he immediately cries for me and I'm too tired right now to deal with anything other than just popping the boob in and settling her. 

Our 5yo is being a 5yo so everything is a fucking struggle and he doesn't listen and he loves to push buttons, especially mine. I've worked less the past months because I was at the end of my rope a few monts ago and lost it on him on the regular and that's not okay. I'm waiting for therapy to start. I'm asking for help. 

Last night was hard. 5yo was tired so the whole bedtime routine was supremely fucked. He pushed my buttons and I sensed how close to losing it I was, so I asked husband to step in. He didn't because he'd just settled the baby. Things escalated somewhat as I had to hold my kid down to brush his teeth and prevent him from trying to kick me and hit me at the same time without hurting him. It was no fun, we talked it out after (me and kiddo), and later on husband and I had a text-convo about him not stepping in when I literally said ""I need your help right now, I need you to step in"". 

Then this morning he has the audacity to walk into the bedroom, after I had another night of feeding baby through her fever and not getting enough rest, and he says ""I'm worried about you"". No fucking shit Sherlock, I'm worried about me too. What would help is if you brough me breakfast or at least fucking coffee, and just took the baby without saying anything. What would help is if you did the fucking manual dishes in the evening when you have 4 glorious hours to yourself without being fucking touched, so I wouldn't have to do them before I cook fucking dinner. What would help is if I didn't have to think through everything in the goddamn house, from the kids' clothing to the grocery orders. But because he also cooks, spends lots of time with the 5yo and manages the morning school run he feels like he's doing 50% and that he's carrying the mental load. 

An hour ago he asked how I was doing with my work time today and if there was room for him to go outside or for a workout because he needed it. I mentioned I still had a few calls to make for work, but then baby woke up so I couldn't reply and next thing I know he texts ""ok I'm going now otherwise there is no time left"" and like.. Why ask if you don't care about the input? And why even mention you are worried about me if you're not going to give me the one window in a day where I could take some personal space? I'm so fucking angry with him and I just can't. I need a break.",17,1740581534.0,breakingmom,1,0.95,False
1iyp8v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iyp8v0/my_neighbors_dog_wont_stop_growing/,My Neighbor's Dog Won't Stop Growing.,"I’m typing this from what’s left of my kitchen, blood soaking my shirt, dripping onto the laptop keys. The table’s cracked, one leg snapped from when it threw me, and the screen’s flickering—6% battery, no power, no hope. Carl's guts smeared on the wall. My arm’s shredded, red streaks climbing from the gash, and outside, the woods growl—deep, close, shaking the busted windows. I’ve got minutes before it finds me. I’m Matt, and this is all I’ve got left to tell you what it did—to Carl, the cops, the whole damn street. Don’t come here. Just know.

It started Sunday, I rent half a duplex off Route 9 in Poughkeepsie, New York—cheap, crumbling, walls so thin I hear my neighbor Carl’s every grunt. He’s a mess—40s, balding, always in a stained Carhartt jacket, stinking of cigarettes and regret. His dog, Brutus, lives in the backyard—a brindle mutt, pitbull maybe, wiry and restless, chained to a stake in the dirt. Sunday night, I heard it pacing—chain clinking, a low huff—longer than usual. I peeked out my bedroom window, blinds rattling, and saw it in the moonlight: head down, shoulders hunched, bigger than I remembered. Carl’s porch light flickered, and Brutus stared up—eyes glinting, too bright, like coins catching flame. I shivered, locked the window, and returned to bed, the clinking fading slowly.

Monday, it got stranger. I left for my warehouse shift at 7 a.m., boots crunching frost, and Carl was out there, hunched over Brutus with a flashlight. “Stay still, you mutt,” he muttered, voice tight, poking at the chain with a stick. Brutus growled—low, guttural, vibrating the fence—and Carl jolted back, stick snapping. I called out, “You good?” He waved me off, shaky, “Yeah, just… antsy.” But the dog looked wrong—taller, legs stretched, fur patchy like it was shedding fast. I drove off, unease gnawing, and worked 10 hours, forklifts humming, boxes thudding, my mind replaying that growl.

Tuesday, the stress kicked in. I got home at 6:30 p.m., the sky bruising purple, and heard a whine—sharp, keening, slicing through the dusk. Carl’s yard light buzzed, and Brutus was pressed against the fence, chain taut, eyes locked on my door. He was bigger—chest broad, ribs showing through thinning fur—and the air stank, sour, and meaty, like roadkill left too long. Carl burst out, shovel in hand, yelling, “Back off, you freak!” He swung; the blade clanged off Brutus’ side, and the dog turned—slow, deliberate—growling so deep my teeth buzzed. Carl’s face went white; he dropped the shovel, stumbled inside, door slamming. I locked up, heart racing, and watched through the blinds as Brutus sat, staring, till midnight, when the light died and the whine stopped.

Wednesday, I cracked. Couldn’t sleep—kept hearing that sound, a loop in my skull—and called in sick, hands trembling around my coffee mug. Mrs. Hensley, the nosy widow across the street, pounded on Carl’s door at 10 a.m., screeching about her cat, “That damn dog ate my Muffin!” No answer. The chain lay coiled in the yard, Brutus gone. I texted Carl—*Where’s your dog?*—nothing back. I paced, floorboards creaking, checking windows every five minutes. At noon, a cop car rolled up—Officers Rodriguez and Kim, badges glinting, voices sharp over the radio. They knocked, waited, got silence. Rodriguez stepped into the yard, flashlight sweeping the shed—wooden, padlocked, still. Kim smirked, “What, he’s hiding it?” Then the lock rattled—soft, once, twice.

Thursday, it broke. I hadn’t slept, eyes burning, coffee cold, when the shed door creaked—slow, hinges whining—at 6 a.m. Rodriguez froze; Kim drew her Glock, “Show yourself!” The wood splintered—slow at first, cracks spidering—then blew apart, shards flying, and Brutus came out. Not a dog anymore. Nine feet tall, fur sloughing off gray, glistening flesh, claws like machetes gouging the dirt. Its jaw unhinged, teeth jagged and red, roaring—a wet, bone-rattling bellow. Rodriguez fired—three shots, muzzle flashing—but the bullets sank into its hide, useless. It swiped; his chest tore open, ribs snapping, blood hosing the fence. Kim screamed, shot twice—sparks, no dent—and it grabbed her throat, lifting, skull popping like a grape, brains smearing the grass.

Carl ran out, shotgun booming—pellets peppered its flank, black ooze trickling—but it turned, 10 feet now, and charged. Claws ripped his gut, intestines spilling, shotgun clattering as it bit—neck gone, head lolling, body slumping. I bolted inside, shoved my dresser against the door, heart slamming. The street erupted—Hensley’s scream cut short, her porch crunching, a cop car crashing, sirens dying. Two more officers ran in, guns blazing—torn apart, limbs scattered, blood pooling in gutters. I peeked: Brutus was 12 feet, eyes glowing red, sniffing my way, claws scraping my siding—slow, deliberate.

It hit at 1 a.m. Front door buckled, wood splintering, and it filled the room—14 feet, a wall of meat, stink like a slaughterhouse. I swung a bat—cracked its jaw, bounced off—but it roared, claw slashing my chest, skin peeling, ribs flashing. I fell, crawled under the sink; it swiped, pipes bursting, water spraying. I threw a pot—clanged its head, bought a stumble—then ran upstairs, blood slicking the steps, barricading my room with a dresser. It tore through—wall exploding, ceiling caving, claws punching holes—and I dove out the window, roof tiles cutting my palms, landing hard—ankle snapping, leg screaming. Limped into the woods, pines whipping my face, collapsing in a ditch till dawn, shivering, bleeding.

Back now, the duplex is rubble—walls gone, Carl’s torso in the yard, cops shredded, blood steaming in the cold. Brutus is out there—tracks gouging the earth, leading off. I’m posting, chest throbbing, fever spiking—red lines creeping from the wound, vision blurring. The woods growl—snaps, snarls, closer. Claw marks scar my floor, wet, moving—*moving*—and the house shakes. I’ve got a knife, no chance. It’s Matt—tell them it’s not a dog. Tell them it’s still growing. I hear it—tearing the trees, roaring—under me now. This is it.",5,1740581476.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

It’s actually slightly comical, every time I use it I can’t get over how wobbly it is, like one of those raggedy doll things. 

Anyway, the parts seem really high quality with a nice finish but the joints are very wobbly. It’s also a bit ‘squishy’? Like when you apply downward pressure it squishes and bounces. 

I have included a few videos showing the wobbliness so you can judge for yourself. In case I wasn’t clear, I personally think it is quite wobbly. 

https://imgur.com/a/s-wobbly-NHtUvwC

The coffee is pretty good though, I’ve been able to get some nice shots. The basket is only 40mm wide, so going above the recommended 15g is problematic and due to the puck height you may need to play around with grind size and pressure. I’ve had good results at slightly lower pressures (6-7bar) which probably makes sense given the physics but there are far more opportunities for things to go wrong I guess. Doesn’t hold much water but enough for a decent shot. Maybe 80ml max, no lungos here. I drink light to medium roasts exclusively, medium to dark will play a bit nicer. I use a 1zpresso J-Ultra grinder. 

The workflow is pretty nice, there aren’t too many parts and clean up is easy, but preheating is slightly annoying (although no worse than other similar devices). 

I don’t regret backing it, despite its wobbliness, it’s a fun machine but I probably won’t travel with it. It’s still pretty heavy and large, and in don’t known if the workflow will travel as well (preheating would be annoying). 

I have included my current travel setup to contrast. It’s a picopresso with some sworksdesign extras (billet basket, magnetic funnel, pancake tamper). Everything fits inside the picopresso other than the funnel thing. And yes I spent more on extras than the picopresso cost. The coffee is absurdly good for the size and weight of the setup. I’ll probably stick with this for now. ",9,1740581244.0,FlairEspresso,4,0.92,False

for those who are feeling bad and leaving yourself behind! Remember, if you are your own person, don’t cover yourself so much, start little by little…

1. What helps me stay healthy throughout the day is exercise or running in the morning, for example, it helps me connect with the outside world without having to socialize a lot with people. It really changes my day.🌻🌄

2. Do everything before the lives like cleaning the house, making food, etc. It helped me to be calmer when I start and end the lives, so after the lives I can have a moment of my own to clean up and then relax and have a coffee 🍭☕

3. Preparing for the live show, how to see the angles, keeping the toys nearby, a book, leaving everything accessible and organized for the live shows helps me prepare for them psychologically.🧠🧸

4. Massage and pelvic exercises in the bath before and after lives helped me not suffer from dryness or burning or pain. If anyone suffers from this, this tip helps a lot.🛀

5. Always try to stay connected with yourself! Doing what you like, it could be hobbies like singing, drawing, etc. The important thing is to have something to remind you who you really are, studying helps me a lot, for example, things that keep you busy outside of live🧘🏻‍♀️

I hope it helps someone and I'd like to hear tips from you too!🌈🫶🏻",3,1740581082.0,CamGirlProblems,0,0.81,False

Sometimes it feels like I get so lost in the currents of work and school that I forget I need to surface and take a breath before diving back in. I get so fixated on the never-ending deadlines and buildup of tasks that small inconveniences feel like I'm being cursed by the universe. It feels just- really unfair because I've been working so hard and I can't even have this small moment to myself.

I finally had some time to do something other than work yesterday so I prepared this browned butter cookie dough with semi sweet and white chocolate chips. I threw a splash of coffee into the dough with the vanilla because I love the way coffee compliments chocolate and balances the sweetness. I also used dark brown sugar instead of white sugar and the whole thing just smells incredible I can't describe it.

I got up extra early today to go bake it because I was so excited, only for the oven's control panel to not work and honestly that was my last straw. It's not the end of the world but it felt like a punch in the face.

jealous about this girl from his past. Wala naman siyang ginagawang reason para mag selos ako but, nagseselos lang talaga ako. He also has this church mate (girl) na bff ng ex niya na always ko pinagseselosan. Last Thursday, we went sa coffee shop here in our city kasi the church mate told my boyfriend that she wants to meet his girlfriend, which is me. I don’t have any problems with it, she told my boyfriend kasi na she wants to befriend me kasi we go to the same school daw. I said yes kaya nagkita kami.

During our chikas, palagi niyang sinisingit yung name ng ex ng boyfriend ko which made me uncomfortable. Tinitignan ako lagi ng boyfriend ko kasi alam niya na di ko nagustuhan yun. Every time she mentions the girl’s name, tumitingin siya palagi sa akin. She even said na she doesn’t see me often sa school or maybe she just don’t notice me kasi iba daw ang mukha ko in person! Every time kasi na nagpo-post ako sa instagram ko, I always wear make up kasi mahilig ako! Girl, di ba uso make up sa kaniya? Huhu, I was offended talaga!

The next day, I told my friends about what happened in our meeting. They told me na what the church mate did was disrespectful and I agree naman. They said na maybe the girl did it on purpose, at baka nga my boyfriend’s ex knew about our meeting and they planned it all along.

I'm so sick of the foods I like hurting me. Most all chips, skittles, almost every canned drink, peanuts, peanut butter, even fricking carbonated water among many others.

Why does my country allow this? Xanthines are addictive drugs with health consequences, but since everybody uses nobody cares. They think it's just me. That they're fine and im just weird and don't know what im talking about. 

So quit. Quit and see what our food does to you. Many would be surprised of the world you wake up into once you recognize the poison that is caffeine and its related compounds. 

It's all because xanthines make food and drink taste better, it's just to increase sales. I know why it's done. I just hate it. I hate losing time because I have to recover from the recipe of my favorite snack now including a drug that makes me feel like crap. 

If you're intention is to debate me on this please save us the time and don't bother. Don't try and gaslight me into doubting my own senses because you aren't comfortable with my words. If you're one of the fortunate ones who aren't sensitive to caffeine, great. I'm happy for you. This post isn't for you. Enjoy having the negative health effects even if you can't feel it happening. I'm so done with every caffeine user using the same victim blaming bootlicking deflection tactics. 

I know my experience isn't common, but I view myself as a canary in the coal mine who is suffocating while the miners ignore her. We are all being subjected to these drugs because it makes us spend more money. It's a symptom of the endless profit seeking every facet of our society is being hollowed out by. 

Don't take a break, drink coffee. Don't be sad about your job, drink monster. Don't be unhappy about the state of the world and your place in it, have some chocolate. Hungry for a snack? A sizable portion of foods are a lot more tasty for no clear reason, and that other stuff doesn't satisfy you right? You want BRAND with drugs right?

1iyoucx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1iyoucx/could_the_delonghi_la_specialista_arte_evo/,Could the De'Longhi La Specialista Arte Evo Espresso Machine Revolutionize Your Coffee Routine? An In-Depth Review,"Testing the De'Longhi La Specialista Arte Evo Espresso Machine, model EC9255M, has been a daily adventure into the art of coffee-making. As someone who takes their morning coffee ritual seriously, this machine promised a lot: built-in grinder, cold brew capabilities, and advanced milk frothing—features that could tempt any home barista. After weeks of use, I can say it brings both joy and a few hiccups.

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**  
The commercial-style steam wand on this machine is a revelation. It heats up quickly and pumps out just the right amount of steam to create velvety, smooth microfoam. I’ve experimented with various milk types, and it nails that creamy texture perfect for latte art. My attempt at a tulip design? Let’s just say it’s a work in progress, but the wand’s precision makes it easier to improve every day. However, beginners might find the manual frothing process a bit tricky to master initially.

**Coffee Quality**  
The quality of the espresso produced is impressive. The 15-bar Italian pump ensures consistent pressure, delivering rich, full-bodied espresso shots with a golden crema. I tried beans from several roasters—medium and dark roasts—and the flavors came alive in every cup. The cold brew feature is another standout, extracting delicious iced coffee in under five minutes. While regular espresso machines don’t usually offer this, it’s a game-changer for iced coffee fans like me.

[Check De'Longhi La Specialista Arte Evo Espresso Machine price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0cczqcnlj/)

**Design & Build Quality**  
Its stainless steel finish gives it a sleek, modern look that complements any kitchen. The compact design is practical, especially for smaller kitchens like mine. At first glance, it appears robust, and after weeks of use, I can confirm it’s built to last. Small details, like the inclusion of a tamping mat and dosing funnel, show attention to user convenience.

**Features**  
With four beverage presets—espresso, Americano, cold brew, and hot water—this machine has something for everyone. The conical burr grinder allows for eight grind settings, giving you control over how fine or coarse your grounds are. The active temperature control with three settings ensures water infusion matches your beans perfectly, enhancing flavor extraction. I also appreciated the barista kit, which included a tamper and milk frothing jug, making it feel like a professional setup.

**Water Tank & Capacity**  
The water tank is reasonably sized, holding enough for several cups before needing a refill. It’s easy to remove and clean, which saves time. However, I wish it had a water level indicator visible from the front. It’s a small oversight but would be helpful during busy mornings.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**  
Cleaning this espresso machine is straightforward. The removable drip tray and bean hopper make maintenance manageable. The machine even comes with a cleaning needle for the steam nozzle, which I’ve had to use a couple of times. Still, the built-in grinder’s hopper doesn’t detach for cleaning, which could be a hassle over time.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**  
This coffee maker operates relatively quietly compared to others I’ve used. The grinder does produce some noise, as expected, but it’s not disruptive. In terms of energy efficiency, it powers down automatically after a period of inactivity, which is a thoughtful addition.

**Warranty & Support**  
The warranty support, unfortunately, leaves room for improvement. Reading online reviews, I noticed some users struggled with resolving issues like grinder malfunctions. Personally, I haven’t had to contact support, but it’s worth noting for potential buyers who value strong after-sales service.

**Advantages**

* Built-in grinder with eight grind settings.
* Cold brew capability in under five minutes.
* Compact and stylish design.
* Powerful steam wand for latte art.

**Areas for Improvement**

* Grinder hopper doesn’t detach for cleaning.
* Warranty support could be more responsive.
* Front-visible water level indicator is missing.

**Peer Products**  
Comparing this machine to similar options like the Breville Barista Express, I noticed the De'Longhi offers cold brew—a feature the Breville lacks. On the other hand, Breville’s grinder seems more robust and easier to clean. The Nespresso Creatista Plus is another competitor, excelling in ease of use but falling short on customization compared to this machine. Each has its strengths, but the De'Longhi stands out for its versatility and barista tools.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering the range of features, this espresso machine delivers solid value. While it’s an investment, the built-in grinder, cold brew option, and included accessories reduce the need for additional purchases. For coffee enthusiasts who enjoy experimenting, it’s worth every penny.

Read This Review!,"Testing the Waterdrop WD-G2P600-W Reverse Osmosis System was an intriguing experience. As someone who prioritizes clean and safe drinking water, trying out this under-sink filtration system felt like diving into a world of high-tech purification. Over the past few weeks, I’ve been putting it to daily use, and here’s a detailed review outlining its strengths, weaknesses, and how it compares to other options in this space.

**Ease of Installation & Use**

Installing the Waterdrop WD-G2P600-W was thankfully hassle-free. The instructions were clear, and I didn’t even need external help. I managed to set it up in under 30 minutes, which is a win for someone like me with minimal plumbing experience. Its twist-and-pull filter replacement design makes maintenance incredibly straightforward. My sister, who lives nearby, even borrowed my help to install hers after seeing how compact and neat this system looked under my sink. The tankless design was a standout feature, leaving me with plenty of room for other essentials. However, I did have to install an electrical outlet under the sink, which added a slight complication.

[Check Waterdrop WD-G2P600-W price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b08746m1nx/)

**Filtration Technology & Effectiveness**

The Waterdrop WD-G2P600-W Reverse Osmosis System employs a 7-stage filtration process, which sounds impressive—and it is. It effectively removed impurities, with my TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) meter showing levels as low as 2 ppm after filling a jug. That’s incredibly close to bottled water quality. My coffee tasted better, my cooking seemed fresher, and my kids loved the clean taste straight from the tap. However, I noticed that when the faucet was initially turned on, the TDS levels were slightly higher, so letting it run briefly was necessary for optimal results.

**Flow Rate & Performance**

One of the first things I noticed was the system’s impressive flow rate. It fills a 200ml cup in just 8 seconds, making it perfect for hydrating quickly or filling up pots for cooking. Unlike traditional systems that slow down after lengthy use, this one remained consistent. That said, my neighbor, who uses the same model, mentioned that the flow rate isn’t as strong when connected to a refrigerator water dispenser. She had to purchase an additional bypass accessory to resolve the issue.

**Capacity & Suitability**

With a capacity of 600 gallons per day, this system is more than sufficient for my family’s needs. Whether it’s drinking, cooking, or even rinsing fruits and veggies, it handles everything seamlessly. My parents, who have a larger household, are even considering replacing their current bulky purification system with this sleek alternative.

**Filter Lifespan & Replacement**

Each filter lasts quite a while, reducing the frequency of replacements. I appreciated the system’s indicator lights that notify you when it’s time for a change. It’s a small but thoughtful feature that takes the guesswork out of maintenance. Replacement filters are reasonably priced and easy to find, which is another big plus.

**Certifications**

The Waterdrop WD-G2P600-W is FCC Listed and made with lead-free materials, which adds an extra layer of confidence for health-conscious users. Knowing that the system adheres to strict safety standards was a big selling point for me.

**Warranty**

This product comes with a one-year warranty, which should cover any initial defects. While I haven’t had to make use of it, the company’s responsive customer service gives me peace of mind should anything go wrong.

**Merits**

* **Compact Design:** The tankless feature saves valuable under-sink space.
* **High Efficiency:** A 2:1 pure-to-drain ratio minimizes water waste.
* **Quick Installation:** User-friendly setup process.
* **Impressive Filtration:** Delivers water with ultra-low TDS levels.
* **Indicator Lights:** Convenient reminders for filter replacements.

**Caveats**

* **Electrical Outlet Requirement:** May necessitate additional installation under the sink.
* **Initial TDS Levels:** A brief flush is needed for optimal filtration.
* **Faucet Build Quality:** The included faucet feels a bit flimsy compared to the system’s premium features.
* **Refrigerator Compatibility:** Additional accessories may be required for seamless integration.

**Competitive Options**

Comparing the Waterdrop WD-G2P600-W to similar systems, such as the APEC ROES-50 or the iSpring RCC7, reveals some interesting contrasts. While the APEC model is a budget-friendly option, it lacks the high flow rate and compact design of the Waterdrop system. Meanwhile, the iSpring unit, although robust, is bulkier due to its tanked design. The Waterdrop excels in convenience and water-saving technology, though its upfront cost might deter some.

**Bang for the Buck**

Although not the cheapest on the market, the Waterdrop WD-G2P600-W offers incredible value for its features. The reduced water wastage, high-quality filtration, and space-saving design make it worth the investment. I’ve already noticed a drop in my bottled water expenses, which adds to its overall cost-effectiveness.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\

\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\

Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \

Losing my coffee to only find it when it is cold, which for some reason just drives me crazy and spilling my damn water, EVERYWHERE!

TA DA! Spillproof water bottle and a super travel mug for my coffee.

I have been searching and searching for a good spill proof large water bottle. If I have to refill too often, that just won't happen and I don't drink enough. Enter Brumate. Holy shit guys, this thing does NOT leak. I have tossed it down the hall, walked with it upside down and the cat was kind enough to knock it off the table for me. ZERO SPILLAGE! 

And for my coffee I found Zojirushi coffee mug. I originally bought one for my husband.  He goes to work at 1am and gets home around 3pm. His coffee was still hot when he got home. (He had left it in his car in 20F degree weather all day by mistake.) So I got the 20oz for myself. This thing has a collapsible handle and is spill proof too!! So now I am walking around with a travel mug just doing my thing. And if I leave it in a room and search for it and hour or two later, this damn thing is still hot.

I have ROCD and go in and out of severe flare ups. Married for 11 years. And I just read Rainbow Rowell's Slow Dance, because I love to read and I used to read love stories, and I was like, ""I can handle this."" No I can't. NO I CAN'T. I triggered the shit out of myself.

It's a will-they-won't-they, second chance love story about two people who were in love in high school (though neither could be honest about their feelings) and then things fell apart and they didn't speak for fifteen years. And now they have met again and re-kindled things, and they are OBSESSED WITH EACH OTHER. Obsessed, we are soul mates, we can't get enough of each other, we are totally sexually compatible and sexually obsessed with each other and physically can't get enough of each other's bodies, and just...like two addicts rotating around each other. Almost like the scene in Bridgerton where what's-his-face played by Jonathan Bailey basically can't get enough of the girl he likes's pheromones and is just following her around trying to breathe her in and you get the sense that he'd stick his face in her armpit if he could.

One of my big triggers is me and my husband have been together for 11 years and his libido is lower than mine and we have sex not as much as I want to, and I don't feel like he desires me enough. 

That said, here are the facts:   
\-we do have sex at least once a week, which is more than some people are having (and also who cares how much sex other people are having?)

\-he does say that he wants me and finds me desirable

\-we just had our first child who is now 18 months old, and we are both exhausted all the time, and it is hard to find time/energy for physical intimacy, especially for him - when he is tired he doesn't feel as sexy, though when I am tired, I still do. 

Anyway, y'all - there are no red flags in our relationship, I do love him, he is the sweetest to me. He is trustworthy, kind, has never said a mean word to me in our entire marriage (ever), he is an incredible dad and loves our little girl, he works on our relationship, he listens to me, he wants the best for me, he is a hard worker. He brings me coffee in bed every morning. When I am going to take a shower, he always goes and puts a dry towel in the door for me. Last night, he asked if I wanted to go lay in the hammock with him and listen to the spring peepers after we put our daughter to bed.

  
But, he isn't my sexually-obsessed-with-me-high-school-boyfriend so apparently I can't just enjoy my goddamn husband because ROCD wants to ruin my fucking life. I am 44 years old. When will I GROW UP.",6,1740579934.0,ROCD,4,0.88,False
1iyootn,https://v.redd.it/1z00w6mnthle1,Munnar Trip: Everything You Need to Know,"Munnar is one of the most beloved destinations for travelers. Visitors to Munnar mainly explore two primary routes:

1.	Top Station – Vattavada Route

2.	Marayoor – Kanthalloor Route

Additionally, there is a third route:

Visitors must park their own vehicles and take a mini-bus operated by the forest department. The entry fee for adults is ₹200. However, spotting the Tahrs is a matter of luck. Many visitors feel disappointed if they don’t see them, but the journey itself is a great experience. The route passes through forests, tea plantations, and waterfalls, leading to one of the highest accessible points in Kerala. If traveling with kids, carry food and water, as hunger is certain on the return journey. There is a small coffee shop at the top.

From here, you can continue towards Kanthalloor, which is famous for its fruit farms. You can also experience off-road safaris to Bhramaram Viewpoint.


**3.Devikulam – Chinnakanal – Poopara – Thekkady Route**

2. If you stir your grounds while brewing, what do you use? A random spoon out the drawer or do you have a dedicated grounds stirring device? If so, what is it? I read a comment of someone saying they use a chopstick and that seems like a good idea! 

3. My old coffee maker had a detachable water reservoir so I would always just take that to the fridge to fill up. But, as we know, the Moccamaster does not do that, so now I need to use another container to fill it up. Looked in my cabinet and I realized, I don’t have another container large enough to fill up the 10 cup reservoir completely in one go! I’m lazy and crunched for time in the morning, I  don’t want to make two trips to fill up the reservoir. What do you use??

## Understanding Your Needs: Choosing the right type of Portable Patio Heater

Before diving into specific models, it's crucial to understand the different types of portable heaters for outdoor use and which one best suits your requirements. The primary options include propane, electric, and natural gas (though natural gas is less frequently found in truly portable models) and infrared patio heaters. Each type has its own set of advantages and disadvantages.

**Propane Patio Heater Portable:** Propane heaters are perhaps the most common type of portable outdoor patio heater. They operate by burning propane gas, providing a significant amount of heat. They are typically freestanding patio heaters, making them easy to position and move around. The heat output is high, making them ideal for larger outdoor spaces. Though, they require a propane tank, which needs to be refilled or replaced periodically. Safety is also paramount with propane heaters; adequate ventilation is essential. be on the lookout for units with safety shut-off features that automatically turn off the heater if it tips over.

**Electric Patio Heater Portable:** Electric patio heaters offer a cleaner and more convenient alternative to propane. they plug into a standard electrical outlet and produce heat using electric coils or infrared technology.Electric patio heaters are generally quieter and produce no emissions,making them suitable for enclosed or semi-enclosed spaces. Within the electric category, you'll find options like the electric patio heater portable and portable infrared patio heater, both efficient in directing heat to a concentrated area. While electric models are typically more energy efficient patio heater options in the long run compared to propane, their heating capacity might be less than comparable propane heaters. Additionally, you'll need to ensure you have access to an electrical outlet and consider the unit's power consumption.

**Tabletop Patio Heater:** The appeal of a tabletop patio heater comes from its compact size and portability. These models are designed to sit on a table or other elevated surface, providing targeted warmth to those seated nearby. They are generally powered by propane or electricity and are a great portable heater for outdoor seating for smaller gatherings. Tabletop heaters are perfect for restaurants with limited patio space or homeowners who want to create a cozy outdoor seating area.

**Portable Infrared Patio heater:** Infrared heaters emit radiant heat,which directly warms objects and peopel without heating the surrounding air. This makes them highly efficient and effective, especially in windy conditions since the heat isn't easily blown away. Both electric and propane models can utilize infrared technology, making them versatile options for different needs. They provide instant heat, making them ideal for quickly warming up an outdoor space.understanding these essential differences will help you narrow down your choices when considering the best portable patio heater for your specific application.

## Key Considerations when Choosing a Portable Patio Heater

Once you've decided on the type of portable patio warmer that suits you best, it's time to consider other essential factors. These factors will help you select a heater that is safe,efficient,and meets your specific requirements.

**BTU (British Thermal Units) or Wattage:** BTU measures the heat output of propane or natural gas heaters, while wattage measures the power consumption of electric heaters. The higher the BTU or wattage, the more heat the unit produces. It is indeed essential to choose a heater with sufficient heat output for the size of your outdoor space. Restaurant patio heater needs will likely exceed those for residential use.

**Safety Features:** Safety should always be a top priority when dealing with any heating appliance. Look for features such as automatic shut-off (tip-over protection), overheat protection, and cool-touch housings. Ensure the heater you choose is certified by a recognized safety institution (e.g., CSA, UL).

**Weather Resistance:** If you plan to use the heater outdoors regularly, it's crucial to choose a weatherproof patio heater. Look for models with rust-resistant finishes and durable construction that can withstand the elements.A heavy duty portable heater is especially crucial if you anticipate frequent movement and perhaps rough handling.

**Portability and Storage:** Consider the size and weight of the heater, as well as whether it has wheels or handles for easy transport. If storage space is limited, look for models that can be easily disassembled or folded down. After all, the ""portable"" in ""portable patio heater"" directly implies the ease of movement.

**Fuel Efficiency:** In the long run,fuel efficiency can significantly impact the overall cost of operating the heater. Look for models with adjustable heat settings or energy-saving features to minimize fuel consumption. Also, an energy efficient patio heater conserves resources while saving money.

**Aesthetics:** While functionality is essential,the appearance of the heater should also be considered,especially for commercial applications. Choose a model that complements the style of your outdoor space. Sleek stainless-steel designs are popular for modern restaurants, while more traditional styles might be suitable for homes.

**Cost and Budget:** Determine your budget for a portable patio heater and stick to it. While it's tempting to opt for the cheapest option, keep in mind that quality and durability are worth investing in the long run.Also,factor in the ongoing cost of fuel or electricity for the heater. Consider exploring ""affordable patio heater"" options if budget is a primary concern.

1iyoltb,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1iyoltb/hear_me_out_on_this_white_lodge_theory/,Hear me out on this White Lodge theory:,"I watched through the first series recently and the movie and I can't believe that the White Lodge isn't represented in the storyline... Unless it actually is. I'm convinced that the RR is really the White Lodge. Consider the hints from it being hidden in plain sight. 

The smell of the black lodge is burnt motor oil. Cooper smells the coffee and it is a damn fine cup of coffee. Same color, but equally opposite.

The RR has a checkerboard floor. The floor of the Black Lodge is a Chevron; which is a symmetrical distortion of squares.

Although more subtle, the ice cream cone is a welcoming statue and has prominence above everything else there. The statues in the Black Lodge are cold and detached. 

The RR seems to be where everyone falls in love with each other. It is the White Lodge that is the place where love grants entry  The Black Lodge, it is fear that grants entry.

The miracle of Gordon's hearing, the reconciliation of Briggs and Bobby, Cooper and Annie... there are so many aspects of love that occur there. 

Im also taking into account for the above that Windham Earle was able to enter the RR. The love he had for his wife would make this possible. 

It just makes sense to me that for as important as the Black Lodge is to the show, the White Lodge would have to be equally so and the RR is the only logical place this could be. I haven't seen the new season yet... after the second season finale and the movie on consecutive nights, I needed a minute for my jaw to completely recover from how far it dropped. This was my first watch thru and I'm going back to it to see if I can debunk my own claim here. What evidence do you guys have to either debunk or add to my theory? I'm not concerned about spoilers. I have read plenty of scripts before seeing a show. ",75,1740579691.0,twinpeaks,23,0.99,False
1iyol83,https://www.reddit.com/r/thepassportbros/comments/1iyol83/the_wall_of_text_of_central_asia_from_someone_who/,The Wall Of Text Of Central Asia (from someone who actually lived in these places).,"So, I wanted to take the time a write up a post because between the recent map and the some other posts I’ve seen here a lot of people seem to not be super well informed about Central Asia. I am going to include in depth information about Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia (from Kazan to Novosibirsk), and the added benefit of Mongolia. I have dated women from both Turkmenistan and Tajikistan but I have not stayed in either country so cannot give an honest review of what life was like in either one of these. This is going to be as a White American. My darker brothers, you are going to have a harder time everywhere but Mongolia and Russia.



Lets begin by the general CIS attitude of dating. There are a lot of men on here that say Russian women and Ukrainian women are only after money. There are of course some women who do care about your wallet size, but generally this comes from a more traditional lifestyle that creeps across most of the CIS. As a man you are expected to earn because for women they are likely going to prefer to stay at home and raise the family. So, women will judge you based on your wallet in this way. The women also are looking for you to be the man. Their fathers grew up and were a plumber, electrician, carpenter, mechanic, and so much more. So, they are going to hold you up to the same standard and honestly for most cases, it’s easy with YouTube to quickly at least seem like you know what you are doing for most things around the home. You should at least TRY before you tap out and call the plumber, my girlfriends have thought I was super manly for going and and unclogging the shower drain with just some powder, so make sure you at least put in some effort for maintaining the house.



The above two are generally expected of most men, maybe you might find a girl who attended university in the West and might be softer on these geneal rules but this next part, you should just generally do. First date should have three main parts. Flowers (a small cheap bunch of them is fine), a sit down dinner at somewhere that you can have a glass of wine or kettle of tea, and a taxi to and from the date. She likely put a lot of effort into getting ready to meet you and these three things show that you are putting the same equal effort. Flowers will be a regular purchase with these women for your entire relationship.



Once you do begin dating these women, be ready to actually provide. It is the standard, as the man you are going to pay to keep up her appearance. She is going to ask for a transfer to pay for her nails, hair, spa, makeup, shoes, clothes, etc. Now know the difference when this is acceptable though. This is after you are both on the same page that you are in a relationship and actively dating. If she is asking for all of this after the first date, she’s looking for a free ride and you should drop her and find another.



Now, if you’re a guy here just looking to play the field. Most of the above advice can be ignored as it is more for a serious relationship. You’re going to strike out frequently in this part of the world with casual, but you will get some homers more frequent than in the West. My advice to increase your chances for this is simply dress like a gentleman, blazer and nice shirt with nice slacks and some loafers will carry you far. Also pick up as much Russian as you can. This will make it easier for short term flings.



On the subject of language, if you are coming to this part of the world and you do not speak at least conversational Russian, you are excluding yourself from 80% of the population immediately. There are some cases that it is higher but, I’ll get into that per country basis. Sit down and learn the language.



Let’s start with what I consider the easiest country in the world to find a bride. Uzbekistan. I’ve had Russians tell me that their mothers have told them to go to Uzbekistan and find a bride because if you can’t get married in Uzbekistan, you’ll never get married. I’d say that is true. Uzbekistan is not so much of a party place but it is developing rapidly and changing. Islam is the main religion. So, I would not go during Ramadan as the country becomes very quiet and dating will be nearly impossible. Dating apps are not going to work here, you are going to get pros off the apps. Instagram is much better, search up the Tashkent location and begin liking posts of women you are interested in before you arrive. You will likely get some mutual likes back and can set up meetings before you arrive. Outside of Tashkent, it’ll be a bit more difficult as it is a lot more strict religiously but there are some areas like Samarkand that you can get some success on Instagram too. If you like nightlife, avoid BlaBla in Tashkent, it’s another nest of pros, try SMI and 7 Fridays. There is also Bourbon but it’s a summer hang out. For your short term casual flings, they happen but they are a lot more difficult here. Uzbek girls are very serious in what they want. I dated a girl who was a Perisan opera singer and she was willing to throw away her career to get married and have kids in six months. Another was similar but wanted to get married and move to Bukhara near her parents and have kids. They move FAST. However, there are a lot of Russian & Ukrainians too since the war and you can expand your options this way too for a slower moving relationship. English levels here are VERY low. If you come just armed with English and no Russian, you have cut out 90% of the population easily. As an American there is a lot of interest in you and everyone wants to know you, so be sure to leverage your exotic factor.



Next lets move to the one that everyone seems to be an expert on but obviously has not stayed long in, Kazakhstan. I spent the most time in Kazakhstan out of all of Central Asia. Kazakhstan is also a Islam majority. However, Kazakhstan is a bit different in that the majority of the population does everything but eat pork, but still very quiet during Ramadan. Kazakhstan is a mixture of casual and serious relationships. You can find casual much easier than Uzbekistan but there is racism involved. The south of Kazakhstan is very racist and even as a white man, you will deal with it. I had men approach my dates and tell them they are shameful to be with a foreigner over a Kazakh. I know a black friend who got into fights and a Chinese-American friend who also got into fights. Racism is hardcore in the south. However, Almaty is the place to be. I love Astana but it’s drab and boring by compare. Almaty has the best nightlight and while I said avoid BlaBla in Uzbekistan, BlaBla in Almaty is crazy good, there’s plenty of lounges to take dates to and then bounce back to your apartment. Girls here seem to be more interested in casual with Westerners as I’ve had several times a girl tell me, we cannot date due to my parents but we can have fun. Now, being forth coming, I did end up with a kid from my time in Kazakhstan and I know at least three guys who ended up with an STI, so be sure to be careful. I can afford to pay for my kid, but if you’re not able to don’t be stupid. American factor here is lower than Uzbekistan, you’re not as impressive, there is still some interest but it’s mostly that they can have flings with you in secret and not get judge. However, if you pick up some Kazakh and know of Kazakh culture, you become marriage material for a lot of the population as parents will brag they have a son in law who is foreigner, speaks Kazakh, AND knows the culture. English levels are higher so you can go further with just English but you’re still knocking out 70-75% of the population without English. If you got more time and are looking for something serious, go hit up Karaganda and Pavlodar or Oskemen. For the meeting of women, Tinder and Bumble is probably the best for online dating and going to a lounge or club is the way.



Next up in Kyrgyzstan. This country is hard to say much about because it is difficultly easy. It is difficult to get past the initial barrier but once sort of figure it out, you can get into stride quickly. The country again is majority Muslim. They are a very mixed bag here. A cross between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan in religious strictness. I spent around 1 year total in Kyrgyzstan so that’s the least amount of time since 2008 in my travels. Kyrgyzstan is a bit rougher around the edges, you have to be be more alert and keep your eyes open especially around the bazaars as I’ve seen big brawls break out suddenly. And if you’ve ever been to Suzie Wong in Bishkek’s clubbing scene, you probably saw Max the 300 pounds of pure Kyrgyz muscle decide to whap someone in the face for not being polite to him. However, Kyrgyzstan dating is rather enjoyable. The girls are probably the most down to earth of Central Asia and most relaxed. They want to get married but they do not make you feel pressured to go get married tomorrow. Dating flows naturally, though they did seem to try and move into my apartment quickly but I believe that comes from living with friends or sisters when they come from outside Bishkek. Bishkek is a bit drab and boring itself, but there’s plenty to do if you speak Russian (see a trend? STOP BEING LAZY LEARN RUSSIAN). American factor here is okay, there’s a lot of international universities so a lot of foreigners of all types. There is a coffee shop next to the Russian Embassy called Sierra Coffee, you can go in there and almost everyone is speaking English, it’s right on Manas so a great place to meet people and their food isn’t bad. They are a bit more racist like Kazakhstan but.. it’s mostly aimed at Indian/Pakistani people and just last year there was a big event where Kyrgyz were dragging them from the universities and beating them. So, it is more violent there. The one thing you can’t beat about Kyrgyzstan though is if you love nature, the nature is incredible and Issykul is a super cool spot to go chill. I went to Osh too and it’s interesting but rough too and the road to get there is scary so wear brown pants if you go, but the views going to it are really great. Try to meet the women on Tinder, Bumble isn’t very popular and Instagram a lot of Kyrgyz have closed profiles so it’s difficult to find anyone to like.



Moving onto Russia, I’m currently in Kazan so I’ll talk about this area but Russia outside of Moscow is great. It’s the “real Russia” as most Russians will tell you. Kazan is proof that Muslims and Christians can live together peacefully. It’s a big split between the ethnic Slavs and Tatars so you get really diverse people. Dating here is probably the best I’ve had anywhere else in “Central Asia” (I know, it doesn’t really qualify but it’s so close to Kazakhstan I count is). Being a foreigner here definitely has a factor of being interesting but English levels are basically ZERO. You have to be able to speak Russian to an extent. I’d say I’m only B2 in Russian and I am pretty okay getting around. Partying here is on a smaller scale but it’s still enjoyable to go out and have drinks and watch your girlfriend have fun and dance. There is an edge as it is Russia but it doesn’t feel dangerous, just like you need to be more aware of whats going on. Not many other foreigners so building a social circle is a bit more difficult too, but again speaking Russian can help you get adopted by a slav friend circle. It’s hard to talk about more without revealing who I am as there’s few Americans here in Kazan so I’ll leave it open to questions later.



Finally, lets move onto Mongolia. It’s the first one that isn’t Muslim on the list. Mongolia is incredible for dating. If I hadn’t found Kazan, I’d say UB is #1. The women in Mongolia are gorgeous. When they are going on a date with you, they dress like they are going down the runway. I spent 2 years in UB working for some mining projects and I thought for sure, I’d get married in Mongolia. The apps don’t work here, you’re going to need to go on foot in the city to meet women. You cannot lean on the internet for much, because like Kyrgyzstan it’s a lot of closed profiles. However, the dating is also very toxic in UB in some ways. Cheating from everyone is common. It happened not only to me but the other guys I worked with who were foreigners. The men are very protective of their girls. They might not say anything to you but when a Mongolian girl is cuddle up on your arm in a booth, you can feel the stares of the men. They might say things to her on the street that are rude too. So, be aware of this. English is okay, I wouldn’t say it’s bad or good just simply okay. Russian helps a little in understanding Mongolian but you will be shut out to most of the population. Also UB as a city should be AVOIDED during Winter. I swear my lungs never recovered after 2 winters in UB. A lot of families burn coal stoves and it just hovers over the city during the winter and it’s like smoking a mouthful of cigarettes. But, with all of the above negatives stated, if you can get past them and get yourself someone loyal, Mongolian girls are great. Plus UB can be a fun city during the summer there is so much to do. Play festival during the summer is a fun time and again you get to see such an interesting style on the women.

Context: (PLS DO NOT REPOST) 
Pangalawang beses ko na 'to na experience, na ginawa ako kabit. 

First, naging friends tapos naging ka talking stage na (more than 5months) eventually naging kalandian ko (after a yr knowing him for so long, pero on and off kami) tapos nalaman ko lang na naging side chick ako kasi  nagtext siya sakin tapos nakita daw ng jowa niya convo namin. Eh nung time na yon sinisingil ko lang naman siya sa utang niya sakin na pera. (Opo pinautang ko siya, bait ko kasi). Binlock ko na siya sa lahat ng socials ko at di ko na po singil. Tangina niya. Panglamay niya nalang yon. (Yoko na idetalye pero yan ang short story)

After 3 years? Or 4 na ata, which is ngayon. Sa ibang tao ko naman na experience ulit. I meet this guy nung November or December 2024 and ask me out in a date. Pumayag ako since gusto ko mag try mag date uli at sa stranger hindi yung from friends.

We hit it off instantly. Di pa nga ko makapaniwala kasi di naman ako kagandahang babae at di rin ako masyado magaling makipag socialize. All I know I'm a good listener. For this guy, mabilis ako naging comfortable sakanya. At first dami ko talaga doubts at nakikiramdam ako kung interested ba talaga sakin or need lang ng kausap. But after namin umalis which is nag coffee date, mas naging madalas na siya makipag usap sakin sa chat hanggang mas nakilala namin isa't isa (well yun ang akala ko). - (sa chat lang dahil busy siya sa business niya at busy ako sa internship + review+ side hustle kaya I really don't have much time for date)

Next na pagkikita, masnaging clingy siya sakin, ako naman si tanga, nag assume!!! Akala ko talaga may interest siya. Kaya iniisip ko how to ask him indirectly if there's really something between us or delulu ko lang 🙃

Days passed by after namin magkita, siningit ko in-between our chats how his previous relationship ended. Dun ko nalaman na kabit pala 'ko. May 9 years siya karelasyon na on and off at kaya niya lang daw ako inaya dahil, nabaitan siya sakin at gusto niya lang daw lumabas. 🙂 After ko malaman, kinonsensiya ko siya na sabihin niya gf niya yung ginawa niya. And I told him never talk to me again. 

Tangina biktima din ako, di lang yung karelasyon niyo yung niloloko niyo. Pati yung ginagamit niyo ibang tao, na genuine yung pakikitungo sa inyo, tapos ganito isusukli niyo? Masakit? OO. I AM DISAPPOINTED. It feels like shit. Naaawa ako sa gf niya. Naaawa ako sa sarili ko na pumatol ako sa katulad niya. If only I knew I will never do something I don't want happen to me.  Tangina niyo lahat na mga cheater. Sana mahuli kayo, kung ayaw niyo umamin. Di ko alam pano kayo nakakatulog sa gabi. Kingina di ko kayo, kaya sikmurain. 


P.S clean po lahat ng socials niya fb and ig. Wala ko nakita talaga consistent na babae sa socials, or even nakatag. 

I WILL NOT DATE AGAIN UNTIL MY GRADUATION. FINAL NA YAN. LAST NA YAN.

1iyohuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1iyohuk/confusing_talking_stage23m24f_or_whatever_this/,"Confusing ""talking stage""(23M,24F) or whatever this was, left me feeling a bit confused and pathetic","I (23M) met S (24F) in my master’s program, and she was the one who approached me first. At the time, she had recently gone through a breakup, though she never indicated that she wasn’t open to something new. Our dynamic quickly became playful and close—lots of teasing, deep conversations, and what felt like mutual interest. She often made suggestive jokes, complimented my looks, and we had long late-night chats over texts.

Her behavior also became increasingly hot and cold. One day, she’d go out of her way to start conversations with me, acting friendly and interested. The next, she’d seem distant and reserved, barely acknowledging me. There were moments when it felt like she was still trying to be close to me, but then others where she seemed to be actively pulling away. I couldn’t get a read on what she actually wanted, and it was messing with my head.

One complication in this whole situation was J (30M), another guy in our program, who never seemed to like me. According to S, J had said he liked almost everyone in the program except for me. I barely interacted with him, so I never really knew what his issue was, but it was clear he wasn’t a fan of me, but i noticed that he would keep making subtle digs at me. It was also clear that he was also flirting with S at the same time.

Then, one night at a bar with friends, S sat on J’s lap, which threw me off but since my intentions were casual it did not bother me a lot but still kinda annoyed me given how he acted towards me. It felt out of place, considering how she acted around me, but I didn’t dwell on it too much so i just thoght id take the L and not take it personally . Shortly after that night, she sent me a text that felt like a rejection *""I’m a bit too friendly to people sometimes in ways that I don't mean.”*

I took it at face value and assumed that she was no longer interested and decided to persue something with J , so I started treating her purely as a platonic friend. I figured I had misread the situation and that maybe her flirty behavior had just been part of her personality rather than any real interest in me. I backed off and moved on mentally, treating our interactions as purely friendly and started to see her more like a close friend.

Not long after, though, we had a phone call where she talked about how J made a move on her that night which kind of left her feeling disturbed and that she had taken space from him. In the same phone call she randomly told me that she had thought about sleeping with me at one point, that she had a thing for shorter guys {i am below average height} and of {insert my ethnicity, not going to specify but the men are widely seen as very unnattractive},

This completely contradicted what I thought had been a rejection and left me confused. Why say that if she wasn’t interested? I had already started shifting my mindset away from her in a romantic sense, so I just let the comment go, but in hindsight, it feels like it was intentionally meant to mess with my perception of where we stood. For context we were also talking about my insecurities regarding dating and why J seemd to dislike me so I thought she said this to make me feel better or something as a friend at this point.

Later, we had a text conversation where she clarified that her message hadn’t actually been a rejection. Instead, she claimed she had sent it because she worried that she had come off as too flirty with J and wanted to set boundaries because of that, not because she wasn’t interested in me. This completely upended how I had interpreted the situation. For weeks, I had assumed that she was making it clear that she didn’t see me that way anymore, but now she was suddenly telling me that wasn’t the case. It felt like my instincts had been correct all along, and that there had been something between us, but now there was all this unnecessary confusion.

Shortly after that, we had another phone call where she told me she was “keeping the door closed” between us because she was stressed about people in our program gossiping. This time, I started to get frustrated because it seemed like she was avoiding giving me a real answer. If she was interested but worried about gossip, why not just address it head-on? If she wasn’t interested, why not just say that instead of making it about external circumstances? After this conversation, she became less receptive to me, but she still engaged just enough to keep me uncertain. If she truly wanted to shut things down, she could have just stopped interacting altogether, but she didn’t. She still made an effort to engage with me at times, and while it wasn’t as intense as before, it was still enough to make me question things.

By the end of that month, I had enough of the mixed signals and decided to ghost her to get some clarity as I was starting to have a lot on my plate with uni and work. I figured that if she was really interested, she would reach out but she didnt adress it. But when I was in class with, she continued staring at me in class, occasionally initiating conversations, and going out of her way to intereact with me. If she had truly wanted to close things off, why was she still so fixated on me? It felt like she was trying to keep me in her orbit without actually wanting to be with me.

After about a month of no contact, she randomly reached out :

*""Basically I know we don't really talk anymore (and I completely respect any decision you make in that regard), but I enjoyed discussing stuff with you and there's no bad blood or whatever so I thought I could just say hi and yap. But I don't actually have anything to say so don't worry about that lmao.""*

This message came more than a week before we actually met up for coffee which i proposed as a way to explain to her why i became distiant to her as I felt a little bad for doing so. I also allowed myslef to become a bit hopeful during this period going back to interacting with her in the same way which in hingsight i should have not done.

When we finally met for coffee, she admitted that there had been another guy this entire time. She refused to tell me exactly who he was but implied it was “a bit obvious” and that I had unknowingly interrupted them in group settings. This stood out to me because I had already suspected that someone else might have been in the picture, but I had no idea how long he had been there. I also realized that if she didn’t want to tell me who he was, she probably knew that it would make things even messier. If it was “obvious,” then why not just be upfront about it? Instead, she had spent all this time keeping that information from me while still keeping me close enough to not fully cut me off. She acknowledged flirting with me but she said she was just flirting with many guys in our program to see what it would be like as she had just gotten out of a relationship.

This whole meeting I reacted emotionally but tried my best to keep my cool, becouse i had been thinking about this a lot for the past months but it was seemingly no big deal to her. She said she mainly liked how close we got and vauled out friendship and some of the things I saw as flirting, like the long phone calls was stuff she did with all her friends with no more alterior intentions.

She also told me that I had always been respectful and even said that I could have yelled at her, but I never did. That part stood out to me because it felt like she was trying to relieve some guilt—like she was acknowledging that she hadn’t handled things well but was also subtly positioning herself as the one who had more control over the situation. I also coulnt shake the feeling that I was just a fallback option while she was chasing this other guy this entire time, when I called her out on this she simply said ""she didnt see it that way""

I also wonder if my inexperience with relationships made me an easier target for mixed signals. More than anything, I just want to make sure I never get into a situation like this again becouse i feel a bit pathetic for putting so much mental weight on something that wasnt even a blip on her radar. I have been loosing sleep and overthinking about this as this situation has brought about a lot of my insecurities and I was almost sure she was intrested but as it turns out it was no big deal for her.",3,1740579385.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

  Going to jaco tomorrow and I know a lot of people have been shitting on it but that’s okay. We’re very excited to be hanging with friends and we will be doing things outside of it. (Arenal and Manuel Antonio)
Any coffee/food recommendations from the people who know and love jaco? 
And fun little things to do around jaco?
Thanks 😊

I'm looking for someone to hang out with over a good cup of coffee. No expectations, just two people chatting, laughing, and maybe making new friends. If you like cozy cafes and need a distraction from your responsibilities, let's meet up. You can even recommend your favorite coffee spot (or I can recommend mine)!

A little bit about myself: I'm a university student, average height with an athletic build. My hobbies include hiking, reading, and photography. I love all animals and have a cat (yes I can send pics).

If you're interested in unwinding with me for a little bit, feel free to reach out and let’s make it happen!",1,1740579345.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Week 2 SW: 192.8 lbs
Week 2 CW: 189.8 lbs
Total lost week 2: 3 lbs
Height: 5'6""

Much like week 1 I had zero negative side effects even while upping the Naltrexone. My focus continues to be on protein and six out of seven days I hit 120g or more of protein. I am not an expert, but focusing on protein naturally brings down carbs and fat intake. I am not a huge meat eater, so admittedly I'm relying on protein powder, yogurt, cottage cheese, and other meat-free options. It's not been an issue though. Fairlife Milk in my coffee alone is 15g of protein or so.

Weigh your food! Weighing everything has really opened my eyes about portion sizes and how wrong I've been up to this point. 

I'm walking on my treadmill everyday, and I've started some body weight workouts I found on YouTube.

Average stats for the week: 1,292 calories per day, 24% carbs, 50% protein, 26% fat

I didn't realize my calories were so low for the week until just now, but I think it is because I did a lot of salads for lunch this week. That was all that sounded good to me! ",3,1740579301.0,HersWeightloss,4,1.0,False
