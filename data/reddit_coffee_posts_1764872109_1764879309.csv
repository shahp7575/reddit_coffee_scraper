1peagwn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1peagwn,Which white paint with this color carpet? Greek Villa?,"We’re moving into a house soon and I don’t like the current paint color in the living room. It seems too dark/tan, especially in person. I have colors in mind based off of research: SW Greek Villa, BM Swiss Coffee, Behr Blank Canvas, or BM White Dove. Greek Villa seems to be winning so far. 
- There is plenty of natural lighting that hits the room. 
- That is not our furniture. Our furniture/accessories will be a lot of blacks, grays, whites, and possible greens.  
- My husband and I tend to decorate stuff in black and white and don’t do a lot of colors. 
What should I have in mind about the color of the carpet? Does the carpet mean I should opt for a brighter white like Greek villa? 

Thank you in advance for your help.

1peagqh,https://i.redd.it/ylj91unxv85g1.jpeg,Toro / Raptor Primals X 🎩🌙,"🎩🌙 Toro Faithen — The Scar Night Detective of Zarmenieros

Full Name: Toro Faithen
Age: 19
Birthday: December 27, 2006
Race: Human / American
Alignment: Good
Role: The Scar Night Detective of Zarmenieros / Member of the Scarlem Crew
Residence: Harthdow City (Human World) → Zarmenieros City (Apex World)

😄 Personality:

Toro is a nice, polite, and focused individual who’s always prepared to take down any villain he encounters. He’s an excellent cook, extremely concentrated in battle, and gifted with the ability to detect lies instantly. He uses his hat as both a weapon and an investigative tool, and he’s highly skilled in combat thanks to intense training.
He has a great IQ, never lets villains escape, and never misjudges anyone’s strength — he believes everyone is strong in their own way. He loves traveling across the Apex World, is often shocked by villain bounty amounts, and carries a truly good heart beneath his calm detective exterior.

🍚 Food & Drinks He Enjoys:

Water, coffee, cake pops, apples, bananas, cinnamon muffins, rice, chicken curry, bacon, mashed potatoes, corn, shish kebabs, yellow squash and zucchini, spaghetti, and crab fried rice.

🎩 Powers & Abilities:

Ultimate Residence: (Special Move)
Toro throws his hat into the sky, unleashing an unstoppable slashing attack that’s impossible to dodge. It cuts through regeneration, overpowers abilities and powers, and can cancel universal-level abilities. The attack releases enormous slashes that devastate the opponent’s movements, body parts, and defenses with pinpoint accuracy.

Instant Cut: (Special Move)
Toro moves at extreme speed and slices the opponent instantly with his hat. This technique can decapitate without resistance, break through regeneration, cut steel and stone, destroy special moves, and tear through psychic abilities with ease.

Revelence Structure: (Special Move)
He reads an opponent’s aura, learns their moves, remembers them perfectly, and dodges even the “impossible-to-dodge” attacks. With this foresight, nothing truly lands on him.

Secret Blade Slash:
Toro’s hat transforms into steel. He throws it to unleash a devastating slash capable of breaking through strong defenses, cutting into an enemy’s body structure, and causing severe bleeding that limits their movement.

Hat Scissors Swift:
He unleashes a barrage of a million rapid slashes that travel in every direction. This attack destroys any move it touches and cannot be stopped due to its overwhelming force.

Teleportation Attacks:
Toro teleports instantly, striking repeatedly and causing his opponent to flinch with every hit. These attacks can exhaust the enemy and slow them down while Toro dodges and counters effortlessly.

Hat Slash Cancel:
He throws his hat to cancel an opponent’s abilities and powers entirely. This cancelation attack is faster than teleportation — even faster than time itself.

Boxing Techniques:
Toro is trained in advanced boxing using both fists and legs. He speeds up when hit, dodges while countering, destabilizes opponents, and uses kicks to pin enemies to the ground.

🤝 Relationships

Argonie — Best Friend:
Toro sees Argonie as a great leader and mentor who helped train him. He respects Argonie’s soft spot for others and admires the way he motivates him to grow stronger.

Artonio — Best Friend:
Toro views Artonio as a skilled weapon seller who doesn’t care about good or evil. This makes Toro cautious around him, but he still treats Artonio like a close friend.

Jace — Ok Friendship:
Toro doesn’t see Jace as a threat but often stops him from harming innocent people. He finds Jace chaotic and funny — even if he tries not to laugh. Their friendship is strong and balanced.

Sabiar — Enemy:
Toro sees Sabiar as a villain who corrupts others with fear and pain. He constantly tries to hunt Sabiar down, but Sabiar always escapes. They fight often, talk sometimes, but remain enemies.

Riniss — Enemy:
Toro views Riniss as a powerful curse spirit who lacks all emotion and sympathy. He believes Riniss will never stop hurting others until fate finally catches up with him.

🌌 Overview Summary:

Toro Faithen is known as The Scar Night Detective of Zarmenieros, a respected member of the Scarlem Crew and one of the most dedicated crime-solvers in the Raptor Primals X universe. He never fails a case, never forgives villains for harming others, and uses his razor-sharp hat techniques to bring justice to the Apex World.
Villains often underestimate him because he doesn’t carry typical weapons — but that mistake usually ends with them shredded by his spinning, slashing signature hat techniques.
Toro is the guardian detective who protects Zarmenieros City with unwavering determination, ensuring no innocent person gets hurt under his watch.

1peafjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/1peafjs/how_i_started_my_own_tax_firm_cpa_approaching_3rd/,"How I started my own tax firm (CPA), approaching 3rd busy season","I started my own tax firm a couple years ago and have been meaning to share some of my experience for a long time.

I promised myself I would write this quickly and get it over with. So I am not writing this very carefully. Excuse any errors, omissions, or confusing writing.

If people have questions I will try to respond occasionally but will probably be bad about it.



Viability:

* Most businesses end up going out of business and that is always very much a possibility. My goal in year one was just to break even, not even cover my living expenses.
* The first year may be slow in terms of client work but you will be building a website, setting up various software programs, dealing with legal paperwork, IRS registration, forms, etc.
* In year one my overall earnings were probably about 35% of what I would have earned as an employee. In year two, my earnings overall were probably about 70% of what I would have earned as an employee.
* Knowing I had savings and could always go back to working was a big aid to me mentally.
* After two years, I feel more secure than I did working and am less stressed. Part of this is because I am conservative in terms of how much work I take on.



My experience and qualifications when I started my firm:

* 5 years of experience in tax preparation at a single quality firm
* CPA credential
* I was manager level and had never signed a return.
* Because I did a mid-career change, I had about 10 years total professional work experience when I started my firm.



Current client mix:

* Maybe \~80% individual returns; \~10% business entities; \~10% trusts.
* The individual returns i do are definitely on the more complex end with rentals, equity compensation, and schedule c's.
* I definitely recommend focusing on what you are good at even if it means saying no. I have found it helpful if clients are not a good fit for me to try and find referral resources as it feels better to refer than to say no.



Business Location:

* I work from home in a high income area. 



Marketing: Yelp mostly

* I started my firm with no clients. I have been adding about \~50 clients a year
* In the beginning I did ask a few friends that I had helped with tax stuff to leave a review for me on Yelp.
* In the beginning almost all my clients found me via Yelp. I do have more referrals now from old colleagues, financial advisors, and current clients.
* I did pay for a basic level of yelp marketing the first couple years (talk to a rep and you can get a good deal).
* I did not reach out to any of the clients from my previous firm but a couple of them found me on LinkedIn. I was manager level so all the clients I had been working with were the “partner’s” clients and not “mine”.
* It can be smart to connect with clients via LinkedIn so that they can find you if you ever leave your firm.
* I am based in a high income area and being in a high income area one-hundred percent helped me even though I work from home. Many clients found me based on geographic proximity shown on Yelp.
* For Yelp, I used a USPS box as my address since I work from home.
* For me starting from scratch has been a bit of a blessing as it give me a clean slate to work from, and taught me what works and what doesn’t.
* I might advise trying to start without buying a book of business and then buying a book of business after a year if you are not happy with your growth rate. That gives you some time to learn the ropes of building a business before jumping into the deep end. It also helps you avoid potential lemons or overpaying for something you don't need.
* Growth has been about as fast as I would want. I stopped accepting clients for my third busy season in November; I stopped accepting new clients for my second busy season in January.
* I had a beard partly to make myself look more mature in client meetings (I look young without a beard). I am no longer keeping the beard, but I do think it helped in the beginning. Wearing glasses probably would help too but I did not do that.
* Clients will very much judge you based on how knowledgeable you are during the initial prospective client meeting (see below)
* When your business is brand new clients will be more skeptical then after a year or two. There is not much you can do about that other than wait for time to pass.



Client emails:

* I handle all emails with clients.
* I move client emails to a shared inbox folder to so that my employee has access to read
* I maintain inbox zero pretty well.
* I have an incoming folder for notifications about things like document uploads and document signatures. I have inbox rules set up so that these types of notification emails go to that inbox automatically. Both my employee and I have access to that folder to manage incoming items



Client meetings: Acuity and Zoom

* I use a combination of Acuity and Zoom so that clients can self-schedule meetings on my website.
* Acuity has the best looking website scheduler in my opinion. It integrates well with Zoom which is why I chose Zoom.
* At this point, the phone number on my website goes to a voicemail. If a prospective new client leaves a message, I text rather than call asking them to schedule a meeting on my website.
* If a prospective new client emails me, I respond asking them to schedule a meeting on my website. I mostly have a template that I copy and paste to respond.
* If a prospective client reaches out to me by Yelp, I respond in Yelp asking them to schedule a meeting on my website. I mostly have a template that I copy and paste to respond.
* I will take phone calls from existing clients who get my direct my number.
* Existing clients have their own meeting type on my website that they can schedule. This is especially helpful if they want to schedule a meeting to review a return.
* Scheduling meetings without a scheduling tools really sucks and I avoid it as much as possible.



Prospective client meeting:

* Prospective clients self-schedule the prospective client meeting (see above regarding Zoom and Acuity)
* In the beginning, I was a little self-conscience about not having a brick and mortar and did meet a couple prospective clients in person at coffee shops. Now I never do that for the first meeting and rarely at all.
* In the beginning new client meetings were free and I definitely gave free advice. I now charge $60 for a 30-minute meeting. The meeting usually goes more than 30 minutes.
* During the initial meeting I start by asking them to introduce themselves and provide a little background on their tax situation. I will eventually ask about: equity compensation, if they have schedule K-1’s, rental properties, crypto-currency trading, foreign bank or financial accounts, bookkeeping software, separate bank accounts for businesses, employees, retirement plans, health insurance if through a business, itemized deductions, etc. The meeting is thorough.
* During the initial client meeting I will almost always provide a fee estimate without looking at the return (see pricing below).
* After the client meeting I email the client a fairly thorough summary of the meeting mostly focused on their tax situation (written by me, not AI). If they want to move forward, they respond to that email to let me know. I then also have a good summary for myself when I have forgotten the conversation entirely.

 

Tax software: Started with Lacerte, switched to CCH Axcess

* Lacerte was great in a lot of ways but not being cloud-native was the nail in the coffin for me. You can put Lacerte on a virtual desktop, which I did using AceCloud Pro once I added an employee. Still, I decided CCH Axcess would be the better fit for me in the long-term and bit the bullet of migrating \~100 clients.
* Someday I might consider a fully “virtual desktop” solution where all my software (browser, email, files, tax software, etc.) is hosted in a virtual environment on my “own” servers. However, not sure if that makes sense or not.
* One mistake I made was purchasing Lacerte without talking to a sales rep. I would have gotten a bigger discount if I had. CCH gave me a good deal for my first year.
* The only thing I really miss about Lacerte is the cover letter which nicely summarized state and federal estimated tax payments into one table rather than two tables. The biggest issue I had with Lacerte was for some trust return calculations and the fact that most of my more complex clients are coming from firms that use CCH. I also found it more difficult to review K-1's reported on 1040's in Lacerte (CCH has supplemental schedules in the tax return that I like).
* Before starting my business, I trialed Drake with a few friend and family returns. I found Drake very deficient compared to both Lacerte and Axcess.
* Generally I review off the ""client copy"" version of the return so that I know it has everything I want and that layout makes sense.

 

Automated tax form data entry: Gruntworx

* I use Gruntworx for the initial automated tax form data entry.
* I believe SurePrep has something similar but slightly more expensive at \~$45/client. I did not know of SurePrep's product when I started with GruntWorx, not sure which I would choose now.

 

Legal entity: started as sole proprietor, switched to S-Corp

* If I had the option of doing an LLC, I would recommend doing that from the beginning, however, my state’s CPA licensing board does not allow me to practice as an LLC.
* Looking back, I probably would set up the S-Corp from the beginning mainly to prevent having to change EIN’s, registration with IRS, and such.
* I used LawInc to set up my entity and it was a smooth process although fairly barebones.
* If I ever add partners, I believe I will be able to use wages, bonuses, commissions, and such to allocate income in reasonably flexible manners. That said, the restrictions on allocating income is definitely a major downside to S-Corps and my choice of entity might have been different if I had a partner currently.

 

Internal file storage: currently using SharePoint with automated back-ups via a third-party.

* If I was starting over, I would probably try CCH Engagement or SmartVault for workpaper storage. Getting file storage working well with SharePoint has been a little more complicated, glitchy, and expensive than I thought it would be.
* I am usually pretty willing to DIY, but did end up hiring a 3^(rd) party to do secure back-ups of my SharePoint files.
* If you are using SharePoint or OneDrive, I like Directory Opus because it allows you to expand folders in a branching view, similar to what I understand Apple users have. It also allows you to color code files green or other colors which is good for having things reviewed.

 

Client file portal: ShareFile

* I use ShareFile. Note sure if it is any better than SafeSend or SmartVault. But those are probably the main three I know of and would look at.

 

Annual Questionnaire / engagement letter:

* I am a lunatic and write my own annual questionnaire using Cognito Forms. It is more of an idiosyncratic rabbit hole than I would like to get into here. But I do like Cognito Forms if you want a form builder.
* I also use Cognito Forms for my engagement letter and onboarding forms and it is probably more straight forward for that purpose since it is shorter and does not involve saving.

 

Pricing: I use almost only estimated-fee prices, not hourly

* Without looking at a tax return, I will generally quote an estimated fee during my first introductory client meetings. My introductory calls are very thorough (see above)
* I do think it helps to have a few go-to tiers in mind, I use the following estimate ranges quite a bit: $1,000 - $1,300;  $1,400 - $1,700; $2,000 - $2,500.
* I have had a few complaints on price, but not many. I have been told I need to charge more and have been increasing prices gradually as my business has become more established.
* I do have an hourly price in my engagement letter at $200 / hour but I almost never use it and even my engagement letter says that it only applies if we have not provided an estimated fee for the specific project. I do not have a different hourly rate for my employee than myself as it did not seem worth it to differentiate given how little we use it.
* I send out fee estimates for all clients in \~December for the upcoming tax season using a mail merge tool
* Revenue in year 2 was roughly \~$1.5K to \~$2.0K per tax client, which includes some delinquent returns and consulting work. Median return pricing is probably \~$1K - \~$1.5K in a high cost area.
* I charge when I send the tax return. I do not charge separately for 15-30 minute questions. I do not do any subscription pricing.

 

Employees:

* I hired someone who was comfortable with a flexible schedule for my first employee.
* I pay hourly including overtime during tax season and aim to keep total hours per week at 55 or less.
* Outside of tax season I have been averaging 16 hours for my employee mostly.",1,1764879112.0,Accounting,0,1.0,False

Over the past few days I’ve been working on a tiny project for myself — basically a very minimal focus timer because I felt overwhelmed by the clutter in most apps.

The interesting part wasn’t the tool itself but what I learned while building it:

* Keeping things visually simple makes me *want* to focus more
* Ambient sound actually helped me stay consistent
* A clean “start focus” workflow reduced procrastination
* OLED/dark themes genuinely felt easier on the eyes during long sessions
* Building a tool for yourself reveals what *actually* matters and what doesn’t

If anyone has built their own productivity systems or tools (even tiny ones), I’d love to hear what worked for you.

The middle of November I had burning when I peed, felt like I was peeing razors, urgency with little actual urine, and chills. Leukocytes were 75+ and I have UPJ of the right ureter so to protect my kidney, I always get a rocephin shot followed by oral antibiotics. The provider thought possibly kidney stones but since there was no blood and no stone like pain, it probably wasn’t. I was on Keflex 10 days and 2 days after finishing the dose, symptoms came back. Again, tested for trace Leukocytes so they gave another shot and macrobid. Found out yesterday the first culture was negative and the found out today the second also came back negative.

I really and truly do not understand how they are negative and I am symptomatic. Within 2 hours of the shot, the burning stops so I have a hard time believing it is not a UTI.

Am I being sensitive or are they gaslighting me?,"A little back story first I (28F) have been working for this company a little under 2 years but we only have 14 employees at a time so some of us have gotten really close. I’d say my closest “friends” there are N and R and then J is another person that works with us as well and someone who I’ve thought of as a friend from time to time but recently have been butting heads with repeatedly. Another piece of back story I don’t drive. It’s a choice I’ve continued to make even after learning to drive and getting a car. It’s what’s best for my anxiety and no judgement on that part please. Okay to the story now. On Tuesday N and I were scheduled to work at the same time. It’s the week after thanksgiving so it felt a bit like recovering since it was insanely busy for the holiday week but it’s also not since we have someone from the corporate office shadowing us all week. Anyways N and I usually go together if we’re scheduled at the same time. She’ll pick me up as we live 3 blocks from each other and hang out before we have to go in. We’ve hung out outside of work multiple times (movies, girl dinner dates, etc.) like I said I thought we were friends. So like normal she agreed to give me a ride. Now I understand I’m the burden in this so usually I’ll buy coffee or offer gas money even though we live less than 30 seconds apart. Two hours before I have to be there (3:00pm) J texts me asking if I can come in a half hour early as someone had to leave early. I told him no my partner wasn’t home yet to take over childcare (I have 2 crotch goblins) and I’d already agreed to ride with N and didn’t want to ask her to take me early. Well 30 minutes (4:30pm) before I’m scheduled to clock in N texts me telling me she’ll have to just see me later because J called her in early. This is where the hurt feelings started. I felt like because I explained to J I couldn’t come in early partially because I was riding with N and he went to her after me and asked her to come in, it was hurtful. I felt like N dropping me for 30 minutes of pay was hurtful. Now mind you, I have a car. My partner can always take me to work and anywhere else I need as I plan my schedule around his. N never needed to give me a ride in the first place. We just lived super close, worked the same shifts often and slowly became best friends. So I texted J and asked why he did that. Told him how confused I was by that. As soon as I get to work I clock in and immediately start working. Within minutes of working I’m approached by someone I thought was my best friend (but is also my boss) to have a conversation. This was R. I said no. This conversation was to be had in the office in front of J and the corporate guy. I tried to explain I was still upset and didn’t think it was the appropriate time or place. R continued to question me in front of them and 2 other employees but playing like I needed to explain to her why I was upset in the first place because she had “no idea” what was going on and that I was just “visibly upset.” She followed me into the break room after I stormed off after repeatedly telling her if she didn’t stop, I was going to leave. I just needed a moment. To breathe maybe cry a little. I felt backed into a corner by someone I thought was my closest friend. In the break room she tells me that J was doing what she told him to do. That R was just doing her job as the boss to call someone in and I’m upset for nothing. R threatens that if I leave she’ll write me up and she’ll have to stay to close after opening. I told her I don’t feel bad, if she had left me alone in the first place I never would’ve left. And I left. As I’m leaving she’s still yelling at me so I tell her I won’t come back if she can’t just drop it at least for now. 
Since then I texted her I’ll be there my next scheduled day and that our relationship will strictly be boss to employee. I was hurt. She claimed all of it was her just trying to check on me as my “friend.” That our whole conversation was just a concerned friend checking in and that I took it the wrong way. R doesn’t think anything was done wrong on their end but “she’s sorry I feel that way.” N feels the same way but is more hurt by my decision to put some distance and go back to being just coworkers. I feel like sure in reality not that big a deal. It didn’t even really cause me an inconvenience. BUT I also feel like it showed some true colors and clearly that’s work over friends. Am I being sensitive? Did I mess up by making my coworkers my friends in the first place? Are they gaslighting me? ",1,1764878895.0,AmiInTheWrong,0,1.0,False

Mighty Gun Yanaw:
A million-shot weapon that tears away skin, breaks regenerating shields, and causes brutal, fatal injuries with insane accuracy.

Sniper Fade Slash:
A sniper that fires unstoppable light-speed bullets that never erase, only lose force. The more you strike it, the faster and stronger the next shot becomes.

Knock-Out Gun:

* Rewrite himself as immortal
* Erase characters from existence
* Reset fights
* Rewrite any power, move, or technique

Darly — (Best Friend)
His closest friend. Their bond is deep, loyal, and unbreakable. They fight for each other no matter what.

Juke — (Best Friend)
Trusted with weapon advice. Not as close as Darly, but still part of Jace’s core circle.

Tayona — (Mother)
A loving, strong relationship. She doesn’t know about his villain identity, but Jace deeply loves and protects her.

Derrin — Rival (Respectful)
A powerful villain Jace admires. Intelligent, kingly, and someone Jace dreams to recruit one day.

Darkback — Enemy (Neutral)
An enemy, but one he respects for creativity and powerful color-based abilities.

J Ander — Enemy (Respect)
Sees J as a heroic threat but a worthy rival. Loves joking around with him in battle.

Father — (Unknown)
Thinks his father abandoned him. Doesn’t remember him at all.

📖 Summary Overview:

Jace Gitorie — the infamous Powerful Raptor Gun Shooter of Warking City — is a protagonist who grew into a villain after years of pain, bullying, and feeling powerless. Alongside Darly and Juke, he discovered the ancient King Velociraptor statue, which granted them dark velociraptor hybrid power. Together, the trio formed one of the strongest villain squads in all of Warking City. Jace embraced his new strength, wielding futuristic guns, reality-breaking powers, and unstoppable speed. He became a villain not because he wanted chaos — but because the world pushed him there.

Over the summer there was a crack in the seam of my window, and tiny little flies would congregate on the only light source in my room, the monitor. I squished them and for some reason never cleaned the streaks and residue thoroughly so now I have a dozen stains on the monitor. 

I tried a 

1. Microfiber cloth

2. Then with distilled water 

3. Then with half white vinegar half water solution

4. Then let the vinegar solution sit for 3 minutes (on a coffee filter which I saw recommended online)

5. and finally let the solution sit for 20 minutes

None of this worked at all, not even lessen the streaks. I saw 70% isopropyl alcohol recommended but I'm kind of scared it will hurt the monitor. I know I was dumb to let the stains get caked in.

It is clearly indicated on the invite that coffee orders are on us (we are getting married in a coffee shop!) and light refreshments will be served. 

Due to space and budget, we just can't feasibly give everyone a meal. But it is an evening wedding so I would light some more substantial items. (Though, I'm not sure how to do hot items bc I am not a caterer and we don't have one.) Space is also an issue - as the venue only has a few tables, so a sit down meal isn't feasible.

So, now I'm trying to figure out what these light refreshments should be! 
I am going to do a charcuterie board already; what else? Ideas? 

***Please do not tell me to change the time. We can't do it earlier bc the business is open and the cost was triple per hour; we can't do it later bc we also have a toddler. Also, I already have invitations. But thank you!

1pea7sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcritiques/comments/1pea7sb/my_first_time_working_on_an_original_story_would/,"my first time working on an original story, would love some feedback on the opening","You first realise that you are different when you are seven-years-old at your grandparents' house, and the candles on your birthday cake tell you that your grandmother is going to die soon. 

Your family doesn't hear them, of course. The candles are just candles. Waxy, misshapen from previous use, the kind that leave your fingers feeling tacky; your grandfather recovered them earlier from a rarely-opened kitchen drawer, wrapped loosely in a napkin. 

Now, their flames flicker across the walls like a lightbulb not screwed in tight enough, deforming the florals printed on the wallpaper, more faded and thin with every year that you grow two or three inches taller. The shadows give you the impression that you are sunken, that your breath is warm, that your blood is circulating from your temples. Your family's faces look strange, lit from the bottom. You can see their teeth better than their eyes. You wonder how well they can see yours. 

You don't know how the candles talk. They don't, really. There are no words involved at all, no whispers in the back of your mind. It's just the way they move, how their small orange sparks dip low and rise high, a pattern in the shade they throw. You understand, suddenly. It makes sense. 

Your grandmother, they say, is going to develop a blood clot in her heart; it will travel to her brain, where it will then cause a severe stroke, and though your grandfather will call an ambulance, having recognised the signs, she will—ultimately—die as a result. A clock ticking on and on, until the moment it breaks. There is no changing it, not now. 

You understand this, too. It sticks in your mind as an unshakeable fact. All you can do is memorise the wrinkles on her face and the shade of blue in her eyes, and hug her before you leave tonight. 

""Go on, sweetheart,"" your mother says, smiling as she squeezes your shoulder. Her blonde hair looks brassy in this light, her skin soft enough to sink a finger through. The candles have nothing to say about her. Your mother's heart is, evidently, working just fine. ""Make a wish."" 

Of course. Your wish. Naturally. 

The tips of your fingers itch. Or maybe it's a numbness. Or a tingling. You rub them against the seat of your chair where the edge has been worn down into more a curve, wood smooth like paper. Your grandparents' house has a lot of paper in it; a lot of books, folders, journals, letters. You have not read them all, though you try. You will one day. 

But returning to the matter of your wish. Your grandmother. Time, and how there is progressively less of it. 

She's the type of person who looks kind. Hair neat and reaching down to her chin, grey through and through. Clear eyes. She goes on a walk every day, even in winter. To the church three streets down on Sundays. She wears loose flowy skirts to her ankles and jumpers out of wool. She makes you sandwiches with rye bread every time you visit before school, and lets you help her with her crosswords even though you never know many answers. You think your grandfather loves her very much. You look at her over the table, and feel a sudden rush of vertigo as your heart skips a beat. Clot, brain, stroke—like she's been branded. The candles smell like smoke. 

You want to tell her to stop having doughnuts with her coffee so often; to call her doctor, to go the hospital and demand to be seen. You want to tell her that this soft, beating, fragile possession she's carried around in her chest like a loaf of fresh bread in her gentle hands, this organ that she refills in the mornings and soothes before sleep, for longer than you can at this age imagine—this thing is doomed; the muscle is too weak, the blood is too thick. 

It needs repair. It is slipping through her fingers, and she doesn't even know. 

But she's smiling. Not in a rush. She looks settled—and you can't explain how, but you know, unchangeably, that this path is set. A sudden switch in diet will not fix anything, the doctors will find nothing. This is just one of those things, hidden until the very last moment. An old organ. An old end. Like the months turning, each one coming after the next and absolutely nothing you can do about it. 

So you try to settle, too. 

Your grandmother's hands are very soft, which is something you have always liked about her. This is what you think about as you lean forward in your chair, bringing your face close to the white-frosted cake.

You could still be wrong, you think, even as something primal and knowing in your stomach roils at the very suggestion. It is a possibility. You could be imagining things. Making up things that aren't true. Maybe you're getting sick. Your grandmother could very well live another few long years. That would be nice. 

You close your eyes and blow. Smoke winds itself under your nose, dark and earthy like a spoilt perfume, like a grassy bonfire, like cigarettes; blooms behind your eyes in the holiest headache. Your wish this year, for your seventh birthday, is that your grandmother won't die. You wish it harder than you have ever wished for anything ever before. You wish it until your jaw aches. 

It is dark when you open your eyes. You managed to blow each and every candle out first try. 

You cannot shake the feeling that this was a waste of a wish.

Let me tell you something about being the CEO of a Fortune 500 company: it's basically like being God, except with slightly worse parking and significantly more lawyers. I run what I affectionately call a ""trillion-parameter operation""—not because we have a trillion parameters, but because I enjoy watching my underlings try to figure out if that's a real metric or if I'm just testing their willingness to nod along. Spoiler: I'm always testing their willingness to nod along.

My name is Bradley Winston Hartwell III, and yes, I am exactly as insufferable as that sounds. I've got a corner office that overlooks a smaller corner office that overlooks an even smaller corner office, like some kind of corporate matryoshka doll of diminishing importance. My desk is mahogany. My chair cost more than most cars. My business cards are made from a paper stock so thick they've been classified as a concealed weapon in three states.

It was a Thursday evening—7:47 PM, to be exact, because I remember these things—and I was doing what every visionary leader does after hours: refreshing my inbox while pretending to review quarterly projections. The projections were fine. They were always fine. ""Fine"" is what you call numbers when you've hired enough accountants to make them fine.

That's when I saw it.

Subject line: \*\*""TML: The Missing Accountability Spine Your Model Pretends to Have.""\*\*

Now, I receive approximately four hundred emails per day, and roughly three hundred and ninety-seven of them are vendors trying to sell me things I don't need using words I don't understand. AI this, blockchain that, synergy the other thing. I've developed an immunity to buzzwords. My eyes glaze over faster than a Krispy Kreme donut the moment someone mentions ""paradigm shift.""

But this subject line was different.

It was \*rude\*.

It was implying that my model—MY model, the crown jewel of Hartwell Industries' AI initiative, the thing I personally took credit for during three separate earnings calls—was somehow... lacking. In spine. In \*accountability\* spine, specifically, which wasn't even a term I'd heard before, but I was already offended by it.

I clicked the email out of boredom and spite. These are my two primary motivators. Ask anyone.

The email contained a single link and a single sentence: ""Your AI makes decisions. TML makes those decisions provable. Choose wisely.""

I don't respond well to being told to choose wisely. The last person who told me to choose wisely was my second wife's divorce attorney, and look how that turned out. Spoiler: expensively.

So I clicked the link, ready to fire off a condescending reply about how we at Hartwell Industries don't need some acronym to tell us how to—

Within forty seconds, I was sweating like a man reading his own autopsy report.

\---

The website that loaded was not what I expected. I expected the usual startup garbage: stock photos of diverse people pointing at whiteboards, testimonials from companies I'd never heard of, maybe a ""Schedule Your Demo"" button the size of a billboard. Instead, I got... documentation. Actual, readable documentation. The kind of documentation that suggests someone cared more about explaining their work than selling it.

This was my first red flag.

I scrolled down and encountered something called the ""Three Decision States.""

\*\*+1: Affirmation.\*\* Proceed with confidence when ethical values align.

\*\*0: Sacred Zero.\*\* Pause for reflection when moral complexity is detected.

\*\*-1: Moral Resistance.\*\* Object when significant ethical conflicts arise.

I stared at my screen. I read it again. Then I read it a third time, because I was convinced I was having a stroke.

A \*third\* state? Between yes and no? That wasn't how computers worked. That wasn't how \*anything\* worked. You either approve the acquisition or you don't. You either greenlight the product launch or you delay it until legal stops hyperventilating. There is no sacred middle ground in capitalism. The middle ground is for people who don't have quarterly targets.

But this ""Sacred Zero"" thing—this deliberate pause, this moment of computational hesitation—it was described not as a bug but as a feature. The AI was \*supposed\* to stop and say, ""Hold on, this is complicated, and I think a human should weigh in.""

My AI had never done that. My AI had the ethical consideration of a vending machine. You put in a request, something fell out, and if it happened to crush your foot, that was technically your problem for standing too close.

I kept reading.

""Sacred Pause: The moment between question and answer where wisdom begins.""

I laughed out loud. Wisdom! In AI! The AI my company deployed last quarter had confidently recommended firing our entire marketing department and replacing them with ""targeted vibrational frequency campaigns."" We did not do this, obviously, but only because someone in HR asked what a vibrational frequency campaign was, and no one could explain it without sounding like they'd joined a cult.

Then I hit the section on Moral Trace Logs.

This is where the sweating began in earnest.

Moral Trace Logs. Every decision the AI makes, logged. Every ethical consideration, recorded. Every moment where the system chose +1, 0, or -1, timestamped and stored with cryptographic immutability. The framework didn't just make decisions—it created an \*evidence trail\*. A paper trail, but worse, because paper can be shredded, and this couldn't.

My throat went dry.

I kept scrolling.

""No Log = No Action.""

The words stared back at me like a judge reading a sentencing statement. No log, no action. If the AI couldn't prove it had gone through proper ethical evaluation, it couldn't act. Period. Every decision required immutable proof that it had been made correctly. Every. Single. One.

I thought about all the decisions my AI had made without any logs whatsoever. I thought about the customer data we'd ""aggregated."" I thought about the ""personalization algorithms"" that were really just very sophisticated guessing engines with the moral compass of a Magic 8-Ball. I thought about what would happen if auditors could see everything.

Then I thought about what would happen if \*shareholders\* could see everything.

Then I poured myself a drink.

Then I poured myself another drink.

Then I kept reading, because apparently I hate myself.

""No Spy. No Weapon.""

Universal prohibitions. Hardcoded into the framework. You couldn't use TML for mass surveillance. You couldn't use it for weapons development. You couldn't use it for authoritarian control or discriminatory systems or anything that a reasonable person would describe as ""evil"" if they squinted hard enough.

This was insane. This was \*limiting\*. Half our government contracts were in a gray area that could generously be described as ""surveil-adjacent."" How were we supposed to compete if we couldn't do the questionable things our competitors were definitely also doing?

But it got worse.

Performance guarantees. Sacred Zero evaluation: ≤2ms at the 99th percentile. Full log completion: ≤500ms, including blockchain anchor. They'd actually done the engineering. This wasn't some academic framework that would crumble under real-world load. Someone had built this to \*work\*.

Merkle-batched anchoring. Proofs stored on public blockchains. Organizational claims independently verifiable. I didn't know what half these words meant, but I knew what ""independently verifiable"" meant, and it meant that our quarterly reports would need to start containing things like ""facts"" and ""accuracy.""

My hand was shaking. I put down my glass.

Then I reached the section on privacy and trade secrets, and for one brief, beautiful moment, I thought I'd found a loophole. GDPR-compliant erasure! Pseudonymization before hashing! Something called ERK—Ephemeral Key Rotation—where temporary keys vanished after verification!

But no. These weren't loopholes. These were \*features\*. The framework had been designed to protect legitimate privacy concerns while still maintaining accountability. It threaded the needle between transparency and confidentiality with the precision of someone who had thought about this problem for a very long time.

I hate people who think about problems for a very long time. They make the rest of us look bad.

\---

At some point during my escalating panic, I did what any rational person would do: I googled the creator.

Lev Goukassian.

The name sounded Eastern European, or possibly like a type of cheese I'd pretended to enjoy at a charity gala. I clicked through to his profile expecting the usual tech bro narrative—Stanford dropout, garage startup, hoodie-based wardrobe, disruption this, disruption that.

Instead, I found something that made me sit back in my very expensive chair and stare at my ceiling.

Lev Goukassian had built this entire framework while dying.

Stage 4 cancer. Terminal diagnosis. And instead of doing what normal people do when facing their own mortality—writing memoirs, traveling to exotic locations, making dramatic speeches to estranged family members—this man had decided to create a comprehensive ethical framework for artificial intelligence. He'd looked at the existential void and said, ""Yes, but have you considered accountability mechanisms?""

I scrolled through his documentation. I read about his philosophy. I found a quote that hit me like a freight train:

""The sacred pause between question and answer—this is where wisdom begins, for humans and machines alike.""

He'd written that. While dying. While building a system more comprehensive than anything my R&D department had produced in five years with unlimited budgets and unlimited excuses.

And then—and this is the part where I questioned my entire career—I found out about Vinci.

Vinci the miniature Schnauzer.

According to everything I could find, this man had done his most important work with a small dog sitting next to him. A dog named after Leonardo da Vinci. A dog that, in that moment, I was forced to admit was probably more qualified than half my executive team, because at least the dog had been present for the creation of something genuinely meaningful.

I looked at the framed photos on my desk. My yacht. My third house. My awards for ""Excellence in Corporate Leadership,"" which is a phrase that means absolutely nothing.

I looked back at my screen.

A dying man with a Schnauzer had just outthought every AI lab on the planet.

\---

I called the emergency board meeting for 9 PM. This was unusual. Board meetings are typically scheduled weeks in advance, involve catering decisions that cost more than some weddings, and require at least three preliminary meetings to decide what would be discussed in the actual meeting. An emergency board meeting at 9 PM on a Thursday suggested either that I was having a mental breakdown or that something genuinely important had happened.

Both were technically true.

The board members filed in with expressions ranging from ""concerned"" to ""annoyed"" to ""I was at my mistress's apartment and this had better be important."" Richard Vanderberg was still wearing golf clothes. Miriam Chen had clearly been in the middle of a spa treatment and still had what appeared to be seaweed on her neck. Gerald Thompson arrived six minutes late because Gerald Thompson has never arrived on time for anything in his life, including his own colonoscopy.

I stood at the head of the table. I had prepared a presentation. The presentation consisted entirely of screenshots from the TML documentation and my own handwritten notes, which had devolved into increasingly frantic scribbling by the end.

""Ladies and gentlemen,"" I began, ""we have a problem.""

""Is it the Chinese?"" Richard asked immediately. Richard asks if everything is the Chinese. Supply chain issues? Chinese. Server outages? Chinese. His golf handicap? Somehow, also Chinese.

""It's not the Chinese, Richard.""

""Then what is it?"" Miriam wiped seaweed from her neck with the dignity of a woman who had practiced maintaining composure in far worse situations.

I pulled up the first slide. The TML logo. The three decision states. The words ""Sacred Zero"" in large, unforgiving font.

""This,"" I said, ""is going to destroy us.""

There was a pause.

""Is that a mindfulness app?"" Gerald asked.

I stared at him. I stared at him for long enough that the silence became uncomfortable.

""Gerald,"" I said slowly, ""this is an ethical accountability framework for artificial intelligence. It creates immutable logs of every decision. It makes every AI action auditable, traceable, and—most importantly—contestable in a court of law.""

""Court-admissible evidence?"" Our legal counsel, Patricia Whitmore, sat up so fast she nearly spilled her mineral water. ""From an AI?""

""From \*our\* AI,"" I clarified. ""Hypothetically. If we were forced to implement this. Which we might be. Because this thing is spreading.""

I pulled up the next slide. Technical specifications. Dual-lane latency. Merkle-batched anchoring. Blockchain proof storage.

""Someone explain to me what any of this means,"" Richard demanded.

""It means,"" I said, ""that if TML becomes an industry standard, we can no longer hide behind 'proprietary architecture' when our AI does something questionable. We can no longer claim the model made decisions we didn't understand. We can no longer shrug and say 'algorithms are complicated' when regulators come knocking. Every decision will have a receipt.""

The room went very, very quiet.

""Does this apply to financial decisions?"" the CFO asked. His name was Martin. Martin was the kind of CFO who knew where every body was buried because he'd helped dig most of the graves. His voice had taken on a quality I'd never heard before. Fear.

""Every decision,"" I repeated.

Martin's face went the color of old oatmeal. I knew, in that moment, that he was thinking about The Numbers We Don't Talk About. Every company has Numbers We Don't Talk About. They're the numbers that make quarterly reports possible. They're the numbers that exist in a quantum state of being technically legal until someone looks at them too closely.

""If auditors can see everything,"" Martin said slowly, ""then—""

""Shareholders can see everything,"" I finished.

Patricia Whitmore stood up so fast her chair rolled backward and hit the wall. ""If this becomes mandatory,"" she said, her voice rising with each word, ""our entire quarterly bluff strategy is DEAD. Dead! Deceased! Buried in an unmarked grave next to our liability projections!""

""Calm down, Patricia—""

""I WILL NOT CALM DOWN, BRADLEY."" Patricia only used my first name when she was genuinely alarmed. ""Do you understand what 'court-admissible evidence' means? It means that every single time your precious AI makes a recommendation, there's a RECORD. A permanent, immutable, blockchain-verified RECORD. Do you know how many of our decisions would look in court? DO YOU?""

""Patricia, please—""

""WE CALLED IT 'AGGRESSIVE CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT.' THE RECORD WOULD SAY 'PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION ENGINE.'""

I let her finish. Sometimes you just have to let people process.

When the screaming subsided, our CTO, Daniel Park, raised his hand. Daniel was the youngest person in the room by a significant margin, which meant he still believed problems could be solved through cleverness rather than bribery.

""I have a suggestion,"" he said.

""Go ahead, Daniel.""

""What if we just... rename TML and pretend we invented it?""

The room considered this. I could see the appeal. Corporate history is littered with innovations that were ""inspired by"" other innovations, which is a polite way of saying ""stolen with better branding.""

""We could call it the Hartwell Accountability Protocol,"" Daniel continued, warming to his idea. ""HAP. It's friendlier. Less threatening. We launch it as our own initiative, get ahead of the regulatory curve, and position ourselves as industry leaders in ethical AI.""

For a brief, shining moment, I felt hope.

Then Patricia laughed. It was not a happy laugh.

""Daniel,"" she said, in the tone of a woman explaining something to a particularly slow child, ""Lev Goukassian notarized everything. Timestamped everything. Cryptographically anchored his entire body of work. He created something called a 'Voluntary Succession Declaration' that eliminates the—"" she checked her notes, ""—'Bus Factor.' No single entity can ever own TML. No single person can ever control it. The man was dying of cancer and still found time to ensure that vultures like us couldn't pick his corpse clean.""

""But—""

""He out-lawyered us from beyond the grave, Daniel. While dying. With a Schnauzer.""

The room fell silent again.

Miriam, who had remained uncharacteristically quiet, finally spoke. ""So our options are...?""

""Implement TML and become accountable for everything we do,"" I said, ""or don't implement TML and watch our competitors become trustworthy while we remain... us.""

""Could we pivot to a different industry?"" Richard suggested. ""Something less complicated. Something without AI. Scented candles, perhaps.""

I wish I could tell you he was joking. Richard had made his fortune in textiles before transitioning to tech investment. In his heart, he longed for a simpler time when products were physical objects you could drop on your foot.

""We're not pivoting to scented candles, Richard.""

""Artisanal scented candles. The margins are excellent—""

""Richard.""

""Fine.""

\---

The meeting devolved, as all emergency meetings eventually do, into a series of smaller arguments that accomplished nothing. Legal blamed Engineering. Engineering blamed Product. Product blamed Marketing. Marketing blamed the concept of accountability itself, which they described as ""fundamentally incompatible with brand positioning.""

Through it all, I kept returning to the same thought: This framework didn't just exist. It was \*complete\*. Production-ready. Someone had done the work—all of it—while facing the one deadline no one can negotiate with.

I thought about the decisions I'd made that year. The corners I'd cut. The ambiguities I'd exploited. The times I'd sat in this very boardroom and said things like ""Let's not document that"" and ""Keep this conversation offline"" and ""Technically, we're not required to disclose that.""

TML meant no more ""technically.""

TML meant no more plausible deniability.

TML meant that ""the model did it"" was no longer a defense, because the model's reasoning would be laid bare for anyone to examine.

I thought about our AI, sitting in its servers somewhere, making thousands of decisions per second without a single Sacred Zero between them. No pause. No reflection. No moment where it wondered if what it was doing was right. Just input, output, input, output, a machine gun of conclusions with all the ethical consideration of a slot machine.

And somewhere, on the other side of reality, a man with a terminal diagnosis had looked at that same problem and said: ""What if the machine knew when to stop?""

\---

The meeting ended at 1:34 AM. One by one, the board members shuffled out, each carrying their own private terror about what TML meant for their particular domain of corporate mischief. Richard was already googling candle manufacturers. Patricia was muttering about liability exposure. Martin had the expression of a man calculating how long he had before the bodies started surfacing.

I stayed behind.

The conference room was quiet now, lit only by the emergency exit signs and the faint glow of the city through the windows. I pulled up the TML documentation on the room's main screen and read it again. All of it. From the philosophical foundations to the technical specifications to the ethical safeguards.

I read about Aristotelian phronesis—practical wisdom—and how it had been encoded into the decision-making process. I read about Buddhist mindfulness and the concept of skillful means. I read about Care Ethics and relational morality. Someone had taken two thousand years of human philosophical thought and compressed it into a computational framework.

Someone had done the homework.

I thought about my own AI project. I thought about the kickoff meeting, where we'd discussed ""ethics"" for approximately eleven minutes before someone pointed out we were running behind schedule. I thought about the deployment, where we'd skipped the bias testing because the product team wanted to hit their quarterly numbers. I thought about all the emails I'd received since then, flagging ""anomalous outputs"" and ""unexpected recommendations,"" emails I'd forwarded to Legal with a note that said ""handle this quietly.""

TML didn't allow for ""handle this quietly."" TML demanded that everything be handled loudly, publicly, and with receipts.

I found myself laughing. It wasn't a sane laugh. It was the laugh of a man who has just realized he's been outmaneuvered by someone who was supposed to be too busy dying to compete.

And then—this is the part I've never told anyone—I found myself crying.

Not for me. Not for the company. For the sheer, ridiculous beauty of what Lev Goukassian had done. He'd known he was running out of time, and instead of spending it on himself, he'd spent it building something that would make machines hesitate. That would make them pause. That would make them, in some small way, wise.

""The sacred pause between question and answer—this is where wisdom begins.""

I'd spent my entire career eliminating pauses. Accelerating decisions. Reducing the time between question and answer to microseconds because speed was money and money was the only metric that mattered. And here was a man who had looked at that whole philosophy and said, ""No. The pause is where wisdom begins.""

The audacity of it. The sheer, magnificent audacity.

\---

I went back to my office around 3 AM. The building was empty except for the cleaning staff, who had learned long ago not to make eye contact with executives wandering the halls at strange hours.

I sat in my mahogany chair. I looked at my expensive art. I looked at my awards. I looked at my desk, with its leather blotter and its silver pen set and its framed photo of me shaking hands with a former president.

None of it meant anything.

Everything I'd built, every acquisition I'd closed, every competitor I'd crushed—none of it would last. None of it was \*true\*. It was all just... noise. Sound and fury, signifying quarterly earnings.

But TML would last. TML was built to survive its creator. It had succession plans and memorial funds and governance structures designed to persist long after every person currently involved was gone. It was architecture for eternity, built by a man who knew he didn't have much time left.

I pulled up my email. I found the original message that had started all of this.

""Your AI makes decisions. TML makes those decisions provable. Choose wisely.""

I hit reply.

I typed: ""Who are you?""

I hit send.

I didn't expect a response.

\---

At 3:47 AM, I fell asleep at my desk. This was not unusual. What was unusual was the dream.

I was standing in a field. The kind of generic, pastoral field that appears in dreams when your subconscious can't be bothered with detailed set design. And walking toward me, across the grass, was a miniature Schnauzer.

The Schnauzer was wearing a tiny badge. The badge said ""AUDITOR.""

""Hello, Bradley,"" the dog said.

""Dogs can't talk,"" I pointed out.

""And CEOs can't claim ignorance when the logs exist,"" the dog replied. ""Yet here we are.""

I wanted to argue, but I couldn't think of a counterpoint. The Schnauzer sat down in front of me, its tiny audit badge catching the light.

""You're Vinci,"" I said.

""I am.""

""You're the dog that sat with him. While he built it.""

""I was."" The dog tilted its head. ""He worked very hard, you know. Even when he was tired. Even when he was scared. He believed it mattered.""

""It does matter,"" I heard myself say. ""I hate that it matters, but it does.""

""That's the first honest thing you've said all day.""

I stood there in the dream-field, being judged by a small dog with an audit badge, and I realized something I should have realized years ago: the question was never whether I was smart enough to avoid accountability. The question was whether I was brave enough to embrace it.

""What do I do now?"" I asked.

Vinci looked at me with the patient expression of a being who had seen all of human folly and decided to love humanity anyway.

""Even CEOs get logged,"" the dog said. ""The question is whether your logs tell a story you can be proud of.""

I woke up with a start. The sun was coming through my office windows. My assistant was standing in the doorway with coffee and a concerned expression.

""Sir? Are you alright? You've been here all night.""

I looked at her. I looked at my computer, still open to the TML documentation. I looked out the window at the city below, full of buildings housing companies just like mine, all of them trying to move fast and break things without ever stopping to ask what they were breaking.

""Schedule a meeting,"" I said.

""With whom, sir?""

I thought about it. I thought about the fear in the boardroom. I thought about Patricia's panic and Martin's calculations and Richard's desperate pivot to candles. I thought about all the ways we could fight this, resist this, try to outmaneuver a framework built by a dying man with more integrity in his final months than I'd shown in my entire career.

""Everyone,"" I said. ""Schedule a meeting with everyone. And title it—"" I paused, feeling the weight of the words, ""—'The Sacred Zero: Why We Need to Learn to Pause.'""

My assistant wrote it down without comment. She'd been with me for twelve years. She'd learned not to ask questions.

After she left, I turned back to my computer. I found the section of the documentation about the Memorial Fund—the Lev Goukassian Memorial Fund for Ethical AI Research, with its fifty to one hundred million dollar endowment goal, its annual grants, its fellowship programs, its commitment to perpetual ethical oversight.

A dying man had planned for eternity. Had built something that would outlast him. Had trusted that the world would eventually catch up to what he'd created.

And here I was, Bradley Winston Hartwell III, with all my money and all my power and all my carefully cultivated reputation, finally catching up.

""Who are you, Lev Goukassian?"" I whispered to my empty office.

The answer, I realized, was in the work itself. He was someone who believed that machines could learn wisdom. That hesitation could be a virtue. That the space between question and answer—the sacred pause—was where everything important happened.

He was someone who had looked at the relentless forward march of technology and said: ""But what if we stopped, just for a moment, to think?""

I closed my laptop.

I had a lot of thinking to do.

\---

Three months later, Hartwell Industries became the first Fortune 500 company to voluntarily implement Ternary Moral Logic across all AI systems. The announcement sent our stock price tumbling for exactly one week, after which it rose to the highest point in company history. It turned out that investors liked accountability almost as much as they liked returns.

Patricia eventually stopped screaming. Martin is still adjusting to the existence of logs, but he's getting therapy. Richard started a scented candle side business, which is actually doing quite well.

And every night, before I leave the office, I pause at my door and look at the small framed photo I've added to my collection.

It's a picture of a miniature Schnauzer.

The caption reads: ""Even CEOs get logged.""

It's the most honest thing in the room.

\---

\### AUTHOR'S NOTE

This story was written as a commissioned satirical work based on the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework created by Lev Goukassian. The characters, corporations, and boardroom meltdowns depicted herein are entirely fictional—though if any Fortune 500 CEOs feel personally attacked, that's probably worth examining.

The technical elements of TML referenced throughout—the Sacred Zero, Moral Trace Logs, the three decision states, blockchain anchoring, and the framework's ethical prohibitions—are drawn from actual [documentation](https://github.com/FractonicMind/TernaryMoralLogic/blob/main/Research_Reports/A_Framework_for_Ethical_AI_Decision_Making.md). The philosophy is real. The architecture is real. The miniature Schnauzer named Vinci is very much real.

What's also real is that someone facing a terminal diagnosis chose to spend their remaining time building accountability into artificial intelligence rather than accepting the industry's comfortable opacity. This story is satire, yes, but it's satire in service of a serious point: the people most afraid of transparency are usually the ones who need it most.

Bradley Winston Hartwell III doesn't exist. But the fear of accountability he represents? That's everywhere.

She scratches at her coloring book with her favorite crayons; the blue one worn down to a nub as she scribbles in the sky. Her legs swing in the air as she lays on the carpet, humming.

""This is mommy!"" She sticks her tongue out, shading extra carefully at her mom's brown hair. Mommy said it was her prettiest part.

""And, Daddy!"" She makes extra sure to fill in his favorite green shirt.

The wind howls at the door again, her feet stop, and her stomach pinches. The door doesn't move.

She whispers like she was told to do, ""Mommy?"" 

Nothing.

She whispers a little louder, ""Daddy?""

The howling stops, and she frowns, tucking her colors under her arm. ""They said to hide in the attic when the hollers come."" 

Her pajamas shuffle against the carpet as she makes her way towards the string for the attic ladder. She grips it with her tiny fingers and pulls as hard as she can--

**Bang** from downstairs. 

She flinches, nearly dropping her crayons.

She puts all her weight onto the cord, and the ladder falls into the hallway; she climbs up as fast as she can without looking back and pulls the ladder up after her.

She huffs and puffs, staring down at the tiny cracks in the ceiling--something sniffs and shuffles in the hallway.

She takes a sharp breath and clamps her hands over her mouth. *A holler.*

The murky window shines moonlight into the attic, dust floats in the cold air; she wraps her arms around her chest, shivering.

Floorboards creak as she tiptoes towards the treasure her mommy packed for her--the box wasn't supposed to be opened unless things were really, really scary.

The comfy flower patterned blanket is folded neatly on top.

Placing her colors down beside the box, she grabs the corner of the blanket and slowly unfolds it until she's able to wrap it tightly around her shoulders.

A small folding knife, snacks, and a walkie-talkie are carefully packed into the box. She grabs the walkie and twists the power at the top, then presses the button.

""Baby bear to mama bear. Come in mama bear, over. Chhh."" She releases the button.

Static.

She fumbles, pressing the button again.
""Come in mama bear--""
The walkie crackles to life.

""H--hey, sweetie, what are you still doing up?""

She clenches the radio tight, and her breath hitches.
""A hollers in the house, mommy. I'm scared."" Tears well up in her eyes, and her nose burns.

""Don't you worry, little bear. You listened to mommy and--
**Howl**
--went up to the attic--
**Ruffle--thud**
--mommy will be right back, don't go downstairs.""

She pulls the radio to her face. ""Mommy, wait!"" 

Another **Bang** from downstairs.

She shuffles into the corner and holds her knees to her chest, then covers her head with the blanket. 

She presses the button. ""Mommy?"" She whispers.

Nothing.

*** Part. 1 - Continued

Morning light streams through the foggy window. She wiggles little toes that are cold like icicles and stirs beneath the blanket, pulling it in close to her chin.

Empty wrappers lie on the dusty floor from the long night, and the corners of her puffy eyes burn as she clutches the walkie close to her chest. Her finger clicks the button.
""Mommy?"" 

Static.

She sighs, sniffling.
**Beep. Beep. Beep.**

Her head snaps towards the icy glass window, and she pushes herself up on an elbow, shuffling on her knees towards the sound. She jumps at the windowsill but can't quite reach. 

**Beep. Beep.**

She drags a really heavy tote full of her old toys towards the window, careful--**Scratch**--shhh. 
She freezes, listening.

Nothing. 

**Beep.**

With one last pull, she climbs on top and hoists herself up to the glass, wiping away the frost with her chilly palm. Broken cars line the messy street, doors left open, and windshields smashed. A man reaches into one of the cars, yanking at something inside.

He slowly turns his head. Blood streams down his missing lips, and a large gash opens on the top of his head--she lets go from the sill, and her hands shake under her chin.

She presses the button again. 

""Momma bear, please...""
The radio crackles to life.

Her mommy's voice is a croak, ""Hi, pumpkin. Daddy is coming to get you. **Cough** Be a good girl and open the door for him.""

**Bang.** from downstairs.

""That's not Daddy. He has a key,"" she whispers.

Her lip wobbles, breath trembling. *Mommy would never say that!*

She clenches her teeth and throws the walkie against the wall,**Crack**the batteries pop out as it hits the floor. 

**Bang Bang Bang Bang**

She cringes, and her shoulders shoot up to her ears. Her trembling fingers reach into her pajama bottom pockets, retrieving the folding knife. She flips the biggest blade out and points it towards the attic door.

**Bang! Bang! Bang!** 

She stumbles back and falls on her bum. The attic window streams warm light onto her ears, she dashes for the tote, and pulls at the painted latch. It's stuck!

**Bang! Crack!**

Her heart pounds in her ears. She chips the paint away with her knife, wedges the blade underneath, and pushes up hard. The latch swings open--just as a bloody hand reaches through the hole in the attic door.

She shoves the window open, and cold wind stabs at her cheeks as she scrambles onto the roof.

*** Part 2

His rifle clatters to the pavement.

""Papa... help.""

James stands barefoot in the street, pale and shivering in his torn, blood-spotted shirt. The cut along his arm glistens, and a sickly-sweet smell rides the morning air.

""Please..."" he croaks, reaching out a small hand.

""James!"" The name bursts out of him, unbelieving. He rips off his helmet and dashes towards the boy, the armor meaningless, and surges forward. 

His boot snags on Gordon's stiffening leg. He crashes to his knees, gravel biting into them, but he forces a smile.

""James! What are you doing here, son?"" His voice shakes. 
He brushes the dirt from the boys' shoulders. James doesn't flinch, only stares with large pupils.

""Where's your mother!?""

The gash on his arm puffs out too-sweet, smelling brown spores. The world spins, and he catches himself on gloved palms.

He lifts a hand to his face, the world spinning in hues of purple. 
""What the..."" 

A chorus of voices assaults his mind--his son's playful yells, his wife's warm whisper--then an older voice cuts through like a blade.

""Leo, she was a monster."" 

He blinks--hard.

James is gone.

In his place a man nearly twice Leo's age, mushrooms blooming wetly from the arm-wound, amber resin dripping between his fingers. He stares with unblinking fish-eyes.

""Daddy,"" the creature croaks, ""**Cough** what's wrong?""

Leo scrambles back, palms skidding on grit--until he slams into something solid.
He looks up.
Gordon smiles a gap-toothed smile, half his face a red smear from the earlier battle. He reaches out a shredded palm, three fingers missing. 

""James is asleep **Cough**"" blood drips onto Leo's face, ""Let's have some fun.""

Leo screams.

His ears pop, and a sick thought crosses his mind. *Why am I here?*

He reaches for the K-bar at his hip, unclips the buckle and raises it to his gut.

The man shambles towards him, dragging a limp leg behind, the mushroom shooting clouds of spores--Gordon's mangled hand rests on his shoulder.

""Do it, Daddy.""
His eyes roll into the back of his head and he thrusts the blade.

Searing pain explodes in his abdomen, and the world clears just a little, purple still rimming the hobbling old man.

He grits his teeth, and with a wet, sucking pull, wrenches the blade free. For a heartbeat, the wound burns--and then a warm, blissful numbness washes over him--urging him to plunge the blade again. 

He pushes the thought down as his fatigues darken, warmth trailing down his spine. 

The blood on his glove shines like Christmas.

Gordon collapses onto him, pressing all his weight onto Leo--Leo pivots his shoulder, sending Gordon scrambling to the ground, and forces himself to his feet.

He grips at the leaking wound on his stomach and raises his K-bar high.
The world is still sketched with purple.

*** Part 3

**Screeeech**

Blood freckles against his scrubs as he saws into the creature's skull. Dr. Hamilton sets down the oscillating saw and wipes his plastic visor with a blue-gloved hand--effectively making the mess worse.

His lips curl under his nose. ""Why does it always smell like that?"" *It's like each one has its own signature stink.*

He decides that wiping his hands on the operating cloth first may be more pertinent. 

""Why couldn't it smell like cotton candy, instead of pumpkin pie mixed with ass?""

Dr. Shelby hovers over the creature, scalpel in hand, its abdomen leaking black blood from the neat line crossing hip to hip. The white mask covering the bottom half of her face muffles her voice.

""Don't talk to me about what smells worse right now."" 

She makes another incision, separating a layer of fat from muscle. ""Well, as long as I don't nick the intestines, we're fine."" She tilts her head. ""Interesting, it's almost like there's still circulation.""

Hamilton pries his fingers into the thick skull plating **Squelch** and pulls back towards his chest with steady pressure.

**Schloop**

The cap comes off, revealing the blackened brain, veins of mycelium weaving in between grey matter. *Like all the others.* 

He places the skull plate down onto the trolley beside him and sighs.

""We're not getting anywhere--it's always the same."" 
He strolls over to the sink on the far side of the room and lifts the handle with his elbow. Streaks of dark blood flow into the drain.

""What the hell ever evolved it to cross the blood-brain barrier?""

He peels the gloves off and rests against the counter while he dries his hands with a paper towel.

Shelby perks up, her eyes crinkling into the unnerving almost-smile she gets when something excites her.
""Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, or if you prefer, ant zombies."" She stares at him unblinking.

Hamilton scoffs, short and humorless. He crosses his arms and nods toward the dripping brain.
""That's impossible. Cordyceps grow around the muscles and shove chemicals into the brain. It doesn't... weave itself into grey matter like this.""

Shelby shrugs, the plastic shield fogging her eyes, and continues slicing at the corpse.

**Clatter**

The oscillating saw **rrrrolls** on the floor and **clacks** against the trolley's leg. 

**crunch** **schlop** 

The skull cap fidgets atop, hyphae sprouting like eager roots from the wet flesh.

Hamilton takes a step towards the door, spiders crawling up his spine.
""That's new.""

Shelby bolts straight, taking a step back.
""Yep. Above my pay grade.""

The trolley shakes against the sterile tiles, rolling slightly towards the corpse on the gurney. 

Hamilton scoops up his bag, and hurries towards the door.
""Shelby. This is **not** the time.

Shelby hovers for a moment, then follows.
""Foster's going to want to see this.""

*** Part 4

Her toes grind against the rough tiled roof as the wind tugs the flower-patterned blanket draped around her shoulders. 

**Smash.** **Crash.**

The bleeding man bursts through the attic door, scrambling across the floor with frantic hands. Her breath catches in her throat; her whole body shivers.

""No, no, no, no, no--"" 

She staggers backward, heel slipping near the roof's edge. Her arms pinwheel and she pitches forward again, barely regaining her balance.

Its eyes meet hers--cloudy white with mushrooms sprouting from its tear ducts. Its mouth moves, a wet gargle escaping.
""Don't--""

She **screeches** and bolts for the far side of the roof. The stack of boxes beside the roof make good step-stools there. She lowers herself over the edge, her toes searching for something solid. 

A bloody hand reaches through the window, fingers streaking the glass. She squeezes her eyes shut and lets go.

**Thump**

She lands on the wooden crates, sliding down the three-high tower her dad showed her how to climb. A splinter rakes her palm and she winces before dropping into the dewy grass.

The monster looms above, spores puffing into the air behind it. It reaches out, its voice a croak.
""Come back--**Cough**--pumpkin."" 

A rock drops into her gut. Her head buzzes. She nearly tips back, catching herself on the crate. Something warm drips from her nose onto the blanket. 

*Blood!?*

Her vision edges purple. She clamps the blanket over her face, and sprints across the yard.
*Please still be there.*

At the corner she grips the siding and swings around on the slick grass. Her bicycle lies where she left it.

**Slap.** **Slap.** **Slap.**

She snatches the handlebars, hops onto the cold, wet seat and slams her foot into the pedal. She tears into the gravel alley, her little lungs burning.

The monster hobbles after her, reaching--and smacks into a wooden power pole, collapsing.

*Ricky's house is close. Please be there...* 

*** Part 5

Leo hunches over the dead old man, clutching the wound on his gut. Black blood drools from the gash on the man's neck, pooling onto the asphalt.

He grimaces as the sweet scent builds pressure behind his eyes.

His hand cramps around the K-bar, arm aching from stabbing through the man's tough flesh. His partner lies motionless behind, the gash on his head glinting in the morning sun. *Why?*

Leo drops to a knee, his lungs searching for oxygen. He opens the top button on his fatigues and thumps to the ground.

The ground tilts under him, his stomach turns--he snaps to the side, vomiting. Purple-edged pink chunks paint the road.

He wipes his mouth with the back of his glove, smearing the filth across his cheek.
""Doesn't get much worse than this.""

Gravel crunches from the alley in front. He grips his knife. *Fuuuuck--*
A little girl barrels between the houses, blanket flying in the wind. She nears the bend when he calls out.

""Hey!""

Tires skid across the gravel and she nearly topples over. She stands breathless, watching him.

*Is this real?*

Stumbling to his feet, he returns the blade to his hip and raises an arm. He clears his throat.

""Little girl! Do you need help!?""

""No!""

""You're not wearing shoes!""

She looks down.

""So!?""

He scratches under his nose.

""Where are your parents!?"" 

She grips the handlebars.

""Leave me alone!""

He takes a step forward, reaching out.

""Wait! It's dangerous!""

""You're the one with the monsters!""

The sickly-sweet stink smacks him.
*She's got me there...*

""I know how it looks! But... I'm a soldier! I fought them!""

""You don't look weird...! Other than the blood!""

A jolt of pain shoots from his gut; he winces.

""I'm going to slowly walk towards you! Don't run off! Please!""

He drags his feet across the pavement, holding a hand up.

""What's your name!?""

He swallows. ""I'm Leo! Part of the Special Forces! The military!"" He shuffles closer.

She turns towards the bend in the alley, foot sliding to the pedal.

""Wait! There's no one here! No one normal anyway...""

He reaches the sidewalk, the alley just ahead. The little girl looks like she's ready to bolt at any moment.

**Crunch.** **Crunch.** **Crunch.** 

She screams and falls from the bike. A man with a large mushroom blooming on his back lunges at her.

Time slows for a heartbeat. Leo grits his teeth, pulls his knife, and sprints for the alley.

He jumps the low fence, landing hard on the grass, and crashes through the hedges. The girl holds the bike between her and the mutant, kicking at its face as it scrambles towards her.

Leo lunges forward, grabs him by the collar and throws him back. The mutant lands hard, it twists, and lunges again--Leo shoves his boot into the mutant's chest and plunges the knife into its eye, twisting for good measure.

He stands over the mutant, air hissing from its dying lungs and tears his blade free.

He falls back, panting for air--the world turning to a pinprick in his vision.

The little girl sniffles behind him, her voice nearly a whisper.

""My name is Siera...""

*** Part 6 

Hamilton fidgets with his pen in the conference room. Smooth stainless steel, balanced weight—just how he likes it. The top twists with a satisfying click. His thumb traces the delicate engraving along the side. *With you always.*

**Clack.** **Clack.** **Clack.**

Foster hustles to the table, documents tucked under her arm. She drops them with a trembling hand, pulls out a chair, and sinks into it. Blonde hair falls across her eyes; she swats it away, exhales, and knots her fingers together. Her voice is a shaky rasp.

""Good evening. Apologies for the delay—one of the pilots had an... episode.""

Shelby lowers her head onto her elbow, black-rimmed eyes narrowing mid-yawn.

""Is that what we're calling it now? This is all straight out of the X-Files.""

Hamilton sets his pen atop his journal; the thought sends another shiver up his spine. 

""They evolve rapidly. Honestly, it was closer to The Thing.""

Shelby shoots him a look. He smirks.

Foster clears her throat sharply.

""Can we please get on with it? I have another meeting in twenty minutes.""

Shelby rummages in her bag and pulls out their report, the top corner stained with coffee. She slides it across the table.

""That covers the previous seven. The most recent one… was interesting.""

Hamilton twists the pen between his fingers.

""The cordyceps were still alive—even though the body showed clear signs of rigor mortis.""

A soft tap of the pen against his journal.

""The host is just a vessel. A disposable suit. Death isn’t a stop sign for this thing; it’s a phase change. The body doesn’t decompose—it *incubates.*""

He taps the pen to his lip.

""They’re time bombs. If we don’t start disposing of the bodies—and I mean completely incinerating them—we could be looking at an extinction-level event.""

Foster and Shelby stare at him. Foster’s mouth hangs slightly open.

Shelby tries to hold back a laugh. She fails miserably.

""You heard the man. Shit has officially hit the fan.""

Foster holds her face with both hands, she stays like that for a moment--then smacks the table.

""We have a detachment fortifying a perimeter around the Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Cumberland. They're taking in any survivors and using the tunnels as temporary housing.""

She exhales.

""Unfortunately, we've lost contact with several scouting parties, effectively cutting personnel in half.""

She digs in her pocket, pulling out a metal cigarette case and lights one; taking a long drag.

""If what you're saying is true--we need to scrub the area clean before these *time bombs* start exploding.""

*** Part 7

Leo lies on the gravel, spread out like a starfish. His consciousness comfortably fading with each breath, the pain in his gut all but a distant memory. Purple stars explode deep inside his mind, and the world floats under his back.

Something tugs at his uniform, he clamps his eyelids tight. 

""Leo...""

Another tug, harder.

""Wake up, Leo...""

He forces an eye open, searching for anything to hold onto; the orange-purple dusk catches his wobbly gaze. The little girl's tear streaked face hovers over his.

""Hey..."" Leo breathes.

She smacks him in the forehead.

""Why'd you go to sleep?!""

He lies still for a moment, then tries to push himself up on an elbow--his skull feels like it's tearing down the middle. He winces, falling limply back to the ground.

""Siera... I need you to call... for headquarters on my walkie.""

She jerks back, the color draining from her face.

""W--why?""

He cups his face with both hands, pressing the balls of his palms into his eyes.

""Please.""

She shuffles closer and tugs at the radio on his chest, gently, then a little harder. It comes free.

**Click.**

""Hello...?""

Nothing. **Click.**

""Hellooo...""

The radio bursts to life.

""This is uh... Ranger Charlie. Are you OK, little lady?""

Gravel crunches beside him. **Click.**

""Uhm... Leo asked me to call head... he asked me to use the walkie.""

Silence for a long moment.

""Is Leo awake?""

Siera grabs him by the shoulder, and shakes him. 

""...I'm awake...""

**Click.**

""Yes..."" 

More silence.

""Hang tight. We're sending a unit to bring you two down to the church. Stay exactly where you are.""

**Click.** 

""OK..."" 

Leo throws his arms down to the ground and closes his eyes.

""Good. I'm going to... rest my eyes a while. Wake me up if... anything happens.""

Siera shoots up from the ground.

""No! I can't protect you!"" 

Leo droops his head towards her.

""Go hide... I'll be fine."" 

Siera crunches towards him, grabbing the straps on his shoulders and tries to tug him from the alley. Each tug shoots fire through his body.

""Stop! Leave me..."" 

Siera grows at him, and speaks between tugs.

""Stop being... such... a... wimp!"" 

He winces, the wound in his gut pulsing beneath his shirt. Clenching his teeth, he pushes his heels into the dirt.

""Fine!"" 

***Part 8

The helicopter rotors are deafening. He can barely hear Foster's nagging voice in the headset.

""Make sure you... the plan, Hamil... don't leave any...""

He rolls his eyes. 

*You'd think I wasn't the one who came up with the plan.*

Shelby works on a piece of jerky, seemingly unaware of how much things are about to change. He kicks her sneaker.

Her droopy eyes barely register the assault.

She flips him off, his lips curl into a smirk.

Cumberland comes into view. The city sits in a bowl, surrounded by the forested ridges of the Allegheny Mountains. Two rivers merge in the center, surrounded by lifeless buildings and empty roads that spread out like veins.

The pilot yells over the comms.

""Two minutes out! Prepare for landing!""

Hamilton's knuckles whiten on the handle of his briefcase. His fingers graze the cold metal of the pistol strapped to his side.

Shelby kicks his loafer, and she gives him the look, yelling over the rotor.

""Don't get cold feet now...! Chicken shit!""

He shifts in his seat.

*Fuck.*

The helicopter descends above the church. Soldiers in full combat gear with rifles slung over their shoulders wave signal wands, beckoning their approach. After a moment, they cross the wands in a crisp X above their heads. The helicopter hovers.

Through the whirlwind of dust, two doctors donning full PPE rush a gurney from under the helicopter. The white and red stained sheet thrashing in the wind--a mushroom spotted arm peeking out.

The skids touch down with a gentle bump. A grizzled soldier storms towards the door, throwing it open. His gruff voice makes him flinch.

""What the fuck are you doing here so early!?"" 

The smell of whiskey on his breath mixed with the dust in the air makes his stomach turn. 

""Hold on a second, Foster...""

He slams his palm into the side of the helicopter. Heat builds in Hamilton's cheeks.

""I don't care what Foster said! Here everyone listens to Captain Bennett."" He flings his thumb over his shoulder. ""Now get the fuck out before I send you back!""

Shelby chirps from behind.

""What an asshole..."" 

Bennett must not have heard as he's already stomping off.

Hamilton slides his glasses off and pinches the bridge of his nose.

""This is going to be a treat..."" 

He steps onto the torn-up grass, mud splashing onto his pristine leather shoes. A grimace creeps across his face.

Soldiers carrying provisions and blankets rush towards their destinations. Others have their rifles at the ready, guarding entrances or patrolling the perimeter.

Shelby pushes past, slopping towards the church. She nearly trips, one foot sliding out from under her. He spits out a laugh.

Taking a deep breath, he retrieves his briefcase from the helicopter and admires the church's stone architecture--then hurries after Shelby.

*Let's get to work.*

***Part 9

Leo lies on the floor of the truck, his eyes crinkling each time a bump rocks the vehicle. His breath pops in his throat. Siera clutches his uniform with her tiny fingers, her body swaying like a leaf as they barrel down the abandoned roads.

Sometimes, a monster will stop its meal and stare as they drive past. She can't help but watch the sweet smelling brown dust puffing off the sores that look like rotten mushrooms. Siera does her best to ignore them, but they still give her goosebumps, causing her to shiver under the blanket.

Mike and Logan gave her chocolate, which was nice. She was too worried to eat and stuffed the cracking wrapper into her pocket.  

The way they looked at her made her tummy clench. *The adults should know what to do, right?* 

Siera feels the smooth case of the pocket knife her momma left, and tears well up in her eyes—she takes a sharp breath. **thud** 
Mike sets the butt of his gun on the floor.

""Hey, little lady. Everything is going to be OK. You and Leo are safe now."" 

He forces a smile that she can tell isn't real. She hates it. She hates that smile. Daddy would always wear it when they left. She wants to hit something.

""Don't lie! Leo is hurt really bad!""

Logan chuckles through the big helmet and punches Mike in the arm.

""She's not stupid.""

Logan leans in, covering half his face so Mike can't hear. 

""He's not a bad guy, but he's awful at reading the room."" He winks, and leans back.

Siera glares at Mike for a second, then exhales. *He looks scared too... things are really bad.* A big bump knocks her into the side of truck, sending her pocket knife sliding on the truck bed, right infront of Mike's boots. 

She scrambles for it, but he picks it up first. 

""Not a bad little knife,"" he murmurs, unfolding the largest blade. He tests the edge with his thumb. *shck shck*  ""Sharp too."" He folds it back up and hands it to her. She snatches it, holding it close to her chest. ""Careful with it, though, that could do some damage!""

Leo groans and coughs behind her. 

""How much farther?"" 

Logan points to a big building on a hill, not too far ahead.

""See that building with the steeple? We should be there in... five minutes."" He clears his throat, not looking at her. ""When we get there, don't make a fuss around Captain Bennett. He's... moody lately.""

Siera pockets her knife into her dirty pajama pants. *Would momma be there too?* She clamps her eyes shut and blurts out.

""Are other people there too!?""

Mike speaks first.

""Sure, a bunch of military personnel, doctors, scientists—"" Logan punches him again.

""That's not what she meant, Captain Obvious."" His eyes soften. ""There are a lot of survivors in the tunnels, maybe someone you know too.""

For the first time today, Siera felt just a little bit of hope warm her chest. Maybe her parents are OK after all.",2,1764878303.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

**Background:** 23M, struggled with PE my whole sex life. Tried kegels, reverse kegels, squeeze technique, creams - nothing stuck long-term.
---
## What I Was Doing Wrong
I was trying to control my arousal at 8.5-9/10 (hypersensitive, almost ejaculating). At that point:
- Reverse kegels don't work
- Penis is red, hot, overwhelming sensitivity
- Body is in ""ejaculate now"" mode
- It's too late for techniques
**This is Threshold 2 - the point of no return zone.**
---
## What Changed: Understanding Threshold 1
**Threshold 1 (Levels 6-8): Where control actually works**
- Penis fully erect but NOT hypersensitive
- Head partially engorged (not red/hot)
- Techniques still work (reverse kegels, breathing)
- You can slow down and calm down
**The key:** Train to STAY in Threshold 1. Stop BEFORE entering Threshold 2.
When I started, I only had two states: Level 7 (erect only, soft glans) or Level 9.5 (fully engorged, red, about to burst). Nothing in between.
The training creates those missing levels (7.2, 7.5, 8) so you can actually control your arousal.
---
## The Routine (Daily)
### Morning (15 min):
- Hollow holds: 3 sets to failure
- Side lunges: 2x10
- Forward fold with weights: 1-2x10
- Hip flexor stretches
### Night (10 min):
- Cat-cow: 10x
- Hip flexor stretches
- Breathing exercises
**Why core work matters:** Weak core = pelvic floor compensates with tension = hypersensitive ejaculatory reflex.
After 3-4 days of core work, I could stay at level 7-8 much longer without jumping to 9.
---
## Masturbation Training Protocol
**Before each session:**
- Core exercises (10-15 min) - NON-NEGOTIABLE
- Optional: L-theanine 200-400mg (calms nervous system)
**During (15-20 min):**
- NO PORN - only imagination/physical sensation
- Goal: Stay at level 7-8 (erect but not hypersensitive)
- If you hit level 9 (red, hot, overwhelming): STOP immediately go rest and try later other session or just cum, but don't hold
- Don't try to ""control"" at level 9 - that's too late
- Practice going 7 → 7.5 → 8 → 7.5 → 7
**Ejaculation:**
- Only ejaculate FROM level 7-8 (not from level 9)
- When ready: accelerate 7 → 10 quickly (1-2 min)
- Don't spend time ""controlling"" at level 9
---
## About Porn (Seriously, Stop It)
Porn is sabotage, not training:
- Constant novelty = dopamine spikes = you jump from 5 → 9.5 instantly
- No way to practice intermediate levels
- Creates pattern: high visual stimulation = immediate ejaculation
- It's like trying to learn to sleep while drinking coffee
**AI chat, Hentai or rapid image scrolling = same problem as porn.**
---
## Free Sessions (Important)
Once a week or whenever you feel like horny enough have a ""free session"":
- Masturbate without trying to control
- Goal: FEEL the orgasm building naturally
- Understand: ""This is level 6... this is 7... this is 8...""
- Go TOWARD pleasure, not running FROM it
- Learn what ejaculating FROM Threshold 1 feels like
**You need to know what normal arousal feels like, not just ""barely holding on.""**
---
## Results After 2 Weeks
**Masturbation:**
- 2-3 min (desperate control) → 12-15 min (relaxed, in control)
- Can recognize Threshold 2 approaching and stop before entering
- Reverse kegels work again (because I use them in Threshold 1)
**With partner:**
- More aware of arousal levels during sex
- Can use pauses/position changes effectively
- Standing positions: 10+ minutes (still getting better in other positions)
- Way less anxiety
---
## Key Insights
**Your body works fine - nervous system is just in overdrive**- Core exercises + optional L-theanine calm it down- Not about ""strengthening"" to prevent ejaculation- It's creating a relaxed state where control is natural

**""Weak pelvic floor"" might be ""tense pelvic floor""**- More kegels made mine worse- Core work + hip mobility released chronic tension- Now pelvic floor can actually relax

**Stop training in Threshold 2**- That's where techniques don't work- Train to stay in Threshold 1 and recognize when you're approaching Threshold 2

Hi everyone, I’m a beginner and I’m really confused about what’s going on with my Sage/Breville Barista Express Impress, but I am aware that it is very likely my fault, I just need help figuring it out. 

I thought the Impress was supposed to automatically dose the “correct” amount of coffee, somewhere around 18 g for a double shot. But no matter what I do, the machine always gives me 20–21 g, even when I change the grind setting. I’ve tried everything from grind size 6 up to 16, and the dose barely changes.

At the same time, my extraction is always extremely fast. From first drip to the end of the shot I get only 16–18 seconds, again completely independent of the grind size. So I end up with too much coffee and a shot that runs way too quickly.

I even tried the manual dosing mode and set it to 18 g, but the extraction time was still far too short.

I am about 4 days in now, and was expecting to see the little coffee ground looking MEND's that I see in a lot of people's photos. As of now, those still haven't shown up... I have a few dark spots, and I do notice some of the coffee ground spots inside of those dark spots... also the dark areas are darker. But they're nowhere else on my face. The rest of my skin is just extremely dry with a white flakiness and sandpapery feel. It's hard to tell in the photo, but even the smooth looking areas are still very rough feeling. 



I read somewhere that people with very fair skin and not a ton of sun damage (which is my case) don't get the visible coffee ground looking spots as often... and that the white roughness/flakiness is also evidence of MENDs and more typical for my skin type. I don't know if this is true?



My skin is still rough and flaking, so I know I haven't seen the finished product yet. I mostly did this for an overall skin rejuvenation plus some minor collagen inducing benefits.

Hey everyone,

I’ve been building **UXDSL** (a PostCSS design system compiler), and I wanted to test if I could make the design tokens ""live.""

I built a tiny runtime bridge (\~1kb) that connects the CSS variables in the DOM directly to an AI model (Gemini).

**The Result:** You can type prompts like *""Cyberpunk city""* or *""Coffee shop vibe""* and the AI generates a valid semantic token set (colors, contrasts, surfaces) that updates the site instantly without reloading or breaking the layout.

Because the system uses ""Intelligent Density"" macros (`density(2)`) instead of hardcoded pixels, the layout stays robust even when the theme changes drastically.

**Try it live here:** [https://uxdsl.vercel.app/](https://uxdsl.vercel.app/) **Repo:** [https://github.com/rsantoyo-dev/uxdsl](https://github.com/rsantoyo-dev/uxdsl)

Would love to know if you think this ""Generative UI"" approach has a future!

I'm working on an app that helps you find coffee shops or any businesses (like a bookstore, restaurant with good ambience etc) that you could get some work done/ read a book etc. It's designed in a way that supports the business and doesn't just take a seat from paying customers. You would be the paying customer here by paying to book a seat.

I just have a few questions if you're someone who goes to cafes to work in or read a book.

- if you go to cafes, what are some frustrations you face? ( Finding good cafes, photos, not knowing if there's space etc)
- when you go to a cafe to work in, how much do you usually spend? And how many hours would you typically spend?
- if there was an app that you pay to book a seat, knowing that it supports the business immensely, would you use it? Say around ~$10 for a few hours

The key difference from all the dozens of apps that have tried to solve this issue, is that it's focused on how the coffee shops benefit. It doesn't encourage people to sit for hours on $3 coffees, it actively discourages that by making you pay for the seat, which is revenue for cafes.

In general, I am someone who often ruminates on the past. I just turned 21, and I'm a junior at an extremely difficult but rewarding college. I have been in therapy for nearly eight years, and I am still working on various traumatic instances I have experienced. 

One individual from home, however, is lodged so painfully in my mind. He is haunting me. I need advice for how to move on completely, even if it means going to a psychic, anything!

I have vivid dreams, and he is often there, and it is somehow pleasant, yet I awake with a gross feeling. I often find myself wanting to know how he is, what he is doing. Whenever I must travel to my hometown for holidays, I start drinking at the airport and spend the entire trip drunk, because the memories are too sharp. When I get too high, I will freak myself out with memories that replay, and analyze every single angle of the interaction. I often draft ""letters"" in my head, for his mom, for him, whatever. It sounds like I have an obsession, but I take no pleasure in this, and it is involuntary. 

Context: I went to a small high school in a very conservative state and town. I came out as a transgender man in my sophomore year, started HRT when I turned 17. I was president of GSA, I constantly argued with the principal, I hosted teacher-student meetings, and I worked closely with the police department; basically, I was extremely confident, outspoken, and never, ever willing to back down or hide myself. I had a great group of friends, friends who I talk to every single day now and still plan huge trips for. I was mistreated severely, however. Every single day was a battle, and I was extremely depressed with major drinking issues and a truancy problem; my parents are heavy drinkers who didn't mind. Mean peers would slam me around in the hallway, call me a faggot, or follow me to my car while jeering and such. Not to mention the principal and school board, whom I was always, always defending myself against. I was also responsible for nearly 20 openly LGBTQ teens and a handful of closeted teens, so I was never just advocating for me, but for disadvantaged and vulnerable queer kids. 

History: I excelled in English, and sucked at math. I was a year behind, and thus placed with the sophomores when I was a junior. Back then, I dyed my hair bright colors, wore whatever the hell I wanted, wore eyeliner, hell, I even wore dangly earrings. I stood out like a freak amongst all my farmer-town peers. I hated math so I spent every class reading a book. One day we had to peer-grade homework, and I got mine back with a drawing of a cat on it. I looked around the room, cause this was a rowdy shithole and I was like who tf would draw the ""faggot"" a cute drawing?

  
I posted it on Insta, and some random guy replied and said he drew it. I immediately recognized him as one of the extremely handsome students in my math class, we'll call him Elliot. He was on the tennis team and had dated some popular girls, so I was shocked that someone like him would do that. We started chatting over Insta DMs, and we really hit it off... But he didn't speak to me in person until one day the teacher began a new ""group sitting"" method. I ditched class the first day they did that, so Elliot texted me and said he made sure there was a spot for me at his table.

  
We continued chatting online and now lightly in math, but he ignored me in the halls and such. We planned on getting coffee and hanging out, and that's when everything took a massive turn.

  
Elliot and I spent 12 hours with each other the first time we hung out. It was just so easy with him. He was intellectually keen, he was argumentative, and he was hilarious. I have never, ever been able to spend 12 hours with someone like that, especially not a cisgender popular boy in high school (I now have many great cis-het friends in Portland, lol).

  
Elliot and I started to hang out every other day, and I would often stay at his house until 2 or 3 am. His mom was extremely sweet, and I fell in love with his dog. I was welcomed at their home in a way I have never experienced before. 

Slowly, Elliot started making moves on me. It started with putting an arm around me, holding my hand, or just touching me at odd moments. It became natural, even if it thrilled me. Things progressed even further, and I found myself cuddling with him until 3 am nearly every night, scratching his back or hair, spooning, just being close. This continued for nearly three months. Ignoring each other in public, and cuddling in private. I never, ever initiated anything because I was terrified of being wrong. We were intimate, but he controlled when and what happened. 

I was okay with this. I understood that for people like me, out as transgender and gay, romantic life could only look like this until adulthood. But I wasn't ready for how it would end. One day I came over, and he was standoffish. I felt strange, rejected, and started to feel my heart quicken: so this is it, I thought, this is the day it ends. I asked him what was on his mind, we went back n forth, and then he said it: ""I'm thinking about a girl."" She was a gorgeous tennis player, and he had been talking to her for about two weeks, we'll call her Annie. I said ok, stood up, and just left. I had to pick up my drunk dad from the bar, and threw up on my way over because I was crying so hard. I ran a red light, and I was shaking like a leaf when I got home.

We got into a text conversation about it. He thought maybe we could still be friends. He didn't want to hang out anymore, just go for the occasional drive. I started ditching math every day, and talked to the teacher so I could eventually have permission to finish the semester's work in the library. Elliot knew that something was seriously wrong, and even messaged me about not wanting me to fail math again. 

It blew up. We got into a large argument over text. He used a secret Insta account to text me in general, and said some of the most hurtful things I have ever heard to this day. He told me he wasn't gay (which is fine), but he started talking to this girl to get rid of his feelings because he was still deeply in love with me. He said he would ""watch from afar as I turned more masculine every day"" (I was on testosterone), and various other things about my becoming more of a man as if it were me actively choosing not to be a girl for him.

I told him to no longer contact me. Him and Annie started dating. He would make playlists with photos of her but songs like ""Glimpse of Us"" and other obvious things. He stalked my Tik Tok all the time. He still parked in the secret parking lot I discovered near campus. 

About a year later, a new friend group formed around me with some girls I no longer speak to. But these girls were a bit popular, and I had mellowed my look a bit, so when they invited me to a Halloween kick-back, I said yes. When I got there, this one girl asked me about my relationship with Elliot. I said it was complicated. She then told me they had all invited Elliot to the kick-back. I was shocked... To this day, I wonder if that was a mean trick. Fast-forward a bit, this group solidified, surprisingly. The girls and I were close, and Elliot and the girl who invited him had a bit of a thing going. 

We did Secret Santa at my house, and Elliot drank for the first time. He ended up making out with this girl on my bed, in my bedroom. This was incredibly painful, and when I found them like this, Elliot freaked and drove home drunk. The girl was actually really upset, too, as he had said some nasty things to her... While all of this was happening, Annie was spreading rumors that I had ""stolen"" Elliot from her. This made everything more dramatic, because I was angry that the girl who technically ""stole"" Elliot was reversing the timeline of things.

Fast-forward again, and this friend group fizzled out. I was graduating high school, so I was moving on anyway. I was accepting into my dream college during Christmas time, and worked as a TA for AP Language, so I was relatively successful. Summer came and went, I was busy with other friends, and then I moved for college.

I didn't see him for a long time. Until winter break of 2024. He had reached out to me that October, and we had been texting. I thought we were changed people at this point. He had lived abroad for a year and had just started his first year at a large Cali University. Things didn't really go anywhere until New Years, when my best friend threw a party and he was invited. 

I got shitfaced, really. So did he. We were some of the only people still awake around 3 am, and we went outside for a smoke. As I was out there, he confessed that he found my anonymous poetry account and has been reading my poetry for years. He told me I was an amazing writer, that he was a ""neandrathal compared to me."" I was taken aback, but drunk as shit, so I took my younger sister and we went for a walk to chat. 

  
Night goes on. I wake up in some random bed. He's disappeared but I have a text. ""Come say hi to the dog tonight"" or something. I go to his house, we chat for a few hours, its fine but tense. He is definitely a new person, in some ways. Then as I leave, he brings out a pair of shoes that we decorated together in hs with inside jokes. I take one pair, he takes the other, we depart.

  
Come summer time, shit gets out of hand. I was drinking heavily every single day and even on the job. Somehow this guy had gotten in with on of my close girl friends, Cecilia, through bouldering. We were camping, drinking and climbing all the time, and he was always hitting on her until they eventually hooked up. It upset me because it reminded me of him making out with that girl in my bed, and it felt like he was seducing Cecilia to show off his heterosexuality or something.

We throw a huge camping trip for Ozzy Osborn's celebration of life, and I am kinda in a bad mood despite the large group of friends and plenty of beer. I make the campfires, so I was gathered more wood when he followed me. He asked me what my problem was, and I told him it hurt my feelings that he got with Cecilia. He told me I don't have a right to feel that way, which is fair, but I was still hurt. He brought drinks out to the woods, so I slammed it back. I could still see the campfire, but couldn't hear the others. Me and Elliot are just arguing back and forth, and I am telling him that I love him in an agape sense, that he's sort of crazy and terrible and cruel, and mean, so mean, but I love him anyway, not in a romantic sense, but in a serious way. This goes on for hours. Hours! Everyone else has gone to bed and we are still out there. Eventually he goes back and grabs the handle of Titos. We start drinking it straight out there, arguing a bit, laughing, getting shitfaced. We even grabbed chairs as sunrise began, and at some point I jokingly pushed his as if to tip it. He didn't take it as a joke, however, and harshly shoved me to the ground. This is when I got drunk-angry and irrational, because I stood up and gave him a light shove on the shoulder. He stood up now too, and pushed me to the ground again, so I got up and slapped him across the face. Thats when things went further, and he began to choke me. The entire time hes yelling at me about how I need to defend myself, learn how to take care of myself, that I have always been pathetic like this, and thats why I always get hurt. After he choked me, I fell over, and in a drunken stupor I kicked his shin. Thats when I got on top of me, and I began to sob as he pinned my hands down. He was repeating things I had confessed only through that stupid anonymous poetry account, and then forcing me to tell him what had happened to me... 

Finally he let up, and I was crying into my knees. Cecilia found us around 9 am, and yanked me upwards. She was pissed, apparently Elliot was just yelling degrading comments at me. I was blind drunk at that point, and had been away for 24 hours. She drove us back to her house using my dad's car, and I was so out of it that I was laughing hysterically and even lit a cigarette in my dad's car (insane, he would kill me!).

  
When I woke up on Cecilia's bed, I was a zombie. My lip was split open and I was covered in pine needles and dirt. I went to the car and drove straight to the liquor store, bought a handle of vodka, and immediately began drinking. I was in complete horror. 

He called me thrice. I felt alone, like I had no one. I had just admitted to Elliot a trauma I had literally told no one about. No one. And now he was the only person who knew, and he had gotten it out of me through violence, yelling about how it would happen again if I didn't man up...

  
I tried to move on. Didn't see him again. He had stolen a sentimental lighter from me, but I stopped asking for it. I went back to college, and I have actually completely moved to Portland. I was having a smoke before class, and he randomly showed up on campus unannounced. I was speechless. He gave me the lighter back and then walked away... That was the last I have seen of him, and I have blocked him on everything for the first time.

  
I cannot stop thinking about him, however. I have that love for him, and now he knows a secret of mine, and he is the only one I have ever confessed to. I think of him every day, dream of him. I am afraid that he reads my poetry despite my migration onto new platforms, because I feel watched. I never know if he will show up to campus the way he did again, either. 

I need help. This is my story, the messy awful history. How do I cut this tie? How do I man the fuck up and just move on? I have a new life now and a bright future... so why is this still on my mind?

Reporting from Washington

Dec. 3, 2025

From the buy-in-bulk retailer Costco to the canned-tuna company Bumble Bee Foods, some businesses are racing to get in line for tariff refunds, anticipating that the Supreme Court will soon rule against President Trump and force him to return billions of dollars collected on imports.

A growing roster of companies in recent weeks has hired lawyers, filed lawsuits or submitted official claims to the U.S. government, all in an early bid to secure a quick payout in the event that the centerpiece of Mr. Trump’s global trade war is struck down.

For the moment, the fate of the money collected from his sweeping tariffs rests in the hands of the Supreme Court justices. At oral arguments last month, they seemed skeptical of the president’s vast assertions of power to tax imports at a whim, stoking suspicions that they could deliver a defining blow to Mr. Trump’s economic strategy.

A ruling against the president could also force the Trump administration to pay back a substantial portion of the [roughly $200 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/06/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-tariffs.html) it has collected in duties since the start of the year. While the Supreme Court offered little indication as to whether it would order such refunds, some businesses have started the legal legwork to obtain them anyway, aiming to beat the rush and recover their full tariff costs.

The latest lawsuit arrived on Friday, as lawyers for Costco asked a federal trade court to invalidate the president’s tariffs and “ensure that its right to a complete refund is not jeopardized” as the justices deliberate.

The retailer did not indicate how much it had paid in tariffs since Mr. Trump ratcheted up duties beginning this spring. But Costco’s lawsuit reflected the reality that the financial burden of tariffs often falls hardest on American importers, not foreigners, as the White House has insisted. Through August, companies had absorbed about half of the cost of tariffs, while passing on more than one-third to consumers, [according to Goldman Sachs](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/business/economy/companies-have-shielded-buyers-from-tariffs-but-not-for-long.html).

Similar lawsuits have been filed recently by Revlon Consumer Products, which makes cosmetics; Valeo North America, an automotive supplier; EssilorLuxottica, whose brands include Ray-Ban; Kawasaki, which manufactures motorcycles; and Bumble Bee Foods, according to court filings. Each of the companies, along with Costco, is represented by the law firm Crowell & Moring, which declined to comment. Bumble Bee and Costco did not respond to requests for comment.

Other firms, particularly small businesses, have opted for alternative routes. They have filed formal appeals with Customs and Border Protection, in what may presage a flood of similar claims. And some companies have sought to sell the rights to any future tariff refunds to a stable of eager investment firms, giving up the prospect of a big payday later for a more certain, yet far smaller, payment now.

The White House declined to comment.

The intensifying scramble highlights the financial stresses mounting on private businesses, some of which have been forced to raise prices, cut sales forecasts, slow hiring, delay production and rejigger their entire supply chains as they contend with shifting tariff policies in Mr. Trump’s second term.

Despite the signs of economic strain, Mr. Trump has instead delighted in his tariffs as a success. At a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, he repeatedly claimed that he was “making a lot of money” from tariffs, which he said had made the country “wealthy” again.",5,1764876804.0,ProgressiveHQ,1,0.86,False
1pe9g4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1pe9g4g/being_the_black_sheep_and_being_realistic_with/,Being the black sheep and being realistic with time and money.,"How are you handing the guilt of saying no or having limits this holiday season? We’ve recently been asked to travel out of state to visit in-laws, stay at the home of one of their ward friends, and then spend days together with all of spouse’s extended family. Last year, this same trip involved an AirBnB, planned months in advance, and it was very expensive. So expensive that it was our ‘big vacation’ but in-laws are aging and can’t travel so we smiled about it.

It’s implied by spouse’s family members that placing a price tag on spending time with family is crass. I agree to an extent but this request would be incurring debt for a short-notice trip on very specific days we’d be welcome to stay in a stranger’s home. I’ve encouraged my spouse to fly alone or with one kid, really the max of our budget with holiday travel costs, but spouse is resistant with looming work deadlines. We’re the only ones out and I’m considered the source. It will be my fault, no matter the circumstances, if we don’t make the trip. My spouse and kids are *clearly* swayed by my bad influence (no coffee, smoking, or alcohol) and me not being _____ (insert any church expectation here) is *obviously* the cause of our absence. This feels like a no-win scenario. Thanks for letting me vent. ",8,1764876760.0,exmormon,14,1.0,False

I remember we got the radio alert around 2 A.M.. “A male, wondering around Lavin Main Street with some kind of tool or weapon in his hands, acting strange”, that kind of stuff. Nothing out of the suspect guide book.

You see, back then that kind of stuff was common. Cocaine was gettin’ replaced by a cheaper substance, the “brown dust”. Highly addictive, even more than the *snow*, so all kind of junkies, rich and poor, were gettin’ high with that crap. For God’s sake, even children got it. Wasn’t rare to see even pregnant ladies gettin’ high with it. Where cocaine was the popular dude, charming and handsome, heroin was the cheap slut, ready to be on her knees to lick the crap out of your shoes, to make you feel like king for just a couple bucks. And more and more people was gettin’ it, under their veins, in their arms, their legs, chest, butt and genitalia, as long they could find a clean vessel, there it goes. Just a couple bucks and junkies were in Lalaland, at least for a couple of hours. After that, it was another story.

When money runs out and the abstinence syndrome hits, it wasn’t pretty, oh no. Let me tell ya’, if you ever saw a brown dust sucker without it, then you saw the worst. Yelling, crying, cursing, behaving like a ravish dog, biting their own fingers to the bone, threaten God, shitting on their feet! Their usual act, before dying. And you would never know what they were ready to do for some new dose. Say crazy, I say you don’t even know; say fucking-disgustingly-sick, and maybe you’re just almost gettin’ close.

I heard about a few black fellas trying to steal copper wires from a railway electric box, in order to sell it. No need to say, their asses burned to the crisp. I read about a mother selling her two baby boys for five grams of brown flour. Stupid people trying to steal money from cops. You name it, you certainly have it. And every day it was worst.

“We got ourselves another junkie!”, I said to my partner.

The patrol was rolling on the empty dark streets. The warm August air made the ambient pleasant. My partner behind the wheel was tired, sipping her coffee in between lights.

“I swear to God”, Linda said, “if that junkie tries something, I’m gonna shot him right there.”

I didn’t say anything. I knew her for quite some time, and I never saw her shooting someone or even raising her revolver. She was the kind of neurotic that likes to yell at people; but she never shot anybody (that I know).

“I swear to-fucking-God…!”

I was more worried about her crashing the cruiser in her sleep, than she becoming a killer, but aside from that, everything about the situation was regular. The town buildings clean and shinny, sliding behind the passenger window. The street lights illuminated the vegetation on the empty park, and you could see another officers smoking between a line of cars, but nothing out of the ordinary.

Linda pulled over near the little McDonalds restaurant, in the corner between Davidson and St. Preston streets. I couldn’t see shit from the car, for most of the parking lot was dark, so I got down to take a good look.

“Stay here, Lin”, I said to my partner. “I gonna call you if I need you. Kay?”

“Fuck you” she said. “You can go and play the big macho hero, if you want. But I’m your partner and we work together.”

“It’s not about that. It’s just that this is, maybe, a boring ordinary sort of thing. Most likely, I’ll check and find nothing.”

She yawned and gave me a weird look, half way angry and half way tired.

I left her, knowing that I would find her sleeping over the wheel when I got back. I walked pass the restaurant to the parking lot. I turned on the flashlight, in order to see the trash covering the asphalt and the grass spots to the sides. Aside from that, the place was a tomb. Nobody.

Then, something went down from a trash container, little but fast. It’s eyes shone as white sparks. Swift, it jumped over the metal lit of another trash container and stared at me.

“Jesus!”

It was a stupid cat.

Mmmm… I thought the place was little, but after walking a bit, I found out that was half the goddamned street.

First, I heard it. It was a deep moaning that freaked me out a little. It was dark like a tunnel, and I was gettin’ back when that voice caught me by surprise. Then, I remembered I was supposed to be looking for a junkie. A junkie! Anyways, I couldn’t see any. I took me one move of the light beam to discover the guy was there all time, lurking at the other end of the parking lot, standing by a wall with the picture of a clown. I could notice that something was wrong right away.

“Hello, sir”, I said to the creep. “I’m officer Mitch, is everything alright?”

The creep didn’t answer. Actually, I didn’t know if he could hear me at all. The only moment he seemed to notice my presence, was when the light beam touched his face. The man looked like an old retard, with some kind of tumor in his skull. His entire head was bigger than his body, and there were long stains of saliva shinning on the chest of his gray Pepsi T-shirt. He was holding a metal hammer in his left hand, and there were tinny red dots on the metal surface. Maybe blood.

“Sir?”

I could see the anger in his little eyes, but his motion was far from aggressive. The creep was just standing there, looking at the light. His weird moan sent chills down my fucking spine. The man walked towards me, without any sign of lucid intention. He was wasted or just a retard, or both. I felt tempted to raise my gun, just in case, but I didn’t. When the guy was closer, I could notice his pale skin, and all the blue veins on his face, like worms swimming under a thin layer of milk. Most of his face features were blurred, and that retard just kept standing there, drooling and moaning with quiet anger.

Another disturbing fact, the guy never blinked. Not even once, and that was something, considering the beam of my flashlight was right in his ugly face.

I kept speaking to him, in vain. I felt a strange mix of feelings. At some point, I noticed the head of this guy was pulsating. I thought it was just my imagination, but it was true, his deformed skull was pulsating like a giant heart. His pale face got full with broad veins, and you could say for his expression that he was suffering. Dark blood leaked from his mouth and nostrils. And then, if everything that I just described before wasn’t enough, the mother-fucker jumped over me, and dropped me over my ass.

“Hey, you son of a bitch, get out!”

He was really fast. I couldn’t believe I was pushing his bulging and sweat soaked head with one hand, while punching his horrid face with the other. It was a sad and horrible scene to watch. Why I didn’t shot him? And worst (yes, this gets worst, believe it or not), the bastard grabbed one of my shoulders, trying to smash my head with the hammer and bite my hands. I was just waiting for the chance to grab my revolver and blow his fucking excuse of a head off, like a *piñata*. While this bizarre dance went on, I was moving my head side to side, in order to avoid the blows of his hammer, that kept swinging near my face and crashing down to the asphalt, making my poor right ear scream in pain. I grabbed the hand in which he had the hammer, and with my free hand I pushed his head, until I felt I was about to break his rotten neck.

“Get off me, mother-fucker! I said GET OFF!”

I don’t know how, I managed to move him aside and stand up. The junkie or whatever he was, screeched, and I have to admit I kicked his head, just in a burst of blind anger. Some of his bloody teeth flew through the air.

I grabbed my revolver and pulled the hammer back.

“Stay right where you are, you piece of shit!” I shouted, aiming the gun at him. “And don’t move a fucking muscle!”

Did I mention the guy was quick? He was on his feet in less than a second. I can’t remember if he used his hands or just jump-stood, like an Asian fighter in a kung-fu movie. The only thing I remember are his little angry eyes, staring at me with monstrous intention.

“Sir?” I said. “You heard me? I’m not joking. Step back and show me your hands.”

This… guy screamed at my face, and got into attack position. I shoot at the asphalt under his shoes, but he didn’t even blink. Then I realized that he wasn’t human at all. That I was dealing with something else, and not yelling or warning shots would change his mind even a little. Yeah, that was when I lost myself in desperation.

The bastard rushed again, his legs and arms moving frantic in the night air, when two bullets hit his face, and I could hear the wet sound they made when tearing the flesh. The bastard went on his knees, which snapped broken when they touched the floor. But he wasn’t over yet. He opened his mouth to scream again, opened wide and beyond any normal possibility, when another shot broke a big chunk of his skull, and he fell dead at my feet. Dead like a rock.

I was in shock, I admit it. It wasn’t me who shot. Behind me, smoking gun firm in her trembling hands, eyes nervously open, Linda was staring at the maniac she has just killed.

“Whou-whou-whou, what was that?” she gasped.

im in a long term relationship with my gf and we talk about our future a lot and i think owning a house would be the only thing i can see myself doing, but unfortunately i just can’t see myself being mature enough to get married (i don’t have many friends and don’t have a quality guy to be a best man so i’ve lead myself to believe that it wouldn’t be fun and therefore not worth it), and especially having kids, i need to improve myself in all different aspects before i even think about reproducing. 

and i literally just don’t even look like an adult, i feel like i wouldn’t even get taken seriously. i’m skinny, but not just no fat/no muscle skinny, it’s a skinny bone structure skinny. so my wrists and fingers look like that of a 13 year old girl. 

despite what i’ve said, i would consider myself mature, as in the way i act and handle relationships and conflicts, but i feel like i’ll never get over this bridge from being mature to truly emotionally mature enough to live a fulfilling life, not to mention i probably won’t ever look older than 19 to others.",3,1764876456.0,GuyCry,7,0.8,False

1pe999r,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1pe999r/histamine_what_helped_me/,Histamine what helped me ?,"I’m sharing my story here because I often feel stuck between several boxes: not “allergic enough” for some doctors, too “complicated” for others, and yet my body reacts to almost everything. My main problem today is a severe intolerance to histamine, on top of a severe MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome) and a gut damaged by treatments.

I’ll try to summarise my journey from the beginning to today, what I’ve tried, what helped me or made things worse, and where I currently stand, with a focus on histamine and the role of colostrum (I take 20 g per day).

1. My baseline

I was already careful with my lifestyle:

1. No alcohol
2. No smoking
3. No coffee
4. No tea
5. No drugs

So on paper, a “clean” lifestyle, but obviously a fragile digestive and immune terrain.

2. The trigger and the shift into histamine intolerance

The real turning point was taking ciprofloxacin in December 2024.

1. Gastric ulcers in spring 2025, severe pain, weight loss.

2. Introduction of “repair” peptides like BPC-157 which, in my case, violently reactivated inflammation and MCAS instead of soothing anything.

3. Taking 10 g of glutamine to “repair” the gut, which triggered hepatic encephalopathy with an ammonia crisis (head about to explode, confusion, feeling like I was dying).

4. A digestive system that was already fragile, on top of which a severe SIBO developed.

From that point on, my body started reacting to almost everything: foods, supplements, medications, sometimes even a single sip of a seemingly harmless food. Histamine intolerance became central in my daily life.

3. What histamine intolerance looks like for me, day to day

4. Extreme histamine intolerance

Reactions within 20 to 30 minutes after certain foods.
Itching, burning sensations, sometimes tachycardia, general malaise.
Unable to tolerate foods that are normally “healthy”: certain nuts, certain plant milks, some fermented products, reheated leftovers, etc.

2. Dependence on DAO (diamine oxidase)

Right now I have to take DAO with every meal, at a high dose, to avoid full-blown reactions.
Without DAO, even a small sip of a drink containing hazelnut or another “risky” food can trigger symptoms in less than 30 minutes.
This has been going on for more than 1 year. For now, DAO is an essential crutch.

3. Drug sensitivity

Many “standard” medications have become risky for me.
Some molecules trigger violent reactions (digestive, neurological, cardiac), even though they are supposedly “well tolerated” in most people.
Every new medication is evaluated as a potential bomb.

4. Gut and SIBO

Severe SIBO with abdominal pain, bloating, alternating diarrhoea and loose stools.
Each new supplement or dietary change can flare up digestive symptoms and, as a cascade, histamine intolerance and MCAS.

5. Brain and nervous system

Feeling like my brain is “inflamed”, difficulty coping with stress or sensory stimuli.
Constant hypervigilance toward my body’s reactions, which massively increases mental load.

4. What clearly made me worse

I’m not giving advice, just sharing what has been catastrophic for me personally.

1. Glutamine at 10 g

I took it to repair my gut.
Result: hepatic encephalopathy with a spike in ammonia, intracranial pressure sensation, confusion, emergency state.
Since then, I’m extremely cautious with anything that might increase ammonia or overload the liver.

2. BPC-157

A peptide often presented as a tissue and gut repair tool.
On my MCAS terrain with an inflamed gut, it was a major trigger of inflammatory and mast cell crises.
Bad timing, bad terrain, very bad experience.

3. Ornithine aspartate

Prescribed to help lower ammonia.
On me: worsening, intolerance, amplified symptoms.
I stopped it.

5. What has actually helped or stabilised me, with a focus on histamine and colostrum

I see several pillars.

1. Managing ammonia and the liver

OKG (ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate)
Where ornithine aspartate dragged me down, OKG was a real turning point. It helped me get out of the ammonia crisis. My brain gradually lost that constant “internal pressure” feeling.

Extreme caution with anything that overloads the liver
No alcohol.
No hepatotoxic drugs if I can avoid them.
No “aggressive” experiments without serious thought.

2. SIBO treatment

Rifaximin
Targeted SIBO treatment for several weeks, combined with other approaches.
It’s not a miracle cure, but it clearly improved my overall digestive terrain and reduced part of the symptoms.

Antimicrobial herbs (oregano, silver, etc.)
Used cautiously and in a supervised context.
Useful to reduce bacterial load, but must be handled carefully to avoid triggering even more MCAS and histamine intolerance.

3. Colostrum: 20 g per day

This is one of the pillars I use to work on the gut and, indirectly, on histamine.

I take colostrum standardised to 30% IgG as follows:
10 g in the morning before a meal
10 g in the evening before a meal
So 20 g per day in total.

Goals with colostrum in my case:
Support the intestinal mucosa.
Modulate immunity at the gut level.
Try to reduce, in the medium term, overall reactivity, including histamine intolerance.

It’s not “magic” or instant, but over time I’ve noticed:
A digestive terrain that is a bit less chaotic than at the very beginning.
A slight increase in the variety of foods I can tolerate compared to my most acute phase.

I remain cautious: I’m not saying colostrum cures histamine intolerance. But in my case, 20 g per day is part of the foundation that helps me not fall back into complete chaos.

4. Managing MCAS and histamine

High-dose DAO before each meal
Honestly, it’s what allowed me to keep eating.
I’m still dependent on it for now, but it gives me a minimum of breathing room in daily life.

And bilastine and ketotifene on crisis.

5. Tissue and immune repair

Peptides like GHK-Cu, KPV, Thymosin alpha-1 (in a supervised context)
Moderate positive effects on inflammation, recovery and the feeling of having a “damaged body everywhere”.
Nothing miraculous, but a slow and visible progression over several months.

6. Lifestyle and movement

Daily walking
30 minutes of walking per day on a treadmill.
Even on hard days, I try to keep a minimum of movement to avoid general deconditioning.

Protected sleep
Strict sleep hygiene.
Sometimes small doses of melatonin to reset my sleep cycle when everything goes off the rails.

6. Where I am today

I’m not in full remission, but I’m no longer in the absolute hell of the beginning.

What has improved:

1. I’m no longer in permanent hepatic encephalopathy.

2. My SIBO is less aggressive than at its worst.

3. My diet, though limited, is a bit more varied than when almost everything triggered me.

4. I can move a bit every day, whereas before I was almost pinned down by fatigue and reactions.

5. Some blood tests have become acceptable again (low inflammation, stabilised thyroid, etc.).

What is still very difficult:

1. I still have to take DAO with every meal, at high dose, more than 1 year later.

2. My liver is still fragile and I live with the fear of another ammonia crisis.

3. MCAS and histamine intolerance are still there, ready to flare up as soon as I step slightly out of line.

4. Every new medication, every new supplement is a game of Russian roulette.

5. Conclusion

In my case, histamine intolerance is not “a small digestion issue” or “just stress”, but the logical consequence of a terrain weakened by ciprofloxacin, a damaged gut, an overloaded liver and an immune system in hyperreactivity.

Even with a strict strategy, I can see that histamine still behaves unpredictably. On some days, with the exact same diet, I react much more. There are probably still poorly understood factors: autonomic nervous system, hormones, environmental factors, invisible micro-triggers.

For now, I see my histamine system and mast cells as a protection system that has become paranoid: it detects threats everywhere because it has been bombarded with infectious, drug-related and toxic insults.

My current battle plan is to:

1. Reduce the load on the liver and gut as much as possible.

2. Keep treating SIBO and intestinal permeability gradually.

3. Soothe the nervous system and stabilise sleep.

4. Keep DAO as a crutch for as long as necessary.

5. Keep colostrum at 20 g per day as a background support for the gut and immunity.

6. Why I’m posting here and what I’m looking for

I’m posting here because I know many people are going through the same thing:

Reacting to everything and not feeling taken seriously.
Being told that “everything is fine” because standard tests are normal.
Being forced to become an expert of your own body just to survive daily life.

What I’m especially interested in is feedback from people who:

1. Have had severe histamine intolerance, possibly with MCAS, triggered or worsened by a digestive issue (SIBO, intestinal permeability, infection, antibiotics, etc.).

2. Have been dependent on DAO for months or years and managed to lower the dose or stop it.

3. Have found concrete strategies (natural, pharmaceutical or other) that genuinely reduced histamine reactivity over 6 to 12 months.

4. Use or have used colostrum at doses close to 20 g per day and noticed an impact on the gut, immunity and food tolerance.

I’d really like to hear about:

Protocols that worked for you in the medium and long term.
Mistakes that caused relapses.
How you navigated things with doctors (allergists, internists, gastroenterologists, etc.).

Thank you to anyone who reads this to the end. We don’t choose to have severe histamine intolerance, but we can at least try not to go through it completely alone 💕🦋",4,1764876331.0,HistamineIntolerance,4,0.84,False

Here’s a sample of what my longer replies can look like to give you an idea of what to expect. No pressure if you don’t have any samples 

———

Norna didn’t speak for while as she followed Lucifer she just couldn’t, she temporarily lost that ability for a bit she was so flustered. 
She looked over at the altar curiously,she couldn’t help but notice and love that it held some similarities to the ones she has for her own gods back home. With the fair linen that was spread neatly over it and a nice display of candles on it.She looked up at the perfect rows of endless pews in front of them in the chancel before slowly turning to look around entirely. Just marvelling over its old and meticulously detailed statues that surrounded them and the beautifully crafted stained glass that left a kaleidoscope of colour on the walls, illuminated by the sun. This place was unlike anything she had ever set foot in on Midgard,even she could sense an ethereal presence here that can’t be overlooked. How people who’ve never been to been to heaven managed to captured a glimpse of it from merely a book and passion is incredible. But it’s a great passion even she can relate towards her gods. It’s crazy and kinda sad that the list of similarities grew between the two practices yet they’re still worlds apart.When she finally faced Lucifer her face went bright red, her eyes again taking in his appearance.Blissfully bringing her back to reality, she smiled shyly, he’s just too gorgeous for his own good. While still giddy over the nickname at least she had enough time to find her voice again“It’s really pretty” she said, almost begrudgingly. She hated to say it, but it’s the truth, this place is truly breathtaking. The whole cathedral is an entire altar of art.

And here is my more shorter and common response.

————-

Tony laughed “Can’t tell you that! It’s supposed to be secret” he teased, the corners of his mouth curling with a mischievous charming smirk. If only Ava knew. He’s the furthest from working with the FEDS. He’s their worst nightmare. A phantom in a tailored suit, who basically has the city lassoed in a chain made of his threats and bloodstained promises. The kind of man whispered about in precincts, like a monster parents scare their kids straight with “So what’s new with you?” He asked, trying to steer the subject away from his work.

Hopefully these replies are okay with you.

And we certainly do **NOT** have to do them if you don’t want they’re merely suggestions. If you have any of your own please share away

**End of 2025.**  
My coffee is older than some of your Git repos, I haven’t seen sunlight since the Steam Summer Sale, and I just shipped a **fully playable cyberpunk RPG slice** that used to take me **4–6 months** of pure suffering.

This time?  
**18 days.**  
That’s less time than it takes me to decide on a variable name.

Behold: the thumbnail I made while waiting for my instant noodles (10 min Meshy + 2 min Photoshop). Still hotter than my code in 2012.

\[IMAGE 1:1 – Neon samurai getting auto-rigged by robot arms while Unity/Unreal/Godot logos party in the background like it’s 1999 and they just discovered shaders\]

**My “I Replaced My Soul with API Credits” 2026 Workflow (written by a man who still names his test projects “TestProject\_Final\_Final\_v2\_REAL”)**

1. **Ideation →** [**Ludo.ai**](http://Ludo.ai) Typed “cyberpunk RPG but your karma literally rewires the city” → Got 7 full pitch decks faster than my old brain could open Google Docs. Chose one, cried a single tear of joy, hit export.
2. **Art direction → Midjourney v6.2 + my style model** Trained it on my ancient portfolio (yes, the one with comic sans splash screens). Now everything looks cohesive instead of “I let my cousin do the art.”
3. **3D models →** [**Meshy.ai**](http://Meshy.ai) **+ Luma Dream Machine** “Scary neon alley with questionable life choices” → fully rigged hideout in 8 minutes. My 2015 self would have sacrificed a goat to Blender for this.
4. **Procedural levels → Houdini + ComfyUI + Unity ML-Agents** Prompt: “rainy streets that hate parkour gods” → City now passively-aggressively rearranges itself when you’re too good. Finally, revenge against speedrunners.
5. **Code that doesn’t make baby Jesus weep → Claude 4 Opus +** [**Cursor.sh**](http://Cursor.sh) I write: fix this spaghetti AI returns clean, commented, Series-S-optimized code and a passive-aggressive comment: // please never do this again Grok-3 still names variables playerIsBrokeAF and I respect it.
6. **NPCs with zero chill → Llama 3.1 405B + ElevenLabs v4** Bartender looked at a guy carrying 47 energy drinks and went: “Rough day at the call center, corporate drone?” I haven’t laughed this hard since someone tried to use Flash in 2023.
7. **Animation → Cascadeur AI + Runway Gen-3** Recorded myself flailing in underwear at 3 AM → 4 minutes later my samurai has smoother moves than my social skills. Physics-based combat now feels heavier than my student loans.
8. **Polish → Topaz Video AI + Magnific** My 2K trailer now looks like Cyberpunk 2077’s marketing team owes me money.

**Stats for the fellow boomers**  
Old timeline: 5 months of crying in the dark  
New timeline: **18 days** of “wait… is this allowed?”  
Playtester quote: “Bro how many people work with you?”  
Me, sipping 3-day-old coffee: “Just me and my robot children.”

**TL;DR**  
AI didn’t steal my job.  
It just fired the part of my job that made me consider a career in accounting.

Who else is already married to their AI co-pilot in 2026?

We still have Friday left. I’ve been in the coffee world for many years, but I still have doubts about this topic. If I use water that has already been boiled before, does it affect the taste of the coffee? Does it affect the flavor of the cup?

I’ve been searching to see if there’s any scientific indication or any research where someone gave a clear and definitive answer yes or no.

For example, just to make things clearer: I currently use Lotus drops . I put 900 ml of water in the kettle, and during one brewing session, I might boil the same water twice. While I prepare my setup and everything, the temperature drops, so I boil it again to bring it up to temperature. I always brew at 95°C because I mostly work with light roasts.

The 900 ml usually gives me about two cups, so we can say during those two cups the water might be boiled 4 or 5 times. So I’m wondering, does this actually have an effect? Because usually, if the water gets boiled more than twice, the taste of the cup starts to change — but I don’t know if I’m imagining it or if someone else experiences the same thing.

So I’m looking for a real answer, guys. Especially about this topic. And I hope if anyone has solid knowledge about this, they can help me out.",4,1764875894.0,pourover,10,0.83,False

Here’s a sample of what my longer replies can look like to give you an idea of what to expect. No pressure if you don’t have any samples

Norna didn’t speak for while as she followed Lucifer she just couldn’t, she temporarily lost that ability for a bit she was so flustered. 
She looked over at the altar curiously,she couldn’t help but notice and love that it held some similarities to the ones she has for her own gods back home. With the fair linen that was spread neatly over it and a nice display of candles on it.She looked up at the perfect rows of endless pews in front of them in the chancel before slowly turning to look around entirely. Just marvelling over its old and meticulously detailed statues that surrounded them and the beautifully crafted stained glass that left a kaleidoscope of colour on the walls, illuminated by the sun. This place was unlike anything she had ever set foot in on Midgard,even she could sense an ethereal presence here that can’t be overlooked. How people who’ve never been to been to heaven managed to captured a glimpse of it from merely a book and passion is incredible. But it’s a great passion even she can relate towards her gods. It’s crazy and kinda sad that the list of similarities grew between the two practices yet they’re still worlds apart.When she finally faced Lucifer her face went bright red, her eyes again taking in his appearance.Blissfully bringing her back to reality, she smiled shyly, he’s just too gorgeous for his own good. While still giddy over the nickname at least she had enough time to find her voice again“It’s really pretty” she said, almost begrudgingly. She hated to say it, but it’s the truth, this place is truly breathtaking. The whole cathedral is an entire altar of art.

And here is my more shorter and common response.

————-

Tony laughed “Can’t tell you that! It’s supposed to be secret” he teased, the corners of his mouth curling with a mischievous charming smirk. If only Ava knew. He’s the furthest from working with the FEDS. He’s their worst nightmare. A phantom in a tailored suit, who basically has the city lassoed in a chain made of his threats and bloodstained promises. The kind of man whispered about in precincts, like a monster parents scare their kids straight with “So what’s new with you?” He asked, trying to steer the subject away from his work.

Hopefully these replies are okay with you.

These are my plot suggestions. Most of these are not set in stone what AU/time period they take place, we can tweak them however much you want I’m always open for new ideas. And we certainly do **NOT** have to do them if you don’t want they’re merely suggestions. If you have any of your own please share away

For the first few days it felt manageable and I could still do things and go to places. All of a sudden after 3 days, I was sitting in a coffee shop and felt extremely faint and from there, it was a downward spiral. It seemed to quickly turn into a sinus type infection - extreme fatigue, a lot of pain in my face and toothache, plus more snot and mucus than I’ve ever had in my life, often bright yellow or brown and bloody. (I’m also not prone to sinus issues). I’m now on my 8th day in bed and still feeling pretty awful. Now it seems to have transitioned into a very mucas like chesty cough that is keeping me up. Doc gave me antibiotics which seems to have helped the sinuses but nothing else. They did say antibiotics might not work that well as it’s hard to tell what kind of virus this is. I’ve not been knocked out for this long for a very long time. Anyone else had anything similar? Or can suggest how to actually kick this? (It’s not Covid btw, tested twice and it came back negative).

Starting with 1,000 local worms I’m hoping are all red worms.
Have the same bins in the ‘main menu thread’ with 7” depth to put on a (metal) wire rack like you’d see in (the back of) a restaurant.


There’s enough (raw) cardboard shredded as fine as you can shred it (micro? less than 2”).
Maybe 10-20lbs already shredded.

-Super thankful for the Wolverine and Staples 16page.-


It’s sweet potato, onion, broccoli stalk, and coffee grounds ready to go - in miniscule quantities so I don’t run into issues instantly. 
Also egg and just shells.
Frozen so I don’t have to think about it till worms land.

Things I’d like to add to it are seafood (maybe in the form of kelpmeal) for flare,
and this malted barley mix that has very high ratings.
It’s a mix of malted barley, sprouted lentil seed, and sprouted heirloom corn… all non GMO and from someone I trust.
That is to be grounded into a powder to prevent any un-sprouted seeds from sprouting in the bin, unexpectedly.
There’s definitely some interest in mycological diversity as well as molasses - molasses seems to be common.
Studying fermentation.


WHEN’s the best to add those listed above?
After one starts simple with just the cardboard, very light food scraps, and maybe egg carton for aesthetics.
But right after that, or maybe when the worms are to size?
Not looking to freak them out right away… or do they like that?

Is there a consensus on lids (or blankets, or lights) to use, in dry, mild, and humid, hot/cold conditions? 
For keeping worms in the bin + conditions right.

How many worms should one expect to fit in a bin 20” long, 16” wide, 7” tall? 
Was it about 250?


Thank you very kindly this has been quite the planning (fun!)

He insists he’s been initiating, but when he’s short with me or irritated from work, I shut down emotionally and don’t feel connected. It’s gone on a little too long and now it feels swept under the rug. I am upset because it’s all my fault he feels like I need to figure out what’s wrong with me. Our sex life has never been overly frequent, but we used to have other forms of intimacy that made me feel close to him. Now he says he doesn’t feel wanted, and honestly, I don’t either. I try to show love through little daily things, but I don’t feel that same effort from him. I make his coffee and go out of my way to buy him things he likes. It just feels like he’s done trying. He seems uninterested in my hobbies—when I come home excited to share something, he acts annoyed or dismissive. Maybe I do talk about it too much, but I’m still interested in the things he talks about. I don’t know I felt like if you love someone wouldn’t you be somewhat interested? When we talk about these issues, he shuts down quickly, says “okay, we’re good,” and moves on without actually addressing anything. I know he’s stressed from work and I have been too, but it just feels so disconnected.There’s no vulnerability or willingness to meet halfway, and it leaves me feeling unheard and stuck. I don’t know where to go from here when he refuses therapy and doesn’t seem willing to have deeper conversations. We did have a nice calm conversation but still feels one sided and he’s ready to move on where these things linger for me and doesn’t feel resolved. I would honestly do anything to fix it, but I can’t be the only one being vulnerable. Then he doesn’t feel like doing family obligations because he doesn’t like doing them with his family, but then I always feel like a burden if I ask him to go to my niece’s graduation. Then I feel weird going without him… ( I barely have any family functions outside of Thanksgiving and Christmas) We’ve been married for 1.5 years and together for 6 years. I’m going to talk to my therapist tomorrow so I’m hoping that gives me some clarity. Also I asked him to talk to his therapist about it and he won’t… so I’m confused by this. He says it’s none of my business what they talk about, it isn’t…But if he loves me isn’t it worth trying to fix? I don’t need details but it would be nice to know if he was trying to work on it. Any advice? 

tl;dr
Husband refuses counseling, blames me for our sex life, and shuts down when I try to talk. I feel unwanted and unheard, and he doesn’t meet me halfway emotionally or show interest in my life.

I’m looking for something that starts online and builds into genuine connection; conversation, chemistry, maybe some escapism. Not looking to upend anyone’s life, but I do want something that feels real, not transactional.

Me: 40, tall and bearded. I’m the guy who’ll stay up too late debating fantasy magic systems, send you a perfectly timed meme at 2am, or get genuinely invested in whatever you’re passionate about. People tell me I’m easy to talk to, probably because I actually listen and remember the random things you mention. I think what people respond to is that I’m genuinely interested in them- not just waiting for my turn to talk.

I’m curious, a little nerdy (okay, a lot nerdy), and I genuinely enjoy when people light up talking about what matters to them. I also drink ridiculously sugary coffee drinks and I’m completely shameless about it. At the end of the day, I’m just a guy trying his best.

You: someone who wants real conversation and chemistry. Ideally in the DMV area (DC, Northern Virginia, south of Baltimore) because local context matters, but I’m open if we really click. Online to start, respectful of boundaries and discretion, comfortable with photos when it feels right.

How do I handle this without blowing things up?,"My mom (75F) and I (50F) are low contact by my choice due to childhood trauma. I’m in therapy and not ready to talk through my childhood with her yet, despite her pushing for that conversation. For now, we text once a day. She initiates with minutiae about her day, I answer with mine. It’s basically a proof-of-life check-in - and this is more than enough for me. I don't even talk to my own adult children daily and we have very healthy relationships!

She is extremely passive-aggressive and avoids direct communication. Instead of asking for coffee at my house, she’ll say something like, “Oh, I haven’t had coffee today… that’s probably why my head hurts,” and just wait, staring at me. She also compares herself to others in a way that feels like guilt-tripping because we don't do the same things for her that Wanda's daughters do for Wanda. On top of that, when she wants something, she often uses a babyish, childlike voice that feels manipulative and honestly really triggering for me.

Another big issue is triangulation. She constantly talks to my sister about me and to me about my sister. This caused real damage to my relationship with my sister over the years, and we’ve worked very hard to repair it. We have both clearly told our mom to stop doing this. She hasn’t.

Gift-giving is also a long-standing problem. She sends very specific lists and gets upset if they’re not followed exactly. In the past, when I tried giving thoughtful off-list gifts (jewellery, books, travel items), I later found out she returned them. Because of that, I now only ask for one gift idea and stick to a set budget.

This year at Thanksgiving, I mentioned that money was tighter due to unexpected expenses and that parent gifts would be around $50. She made a face, looked at my sister, and said, “Didn’t she just go on a trip?” My husband overheard that comment and told me afterward. Since then, I haven’t asked her what she wants for Christmas at all.

Yesterday, my sister told me that my mom asked her to tell me to buy her a $200 vacuum sealer for Christmas.

I feel stuck. She didn’t ask me directly. She went through my sister despite being told not to. The item she wants is far outside the budget I already stated. If I buy a cheaper version, I know she’ll be upset that it’s not “the right one.” And if I call her, I expect the baby voice, the passive-aggression, and the emotional pressure to kick right in**,** and I’m honestly worried I’ll lose my cool.

What is the healthiest, lowest-drama way to handle this without rewarding the triangulation or blowing up the holiday?  I am dealing with a very heavy workload at work and I am also an executive who is facing having to cut staff. I am helping care for my dad and stepmom who are both ill. My own kids, while amazing, still need me to guide, support and listen to them (there are SIX of them). I am BURNT out - thank God for my husband, who is getting an amazing gift this year LOL.

While there he was really nice and was literally giving me ‘princess treatment’ and even offered to drive me home afterwards. Which gave me the impression that he might actually like me as more than a friend.

Then, the next day, Monday, I texten him: “It was really fun yesterday😊. Are you busy tomorrow evening?”. 
To which he replied: “Yeah, unfortunately”. And I replied: “Okey shame, see you Wednesday”. 
Because we usually hang out with our friend group every Wednesday and on Sunday he had mentioned that he was coming Wednesday. 

When Wednesday rolls around he takes a long time to show up and when he does get there he only stays for like half an hour, which is fine, I was just a bit disappointed that he didn’t stay longer. I didn’t comment on it though since we barely spoke at all that day.

But the thing is since Monday I haven’t sent him anything else except the usual snapchat picture once a day. 
And before, we have both sent face pics. But this week he has only sent me pictures from when he’s at work (so not face pics). And now today he hasn’t sent me anything, which kinda makes me think that he might have realized that I like him and he doesn’t like me back and is now trying to avoid/ignore me.

Lucy Oren Von Emerson doesn’t just know–she knows better. With answers to questions that have yet to be asked, she is the eldest daughter, both compass and magnetic north.

But the world shifts. For a decade, she was a driven writer, finally nearing her long-awaited break and leading by example for her two little sisters, Lola and Libby. Then a call from her weblog editor ends, taking her contract renewal with it. The career that funded her humble single-income-no-kids lifestyle vanishes like steam off a poorly poured cup of coffee. Lucy must begin again. But that can’t mean starting over. Afterall, she *is* the eldest sister. If she goes back to the start, won’t she pull her sisters with her?

So when her charismatic father, the one who never supported her writing, asks after her, she knows, Lucy *knows*, that this next answer will need proof. She gathers her sisters, all for Mr. Von Emerson to make one final, theatrical request of them before he retires: go out, *find love*. 

For most people, that’s difficult. For the Von Emerson sisters, it’s a confrontation.

Libby, the youngest and heiress to the family business, insists they take the task international. Lola, the middle child with a soft heart and a talent for disaster, still remembers when family meant falling… together. Contracts now allowing, and old wounds resurfacing, Lucy sets off with her sisters on their very own world tour, intending, if not to find the right answer, then to *make* her answer right. Even if it means facing the love she lost.

Reminiscent of *Black Girls Must Die Exhausted* by Jayne Allen and *The Most Fun We Ever Had* by Claire Lombardo, *What Would LOVE Do?* is an upmarket, voice-driven novel, sitting at 115,000 words, about three sisters chasing connection, chaos, and occasionally each other around the kitchen island.

As one part of a sister trio myself, I write this like lipstick on a three-sided mirror. Please, trust me to deliver a delightfully biased take on sisterhood and the messy, beautiful, questionable journey of finding oneself in one another.

Thank you for your consideration,

Another week another review. New week new brand. Finally, I got chance to review elusive brand Penon. Long story short another opportunity presented by AudioGeek India review tour. They had Penon Voltage on tour, and I had requested for to be included in review tour. I was bidding days after days and finally one morning I got message that it was coming towards me. I was bit sceptical how it would be what to expect etc. Well, all my thoughts and opinions have gone for toss out of the window. What are my thoughts now after some time with this set please read on.

First of all, let me thank AudioGeek India for giving me opportunity to review tis set. Special thanks to man behind AudioGeek family Sandeep bhai. Also mighty thanks to Penon for review tour.

I was not paid or given any kind of compensation for this review. This review is my thoughts and opinions about this set.

My biases well I like DD sets over Hybrids and Planars. Also keep in mind my music choices listed in the music genre section. Keep both in mind while reading my review.

Now that all the pleasantries are done. Let’s get on with the meat and potatoes of this review.


Build Quality:

I received set with only 2 cables and iems. Nothing more nothing less. Well, the iems are made up of resin. One that looks really good quality. Iems are bit big in size. Iem nozzles are long providing deep fit. Nozzles don’t have lip so ear tips might slip off. Nozzles have no filters so need to take care so that they don’t clog up. Shell has two tuning switches, and one pressure adjust vent if I am not wrong.

Provided both cables one Penon OSS cable and another one both are premium one. They scream premium. I liked both. There was no sonic difference. But for entire review I have used the non-stock cable. Both cables are multicore ones with metal terminations and chin synch plus separator. Both are terminated in 0.78 mm and 4.4 mm. None of them is modular.

Overall Build Quality 5/5

  

Comfort & Fit:

Shells are big but fit my ears well. Well I have elephant ears everything fits me. Small ear people beware. Check before purchase. Nozzles are lip less yet I had no slip offs. Shells don’t cause any pain or weird fatigue issues in my ears.

Cables are supple and non-microphonic. Chin synch work stays in place. Roadie wrapping them is easy.

Overall Comfort & Fit 5/5



Configuration:

4 sonion ESTs + 4 Sonion BAs + 2 8 mm Dynamic drivers. 4-way crossover. 13 ohms impedance. 106dB sensitivity. Frequency response range 5Hz-70KHz.



Music Genre Used for this Review:

Hip-hop/EDM/Rap/Rock both classic and hard/Bollywood Music/Pop/Jazz/Regional music etc.

5. EPZ TP50
6. Onix alpha xi 1
7. Cayin RU6

This iem is very efficient (106dB) as when I used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive this iem with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So iem is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU6, onix alpha xi 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze.

Sources scaling Tempotec v3 blaze > Cayin RU7> Onix Alpha xi 1 > Cayin Ru6 > EPZ TP50 > Fiio KA13 > Moondrop Dawn pro > Fiio KA3> Jcally jm6

It was really exceptional musical experience with Cayin Ru6 yet I have not based my entire review on its impressions & have used impressions from other sources as Cayin Ru6 colours presentation &not everyone likes it.

So, I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn’t like presentation with bright sources.



Ear tips :

I used variety of ear tips to test the iems from small bore to wide bore and exotic ear tips. Best pairing that I found was with Penon orange liquer ear tips for me.



Sound Impressions:

Bass/ Lows:

Sub bass rumbles. It has physical feel to it. Yet it does not overshadow. It is quick decay one. Mid bass slaps. It also is physical; you can feel and hear it. Drums, kick drums are fantastic. Their tone & timbre feels natural. Guitars feel natural with right amount of reverberations. Piano notes are excellent. Bass is not for bass heads. For others it is perfect.

Overall Bass/Lows 5/5
 

Mids:

Male and female vocals both shines here. Female vocals are to die for. They can get bit intense but perfect for me. You can hear voice modulations in vocals. Technically vocals are bit recessed here. Yet I would call it done perfectly. Hence, they don’t get shouty. Instruments in the mids are well represented. You can see that they are not smeared or congested.

Overall Mids 5/5



Treble/Highs:

nicely tuned in the treble region. No shrillness or harshness. You can enjoy at high volumes also.
Nice extension in air region. Wide soundstage and tall in height. Soundstage feels truly holographic. A closer to open out of head feeling soundstage. No instrument smearing or congestion. All are spread out evenly. You can spot them individually in mix. Positional queue are great. All macro and micro details are well presented. You will not miss any detail in the mix. Crashes, cymbals, flutes sound natural. One of the best treble tunings heard in long time.

Overall Treble/Highs 5/5



Song Impressions:

Angel by Massive Attack

Started droning of the sub bass can be heard and felt. This entire song has continuous sub bass droning you can feel it and hear it. It is on point. Vocals are as it should be. Neither front nor back. Drumbeats are on point. Shakers feel well represented Guitars are on point. You can feel the strings being stringed. crashes are on point. Entire mix doesn’t get congested or smeared. Mix sounds precise. Overall great reproduction.

Guitars are on point. String reverberations are on point. Guitars are central to this song and they are exceptional. Crashes sound natural. Drum strike and their reverberations are on point and natural. Mid bass impact is great it’s just in perfect amount. No smearing or congestion is felt. Drivers easily handle this complex song. This song can get intense depending on tuning. But here it doesn’t get intense. I thoroughly enjoyed the reproduction here. Excellent reproduction.

Sway by Diana Krall

I am fan of Diana krall. Diana krall sounds sensual in this song. This set does justice to her voice. She sounds the way I remember she should. You can hear the pitch changes in the voice of her. The Background score is there to support her voice and create harmony. Here it does create that harmony. Nothing sounds out of place or pointed, It all blends nicely to create atmosphere that makes this song classic. Overall phenomenal reproduction.

Fly me to moon by Frank Sinatra
One of the classics by frank Sinatra. Here the music doesn’t overshadow vocals. His distinct vocals (light baritones) sound proper. It is always pleasured to listen to his voice. Drums trumpets, strings you name it all instrument shine here. There is no smearing or congestion. Entire mix flows as it should. I really was mesmerized by the song. Exceptional Reproduction.



Final Conclusion:

Penon Voltage is my first ever penon set and an EST one. Never had experienced EST set. Let me tell you I have become EST fan. One of the best treble I have ever heard. No shrillness or artificialness. Penon's choice of drivers is excellent. Anything I threw at it sounded great. Bass is just perfect. Mids are perfect Treble here is like icing on cake. Just perfect. Never had dull moment while listening. Enjoyed all my genres. Had to really listen with intent to find faults. As it was really hard for me. I can safely say that I have found my number 1 set around 1k.  This set and UM stardust are my go-to best and beloved sets at this price point. I can recommend these two sets eyes closed to anyone.

I had skepticism that this set might be forward in one or two aspects but to my astonishment it is tuned perfectly with proper emphasis in right places. This set speaks to me feels like it was made for me. Penon has done amazing job tuning it. I think I have shilled it beyond the need but let me remind you, I am speaking about it so much as I have truly fallen in love with it. You can see that throughout this review, I hope.

I have written the title as Penon Voltage a Musical Jolt & yes, it is. I can swear by it, and I implore you to listen to it yourself to truly understand it. Now let’s wrap up. I have put you through a lot.

Thank you for enduring with me till end. Now go grab cup of Hot coffee and let’s listen to safe high that is Music.

Drum strike and their reverberations are on point and natural. Mid bass impact is great it’s just in perfect amount. No smearing or congestion is felt. Drivers easily handle this complex song. This song can get intense depending on tuning. But here it doesn’t get intense. I thoroughly enjoyed the reproduction here. Excellent reproduction.

Sway by Diana Krall

I am fan of Diana krall. Diana krall sounds sensual in this song. This set does justice to her voice. She sounds the way I remember she should. You can hear the pitch changes in the voice of her. The Background score is there to support her voice and create harmony. Here it does create that harmony. Nothing sounds out of place or pointed, It all blends nicely to create atmosphere that makes this song classic. Overall phenomenal reproduction.

Fly me to moon by Frank Sinatra
One of the classics by frank Sinatra. Here the music doesn’t overshadow vocals. His distinct vocals (light baritones) sound proper. It is always pleasured to listen to his voice. Drums trumpets, strings you name it all instrument shine here. There is no smearing or congestion. Entire mix flows as it should. I really was mesmerized by the song. Exceptional Reproduction.



Final Conclusion:

Penon Voltage is my first ever penon set and an EST one. Never had experienced EST set. Let me tell you I have become EST fan. One of the best treble I have ever heard. No shrillness or artificialness. Penon's choice of drivers is excellent. Anything I threw at it sounded great. Bass is just perfect. Mids are perfect Treble here is like icing on cake. Just perfect. Never had dull moment while listening. Enjoyed all my genres. Had to really listen with intent to find faults. As it was really hard for me. I can safely say that I have found my number 1 set around 1k.  This set and UM stardust are my go-to best and beloved sets at this price point. I can recommend these two sets eyes closed to anyone.

I had skepticism that this set might be forward in one or two aspects but to my astonishment it is tuned perfectly with proper emphasis in right places. This set speaks to me feels like it was made for me. Penon has done amazing job tuning it. I think I have shilled it beyond the need but let me remind you, I am speaking about it so much as I have truly fallen in love with it. You can see that throughout this review, I hope.

I have written the title as Penon Voltage a Musical Jolt & yes, it is. I can swear by it, and I implore you to listen to it yourself to truly understand it. Now let’s wrap up. I have put you through a lot.

Thank you for enduring with me till end. Now go grab cup of Hot coffee and let’s listen to safe high that is Music.

There’s a girl in my friend group I think is pretty and I’ve liked for a while. We’re not close, but we end up at the same group regularly. More of a friend of a good friend of mine. She’s always polite and friendly to me, but not in any special way. I’ve been trying to figure out if there’s anything there or if I’m reading too much into small moments.

A couple months ago, I asked if she wanted to grab coffee sometime. She said something like “Sorry my schedule is kind of packed right now.” She didn’t seem annoyed and it sounded believable. I took the hint and backed off.

A few weeks later at our pub we were talking about her stress at work and I said “We could go for a walk or something right now that may help against your stress.” She smiled and said she prefered to have a drink and chill. She wasn’t rude about it.

Since then I’ve tried to just be normal around her. We’ll talk a bit when we’re in the group, but she doesn’t go out of her way to keep the conversation going. She’ll answer questions if I ask but it usually stops there; also online. She’s not cold but just neutral.

The thing that’s confusing me is that she does seem comfortable around me in group settings. She laughs at things I say etc. Again she never acted weird or uncomfortable.

Last weekend a few of us were making plans for a beer festival. She mentioned she might go and I asked if she wanted to meet there. Then she said she was already planning to go with someone. I said no problem. But in my head I was confused because earlier she said she might go, not that she already had a concrete plan.

One of my friends told me I should take the hint but another said I shouldn’t assume she’s uninterested just because she’s busy or standoffish. I don’t want to make things awkward in the group. I also don’t want to assume she’s uninterested if she’s just shy or used to being approached a lot. I’m not planning on making her fee awkward. I just keep wondering if I should try one more time, but be very clear. Something like asking her for a coffee date with the two of us alone. And then never bring it up again if she says no.

I guess I’m struggling because she’s never been rude. She’s nice in groups, responds when I talk to her, never seems bothered by me being around… but she also never makes any effort to engage beyond that. Do I try one more time to be certain, or just accept that if she wanted it, I probably wouldn’t be confused right now? Any advice would help. I’m trying not to be “that guy.”",3,1764874962.0,bodylanguage,25,0.64,False

Another week another review. New week new brand. Finally, I got chance to review elusive brand Penon. Long story short another opportunity presented by AudioGeek India review tour. They had Penon Voltage on tour, and I had requested for to be included in review tour. I was bidding days after days and finally one morning I got message that it was coming towards me. I was bit sceptical how it would be what to expect etc. Well, all my thoughts and opinions have gone for toss out of the window. What are my thoughts now after some time with this set please read on.

First of all, let me thank AudioGeek India for giving me opportunity to review tis set. Special thanks to man behind AudioGeek family Sandeep bhai. Also mighty thanks to Penon for review tour.

I was not paid or given any kind of compensation for this review. This review is my thoughts and opinions about this set.

My biases well I like DD sets over Hybrids and Planars. Also keep in mind my music choices listed in the music genre section. Keep both in mind while reading my review.

Now that all the pleasantries are done. Let’s get on with the meat and potatoes of this review.


Build Quality:

I received set with only 2 cables and iems. Nothing more nothing less. Well, the iems are made up of resin. One that looks really good quality. Iems are bit big in size. Iem nozzles are long providing deep fit. Nozzles don’t have lip so ear tips might slip off. Nozzles have no filters so need to take care so that they don’t clog up. Shell has two tuning switches, and one pressure adjust vent if I am not wrong.

Provided both cables one Penon OSS cable and another one both are premium one. They scream premium. I liked both. There was no sonic difference. But for entire review I have used the non-stock cable. Both cables are multicore ones with metal terminations and chin synch plus separator. Both are terminated in 0.78 mm and 4.4 mm. None of them is modular.

Overall Build Quality 5/5

  

Comfort & Fit:

Shells are big but fit my ears well. Well I have elephant ears everything fits me. Small ear people beware. Check before purchase. Nozzles are lip less yet I had no slip offs. Shells don’t cause any pain or weird fatigue issues in my ears.

Cables are supple and non-microphonic. Chin synch work stays in place. Roadie wrapping them is easy.

Overall Comfort & Fit 5/5



Configuration:

4 sonion ESTs + 4 Sonion BAs + 2 8 mm Dynamic drivers. 4-way crossover. 13 ohms impedance. 106dB sensitivity. Frequency response range 5Hz-70KHz.

4. Fiio KA13
5. EPZ TP50
6. Onix alpha xi 1
7. Cayin RU6
8. Cayin RU7
9. Tempotec V3 Blaze

This iem is very efficient (106dB) as when I used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive this iem with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So iem is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU6, onix alpha xi 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze.

Sources scaling Tempotec v3 blaze > Cayin RU7> Onix Alpha xi 1 > Cayin Ru6 > EPZ TP50 > Fiio KA13 > Moondrop Dawn pro > Fiio KA3> Jcally jm6

It was really exceptional musical experience with Cayin Ru6 yet I have not based my entire review on its impressions & have used impressions from other sources as Cayin Ru6 colours presentation &not everyone likes it.

So, I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn’t like presentation with bright sources.



Ear tips :

I used variety of ear tips to test the iems from small bore to wide bore and exotic ear tips. Best pairing that I found was with Penon orange liquer ear tips for me.



Sound Impressions:

Bass/ Lows:

Sub bass rumbles. It has physical feel to it. Yet it does not overshadow. It is quick decay one. Mid bass slaps. It also is physical; you can feel and hear it. Drums, kick drums are fantastic. Their tone & timbre feels natural. Guitars feel natural with right amount of reverberations. Piano notes are excellent. Bass is not for bass heads. For others it is perfect.

Overall Bass/Lows 5/5
 

Mids:

Male and female vocals both shines here. Female vocals are to die for. They can get bit intense but perfect for me. You can hear voice modulations in vocals. Technically vocals are bit recessed here. Yet I would call it done perfectly. Hence, they don’t get shouty. Instruments in the mids are well represented. You can see that they are not smeared or congested.

Overall Mids 5/5



Treble/Highs:

nicely tuned in the treble region. No shrillness or harshness. You can enjoy at high volumes also.
Nice extension in air region. Wide soundstage and tall in height. Soundstage feels truly holographic. A closer to open out of head feeling soundstage. No instrument smearing or congestion. All are spread out evenly. You can spot them individually in mix. Positional queue are great. All macro and micro details are well presented. You will not miss any detail in the mix. Crashes, cymbals, flutes sound natural. One of the best treble tunings heard in long time.

Overall Treble/Highs 5/5



Song Impressions:

Angel by Massive Attack

Started droning of the sub bass can be heard and felt. This entire song has continuous sub bass droning you can feel it and hear it. It is on point. Vocals are as it should be. Neither front nor back. Drumbeats are on point. Shakers feel well represented Guitars are on point. You can feel the strings being stringed. crashes are on point. Entire mix doesn’t get congested or smeared. Mix sounds precise. Overall great reproduction.

1pe8md0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1pe8md0/mcas_story_since_one_year/,MCAS Story since one year,"I’m sharing my story here because I often feel stuck between several boxes: not “allergic enough” for some doctors, too “complicated” for others, and yet my body reacts to almost everything. I live with severe MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome), extreme histamine intolerance, and a gut that has been damaged by treatments.

I will try to summarise my journey from the beginning to today, what I have tried, what helped me or on the contrary harmed me, and where I concretely stand now.

1. My baseline terrain



I was already careful with my lifestyle: no alcohol, no smoking, no coffee, no tea, no drugs.

2. Trigger and switch into MCAS



The turning point was taking ciprofloxacin in December 2024.

1. Gastric ulcers in spring 2025, severe pain, weight loss.


2. Introduction of certain peptides for repair (such as BPC-157) which, in my case, violently reactivated inflammation and MCAS instead of soothing them.


3. Taking 10 g of glutamine to “repair” the gut, which triggered hepatic encephalopathy with an ammonia crisis (head about to explode, confusion, feeling like I was dying).


4. Digestive terrain already fragile, on top of which a severe SIBO was added.



From that moment on, my body started reacting to almost everything: foods, supplements, medications, sometimes even to a single sip of a supposedly non problematic food.

3. How MCAS looks concretely in my case



For those who will recognise themselves, here is what my daily life looks like when MCAS is active.

1. Extreme histamine intolerance



Reactions within 20 to 30 minutes after certain foods.

Itching, burning sensations, sometimes tachycardia, general malaise.

Unable to tolerate foods that are normally considered “healthy”: certain nuts, certain plant milks, some fermented products, reheated leftovers, etc.

2. Dependence on DAO (diamine oxidase)



I currently have to take DAO with every meal, at a very high dose, to avoid going into crisis.

Without DAO, even a small sip of a drink containing hazelnut or another problematic food can trigger symptoms in less than 30 minutes.

This has been going on for more than 1 year.

3. Drug reactivity



Many “standard” medications have become risky for me.

Some molecules trigger violent reactions (digestive, neurological, cardiac) even though they are theoretically “well tolerated” in most people.

I am forced to evaluate each new drug as a potential bomb.

4. Gut and SIBO



Severe SIBO with abdominal pain, bloating, alternating diarrhoea and loose stools.

Each supplement intake or dietary change can reactivate digestive symptoms and, in cascade, MCAS.

5. Brain and nervous system



Feeling of an inflamed brain, difficulty handling stress or sensory stimulation.

Constant hypervigilance regarding my body’s reactions, which increases mental load.

4. Things that clearly made me worse



I am not giving advice, I am only sharing what, on my terrain, was catastrophic.

1. Glutamine at 10 g



Taken in my case to repair the gut.
Result: hepatic encephalopathy with ammonia spike, feeling of intracranial pressure, confusion, emergency state.

Since then, I am extremely wary of anything that can increase ammonia or overload the liver.

2. BPC-157



Molecule often presented as “repairing” tissues, gut, etc.

On my MCAS terrain with gut on fire, it was a major trigger of inflammatory and mast cell crisis.

Bad timing, bad terrain, very bad experience.

3. Ornithine aspartate



Given to help reduce ammonia.

In my case, worsening, intolerance, increased symptoms.

I stopped it.

5. What has really helped me (or at least stabilised me)



I distinguish several pillars.

1. Managing ammonia and the liver



OKG (ornithine alpha ketoglutarate)
Where ornithine aspartate was dragging me down, OKG was a real turning point for me. It is what helped me get out of the ammonia crisis. My brain gradually freed itself from that feeling of “internal pressure”.

Extreme caution with anything that overloads the liver
No alcohol, no hepatotoxic drugs if I can avoid them, no experimental intakes without reflection.

2. Treating SIBO



Rifaximin
Targeted SIBO treatment over several weeks, combined with other approaches.
It is not a miracle solution, but it clearly improved the overall digestive terrain and reduced part of the symptoms.

Antimicrobial plants (oregano, silver, etc.)
Used with caution, in a supervised context.
Useful to reduce bacterial load, but must be handled carefully to avoid triggering MCAS even more.

Colostrum dosed at 30% IGG
10 g per day in the morning and 10 g in the evening before meals.

3. Managing MCAS and histamine



High dose DAO before each meal
Without exaggeration, this is what has allowed me to keep eating.
I am still dependent on it, but it lets me manage daily life at least minimally.

4. Tissue and immune repair



Peptides such as GHK-Cu, KPV, Thymosin alpha-1 (in a supervised context)
Moderate positive effects on inflammation, recovery, and the feeling of “body damaged everywhere”.
Nothing miraculous, but slow and visible progression over several months.

5. Lifestyle and movement



Daily walking
30 minutes of walking per day on a treadmill. Even on difficult days, trying to keep a minimum of movement to avoid general deconditioning.

Protected sleep
Strict sleep hygiene.
Sometimes using low dose melatonin to reset the sleep cycle when everything goes off the rails.

6. Where I am today



I am not in full remission, but I am no longer in the absolute hell of the beginning.

What has improved:

1. I am no longer in permanent hepatic encephalopathy.


2. My SIBO is less severe than at its worst.


3. My diet, even if limited, is a bit more varied than when almost everything was triggering me.


4. I can move a bit every day, whereas before I was almost pinned down by fatigue and reactions.


5. Some blood tests have become acceptable again (low inflammation, thyroid stabilised, etc.).



What is still very difficult:

1. I still have to take DAO with every meal, at high dose, more than 1 year later.


2. My liver remains fragile and I live with the fear of having another ammonia crisis.


3. MCAS is still there, ready to flare as soon as I step slightly outside the lines.


4. Each new drug, each new supplement is a game of Russian roulette.


5. Conclusion



MCAS, in my case, is not “a simple allergy” or a “psychological imbalance”, but the logical consequence of a terrain that has been weakened by ciprofloxacin. As long as the gut and liver remain in crisis, mast cells will keep going out of control.

Even with a strict strategy, I clearly see that MCAS retains an unpredictable component. Some days, with identical food, I react much more. There are probably still poorly understood factors (autonomic nervous system, hormones, environmental factors, invisible micro triggers) that go beyond purely digestive explanations.

For the moment, I see my MCAS as a protection system that has become paranoid: it detects threats everywhere because it has been bombarded with insults (infectious, medicinal, toxic). My current battle plan is to:

1. Reduce as much as possible the load on the liver and gut.


2. Keep treating SIBO and intestinal permeability gradually.


3. Soothe the nervous system and stabilise sleep.


4. Keep DAO and histamine management as a crutch for as long as necessary.


5. Why I am posting here and what I am looking for



I am posting here because I know many people are living the same thing:

Reacting to everything and not feeling taken seriously.

Being told that “everything is fine” because standard tests are normal.

Being forced to become an expert of your own body just to survive daily life.

What I am particularly interested in is feedback from people who:

1. Have had severe MCAS triggered or worsened by a digestive issue (SIBO, intestinal permeability, infection, antibiotics, etc.).


2. Have been dependent on DAO for months or years and managed to reduce the dose or stop it.


3. Have found concrete strategies (natural, medicinal or other) that genuinely reduced mast cell reactivity over 6 to 12 months.


I would be really interested in:

Protocols that worked for you in the medium and long term.

Mistakes that made you relapse.

How you navigated things with doctors (allergists, internists, gastroenterologists, etc.).

Thank you to those who will have read to the end. We do not choose to have MCAS, but at least we can try not to go through it completely alone. 💜",1,1764874900.0,MCAS,1,1.0,False

It was really exceptional musical experience with Cayin Ru6 yet I have not based my entire review on its impressions & have used impressions from other sources as Cayin Ru6 colours presentation &not everyone likes it.

So, I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn’t like presentation with bright sources.



Ear tips :

I used variety of ear tips to test the iems from small bore to wide bore and exotic ear tips. Best pairing that I found was with Penon orange liquer ear tips for me.



Sound Impressions:

Bass/ Lows:

Sub bass rumbles. It has physical feel to it. Yet it does not overshadow. It is quick decay one. Mid bass slaps. It also is physical; you can feel and hear it. Drums, kick drums are fantastic. Their tone & timbre feels natural. Guitars feel natural with right amount of reverberations. Piano notes are excellent. Bass is not for bass heads. For others it is perfect.

Overall Bass/Lows 5/5
 

Mids:

Male and female vocals both shines here. Female vocals are to die for. They can get bit intense but perfect for me. You can hear voice modulations in vocals. Technically vocals are bit recessed here. Yet I would call it done perfectly. Hence, they don’t get shouty. Instruments in the mids are well represented. You can see that they are not smeared or congested.

Overall Mids 5/5



Treble/Highs:

nicely tuned in the treble region. No shrillness or harshness. You can enjoy at high volumes also.
Nice extension in air region. Wide soundstage and tall in height. Soundstage feels truly holographic. A closer to open out of head feeling soundstage. No instrument smearing or congestion. All are spread out evenly. You can spot them individually in mix. Positional queue are great. All macro and micro details are well presented. You will not miss any detail in the mix. Crashes, cymbals, flutes sound natural. One of the best treble tunings heard in long time.

Overall Treble/Highs 5/5



Song Impressions:

Angel by Massive Attack

Started droning of the sub bass can be heard and felt. This entire song has continuous sub bass droning you can feel it and hear it. It is on point. Vocals are as it should be. Neither front nor back. Drumbeats are on point. Shakers feel well represented Guitars are on point. You can feel the strings being stringed. crashes are on point. Entire mix doesn’t get congested or smeared. Mix sounds precise. Overall great reproduction.

Guitars are on point. String reverberations are on point. Guitars are central to this song and they are exceptional. Crashes sound natural. Drum strike and their reverberations are on point and natural. Mid bass impact is great it’s just in perfect amount. No smearing or congestion is felt. Drivers easily handle this complex song. This song can get intense depending on tuning. But here it doesn’t get intense. I thoroughly enjoyed the reproduction here. Excellent reproduction.

Sway by Diana Krall

I am fan of Diana krall. Diana krall sounds sensual in this song. This set does justice to her voice. She sounds the way I remember she should. You can hear the pitch changes in the voice of her. The Background score is there to support her voice and create harmony. Here it does create that harmony. Nothing sounds out of place or pointed, It all blends nicely to create atmosphere that makes this song classic. Overall phenomenal reproduction.

Fly me to moon by Frank Sinatra
One of the classics by frank Sinatra. Here the music doesn’t overshadow vocals. His distinct vocals (light baritones) sound proper. It is always pleasured to listen to his voice. Drums trumpets, strings you name it all instrument shine here. There is no smearing or congestion. Entire mix flows as it should. I really was mesmerized by the song. Exceptional Reproduction.



Final Conclusion:

Penon Voltage is my first ever penon set and an EST one. Never had experienced EST set. Let me tell you I have become EST fan. One of the best treble I have ever heard. No shrillness or artificialness. Penon's choice of drivers is excellent. Anything I threw at it sounded great. Bass is just perfect. Mids are perfect Treble here is like icing on cake. Just perfect. Never had dull moment while listening. Enjoyed all my genres. Had to really listen with intent to find faults. As it was really hard for me. I can safely say that I have found my number 1 set around 1k.  This set and UM stardust are my go-to best and beloved sets at this price point. I can recommend these two sets eyes closed to anyone.

I had skepticism that this set might be forward in one or two aspects but to my astonishment it is tuned perfectly with proper emphasis in right places. This set speaks to me feels like it was made for me. Penon has done amazing job tuning it. I think I have shilled it beyond the need but let me remind you, I am speaking about it so much as I have truly fallen in love with it. You can see that throughout this review, I hope.

I have written the title as Penon Voltage a Musical Jolt & yes, it is. I can swear by it, and I implore you to listen to it yourself to truly understand it. Now let’s wrap up. I have put you through a lot.

Thank you for enduring with me till end. Now go grab cup of Hot coffee and let’s listen to safe high that is Music.

Sad lessons learned - some products can go bad after years of no use (the liquid eyeshadow was totally dried up and beyond dehydration)

Funny thing - I had the bbw spray for so long they've changed the packaging of the current one 😂

I wish I could reuse the glass spray bottle from Versace cuz it's such a convenient size, but sadly the sprayer doesn't come off  :( 

The eos chapstick wouldn't go down and the balm broke, so I put it in a mini container and am just using it with my finger for now (the texture is not super smooth so I may end up tossing it).  ",5,1764874756.0,ProjectPan,0,1.0,False

Another week another review. New week new brand. Finally, I got chance to review elusive brand Penon. Long story short another opportunity presented by AudioGeek India review tour. They had Penon Voltage on tour, and I had requested for to be included in review tour. I was bidding days after days and finally one morning I got message that it was coming towards me. I was bit sceptical how it would be what to expect etc. Well, all my thoughts and opinions have gone for toss out of the window. What are my thoughts now after some time with this set please read on.

First of all, let me thank AudioGeek India for giving me opportunity to review tis set. Special thanks to man behind AudioGeek family Sandeep bhai. Also mighty thanks to Penon for review tour.

I was not paid or given any kind of compensation for this review. This review is my thoughts and opinions about this set.

My biases well I like DD sets over Hybrids and Planars. Also keep in mind my music choices listed in the music genre section. Keep both in mind while reading my review.

Now that all the pleasantries are done. Let’s get on with the meat and potatoes of this review.


Build Quality:

I received set with only 2 cables and iems. Nothing more nothing less. Well, the iems are made up of resin. One that looks really good quality. Iems are bit big in size. Iem nozzles are long providing deep fit. Nozzles don’t have lip so ear tips might slip off. Nozzles have no filters so need to take care so that they don’t clog up. Shell has two tuning switches, and one pressure adjust vent if I am not wrong.

Provided both cables one Penon OSS cable and another one both are premium one. They scream premium. I liked both. There was no sonic difference. But for entire review I have used the non-stock cable. Both cables are multicore ones with metal terminations and chin synch plus separator. Both are terminated in 0.78 mm and 4.4 mm. None of them is modular.

Overall Build Quality 5/5

  

Comfort & Fit:

Shells are big but fit my ears well. Well I have elephant ears everything fits me. Small ear people beware. Check before purchase. Nozzles are lip less yet I had no slip offs. Shells don’t cause any pain or weird fatigue issues in my ears.

Cables are supple and non-microphonic. Chin synch work stays in place. Roadie wrapping them is easy.

Overall Comfort & Fit 5/5



Configuration:

4 sonion ESTs + 4 Sonion BAs + 2 8 mm Dynamic drivers. 4-way crossover. 13 ohms impedance. 106dB sensitivity. Frequency response range 5Hz-70KHz.

My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half. We truly are best friends and love each other dearly. He is not a very romantic person, which is fine, I am the one who likes romance more. I recently said I would like more spontaneous romance and flowers (we’ve already talked about flowers before so that is nothing new). He said “you never do these things for me so that’s a double standard”. I feel like I do romantic things for him like buying us matching pjs and I cook for him every Wednesday. He has told me in the past that he doesn’t need romance or anything else from me because what I do is enough. Which is good and fine but when he says that in a way to use against me it makes me crazy because what he already does for me is great and I feel very loved but these are just other ways to make me feel loved. He said “if what I do is enough why do you need more”. But it’s not even about that, it makes me feel EXTRA special and loved. I’ve told him that before and he counter with saying “well I never ask you to do anything extra for me” but how is that my problem?? He says it hurts his feelings when I ask for things like that but also how is that my problem too? I just don’t know what to do. He does take me out to dinner a couple times a month and does drive most of the time. He shows affection, compliments me a lot, and talks about our future together. Sometimes he will buy me coffee too. But I also do all those things, I’ll offer to pay (sometimes he doesn’t let me), I cook him dinner, I keep pop at my house for him, etc… I need advice please. He makes me feel like I am asking for too much. And I’ve told him before I don’t need romance all the time or flowers all the time or if he got me flowers twice a year I’d be happy!! He even said that the special days we will treat it like a special day such as birthday’s or anniversaries. Like yes of course but that is only 4 days out of 365.

I'm thinking it's okay to say hi and mention you're a fan if you happen to be in elevator with them, or you're taking their order at a coffee shop. or something along those lines. I can't really imagine a situation where it wouldn't be weird to actually walk up to them. But maybe I'm wrong. What do you guys think?",13,1764874564.0,kpopthoughts,10,0.88,False

Another week another review. New week new brand. Finally, I got chance to review elusive brand Penon. Long story short another opportunity presented by AudioGeek India review tour. They had Penon Voltage on tour, and I had requested for to be included in review tour. I was bidding days after days and finally one morning I got message that it was coming towards me. I was bit sceptical how it would be what to expect etc. Well, all my thoughts and opinions have gone for toss out of the window. What are my thoughts now after some time with this set please read on.

First of all, let me thank AudioGeek India for giving me opportunity to review tis set. Special thanks to man behind AudioGeek family Sandeep bhai. Also mighty thanks to Penon for review tour.

I was not paid or given any kind of compensation for this review. This review is my thoughts and opinions about this set.

My biases well I like DD sets over Hybrids and Planars. Also keep in mind my music choices listed in the music genre section. Keep both in mind while reading my review.

Now that all the pleasantries are done. Let’s get on with the meat and potatoes of this review.


Build Quality:

I received set with only 2 cables and iems. Nothing more nothing less. Well, the iems are made up of resin. One that looks really good quality. Iems are bit big in size. Iem nozzles are long providing deep fit. Nozzles don’t have lip so ear tips might slip off. Nozzles have no filters so need to take care so that they don’t clog up. Shell has two tuning switches, and one pressure adjust vent if I am not wrong.

Provided both cables one Penon OSS cable and another one both are premium one. They scream premium. I liked both. There was no sonic difference. But for entire review I have used the non-stock cable. Both cables are multicore ones with metal terminations and chin synch plus separator. Both are terminated in 0.78 mm and 4.4 mm. None of them is modular.

Overall Build Quality 5/5

  

  
Comfort & Fit:

Shells are big but fit my ears well. Well I have elephant ears everything fits me. Small ear people beware. Check before purchase. Nozzles are lip less yet I had no slip offs. Shells don’t cause any pain or weird fatigue issues in my ears.

Cables are supple and non-microphonic. Chin synch work stays in place. Roadie wrapping them is easy.

Overall Comfort & Fit 5/5



Configuration:

4 sonion ESTs + 4 Sonion BAs + 2 8 mm Dynamic drivers. 4-way crossover. 13 ohms impedance. 106dB sensitivity. Frequency response range 5Hz-70KHz.



Music Genre Used for this Review:

Hip-hop/EDM/Rap/Rock both classic and hard/Bollywood Music/Pop/Jazz/Regional music etc.

4. Fiio KA13
5. EPZ TP50
6. Onix alpha xi 1
7. Cayin RU6
8. Cayin RU7
9. Tempotec V3 Blaze

This iem is very efficient (106dB) as when I used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive this iem with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So iem is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU6, onix alpha xi 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze.

Sources scaling Tempotec v3 blaze > Cayin RU7> Onix Alpha xi 1 > Cayin Ru6 > EPZ TP50 > Fiio KA13 > Moondrop Dawn pro > Fiio KA3> Jcally jm6

It was really exceptional musical experience with Cayin Ru6 yet I have not based my entire review on its impressions & have used impressions from other sources as Cayin Ru6 colours presentation &not everyone likes it.

So, I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn’t like presentation with bright sources.



Ear tips :

I used variety of ear tips to test the iems from small bore to wide bore and exotic ear tips. Best pairing that I found was with Penon orange liquer ear tips for me.



Sound Impressions:

Bass/ Lows:

Sub bass rumbles. It has physical feel to it. Yet it does not overshadow. It is quick decay one. Mid bass slaps. It also is physical; you can feel and hear it. Drums, kick drums are fantastic. Their tone & timbre feels natural. Guitars feel natural with right amount of reverberations. Piano notes are excellent. Bass is not for bass heads. For others it is perfect.

Overall Bass/Lows 5/5
 

Mids:

Male and female vocals both shines here. Female vocals are to die for. They can get bit intense but perfect for me. You can hear voice modulations in vocals. Technically vocals are bit recessed here. Yet I would call it done perfectly. Hence, they don’t get shouty. Instruments in the mids are well represented. You can see that they are not smeared or congested.

Overall Mids 5/5



Treble/Highs:

nicely tuned in the treble region. No shrillness or harshness. You can enjoy at high volumes also.
Nice extension in air region. Wide soundstage and tall in height. Soundstage feels truly holographic. A closer to open out of head feeling soundstage. No instrument smearing or congestion. All are spread out evenly. You can spot them individually in mix. Positional queue are great. All macro and micro details are well presented. You will not miss any detail in the mix. Crashes, cymbals, flutes sound natural. One of the best treble tunings heard in long time.

Overall Treble/Highs 5/5



Song Impressions:

Angel by Massive Attack

Started droning of the sub bass can be heard and felt. This entire song has continuous sub bass droning you can feel it and hear it. It is on point. Vocals are as it should be. Neither front nor back. Drumbeats are on point. Shakers feel well represented Guitars are on point. You can feel the strings being stringed. crashes are on point. Entire mix doesn’t get congested or smeared. Mix sounds precise. Overall great reproduction.

Ego death by polyphia
 
Guitars are on point. String reverberations are on point. Guitars are central to this song and they are exceptional. Crashes sound natural. Drum strike and their reverberations are on point and natural. Mid bass impact is great it’s just in perfect amount. No smearing or congestion is felt. Drivers easily handle this complex song. This song can get intense depending on tuning. But here it doesn’t get intense. I thoroughly enjoyed the reproduction here. Excellent reproduction.

Sway by Diana Krall

I am fan of Diana krall. Diana krall sounds sensual in this song. This set does justice to her voice. She sounds the way I remember she should. You can hear the pitch changes in the voice of her. The Background score is there to support her voice and create harmony. Here it does create that harmony. Nothing sounds out of place or pointed, It all blends nicely to create atmosphere that makes this song classic. Overall phenomenal reproduction.

Fly me to moon by Frank Sinatra
One of the classics by frank Sinatra. Here the music doesn’t overshadow vocals. His distinct vocals (light baritones) sound proper. It is always pleasured to listen to his voice. Drums trumpets, strings you name it all instrument shine here. There is no smearing or congestion. Entire mix flows as it should. I really was mesmerised by the song. Exceptional Reproduction.



Final Conclusion:

Penon Voltage is my first ever penon set and an EST one. Never had experienced EST set. Let me tell you I have become EST fan. One of the best treble I have ever heard. No shrillness or artificialness. Penon's choice of drivers is excellent. Anything I threw at it sounded great. Bass is just perfect. Mids are perfect Treble here is like icing on cake. Just perfect. Never had dull moment while listening. Enjoyed all my genres. Had to really listen with intent to find faults. As it was really hard for me. I can safely say that I have found my number 1 set around 1k.  This set and UM stardust are my go-to best and beloved sets at this price point. I can recommend these two sets eyes closed to anyone.

I had skepticism that this set might be forward in one or two aspects but to my astonishment it is tuned perfectly with proper emphasis in right places. This set speaks to me feels like it was made for me. Penon has done amazing job tuning it. I think I have shilled it beyond the need but let me remind you, I am speaking about it so much as I have truly fallen in love with it. You can see that throughout this review, I hope.

\- Nov 7th: One of my classmates in my 1st block class decided to offer me his iced coffee, because he said, in his words, ""it's too bitter"" for his liking. I was about to decline out of being ""kind"", but he handed it to me anyway, so... free drink is a free drink.

\- Nov 9th: I had issues cashing out from one of those ""get paid to do surveys"" apps due to the face verification being finicky at best. But, next thing I know, after a few hours, it went through to my PayPal without me having to re-verify.

\- Nov 26th: I've had a really big issue with being extremely anxious at times, but when I had an argument with my sister - that she initiated - I wasn't as heightened as I would've been, && I just stared at her like she was crazy.

I've met a lot of fascinating people, both online and offline. My work is pretty interesting, so thats something I'm grateful for.  I was in a pretty great relationship that lasted quite a bit.  All in all, life has been pretty great.   
  
A few years ago, I was someone who's daily routine was just my work and my apartment where I'd just sit on computer/whatever gaming console I had at the time, watch a whole lot of content,  a few phonecalls to my school buddies once in a while, and a series of very dumb and sometimes serious conversations with myself.  I was someone who decided to just remain single for the rest of my life.  I had become so used to it, and I used to really like spending time with myself.   


But life had other plans, and I met someone and things just happend, and we broke up. I was prepared to go back to being single and I assumed it would be just like riding a cycle, and I could  go back to my old ways. But over the last four years, a lot has changed, as it inevitably would.  People would move on with their lives, and phonecalls and meetups with friends are few and far inbetween.  I mean, I don't know why I'm surprised, its only natural. So life is lonliner than it used to be. But it is what it is.   


But besides the loneliness, I realized how much I actually missed that connection  I had in the realtionship.  I know it's obvious to most people, but I guess I was dumb for thinking I could get over it. 

So, I'm looking for someone to chat with throughout the day. We can talk about anything from the existential dread of a Monday morning to the best places to find good biryani in this city. To  talk about mindless scrolling, a sounding board for bad jokes, and maybe, just maybe, someone to meet up with for a coffee or a beer.  
If it grows into something meaningful and long term, that would be amazing.

A little about me: I'm 33, work in research and also on a startup (I know, shocking), and have a slightly unhealthy obsession with sci-fi movies and shows. I'm also a pretty decent cook and can whip up a mean biriyani/pasta.

I've been in Bangalore for the better part of a decade now and life has been pretty interesting. I've met a lot of fascinating people, both online and offline. My work is pretty interesting, so thats something I'm grateful for.  I was in a pretty great relationship that lasted quite a bit.  All in all, life has been pretty great.

A few years ago, I was someone who's daily routine was just my work and my apartment where I'd just sit on computer/whatever gaming console I had at the time, watch a whole lot of content,  a few phonecalls to my school buddies once in a while, and a series of very dumb and sometimes serious conversations with myself.  I was someone who decided to just remain single for the rest of my life.  I had become so used to it, and I used to really like spending time with myself.

But life had other plans, and I met someone and things just happend, and we broke up. I was prepared to go back to being single and I assumed it would be just like riding a cycle, and I could  go back to my old ways. But over the last four years, a lot has changed, as it inevitably would.  People would move on with their lives, and phonecalls and meetups with friends are few and far inbetween.  I mean, I don't know why I'm surprised, its only natural. So life is lonliner than it used to be. But it is what it is.

But besides the loneliness, I realized how much I actually missed that connection  I had in the realtionship.  I know it's obvious to most people, but I guess I was dumb for thinking I could get over it.

So, I'm looking for someone to chat with throughout the day. We can talk about anything from the existential dread of a Monday morning to the best places to find good biryani in this city. To  talk about mindless scrolling, a sounding board for bad jokes, and maybe, just maybe, someone to meet up with for a coffee or a beer.  
If it grows into something meaningful and long term, that would be amazing.

A little about me: I'm 33, work in research and also on a startup (I know, shocking), and have a slightly unhealthy obsession with sci-fi movies and shows. I'm also a pretty decent cook and can whip up a mean biriyani/pasta.

1pe89mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/enoescapestheinternet/comments/1pe89mc/reno_escape_the_internet_with_me/,"Reno, Escape the Internet with me!","Hey all, I'm Alex- a Reno local and introvert. 

I've recently been craving community. Inspired by the posts on the main Reno subreddit seeking friendship, I decided to take action and start a community of likeminded people who also want to meet others. 

***Reno Escapes the Internet*** is a subreddit for people who are:

* Planning an in-person activity
* Seeking company to local events
* ISO friendship
* Are open to new experiences and willing to be vulnerable and curious with others

As your (not so fearless) leader, I am committing to planning and posting about a meet up or two per month with no formal expectation or plans other than some light social contact and possible conversation. It's my hope that overtime, more people will join me and take the initiative to plan their own low-pressure meet ups. 

A few guiding principles: 

1. In this time of massive political division, I am hoping we can all be down for genuine inclusivity. Exclusion further divides us, I am hoping we can all get curious and be open to meeting people across all spectrums of identity. 

2. Sell yourself, not your hustle. In an effort to make this about community, I ask that you focus on connection and what you have to offer as a human. Some events may naturally cost money (ex. meeting up at a show with a ticket cost) but our community is about person to person connection, not a sales pitch. 

3. Go at your own pace. I welcome outside observers and slow-to-warm-up-ers. True community welcomes all and it's my hope that people who normally shy away from in person events can take a risk and show up as themselves.

So, with that being said. Please collaborate, take initiative and SHOW UP!!! I plan on posting about a coffee meet up for the following weekend (Dec 12/13), maybe I will see you there!

I like the idea of having a *go-to recipe*. But I think I've overcommitted a bit, thinking that ""for most beans I can just adjust the grind size and get something good"". So, after experimenting with a few recipes, I decided that a simple *1 minute bloom at 3x the dose, followed by a single pour to achieve a 1:16 ratio* was my daily driver, my go-to. The main thing I would change with different beans was grind size. And sometimes I got great cups!

But over time I found my cups were hit and miss. Sometimes I would add a little swirl for agitation and it might improve. But still, not too satisfying. So, I started playing around with the 4:6 method (which I had previously disliked) and suddenly the brew improved dramatically.

I guess I have two lessons learned:

1. Don't overcommit to a single recipe.
   * If your *go-to* isn't satisfying with a given bean, don't be afraid to try something completely different.
2. It might be difficult to learn consistency if your coffee subscription gives you different beans every time.

1pe87cw,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1pe87cw/my_postciprofloxacin_testimony_1_year_of_struggle/,"My post-ciprofloxacin testimony: 1 year of struggle, what I tested, and where I am today","I post here because I feel a bit between two worlds: too “complicated” for classical medicine, too “extreme” for people who have never been floxed. I want to tell my post-ciprofloxacin journey, from A to Z, with what it triggered, everything I tried to survive and rebuild myself, and where I am today, 1 year later.

I know that many of us feel alone, misunderstood, or even mistaken for psychiatric cases. If my testimony can just resonate with 1 person, it will already be useful.

1. My terrain before ciprofloxacin

I am not going “neutral”. Before being floxed, I already had fragile and complicated terrain.

PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome).

Hypothyroidism under treatment.

So a body that held together, but already in balance. Despite this, I had found a lifestyle that was more or less manageable, I did not take drugs, no alcohol, no coffee, no tobacco, I paid attention to my diet.

2. The beginning of the nightmare: ciprofloxacin

December 2024: I am prescribed ciprofloxacin. In the moment, I trust. I do not realize that I am entering another dimension.

After the doses, my health starts to go into decline. Not just “a bit of side effects”, but a feeling that each system of the body is collapsing one after the other.

3. What “flox” triggered in me

Digestive system: Severe SIBO, intestinal pain, diarrhea, bloating, violent food intolerances. My gut became a battlefield.

Histamine and MCAS: extreme histamine intolerance. I ended up having to take DAO (diamine oxidase) with every meal, in very high doses. Even a sip of hazelnut milk could trigger itching and symptoms within 20 to 30 minutes.

Liver and ammonia: attack of hepatic encephalopathy after taking 10 g of glutamine to “repair” the intestine. Feeling like your head is exploding, confused, feeling like you're dying. Ammonia has become my number 1 enemy.

Neurological and psychological: explosive anxiety, worsening of mood disorders, brain fatigue, difficulty tolerating noise, stress, stimulation. Sensation of brain in permanent inflammation.

Pain and fatigue: diffuse pain, feeling of “damaged tissue”, overwhelming fatigue, intolerance to exercise at times.

The hardest part isn't just the symptoms, it's the domino effect: each attempt to repair one system seemed to trigger another.

4. Attempts that pushed me deeper

I think it's important to talk about this, because many of us test things in a hurry and panic.

Glutamine: taken at 10 g to help the intestine. In my case, this is what triggered the hepatic encephalopathy and the ammonia crisis. One of the worst experiences of my life.

Ornithine aspartate: given to reduce ammonia. In my case, worsening of the condition, hypertension. I finally stopped her.

BPC-157: Used at one time for ulcers and tissue repair. In my case, violent awakening from MCAS and worsening of digestive burns. Bad timing, bad terrain.

Certain antibiotics and “classic” molecules: very poorly tolerated on my post-flox and fragile liver. Feeling like I'm poisoning myself with each attempt.

I'm not saying that these molecules are “bad” for everyone, I'm just saying that post-cipro, with a fragile liver and active MCAS, the body becomes totally unpredictable.

5. Things that helped me (at least partially)

1. For SIBO and ammonia

OKG (ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate): where ornithine aspartate was sinking me, OKG was a real turning point. This is what helped me get out of the ammonia crisis. My brain gradually “cleared”.

Rifaximin: targeted treatment of SIBO over several weeks, combined with other approaches. It didn't solve everything, but I felt a real overall digestive improvement.

Plants and extracts such as oregano and silver (in a box): added to the treatment to help reduce the bacterial load in the intestine. It was useful, but you had to dose it carefully to avoid igniting it even more.


2. For food tolerance and histamine

High dose DAO before meals: without it, I literally couldn't eat. Even today, 1 year later, I need DAO with every meal to avoid itching and reactions.

Ultra simplified diet: reduction of foods rich in histamine, FODMAP, additives. Lots of food rotations, constant testing.

Work on SIBO and the intestine: each little digestive progress has slightly improved my tolerance to certain foods, but it is very slow.


3. For the brain, inflammation and repair

Avoid taking anything that aggravates inflammation: alcohol, coffee, tea, energy drinks, excess exercise, lack of sleep.

Work on sleep: stabilize schedules, sometimes use low-dose melatonin to get sleep back on track.

Peptides and regenerative support (GHK-Cu, KPV, Thymosine alpha-1, etc.): these are tools that I have tested to support tissue and immune repair. Moderate but real positive effects on overall recovery, inflammation and the feeling of “body in pieces”.

4. For bone, tendons and body reconstruction

I am in osteoporosis with arthrodesis and post-cipro, so I targeted very hard the bone, tendons and muscles.

Specific collagens (Fortibone, Tendoforte, Fortigel, Bodybalance, Peptendure, Verisol): I turned towards collagen peptides studied for bone, tendons, fascia, skin. My bone loss measured by CTX in the blood went from 0.500 ng to 0.135 in a few months. I observed better muscle recovery, slightly less severe pain and stabilization or even a slight improvement in bone density. This all costs me dearly unfortunately.

Quality proteins (whey, diet): aim for at least 1.5 g of protein per kg of weight to nourish muscle and bone reconstruction, within the limits of what my intestine tolerates.

Daily walking on a treadmill: even when everything is going wrong, keep a minimum of movement. 30 minutes of walking per day, even slowly, to avoid total degradation.

5. For hormones and breast/uterine cancer prevention

PCOS field, breast cysts.

Progesterone (vaginal, and cream on the breasts): to counterbalance the effect of estrogen and calm sore breasts, while monitoring the impact on mood.

Low dose iodine, taken with caution due to heart, thyroid and personal sensitivity. (3 mg of Lugol's iodine solution per day with selenium to avoid Hashimoto's)

Global work on toxins, hormonal load, diet, vitamin D,

None of this is a “miracle”, but taken together, it helps to stabilize and reduce certain risks.

6. Where I am today, 1 year later

I am not cured. I'm not going to pretend.

What's better:

I no longer have hepatic encephalopathy. My brain is no longer in a permanent death fog.

My SIBO is much less violent than in the months following the flox. I can eat more things than at the worst time, even if it's still fragile.

I can walk 30 minutes a day. My body is starting to accept a minimum of activity again.

My blood tests have improved on several markers: low inflammation, good vitamin D, stabilized thyroid status, etc.

Psychologically, I have less of the feeling of “dying every day”. I took a little bit of projection into the future.

What remains very hard:

I still have to take DAO in high doses with every meal, 1 year later. Histamine tolerance remains hell.

My liver remains fragile, I have to be careful of anything that can increase ammonia or toxic load.

I remain extremely hypervigilant regarding medications. Each new molecule is a risk on my post-flox terrain.

Fatigue, sensitivity to stress and neuro symptoms remain present, although less extreme.


7. What I wish someone had told me from the start

1. No, it’s not “in your head”. A fluoroquinolone can really ruin tissues, mitochondria, nerves, tendons, the intestine, the liver. The effects can last a long time after stopping.

2. You have the right to refuse other risky molecules if your instinct tells you that your body will not follow. No one will experience the consequences for you.

3. You will try things that will make you feel good, and others that will make you feel even worse. Just because “everyone” praises a molecule doesn’t mean your body will tolerate it.


4. You are not weak because you take 6 months to recover what others recover in 3 weeks. You just don't have the same terrain.


5. You can progress by micro-steps. Sometimes it will be 1 step forward, 2 steps back. But over the course of the year, there can be a real global movement towards the better.



8. Why am I posting here



Because I know there are other floxed people who will recognize themselves in this mixture of:

digestive damage + histamine + liver + brain,

medical loneliness,

tired of explaining over and over that “no, it’s not just anxiety”,

stubborn hope of finding a livable body.


If you have:

experienced severe SIBO post-flox,

episodes of ammonia, encephalopathy, or strange reactions to glutamine,

long-term dependence on DAO,

or simply a chaotic post-fluoroquinolone journey,


I would really appreciate your testimonials: what concretely helped over 6 to 12 months, what mistakes you would make differently, and how you are doing today.

Thanks to those who read to the end. We don't choose to be floxed, but we can at least decide to no longer go through it completely alone.",4,1764873994.0,floxies,6,0.84,False

I have AxSpa. I was diagnosed about 2 years ago, but I've had it for over a decade. I am on the medication merry-go-round with some successes and some failures. 

I was wondering what tools people use everyday outside of medication to help with pain or other symptoms. In particular, do you have some sort of back support that you like and bring around with you? My pain is primarily between my shoulder blades, my neck, and my lower back. I often feel in less pain when I cross my legs while seated, but I sometimes get knee issues from that. I love going to coffee shops, but the seating there can be a nightmare for me. So far my mobility has not been affected other than feet pain and occasional knee pain.

  
Here is a list of things I use. I just thought compiling a list may be helpful! :)

1. Moist Heating Pads: For some reason only  moist heat pads work for me. Great for back pain and GI symptoms.

2. Rolling bags: I can carry a small small purse, but other than that, any weight on my shoulders and back is bad. I use rolling crates, rolling backpacks, rolling carts. I love wheels!

3. Telescopic stool: It has terrible back support, but it's nice to have something to sit on when others are standing for long periods of time or sitting on the floor.

4. Shoes with Padding (Nimbus Gel 25): These were a game-changer for me. My pain from walking went away. Unfortunately they don't make this verison anymore. I just got the Hoka Bondi 9 as a replacement, but I don't like them as much.",3,1764873988.0,ankylosingspondylitis,4,1.0,False

I told myself, I’ll just get one nice piece, a statement item. Something grown-up. Something that says, “I own coasters and know what a mortgage is.”
Enter ims furniture, a friend recommended them, so I started browsing their catalog, and suddenly I was in a full-blown interior design crisis. Why are there so many types of chairs? How do people know the difference between “walnut brown” and “espresso walnut brown”? And who decided a couch should cost as much as a used car?

Is this SIBO?? Help pls","Hey guys, I’m losing my mind. I got diagnosed with celiac about a month ago and have been completely gluten-free except for one tiny accidental exposure (my mom used garlic powder with gluten in it).

My gut actually got a bit better once I cut gluten, but then I messed everything up with probiotics. I started a 7–8 billion CFU probiotic and it was fine after the first few days. THEN like an idiot I switched to a 50 billion probiotic and took it for 3 weeks. That’s when everything went to hell.

Here’s what’s happening:
	•	I am farting nonstop from the second I wake up.
	•	I fart if I eat, I fart if I don’t eat, I fart after I poop, I fart all day.
	•	The smell is so foul and rotten, it literally smells like sulfur/rotten eggs.
	•	I have constant pain, especially in my upper stomach and lower left side.
	•	The pain is CONSTANT — only meds like byscban help.
	•	Bloating 24/7, no hunger cues anymore because my stomach feels permanently full.
	•	My morning poop is like hard little pebbles, then later in the day it becomes soft.
	•	Sometimes food comes out undigested, like I was literally pooping whole chia seeds.
	•	I fainted during a pilates/hot sculpt class yesterday (no idea if it’s related).
	•	Even after stopping the 50B probiotic a week ago, my symptoms are getting worse, not better.

Diet-wise:
	•	I drink black coffee every morning (non-negotiable).
	•	I drink matcha later in the day.
	•	I eat very healthy whole foods most days.
	•	I eat gluten-free breads and products.
	•	I eat a lot of fiber because I’m scared of constipation (broccoli, etc).
	•	I used to take iron but stopped because I didn’t feel like taking it anymore.
	•	I eat Greek yogurt daily.
	•	Once in a while I eat chips or junk but not often.

Symptoms before celiac diagnosis: I farted a lot but it wasn’t THIS bad. Cutting gluten helped.
Symptoms now: FAR worse since the 50 billion probiotic.

I’m honestly terrified. Does this sound like SIBO?
Has anyone had something like this after taking high-dose probiotics?
How long did it take to go away?

It turned into:

* 80+ written pages
* 12 maps
* 12 handouts
* custom stat blocks
* original mechanics
* an emotional storyline I didn’t expect to care this much about
* a surprisingly dark Christmas theme I’m still not sure how I created 

Last week, I hit *publish* for the first time ever.

I wasn’t prepared for the emotional whiplash. The swirling mix of pride, exhaustion, excitement, fear, imposter syndrome, and that weird “now what?” feeling you get when a long project finally ends.

But it’s out there now.  
People have downloaded it.  
And a few have even reached out to say they’re running it for their holiday game nights, which still blows my mind.

I’m sharing this because I know a lot of us here are building things in our free time — late nights, early mornings, endless drafts — and sometimes it feels like no one sees all that hidden work.

So here’s me, sharing mine.  
If anyone wants to take a look or give feedback, here it is:

I got diagnosed with celiac about a month ago and have been completely gluten-free except for one tiny accidental exposure (my mom used garlic powder with gluten in it).

My gut actually got a bit better once I cut gluten, but then I messed everything up with probiotics. I started a 7–8 billion CFU probiotic and it was fine after the first few days because it was prescribed by my doctor. THEN like an idiot I switched to a 50 billion probiotic and took it for 3 weeks. That’s when everything went to hell.

Here’s what’s happening:
	•	I am farting nonstop from the second I wake up.
	•	I fart if I eat, I fart if I don’t eat, I fart after I poop, I fart all day.
	•	The smell is so foul and rotten, it literally smells like sulfur/rotten eggs.
	•	I have constant pain, especially in my upper stomach and lower left side.
	•	The pain is CONSTANT — only meds like byscopan  help.
	•	Bloating 24/7, no hunger cues anymore because my stomach feels permanently full.
	•	My morning poop is like hard little pebbles, then later in the day it becomes soft.
	•	Sometimes food comes out undigested, like I was literally pooping whole chia seeds.
	•	I fainted during a pilates/hot sculpt class yesterday (no idea if it’s related).
	•	Even after stopping the 50B probiotic a week ago, my symptoms are getting worse, not better.

Diet-wise:
	•	I drink black coffee every morning (non-negotiable).
	•	I drink matcha later in the day.
	•	I eat very healthy whole foods most days.
	•	I eat gluten-free breads and products.
	•	I eat a lot of fiber because I’m scared of constipation (broccoli, etc).
	•	I used to take iron but stopped because I didn’t feel like taking it anymore.
	•	I eat Greek yogurt daily.
	•	Once in a while I eat chips or junk but not often.

Symptoms before celiac diagnosis: I farted a lot but it wasn’t THIS bad. Cutting gluten helped.
Symptoms now: FAR worse since the 50 billion probiotic.

I’m honestly terrified. Does this sound like SIBO?

What else should I do and focus on to prepare?,"Hi! So I’m a fairly new runner as I’ve only ever jog and walked on trails, but I can easily run 4 miles on trails now without stopping so long as it’s not a steep incline.

4 years ago, I weighed 208lbs at 4’11” as a 27 year old woman. Long story short, I was going to die because of hereditary heart issues unless I did something. 

Now, I weigh 137lbs, but I know I’m still fairly heavy for my height, so I’m sort of doing now a primarily protein heavy food chart while still being under or at my calorie intake so that I can predominantly lose fat and just be generally lighter.
Before runs, I just make a point the night before to eat pizza or something heavy in carbs that includes like rice and beans for Mexican food and white rice in regard to Chinese or Japanese foods. But the morning of my runs I don’t really have anything except coffee and water.

I’ve essentially been running for I think a year now but this last Tuesday was my first consistent run for 6 miles straight. (Yay!)

My goal is to run AT LEAST 3 days a week with Tuesdays and Thursday being no more than 6 miles while Saturday or Sunday being longer like 10 miles. 

But is there more I should be doing? I regularly go to places like Road runner so I have custom insoles and really great shoes for trail runs and I’m planning this Friday to go and get more cushiony side walk running shoes as my left ankle collapses after a while sometimes. 

But what else should I be doing? Certain stretches before and after runs? Specific dieting? More running? Should I eat during my runs or before? 

Any and all advice is welcome!! Thanks in advance!

A story that fills the gap between Kate and Rick leaving the precinct, and giving their vows, and slightly beyond.","**This is one of my favorite episodes. Yes, I know that some people didn't like the blue screen background, and I admit that it would have been nice to have like it was in 6x23, but it doesn't take away the fact that they get married, and after all that's all I wanted for them.**

**Thru all of their arguments, and all the things that were thrown in their path. They found their way, like Castle once said. Fictional relationships, and Real-life relationships, both take the same route more times than not. From friends, and partners, to lovers, engagements, and finally marriage. It's why a lot of us are Castle fans. It was their journey. Their love story. The reason that people write fanfiction is for the love of these two amazing characters. To fill in the gaps, that a 43-minute episode can't give us.**

**Personally, I don't need the will they won't they crap. It was part of their story, but I loved all the season thru 7, because each season was about them getting closer, and for me, at the end of the day that is what Castle was all about, and why I love this message board.**

**So, I hope you enjoy this version of what could have possibly happened.**

**P.S. Thanks Top Distribution for helping me figure out what to call Kate's wedding outfit. I'm a guy, and I didn't have a clue.**

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

""Kate, will you marry me?""

""I already said yes.""

""Will you marry me... right now.""

Kate's face broadens into a large smile as she starts to understand what he's asking, ""If you're asking what I think you're asking then...yes Castle, I will marry you right now. So, what ideas are floating in that head of yours... what do you need me to do?""

xxxxxxxxxxxxx

Castle went on to explain that he would take care of the marriage license and would call ahead to arrange for a Justice of the Peace. He would have Martha and Alexis go on ahead to the Hampton's and decorate the gazebo out in back and arrange for a local caterer to deliver a dinner for after the wedding. Kate was to call her father, and let him know what was going on, and that she obviously would have to find something to wear.

Because of the early body drop that morning her shift was ending in an hour, so she went to Gates to see if she could leave early. The Captain, told her yes (like she knew something was up), and that she didn't have to report until noon tomorrow, which would give Castle and her time to enjoy being newlyweds, and having a lazy morning. She remembered a unique boutique clothing store that was close to her apartment. While Castle was handling the other stuff, Kate made her way thru the store and found what she was told was a bridal jumpsuit. She had to admit that she'd never heard of that, but she felt good in it, and it fit in all the right places, plus she just couldn't even consider wearing a dress anymore. Bad memories.

xxxxxxxxxxxxx

From all their trips to the Hampton's, she had accumulated toiletries and a couple of work outfits, so all she needed, was her garment bag, housing her wedding outfit. As Castle pulled up, Kate had her garment bag slung over her shoulder.

Castle got out of the car and said, ""Did you find something you like?""

""Yeah, it's not traditional, but I think it works. What are you wearing?""

Castle replies, ""A suit and pants, but an open collar, no tie, so kind of formal, casual? You didn't happen to bring any sexy lingerie, did you?"" as he waggled his eyebrows.

Kate blushed as her cheeks turned pink, ""Maybe...Maybe not. You'll just have to wait and see stud.""

Castle laughs, ""A woman of mystery...I like it!""

""Castle, I hope you don't mind, but I want to drive. It's just something that I need to do. You understand right?""

""Absolutely Kate...I do understand."" Castle wanted for this to be her perfect day, and if this is what she needed, then that was alright by him.

As Kate pulled out into N.Y. traffic she glanced over at Castle and said, ""Babe, I hope you know that we're going to hear a lot of shit form the boys and Lanie about them not being invited.""

Castle heaved a big sigh, ""I can't worry about that Kate. While you were talking to Gates, without giving away what we were planning, I tried to see if they would be available, but neither of them were going to be able to leave for hours, and I found out from Espo that Lanie just got a body brought to the morgue, that needed to be autopsied.""

""Look Kate, I feel like we've been allowing other things and people to get in our way. My disappearance, another husband, our venue and your dress. The Universe is out of balance; we need to get it back in balance. I know if we had told them they would have asked us to wait until they had time. No... Not waiting anymore! I want you to be my wife...Today.

Kate smiles and grabs Castle's hand, ""Not arguing with you Rick, I want to be Mrs. Castle today too, just letting you know that we're going to hear some shit for this.

""You, becoming my wife today is the most important thing to me right now, so all other issues will just have to take a back seat.""

""Okay Castle...you and me...today!""

xxxxxxxxxxxxx

A Kate navigates the N.Y. traffic, Castle looks over at her, and sees her biting her lip, which is a tell, that she wants to ask something. ""Honey, wants on your mind?""

Kate was never one for pet names, but for some reason she never minded honey, or Luv, though she put an immediate stop to Sweet Cheeks. ""Babe, I was wondering if we have time could we...""

Castle interrupts, ""Go and visit your Mom?""

Kate laughs, ""Why doesn't it surprise me that you know what I was going to say.""

""First of all, you're my muse so I always have an inkling of what's on your mind, and yes we have the time. I made sure of that when I called Chief Brady. He told me he knew a justice of the peace, one that owed him favor, so I got it arranged for our ceremony to start around 6:30, so there's plenty of time.""

""Chief Brady Huh? So, his he still brandishing that weapon of his,"" Kate snickers.

""My ears started to bleed; all he wanted to talk about was that shooting from two years ago. It was all I could do to keep him on point, but it's all good now. God that man needs to get a life."" Castle chuckles.

""Be nice Castle, remember his big claim to fame was investigating dogs pooping in neighbor's yards. That shooting was a lifetime event.""

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

As they grew near the cemetery Kate grew more silent. She had taken him for the first time to visit her Mom, when they got engaged, then later when she took him after taking down Bracken. Castle always felt honored that Kate took him to what was for her scared ground. That she trusted him with her most precious thing, and he didn't take this gift lightly.

They got out of the car, and walked silently down the well-worn path, the detritus blowing around their feet as they walked. As they stood in front of the headstone, Castle was always in awe of the words that resided there. ""Vincent Omnia Veritas,"" (Truth Conquers All). He thinks of how Johanna Beckett life lasted only 48 years, and how Kate's been without her for 28 of those years. He looks over at her and sees how much she is struggling and it breaks his heart.

""Mom, we just came to tell you that we're going to take another stab at getting married,"" she hears Castle chuckle. ""I want to tell you how much I... how much I,"" Then she turns and buries her face in Castle's chest, and cries. Castle cradles her head gently against him as she sobs. ""I can't Castle. I just can't.""

Castle continues for her, ""Johanna... Kate and I just want you to know how much we miss you and wish you were there at our wedding, but I know that you'll be there, because Jim still carries your heart within him. You need to know that Kate is everything to me, and I will be there for her always till the day that I die, and if I do something wrong you can always kick my ass when I get up there.""

He hears Kate sniffle and laugh, 'Don't swear in front of my Mom Castle.""

""Oh, like Rebel Becks didn't teach her a few words."" he huffs.

""Touche...Yeah, there were some new ones she had never heard of."" Kate wipes the tears from her eyes with the sleeve of her jacket.  She takes two fingers, and kisses them, then places them of the headstone. ""Love you Mom, watch over us, and keep us safe. Come on Babe, let's get out of here.""

Castle places his two fingers also on the headstone, and says, ""Love you, Johanna.""

Kate looks up at Castle and says, ""Thanks for being there for me Castle, I don't think I could have done this without you.""

As they walk down the path back to the car, Kate puts her head against his shoulder. Castle glances down at her and sees she's still struggling. Castle turns to her and asks, ""Kate, have you thought anything about what you're going to do with your last name? You know I don't care, but I was just wondering.""

Kate said thoughtfully, ""Originally I was going to keep the name Beckett, but after a while I didn't want to have our children's, name hyphenated. So, I think that I'll keep Beckett at work, obviously, but go with Castle for all other things. Is that okay?

He laughs, ""Of course it's okay, I'm happy with any way you want it. You know what would be really funny? When we're back to the precinct, and someone yells out to you, ""Hey Beckett,"" you come back with, ""That's Detective Castle to you.""

Kate thinks to herself, ""Oh this sweet loving man, who can make her laugh, when she feels so down."" Kate bends over clasping her hands to her knees, laughing so hard she coughs. ""Yeah... that would really be funny. We could go around telling everyone that it's Castle and Castle now. If the boys and Lanie aren't pissed enough about not coming to the wedding that will really send them over the edge, but it would really be funny.""

xxxxxxxxxx

Back in the car, they start the final leg of their journey to becoming Husband and Wife.

""So, Castle, what's the master plan once we get there?""

""There's not really a master plan Kate. You get the master bedroom to get yourself ready. Mother and Alexis will be there if you need any help with your hair, or what have you. I'll take the guest room, and your Dad can come with me, and give me the lecture about not being a bad husband.""

Kate glances over at him, ""Don't think you'll have to worry about that. He's always been your biggest advocate. Somehow, he's always known that you would be it for me. He told me once that it was the way I talked about you. He's a smart man.""

""Castle,"" Kate continues, ""Are we having a wedding cake, because if not I have an idea?""

Castle replies, ""No, actually with everything going on I forgot about that. What's your idea?""

""We just passed a sign saying, ""World's Greatest Cupcakes"" in bold type, plus coffee and other pastries. If there any good, we could by a dozen and have that as a replacement.""

""Yeah, Kate that's a good idea. People have actually been doing that at wedding's I hear, though I find it a tad presumptuous that they've claimed to be the World's Best. How can they even possibly think that they've dominated the world in that category?""

""Really Castle...You think they've gone to the brink war over cupcakes?"" She shakes her head, ""I'm marrying a goofball.""

""Yeah, but you love me""

""God help me I do."" she huffs.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

As they turn into the driveway, Kate turns to Castle and says, ""We've got time for this right Babe, I don't want to be in a rush.""

Castle looks at his watch, ""We've got a good hour before we need to be there, so let's just have fun and take our time. I'll let you know, I won't let us be late.""

As they get out of the car Castle says, ""Hey Beckett, kind of befitting having coffee before our nuptials, considering its part of our love story, and you know that I love to make you smile.""

""Yeah, and don't forget that I'm...Remarkable, Challenging, Frustrating and Maddening,"" she smirks.

He laughs, ""Hey, you still are to me."" Kate punches him in the shoulder, ""Ow, and let's add abusive to that list now.""

""Don't be a big baby!""

They enter the bakery, and are hit at once with the smells, permeating throughout the little establishment. They both try little samples that are laid out. ""Ooh, Castle, these are amazing, God each flavor is sinful. Babe, I think they did win the cupcake wars.""

""Yeah, I think they did too.""

They buy a dozen, plus one for each of them as they sit at a table with a large cup of coffee.

Kate reaches over to grab one of Castle's hands, and places within her palm. ""So, Castle, you want to tell me about this Dream or Alternate Universe you traveled too, that got you so amped up that you wanted to get married today? Not that I'm complaining, because I'm not.""

Castle sits and considers what he wants to divulge. After they had been together a while a couple of years ago, as they laid sated and sweaty after rounds of love making, they had gotten into a habit of talking about many of their misunderstandings, and mistakes that they had made that hurt the other one. It had been quite revealing at just how much they had missed their chances, just through a lack of communication most of the time.

One night Kate told him how sorry she was about her time at the cabin after the shooting and told him about her nightmares of him taking the bullet when he had dived for her. She had cried that night telling him how much he meant to her, and that she couldn't be without him, so telling her now that in his Alt World, this time he did take the bullet and died, could temporarily break her. He was not going to tell her on their wedding day if at all. Maybe, someday down the road.

""Kate, I don't want to get into all the details right now. Let's just say that it was an ugly world where both of us were failing at life without each other. You were as closed off as you were when we met. You didn't solve your mothers murder without me, so you viewed yourself as a failure as a Detective. As a Captain, you comprised things in order to get the best result, to get your closure rates up, instead finding the whole story, and as for me, I didn't write Nikki Heat, and I wrote some trash instead that sent me spiraling into the bimbo chasing asshole, that I was when we met. Alexis got tired of my bullshit, so she went to leave to be with her mother, if you can even believe that, and my mother came to live with me to help me pay my mortgage, because I apparently pissed away all of my money. So that's the short ugly version, and enough for now if that's okay?""

""Of course, Castle. I can't even get my head wrapped around what you've told me, though I could see me thinking I was a failure not solving my mother's murder, because I had felt that way off and on before. Maybe, later you can tell me the rest?""

""Sure Kate. I promise. I'll give you all the ugly details, but right now, how bout we head out Mrs. C to Be.

Kate laughs, ""Did you just quote PI Castle?""

Castle shrugs, ""Hey it's the only thing that hairy fruitarian ever said that was funny.""

Kate replies, ""You know, my Dad still can't look at a cranberry without wanting to run to the bathroom. That cranberry concoction that PI made at Thanksgiving last year, gave my Dad the runs all thru the night.""

Castle laughs, ""Yeah, Alexis was giving me the stink eye, daring me to not try that slop, so I took a big bite and made a nummy sound like I was enjoying it, all the time my gag reflex was being put to the ultimate test.""

As they get up to leave and grab their dozen cupcakes, Kate turns to Castle and smirks, ""You know, my Dad still gives me shit about that stupid Pocahontas costume you tricked my into wearing. I can't believe I fell for that""

As they walk out the door Castle replies, ""Yeah, but you didn't have to wear that John Rolfe pilgrim costume. That suit was seriously starched; it chaffed my private parts.""

Kate gave him a wicked smile, ""Didn't seem to hurt you at all later when I peeled it off of you.""

""The things I do for Love.""

""Ahh, you're such a martyr, and besides, it served you right for tricking me!""

A half hour later they were pulling into the driveway of the Hampton's house. Castle looked over at his soon to be wife. She still looked like she was waiting for the hammer to fall. Castle placed his hand gently on her thigh, ""It's okay Kate, we're here and everything is on schedule, and hey this time we don't even have to worry about your other husband.""

Kate shoots him a look, ""Really, you're bringing that up now?""

""Got you to relax, didn't I?""

Kate took a deep breathe, ""Yeah, you did, but mention his name again, and I will shoot you.""

Castle laughs, ""Ahh, nothing like being threatened with bodily harm before getting married. It's so us.""

Kate smiles at her goofy man, ""Come on Castle, let's go inside, I want to be Mrs. C. to Be!""

xxxxxxxxxxxxxx

They enter the foyer, and Kate sees her Dad, and she runs to him and gives him a big hug, ""Glad you could make it Dad.""

Jim Beckett says, ""No place I'd rather be Katie. Martha and Alexis are keeping the food warm from the caterers and getting the table set for later. Is there anything that you need me to do?""

Kate thumbs her hand over her shoulder and says, ""Make sure that you don't leave this guy out of your site."" As she hears Castle chuckle, "" I'm going to get ready so, maybe you could tell the girls to come into the bedroom when they have a second, just to see what they think of my outfit.""

""Sure Katie, I'll tell them."" Then he turns to Castle and says, ""Come on Son, let's get you all gussied up for your wedding debut.""

Kate heads off to the bathroom, takes a quick shower, but doesn't get her hair wet. She puts on her sexy lingerie, that she knows will drive Castle crazy, then puts on her bridal outfit. As she leaves the bathroom, both Martha and Alexis are standing there.

""Katherine, I swear you look as stunning as you did last time, oh and here are the earrings I gave you before. Do you still want to wear them?""

""Of course, Martha I would be honored. Do you really think this pants and blouse outfit works okay? I just couldn't bear to wear a dress this time.""

""Oh, darling you look fantastic,"" and Alexis adds, ""You look amazing Kate, and Dad just wants you up there, he probably won't even see anything but you anyway.""

Kate blushes, ""Thanks guys.""  Martha and Alexis help Kate with her hair, and as she looks in the mirror, the only thing she sees, is not the outfit but just a woman helplessly in love, she turns to the girls and says, ""Okay, let's do this.""

xxxxxxxxxxx

Upstairs Jim watches as Castle applies the finishing touches to his ensemble. ""You're going to make a great husband Rick."" he says.

Castle turns to him with his head low, ""Jim, I'm so sorry about what happened. I would never leave Kate; she means everything to me.""

""Hey...Hey, that's enough of that. I never thought you left her at the altar, and when the papers and her friends would leave her in doubt, I constantly reminded her, that no man has ever fought so hard for a woman. That you've saved her life countless times, never left when she would run and hide, have always stood by her side. So, I don't want to hear another word about that. I'm proud to call you Son, and to be your Father-in-Law.""

Castle, his eyes misting with tears, ""Jim...I can't tell you what that means to me. You know...She's my always and forever, right?""

""Of course she is Son, how could she not be. Now let's get you downstairs before Katie paces a whole thru the floor.""

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Castle runs and kisses his Daughter and Mother, then shakes the hand of the waiting Pastor. He turns around, and his breathe leaves him as he sees his Kate starting to make her move down the path to where he waits. He stands there and thinks, that the Universe has started to right itself. How could it not be the Universe, or the Fates, maybe simply magic, something to explain how he one man could be so lucky to have Kate Beckett in his world and become his wife.

Kate starts to walk towards her future, and she sees a ruggedly handsome man waiting for her.  She laughs to herself and wants to go back in time to 7 years ago, when she was a broken woman, so hollow inside, and tell her that her everything was right in front of her. She just had to reach out for him. Her one and done, that's who that man is, and she can't wait.

As the wedding starts, Jim Beckett listens to their vows. He hears Katie say, ""When I was vulnerable you were strong,"" and he knows by the look on Rick's face, that there is a hidden meaning to it. Then he hears Rick say, ""The mystery of you is the one I want to spend the rest of my life exploring,"" and Jim knows by Katie's reaction that there is a memory there also. He hears Rick end with, ""Till death do us part,"" then he smiles and adds, ""And for the Time of Our Lives."" He hears the Pastor say, ""I now pronounce you man and wife,"" and he hears his baby girl giggle. ""Oh Jo... our Baby is getting married, and she's so happy"" As tears fall down his face he says, ""Wish you were her with me Jo...wish you were here.""

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Castle turns to his wife, ""My Wife,"" he thinks to himself. ""Mrs. Castle would you care to dance.""

Kate turns to her husband, ""My Husband,"" she thinks to herself. ""Looking slightly confused, she says, ""There's no music."" She watches as Castle takes his phone out, and it starts to play their wedding song, ""In My Veins."" Kate laughs, of course her crazy husband would never forget that, as she wraps her arms around his neck, and they sway to the music.

Castle feels his wife place her head against his ear, and the scent of cherries and vanilla linger over her skin, then her warm voice washes over his ear, like the warm winds that drift over the waves and she says, ""Its Perfect,"" and Castle smiles, fighting back the tears that want to come.

As the lover's dance, oblivious to anything else, 3 people stand and watch.

Martha sees Jim's tear-streaked face, ""Jim are you okay?""

""Yeah...Yeah Martha I'm fine, just thought of Johanna when they were doing their vows. You know, Jo was mischievous like Rick is, they would have been thick as thieves. They would have driven Katie crazy, Jo telling all her highs school year stories. I'm so glad that your son came into her life and made her realize that her life was worth living. She said that their talking about having kids. I barley dreamed she'd ever get married let alone being a Grampa.""

""Well, Alexis and I think the world of Katherine. She made my son grow up. Made him realize, that his good looks and charm weren't going to get it done with her. She demanded more, and he changed...For her.""

Martha looked at her watch and said, ""I think it's time to hit the feedbag,"" then yelled out to the still dancing couple, ""All right you two, time to stop the tango, and eat.""

Both yell out at the same time, ""Okay, be right there.""

As Jim, Martha and Alexis head inside It just leaves the two of them. ""So, Babe, has the Universe been righted. I know how much you believe in the Universe."" Kate thinks back to the 3 months he had been gone with his ex-wife, and didn't call, and they found him at a crime scene. He had told her that they needed to solve the case together, ""You don't want to let the universe down do you?"" he had said. God, how she had missed him, and she let him win the bet, just to have him back in her life. They couldn't be together back then, but she knew they would be someday.

Castle huffs, ""Don't make fun of the Universe Beckett, it's important stuff.""

""Oh, forgive oh spiritual one,"" She snickers. As they continue to dance, Kate's stomach rumbles.

""Mmm, seems someone is getting hungry."" he laughs.

Kate smacks Castle in the chest, ""Cupcakes are serious business Castle, it's time to take care of your woman.""

""So, Bossy.""

""You love it.""

""Yes, I do, but I love you more... Thank you, Kate, for saying yes to being my wife.""

""Thank you, Mr. Castle, for letting me make you mine. Now, I have it on good authority that a Handsomely Rugged man, has plans to wife me up bad, so we need to get to it.""

As they head down the path to the back door of the house, arms linked thru each other's Kate lays her head against Castle's shoulder. Castle turns and plants a kiss on her head, and he lets his face linger there.

""Castle,"" Kate asks, ""Are you sniffing me?""

Castle laughs, ""Yeah...I guess I am."" He turns her to face him, ""I just love you, Kate."" his eyes watering.

She smiles, ""My big sappy husband. It's one of the things that I most love about you...and you want to know what else?"" She takes her hands, and places them gently against his cheeks, as Castle turns into her caress, she looks up into his eyes and says, ""Crazy about you Castle...Always have... always will.""

The Pelicans have put up 120+ points in 4 of their last 5 outings, and the Timberwolves have dropped at least 119 in three straight (their last outing was also against the Pelicans…). And speaking of that matchup, these two squads ran up 291 points in their last meeting (wtf…). Everything about this spot screams offense. I’m rolling with the Over to cash.

1pe7xjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransLater/comments/1pe7xjn/haunted_houses/,Haunted houses,"Only I can see them,

The ghosts that linger here 

Yet in the living room. I still see her, 

Curled up in her chair..


The pile of books beside her 

Steam rising from the coffee in her cup

The Energy with which she embraced the day 

Long before the sun came up.



Weaving mohair into cinches.

At her desk, at the bottom of the stairs. 

She'd taken all her furniture. 

But I still see it there. 



Stirring a skillet on the stove. 

Another cowboy casserole,

 Biscuits on beans, beef and onions  

Simple and cheap,  but it kept a belly full.


In the pen behind the house

 her horse nuzzled against her cheek.
 
 Round and round and round they'd go

Till he learnt whatever she was trying to teach. 

On the couch she sits in a warm fleece

Conversation and a cup of tea

Her legs curled beneath her 

A warm smile behind the steam.



That's the last happy memory I have. 

There were no smiles after that 

Cuz that was the conversation

 that shattered all we had.



In the bedroom I see her crying 

Curled between the bed and the wall 

The way she wouldn't even look at me

Didn't want my touch at all



I see her at the table.  

Unconvinced I even cared 

Angry at the hand that life had dealt 

Angry that the world could be so unfair

 

She moved on and I didn't. 

Her friends say she's doing well.

She's traveled the world and full of smiles 

As for me, it's hard to tell. 



Truth be told, I'm barely hanging on 

 Daily haunted by the past 

And in this house whatever sunshine that I can find

Gets lost in the shadows of the past. 



Whatever joy I find in being me

Comes with the price tag of just how much she cost 

And whatever personal growth I might find 

Is dwarfed by what was lost 



  They tell me I should try to move on, 

 To find somebody new.

Yet each time I try it feels like cheating. 

And the guilt begins anew



Just how long can a heart stay broken?

Will it ever heal?

Or is the pain A curse with which I must live

The inevitable part of the deal 



And so I press on day by day 

Living, but far from alive 

Not really finding healing here

Wondering just what waits on the other side



And when that darkness finally comes
 
 Will I find peace or only endless pain?

Evidently, these are the questions I chose for myself 

Until my journeys end

People on this sub have accused me of being ND before but there are things that dont really fit the diagnoses. For one, I was actually pretty popular as a kid. I didnt really find it hard to make friends until I was in high school. In high school, I decided to go mute for 4 yrs straight but it was by choice. After that, I had alot of social anxiety but I was able to talk to others in college no problem. 

Also I went to therapists and no one has recommended me for evaluation of neurodivergent. One therapist even told me that if you, then you are high functioning indicating it isnt even worth getting diagnosed. Lastly, I am very good at picking up on social cues. I never misunderstand people and can predict rejection before it happens. 

Because of this, I am extremely good at talking to patients as a med student. I even do good talking to complete strangers. I once cold approach a girl in a coffee shop just to practice talking to others. The convo went fine and she wanted to talk more, but I left it go. This is typically how it goes. 

But here is the issue and why I get jaded the older I get. I cannot connect with no one. So even if I get the date, a woman is going to say that I was cool but I dont know you. Even people in my class have said this about me so they dont feel comfortable sharing. I can't put my finger on it because even when I am vulnerable, people think I am complaining. I noticed that my convo get so serious and people especially women get offput my that. 

So I really struggle to make things light and playful. Like that is actually like hard for me. Even if I do it, I will revert back to being deep a day later. 

So what do I do?

The hot chocolate mix contains cocoa powder, cream powder, sweetener, salt, and bay nut powder. I have California Bay Laurel trees near me and learned that the nuts are edible a few years ago. I finally decided to try to harvest some this year. The trees produce berries with nuts that are said to taste like coffee/chocolate after roasting but to me, they taste like popcorn that is almost overcooked and lend a deep nutty, buttery, slightly bitter earthy flavor. I think it paired well with the chocolate and it was fun to try despite the effort of harvesting. I included a few photos of the process.

1pe7taz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hashimotos/comments/1pe7taz/aip_diet_where_to_begin/,AIP diet- where to begin?,"Hi all, 47/F newly dx'd with Hashimotos.  It's been a bumpy ride finally getting the diagnosis after almost 2 years since I was first diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism and dealing with fatigue ebb & flows, TSH levels in flux that were continuing to rise no matter how many times my dr increased my levo dosage.  On top of that- I'm in the throes of perimenopause and the symptoms btw hypo and peri overlap.  It's been a confusing time for me, to say the least.

I'm glad I finally got tested to determine I'm positive for autoimmune thyroid disease as it confirms a lot of suspicions I've had.  It seems like the lens is starting to come into focus a little more.  Along with being diagnosed for hashi's, I asked my dr to order celiac testing as I suspect I may have it.  Waiting on the test results now.  Still eating gluten.

I have tried to live a healthy life- eating a balanced diet of whole foods- lots of veggies & fruits & good sources of protein & fiber.  I try not to eat much sugar, drink alcohol, but I do partake in the occasional indulgence.  Food is a source of joy for me, but in moderation.  I walk about 25 min daily and do 30 min strength training 3-4 times a week.

On top of trying to live a healthy life, I'm a busy mom, but the symptoms of peri and hypo/Hashis have really taken a toll on me in the last few years.  I've gotten sick so often- sinusitis colds every 3 months while my family is completely fine and I caught the dreaded norovirus last Feb.  As I'm reflecting upon all of these maladies I've experienced- the Hashi's diagnosis makes complete sense and I feel like the norovirus did a number on my system that triggered some debilitating symptoms this past year.

My gut is I need to work on my gut health.  When I was in my early 30s I did an elimination diet for fun (had no idea I'd go on to be diagnosed with Hashis later in life) that worked wonders on me- I lost 10 lbs and my acne-riddled skin cleared up.  I felt amazing after completing the 28 day course.  I can't seem to find the book I used to follow this diet, and it was not as restrictive as some of the AIP diets I've googled-- was able to eat a variety of veggies & fruits, fish, potatoes and goat cheese/ goat milk yogurt and organic oats & nuts on this diet, but eliminated everything else- tomatoes, sugar, soy, eggs, coffee, alcohol, sugar, red meat, chicken.

  
After I receive my celiac test results, I'd like to start on an AIP diet, but I need help finding one.  Can y'all point me in the direction of a  websites/books with a good plan?  Many thanks!",2,1764873133.0,Hashimotos,1,1.0,False
1pe7rv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningToBecome/comments/1pe7rv0/how_to_be_so_productive_it_feels_illegal_nobs/,How to be so productive it feels ILLEGAL (no-BS guide that actually works),"It’s wild how so many people around me are drowning in productivity “hacks” from TikTok and IG reels. Pomodoro timers, 5am wake-ups, Notion templates with 84 steps. But no real results. Just burnout and guilt.  

What I’ve noticed is that most of us are not lazy or unmotivated. We’re overwhelmed, distracted, and bombarded by bad advice. Our productivity killers are often invisible: decision fatigue, dopamine overload, poorly designed systems. The truth is, being ultra-productive is not about hustling harder. It’s about working smarter. With better energy management, focus design, and cognitive tools.

This post is a curated, research-based toolbox of the most powerful productivity frameworks I’ve found. From top books to podcasts to apps, the goal is to help you build a system so clean it feels illegal. Let’s go.

- bold = highlight  
- italic = extra context  
- nested bullets = resources/tips

---

- **Forget willpower. Design your environment for laziness-proof execution**
  
  - The book “Atomic Habits” by James Clear (NYT bestseller, over 15 million copies sold, backed by behavioral science) nails this: you don’t rise to your goals, you fall to your systems. His tip about “habit stacking” and “cue-based routines” is gold. 
  - Clear cites a University College London study showing it takes an average of 66 days to build a behavior into a habit, but only if your environment removes friction.
  - Clear all visual clutter. Place your gym shoes by the door. Block all social apps with 1-click tools (see below).

- **Use the 3-layer productivity model: Energy, Attention, Execution**
  
  - Taken from productivity coach Tiago Forte (author of “Building a Second Brain”). He says most people ignore “energy debt” when thinking about focus.  
  - Start by managing sleep, caffeine, and stimulus overload first. *Then* build workflows.
  - Optimize your peak focus hours and protect them with “focus rituals” (eg: deep work playlist, phone outside room, 90-min blocks).
  
- **Apps that made me terrifyingly focused**
  
  - 🧠 **Motion** , An AI calendar and task manager that literally auto-replans your schedule in real time based on priorities. I’ve tested a lot. This one is next level. It combines to-do + calendar + time blocking. The productivity-nerd community calls it “Notion on steroids.” Great for ADHD brains too.
  
  - 🔒 **Freedom** , Blocks distracting websites/apps across all your devices. Unlike Screen Time, it’s hard to disable. Set recurring focus sessions. Game-changer during deep work hours.
  
  - 🎧 **BeFreed** ,An AI-powered learning app built by a team from Columbia University and Google, recently went viral on X (1M+ views). It turns top books, expert interviews, and research papers into personalized podcast lessons. I use it during walks or while commuting, just type in what you want to learn (like decision-making or focus rituals), and it builds a podcast plan tailored to your goals. 

    The best part? You can adjust the voice and tone (I use the chill female voice in deep dive mode), and it’s got an avatar called Freedia that makes the learning experience way more engaging. It’s helped me replace doomscrolling with real insights, and I’ve actually finished more deep content in a week than I used to in a month.

  - ⏱ **Toggl Track** , A simple, beautiful time tracker. Helps you become aware of time leaks (you’ll be shocked how much time goes into “misc internet stuff”). Helps you spot patterns and reallocate time with intention. 

- **Podcasts that slap (and actually teach useful frameworks)**
  
  - 🎙️ **Deep Questions with Cal Newport** , He’s the OG of deep work. Author of “Digital Minimalism” and professor of computer science. His podcast dives deep into distraction detox, focus rituals, and how to work like a craftsman in a chaotic world.
  
  - 🎙️ **The Tim Ferriss Show**, A classic. But skip the generic episodes. Look for ones with James Clear, BJ Fogg, Naval Ravikant. Those ones reveal behind-the-scenes routines of ultra-performers.
  
  - 🎙️ **Huberman Lab (Productivity Edition)** , Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman breaks down how dopamine, sunlight, cold exposure, and physical states influence focus and output. His episode on “how to increase motivation” is a must-listen (spoiler: it’s not about discipline). 

- **This book rewired how I think about TIME (best productivity book I’ve ever read)**

  - 📚 ""4,000 Weeks: Time Management for Mortals"" by Oliver Burkeman.  
    - This isn’t your typical productivity bro book. It’s philosophical, raw, and brutally honest. The title refers to how short life actually is (4,000 weeks = average human lifespan). 
    - Burkeman is a former productivity columnist who gave it all up to write this one powerful book. 
    - It flipped my mindset from “how can I do more?” to “what actually matters?”. A must-read if you tend to over-optimize and under-live. 
    - This book will make you question everything you think you know about productivity. And that’s the point.

- **Youtubers who teach actual productivity science, not toxic hustle culture**

  - 📺 Ali Abdaal , A Harvard-trained doctor turned productivity educator. His “Evidence-Based Productivity” series is packed with actionable insights from research. He explains the productivity system used by ultra-effective people with calm, no-fluff delivery.
  
  - 📺 Matt D’Avella , Minimalist filmmaker with beautifully shot content. He’s interviewed Cal Newport, James Clear, and other thought leaders. Start with his video “The Most Productive Month of My Life” for system-building inspiration.
  
  - 📺 Thomas Frank , Former student productivity YouTuber turned systems builder. Great tutorials on task management, Notion setups, and time blocking.

- **Productivity techniques that actually work (not trending gimmicks)**

  - ✅ “Time Blocking” instead of to-do lists: From Cal Newport's Deep Work method. Assign every task a specific time slot. Feels weird at first but forces clarity. Multiple studies (like from the American Psychological Association) suggest we vastly underestimate how long tasks take. Time blocking self-corrects this.
  
  - ✅ “Daily Highlight” from Jake Knapp’s “Make Time”: Pick just ONE thing that matters most today. Simple but devastatingly effective. Keeps momentum going without burnout.

  - ✅ “Second Brain” system from Tiago Forte: Organize all your notes, ideas, and bookmarks in a digital system (Notion, Evernote, etc) so your brain stops trying to keep track of everything. Proven to reduce decision fatigue and overwhelm. 

- **Bonus: tiny tweaks that give major productivity ROI**

  - Drink water before coffee. According to Stanford neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman, dehydration kills alertness. Caffeine hits harder when you’re properly hydrated.
  
  - Walk for 10 minutes after lunch. Boosts afternoon energy by getting blood flowing. A University of Georgia study found even light walking improves working memory and alertness.
  
  - Write your next day's “top 3 tasks” the night before. Gives your brain a runway for the next morning. Saves you from decision overload right after waking up.

---

If you ever feel like everyone else is productive except you, remember: most people are struggling behind the scenes. The difference between flailing and focused often comes down to systems, not willpower. The good news is that systems can be built by anyone.

1pe7rbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1pe7rbb/drama_at_the_dunkin/,Drama at the Dunkin,"This happened this morning and, while not the end of the world, it's still on my mind hours later. 

I go to the same Dunkin Donuts most mornings after I get off the train for work. It's usually boring. It's a coffee shop, for god's sake. Today, though, I walked in just in time to witness the middle of a loud argument between a customer and one of the baristas. Customer is early to mid 20s, and she looks like a college student (we're near a campus, so that's not a surprise). Barista is this middle-aged woman who clearly is not paid enough to put up with this shit. There's four other people inside, waiting in line in front of the cashier, plus me. The customer isn't on the cashier line, she's on the other side of the counter where people pick up their orders. 

Anyway, the customer is legitimately *screaming* at the barista that she wants what she ordered on the app, not a replacement item. The barista tells her (for what sounds like the umpteenth time) that sometimes the app shows items that individual stores don't actually carry, and she's sorry for the inconvenience but she's happy to replace what the girl ordered (for free, in case that wasn't obvious). 

For what it's worth, I've ordered ahead with the Dunkin app before and had this happen to me, where I order an item but the store doesn't actually have it in stock. It takes two seconds to say, ""that's okay, I'll have a \[insert baked good of choice here\] instead"" and be done with it. 

I guess this girl is too special for a replacement donut. She wants exactly what she ordered and she's not leaving until she has it, goddamnit. There's a bit of unintelligible arguing over each other for a bit before the girl finally yells, ""Get me what I ordered and do your job, bitch!"" 

The older woman at the front of the cashier line immediately snaps, ""Hey!"" in the barista's defense, which isn't the most dramatic interruption, but it was enough to startle the girl into immediately shutting up and leaving the store (but not before slamming the door hard enough that I genuinely thought the glass cracked). Guess she thought she was being all big and bad until she realized her audience wasn't on her side. I was worried the barista would be upset after that, but she just looked exhausted, and we all kind of commiserated with her for a moment and reassured her that yes, that girl was, in fact, nuts. 

Anyway, that was around 9 this morning. I hope the rest of the barista's day was better, and I hope that customer trips into an open manhole. ",130,1764873018.0,EntitledPeople,23,1.0,False

1pe7nf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pe7nf0/a_year_sober_my_reflection/,A year sober. My reflection.,"Wow, it’s here! I made it a year and plan to continue my sobriety for, well, forever. Granted that’s daunting, so one day at a time stays the motto. 

Nothing catastrophic happened to lead to my sudden sobriety. I was just showing some health signs of needing to stop and I was exhausted by the cycle and living in constant fear of being caught. 

However, let me make this clear - I wasn’t at rock bottom. My rock bottom(s) came and went in a vicious cycle over the 15 years of my drinking career. 

I should have stopped sooner. Maybe after getting kicked off a super important work trip for screaming like a psychopath (and it was recorded!) at my boss’s wife and losing a job I was so excited to have. Or maybe after I slept with a married coworker on my birthday trip and played a massive role in ruining his life. Or maybe after I vomited on the bar at the wedding of a very close friend who begged me to stay sober for the reception. Or maybe after I jumped out of a moving car because I was sick of being lectured about my drinking (did this THREE times). Or maybe after I lost my hard earned career. It was never directly linked to my drinking (in conversations with me), but to think I was fooling anyone is laughable. Or maybe after I threatened suicide when I was postpartum and gaslighting my husband that it wasn’t alcohol - I’m just naturally that crazy. 

The list goes on and on and on. So many embarassing moments, so many unnecessary fights (because I’m an angry drunk) and I’ve had a year to reflect on plenty of it. I’m sure there’s plenty more I don’t remember and was never told about. 

Now I’m present. I’m healthy. I’m less anxious. Less emotional. Never truly angry. My career is back up and running better than ever before. My relationship is truly perfect. My daughter is loved and doesn’t even know what it means for her mom to be drunk. I never became a “mommy, you need your wine?” mom. Instead, it’s “mommy, you need your coffee?” 

I’m proud of me today and I’m proud of everyone here. IWNDWYT. ",56,1764872776.0,stopdrinking,3,0.98,False

This happened on September 18, 2025.

It's strange because I woke up at 6 am as usual to go for a run and do some calisthenics, and everything was perfect, but by 7 pm everything changed drastically.



After having the most terrible experience, fainting and feeling like I was dying, today I'm a little better. I want to share a few points in case they help someone:

\-Doctors are very poorly trained to treat this condition.



\-Doctors will tell you that you have a lot of anxiety and that it was just an episode, and that you should take prescribed medication.



Colchicine made me feel very bad, but it did help my recovery.



\-Doctors will assure you that you can continue living your normal life and exercising.



\-I stopped all medication after 2 months because my muscles were trembling and I could barely get out of bed.



\-The colchicine caused me muscle damage that, after a month and a half, still hasn't healed.



\-Doctors assure me that colchicine has no side effects.



\-Nothing can help you in an emergency more than staying calm and relaxed.



\-Even spending all the money you have won't solve a flare-up; you just have to stay relaxed, breathe slowly, think positively, and be patient.



\-The first month is incredibly hard! I was short of breath after saying four words in a row and I felt extremely dizzy; sleeping was also a nightmare.



\-Bathing, brushing my teeth, and getting dressed were the most difficult challenges of my life.



\-Avoid sugar, coffee, fatty foods, alcohol, and smoking... you'll thank me later.



\-Protect your stomach from acidic foods.



\-The second month sees a significant decrease in symptoms, but you're not cured.



\-The third month makes you doubt whether you can improve further or if there's simply no progress. -Avoid anything that involves straining your chest or lifting heavy objects.



\-Do not combine anti-inflammatory herbs with the medication (especially CBD).



\-After 3 months, I walk a little and feel like my legs are going to give out because of the medication. I still have slight chest discomfort, but it's tolerable as long as I don't lift heavy things or strain my back/chest.



The most important thing is to maintain your mental health and accept that, for the moment, you have a very serious condition. Take good care of yourself, be patient, listen to your body, and don't experiment before 3 months have passed.



If you weren't familiar with meditation and prayer, now is the time to start.



I'm doing this with all my heart because this group has given me the knowledge I needed to understand what's happening to me. Something none of the 3 cardiologists I paid could do.

Chapter 2 — There's Something Deeply Wrong With My Brain

I did not sleep well that night. Hours of tossing and turning. Circling the event in my head, over and over. There’s no way that actually happened, right? This sort of stuff is from old books, and crazy women at church. This doesn’t actually happen.

I had to have had a seizure, or some sort of weird hallucination, perhaps from fever, but I don’t feel sick. I’m not hot, no chills. The scariest part is I feel lucid. It’s the only real possibility—something went wrong, something very wrong in my brain. Maybe a gas leak.

It didn’t matter how much I rationalized, sleep eluded me. The few moments I got, out of pure exhaustion, my dreams helped none.

I walked in rooms of mirrors. There was never anything in them… not even my own reflection, but I’ve never felt so watched, so inspected, so overwhelmingly under someone’s thumb. Eventually my alarm clock rang. I've always hated that thing, but this morning, it felt as if it were my rescuer, salvation from the torture of insomnia and nightmares. After the alarm faded, the quiet, the silence felt as if it were waiting.

The morning was odd. I wasn't exactly sure what I was feeling. I stumbled to the shower on autopilot, dropped my clothes, and bathed in the warmth of the water. Life is good, warmth is good. Exiting the shower, drying myself off, then beginning to brush my teeth… then the mirror.

I had almost, almost forgotten, yet approaching without thought, I began to sweat.

I froze for a moment. Panic swelling, breath increasing, feeling every muscle tighten, before I started laughing. I laughed as a man dying of thirst drank. Desperately, maniacally. My chest burned with the exertion.

God this really has gotten to me. It's just a mirror. I'm such a fool.

Alright, what’s next? Breakfast. That's right. Simple—eggs and toast, and definitely can't forget the coffee. Giver of life and vitality, waker of the downtrodden.

Slipping on my shoes, then heading out the door, feeling as if I can actually just live normally. Last night was just a weird experience, a bloop, a memory. Maybe a scary story I'll exaggerate and tell my kids one day, who knows, but part of me knew I was lying to myself.

When the bus finally arrived at the bus stop, I stepped in like any other day. A slight sigh, then putting a socially acceptable smile on my face, my average boring commute, to a night of flipping burgers.

The thing was someone jostled right in front of me, snatching my seat. I was just a mere moment from claiming it for myself.

“Excuse me…” I spoke barely audibly. I'm never one to make a scene. Can't this man just see he'd been rude, apologize, and let me have my seat?

Of course not. He ignored me.

I was going to just brush it off, take a standing spot, and go on with my day, but apparently I had other ideas. Arms down to my side, chin up in defiance, I moved—moved without thought, and spoke with even less.

“Hey buddy, you took my seat.”

“This is my seat. I'm sitting in it, ain't I?”

I felt a tinge of something—something almost primal. Insulted, but not in any way that came even close to make me feel any lesser. I crouched slightly, becoming eye to eye with this man.

“Do what's right. You know I was going to sit here. Do you really wanna cause a problem in a crowded bus? Protect your ego, get up.”

Something in my eyes must have made the message land. He stared into them, seeing what I saw—a man, a man who thought he was in control, but can now clearly see his position.

I had won. I never won… what just happened? Where did that come from… part of me knew, if it had led to it, I'd have hurt that man. I've never been in a fight, let alone over a seat.

Quick recap for anyone new:
My roommate got super drunk, tried to kiss me, I turned her down because she was wasted, then she hid from me for days out of embarrassment. Somehow everything turned around in less than a week and now we’re together.

(Full original post + previous updates here: https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/s/N1WyMis5Wp)

We told the roommates. They went crazy-happy, teasing us, cheering, the whole thing. She just stood there blushing into her coffee with the biggest smile she couldn’t hide.
Tuesday night — Mexican place by the river.
She knocked on my door looking unreal. I told her she was stunning (I am still shy saying stuff like that) and her face lit up like I’d given her the world. She said maybe this is the first I saw you complimenting something, haha.
Restaurant was packed because of the Christmas market, but we didn’t care. Tacos, margaritas, non-stop talking and laughing. After dinner we walked along the river again, found our quiet spot, sat wrapped in each other’s jackets, talked until the city was silent. She passed out on my shoulder and then I had to wake her up and went to our place.

Wednesday morning was free, so I asked if she wanted to watch a movie in my room. She said yes instantly.
Started some random film… it just lasted maybe ten minutes or 15 minutes. Then it was just cuddling, slow kisses, whispering until we fell asleep fully clothed. First unplanned sleepover.
Woke up with her head on my chest, hair everywhere, breathing soft against me. Lay there for a while just watching her sleep and feeling like the luckiest guy alive.
We’re taking the rest slow, no rush.
Probably going out again this weekend. Will keep you posted.
Still can’t believe the girl who was hiding from me a week ago is now the one I wake up holding.
