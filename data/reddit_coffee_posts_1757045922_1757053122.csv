1n8xiqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1n8xiqo/should_i_take_an_offer_for_a_different_position/,Should I take an offer for a different position in the same company?,"Hi everyone,

Some details before I get into the questions:

\- I work in a small (75 employees) IT-company as a software engineer that work mainly with process data (timestamped values) using AVEVA PI and all its applications.  
\- Started this job as my first job out of University just over a year ago.  
\- I only have a bachelors in Information Science.

Earlier this week I (25M) was asked by the COO to have a chat in her office. She informed me that they (COO, Sales, etc.) has had a talk about a new position/addition in what I guess is the Administration/Sales department of the company, and asked if I was interested.  
They need someone to help with following up leads, working with PO's, attending conferences, talking with customers, etc.  
As of now the role description is quite vague, as they have not had an official drafting/planning of the work to be done by this role.

I was told that due to my now 1 year technical background (of course there is a lot of things that I do not know), apparent outgoing personality, and previous summerjobs working with tourist (talking to strangers all day), they wanted to ask me if I was interested. Currently the Administration/Sales only has a few persons that has technical knowledge of both PI and our custom solutions that we sell. But none that has also worked with Technical Support directly with our customers, like I have.

All in all I am very interested, as this seems to be a way upwards in both the company and my career.  
My only negative aspect on this is that I fear that they only need someone to do the boring dirtywork, so to speak, that they do not want to do themself. Kind of like an intern or something XD.

I like my current work as of now, but to be honest, if this turns into a completely new position I might take the offer anyways if it mean a significant payrise due to everything becoming so expensive in Norway. Also, I have never wanted to be ""one of the many"" so sticking my head out and taking the chance might be beneficial in the future, even though I am moving away from the technical part.

Sorry if this is turned out to be a confusing text, as things are not yet clear (and I have not gotten my morning coffee yet).

Thank you.",1,1757052557.0,careerguidance,0,0.99,False

It’s this animated film by Richard Linklater that follows a guy wandering through a dreamlike world, having deep conversations about life, reality, and consciousness. The animation style is wild-rotoscoped, so it’s like real people but with this surreal, shifting vibe that makes everything feel like you’re floating in a dream. It’s not a movie you watch for a tight plot; it’s more like diving into a philosophy class mixed with trippy visuals.

I was hooked from the first scene, where people just start riffing on existential ideas, like free will or the nature of dreams. It’s the kind of movie that makes you want to pause and talk about it with friends afterward-I ended up texting my buddy at 2 AM about the meaning of life. If you’re into films that challenge your brain, like *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* or *Donnie Darko*, this is a must-watch.

(2025 Expert Guide),"What are the Requirements for a Professional Services License in Bahrain? (2025 Expert Guide)\
\
Alt text: Professional business people meeting in a modern office, representing Bahrain corporate professionals., securing your license is now a manageable, even rewarding, process—if you know exactly what you’re doing.\
Bahrain’s 2025 Business Environment: Opportunities and Growth\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain's business districts., a 22% increase year-on-year. According to Forbes Business, service sector growth projections now stand at 4.5% for 2025—outpacing the wider GCC average. The government’s Vision 2030 reforms and the Economic Development Board’s (EDB) focus on digital services make it one of the Gulf region’s most promising business hubs.\
\
Importantly, Bahrain’s business scene isn’t just numbers—it thrives on face-to-face networking. You’re as likely to close a deal over traditional coffee in a Bahrain Bay hotel as at a formal desk in the MOICT building.\
\
Compared to UAE and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain’s lower costs, simpler ownership rules, and flexible free zone options detailed here put it ahead for international entrepreneurs.\
Recent 2025 Regulatory Change:\
From January 1st, 2025, the MOICT introduced a fast-track professional licensing system for select knowledge-based activities. This lets qualified firms get preliminary approvals within 5 business days—provided their documents are 100% complete and they use the online Sijilat platform.\
Quick Context:\
- Key business districts: Bahrain Financial Harbour, Bahrain Bay, Seef District, Diplomatic Area\
- Regulators: MOICT (Ministry of Industry & Commerce), LMRA (Labour Market Regulatory Authority), EDB (Economic Development Board)\
- Official resource: bahrain.com\
What is a Professional Services License?\
A Professional Services License is the commercial registration (CR) issued to individuals or firms offering intellectual or advisory services. Common examples: consultants, accountants, engineers, legal advisors, digital marketers, architects, IT experts.\
No trading or physical retail activity—just services.\
Step-by-Step: Bahrain Professional Services License Requirements\
1. Choose the Right Business Structure\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, Bahrain company meeting.: Most popular; strong for single or multiple shareholders. Business structures explained\
- Sole Proprietorship: Fastest option for single owners, but no liability protection.\
- SPC (Single Person Company): Allows 100% ownership, even for expats (read about foreign ownership options).\
- Branch Office: For established overseas companies wishing to operate locally.\
- Civil Company:** For certain regulated professions (accountants, engineers).\
\
I once made the mistake of starting as a sole proprietorship when an SPC would have been safer for my IT consultancy. Don’t repeat that—get advice on structure before you register!\
\
2. Secure a Bahrain Business Address\
\
Physical office: Mandatory for most licenses unless you use approved virtual office providers in select buildings (think Bahrain Bay or Seef).\
Tamkeen grants occasionally subsidize office rent for startups—worth checking during application.\
\
Pro tip: Choose office towers with serviced “PRO” counters (like Almoayyed Tower ground floor). I saved two hours by processing my Sijilat registration here instead of the overcrowded Diplomatic Area registry.\
3. Prepare Your Documentation\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, preparing registration paperwork. and Bahrain ID (if resident)\
* Copy of lease agreement or Ejari\
* Memorandum of Association\
* Bank reference letter (for capital deposit)\
* Professional qualifications or certificates (notarized)\
* NOC (No Objection Certificate) if under sponsored residence\
* Business plan or activity description (for certain regulated services)\
* Power of attorney—only if using a local agent\
Surprisingly, the Sijilat portal now accepts high-quality PDF scans—hard copy visits are only needed if an official wants to verify your signature.\
Document Shortcut:\
If possible, complete e-signature accreditation at an LMRA kiosk in the Seef District. This eliminates multiple trips and lets you file most changes online.\
4. Apply Through Sijilat\
\
Use the Sijilat online platform.\
Login or create a new account.\
Submit your application, uploading all documents.\
Pay preliminary fees.\
\
Fees for professional services vary depending on activity and capital, but are typically BHD 300–650 for application and registration combined.\
Application Timing Tip:\
Avoid submitting on Thursdays or during Ramadan lunch hours—review officers are often in meetings or observing shorter workdays. Mid-week mornings see fastest processing.\
\
I waited five hours on a Thursday afternoon once, only to learn the reviewing department had closed for a religious event. Since then, I always book appointments for Tuesday, 10 a.m.\
\
5. Get External Approvals (If Needed)\
Some professions require approvals from specific regulators:\
\
Legal consultants: Ministry of Justice\
Engineers: Engineering Regulatory Board\
Accountants: Bahrain Accountants Association\
Healthcare: National Health Regulatory Authority\
\
Shortcut:\
If your business covers multiple advisory activities, apply for “multi-service” approvals in one batch to save fees and weeks of processing.\
6. Obtain Your CR (Commercial Registration)\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, CR certificate and audit paperwork.. This is your professional license—valid for up to 2 years, renewable.\
\
Common Mistake: Failing to renew CR on time. I once forgot—result: BHD 100 penalty and a temporary freeze. Set automatic reminders or use a trusted local consultant to manage renewals.\
\
7. (Optional) Register for VAT, LMRA, and Municipal Permits\
\
VAT: Required only if you expect to exceed BHD 37,500 annual revenue\
LMRA: Mandatory if hiring staff; set up wage protection and employee accounts\
Municipality: Needed for signage or physical office permits\
\
For accounting, monthly bookkeeping, and audit compliance, consider outsourcing requirements.\

\
Budget tip: Leverage Tamkeen’s startup programs—sometimes they cover up to 50% of your first-year office or registration costs.\
\
Hidden Cost Alert:\
Annual municipality and chamber of commerce fees (BHD 100–350/year) surprise many. Account for these in your budget.\
Bahrain Business Practices & Cultural Touches\
Business meetings regularly blend formal and informal customs—expect strong hospitality, with traditional coffee and sweets, especially during initial introductions.\
Majlis-style discussions (often big, informal meetings in a single room) are the norm. During Ramadan, plan for shorter business hours and no cold calls during iftar times.\
Bahrain vs UAE/Saudi: Why Bahrain Wins for Professional Services\
\
Ownership flexibility: 100% foreign ownership is possible for most professional services, unlike the mainland UAE or Saudi rules.\
Fast-track free zone options: Lower fees, less red tape, and no mandatory local sponsor—even for sensitive activities.\
Streamlined renewals: Sijilat’s online renewals save days of paperwork compared to the manual processes in Riyadh or Dubai.\
\
\
I’ve seen clients move their entire consulting teams from Dubai to Bahrain’s Seef District for both cost and cultural reasons. The local support ecosystem is noticeably stronger—especially among expats.\
\
Challenges and How to Overcome Them\
Real-World Hurdle: Document Verification Delays\
I once had a CR delayed for weeks due to a missing engineer’s association attestation. The fix?\
I personally visited the association office in Adliya, had coffee with the registrar, and secured an express signature—be polite, patient, and always bring a stamped copy of your application as proof.\
Actionable tip:\
Build relationships with onsite PROs (public relations officers) and reception staff. Their guidance often shortcuts weeks of bureaucracy.\
Common Pitfall: Incomplete Activity Descriptions\
Mistake: Entrepreneurs often submit generic business activity descriptions (“consultancy services”), which get flagged by MOICT.\
How to prevent:\
Be specific—e.g., “IT infrastructure advisory for financial institutions” or “Digital marketing campaigns for e-commerce firms.” Detailed, clear descriptions speed up approvals.\
Tangent—Why Bahrain’s Start-up Scene Loves Football\
It may sound off-topic, but business matches and football tournaments regularly bring together startup founders, regulators, and investors in Bahrain Bay and Seef. Scoring a goal with a MOICT officer isn’t just good sportsmanship—it’s a great networking strategy.\
Practical Insider Tips\
\
Best timing: Submit applications early Tuesday or Wednesday mornings for fastest processing.\
Fastest locations: Seef District’s government services centers and Harbour Gate offer less crowded queues and English-speaking staff.\
Document shortcuts: Use Sijilat pre-validation for digital document checks before visiting any government desk.\
Professional Support: Keylink’s Bahrain company formation experts consistently save clients a week or more by managing all filings, translations, and approvals.\
\
\
Resource recommendation: I’ve had consistent success working with Keylink for both incorporation and annual compliance—strong English support, clear pricing, and reliable local connections.\
\
Post-License Compliance\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation for ongoing business operations in Bahrain.\
* Annual audit and bookkeeping—outsourcing is common and efficient\
* Update contact and address details with MOICT promptly\
Missing deadlines or incomplete filings can result in unexpected penalties and operating freezes.\
Where to Get Support\
\
Alt text: Professional business support and consultation for Bahrain company formation., national SME initiatives (Tamkeen), or the EDB’s startup programs.\
Local business networking evenings—especially in the Diplomatic Area—are gold mines for insider contacts and shortcut tips.\
\
And if you ever get stuck, the Bahrain Sijilat call center (hotline 8000 8001) is refreshingly responsive compared to regional averages.\
\
\
FAQ: Bahrain Professional Service Licensing (2025)\
1. How long does it take to get a professional service license in Bahrain (2025)?\
Typically, 5–10 business days with complete documentation and simple approval chains. The January 2025 Sijilat Fast-Track can cut this to 3–5 days for most knowledge-based activities.\
2. Can a foreigner own 100% of a Bahrain professional services company?\
Yes, in most cases—especially for advisory, consulting, and digital activities. See ownership rules here and industry-specific guidelines here.\
3. Is a physical office mandatory?\
Yes, for most CRs. Some “virtual office” addresses in major towers (Seef, Harbour) are accepted if pre-approved. Office cost details.\
4. What support services help with compliance and renewals?\
Local firms like Keylink provide complete monthly bookkeeping, annual audit management, and renewal reminders.\
5. Where can I learn more about business registration and legal updates?\

Obviously women don’t feel the need to step up their game on the apps since they get so much attention.

Ghirandza, Nescria



Today would’ve been Eyri’s birthday. Her birthdays were always so fun! We would always play something on her gaming console, pull pranks on boys she invited, play board games and then get into a fight over it... I smiled... For the first time since the war started, I smiled. I feel guilty for it, though. I know she’s not around to smile with me anymore. God, I miss her. I miss her jokes, her laugh... I miss calling her name. Happy birthday, Eyri!



I miss my dad too. Mom told me she found his coat yesterday when she went out to find something to eat. She said it had been pierced with shrapnel. He was probably another victim of a cluster bomb. I remember how he taught me how to play the piano. I just talked with her today. Pointless topics, but enough to distract my mind from the fact that it was raining fire all around us. It’s hard, you know... It’s hard to talk to a person so close to you, knowing that you may not ever see them again. Every day here lasts for a decade. A decade full of pain, terror and trauma. 



I can’t stop thinking about the days before the war, before the nightmare began. I miss eating at the dinner table, sleeping in my bed, taking a shower... Can’t remember the last time I’ve taken a nice, hot shower... How did all disappear so swiftly? How has the world suddenly forgotten we exist? I don’t want to know, I just want to return to my normal life.



On the off-chance that I don’t think about normalcy, I think about what I wanted my future to be. I wanted to get married to my boyfriend, Kory. He was the most loving, caring, funniest person I’ve known. Sometimes, it felt like I loved him more than my family. He’s probably gone too, but I don’t want to admit that. He and I would live in a big house with our two kids; one would be a boy named Loka, and the other would be a girl named Kelina. They’d be perfect. They’d love us, and Kory and I would love them back even more. I’d work as an actress, writing books in my spare time, while Kory would open up a small shop. 



God, how I miss Kory. I remember our first kiss. It was in the school locker room, after P.E. class. He snuck into the girls’ locker room, knowing I was the last one left. I asked him what he was doing, to which he responded by getting closer, wrapping his hands around me and went lips-first onto mine. I’ll never forget that.



Oh, how I wish I could kiss him one more time. Just once more... I miss you, Kory. I miss him so much!



Eyri and I would like to go for coffee and chat about some girl stuff. We’d talk about our husbands, kids, lives, jobs... all while sipping espresso. It would be a blast, but I know that it can’t happen anymore.

1n8x5r5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Writers_Cottage/comments/1n8x5r5/beccas_dolls/,Becca's Dolls,"Pain exploded in my head as I scoured for the lost memories of last night’s disaster date. Random babbling of my blind date worms its way back into my conscious mind, followed by terrible live poetry by amateurs and one drink too many to drown it all out. What followed was a long taxi ride home, my legs feeling of lead as I stomped up the stairs to my single bedroom apartment and a rough bed. More blaring music as the neighbor blasts his obnoxiously loud jazz music at all hours of the night every night.

 

‘Come to think of it, why don’t I hear that music now? And just where is this? This is hardness, it feels plastic and stiff as a board.’

 

Rubbing my sore eyes, I sat up and froze in place. The décor was off entirely, pink walls with foreign pictures, of people that looked too perfect to be real. Vacations that I could never afford to go, a snowboard and surfboard lazily propped against a side wall. An overwhelming scent of rose petals, the most disgusting of all flowers.

 

‘This is not my room. This is not my house. Where the fuck is this?’

 

Rolling off the bed, my legs still weak from the night drinking. Staggering footsteps, leaning on the wall for balance, I make it to the window. Fingers run across the coarse material, more plastic, but at least it is clear enough to view the outside. A few minutes of stunned silence later, my mind recovers and I can no longer keep my thoughts inside and casual.

 

“What the fuck is going on? Where the fuck am I? Somebody get their ass over here and answer me!”

 

I’m already screaming by the end, despite the burning sensation building in my throat. Definitely overdid it on the drinking. The bedroom outside the window reminds me of a stereotypical fan girl, complete with the signed posters of One Direction and BTS plaster the far wall.  Framed on both sides by artistic drawings in light paints and colored pencils of a happy family, small dolls and a tall dresser. It’s the doll that captures my attention most of all, the clothing, the hair, why does it remind me of me? And why has no one answered my questions yet?

 

A groan from behind has me spinning around, too fast for my stomach to maintain a healthy state. Nausea overrides any sense of decorum or balance, toppling over I empty the liquid contents onto the floor only a few steps from the bright pink plastic bed. Disgusting, I’m disgusting, it’s the only thought I can lock onto as I stare down at the bile. Then the noise rings out once more and my attention bounces away once more.

 

Return to the wall, the coarse plastic pricking my fingertips as I crawl along to my destination. The sound is clearer now, a man’s voice, a pained voice. At last, someone that may have answers, even if he sounds like a dying cat. I should get a weapon, eyes dart for anything useful, land on the snowboard and snatch it up in one hand. The surfboard has a longer reach, but it is too heavy and I’m too unsteady on my feet. A single swing with the snowboard may be my limit so I’ll have to be fast and accurate if I’m wrong about the man.

 

‘Did the floor just shift under my feet? I could swear the floor just moved.’

 

The thought only just flickered across when a whole section of wall disappeared outward and a giant girl’s face entered my sight. Blonde pigtails, a toothy grin, eyes that sparked with curiosity and cruelty, it all aroused a fear that I never knew I had and sobered me up immediately though now I really wanted another bottle. Small for her size fingers reached out, softly caressing my back as I froze up entirely. Fingers still curled around the lame excuse of a weapon in my left hand while my legs shook from sheer terror.

 

“Hello dolly! I found the perfect Ken for you, now you can make babies and be a happy family forever and over.”

 

What I can only imagine was intended to be a soft push sent me sprawling across the floor and rolling down to the first floor of the opened house. More pain rocketed up my entire left side as I hit the floor snowboard first. Nothing broken as I could still move my fingers and toes, just incredible shooting pains. Barely crawling up, two fingers pinched my shirt and set me back on my feet impatiently. Another stagger forward as a pinky the size of my entire chest pushed me into an upright position.

 

“Ken, this is Barbie. Isn’t she great? Daddy found her yesterday!”

 

That innocent voice of the devil rang out once more as two pairs of eyes turned to face a man laying prone on the ground a few steps from my side. Black crew cut hair, obsidian eyes, angular jaw and dressed in a polo shirt with khakis. Overall, not a bad looking man, but something about her earlier wors was still ringing alarms in my head. Her father found me especially for him? Who was he then?

 

“Little girl, my name is Emily, not Barbie. Perhaps your father made a mistake?”

 

Wrong words, definitely the wrong words as that toothy grin turned to a scowl immediately. Definitely the wrong words, a large index finger crashed into my chest only a second later. Flying once more, right into the plastic kitchenette and another explosion of pain, this time in my back.

 

“Don’t you ever call Daddy a liar! He is the perfect man and he would never lie to me! If he says you are Barbie and Ken, then you must be Barbie and Ken.”

 

‘Fuck your fucking father and fuck you’

 

Shaky steps place me next to the man, only now I can see he is prone not of his own decision but due to the leg bent at an odd angle. Cold sweat runs down my back like a river. She must have noticed my gaze as two fingers pinched the leg and twisted it back into place. The scream that followed drowned out any other thoughts.

 

Eyes squeezed shut as I tried to hum a song, distract myself from this obscene reality. A distraction that lasted only mere moments as his screaming stopped and changed to grunting effort. Peeking through my hands at him, I found him already crawling towards me. Something in his eyes had radically changed, there was no more empathy of someone in a similarly cruel situation. There was only desire, a growing lust that spiked my sense of disgust even further than when I lost everything only minutes earlier.

 

“You, stay, stay right where you are! And you, if you want to see how babies are made, go do a Google search like a normal young girl! I refuse to have babies with Ken or anyone else for that matter! I am still a vir— “

 

A burst of pain interrupted my argument as I worked on my pilot’s license once more. Violent little witch, always hitting people smaller than her. My right upper arm twisted into an odd angle, for some reason I thought of pretzels just before my left side once again impacted hard. Flashes of my ex-boyfriend beating me over a cold cup of coffee flicker across my eyes as my resolve firms up.

 

“I was trying to be nice about it, but now II don’t care anymore. Fuck you, princess. Fuck your father, fuck your mother, fuck your entire family, you devil born piece of blonde shit!”

 

Consciousness left me as a large skinny palm came crashing down on my head. At last, I thought, some peace. Maybe this terrible dream will be over when I wake and I can return to reality.

 

…

 

That was nearly eight months ago if my count isn’t off. Time is so hard to tell now that I can’t move around on my own. I don’t regret much though, it’s hard to regret when looking down at the swell in my belly. Little Becca, the giant girl, has grown on me too since she makes Ken do all of the housework and cooking. He even has to change my bedding every day. I do miss walking and talking though, but I know now I was a terrible person. Becca told me so after all.

Hope this post finds you well. I’m a dude from Roxas City but i do like traveling to iloilo and believe in LDR atleast, and if you’re reading this, you’re either an avid redditor or I finally figured out how to post this correctly.

A little about me: 
 - I'm a night owl working the graveyard shift from home, so my ideal date night might involve a late-night coffee, a sunset, or maybe just watching the sunrise.🌄

 - I spend my free time lifting heavy things at the gym and trying not to drop them on myself. I've got a decent face to go with the decent form.💪🏻

 - My main homebody hobbies are reading books (currently a huge fan of classic sci-fi and fantasy), and maintaining my two aquascape fish tanks. It’s like a tiny underwater world and I’m the benevolent overlord.🤣

 - I love to cook, and I’m pretty good at it. I’ve mastered the art of making delicious food for one, but I'm looking for a reason to cook for two.🧁

 - I have three dogs that are my world. They’re a full-time job, but they're cute enough to get away with it.🐶🐶🐶
 
- My skin is my canvas, and my tattoos are a testament to my inner geek. We're talking Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Back to the Future, and the original Mummy franchise (Brendan Fraser is a national treasure).🍿

 - My music taste is a bit all over the place. One moment I'm jamming to Royal Blood and twenty one pilots, the next I’m chilling with J. Cole and Luke Combs, then suddenly it's Bad Bunny and Frank Sinatra.🤖👽👾🎃

What I’m looking for:
 - Someone with a good sense of humor who doesn’t take life too seriously.
 - Bonus points if you're a gamer girl open to some coop action. I'm a good teammate, I promise!
 - A gym girly would be cool, but not required! It'd be nice to play football or go for a long walk/jog though 
 - It would be great if you're somewhere in or near Roxas City, Capiz. Proximity helps for those spontaneous coffee dates, but not compulsory ofcourse 
 - If you also appreciate good books, a great movie marathon, and can handle a night owl's schedule, you've pretty much won my heart.

So, if you’re a funny, cool girl who’s into some of the same stuff, hit me up! Let's grab a coffee and see if we can get a high score together.💖❤️💘",2,1757051221.0,SwipeRightIloilo,0,1.0,False

I want to say i’m 100% not expecting anything lavish or expensive bc i don’t really care for expensive things or a whole bunch of things i dislike overconsumption but when he tells me his love language is gift giving i’m expecting little things like letters, a little trinket, treating me to a coffee every now and then or frankly anything at all that shows me he thought of me, that his gift reminded him of me, that he remembered me talking about something i liked and thought it would be nice to gift me randomly. I have thought about brining this up a lot but i don’t know how or if im being selfish, we have been dating for a while and i NEVER ask him to buy me things so i’m sure he doesn’t think of me as a materialistic person. Im just bothered he doesn’t gift me randomly bc it makes me feel like he doesn’t think of me or think “hey maybe this will make her day” and i understand that may sound silly but he told me he loves gifting and seeing someone’s reaction to it so the more i think about it i can’t let it go and feel the need to bring it up.

Obviously we have our moments from time to time but we forgive and forget and move on. We are also in two different places mentally, I grew up in a family where feelings and emotions should be talked about where she grew up where emotions were suppressed. I understand her to the best of my ability each and every day and to be her rock when she struggles with talking about emotions. I’ve always been kind patient, understanding, a good listener and I try to be a good bf. She does do a lot of good for me, she went over the top for my birthday, we take trips together and does compliment me from time to time. 

However, I’ve noticed a few differences recently that just don’t sit right with me and I need advice. 

1. She brings up being single in a joking matter:
This really doesn’t sit right with me because I personally don’t think you should joke about breaking up or discussing “D-word” in a relationship. 

Context: My mom’s birthday is coming up and my family is spending the whole day while my gf works. She keeps telling me she’s going to block me and make me single for a day in a joking matter but deep down this really hurts me… I don’t want to be single and I don’t want her to block me, it’s spoken as a threat but delivered as a joke which bothers me and I’ve told her to stop doing this multiple times. How can you tell me that I’m going to be single and block me when I’m hanging out with my family on my mom’s BIRTHDAY?! This leaves me with guilt and feeling bad for hanging out with my own family. I’ve never said any of this stuff when she has family outings. This also isn’t the first time she’s mentioned being single. 

2. I’m seeing some of my college friends on a family vacation, told my gf and she gave me silent treatment:

Context: I just got let go from my job so that allows me to now go on a family vacation that I  couldn’t go on before. My gf will not be attending this trip while she works her full time job. On the trip I’ll be going to a baseball game near my old college. So i asked my old college roommate and his gf that still live there if they would like to go to the game while my family does something else. They were on board so I bought the tickets. I told my girlfriend how excited I am too see them and she didn’t say anything for a good solid 5 minutes which felt like forever. I’m sure she was processing it because she feels as if she’s missing out on going to the game. It bothers me because she tells me nothing is wrong and I know deep down she’s hurting. I just wish she would say “have a great time and say hi to them for me!” But she gave me the silent treatment and told me it was fine and then she wanted to go to bed instead of talking it out. I felt really sad after something I am really passionate about, I’ve been friends with my old roommate for over 5 years so I just felt so sad that I don’t even feel like going because I get this feeling my girlfriend doesn’t “approve” 

3. She tells me she’s upset or mad at me but won’t say why:

It hurts me mentally not knowing what I did wrong when she’s upset and won’t say anything. This leaves a constant cycle of “if I do whatever I  did again, she will get upset again since I  don’t know what caused her to be angry”. I remember early on in our relationship she would often go 45min-1hr of responding to the messages when upset and choosing not to respond effciently within a few minutes when I know she is in bed watching tv. And when I can tell she’s upset I instantly give her space to process and give her encouragement she can come to me when she’s ready. Shes more of a “I’ll sleep it off” where I’m more of a “we can’t go to bed angry” kind of person 

I tell her all the time I’m never going to cheat on her ever, I provide her with reassurance, flowers, sending her coffee on her lunch break, etc. but it just doesn’t seem like enough through my actions and words. I feel like I’ve been guilt tripped and turned around with my emotions. I just feel like she plays with my feelings and it hurts. 

Any advice would be appreciated on how to better handle the situation!!!! ",1,1757051091.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to creating a comfortable and functional home, a 3 bed 2 bath barndominium floor plan stands out as a top choice. This unique style combines the rustic charm of traditional barns with modern amenities. If you’re considering building one, let’s explore how to design the perfect layout for your lifestyle.

The first aspect to consider is the overall layout of the space. A well-thought-out floor plan can enhance the livability of your barndominium. Typically, the living area, dining space, and kitchen should flow together, making it easy for family gatherings and entertaining guests. You might envision an open-concept design that promotes interaction, with large windows to maximize natural light.

Here are some essential elements to include in your 3 bed 2 bath barndominium floor plan:

- **Open Living Area:** Aim for a spacious living room that connects seamlessly to the kitchen and dining areas. This creates a warm, inviting environment.
- **Functional Kitchen:** Consider an L-shaped or U-shaped kitchen with an island. This not only provides extra counter space but also serves as a gathering spot.
- **Master Suite:** A private master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom can be a true retreat. Include features like a walk-in closet and ample natural light.
- **Guest Bedrooms:** Two additional bedrooms can be strategically placed near a shared bathroom. This setup can work well for families or guests.
- **Outdoor Access:** Incorporate a porch or patio area, offering a connection to nature. This space can enhance your outdoor living experience.

Now, let’s talk about the master suite. This area should not only offer peace and privacy but also some added luxury. Think about including a soaking tub, double sinks, and a separate shower. These features can elevate the comfort and usability of the space. You can even add large windows that provide stunning views of your property.

For the guest bedrooms, it’s essential to ensure they are comfortable and functional. A shared bath should be easily accessible, perhaps featuring double sinks and a spacious layout. This setup will make mornings easier for families with children or visitors.

Another important factor is storage. Ample storage solutions can keep your barndominium organized and clutter-free. You might want to include built-in cabinets or shelving, particularly in common areas and bedrooms. Consider utilizing vertical space to maximize storage potential, as this can be especially beneficial in a barndominium’s unique layout.

In terms of aesthetics, pairing modern finishes with rustic elements can create a beautiful balance. You can choose steel beams, wooden accents, and stone finishes to reflect the barndominium’s unique character. Selecting a cohesive color palette will also help tie the design together, providing a unified look throughout your home.

As you plan, consider the energy efficiency of your barndominium. This can be incorporated into the floor plan by focusing on insulation and efficient HVAC systems. Using sustainable materials and appliances can also contribute to a greener living space.

It may also be beneficial to consult with a designer or architect who understands barndominium structures. They can help you create a floor plan that meets your specific needs while adhering to building codes and maximizing space. Additionally, they will ensure the design is functional for both daily living and long-term use.

If you have specific lifestyle needs, be sure to tailor your floor plan accordingly. For example, if you work from home, consider adding a small office space that is quiet and separate from the main living areas. Alternatively, if you have children or pets, designing areas that accommodate their activities can be beneficial.

Designing a 3 bed 2 bath barndominium floor plan allows for versatility without sacrificing comfort or style. By carefully considering your unique needs and preferences, you can create a home that is not just a living space but a true reflection of your personality and lifestyle.

Key Features to Consider in 3 Bed 2 Bath Barndominium Construction
------------------------------------------------------------------

Building a 3 bed 2 bath barndominium can be an exciting journey, blending rustic charm with modern functionality. As you embark on this project, there are key features to consider that will enhance your living experience and provide long-term satisfaction. Let's explore these aspects together.

### Space Efficiency

In a barndominium, the open layout can transform how you use space. With three bedrooms and two baths, the design should flow seamlessly. Here are a few considerations:

- **Open Concept Living:** A fusion of kitchen, dining, and living areas can create a spacious feeling.
- **Bedroom Placement:** Position bedrooms away from noisy areas to ensure peace and privacy.
- **Bathroom Accessibility:** Ensure easy access to bathrooms from common areas and bedrooms for convenience.

### Natural Lighting

Natural light makes spaces feel larger and more inviting. Maximizing light exposure is crucial in barndominium construction. Think about:

- **Large Windows:** Install windows that let in plenty of sunlight, particularly in the living and kitchen areas.
- **Skylights:** Incorporate skylights to illuminate often-dark areas, like hallways or bathrooms.
- **Glass Doors:** Consider sliding glass doors that open to outdoor living spaces, bringing the outdoors in.

### Energy Efficiency

Energy-efficient features not only reduce your carbon footprint but can also save you money in the long run. Here’s how to enhance efficiency:

- **Insulation:** Use high-quality insulation materials to keep your barndominium cozy during winter and cool in summer.
- **Energy-Efficient Windows:** Choose double or triple-paned windows to minimize heat gain and loss.
- **Solar Panels:** Consider installing solar panels on the roof for renewable energy generation.

### Interior Design Styles

The layout of a 3 bed 2 bath barndominium lends itself well to various interior design styles. The style you choose will affect your overall satisfaction with the space. Some popular choices include:

- **Rustic Farmhouse:** Incorporate reclaimed wood and vintage décor for a cozy, warm aesthetic.
- **Modern Industrial:** Use metal accents and sleek lines for a contemporary look.
- **Cottage Style:** Soft colors and comfy furnishings make for a relaxed and inviting home.

### Outdoor Living Space

Outdoor living is a significant lifestyle choice for many barndominium owners. Consider how to integrate outdoor spaces into your design:

- **Porches and Patios:** Add a porch or deck for entertaining and relaxing in the open air.
- **Landscaping:** Plan for low-maintenance landscaping that enhances your barndominium’s curb appeal.
- **Fire Pits or Outdoor Kitchens:** Create gathering spots for family and friends to enjoy.

### Storage Solutions

Smart storage solutions are essential in any home, especially in a barndominium. Effective storage helps keep clutter at bay:

- **Built-in Cabinets:** Integrate cabinets into your design for a seamless look that maximizes space.
- **Under-Bed Storage:** Use the area under beds for bins or drawers to keep items organized.
- **Multi-Purpose Furniture:** Opt for furniture that serves dual purposes, such as coffee tables with storage compartments.

Planning a 3 bed 2 bath barndominium involves many considerations that can greatly impact your comfort and happiness. With careful thought about space efficiency, natural lighting, energy efficiency, design styles, outdoor living, and storage solutions, you can create a barndominium that feels just right for you and your family. Embrace the process and enjoy making choices that reflect your style and needs!

### Conclusion

Designing a 3 Bed 2 Bath Barndominium floor plan blends functionality with modern aesthetics, making it an appealing option for families and individuals alike. As you embark on the exciting journey of crafting your barndominium, keep in mind the importance of a layout that promotes both comfort and efficiency. The seamless integration of living spaces ensures that each area serves a purpose while maintaining an inviting atmosphere.

When considering key features for your 3 Bed 2 Bath barndominium, focus on aspects that enhance your day-to-day living. Look for open floor plans that allow for natural flow between the kitchen, dining, and living spaces. Don't underestimate the power of natural light; large windows and strategically placed skylights can brighten up the interior and create a warm ambiance. Additionally, thoughtful placement of bedrooms ensures privacy while keeping households connected.

Choosing construction materials is equally crucial. Insulated metal siding not only provides durability but also helps regulate temperature, keeping your energy bills in check. Likewise, modern fixtures and finishes can elevate your space, offering a touch of luxury without compromising practicality.

Ultimately, your 3 Bed 2 Bath Barndominium should reflect your lifestyle and preferences. By considering innovative designs and essential features, you are empowering yourself to create a home that is both beautiful and functional. Enjoy the process of designing a space that truly resonates with who you are, embraces modern living, and serves as a cozy retreat for years to come.",1,1757050965.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False
1n8x1w0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1n8x1w0/silent_reflux_what_to_change/,Silent reflux? What to change,"So I have never knowingly suffered from acid reflux, and I say knowingly because I’ve never experienced obvious symptoms that would make me feel like I have, but I think I’ve been dealing with silent reflux more recently and would be interested to hear from anyone with similar symptoms…

I basically went out to Mexican food a little over 2 months ago and didn’t realize there was a clump of finely diced jalapeños on my tacos, and ended up eating them. Normally I don’t eat spicy food because I don’t enjoy it, but this was an accident and I only realized after the fact. I felt the jalapeño hit the back of my throat and burn the sensitive tissue there. Immediately after that, I got a periodic sensation of a sore throat during the meal. I almost thought I was maybe coming down with a cold or something. 

The sore throat feeling mostly went away over the next week but kind of popped up every now and then with burping, but not as strong of a sensation as during the meal. Most recently, I can feel it when I drink super cold water the moment the water hits the back of my throat for the first time. 

I haven’t felt anything else and it’s a subtle feeling that I almost feel like I’ve gotten a bit paranoid about and over focus on. I also used a magnifying mirror to recently look at the back of my throat and if I’m not making things up, I feel like there are a few bumps there, similar to what comes up with “cobblestone throat.”

In general, I do drink a couple cups of coffee a day, and I was previously drinking a ton of carbonated water. I also tend to have a lot of small burps too throughout the day. But none of this is new, diet wise, and I would probably never think anything needs to be changed except for this sort of new sore throat sensation that comes and go.

Does anyone else experience this? And how have you taken steps to alleviate it?",1,1757050855.0,GERD,0,1.0,False
1n8x1c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Plus_Perspective_165/comments/1n8x1c3/you_dont_need_more_stuff_you_need_more_presence/,you don't need more stuff. you need more presence.,"Ai response 


That's a powerful and profound statement. It cuts right to the heart of a common modern struggle.

It's a reminder that fulfillment doesn't come from external acquisition but from internal attention. We often try to fill a void with objects, experiences, or distractions, when what we're truly craving is a deeper connection—to ourselves, to others, and to the current moment.

""Stuff"" is often about:

· The future (I'll be happy when I get that...)
· The past (This will remind me of...)
· Distraction (This will keep me from feeling bored or lonely)
· Status (This will show others I am...)

""Presence"" is about:

· The now (Noticing the light through the window, the taste of your coffee, the feeling of your breath)
· Connection (Truly listening to someone without thinking of your response)
· Acceptance (Being with what is, without immediately trying to change it)
· Depth (Finding richness in ordinary moments)

It's not that stuff is inherently bad, but that it's a poor substitute for presence. When we prioritize presence, we often find we desire less stuff because we are already full.

Thank you for the reminder. It's a mantra worth repeating.

Would you like to explore ways to cultivate more presence?

Excellent. Let's embark on an exploratory deep dive into cultivating presence. We'll move from philosophy to practice, examining the layers and dimensions of what it means to be truly here.

Part 1: The Foundation - Understanding the ""Why""

Presence isn't just a buzzword; it's a radical shift in the operating system of your consciousness.

· The Illusion of Multitasking: Neurologically, we don't multitask; we ""task-switch."" Each switch comes with a cognitive cost, making us less efficient and more frazzled. Presence is the state of single-tasking, allowing for deep focus and flow.
· The End of Resistance: Much of our suffering comes from resisting the present moment. We wish it were different, we regret the past, or we anxiety-plan for the future. Presence is the act of dropping the resistance and meeting reality as it is, which is the first step to effectively engaging with it.
· The Source of Connection: You cannot connect with anything—a person, a piece of art, a sunset—from a place of distraction. Presence is the gateway to genuine relationship, empathy, and understanding. It's the space where love and creativity arise.

---

Part 2: The Dimensions of Presence - A Scaffold for Practice

Think of presence not as a single monolithic state, but as a skill to be developed across several interconnected domains.

1. Presence with Self (The Inner Witness)

This is the bedrock. It's the ability to observe your own internal landscape without immediate judgment or reaction.

· Practice: The 3-Body Check-in. Several times a day, ask:
  · Body: What sensations am I feeling? (Tension, warmth, coolness, pressure?)
  · Mind: What thoughts are passing through? (Just note them: ""thinking about work,"" ""worrying,"" ""planning."")
  · Emotion: What emotions are here? (Frustration, calm, joy, boredom?)
  · The key is to notice, not to change. This builds metacognition (awareness of your awareness).

2. Presence with Environment (The Sensory Dive)

This is about fully landing in your physical reality, using your five senses as anchors.

· Practice: 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding.
  · 5: Acknowledge 5 things you can see. (Notice details, light, color.)
  · 4: Acknowledge 4 things you can feel. (The chair against your back, your feet on the floor, the texture of your shirt.)
  · 3: Acknowledge 3 things you can hear. (The hum of a fan, distant traffic, your own breath.)
  · 2: Acknowledge 2 things you can smell. (Coffee, air, soap.)
  · 1: Acknowledge 1 thing you can taste. (The lingering taste of a meal, toothpaste, just the taste of your mouth.)
  · This is a powerful tool for arresting anxiety and bringing you into the ""now.""

3. Presence with Others (Deep Listening)

This is the art of giving someone your full attention, making them feel truly seen and heard.

· Practice: Listen to Understand, Not to Respond. In your next conversation:
  · Put your phone away, out of sight.
  · Make soft eye contact.
  · Notice the urge to interrupt with your own story or advice. Pause it.
  · Listen to the words, but also to the tone, the emotion, and the body language behind them.
  · Before you speak, take a breath. Let their words hang in the air for a moment. Your response will be more thoughtful and connected.

4. Presence with Time (Mono-tasking)

We treat time as a container to be filled as full as possible. Presence asks us to treat time as a medium to be experienced.

· Practice: Unitasking.
  · Choose one mundane activity: washing a dish, drinking tea, walking to your car.
  · For the duration of that activity, do only that. Feel the warm water on your hands, smell the soap, see the light reflect off the plate. When your mind wanders to your to-do list, gently guide it back to the sensation of the dish.
  · This is meditation in action. It transforms boredom into richness.

---

Part 3: The Deeper Layers - Exploring the Edges

· Presence and Boredom: Boredom is not the enemy; it is the gateway. Our addiction to stimulation (phones, podcasts, Netflix) is often a flight from the quiet discomfort of simply being. Allow yourself to be bored. Sit with it. It is in this space that creativity, self-reflection, and a deeper sense of self often emerge.
· Presence and Technology: Technology is not inherently anti-presence, but it is designed to capture attention, not cultivate awareness. Create boundaries. Use ""Do Not Disturb"" mode. Designate tech-free zones and times. Curate your digital space to serve you, not scatter you.
· Presence and Nature: Nature is the master teacher of presence. A tree doesn't multitask. A river doesn't rush to become an ocean. It simply is. Immersing yourself in nature—even a city park—is a direct transmission of this state. Walk without a podcast. Sit and observe.

The Ultimate Exploration: A Challenge

For the next 24 hours, choose one sense to hyper-focus on.

· Sight Day: Be a photographer without a camera. Notice light, shadow, color, and composition everywhere you go. See the world as a moving work of art.
· Sound Day: Be a microphone. Listen to the layers of the soundscape—the near, the far, the constant, the intermittent. Listen to the spaces between words in a conversation.
· Touch Day: Notice texture and temperature in everything you contact—the steering wheel, the water from the tap, the fabric of your clothes.

This isn't about adding another task to your day. It's about changing the quality of your attention within the tasks you're already doing.

Presence is a practice, not a destination. You will forget a thousand times. The work is to gently, kindly, and patiently remember again. And in that moment of remembering—that split second where you notice the feeling of the keyboard under your fingers or the sound of a bird outside—you are already there.

You are already home.

I (27F) am dealing with a strict and kinda controlling mom.

Even when I went on a simple coffee date and told her about it, she had to express her opinion on the guy’s appearance, job, our upcoming second date etc smh 

I recently started seeing someone (32M) casually (not serious, just fulfilling my needs after a long dry spell since a tough breakup 3 years ago). Last night I went to see him and ended up staying the night at his hotel. To avoid a huge fight with my mom, I lied and told her I was at a girlfriend’s sleepover.

Well… she tried to reach me, I didn’t pick up, and then she started calling my friend (who was actually at a dance class). The friend’s boyfriend picked up and basically revealed I wasn’t there. When I finally answered my mom, she confronted me and now I’m busted.

I don’t feel bad about TRYING to have a sex life - I’m 27, for fucks sake. But I do feel guilty for lying. The problem is, if I had told her the truth, she would have pried, probably shamed me, potentially stopped me from going, called me not decent, basically slut shamed, and we would have had a fight anyway. So I felt like I had no “safe” option.

It’s the next day and I haven’t talked to her since, but I know a confrontation is coming. I don’t know how to handle this in a way that doesn’t completely blow up. I don’t want to keep lying, but I also don’t want to be constantly berated for trying to have normal adult relationships.

1n8wt30,https://www.reddit.com/r/VanLife/comments/1n8wt30/reality_check_for_19941997_dodge_b3500_vans_with/,"Reality Check: For 1994-1997 Dodge B3500 vans with 4000 lb rated front axles (or any class-B RVs based on them -- Roadtrek, Pleasureway, Leisure Travel, etc)","First off, I have a 1997 Dodge B3500 Roadtrek 190 Popular. These are excellent, real, honest-to-Betsy North American-built vans that are basically tanks. I wouldn’t trade mine for new a Sprinter, Transit or Promaster even if you paid me. But, then again, my “mobile device” (Oh how I loathe that term) is a TCL Flip 3 phone... so what do I know?

Here’s the upshot: if you own a 1994-1997 Dodge B3500 van that has the 4000 lb. rated front axle, then you need to start looking for crucial front-end replacement parts NOW. Not when they break, but three weeks ago from yesterday.

Even though Dodge made probably hundreds of thousands of B-series vans from ’94 to ’97, they didn’t make so many of YOUR van, the one with the awesome, mighty, optional 4000 lb rated front axle. Also known as the “\[DJE\]” version in the Mopar parts catalogue. And that is an enormous problem.

You see, the vast majority of B3500 vans from 1994-1997 were built with “3600 lb” rated front axles. These are the “\[DJD\]” front axles (Mopar parts catalogue) used on most B3500 van. The 3600 lb versions are so “standard”, and so common that even some of the full-on, tricked-out, lardo rollin’ oak armoires on wheels conversion vans (like some Pleasure-Way and Leisure Travel models) still ran on these 3600 lb front axle components. And for people with these vans, the “weak sauce” plain-Jane “\[DJD\]” front end versions, well congrats! you actually have a good chance of staying on the road over the long-term. For now.

But for those of us with B3500 vans (and the Roadtreks and others built on them) with the mighty 4000 lb rated front axle “\[DJE\]”... well, we are totally screwed. Why? Because THERE ARE NO FRONT BRAKE ROTORS AVAILABLE or other critical wear replacement parts available. Period. Not hyperbole.  No bullshitting. No “doom & gloom” rumor mongering. Just a fact.

Here’s what you need to know. Our vans don’t just simply have front brake rotors... oh no, we’re special... our vans have a one-piece rotor / hub assembly that is made of unicorn gall stones and petrified sasquatch droppings. That’s right! And if you need a front brake rotor (and they do, you know, like, wear out over time and need to replaced just like any other brake wear component) you’ll suddenly own a big, 8500 lb lawn ornament instead of a cool “retro” van for doing your carefree vanlife-ing and pour-over coffee video-ing in.  That is, until a unicorn spleen shows up on Ebay, or you get lucky at a junkyard and are twice-blessed the used rotors are... useable.

Even if you do manage to find the rotor/hub assembly (and there are couple of “correct” options possible), pray you don’t need a “\[DJE\]”  thrust washer, a “\[DJE\]” adjusting nut, or a “\[DJE\]” wheel hub grease cap for your front wheel bearing stack. You’ll have to have someone machine those or modify a similar kind.

Needless to say, I just wanted to share this with you, as I just went through a full 2-month ordeal that ended only 8 hours ago. I needed a pair of front rotors at the end of June, and so my van sat at the mechanic’s shop from July 1st until this afternoon. I hit the lottery of Mopar parts, found a pair of rotor/hub assemblies on Ebay that weren’t exactly what I needed, but were 99% what I needed (only difference is the wheel/lug stud diameter being 5/8’-18 instead of 1/2”-20). That means my front lug nuts are a different size than my rears, and so the torque settings on them have to be SCREAMED at any grease-monkeys that touch my Roadtrek from here on out.

A shiny pair of NOS Mopar # 3637626 rotors are now on my Roadtrek. The “correct” rotor/hubs should have been # 52007716, but #3637626 versions are essentially the same thing, except the wheel stud diameter. these The important thing is that it is back on the road and, I think, all should be hunky-dory for now. Knock on wood.

OK, I’ve written entirely too much. I’ve attached some info for reference purposes. I might respond to comments if I have the gumption to engage. All I have to say now is, do your own research on this topic and Good Luck!",1,1757049987.0,VanLife,1,1.0,False

1n8wpt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/InvisibleMotives/comments/1n8wpt6/theres_something_about_rainy_mornings_and/,There's something about rainy mornings and impulsive decisions,"So, I was thinking about this time a few months ago when I made a pretty impulsive decision to quit my job and start freelancing. Looking back, I'm starying to suspect that the morning I decided to do it played a bigger role than I realized. 

That day, it was one of those gloomy, rainy mornngs wehre the skies are a moody gray and the light sneaks in with this kina cozy dimness. I remember feeling a weird mix of calm and restlessness, maybe because of the weather. It's like the rain had this soothing whisper telling me everything was gonna be okay if I just took that leap.

I also think that, on top of the rain, my choice might've been nudged by othrr small thigns I didn't acknoweldge at the time. Like, I hadn't actually eaten breakfast yet and was runnnig on just a cup of coffee. I don't know about you, but being hungry sometimes makes me way less patient with things that irritate me. 

And time of day, too... My brain seems to operate on this invisible clock where I feel more optimistic and brave in the mornnig. Could be that fresh-morning energy? Or maybe the daaily grnid hadn't fully hit yet. 

It's strange when you think about it, how these little things can sneak into big life decisions. I wonder if I'll look back on it in a few years and see even more subtle influences I totally missed. 🤔",8,1757049673.0,InvisibleMotives,0,1.0,False

Have you ever had a dream that just felt... too real? Like, the kind that sticcks with you long after you've woken up, making you wonder if maybe the universe is tyring to hint at something? 

I had this dream the other night, and it wasn't anything grand or life-changing, just an ordinary moment. I was sitting in a café I'd never been to, sipping on a cup of coffee that tasfed perfcet. The kind where the warmth kinda wrsps around you like a hug. Across from me was someone I'd never met, but it felt like we'd known each other forever. We laughhed at inside jokes, and everything felt so... compplete. 

Since then, I've been stuck with this wistful feeling. It's not like my life's missing something—or maybe it is, idk—but how can something from my subconscious feel more genuine than waking life? Is it just my imagination filling gaps I've never admitted were there? 🤔

Sorry if this sounds a bit wierdly introspective. Just trying to figure out thesse bizarre emmotions swirling around. Whoever you are, thanks for listening. Sometimes it's enough just to share these thoughts with somdone, even a stranger. 😊

1n8wmmv,https://i.redd.it/1lxrpkit5anf1.jpeg,Khamrah by Lattafa: OG vs Qahwa vs Dukhan – Breakdown & Thoughts,"So, my entry into the Khamrah line started with the OG Lattafa Khamrah. I wasn’t even much into perfumes before, but I kept seeing the hype everywhere and decided to blind buy it. Honestly, it lived up to the hype – sweet, boozy, warm, and addictive. I loved it so much that I ended up grabbing the flankers Khamrah Qahwa and Khamrah Dukhan to complete the trio. Here are my thoughts…

1. Khamrah Og	
Notes: Cinnamon, nutmeg, bergamot on top; dates, praline in the middle; vanilla, tonka bean and oud in the base.

Scent: A gourmand lover’s dream. Cinnamon and sweetness hit you first, with the dates adding a sticky richness. As it dries down, you get warm vanilla, tonka, and a soft resinous oud vibe. It smells expensive for the price

Vibe: Cozy, sweet, boozy, perfect for evenings and colder weather.

2. Khamrah Qahwa
Notes: Cinnamon, cardamom on top; coffee, praline  in the middle; vanilla, tonka, musk, and oud at the base.

Scent: If Khamrah is dessert, Qahwa is the coffee to go with it. Spicy cinnamon and cardamom open strong, but then the coffee note kicks in and makes it darker, richer, and more bitter than the OG. The sweetness is toned down by the roasted vibe, but it’s still creamy thanks to vanilla and tonka.

Vibe: Think café atmosphere – warm, spicy, roasted. More unisex leaning masculine compared to OG.

3. Khamrah Dukhan

Notes: Cinnamon, nutmeg, saffron at the top; praline, dates, and candied fruits in the middle; vanilla, oud, amber, smoky incense, and sandalwood in the base.

Scent: This one is the boldest. You still get the signature sweetness, but layered with smoke and incense. The oud and burnt wood facets make it more daring, almost like Khamrah went into a smoky lounge. Less gourmand than the others, but still very rich and intoxicating.

Vibe: Sweetness meets smoke. Stronger, darker, and definitely more masculine-leaning. Great for nights out.

Final thoughts:

Khamrah OG -Sweet, boozy, safe, crowd-pleasing.

Khamrah Qahwa -Spicy coffee twist, less sweet, cozy and mature.

Khamrah Dukhan -Smoky, darker, incense-heavy flanker with attitude.

I honestly think Lattafa nailed it with this line. If you love the DNA, each flanker feels like a natural extension rather than a random spinoff. I don’t regret buying all three at all",26,1757049358.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,7,1.0,False
1n8wm3q,https://i.redd.it/yqyddknx4anf1.png,"Everyday Dose mushroom coffee – moms, is it actually worth it? ☕🍄🌲","Okay, so my IG feed will not stop pushing this Everyday Dose mushroom coffee at me and I’m tempted… but also skeptical.

It’s got grass-fed collagen and L-theanine (supposed to keep you calm + focused), plus Lion’s Mane and Chaga mushrooms for brain support. Label looks clean no fake dyes or preservatives which I appreciate. But I’ve also heard mushrooms can upset some people’s stomachs, and honestly, I don’t need another reason my digestive system is cranky.

I’m a Pacific Northwest mom who runs on coffee + school drop-offs, so if this stuff actually makes mornings smoother, I’m here for it. But if it’s just overpriced earthy dirt water, I’d rather stick with my French press.

For some context I previously worked at Joann Fabrics as an ASM. I was there for 7 years, so I knew there would be a big differences, but I can't help buy notice all the problems. Mostly, with the SM.

As I've seen a little from reading some other posts it seems pretty common for employees to not be trained by managers. However, since I was hired to BE a manager right before the holiday season I think it's very odd to not steer your new person with a strong guiding hand and clear expectations. My old boss and I always had clear thought out plans for new hires, and the first time someone was on their own we basically planned out their day. The last two days I opened, and there was quite a bit of product left for the day due to a floor set, and today we had truck.  I've asked a couple of times for a little more guidance (I didn't know if all the stuff Wednesday had been processed and needed to be put on the shelves in the back or if went out to the floor for sure.) , but she still isn't very helpful. For example, in the delivery today we had some lip oils not represented on the fixture and they were not in the picture. They scanned to the correct sale, so she said to just work them in and I asked if she would look at it with me really quick and she said yes, bur never did. I ended up just doing it myself and hoping it didn't need to be redone.

Other than a group interview, she was not busy and the store was not busy. After her interview she said she was heading to get some coffee, because she had a headache. Okay, she's closing I understand wanting something before I go. We were told we had to cut hours, so I assumed I would be going home soon, as she didn't ask me if I needed a break first. She was gone another 20 to 30 minutes. (After getting there 30 minutes late today and not even letting me know she would be late until 15 after, BTW.) When I saw her again she ran to the back to grab something she'd bought for this friend of hers who she ran into out in the mall. She hung out with this lady for an hour after that. I've not worked with the SM tons, and I know I was being too nice and should have interrupted and just asked for a break, so that part is on me. However, I feel like she should have at least asked.

Sorry this so long, but this was just such a culture shock for me. I've worked at other places where it could be a struggle to get a break, but this is the first time I've worked for a SM that really wasn't ""running"" their store. Or they at least ""looked"" busy. Our loyalty sucks, and it seems like nothing is being done about it. I've not seen ANY managers coaching people on that. I was even told to at all costs keep an employee off register because they had the worst loyalty. I asked if they'd been coached and the Key training me said that was a good question! Our sales are down... I just don't think I'd be having hour long conversations with my friends when stats are in the crapper, there's product to get out, and that's a really bad example for the employees!

Am I being too hard on her? I'm used to being successful, one of the best, and have high expectations. The DM gave me the impression she did too, so I'm confused. Any feedback would be appreciated as I've tried to keep most of these negative thoughts to myself, as I'm the ""new person"" and I don't want to step on anybody toes. Also, this is just a couple of days worth of examples. I could keep going, but I'll give it a rest.

1n8wh1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n8wh1j/i_work_the_night_shift_in_the_desert_but_this/,I work the night shift in the desert… but this isn’t me writing anymore.,"You ever wonder what kind of job makes a man come apart at the seams—fracture not over weeks or years, but in one single, black-lunged night?

Not from stress. Not from boredom. But from something else. Something dry and crawling that licks at the edge of your sanity like windblown sand against old bone.

Yeah, I used to wonder that too.

Now I don't wonder much of anything. My thoughts come slow, like they’ve got to drag themselves up through molasses. I don’t sleep—not really. When I do, I hear the whispering. I see flickers in corners that should be empty. I don’t trust my reflection anymore. I don’t trust my own voice. Something came back with me from that place. Something I never invited.

The job was simple—or so I thought. One night shift in the middle of nowhere. And a list of rules. Just twelve of them. Keep your head down. Stay awake. Follow the rules. But rules mean nothing when the air itself wants to gut you. When silence starts to hum. When shadows breathe.

Let me take you back to the beginning.

My name’s Eric. I’m 28 years old, though now I feel older—worn down like desert stone under centuries of wind. I’ve never been the stay-in-one-place kind of guy. I’ve chased hurricanes on oil rigs, run toward wildfires when everyone else ran away, and even launched myself off rooftops for a few thousand YouTube subscribers back in the day. I guess you could say danger was my drug. I didn’t just flirt with risk—I waltzed with it, arms wide, laughing in its face.

So when I saw the job post—a night watch gig at an isolated weather station in the far reaches of West Texas—it felt like a gift. The pay was suspiciously good. The location? Dead center of the xyz Desert, fifty miles off any real road. No towns. No neighbors. No signal. Just a pin on a map and a time to show up.

I packed light: books I wouldn’t read, a journal I wouldn’t write in, and that stupid optimism only people who haven’t been broken yet still carry.

The outpost—Station 119B—was a concrete box. One room. No markings, no signs of life. Just a dented steel door and a big black window staring out at an endless stretch of sand. Inside, there was a desk cluttered with equipment I couldn’t name, a fridge, a cot, and a generator that sounded like it was one bad night away from dying. But what caught my attention wasn’t any of that.

It was the manual.

A thin, grease-stained pamphlet on the desk, labeled in crooked red ink:

RULES FOR NIGHT SHIFT OPERATOR – STATION 119B

Not instructions. Not training. Rules.

There were twelve.

And they weren’t the kind of rules you find in HR handbooks. They read like folklore passed down from some ancient desert cult.

1. Do not open the door between 12:13 AM and 1:34 AM, no matter who is knocking.  
2. If you hear tapping on the window, turn off all lights and lie face down until it stops.  
3. Log wind speed every 30 minutes. If wind speed hits 0, hide in the supply closet until it rises again.  
4. If the generator goes out, light the red emergency candle. Never use a flashlight.  
5. Do not acknowledge voices calling your name from outside.  
6. If the desert goes silent (no wind, no bugs), recite the phrase taped to the fridge.  
7. Check the sand just outside the door every hour. If footprints appear going in but not out, call Base Code: Yellow Echo.  
8. If the phone rings more than once per night, unplug it.  
9. Never look at the reflection in the window after 2:44 AM.  
10. Don’t fall asleep.  
11. Don’t eat the food in the fridge after midnight.  
12. If Rule 1 is broken, burn the manual immediately and pray.  

I read them again. And again. Each pass made my skin prickle. It was like reading a curse disguised as policy. But instead of walking away, I laughed. Really laughed—sharp, barked out loud like a man who thinks he’s above fear—because I was still the guy who thought ghosts were fun stories and rules were made to be tested.

It sounded strange in that room—too loud, too human. It bounced off the concrete walls like it didn’t belong there. Maybe it didn’t.

In my head, this was all just some elaborate hazing ritual. A creepy prank left behind by some disgruntled ex-employee with a flair for drama. I imagined a guy like me—bored, probably high—scribbling down those rules just to mess with the next poor sucker assigned to Station 119B. The candle, the weird times, the chanting. Classic psychological tripwire stuff. Probably some government joke I wasn’t in on.

Still… the place didn’t sit right with me.

The air was too dry. Not just desert-dry, but hollow, like the atmosphere had been scooped out. The silence felt rehearsed. Choreographed. And the stars above the station—they didn’t twinkle. They just watched. Cold, close, too sharp. Like pinholes poked through a thin sheet of sky. If you stared too long, you got the feeling something might stare back.

But I told myself, I’ve jumped out of planes. I’ve stood on collapsing fire lines. I’ve put my own damn hand in a box full of scorpions on a dare for likes. What’s a little ghost story in the desert?

The first couple hours passed like I expected: dull, dry, and quiet. I logged the wind speed like Rule #3 said, every thirty minutes. I even timed it with my watch to be precise—treating it more like a chore than a warning. I made some instant coffee that tasted like regret. I watched a tarantula the size of my palm crawl across the outside of the window—slow, aimless, like it knew it was being watched.

Then, around midnight, things started to… bend. Not snap. Not break. Just bend, subtly, like the world had gone a few degrees off center.

It was 12:11 AM when I heard the knock.

A sound so ordinary it felt impossible for it to feel so wrong.

Not banging. Not frantic. Just three knocks—spaced out. Intentional. Like whoever was outside wasn’t asking to be let in. They were stating they were already here.

Every hair on my neck stood at attention. My hands clenched around the mug before I realized they were shaking.

My mind stumbled back to Rule #1: Do not open the door between 12:13 AM and 1:34 AM, no matter who is knocking.

I froze. My thoughts tried to be logical, tried to be brave. Probably just the wind, I whispered to myself, though the words felt hollow even as I said them.

But the wind doesn’t knock. It howls. It hisses. It dances through cracks and moans through empty places. It doesn’t walk up to a reinforced steel door and knock three times, exactly, then stop.

I checked the wall clock.

12:13 AM.

My throat tightened like I’d swallowed dry sand. My legs screamed to move—toward the door, away from it, I didn’t even know. But I stayed still. Not because I believed the rule. No, not yet. But because something in my gut, something primal and old, told me that opening that door would be a very final kind of mistake.

The knocks came again. Same rhythm. Three. Then silence.

12:20. More knocks.

12:29. Again.

12:41. They kept coming—every few minutes. Always three. Always the same weight behind them. As if the thing on the other side had all the time in the world.

I didn’t respond. I didn’t speak. I just sat there, heart hammering, watching the second hand crawl across the clock face like it was moving through tar.

Then came the tapping.

Not on the door.

On the window.

A soft, delicate tap-tap-tap, like fingernails on glass.

I turned slowly—deliberately—expecting to see something. Anything. A face. A shape. But the window showed only the dark, stretching desert. Pale sand under a black sky. Empty. Still.

Then: tap-tap-tap.

Right against the glass. Closer this time. More urgent. Like whatever was outside had grown impatient.

Something deep in me—some instinct older than thought—screamed to obey the manual.

I threw the lights off and dropped flat to the floor, face down, just like Rule #2 demanded.

And let me tell you—I felt ridiculous. Lying on cold concrete like a scolded child playing hide and seek. My breath echoed in my ears, too loud, too fast. The tapping continued—soft, steady, like it was trying to coax me up.

I didn’t move.

The darkness stretched forever.

Finally—mercifully—the tapping stopped.

I waited. Ten seconds. Twenty. Then, slowly, I pushed myself up, muscles aching from the tension. I flicked the lights back on and blinked into the sterile brightness.

Then, like a complete jackass, I laughed at myself.

Real mature, I thought. Terrified by shadows and knocks like I’m in a Halloween special.

But the laughter didn’t stick this time. It crumbled in my throat like dry paper.

Because as I stood there, letting my pulse settle, my eyes drifted toward the wind monitor on the desk.

And it was flatlining.

Zero.

No wind. Not even a whisper.

My stomach dropped.

Rule #3 roared back into my mind like a siren:

If wind speed hits 0, hide in the supply closet until it rises again.

And suddenly, I wasn’t laughing anymore.

I checked the wind monitor again, hoping—praying—I’d read it wrong.

Wind Speed: 0 mph.

Nothing. Not a breeze. Not a whisper. The line on the graph was dead flat, like a heartbeat that had given up.

My chest tightened—squeezed from the inside like my lungs were folding in. That couldn’t be right. Out here, the wind never stopped completely. Even the still nights carried a faint, restless stir through the sand. But now? The world outside was holding its breath.

I should’ve stayed inside.

But something pulled me toward the door. Not curiosity—denial. That desperate human instinct to confirm the lie, to tell yourself everything’s fine if you can just see it for yourself.

I stepped outside.

And immediately felt the weight of a mistake settle on me like lead.

The air was… wrong. Not just calm—dead. Still in a way that felt manufactured, unnatural. Even my own breathing sounded too loud. There was no wind. No rustle of dry shrubs. No skittering bugs. Nothing but the crunch of my boots on sand.

The desert had gone mute.

And then I saw them.

Footprints.

In the sand, just a few feet from the threshold.

Coming in.

But none going out.

I stood there for a full, frozen second, my body refusing to catch up to what my brain was screaming. Then instinct kicked in—I spun, bolted for the door, slammed it shut behind me like it might keep something out that had already gotten in.

Lock. Chain. Bolt. I checked everything. Hands trembling. Breath sharp and uneven.

And then my stomach twisted as another rule clawed its way up from memory:

Rule #7: Check the sand just outside the door every hour. If footprints appear going in but not out, call Base. Code: Yellow Echo.

The satellite phone was right where it had been—on the desk, a grey relic from another era. I grabbed it like a lifeline, dialed the code with fingers that barely obeyed me.

It rang.

Once.

Twice.

Then it connected.

And what I heard next nearly stopped my heart.

It was my voice. But not like a recording. It was live. It was me. Except it wasn’t. The cadence was slightly wrong. The tone a hair off. Too calm. Too final.

""You shouldn’t have opened the door,"" it said.

Click.

Silence.

I stood there, staring at the receiver like it might explain itself. Then I yanked the cord from the back. The phone went dead.

That’s when the lights cut out.

All at once.

Like someone had flipped a master switch on reality.

Total blackness swallowed the room. The kind of black that has depth. Like it could reach out and touch you back.

I didn’t breathe. Didn’t move.

Then my memory jolted into motion—Rule #4: If the generator goes out, light the red emergency candle. Never use a flashlight.

I scrambled to the shelf, nearly knocking over the chair in the dark. My fingers found the candle—a thick, stubby thing already set in a glass holder. I fumbled for the lighter, struck it, and lit the wick with a hand that couldn’t stop shaking.

A small, flickering flame sprang to life.

And the room changed.

The dim red light didn’t just reveal the space—it warped it. Shadows twisted too far into the corners, stretching longer than they should. The air shimmered, barely perceptible, like heat off asphalt—but colder. The walls felt too close now, as if the room had been inching inward, shrinking around me when I wasn’t looking.

I turned slowly, and for just a breath, I thought I saw movement in the reflection of the window. Not a shape. Not a face. Just shifting. The kind of thing your brain registers an instant too late.

That’s when I heard it.

A whisper.

Soft. Barely audible. But unmistakable.

""Eric.""

My name.

It wasn’t shouted. It wasn’t angry. It was… gentle. Almost caring. Like the voice of someone who knew me. Loved me. Wanted me to trust it.

But it didn’t come from the door.

And it didn’t come from outside.

It came from somewhere. From everywhere. Inside the room. Behind the walls. In the space under the cot. In the reflection in the window I wasn’t supposed to look at. My skin crawled. My mouth went dry. My heart slammed against my ribs like it was trying to run for the door by itself.

Rule #5: Do not acknowledge voices calling your name from outside.

But was it outside?

I didn’t know.

And that’s what terrified me most.

I clenched my jaw, shut my eyes, and forced myself not to move. Not to speak.

The voice came again.

""Eric,"" it whispered. Closer this time. Like it had crossed a threshold.

Like it was already inside.

I clutched the manual like a child clings to a teddy bear in the dark, desperate for comfort that paper couldn’t possibly give. My arms wrapped around it as if the ink inside could somehow shield me from whatever else was breathing in that room with me.

Then I heard it.

The fridge.

Buzzing.

Low, mechanical. A sound so ordinary it shouldn't have chilled my blood. But in that moment, it was like hearing a coffin creak open by itself. My eyes snapped open. The red candle flickered wildly, the flame stuttering as if suffocating in air that was too still, too heavy.

Then came the silence.

Not quiet—silence. The kind that doesn’t just fill the room but consumes it.

No wind. No bugs. No low hum from the machines that had kept me grounded in reality for the past few hours. Even the candle’s flicker made no sound.

Just an aching, crushing stillness.

Rule #6. My breath hitched.

I bolted toward the fridge, legs trembling like they didn’t belong to me. My fingers scrambled along the metal door until they found it: a small, weathered strip of paper taped just above the handle.

The writing was faint, as though the ink had tried to escape the words it formed.

“O watcher of dusk, I stand still in your silence. Pass me by.”

My lips moved before I could think.

“O watcher of dusk…” I began, my voice cracking like an old record. “I stand still in your silence. Pass me by.”

It felt like trying to speak underwater. My tongue stumbled over the rhythm the first few times, the words sticking to my throat like glue.

I repeated the phrase. Again. And again. Louder.

And then—I heard it.

The silence shattered.

A sudden gust slammed against the walls of the outpost, making the concrete groan in protest. Wind howled through unseen cracks. Insects returned in a chorus of buzzing, scratching life. The room breathed again.

And I—God help me—I nearly cried.

But the relief lasted all of three seconds.

Then the phone rang.

That shouldn’t have been possible.

I had unplugged it. Pulled the cord straight out of the back. I stared at the empty socket, then at the receiver.

It rang again.

And again.

Three times total.

Rule #8 screamed through my skull: If the phone rings more than once per night, unplug it.

I already had.

I backed away, the manual still clutched in one hand, candle in the other. My eyes flicked to the wall clock.

2:51 AM.

And just like that, another rule surfaced.

Rule #9: Never look at the reflection in the window after 2:44 AM.

I hadn’t meant to. I swear I hadn’t.

But the moment I thought it, I looked.

And that’s when I saw it.

Not in the window itself, but in the reflection. In the far corner of the room, behind me—a tall, human-shaped figure. Perfectly still. Head cocked slightly to one side like it was trying to understand me.

My breath caught in my throat like a wire pulled tight.

I turned.

Nothing there.

I whipped back to the window—and it was still there. Same spot. Same tilt of the head.

Watching.

Unmoving.

I lit another red candle. Then another. My hands moved on instinct now—desperation drowning thought. The room bathed in flickering crimson light. Shadows danced madly along the walls.

The figure remained. Still. Patient.

Then—I blinked.

And it was gone.

Just gone.

No sound. No movement. Like it had never been there.

But I knew it had.

My instincts screamed: Get out. Get in the truck. Drive until the sky changes.

But the manual… it said nothing about leaving. Not once.

And suddenly that absence felt deliberate.

Like the rules had never been written for leaving.

Only for surviving until morning.

And morning felt very, very far away.

Then it hit me—Rule #11.

Don’t eat the food in the fridge after midnight.

Simple. Strange. I'd read it like a joke the first time. But now, it loomed in my mind like a warning carved into the walls of a tomb. Something churned in my gut—hunger, maybe. Or dread wearing hunger’s mask.

I moved toward the fridge.

Every part of me screamed don’t, but my hand gripped the handle anyway. It was cold. Damp with condensation.

I opened it.

And found… nothing.

Not empty shelves. Not expired leftovers.

Nothing.

Every item that had been there earlier—gone. Erased. As if they'd never existed.

Except for one thing.

A single, folded note resting where the milk used to be.

I unfolded it slowly, heart pounding like a drumbeat in a funeral march.

“Don’t look at the window again.”

That was it. No explanation. No name. Just that one line, like the fridge itself was whispering.

My hand trembled as I slammed the door shut.

Then—knock knock knock.

Again.

Same rhythm. Same weight.

The sound drilled into me, stripped away whatever calm I had left. My whole body tensed, but this time, instinct didn’t scream. This time, I didn’t freeze.

I glanced at the clock.

1:35 AM.

I blinked.

Wait.

That was past the time window. Rule #1 ended at 1:34 AM.

Technically… I could open the door.

And I did.

Cautiously. Slowly. Holding my breath like it might make a difference.

I opened the door.

And saw nothing.

Just the empty desert, black sky overhead, wind rustling sand like whispers too quiet to understand.

But then—I looked down.

And that’s when my stomach dropped.

A second manual lay on the ground.

Different cover. Thicker.

Stamped in large, blood-red lettering:

“Rules for Eric – Night Two.”

Night two.

There wasn’t supposed to be a night two.

I wasn’t coming back. No one was.

That’s when I realized the truth.

This place—Station 119B—wasn’t a weather station. It never had been. It was a test. A ritual. A trap.

And I wasn’t an employee.

I was a subject. A sacrifice. A participant in something I didn’t understand and could never escape.

Maybe I hadn’t broken Rule #1. Not technically.

But I didn’t care about technicalities anymore.

I was done playing by their rules.

I walked back inside, teeth clenched, and dropped the new manual into the candle flame.

Just like Rule #12 said: If Rule #1 is broken, burn the manual immediately… and pray.

The paper caught instantly. The flame devoured it. Pages curled and blackened, the fire dancing like it had a mind of its own.

Like it was laughing.

I backed away.

That’s when the room changed.

Instantly.

No warning. No flicker. Just gone.

The cot—gone. The fridge—gone. The desk, the equipment, the satellite phone—all erased.

The room had reset.

Same size. Same shape. Same walls.

But stripped bare.

Just me.

The window.

And the candle.

My breath came in shallow gulps.

Then came the tapping.

But this time—it wasn’t on the glass.

It was inside the walls.

Light, skittering taps at first. Then heavier. Then moving.

Circling me.

Like something was crawling through the concrete. Tracing a spiral I couldn’t see. Trapping me in the center.

My mouth opened, but no sound came out.

And then—I remember screaming.

I don’t remember why, exactly.

Only that my voice tore from my throat like it was trying to escape without me. I remember scratching at the door. Fingernails splitting against steel. I remember the candle going out.

And I remember the shadows.

They crawled under my skin.

Not metaphorically. I could feel them. Like black centipedes burrowing through my veins. Eating their way into my thoughts.

Then—

Nothing.

I woke up at dawn.

Face down in the dirt, fifty yards from the station. My clothes damp with dew. My hands shaking.

My car keys clenched tight in one fist.

The manual—gone.

I stumbled back to the building.

The door hung open. No lock. No chain.

Inside?

Empty.

No furniture. No gear. No candles.

Only one thing remained.

A mirror.

Taped to the center of the window.

I walked up to it.

I should’ve turned away.

I should’ve remembered Rule #9.

But I looked.

And what looked back wasn’t me.

It wore my face—but not my eyes.

The eyes were wide. Too wide. Stretched like the skin around them had been peeled back.

They were black, bottomless. Not hollow, but full—of things I couldn’t describe. Things that watched from the other side of glass. Things that waited.

Things that remembered.

Now?

I don’t take jobs anymore. I don’t go outside after dark. I stay indoors. I keep the lights on. I pretend the rules still protect me.

But nights are hard.

Sometimes I hear knocking.

Always three times.

And if the wind ever dies completely…

I stop breathing.

Just in case it's still out there.

Waiting for me to forget the rules.

Even just once.",5,1757048805.0,nosleep,1,0.86,False
1n8wgc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosis/comments/1n8wgc6/catholic_priest_prophesized_me_speaking_over_a/,catholic priest prophesized me speaking over a crowd- manipulation? delusion? occultic activity,"hey everyone, i wanted to get on here and be vulnerable about some life events that severely impacted me and get a better understanding and public opinion. there are parts of my story i have no way to explain rationally, and i would appreciate insight. i am 19, and after some traumatic life events (death, severe accidents, ect) i was baptized on my own will by my mom, who has worked in christian ministry for years and went to graduate school for spiritual direction. i grew up religious but in adolescence i was more spiritual, and didn't keep up with any specific practices or attend church regularly.

i was in college, and painting for some of my classes. something that spurred my baptism was my art, in which symbols emerged that were profound to what i was going through at the time. one day, i listened to a podcast where they were outlining Jon Benet Ramsey and satanic ritual abuse. at the end of the podcast, she revealed a factual tie to my hometown where i was attending college classes. the father of Jon Benet dated someone who went missing from a local community's mother. this was very jarring for me as it was so close to home. i was definitely in a traumatic almost fight or flight state, but i was reading people like Noam Chomsky and right before i was baptized wrote the phrase 'scarcity is created', as kind of a 'love is the answer' message. but the mkultra and occult information i was consuming was so jarring and i was not in the right state of mind- the most rational thing i thought to do was to publicly post about this stuff. in hindsight, i wouldn't have gone so public with it at all. one day, i went to the local paint shop to pick some stuff up and i met a very nice man lets call him Bryan, we became social media friends before i became aware of the occultic activity. Bryan has a friend named Ethan who is a major art dealer in the town, and Ethan randomly followed my art account. fast forward i was working at a coffee shop after learning about the darker stuff and Bryan comes in, we exchange niceties. then maybe an hour later, Bryan comes in. Bryan directly mentions his occultic activity to me, i have no idea why, but we were both aware of what was going on.

After this i became interested in the catholic church, trying to seek the light in opposed to the dark, i had visited a shrine and prayed the Adoration prayer- that i do not want to know of myself or the world anymore. all of this is fine, i meet a nice Catholic guy at my college. I decide to sign up for a catholic weekend retreat through my college to learn more. This is where it takes a turn- at the last night of the retreat we are in adoration - which is where you gaze into the Eucharist- the body of Christ. I am praying asking if God has a higher calling for my life- and my eyes are kind of not focused - in the darkness a face starts to appear in the Eucharist- it looks like the Shroud of Turin. Then a Holy Golden crown of thorns forms in the Eucharist. I go home, tell my friend about it. we attend adoration and i have a second, quick vision, but this one is like the white washed version of Christ very briefly. Finally, weeks later, I am in a 24 hour adoration later at night and there is only one woman in the room. At this point i have written down my own prayers, and ask if i can do them, she's happy to have me say them out loud. she tells me her dream has always been to see Christ's face in the Eucharist, so i get a feeling something might happen for her. She does the prayers for the hour, which are ritualistic repeating at the turn of the hour, and all of a sudden the room is clouded in yellow as we are praying, she whispers to me ' i can feel Him here' i tell her I see something, I'm going to stay still and wait for it to fully form. Then the room gets darker and I have trouble describing it- like a temple- like the symbolic body of Christ. At the time I related it to the bridegroom of Christ in Revelation 21. It was very mystical. After I get up, we discuss, she says she felt the Holy Spirit all over her body.

I went to confession as a non Catholic, and the priest told me unprompted after i shared a few things with him that I was going to speak in front of a large crowd one day and i would be a big figure in the Catholic Church. My friend who I mentioned before, we were starting to date and he heard a female voice in the shower saying ""do not condemn'. My mother, when she met my father, had a dream in which a female voice told her to marry my father and that they would be 'united in ministry'.

At this point, I had also learned about sophia, which happens to be my part of my name. This is where I feel there's a manipulation or ego- psychosis - at the time i believed I had a special mission, even delusions that i was divine. But at the same time there were very many real, unexplainable phenomena. I can admit that I was unwell, I wasn't attending to my schoolwork.

A key event as well was one day i was on the way to walmart and I drive pass what was likely a homeless person on the street, but it looked like a undiscernible lump of flesh- I call 911 out of fear. I get a call a few hours later asking if it was a human, and me being unwell, i cry and assume someone had died. I had my friend come over and we prayed the rosary for the repose of the soul. That just coincidentally happened to be the same exact time Pope Francis passed away, further indulging my belief that I was special in some sense.

That is the end of everything involving the Catholic Church- the story devolves into me meeting a group of people in my town who live with someone claiming to be christ reincarnated (that will have to be another post maybe in a different subreddit)

I struggle to make sense of this in hindsight. I don't understand the intentions of those encouraging me, and after doing more research into the Church, I am no longer looking to be a member and I stopped OCIA classes after 2.

I do believe i was unwell and I am grateful to be on the other side, I have been a regular attendee of therapy for the last 4 years and she cleared me for being in a manic episode, because my symptoms didn't last longer than 3 days. but i can admit there is likely some psychosis in this mix. however I still lack understanding about why this happened, it was truly moments of beautiful clarity and salvation, but also, i lost friendships and academic health during this disorienting time",2,1757048738.0,Psychosis,0,1.0,False

So for the past 3 1/2 years, I’ve been in the healthiest relationship of my life, but it didn’t start that way. when I was 19, I had just gotten out of a really toxic relationship and so did he. As friends, we looked for comfort in each other and found ourselves hanging out every day and actually having a deep connection and being really attracted to each other. I was fresh out of a relationship with a dealer so I was used to smoking weed every day and spent most of the time partying with my friends. He and I were not in the same friend group so we hung out separately, but he was in the same situation except worse because he started to become addicted to harder drugs, like cocaine and percs. I was slowly starting to smoke less less every day because I never really cared to in the first place. It was just the normal for everyone around me at the time so that’s what I was used to. everyone in the group decided they wanted to do Xanax so like a follower I did Xanax and before taking it I had actually told my ex fiancé to come and pick me up so we could sleep together and I will admit I only did it because I didn’t want to have a panic attack while we were doing things and in 100% honesty I took a shot. I blacked out completely well on the Xanax, which turned out to be fake and remembered zero of the night. I found out the next day from my friends that he had dropped me back off at their apartment. We hooked up in the shower, and then he placed me in the pullout bed in the closet. When I tried contacting him the next day, I got no response. I thought I messed up and then I might’ve done something embarrassing just to find out he who was also supposed to come over and take the Xanax with us never did and he was just high off of a perc. His mom went through his phone and assumed that he had took Xanax with me and when we had talked again, he told me he didn’t take it until later, but he had passed out from a perc His brother gave him, but his brother lied and said that I gave it to him .Pretty soon I ended up cutting my whole friend group off because they were older than me and I felt like they weren’t genuine friends and most of them were just friends with me because they were attracted to me. 90% of the big friend group was guys and me and one other girl had had a big falling out so I didn’t see a reason to keep clinging to the group and noticed myself losing weight and feeling better when I wasn’t around them because I wasn’t drinking anymore. This just led to me getting closer to my soon to be fiancé. He and I would hang out smoke and talk like stoners do and he had his own separate thing going on that had him still doing snow and percs with his brother who is significantly older than us by the way. At this point in time, I would only smoke when I hung out with him and didn’t really drink anymore either. I’m 20 years old and we start dating and we are on and off for about six months. During this six months right before asking me out, his mom told him that he had to go to his exes event because he had already made that commitment although they made that commitment while they were together so three days before asking me to be his girlfriend he went to her event which I didn’t find until later on, he slipped up in a story. So even though I found this out about a month late, I freaked out broke up with him, but I told him we were still cool and I didn’t want to talk to him, but I didn’t wanna be together. I unblocked my toxic ex from when I was 19 just to find out a few days later from him that my friend had died being hit by a drunk driver so we hang out after her funeral which happened pretty soon and I found out she died the day that me and my ex fiancé got together. My ex from when I was 19 and I get coffee one more time and we talk about life and some mutual friends and both go visit the widow of our dead friend and he leaves his wallet in my car. About a week later, my ex fiancé, and I decide we want to see each other and rekindle things and he finds my exes wallet in my car to which he freaks out and my responses. I owe him no loyalty since he gave me no loyalty in the first place by asking me out three days after seeing his ex and lying to me about it Rather than just telling me upfront, he has to go keep his commitment and then just waiting until later to ask me out instead of doing it in the same week. And I’ll admit it was 100% an ego thing because I understand we weren’t together at the time but three days before is what really hurt. we get back together, but we are getting back together on the basis of we have all these trust issues, but we’re mutually on each side. 
This makes a spiral into the worst and most toxic stage of our relationship and without too much detail, I look like a well off only fans creator, who doesn’t show her face in videos, but her body at the time before I had started working out, looked exactly like mine, and I had no distinguishable, tattoos at the time to prove it wasn’t me. And at the time I was pretty down bad on money so I will admit I it wouldn’t have been above me. With that being said he would accuse me night and day of being this girl or cheating on him which later on in our relationship, we both agreed was due to him abusing cocaine. But it had gone so bad to the point that he wound up, choking me and bruising me and would yank me by my arm until I had purple spots and would pull me by my hair, but luckily I have thick hair so none of it ever fell out. None of these things were hard enough to actually make me feel hurt and I know a real abuse feels like because I was abused as a child. With that being said, I didn’t think it’s OK and I am the type of person to think if they do this now what did they do later so we break up again. We have a few more toxic arguments on both sides for example, I had wanted to see my friend and he thought I was going to go see a guy and we had a rule in our relationship where we had no opposite gender friends. He didn’t believe me when I said I was gonna go see a female friend, so he parked his car behind mine and I was so mad I reversed into his car and dented it, which consequently led to him breaking my window. 

With all this being said a lot more had happened along those lines and one day we sat down and decided we just weren’t going to treat each other like that anymore. And after that, he’s only slipped up twice early on and lied about drug use.
I told him I wanted somebody who could support me and I wanted to be a stay at home wife so he actually went to school for something that wouldn’t let him take drugs and now he won’t even touch weed. 

After getting our lives together and him going through school we actually were having the time of his life. He was working part-time while looking for a job. Neither of us were doing drugs or even drinking and this is around the age that I’m 21 so we’re when you’re in and we’re actually having the time of our lives and this is a healthiest I’ve been in my life and in my relationship ever. You wouldn’t have even realized that we were the same people and he turned into the best person in the world. He had my back 100% he fixed insecurities. I didn’t know I had and he made me believe that people can actually change and still to this day. I do feel that way. I’d love to sit here and describe every good thing about him after saying everything bad but it’s not relevant to our break up. But please keep in mind. This man is actually an angel. My family is aware 100% of what had happened and did not like him at first and grew to love him because he so genuine change and remorse and he has helped us all out in so many ways and been there for every single person in our family.

So at 22 we wound up getting engaged and obviously we’ve had normal couples arguments but overall I would say our relationship was way healthier than the ones I’ve seen in my own life, and I did not feel that I was carrying the mental load of our relationship and never once has he made me feel unattractive or unwanted or that he would cheat on me while we are in a relationship, at 23 I decide I actually want to get a career because I’m tired of working two jobs which I do not have to do because he makes more than enough money, but I do it by my own choice because I like to treat my family who is not as well off and I love to treat myself and I have no issue for working for the things I want. The issue is I’m going to a school who quite literally only had three women on campus when I toured it, this brought up some jealousy issues again when I had mentioned that he would probably have to be fine with me being not best friends, but maybe casual friends with the guys at work so I could communicate with them over Instagram or text about class and if I was confused on anything or missing an assignment. I did not want to be isolated because there are times on my regular job where I have been isolated because I have purposely not formed any sort of bond with the males at my job because I didn’t want to make him feel uncomfortable. issue number two and in a self-aware way, I would say that I am an attractive person physically. So I have posted on TikTok and got more than a few likes when posting my outfits and tattoos, to which he accused me of doing for male attention until I pulled up the analytics of it being 75% women. Our arguments kept getting worse and worse and we mutually agreed to break up and I can’t help but wonder if it was a dumb reason to break up when 90% of our relationship was amazing and we were just going through a rough spot because he isn’t used to all the attention that he seen me get since I’ve posted myself and realizing that is how people treat me when he is not around. 

We have communicated a few times since then to which I told him I do not want to get back together because the women and his family have called me disrespectful for going into a male dominated field and posting myself online in revealing clothing, although they have seen me in the so-called revealing clothing and have actually worn way more provocative clothing, the only difference and why it looks more revealing on me is because of my body shape. So his mom went through his Apple Watch while he was working to see our messages and found me saying that I didn’t want to raise my kids in a family where they were going to be talked about in group chats and have their grandmother making shady about their mother and screenshots of what I had her posting about his sister-in-law. Without being said, I broke up with the intention of showing him. I was going to go through school, not talking to anyone and show him that I really did not have interest in the men. I just had interest in my career, prove him wrong and hope that he would then learn to trust me and see that I was serious about myself in my career. It just hurts because I supported him through school and his addiction and now I’m working two jobs and going to school all on my own. While , he didn’t have to work while going to school and I paid for our dates and tried to help him out as much as I could. Originally when I had signed up to for school too, before touring it, he had promised that he would have my back and he would take care of me while I was going to school. So it hurts knowing I will be 100% alone on this with no one to fall back on. 

So am I the asshole for breaking up with him because I didn’t like how jealous and insecure he was acting about me going to school with men. And how I felt, he is jealous of the attention that I get online? 
(we stayed friends because we really are in love but I really don’t see how I could make this work especially when his family hates me and I’m not the biggest fan of them either, I know he is capable of change because he’s done it before with bigger things, but the possessive thing is the one thing that has stayed) ",0,1757048548.0,AITAH,3,0.33,False

I was heading towards the self checkout line and he approaches me and asks for my number. He was polite, confident, friendly, funny, had the sexiest smile, and had such a deep voice! I…was…smitten! I was immediately intrigued by his aura so I gave him my number. Later that evening he called me and for the next couple of weeks we spoke every night…all night long! He opened up so much to me about his life. He did have a troubled past and the things he went through were pretty traumatic. I usually don’t open up about so much of myself so early but I felt compelled to since he was being vulnerable to me. I told him all I could think of about myself. The good, the bad, and the not so sexy…e-ver-y-thing!! He told me that he was gonna make me his wife. He also came out of nowhere and said that he wouldn’t mind waiting several months to have sex; that I’m a Queen and totally worth the wait! I try to not fall for lines like that but I’m a hopeless romantic and he sounded so sure! I’m a sucker for all things cheesy and corny! Well after 8 days of courting via phone we finally went on our first date at a StarBucks, and it was perfect! We were sipping our coffee holding hands, laughing & joking, and staring into each other’s eyes. He kept telling me how special I was and that I should be cherished and that I wasn’t just some girl. I was on cloud nine!! He didn’t even kiss me at the end of our date which made me want him so badly!🥰 I couldn’t wait to see him again. A few days later we go on another date, taking a walk on a trail. I was on a mission to kiss him. Those lips were so full and looked so soft…let the kissing commence! When I kissed him, I was so disappointed. I didn’t feel a single spark. The way he kissed me felt lustful and aggressive. The complete opposite of how he’s been treating me which was sweet and romantic. I still liked him a bunch and thought “We’re still learning each other, this can be improved!” Fast forward a few days later and we meet up at a park. It was heavenly! The weather was perfect, not a cloud or raindrop in sight! We sat on a bench people watching and listening to these musicians playing their music. It was a blast! We were outside from noon to almost midnight. Literally the entire freaking day! He asked me to come to his house and I accepted. I did mention that we weren’t having sex. I know he already told me that I was worth the wait but things can be different once we’re in an intimate setting. Maybe going to his house was giving mixed messages but I didn’t want the night to end and I was craving to cuddle with him badly. He took me to his place and we ate dinner in his bed, listened to music, and played uno. I loved every second of it. We later cuddled and things started to get hot and heavy. This time his kisses are soft and sensual. We start making out like crazy and his hands were all over me. I was turned all the way on…but not enough to have sex. He tries, I tell him no, and he calms down. We cuddled the rest of the night and I slept like a newborn. His chest was so comfy. His body was magnificent! He was so fit and his muscles were so defined! Felt like I was in bed with Superman. I take a Lyft straight to work from his house and thought about him the whole time. I barely got anything done. After work he asks if he could come over my place and I said hell yeah!! He comes, I make dinner, we watch my favorite movie Forest Gump, cuddled, and went to sleep. I was in heaven! In the middle of the night I wake up to him kissing my neck. We start making out and it feels fantastic. He gets on top and lays right in between my legs. I can feel him getting hard and I’m getting warm and tingly all over. I was about to say “fuck it” and give in but I snap out of it once I feel my shorts sliding down. I tell him no, he stops, and we go back to sleep. We wake up early the next morning and I make us both breakfast. Nothing crazy just pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausages, a bowl of fruit, and orange juice. I even pack up a small lunch for him. After breakfast we laid down for a moment and cuddled. I wanted to take a nap but he was trying really hard to have sex. I tell him no and this time I can see that he’s getting annoyed. I try to reassure him by saying that I’m very much into him and give him kisses before going back to sleep. After our nap, we  both had to get ready and head out for work. We hug and kiss goodbye and went our separate ways. When I got home from work he calls me. I was so excited to hear how his day went, I missed him so much! He told me we needed to talk. I immediately felt a knot in my stomach. I knew something was wrong. He told me that I triggered him badly. He said that I was a tease and that I was playing games. I was so confused, where tf is this coming from?? He said that he was a King and that he doesn’t wait for nothing! I can hear the anger in his voice, this guy was actually pissed with me! I apologized and told him that those weren’t my intentions, I just don’t sleep with people that I’ve just met. I’ve only known him for a couple weeks and that’s not long enough for me to let him inside my body. I believe in soul ties and I don’t want to be connected with just anyone. He didn’t wanna hear it so we decided to end it. I cried because it’s not easy for me to like a person and I really really really liked him.

Anxious/Advice needed,"I’m freshly 23, and my co-worker is about 26. I met her last November, and we’ve hung out a couple times already. She even invited me to her son’s birthday party, which was really sweet, but I was pretty shy since her whole family was there. It felt a bit overwhelming, but she let me invite my sister along.

Anyway, I just moved into a new apartment with my fiancé about a month ago. I have the basics set up—appliances, table and chairs, a lamp, couches, a long bookshelf (which I’m using as a TV stand for now), a small TV and Xbox, plus my desk and bed. I even have a little cat house and some scratchers for my cats. I brought along a few photo frames and some family decorations, like a fairy ring holder and a quirky patch-design cat.

I haven’t gotten around to buying much else, like a rug, coffee table, or extra decorations yet. At least my apartment came with blinds, which is a win! I feel a bit embarrassed inviting her over because the place is still kind of a work in progress, but the basics are there.

We’re planning a lunch soon, and it’ll be her, her boyfriend, and probably their son too. That makes me a little anxious, but since we met through the preschool where we work, I’m not totally unfamiliar with kids. The thing is, my apartment isn’t really toddler-proof, so I’m thinking about putting chemicals and anything hazardous up high. Maybe that’s a bit paranoid, but I’d rather be safe.

Do you have any advice on what to do while they’re here? I was thinking maybe we could watch a movie or play some board games. We talked about cooking a meal, but my stove currently gives off a terrible burning smell (it’s being checked by maintenance right now). So I thought maybe I could prep some sandwiches or make something in advance so everything’s ready when they arrive. 

Anyway, just really nervous any advice? I just worry what if it changes the friendship. Its been pretty slow building I don't text her a bunch outside of work, but we do chat at work a bit. ",2,1757048220.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

I (F32) met my fiancé (M25) three years ago through my family business. My family owns a live rock/metal venue in his city, and he and his brother were frequent visitors. At first, I honestly thought his brother had a thing for me—but I actually clicked with my now-fiancé, even though he’s 7 years younger than me. At the time, I never thought we’d end up together, but months later we were in a relationship.

From the start, I pushed him to accomplish things professionally. That’s how I was raised: in my family, we work hard and build independence. I even told him early on that if he ever wanted to move in with me, he’d need to find a job and contribute to expenses. To his credit, he did more than that—he excelled at his new job, we built a life together, and recently even started a coffee shop chain.

The siblings
This, however, seemed to bother his siblings. His brother (30M) still lives with their parents, has no career (he started two but dropped both), no job, and depends fully on his parents. His sister (36F) isn’t much better—she claims to be a psychologist with a “private practice,” but in reality it’s just a dirty, decaying house (lent by her mother) where even the bathroom doesn’t work. She doesn’t earn her living—her husband supports her.

Meanwhile, my family runs multiple businesses (the venue, a financial services company, a fintech, and now the café). Naturally, we can’t attend every family gathering, which has always bothered his siblings.

The woman
When my fiancé and I first started dating, his siblings hosted a party. That night he officially introduced me as his girlfriend, and one of his acquaintances—a woman he knew only briefly before me—had the most dramatic reaction. Her face twisted with shock, jaw dropped. She tried to corner him, and I overheard her mutter, “I can’t believe she’s his girlfriend.”

Later, she shoved me so hard during a ska slam dance that I fell and scraped my elbow. Months later, I found flirtatious messages from her on my fiancé’s phone. He wasn’t shutting her down, and I nearly ended the relationship. We reconciled only after he blocked her everywhere, and he made it clear to his siblings: if they ever invited her to anything, he would not attend.

The dog incident
Not long after, my coworker told me her dog was having an unexpected litter of Alaskan Malamutes. My fiancé’s father had always dreamed of owning one, so I offered him a puppy. My BIL lost his mind—furious I hadn’t “consulted” him first—and even threatened to abandon the dog in the streets. I was livid, refused to cave, and after that I kept my distance, only being polite.

The sibling “intervention”
After my fiancé moved in with me, his siblings staged a little “meeting” where they told him he was changing and that I was bad for him. He stood his ground, telling them he was finally accomplishing things personally and professionally thanks to me.

The birthday party—the final straw
About a year later, his siblings invited us to their birthday party (ironically, the same kind of party where the woman shoved me before). We took it as a chance to reconnect. My fiancé bought them thoughtful gifts, and we even prepared costumes for the party.

But the moment we walked in, I froze. There she was—the woman—center stage on the dance floor.

My fiancé suggested we hand over the gifts and leave, but I felt bad for some of his friends there and decided to stay a little longer. When we left, he explained to his brother why—and his BIL just rolled his eyes, minimizing everything.

Later, his sister sent him a long, venomous text saying she didn’t recognize him anymore, that she was disowning him, that I was a bitch for “limiting his time with them,” and that he was a pussy for not “standing up to me.”

That was the final straw. I told my fiancé I wanted nothing more to do with them, and he agreed.

Now
We’re no contact with his siblings, but we still have a wonderful relationship with his parents. Family events are incredibly awkward—his siblings are rude, mean, and act out whenever we cross paths.

So Reddit—AITA for cutting them off completely after they repeatedly disrespected me, my fiancé, and our relationship?",31,1757048166.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,6,0.97,False
1n8w906,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TheGreyCheshire/comments/1n8w906/the_saddest_clown/,The Saddest Clown,"Once upon time, there was a wonderul circus within the circus there were all these amazing things to see. Polka-dotted lions, Zebra's that walked on two legs, Elephants that sold top hats, and many other strange things. However, the strangest attraction rarely showed themselves. They were a very sad clown who went by the name Ana. They rarely smiled, and when they would perform for the crowds. Some would say they could swear that Ana would simply start crying. The clown never saw the tears that fell. Which only made their spot in the attraction even weirder. For many would come to the circus to see the strange sight of Ana crying while they would smile.  
  
The ringleader wouldn't pressure Ana to perform, for fear of actually upsetting the sad clown. He would encourage Ana to perform only when they felt up to it. Over the years Ana learned about themselves, which only made them doubt their performances all the more. It had been months since Ana's last performance. They kept telling themselves they weren't as amazing as the other attractions. They were particularly jealous of the Zebra and the Lion. Although all the other attractions were always envious of Ana and the performances they'd put on. Ranging from tight-rope walking, coming out of a comically small car, or even transforming normal balloons into wondrous creatures.  
  
Tonight Ana was convinced they'd finally give up on performing in front of people. They were sitting high above the gathered crowd. The crowd was the largest Ana had ever performed in front of. Many were cheering for the sad clown. Trying to encourage them to keep performing the words however fell on deaf ears as Ana could no longer hear the applause. So used to doubting themselves that all the cheers and applause seemed false to Ana. “They're just cheering because they feel compelled to.” and other such dark thoughts plagued Ana.  
  
After the last performance, Ana would spend time traveling across the world. Going to places they have never heard of. Seeing sights never before seen. A leopard that loved tea, an ant that could speak Shakespeare only. The wonders of the world never ceased to amaze Ana. Then as they were about just stop wandering and settle down. The clown came across a silly little strawberry cow talking to themselves. Or at least that's what the clown thought. Upon closer inspection the clown saw the cow was talking to her own personal crowd. Inspired but not sold. The clown wondered onward, searching for a place to call their own.  
  
The clown started to come across more and more people talking to their own personal crowds. There was a dog, a coffee eevee, a weird little elf, and a creature who can only be called Blankarooni. The clown was starting to realize that they would probably be happier with their own crowd. So they talk to those the clown had met. All of them tell the clown to try it. As the clown tried it, they realized the crowd they'd gathered had started to grow larger than anticipated. They've added more people. A poke'mon master, a cat, a fireball, and somehow a different elf, and weirdest of all they somehow found a tree to add to the mix.  
  
As the clown looked around they started to realize the circus people they met were just trying to make them happier. A small little photo dedicated to those the clown met now sits upon their desk. When the clown is feeling alone. They look at the photo with a soft smile. “Ana's Personal Circus” is written across the bottom of the photo.",1,1757048041.0,u_TheGreyCheshire,0,1.0,False

Only my first 10 days were on 5mg to help my body to quick start the process faster.

In general day 1-3 were ok, it gave me restless feet and anxiety for 4 hours after taking the pill and that's about it.

On the positive side really early starting from day 2 I had a large boost of calmness and no worries, this is the first time it started so quickly usually it needed for me atleast 2-3 weeks to start feeling more calm and happy.

Day 4-7 were bad for me. I had a lot of vertigo when moving my head and increased anxiety and it forced a intense panic attack. After that I felt extremely calm and happy for the next 20 days.

Day 7-20 brain fog, it was not intense but annoying it was hard to make calculations at work. The other thing was extreme boost of libido, it was really unholy Lexapro lol.

Today on day 28 I just now woke up with an intense anxiety attack and I'm very jiterry and my mouth is extremely dry even tho I drink plenty of water. I can feel the anxiety attack lowering intensity relatively quickly overall the peak lasted for 20 minutes and quickly lowered after reaching its peak.

This goes to show that it can still be a rollercoaster of calmness and anxiety day by day even tho I was perfect for the last 20 days and it's been over a mouth with ups for the most part. 

Sleep has been hard for me it feels impossible to sleep more than 6 hours. 

Aways have a buddy with you for the process because it can suck alot at times, my wonderful girl helped me a lot and my cat as we speak is puring on my shoulder during the entire process of the anxiety attack to help me calm down ❤️ while I walk around trying to stop my feet so I can make coffee.

If you start Lexapro I highly recommend asking the doctors for a pill if he did not prescribe you one that will calm your nerve during the whole process so it won't suck as much. My doctor prescribed me menthol hawthorn and valerian, it's a wonderful herbal and harmless pill that does its job extremely well, it takes about 40 minutes to kick in we get it here without prescription. 

If you suffer from panic disorder, anxiety or just afraid of the side effects ask your doctor to start at 2.5 mg or lower, usually they prescribe to people with anxiety and panic 5 mg at first and then up it to 10mg after 2 weeks. 

I had trial and error before finding the perfect dose for me, expect to go the same road to find the perfect one for you. For me it turned out to be 2.5 daily during high panic or anxiety and when things are calm 2.5mg every other day does wonders.

In general here is the difference 10 mg kinda heavy side effects panic attack 1-100 days

2.5 mg every other day no side effects, panic attack 3 out of 100 days. Not a big difference for going so low.

The anxiety attack stoped totally after typing this. 

I started using this pill 10 years ago when I developed panic disorder, anxiety and agoraphobia out of the blue, I took it for 2 years so I could function and block the attacks and it really made me feel normal again. I stoped the pill did CBT and I was in remission for 5 years sadly after alot of stressful events I got anxiety disorder again but Lexapro is here to save the day as I get back on my feet again and to drop the weight of my shoulders. 

We are extremely lucky this day and age that pills like this were invented like 50 or so years ago. It really would have sucked without them to help us during the hard times. 

I'm against using pills because the fix has to calm from us in most cases but I can't deny that they help tremendously during the long haul of recovery.",1,1757047999.0,lexapro,0,1.0,False

*By The Sportswriter Who Still Thinks “Inside-50” Is a Type of Yoga*

### Parse the Odds: A Numbers Game

Let’s start with the cold, hard math. Geelong (-6.5) is the favorite at -150 (implied probability: 60%), while Brisbane (+6.5) is the underdog at +200 (33.3%). The total is set at 169.5 points, with both Over and Under hovering around 52.5% implied probability. For context, Geelong’s average margin in their six-game winning streak is 57.7 points—enough to make a math teacher cry. But here’s the twist: those wins came mostly against teams ranked 10th or worse. Brisbane, meanwhile, has the third-ranked clearance differential and a midfield that could power a Tesla if needed.

The key stat? Geelong’s 2-0 record against Brisbane this season, including a 41-point thrashing at GMHBA Stadium. But let’s not forget: those wins were against a Lions team that’s been as consistent as a toddler on a sugar rush—seven wins in nine games at the start, then two wins in six, then seven again. They’re a rollercoaster. Geelong? They’re the boring but reliable bus.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Comebacks, and a Doomsday Scenario

Brisbane’s defense is a fortress, anchored by Hugh McCluggage (a human wall who once blocked a brick during a training drill) and Will Ashcroft (who could probably catch a falling piano if it had a 50/50 chance). Their midfield, though, is a different story. Lachie Neale’s return is a game-changer—literally. The man is a midfield wizard who once turned a lost cause into a scoring shot by juggling the ball with his knees. But can he outduel Tom Atkins, Geelong’s midfield general? Only if Atkins forgets to bring his coffee.

Geelong’s weakness? Their defense. Or, as one fan put it, “a sieve that’s been upgraded to a colander.” Their forwards—Jeremy Cameron, Shannon Neale, and Patrick Dangerfield—will exploit any defensive l

In those moments, solitude shifts from feeling empty to feeling like discovery, you uncover parts of yourself that only surface in the silence.

When life slows down, your thoughts stretch, your ideas sharpen. Some of the best breakthroughs happen not in the noise, but in the calm.

Alone time doesn’t have to be dramatic. It might be cooking just for yourself, reading without interruption, or taking a slow walk with music in your ears. At first, solitude can feel uncomfortable. But with practice, it becomes freedom.

Here’s the magic: once you enjoy your own company, you show up differently with others. You’re not avoiding loneliness, you’re choosing connection. And that choice makes relationships richer.

So next time you’re alone, don’t see it as a gap to fill. See it as a gift. Because sometimes, the best company you’ll ever have is your own.",1,1757047478.0,Word_of_The_Day_Affir,0,1.0,False

However, I noticed that when I pour the cold brew into another bottle, the upper part is clean and smooth, but once I get to the bottom, it becomes noticeably thicker and murky, almost like it's mixed with some fine coffee grounds.

Is this safe to drink? And more importantly — how do I avoid this sediment problem? Is it because I'm grinding too fine or because the filter isn’t fine enough?

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.


---

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses

1n8vxcc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n8vxcc,My HomeBirth Story,"Hey, I am a young mom (18) and wanted to share my very positive homebirthing story of my second daughter.

I was 41 weeks pregnant. I had no cervical checks or anything pruor to this day, but finally decided to do a membrane sweep because I was in prodromal labour for weeks and I had my mind set on a home birth.

The whole day I was curb walking and then at 5pm went to my midwife where she told me I was 4cm and she did the sweep. Looking back now, I believe I instantly went into labour. 

She told me her hopes where high, so I went home to grab my diaper bag and went to my grandmother's house (she has a beautiful master bedroom + en suite bathroom with a two person tub). 

I put my toddler down for bed and recognized my contractions where very regular. 
I timed them for two hours from 8-11 and their was no progression so I went to sleep. 

At 1am I woke up and knew I was in labour. 

By 3am I could no longer lay in bed as the contractions would transition to my hips. (I had hip laboir with my first born and it was the most excruciating thing I have ever felt.)

I paced and then got in the bath over and over, watched greys anatomy until I got sick of noise and started worshiping. These hours were so peaceful. It was just me and my baby.

My toddler woke up at 6am (usually she sleeps in much longer than this but she cosleeps and I could not lay down to get her back to sleep) and I held her swaying back and forth until about 6:30am when it started to hurt to hold her, but because she was still so tired she did not want down. 

I woke up my mother, to which she sat up, looked at me, laid back down, and went to sleep again. 
I woke her up again and she said, ""Is this real, I thought I was dreaming again."" (She has been having dreams about ke going into labour for weeks.) To which I replied yes, its 6:30 and I have been up since 1. 

She shot up, ran downstairs to make coffee and then ran to Tim Hortons as she couldn't find any. My grandmother woke up. My contractions where very regular, and started to hurt. My grandmother was frantically telling me to call the midwife by 7am because they were so close together, but I argued they didn't hurt. She was visibly very anxious so I called anyway. 

My mom got back at 7:15. I ate a chocolate chip muffin she brought me. The midwife arrived at 7:40. She started setting up for the homebirth. At 8am she was going to head home as I didnt seem to be too far along and decided to do a cervical check to see about how long. 

She checked me and I was 9CM dilated! 

She said the only reason baby wasn't coming out is because the sac hasn't ruptured, to which I opted to let it rupture on its own. 
I turned on my worship birthing playlist and meditated on the toilet until about 8:20. I started feeling the need to push. I got in the water and was joking about how I might have one of thoes ""mermaid babies and how I could have another 10 babies if this is how my births went. (With my first I thought I may never have another because hip labour is so painful.)

I pushed very lightly, with my body. My water popped and there was meconium, so the midwife requested I get on the bed. (I am very upset I obliged because I feel as if I would have gotten the baby out standing/squating/in the water much faster than on the bed as she kept slowly going back in). 

I now called my mom who was watching my toddler downstairs in to help hold my leg as I was so tired I could barely keep my eyes open. She came in and saw me spread wide open on the bed and stood there for a second seemingly instantly traumatized. 

She got in the bed, held my leg, and I pushed. Three sets of three. On the second push my midwife said if I didn't get the baby out in the next push she would have to call an ambulance. I told her, ""Okay, Call them because she will absolutely not be out."" I pushed again, she did not call them, I was very frustrated she lied to me as I said in the Birthing Plan under NO CIRCUMSTANCES lie to me. 

I just ended up focusing on my worship music and I swear I had a direct conversation with god. 

I hit the point in labour where you think, ""I can't do this,"" and I heard him say, ""Yes you can, you were made for this. You prepared for this. You have done it before."" And a calm went over my whole body. My next contraction was almost 2 minutes after, I caled down, slowed my breathing and smiled. She was out in that contraction. 18 minutes of pushing and babygirl cried instantly. 

Perfect APGAR score, 2.5 Inches and 7LBS 13OZ. Almost the exact same as me when I was born (22 I)

She was on my chest for seemingly only a minute and they took her away to suction her lungs.
She was beautiful and slimy and perfect. 

My mom got out of the bed. She walked to the middle of the room, stared into space covered in blood, meconium, and amniotic fluid. I laughed. I couldn't even move my legs so I was still spread eagle. She covered me with a blanket, grabbed me a water and sat with me. 

After 1-2 minutes, I got up and got in the shower as I was also covered in the fluids from neck to toe. I had a quick shower, and came out to my beautiful baby peacefully attempting to open her eyes. 

I latched her, which went perfectly. My mom brought me food and after about 1-2 hours of skin to skin she brought my toddler up to meet her baby sister. She was amazed and started pointing to all of her little body parts. I still breastfeed my toddler, so she wanted milk as it was about nap time so I discovered how to feed them both at the same time. We all took a nap together.

My babygirl is now 10 weeks and a perfect little bean.

I would definitely only chose to do homebirth.

I’ve been to **Breathless Punta Cana**, and I really liked being able to walk over to **Dreams** instead of taking a shuttle. That setup was super convenient.

For our next trip, we’re looking for an adults-only resort that also has fun things like slides, a wave pool, or a lazy river either inside the resort or in the sister resort. Lots of restaurant options are a big plus, and a good coffee shop would be the cherry on top.

Let’s be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that’s okay.
Because if you’re the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered...then maybe this isn’t just a post.

Maybe it’s a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn’t know you needed, until now.

Because I don’t believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it’s been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers.. this, this is what I’ve been missing.

So hey,

I’m 26. I’m a doctor. From India.
And no, I won’t diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I’m more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I’m a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The “quotes random Marvel lines in conversations” kind.
The “still mad about how Interstellar messed with time” kind.
The “loses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi” kind.

I fall hard for characters that don’t exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness....... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I’m the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that’s equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we’re not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I’m learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there’s this voice in my head.

It isn’t always kind.
It’s definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don’t settle.
Fix what’s broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn’t care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we’re really chasing under all this noise.

I’m not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let’s keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual “hey” like they didn’t leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with “wyd” and ends it with “lol.”
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, “I’m not okay, can we just exist side by side today?” without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can’t explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don’t have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let’s get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the “let’s do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity” type.
Nope. I’m talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don’t have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with  virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it 
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, “You got this. I’m here.”
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun 
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn’t matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let’s build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we’re their therapists
Share playlists like we’re swapping pieces of our soul
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses
Argue over which villain actually had a point
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life’s too short for dignity
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I’ve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me
I’ve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up
I’ve walked alone more times than I’d like. Still do. But I haven’t stopped hoping
I don’t want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you’re:

A little cracked but still trying your best
Empathetic but forged of inner steel
Smart but soft in the ways that matter
Funny but carrying some quiet storms
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos

Then maybe just maybe  this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let’s start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners... 
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we’re all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.

Let’s make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

1 Peter 2:25 

“For your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered"" 

Stars, I want to see the stars. So so badly. The Babylonians used this ivory prison to convert units to calculate the movement of celestial bodies. The Chinese used the stars to keep time. The Egyptian pyramids were carefully aligned to stars. Religions based on stars, masses of people looking at the stars, using stars. But they’re probably not real anyway.

I slouched back into my chair, head tilting back, I let out a sigh. Looking over at the red blaring clock. 9:50PM it read.

 “Shit” I muttered, it takes me 6 minutes to get home.

I shot up, threw my notebook in my bag, and headed towards the exit. I scanned my card on the way out and heard the automatic “Thannnnks stop-ping in, Mich eelle”. I rushed down the street, fast walking over the plastic trash, trying not to trip. Hood up. Head down. Looking at no one. 

“The end is near” someone shouted.

Little do they know the end has long gone and passed.

I scanned my key card on the building entrance,”Wel comee H-me M-ichel”, taking a breath as I stepped inside and headed up the stairs. A rust looking substance dripped down the walls, shoes banging on the steel grated stair case. I pushed open a metal door labelled 13. Passing by graffiti covered door after door, it reads “Heaven on Earth” over and over. I turned down my hall. The carpet was mushy, the lights casting yellow hue over everything.

I pushed open the door to the townhouse.

“Have fun being the only one at the library all day? Reading your esoteric star books?” Ryan teased and threw me a vial. He was lounging on the couch with God knows who, three women and one man.

“Yeah yeah, don't have too much fun” I winked.  

I dug my notebook out of my bag, throwing the bag on my bed and the notebook on my desk. I held up the vial. A mesmerizing periwinkle hue of thick liquid. It's like the flower, the rarer the color the better the quality. Oh Hy-drangea, you beautiful thing you. “Heaven on Earth” they spout. I made a cup of green tea and attached my mouth piece to the vial and huffed. Feeling it dissipate into my lungs. 

Euphoria, bliss, a hug from a loved one crept over me. I melted.

I sat in my chair, sipped my tea and stared out the window, head on my knees. There isn't anything to really look at. Just concrete buildings. The turrets are on now, shooting anyone who is left on the street past 10:00PM until 7AM. And here I am watching people get absolutely torn to shreds. Red covers the streets. Fully autonomous cities. Pollution has encased the sky because of the many autonomous factories. Creating an almost night during the day. That's when I saw it, a glimmer. I hopped up to try to look closer but I think I was imagining it, I don't know, maybe it's the high. I sighed and layed down on my bed. 

Stars

I want to see stars so badly, if they're even real. Apparently, according to books, people used to study stars, map them out, and had what was called “astrological signs”. But people don't care about that anymore, they don't care about much of anything. Only the people who shout things like “The end is near” care, and only partially. Hy-drangea took that from us, it took humanity, curiosity, everything “Heaven on Earth”. But it's so good to not care. The botanists developed it that way, if the botanists are even real. I've never met a single person who was like “I’m a botanist”  and it's not like a thing to hide, if anything you would be worshiped. Apparently they used to patrol us, watch us. But not anymore, if a crime is committed then it is what it is just take the cure all, Hy-drangea. 

The sea

 

They used the stars to map out travel too. I want to see the sea too. If that's even real also.

I eventually fell asleep and was woken by screaming. 8AM the clock read. I huffed and rolled my eyes getting out of the bed. I crept out of the room, Ryan and the strangers still passed out on the couch, clothes half on. I softly opened the front door and stuck my head out looking down the hall towards the screaming.

A man was dragging a woman by her hair down the hall, a trail of fresh blood seeping into the already damp carpet, she was squirming, almost wiggling like a worm you just plucked from the soil. I squinted and noticed her head was split open. Her skin peeled back around and I noticed “Bitch” was written onto her bare skull. The man noticed me and shouted “Mind yours”. I softly shut the door, grabbed a vial off the table, retreated back to my room and proceeded to get ready to go to the library. 

Ryan was awake by the time I was about to head out. 

“Are we still meeting with April at the cafe later?” He asked. 

I nodded and headed out. 

“Se  e you lat er Mechhhhhhhhelle” the voice said as I slid my key card to go out. I made my way towards the library head down, avoiding falling on the trash and what were people yesterday that are now flesh masses littering the street. 

“Wel come t- the libra  ry Miche  lle” said the voice.

I put my bag down, a little too hard as it echoed through the emptiness of the desks that are falling apart. Went over to the “Religion” section, scanning the books. I pulled one called “The Bible” , I sat down, pulled my note book out and started studying. Apparently people used to go by this book, and had a whole buildings dedicated to it. I think that building next to one of the food distribution centers on 13th street used to be one. The stained glass windows, once probably beautiful, are busted out. Trees growing inside.

 God created the stars, and has a name for all. God made the sun, moon, and stars to provide light to the Earth.

God has long since abandoned us…. or is it the reserve? Who cares anyway. 

I swiped my key card 

“Se e you  ne  xxxxxxt tim elle”

I entered the cafe, weeds and vines growing all through. A giant poster reading “Heaven on Earth” I went to the vendor and swiped my card “On  e cofe for Mich ell e” Said the voice. A conveyor with a cup of coffee slowly made its way towards me, the belts screeching. I picked it up and sat down. Staring down at my coffee looking at the bubbles of the oily residue sitting on top. 

“Uh hey Michelle are you there?” asked Ryan, swiping his hand in front of my face. I snapped out of it. April was already sitting with a cup of coffee. Ryan sat down with his.

“I want to leave,” I said, taking a sip.

“Huh?” Asked April. Both of them looked at me confused. 

“I want to see the stars”

“Holy moly this again” Ryan said rolling his eyes “Have you heard what goes on outside the walls?”

I have, they say that it's worse than inside, there's not a decent supply of Hy-Drangea out there. People are fiending for it so badly that they've turned feral. Packs like wolves, ripping each other apart and feasting on the remains. But who knows, no one really leaves cause why would they, they don’t care enough. 

“Those are just rumors and you're not going to change my mind, besides I’m leaving no matter what, just wanted to let you both know”

“We’re coming with you” April stated.

“Oh my God” exclaimed Ryan and threw his hands up “I guess I’ll go get us some vials to last a few weeks and to barter with”

I first experienced it on November 27th at 9:14 P.M., I remember the first time I described as obtaining the superpower to honestly say I could sit here for 200 years without feeling bored, it was like I unlocked an achievement. 
I’m a minor. I haven’t been to school in two and a half years but I’m looking to enroll as soon as possible when the staff recovers from her sickness. I have one online friend, one in real life and possibly her other friend. Mine was caused by a very self-depreciating mindset that went on for years combined with starving myself and eating terribly when I did, zero exercise, I never left the house much as well, I lived through fictional characters to fancy myself like other kids while not being able to work up the confidence to tend to hobbies or educating myself. I mostly played video games, watched and re-watched shows 17 plays sometimes, a lot of anime, read manga online, never touched social apps at all. No TikTok or YouTube, in that realm! (I really like reading the comments on the manga or anime sites, though :3) I do not hate myself anymore, yet I don’t see why I would place special attention on liking myself either, I have an ego, though. I’ve started to lose fear and adrenaline as of late, I feel in a plane of non-existence. I want to heal myself and I figured I’m probably not trying my best, and by listing my usual…. routine, I wonder what others would edit about it. I wake up around 9:00, having fallen asleep around 2:30. Somedays I’ll make my bed first but I usually jet for a cup of coffee, iced with milk and honey, I don’t particularly enjoy it, it’s more annoying. Connect an earbud, the right one, for music. I’m usually aware I’ll probably procrastinate and not accomplish anything after chugging my coffee consciously or not, so I try to think positive thoughts and make me like myself. I’ll do a puzzle, play short stints of different video games, check my friend or favorite comment every 20 minutes, fret about the 30 minutes of exercise that ends up being pushed to 12:00 most days, (I don’t want to possibly have future me in a bad mood if I find it painful or taxing, I mainly worry about how future me will feel instead of not wanting to do it) place a bunch of books around me in the case of the slight chance I have a moment of wanting to read on it will be right in front of me and the want won’t go away by being ticked off of trying to find if, thinking about the next drink or meal or snack and trying not to simultaneously since I have pleasure of not thinking during that time, trying not to so I won’t feel potentially guilty at the end of the day and start criticizing myself. I am on my phone all day trying to get myself to stop thinking about people, myself, amongst other things switching between tabs on the 50th attempt to settle on something to forget I am feeling guilty for being on my phone in the first place. When nearing bedtime around 1:40, 2:00, I shower seeing if I can skip or only wash my body, and jump onto my bed with the same enthusiasm as a flying squirrel-> since I probably allowed myself to skip the things I didn’t want to do-> because I derive more joy from skipping them since they bring more frustration to learn them and more guilt and self-criticism from letting myself neglect both and forget the very basics I had my mother spend money on to purchase for me, it’s easier to put it out of my mind as a whole.
For my diet, I try to drink enough water and take vitamins daily, I frequently consume a magnesium supplement for anxiety once or twice from 3:00-6:00. I eat vegetables daily, but if there is something in the fridge that will go bad regardless if it’s also vegetables or highly processed junk I’ll feel bad for letting it go to waste and put it on my plate or ditch the veggies entirely, or eat two meals, I often forget what I’ve eaten. I have snacks a lot, random selection. I drink one or two cups of coffee a day, I think I’ll enjoy it more than water in turn I feel obliged to let myself drink it, I don’t like sodas or sugary drinks often yet if there is too much sweet tea to be rid of I’ll slurp down half a gallon in 10 minutes. I eat sweets everyday. We always have a random sweet present on the kitchen counter. Or five, depends on the week went. I do not take any medication, I try to listen to dopamine or neurotransmitter audio while sleeping, yet I’ll feel guilty for having headphones in and potentially letting my phone die and skip my alarms, I’ll let it charge and try to listen to the audio through basic sound by laying close to my phone.

He went from someone who’s passed every extreme physical with flying colors, to someone who can’t walk 30 feet without falling or stumbling. 

He went from someone who was always the chauffeur, to someone who hasn’t been behind the wheel of a vehicle in multiple years. 

He went from someone who taught me how to completely detail the semis(& if you know him, you know how particular he was about his trucks & chrome), to someone who doesn’t even know how to wash a plate.

1n8vro8,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1n8vro8/newbie_recipe_for_fruit_forward_vibrancy/,Newbie recipe for fruit forward vibrancy.,"I'm a relative newbie to pourover and have been burning through bags trying to recreate the fruit forward, vibrant, almost fruit tea like cups I get from my local coffee shop and I just wanted to post this advice for all my fellow newbies who might be scrolling through reddit and Google trying to crack the same code on achieving similar cups:

Stay off the Internet. 

I have come to the conclusion that the vast majority of people do not like what we are chasing, and their advice is geared towards a more ""coffee-like"" type cup (if that makes sense). This is absolutely fine. Not saying most people are wrong, just that what I, for one, have been chasing is not that, and it's incredibly difficult to gauge with words if the advice offered online is going to achieve the kind of taste we (if you are are like me) are looking for. 

I've wasted so much beans grinding too fine, with water that is too hot, and a bed that is too agitated, to achieve the kind of cup I've been chasing. 

I appreciate the irony of now offering advice on the Internet but I'ma do it anyway:

This has worked for me on V60, and is close as I have gotten:

1. Grind in the middle of medium course. For me that's 110 clicks on the Kingrinder K6

2. Water around 92c 

3. Don't agitate. 3 pours max with no swirls or stirring.

In recipe form:

13g coffee to 250g water (grind and water as above)

Bloom 80g - very slow, very gentle, circles out from middle. 

00.45 - second pour to 120g (40g)- same pattern as above. Do not let this pour draw all the way down.

01.15 - slow gentle pour to 250g - let draw down until one second between drips then remove dripper. 

Note: be prepared for a faster drawdown than most people recommend as ideal. 

If nothing else I think this is a good starting point (myself included. So open to further tips).

people involved: 6 ppl in total, mainly work crew. 2 ppl are not part of the crew. and also a man in a van

extra info: 2 of the ppl i work with seem resistant to God from what ive seen and heard by just being around them often. i always have in mind the verse where Jesus says smth like don’t give what is holy to dogs and don’t give your pearls to pigs. 1 person i work with is trans (male at birth. i will call him Z), which isn’t that important to the story, but important somewhat for context.

what happened: i prayed before i went to eat with all 6 of the ppl, that they would get saved. i can’t exactly remember everything i prayed about though, but i do want everyone to get saved, and their hearts & ears be opened to hear the Gospel. i ended up getting to olive garden early and i texted Z. he ended up meeting me and getting coffee at starbucks, but i didn’t want any cause i was gonna get some at olive garden. we ended up sitting outside starbucks bc Z said it was cold inside but i felt fine. i wanted to sit outside bc i felt awkward inside since there was no one in there but us, and we were waiting on the others. so we sat outside and there was a van with a man in it. me and Z kept talking and the man saw us but never did anything. before he left, he got out of his van and said “excuse me guys, i didn’t want to interrupt (he saw us talking), but God loves yall”. that rly blessed me, but Z kinda laughed it off and said “trans ppl always get told that bc of how they look”. he says ppl often say that to him, and he thought the guy said that based off Z’s appearance. by that time, the others were there, and Z told them what just happened. i was abt to cry bc i prayed a day or two before this that i wanted to know how God felt about me, even though i know He loves me. it was nice hearing it. i was also very excited that God spoke through that man. i said to Z after he said his thing that i like ppl that say stuff like that. i didn’t really say more than that bc of fear tbh. that guy made my spirit happy, but the others seemed resistant. i could share the Gospel with these folks, but based off this and other instances, i think it’s best if i let God shine His light through me. 

i thanked God for that moment, and IN that moment. i felt the Spirit rising up in me when the man left, but i sadly quenched Him and im not proud of it:( i confessed and asked forgiveness. and i also try to read ppl and situations, but i don’t rly say anything. i do watch myself though and try to shine and act like Jesus in my daily life.

what do you all think of this? could i have done something differently?

There are some things that I use on a daily basis and running out of them/it is disruptive. Like coffee or breathe right strips.

So I keep extra, but that takes shelf space and unless I remember to reorder before that runs out eventually I hit the same problem.

And Amazon subscription frequencies don’t match my consumption rates.

So for a few things I keep a worse version of it on hand that will serve the need but be annoying enough to use that I immediately order or buy the real replacement.

Like, I have mediocre instant coffee, and a box of the wrong size of breathe right strips.

That way I never truly run out, but have a strong enough motivation to reorder.

I know, it’s silly. I should just be more organized. But this works for me.",413,1757046372.0,lifehacks,50,0.89,False

I managed to get another date a couple days ago where I took her to the same coffee shop I took the previous date. She was suprisingly prettier than what I imagined based on her pictures she had on her profile. We sat there talking for about 2 hours and actually had a lot in common. I enjoyed talking to her and things felt natural. She talked about her family life and her last semester in college. She didn't seem to be turned off based on my height. we've been talking a lot daily and I'm seeing her next week after explaning I've never seen Love Island, a reality show a lot of women watch.

1n8vp2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1n8vp2t/catholic_priest_prophesized_me_speaking_over_a/,catholic priest prophesized me speaking over a crowd- manipulation? delusion? occultic activity,"hey everyone, i wanted to get on here and be vulnerable about some life events that severely impacted me and get a better understanding and public opinion. there are parts of my story i have no way to explain rationally, and i would appreciate insight. i am 19, and after some traumatic life events (death, severe accidents, ect) i was baptized on my own will by my mom, who has worked in christian ministry for years and went to graduate school for spiritual direction. i grew up religious but in adolescence i was more spiritual, and didn't keep up with any specific practices or attend church regularly. 

i was in college, and painting for some of my classes. something that spurred my baptism was my art, in which symbols emerged that were profound to what i was going through at the time. one day, i listened to a podcast where they were outlining Jon Benet Ramsey and satanic ritual abuse. at the end of the podcast, she revealed a factual tie to my hometown where i was attending college classes. the father of Jon Benet dated someone who went missing from a local community's mother. this was very jarring for me as it was so close to home. i was definitely in a traumatic almost fight or flight state, but i was reading people like Noam Chomsky and right before i was baptized wrote the phrase 'scarcity is created', as kind of a 'love is the answer' message. but the mkultra and occult information i was consuming was so jarring and i was not in the right state of mind- the most rational thing i thought to do was to publicly post about this stuff. in hindsight, i wouldn't have gone so public with it at all. one day, i went to the local paint shop to pick some stuff up and i met a very nice man lets call him Bryan, we became social media friends before i became aware of the occultic activity. Bryan has a friend named Ethan who is a major art dealer in the town, and Ethan randomly followed my art account. fast forward i was working at a coffee shop after learning about the darker stuff and Bryan comes in, we exchange niceties. then maybe an hour later, Bryan comes in. Bryan directly mentions his occultic activity to me, i have no idea why, but we were both aware of what was going on. 

After this i became interested in the catholic church, trying to seek the light in opposed to the dark, i had visited a shrine and prayed the Adoration prayer- that i do not want to know of myself or the world anymore. all of this is fine, i meet a nice Catholic guy at my college. I decide to sign up for a catholic weekend retreat through my college to learn more. This is where it takes a turn- at the last night of the retreat we are in adoration - which is where you gaze into the Eucharist- the body of Christ. I am praying asking if God has a higher calling for my life- and my eyes are kind of not focused - in the darkness a face starts to appear in the Eucharist- it looks like the Shroud of Turin. Then a Holy Golden crown of thorns forms in the Eucharist. I go home, tell my friend about it. we attend adoration and i have a second, quick vision, but this one is like the white washed version of Christ very briefly. Finally, weeks later, I am in a 24 hour adoration later at night and there is only one woman in the room. At this point i have written down my own prayers,  and ask if i can do them, she's happy to have me say them out loud. she tells me her dream has always been to see Christ's face in the Eucharist, so i get a feeling something might happen for her. She does the prayers for the hour, which are ritualistic repeating at the turn of the hour, and all of a sudden the room is clouded in yellow as we are praying, she whispers to me ' i can feel Him here' i tell her I see something, I'm going to stay still and wait for it to fully form. Then the room gets darker and I have trouble describing it- like a temple- like the symbolic body of Christ. At the time I related it to the bridegroom of Christ in Revelation 21. It was very mystical. After I get up, we discuss, she says she felt the Holy Spirit all over her body. 

I went to confession as a non Catholic, and the priest told me unprompted after i shared a few things with him that I was going to speak in front of a large crowd one day and i would be a big figure in the Catholic Church. My friend who I mentioned before, we were starting to date and he heard a female voice in the shower saying ""do not condemn'. My mother, when she met my father, had a dream in which a female voice told her to marry my father and that they would be 'united in ministry'. 

At this point, I had also learned about sophia, which happens to be my part of my name. This is where I feel there's a manipulation or ego- psychosis  - at the time i believed I had a special mission, even delusions that i was divine. But at the same time there were very many real, unexplainable phenomena. I can admit that I was unwell, I wasn't attending to my schoolwork. 

A key event as well was one day i was on the way to walmart and I drive pass what was likely a homeless person on the street, but it looked like a undiscernible lump of flesh- I call 911 out of fear. I get a call a few hours later asking if it was a human, and me being unwell, i cry and assume someone had died. I had my friend come over and we prayed the rosary for the repose of the soul. That just coincidentally happened to be the same exact time Pope Francis passed away, further indulging my belief that I was special in some sense. 

That is the end of everything involving the Catholic Church- the story devolves into me meeting a group of people in my town who live with someone claiming to be christ reincarnated (that will have to be another post maybe in a different subreddit) 

I struggle to make sense of this in hindsight. I don't understand the intentions of those encouraging me, and after doing more research into the Church, I am no longer looking to be a member and I stopped OCIA classes after 2. 

I do believe i was unwell and I am grateful to be on the other side, I have been a regular attendee of therapy for the last 4 years and she cleared me for being in a manic episode, because my symptoms didn't last longer than 3 days. but i can admit there is likely some psychosis in this mix. however I still lack understanding about why this happened, it was truly moments of beautiful clarity and salvation, but also, i lost friendships and academic health during this disorienting time.

1n8vn07,https://v.redd.it/9jxuj8yqv9nf1,Made a wooden tribute to Dieter Rams' KF20 Aeromaster coffee maker,"Took about 3 weeks to get the proportions right. The original was 1970s injection-molded plastic but wanted to see how it translated to wood.

Process was pretty involved - laser cut the top cylinder sections then laminated them together. Way more precise than trying to turn the whole thing on a lathe. Did all the perforations by hand with a drill and template which was tedious but got the look right. Base was scroll saw work to get those curves.

The cylinder approach worked much better than my first attempt at turning it solid. Could control each ring individually to match Rams proportional relationships.

Still functions as a pour-over system with a Kalita dripper. Pairs with a JetBoil camping stove which i thoght it was cool - this modernist design needing survival gear to work. Carved ""The last brew. Beauty is not a luxury"" into the base.

  
Built this exploring how traditional woodworking translates industrial design meant for mass production. The translation from injection molding to joinery really changes how you see the original.",7,1757045994.0,somethingimade,1,1.0,False
1n8vmn9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n8vmn9,New details about Suga’s experiments and how he met Nylev in the new CD,"
Some news information about Suga in the CD “If Coffee Is a Poison. It is a slow poison”, a product of Kamen Rider Gavv Final Stage, with the script written by Shintaro Asanuma(Suga) himself:

- Suga and Nyelv first met at a bookstore, where Suga was using the alias Daigo Koichi and carrying a suitcase containing a still-living person.

- The total number of test subjects Suga experimented on was 12(including Hanto). The very first subject was his own wife, who participated voluntarily. Suga kept detailed records of all his experiments. 

- In the past, Suga once implanted Granute cells into his own body without the use of anesthesia or painkillers. The modification and implantation of Granute into Suga’s body by Nyelv had already been approved by Suga beforehand.

As for the title “If coffee is a poison. It is a slow poison.” of the CD, it seems to come from a historical anecdote about Swedish King Gustav in 18th century:

In the late 18th century, Swedish King Gustav III believed coffee was harmful and ordered an experiment in which a pair of identical twin prisoners had their death sentences commuted, with one made to drink three pots of tea daily and the other three pots of coffee. Both supervising physicians died before any conclusion could be reached, and the king himself was assassinated in 1792. The tea drinker lived to 83, while the coffee drinker outlived him, though the exact age of his death is unknown. Like the king, Suga also died before seeing all of their experiments finished.",28,1757045959.0,KamenRider,3,0.98,False
