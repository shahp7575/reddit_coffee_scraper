As a first time Army wife, those posts really messed with my head, especially when my husband left for boot camp. I was in a dark place for a while.

Now that he is almost done, I wanted to share something different: it is possible to make this life work. It is not easy, and it is not perfect, but with strategies and a positive mindset, it can be done.

Here is what helped us:

We made a plan early. I decided either I would go back to school or find a work from home job. I applied like crazy to both and I actually got accepted to both. It is possible.

Why I chose WFH: I wanted my independence. Seeing posts about waiting on a spouse’s paycheck gave me a lot of anxiety. The thought of depending on one income, especially in this economy, scared me. I did not want to feel stuck or powerless financially. I also considered school, but I did not want to take on more debt. I found an online program where you can earn an MBA for around 14k, and I chose that path because an MBA is broad and flexible. In the end, I picked WFH for now to avoid childcare costs, keep money coming in, and still have options for the future.

We got creative with support. We had a relative move in with us to help with childcare and rent, which saved us a lot. If family is not an option, do not be afraid to ask a trusted friend.

We started saving and investing small. Literal pennies at first. Making coffee at home, cutting small expenses, and being intentional really does add up over time.

I built my own village. This was the hardest part. I did not have a built in support system, so I made one. A neighbor who is going through a divorce and a group of teenage girls who babysit. I went through a local Boys and Girls Club so staff could help vet teens they thought would be a good fit, and I am really glad I did.

The village did not look how I imagined it would, but it showed up.

This post is not meant to make anyone feel bad. Everyone’s situation is different, and some seasons are incredibly hard. I just wanted to offer hope and practical advice to new military wives who might be scared or overwhelmed right now.

With strategies, flexibility, and a willingness to ask for help, this life can work. You are not alone. 💛",1,1766505759.0,MilitarySpouse,0,1.0,False
1ptxj89,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ptxj89,Manganese glass found in a coffee farm in rural Colombia 🇨🇴,"Hi everyone,
I recently started collecting UV-reactive glass in Europe, and during a visit to my family’s old coffee farm in the mountains of Colombia — where I grew up — I found these glasses that belonged to my great-grandmother.

They look completely clear in normal light, but under 365 nm UV they fluoresce yellow / green. From what I’ve learned so far, they seem to be manganese glass.

What fascinates me most is *how and when* glass like this could have made its way to rural Colombia. Was this type of glass commonly imported during the coffee boom? Europe to Latin America?

I’d love to hear any insights about its possible origin or time period.

1ptxhjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpanishAIlines/comments/1ptxhjd/the_tiny_secret_to_fluent_spanish_diminutives/,The 'Tiny' Secret to Fluent Spanish: Diminutives Explained,"Spanish diminutives are everywhere and they’re not just about size. Yes, -ito/-ita can mean “small”, but in real life they’re often used to show affection, politeness, softness, or even irony. If you learn a few of the most common diminutives and what they really imply, you’ll understand native Spanish much better and sound a lot more natural.

1 . The most common diminutive endings:

\-ito / -ita: (It’s generally used when the word ends in a vowel, which is dropped.)

* momento → momentito
* perro → perrito
* gordo → gordito

\-cito / -cita: (It’s generally used when the word ends in *e*, *n*, or *r*.)

* café → cafecito 
* flor → florcita 
* pobe → pobrecito

2 . What diminutives really *do* in Spanish (4 key functions):

2.1  The “Softener” (politeness strategy) 🙏

Spanish speakers often use diminutives to make requests sound less direct and more friendly.

* Espere un momento. → Wait a moment.
* ✅ Espere un momentito. → Wait just a sec (softer, nicer)
* Ponme un café. → Get me a coffee.
* ✅ Ponme un cafecito. → Get me a coffee (friendlier / more casual)

Idea: if it sounds “smaller”, it feels like less of a burden.

2.2  The “Sugarcoat” (making negatives sound gentler) 🍬

Diminutives can soften harsh adjectives and make them sound more playful or affectionate.

* gordo → fat → gordito → chubby
* tonto → stupid → tontito → silly / a bit slow 

2.3  The “Affection / warmth” (for people & pets) ❤️

Diminutives are super common when talking to (or about) loved ones. They add warmth, tenderness, and closeness.

* mi abuelita → my dear grandma
* hijito / hijita → my dear son / daughter 

Idea: it’s not about size — it’s about affection.

2.4 The “Just a little” (minimizing) 🤏

Use diminutives to downplay something and make it sound small / not serious.

Estoy un poquito cansado/a. → I’m a little tired.  
Es un problemita. → It’s a small problem. (can be sincere… or not)

3 .  Super useful diminutives you’ll hear every day

* un poquito → a little bit
* un momentito / un segundito → a sec
* un ratito → a little while
* cerquita → really close
* despacito → slowly (soft / friendly)
* ahorita → right now / in a bit (depends on country!)
* calentito → nice and warm
* fresquito → nice and cool / a bit chilly
* bajito → quietly / in a low voice / short (person)

1ptxh87,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ptxh87/aitah_for_leaving_after_my_boyfriend_kept_hinting/,AITAH for leaving after my boyfriend kept hinting he’d hurt himself every time I tried to break up?,"I (27F) have been with my boyfriend (29M) for a bit over a year. At first he was sweet in that intense way that feels flattering, like constant texts, “good morning gorgeous” every day, wanting to know what I’m doing. I’m not new to relationships, but I’ll admit I liked the attention. Over time it turned into him needing updates for everything and getting weird if I didn’t answer fast enough. If I went out with friends he’d say he was “fine” and then later tell me he sat alone in the dark because he felt like a burden. Stuff like that.

The first time I tried to end it was after a fight where he grabbed my wrist hard enough to leave a faint mark. He apologized a lot, said he was scared and I “triggered” him by walking away mid argument. When I told him I can’t do this anymore, he went really quiet, stared at the floor and said, “If you leave, I dont know what I’ll do. I’m not strong like you.” Then he asked if I’d be okay with him “just not waking up one day.” I freaked out, called his best friend, stayed the night because I felt guilty and terrified. Next morning he acted normal, made coffee, joked about my messy hair. Like it never happend.

After that, every time I brought up us not working, he’d slip in some version of it. Not always direct. Sometimes it was “I’ve been having dark thoughts again” or “I looked at the bridge on my walk and it was kinda tempting lol” (yes he added lol). If I tried to set boundaries he’d say I’m cold. If I cried he’d tell me I’m making it about me. He’d also do this thing where he’d text “sorry” and then vanish for hours so I’d panic and call him. When I’d finally reach him, he’d be like “see, you do care.” It made me feel trapped.

Two weeks ago I finally told him I’m done and I can’t be his therapist. He started shaking and said “okay, I’ll just go then.” He grabbed his keys and walked out. I followed him to the parking lot like an idiot, begging him to talk, because my brain went straight to worst case. He didn’t get in the car. He just stood there and said “I knew you’d come after me.” Something in me snapped. I went back upstairs, packed his hoodie and spare stuff into a bag, and left it outside my door. I blocked him.

Now his friends are messaging me saying he’s “not doing good” and that I abandoned someone with depression. One of them said if anything happens it’s on me. I have this sick feeling in my stomach, but also I’m so tired. Am I actually the asshole for leaving?

I've a boyfriend for like 5 years now and he is the sweetest ever. I spend so much time with him. However, I feel very lonely because I don't have many friends. I've never had many friends and was always okay with it. But for the last few months I've been feeling very lonely. 

In a Dutch Reddit group, I posted a message in which I asked if anyone was open for a friendship. A few people reacted, but I get along the best with a 36 y/o male. But surprise: he is gay as well. I'm not looking for something else etc., but only for a genuinely good friendship. I've already chatted to him a couple of days and he seems very relaxed and chill. I don't get weird vibes of him and he asked me if I want to meet next week. Not at his home, but just in the city center. Just to drink a coffee or something.

My boyfriend is just not waiting for me to make gay male friends. And I truly understand it, because I made a mistake by sending some pics to a guy in the past. But this time I'm over it and just wanna be friends. This guy also said he doesn't have any weird intentions and I truly believe him. 

Is this a good idea? Should I tell my bf? Because I just KNOW he won't let me meet that guy.... but I feel like it could be a good friendship. Maybe my boyfriend shouldn't be that controlling about me...

1ptxdu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ptxdu7/sil_hosted_thanksgiving/,SIL Hosted Thanksgiving,"Ranting from anon acct. 

At this point, I don’t care if my SIL sees this and pieces together it’s me. 

Me - 46m, wife 38f, son 10m, daughter 8f
Wife’s family:
SIL - 42f, BIL 44m, niece 11f, nephew 7m
FIL - 71m, MIL 70f

She is a not generally a nice person. She’s rude, a whiner, and complainer. Worst, she knows and does. Not. Care. She almost brags about it, with a shrug and tilted head as to say “oh well, that’s me. Deal with it”. I don’t know how her husband does it. I’ve wanted to literally punch her in the mouth multiple times over the 15ish years I’ve known her. 

The number of excuses my inlaws and my wife make for her is insane. “Well that’s Auntie for you” - describing her as an aunt in the family with the same attitude, as though it’s justification for her. 

They live 6 hours away from us and my inlaws so we agreed a several years ago to up there for Holidays every 3-4 years so they weren’t always coming here. It gives my MIL a break (where SIL and her family stays) but it puts a lot of “pressure” on SIL to “prepare the meal”. 

This year, I helped fry the turkey because she wanted to cook it outside because her “little kitchen” is too small and it would take too much space. She has a single oven but her kitchen is nearly 500 sq ft. It’s literally larger than my studio apt I had in college. That’s fine. I agree to help because my FIL has done this once and BIL has never fried a turkey. No biggie. 

I ask SIL, what time do you he want to serve lunch? She says 12:30. Okay, perfect. I back up the time to start the cooking for us and we get started. Bird is done at 12:15. That gives time to rest and slice right around 12:30. 

When we bring the bird in, I’m instantly pissed. She hasn’t even started cooking all the sides. We don’t eat until 1:15. 

We start making plates and the meal is fine I guess. Now this is a little bit my problem, but I grew up with my grandparents or my great uncle hosting Thanksgiving with our entire side of the family, 50+ people most years. It’s a giant spread. Host takes care of the meat/drinks and then the group is split into sides and desserts. Always plenty of food. 

I start making my plate and there’s no stuffing because SIL doesn’t eat it so she didn’t see the point in making it. We have a hash brown casserole, which okay, it’s a Midwest thing, but seriously, no mashed potatoes? Okay, fine I’ll suck it up. There’s also no gravy because she didn’t want to make a mess, whatever that means. So we had turkey - which as many of you have figured out was cold by this point, hash casserole (frozen hash, canned cream of mushroom soup, and cheese), green beans, salad, cranberries, and store bought rolls. 

There’s no other meat, no mashed potatoes, no gravy, no stuffing, no Mac and cheese, no corn, no warm rolls, nothing I would traditionally expect at Thanksgiving. She said she doesn’t want leftovers at her house so she refused to cook more than she thought we would go through for that meal. 

Thank goodness they bought a 14 pound bird, because we ate nearly everything and had sandwiches and chips for dinner that night using the leftover turkey. The kids got all the remaining sides because there wasn’t enough for everyone. 

For dessert, they had the in-laws pickup pies from a bakery in Memphis, but because they didn’t pre-order (she asked them on the Monday before Thanksgiving), everything was a 6” pie and they got 3 different pies so we would have a little variety. I’d never been to this bakery and the pies were terrible. Not nearly sweet enough and the crust was bland, thick, and chalky. 

I’m by no means a chef, but given the opportunity, I would’ve had 4-5 different semi-homemade pies made beforehand to bring to this shin-dig. I can cook a variety of things and have made several desserts everyone liked at other get togethers. 

They’re in Northeast Missouri and we live north of Memphis., It’s cold outside and my SIL being peri-menopausal refuses to turn the heat on above 65. We’re freezing the whole time. I rarely wear multiple layers because I run hot and I’m in a sweater just to keep the edge off. My wife runs cold and she’s clinging to life in her Carhartt. 

They only have a sectional couch big enough for their family of 4 and there’s 10 people in total. My wife and I are literally sitting on the floor. After a couple hours, SIL asks if I want to sit on a pillow - and at this point, I’m raging so I refuse out of spite. You want me uncomfortable - I’m going to stay freaking uncomfortable. She has not offered her “spot” to my wife who’s visibly uncomfortable. Just a pillow to continue sitting in the floor. 

They have a dining room, but she freaked out the last time we came and tried to bring the dining chairs into the living room so we just abandoned that idea completely. 

We stayed three nights at their house and I was ready to leave the first morning because she clearly doesn’t care to be a suitable host. She got angry with my in-laws because they chose to eat breakfast at the hotel they were in because there’s not enough room for all of us to stay and my in-laws wanted the kids to spend time together (house has big living spaces, but only 4 bedrooms and an office - master, niece & nephew’s room, and 1 guest room). She “made breakfast” so she couldn’t believe FIL & MIL weren’t there for breakfast. It was a breakfast casserole. That’s it. Eggs, sausage, and cheese cooked in the oven for 40 minutes. She literally lays into FIL for not being there immediately for breakfast. The poor guy made a plate just to appease her. 

She demanded we go out for dinner that Friday because “she wasn’t cooking again” and then shot down over 8 places my in-laws offered as suggestions. Finally, we agree on her idea of Mexican food. At the restaurant, my wife got stuck at the end of the table with the kids and my SIL made sure she didn’t have to manage them at all. Just treated my wife as a sitter. I offered to swap with her and put myself down there, but my wife insisted I sit next to FIL so we could chat. So it ends up adults on one end and the kids and my wife on the other. They’re not super young, but get rowdy when they’re together - between 7-11 years old. 

Kids get rowdy as expected, my wife has to calm them down multiple times. Kids get loud and SIL yells at my wife - her own sister - to get them under control. My wife is fuming. After dinner, my wife went to her parents (FINALLY) and said this is where she draws the line. No more being ignored and treated as second class. 

We get back and I’ve got everything packed up to load up and be gone by 9am the next morning.  I told her we needed to just leave that night, but she didn’t want to cause a fight so we stayed. My wife is very compassionate and I love her for it, but man it’s tough when I see how she’s treated by her sister. 

Mornings are fun there because I have to walk on egg shells. I get up early to work out before everyone is up at home, 4:30am. So I “sleep in” until 5:30 and go make coffee. The first time I ever stayed there, I dropped something as I was grabbing a mug and woke my SIL up and my gosh, you would’ve thought I murdered a child. She’s a “light sleeper” so everyone in her house has to cater to her “sleep needs”. So being aware of how fun that was, I’m using my phone as a flashlight, make coffee, and I’m sitting alone in the dining room reading on my phone. Everyone is finally up around 7:30 - my son woke up at 6:30, and I had to give him his tablet and headphones because the TV can’t be on for him or it might wake SIL up.

Car is loaded by 8:30 and I’m trying to push us out the door. The in-laws show up to tell everyone bye, so we finally get out around 9:15. On the way home, I start recapping everything with my wife who is rightfully annoyed with me and my frustrations, but agrees how ridiculous the weekend was. 

I never want to go back there again for any reason. Never in my life has visiting family felt like such a chore. Even visiting family that doesn’t cater to kids is easier than this nonsense. If the kids get loud, she freaks out and starts yelling. She absolutely snapped at my daughter and I told my wife, she has one opportunity to address this if it happens again. If she hesitates even a moment, I’m jumping in - we try to let each other manage our families to not cause a rift. My family is no picnic for us either, but I do address situations head on even if my wife doesn’t like the outcome. My mother is a whirlwind of chaos, so it’s not like I don’t have to deal with this myself. And I recognize these aren’t fun or easy conversations, but I told my wife, I won’t be back up there for a while. 

We get to see them this weekend at my In-laws for Christmas which SIL will act like nothing ever occurred at Thanksgiving. 

Hopefully, this visit goes smoother because we can stay at our own house. The in-laws are about 30 minutes from us. ",2,1766505333.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

And then it appeared: a Visitor, enormous and ethereal, hovering above the city like a storm given form. Its surface shifted between metal and shadow, bending the air around it. Cars skidded into each other. Civilians screamed and scattered. Emergency sirens rang out, too little too late. Soldiers mobilized, but their weapons seemed insignificant against the alien colossus.
Buildings shook and splintered. Windows shattered. The street beneath Noha’s feet quaked, throwing him to the ground. Around him, people vanished in bursts of light and distortion. Panic spread like wildfire, but no one could stop it.
From a high-rise observation deck, Dr. Hale watched calmly. Every order he gave over the comms sounded measured, heroic, reasonable. Yet behind the façade, his mind was already plotting. Every deployment, every tactical command, subtly nudged humanity toward a path only he and a few others understood. Humanity had survived this first encounter, but survival would become a far darker burden than they could imagine.
The Visitor withdrew by nightfall, leaving the city in ruins. Fires burned unchecked. Smoke choked the streets. Noha, trembling and covered in dust, stared at the devastation, knowing that life as it had been was gone forever.

Time Skip – Present


Decades later, the surface of Earth had become a grave. Humanity clung to life underground, in vast cities carved into the crust, beneath layers of reinforced steel and concrete. The sun was a memory; the sky, a myth. The surface was forbidden, a dangerous place for ghosts of a world that had died slowly over years of fighting.
Noha sat in AEGIS headquarters, the glow of tactical monitors washing over his face. His fingers hovered over the coordination panel, guiding squads, marking safe zones, logging casualties. He was not a soldier, not on the frontlines, but the weight of the battlefield pressed on him nonetheless. Each screen told a story of destruction: collapsed tunnels, incinerated squads, civilians trapped and lost. He memorized their names, because memory was all he had left of the living.
Another Visitor had appeared, massive and shifting, bending gravity and light. Squads deployed; many did not return. Noha’s eyes moved over the displays, calculating, coordinating, helpless. Each victory seemed hollow. Each defeat, a tragedy. And still, the battles came, relentless as the decay of the world itself.

After humanity moved underground, AEGIS began studying the distortions left behind by the Visitors—areas where sound bent and machines failed, as if the planet itself had been wounded. Dr. Hale called it resonance: a shared frequency between the Visitors and Earth.
Project LUCENT was approved to study it. Officially, the goal was simple—capture a Visitor, extract its core structure, and build a system capable of controlling or neutralizing them. SOLACE provided the funding, calling it a final hope for survival.
Deep beneath the city, a captured Visitor was suspended in containment. Its presence unsettled everyone nearby. Hale ignored the reports and focused on the data. When human neural signals synchronized with the creature’s frequency, the readings stabilized instead of collapsing.
From that discovery, the Resonance Core was created.
On paper, it was a weapon. In truth, Hale understood what it really did—it aligned all living signals into a single, quiet rhythm. No pain. No resistance. Just an ending that felt like rest.
He shared only what AEGIS needed to hear.
The rest of the truth waited.
And when Hale noticed that one young operator, Noha, could stand near the Core without flinching, he marked him quietly.
Some endings, after all, required a steady hand.

Over the following weeks, the underground city became a symphony of war. Sector 12 was engulfed in chaos as a Visitor ripped through the tunnels. Armor clanged against impossible force, yet it shattered. Soldiers fell mid-stride. Sector 7 saw evacuation squads ambushed; screams echoed through hollow conduits as civilians were lost. Sector 3’s tunnels collapsed entirely, trapping dozens beneath tons of concrete.
Noha moved like a ghost among the monitors, guiding what he could, witnessing everything he could not prevent. The names of the fallen haunted him, etched into memory like scars on his mind. Each loss deepened the gnawing realization: survival had become a form of cruelty.


Meanwhile, in the hidden chambers of power, SOLACE convened. The group of elites — scientists, philosophers, politicians — had long since realized that humanity’s continued survival was not mercy, but suffering. Dr. Hale, their secret ally within AEGIS, began manipulating the defenders with careful precision. He issued orders to capture a Visitor under the guise of weaponization, emphasizing safety protocols while hiding the true purpose of the mission.
For years, he guided humanity’s defenders toward a plan they could not comprehend. Every lie, every manipulation, was calculated to bring them closer to the inevitable end. Only the Core remained, waiting for someone with the authority to act — someone like Noha.
The signs were subtle at first. Visitors that were captured behaved curiously, observing rather than attacking. Protocols made little tactical sense. Dr. Hale’s private communications contained hints of a far-reaching plan. Slowly, as the battles continued and the casualties mounted, Noha began to piece it together.
The truth was chilling: the Visitors were not weapons. The Resonance Core was not a tool of war. It was a device to end humanity peacefully. SOLACE had decided that survival was cruelty, and Dr. Hale had agreed in secret, ensuring that the defenders remained unaware of their true purpose.
Noha’s heart sank as he realized the weight of what had been orchestrated, and the only question left was: who would give consent to activate it?
The Final Choice
The last Visitor had been captured. The Resonance Core glowed softly in the central chamber, awaiting the human touch that would decide the fate of all life. Outside, battles raged. Soldiers fell mid-strike, tunnels collapsed, and screams echoed in the dim underground corridors.
Noha approached the Core. He thought of the friends he had lost, of soldiers and civilians alike, of cities broken and lives ended. The screens reflected faces he would never forget. The full scope of humanity’s suffering pressed down on him.
He pressed the panel.
Time froze. The Visitors halted mid-motion, suspended in a quiet grace. Pain vanished. Fear dissolved. Suffering ceased. Life folded gently into silence.
Epilogue
Noha remained, the last conscious witness. The underground tunnels were still, the monitors dark. Humanity’s end had come, not with fire or chaos, but with mercy. And in that moment, Noha understood the truth of it all: sometimes, the greatest act of courage is choosing to let go.
The war was over. The world was over. And Noha, a boy who had watched from behind monitors, had chosen the final mercy for all.",1,1766505299.0,stories,0,1.0,False

I’d either skip breakfast completely, grab something sugary on the go, or drink coffee and hope for the best. By 10–11 a.m., I was tired, hungry, and already thinking about snacks. I knew breakfast mattered, but I needed something fast, filling, and realistic.

That’s what pushed me to experiment with **7 breakfast smoothie recipes to power your morning**. Not as a weight-loss trick or a “perfect routine,” but as a way to stop starting my day in chaos.

What surprised me right away is that not all breakfast smoothies work the same. Some left me starving, others spiked my energy and crashed it fast. The **7 breakfast smoothie recipes to power your morning** focus on balance — protein, fiber, and ingredients that actually support digestion and steady energy.

I didn’t change everything at once. I rotated a few smoothies during the week and paid attention to how I felt afterward. Within days, a few things stood out:

* I stayed full longer into the morning
* My energy felt steadier (less coffee dependence)
* Digestion felt calmer
* I stopped snacking mindlessly before lunch

The biggest win was how easy it became. Breakfast stopped being a decision. That’s where **7 breakfast smoothie recipes to power your morning** really helped — they removed friction. When something is simple and repeatable, you actually do it.

I also learned what *doesn’t* work. Smoothies that were mostly fruit left me hungry fast. Once I stuck to recipes with protein, healthy fats, and fiber, things changed. Breakfast started to feel like a foundation instead of a placeholder.

I followed this guide on [**7 breakfast smoothie recipes to power your morning**](https://detoxandsmoothie.com/7-breakfast-smoothie-recipes-for-energy-weight-loss-and-gut-health/) because it explains which smoothies are better for energy, weight loss, or gut health. That helped me choose based on what I needed that day instead of guessing.

Do these smoothies magically fix your life? No. But using **7 breakfast smoothie recipes to power your morning** helped me build a consistent habit that made the rest of the day easier. When breakfast is handled, everything else feels less rushed.

Now I keep 2–3 favorites in rotation and adjust ingredients depending on how active my day will be. No stress, no overthinking.

I’m curious — do you find smoothies work better than solid breakfasts for energy, or do you need something you can chew in the morning?

Some backstory. Met my partner in June 2021, had our first son in Jan 2024 and our second son June 2025. His mother is from another country (not going to specify as to not give too much away) but she grew up very rural, tribe like environment. She came to the UK at 19 and had two children, her daughter and then her son (my partner) 32 years ago. And has been in the UK for the last 33 years. 

Things were fine when we first got together, his mum is a hoarder so the house way always cluttered, unkempt. It never really made any difference to me as we didn’t go to her place much. My partner lived in a flat elsewhere before he moved in with me so we only went to hers on the odd occasion. 

We had our first Son and she came over to us a couple of times in the first 10 months of his life to see him. She lives an hour away but doesn’t drive and was too scared of public transport. (I say this, although she did get a 20 hour flight with 2 layovers to go back to her home country 2 years ago). 

When he was 10 months old I had to go back to work so MIL said she wanted to support and to do so she would come and stay with us every Monday night and be there for childcare on Tuesdays. When she started doing this, we put the baby monitor app on her phone and I VERY explicitly said that this was only to be used when she was here for nap times. 

A few months later, in the middle of the night, our son was poorly and crying lots. We were both trying to settle and soothe him when my partner gets a text from his mother. ‘Is baby ok, he’s crying so much’. This shocked me, why was she watching the baby monitor to start with. Both his parents were here with him, and we have it covered. I told my partner there and then to message her and tell her to stop watching the monitor. 

Fast forward another few months I’m about 5 months pregnant with our second child, it’s a random Saturday morning, I’m just about to head out for work when his sister texts us. ‘How are you guys doing? How is baby, we were giggling along with him last night on the baby monitor’. Excuse me!! Turns out whilst my partner was putting him to bed and having a giggle/playing with him, that my MiL and SIL were watching along too! 

I was furious, I told my partner to wait for me to get home from work so we could respond to them both together. He in fact, did not do that. So instead, messaged them both and said that I was upset and told them to not do it again. When I got home and he told me what he said, I was even more annoyed. We agreed previously to be a united front, for him to say the upset had come from me alone was unfair and not coming from us as a partnership. 

SIL messaged me and apologised and I was grateful for that. MIL did not. In fact she messaged my partner and said sorry, but nothing to me at all. She was due to come and stay with us on Monday night and this was during my partner working away so it was just the two of us there. I was so angry about the situation, given that she’s been told multiple times not to watch the baby monitor that I made plans to go and see some friends when she came over. She walked in and looked at me and said, oh sorry about the monitor, it was an accident. She claimed that she clicked on the notification and then watched it accidentally when it came up. Now, we all know that’s untrue as she was watching purposefully previously. So her apology seemed incredibly fake to me. 

I told her that it wasn’t true and I knew she’d been watching it several times before and she went quiet. She’d been caught out. Over the next few weeks it was incredibly awkward everytime she would come and stay. We ended up trying to hash it out. I told her how upset I was at this betrayal of privacy, that I could have easily been walking around in nothing and I didn’t want her having an access point into our home. Her response to this was ‘well you could put a camera in my home, I don’t care. I have nothing to hide’. This to me proved that she just didn’t get it or didn’t care about my privacy at all. I knew then that I would never get a reasonable apology. 

A few weeks later we had another conversation with my partner present to lay down the ground rules and finally put it to bed. I felt better, that hopefully after this, she would respect our boundaries a little bit more. 

Time passes, the bond between his mum and I had been a bit frosty but I feel like that’s to be expected after a bit of tension. I told her that during my maternity leave with our second son that she wouldn’t need to come up every Monday night. I will say, hosting her has been quite tedious every week, especially as I got more and more pregnant, making her dinners and running around after her. She’s also a messy person and would leave tissues every where and orange peels. Every week I’d have to do a round up of the house and clear stuff away. So having some time to myself, getting used to our newborn bubble and being a mum of two felt like a good idea. I still made plans with her so she could see her grandchildren. 

When my second was born, we FaceTimed MIL and SIL in the hospital, to my surprise SIL was not interested in meeting him at all. At the time we called they were on the beach, queueing for a coffee somewhere. She said the signal was bad and that MIL was going to find some reception but that she didn’t was to lose her place in the queue. She never called back to meet him at a later date. Days later, I’ve just got home and a bit more settled after my C-section. My partner decides to invite MiL over for 6 hours to see my eldest and meet the baby. I was literally having to host and make her tea whilst she held my newborn. She then spilt her mug everywhere and just sat there whilst I had to get on the floor and clean it up. Thought the whole day was really strange. 

Months passed and SIL still hadn’t met our newborn, I said how strange this was to my partner and he agreed. He messaged her and she said it would be better for them to meet separately. He went over to her place and came home with a big shocker. 

The reason she couldn’t bare to come and meet our newborn was because she was mad at me. And has been for months, ever since I told her mum off for watching our baby monitor. She was that I went in on their mum too much and was clearly out to get her. I wouldn’t have treated her like that unless there was a reason to and because their mum is black, I must be racist. 

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing, for the past 5 months, my MiL and SIL had been bitching about me and calling me racist behind my back, letting it impact them meeting their grandson/nephew. All because I didn’t want my home and my privacy invaded and called out bad behaviour. 

My partner (albeit caught in the middle) wasn’t very good at supporting or defending me to start with, it took him a whole month to realise that what there were saying was incredibly damaging to me and for him to realise that they’ve never treated me very well. They’ve always questioned when we’ve done things (moved in together, had our first miscarriage, our first son and the second!) 

What I am struggling with so much is that they’ve let it go on for so long. It was my MiL who went back to her daughter and said all these awful things about me and how I’ve mistreated her which has let them to bring up race. But for my SIL to willingly believe I would ever do such a thing and not come to me at all to hear my side of things is just hurtful. Neither of them have any respect for me, it’s hurting our family dynamic and my relationship! I don’t take what they said lightly. I do my best to make sure that I stand up for minorities, I support lgbtqia, Black Lives Matter, Palestine, I share information on how to support the causes online, I read and research how to be a stronger ally. All of this and they have the nerve to tell me I’ve been racist. 

The trust has well and truly been broken and I don’t see a way forward. We did all meet to discuss it and they quickly back tracked and said they didn’t think I was a racist anymore but that instead I just had unconscious bias. (Just as bad if you ask me.) I don’t see a way forward and now my relationship with my partner is suffering. I don’t trust my MiL and don’t want them around my children, but I know it’s not just up to me. I just don’t think it’s right for them to disrespect me as their mother and then want access to my children like nothing happened? 

It’s a long read, so thank you for getting this far. Thoughts and opinions welcome. I know I have an emotional stake in all of this so it’s probably going to come off a little one sided but I’ve tried to remain as factual as possible about the events. 

Edit/ I’m just going to add here, I did remove MIL’s access to the monitor after the second occasion when her and SIL were watching together. Just booted her off the app immediately! Hindsight is a wonderful thing, it obviously would have been better to do it after the first incident. She doesn’t use the app any longer and when providing childcare before I went on maternity leave went back to the old fashioned method of just listening out for him and checking in!

istfg everyone in my life cares so much about what others think of them, and it drives me INSANE. 

maybe it’s because i’m autistic so my brain doesn’t work the same, or maybe i’m the normal one and everyone else is insane (i think it’s the latter tbh) but my roommates are constantly talking about how they wish they could go out and do xyz (like eat at a restaurant or go to a coffee shop) by themselves but they can’t because “everyone” will see them and it will be “embarrassing.” they’re my age. and my mom is aghast when i go outside to walk the dog in a rural area in PJ pants at 9pm. 

i’m 22f and i don’t give a single fuck??? why the hell should i care about going to do shit by myself??? i go to coffee shops alone all the time. eating in a restaurant alone is amazing. i don’t care if some stranger i’ll never see again sees me in pj pants and goes “oooh wow look at this girl in public in pjs walking her dog, how embarrassing.” why would i? they’re a STRANGER. they don’t know me and i don’t know them and they can talk shit about me to whoever they want and it will never affect my life??? so who cares!

another example is when i was in a major city recently that had scam artists, i never had an issue telling them to fuck off if they persisted after a curt “no.” and my parents thought i was insane for saying fuck off because it’s not polite. WHY. WHY IS THAT INSANE. THEYRE TRYING TO SCAM YOU AND YOURE BEING POLITE. YOU KNOW THEYRE SCAMMERS. god i just agsgqororjkflgkgnd

the thing that is pissing me off is how much people bring stuff i do up as if i personally should be ashamed. like i’ll say oh i have a paper due so im headed to xyz coffee shop, and my roommate will go “that’s so brave going alone i could never do that i’d be so scared of what everyone thinks” and it’s like … okay girl. 

or my mom will see me heading out to drive to xyz place (im in jeans and a sweater) and she will say “you’re going to go out? don’t you want to… change first?” because she hates when i wear shirts and sweaters that are a size too big because she thinks it “looks bad.” and every time without fail i go “no, i look hot as fuck today” and just leave. idk why she keeps trying to get me to change my mind. i don’t care if it looks bad to you. i am not dressing for you. i dress for myself. i don’t even think about what i wear most days because it’s just clothes. i don’t care. i don’t care! 

i just don’t understand how exhausting it must be to live every fucking second of your life for other people. like jesus fucking CHRIST can you do ANYTHING yourself? can you make a single fucking decision????? or do you need the permission of every single person within a 10 mile radius before making a decision since it might be too embarrassing? my god.

1ptx5mn,https://geminiprompt.id/#blog/can-you-monetize-images-created-with-gemini-ai,Can You Monetize Images Created with Gemini AI?,"Okay, look. It’s Saturday morning, I’m on my second cup of cold brew (which is arguably too strong), and I’m staring at a folder on my desktop labeled ""Gemini Experiments.""

It’s got about 400 images in it. Some are absolute trash—seriously, why does AI still struggle with hands sometimes?—but a solid chunk of them are actually... really good. Like, ""I would buy this as a poster"" good.

And that brings up the question I see pop up in my DMs and Reddit threads constantly: **Can I actually make money off this stuff?**

I’ve been messing around with AI art generators for about two years now—mostly Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, but lately, I’ve been deep-diving into Gemini because, honestly, the convenience of having it right there in the Google ecosystem is hard to beat. But when it comes to the legal side of things? Man, it’s a headache.

So, let’s talk about it. No lawyer-speak, just what I’ve figured out after way too many hours reading terms of service pages when I should have been sleeping.



# The Short Answer (with a giant asterisk)



Yes. You can monetize images created with Gemini.

Google’s Terms of Service for their generative AI tools generally state that **you own the rights to the content you generate.** This means you can stick that sci-fi landscape on a t-shirt, use that generated logo for a client, or sell stock assets.

**But.** (There’s always a ""but,"" right?)

Here’s the thing that trips people up—and honestly, it tripped me up when I first started trying to sell prints on Etsy. **Ownership is not the same thing as Copyright.**

In the US (and it’s looking similar in the UK/AU/CA mostly), the Copyright Office has been pretty clear: if a human didn't make it, it can't be copyrighted.

So, scenario time:  
You make a killer image of a cyberpunk raccoon using Gemini. You put it on a mug and sell it. That’s legal. You keep the profit.  
However, if I come along, buy your mug, scan the image, and start selling my own t-shirts with *your* raccoon on it... there’s not a whole lot you can do about it legally. You don't own the copyright because a machine ""painted"" it.

Does that stop me? No.  
Does it stop the thousands of people making bank on Redbubble right now? Absolutely not.

Most people aren't out to steal your specific AI image. They’re too busy trying to generate their own. So while the copyright protection is weak, the monetization potential is very real.



# The ""Quality"" Trap



Here’s where most people fail, though. They think they can type ""cat eating pizza,"" get a mediocre image, slap it on a canvas, and retire.

I tried this. Spoiler: I made zero dollars.

The market is flooded. Drowning, actually. To monetize Gemini images, you need to produce stuff that doesn't *look* like generic AI slop. You need distinct styles, consistent lighting, and compositions that actually make sense.

This is where I started cheating a little bit (okay, it's not cheating, it's working smarter).

I used to spend hours tweaking a prompt, changing one word, regenerating, and getting frustrated. Now? I usually start with an image I actually like—maybe a photo I took or a style I found—and I run it through the [Image-to-Prompt](https://geminiprompt.id/#image-to-prompt) tool here. It breaks down *why* an image looks good so I can feed that logic back into Gemini.

It’s kind of wild how much better the output gets when you stop guessing and start using the actual descriptive keywords the AI understands.



# Ideas That Actually Make Money (Because I've Tried Them)



So, assuming you’ve got the rights (you do) and you’ve got the quality (work on it), what do you actually *do*?



1. **Stock Photography Assets**
2.  
3. This is the big one. Adobe Stock actually accepts AI images now, provided you label them correctly. The trick is specificity. Don't make ""woman smiling."" Make ""cybersecurity analyst looking stressed at a monitor in a blue-lit server room, cinematic lighting.""
4.  
5.  
6. *Pro tip:*
7.  
8. If your prompt is weak, the eyes will be dead. I use the
9.  
10. [Enhance Prompt](https://geminiprompt.id/#enhance)
11.  
12. tool when I have a basic idea but need it to sound like a professional photographer wrote it. It adds all those technical camera terms I always forget.
13. **Print on Demand (POD)**
14.  
15. Etsy, Redbubble, Society6. I have a small shop that sells niche stickers. I’m not retiring on it, but it pays for my coffee habit. The key here is finding a ""vibe"" and sticking to it. Don't be the ""everything store."" Be the ""retro 80s vaporwave synthwave toaster store."" Okay, maybe not that specific, but you get me.
16. **Client Work / Storyboarding**

I have a buddy who works in video production. He uses Gemini exclusively for storyboards and pitch decks. He used to hire sketch artists (expensive, slow). Now he generates the shots to show the client the ""mood."" He charges for the *pitch deck*, and the images are part of that value.





# When Gemini Refuses to Cooperate



We gotta talk about the elephant in the room. Gemini has... personality. And by personality, I mean it has guardrails that are sometimes annoying as heck.

You try to generate something slightly edgy or in a specific artistic style, and it gives you that polite refusal message. ""I can't do that, Dave."" (It doesn't say Dave, but it feels like it).

It’s usually because the prompt is triggering a safety filter, even if you didn't mean to. Or it's just too vague.

I’ve found that structuring the prompt visually helps bypass the confusion. Instead of a run-on sentence, I use the [Build Prompt](https://geminiprompt.id/#build-prompt) structure. It forces you to separate the subject, the style, the lighting, and the camera angle. When you feed Gemini a structured request, it seems to treat it more like a technical command and less like a conversational request it needs to ""judge.""

And honestly? Sometimes you just hit a wall. I spent three hours last Tuesday trying to get a specific texture of velvet—just velvet!—and it kept looking like plastic. I eventually gave up and went for a denim look instead. Sometimes you just gotta pivot.



# Is It Worth It?



Look, if you think you’re going to type three words and become a millionaire, you’re dreaming. That window closed about 18 months ago.

But if you treat Gemini as a tool—like a camera or a paintbrush—and you put in the effort to learn the language of prompting? Yeah. You can monetize it.

The barrier to entry is low, which means the competition is high. Your edge is your taste and your ability to control the AI.

If you’re staring at a blank text box feeling uninspired (been there), just hit up the [Prompt Generator](https://geminiprompt.id/#generator) to get the gears turning. Sometimes seeing a random, complex prompt is all it takes to spark a new collection idea.

Anyway, my coffee is gone, and I have about 50 more images to cull through. Go make something cool, sell it, and don't worry too much about the copyright police unless you’re trying to sell Mickey Mouse merch. (Seriously, don't do that. Disney will find you).

I have the bambino plus and the baratza encore grinder (I know this isn’t the best, I have the DF54 on the way but it’s on back order). I brew double shots with a dose of 16g (freshly roasted medium roast from Trade) and I manually pull my shot instead of just hitting the double shot button on the bambino (pre infusion 7-8 seconds). I am for a 1:2 ratio so while I pay attention to the time I focus on 32g more.

My issue is that the espresso appears too be too runny/pour too quickly which makes me think my grind is too coarse, but my volume of liquid appears quite low for a double espresso and my puck usually appears a bit water logged which makes me think the grind is too fine. I’m still learning about bitter vs sour coffee, so all I can say is it doesn’t taste right lol. The words I would use are that it tastes a bit acidic perhaps, and not the smooth experience I’m looking for.

I’m pretty good at adding \*\*most\*\* beans, so that’s close to accurate. Def not good at adding all brews so that’s off by quite a bit. 

I’m not going to lie though, some of this surprised me:

—If someone asked me my country breakdown, no way I would have thought Colombia was so dominant. I knew I had a lot of Colombian coffee, and if I had to pick one country to source from that would probably be it because of the incredible diversity of beans and processing styles… \*\*But wouldn’t have quite guessed that 40% of the beans I bought in 2025 were Colombian.\*\*

—\*\*Also wouldn’t have guessed I drank so many damn Geshas!\*\* lol Though from looking at my pocketbook I should’ve known… 😁 I know some people knock Geshas as just being hype and overpriced - but they’re so wrong. I don’t think any other bean of similar quality can compete against a top Gesha for depth and complexity and blow your mind florals. 

—\*\*No shocker SEY is my top Roaster\*\* (though how did I forget to log so many bags?). I’ve cycled through so many subscriptions, always deciding at some point I’m ready to try something new and move on even when the beans are great (e.g. September, Tim Wendelboe, Black & White, Onyx, others….). But not SEY. \*\*Think I’ll have that sub for life.\*\* Simply no better more consistent roaster for the money out there IMO.

I tried everything—therapy, medication, breathing exercises—and nothing stuck because they all felt like too much work.

Then I found something that actually works in 5 minutes:

**The technique (no mysticism, just neurology):**

1. **Ground yourself first (2 minutes)**
   - Name 5 things you can see
   - Name 4 things you can touch
   - Name 3 things you can hear
   - Name 2 things you can smell
   - Name 1 thing you can taste
   - This stops the anxiety spiral by forcing your brain to the present

2. **Box breathing (3 minutes)**
   - Breathe in for 4 counts
   - Hold for 4 counts
   - Breathe out for 4 counts
   - Hold for 4 counts
   - Repeat 5 times
   - Your nervous system can't stay panicked while doing this (I know because I test my limits stupidly often)

**Why this works when other stuff didn't:**

- No meditation experience required (I still can't empty my mind)
- No spirituality needed
- No apps or special setup
- Works while driving, at your desk, in meetings
- Takes less time than a coffee break
- The grounding part interrupts the panic loop immediately

**The science part:**

Your panic is your amygdala (fear center) screaming while your prefrontal cortex (logic) is offline. Grounding forces prefrontal engagement. Box breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system. Together, they're like flipping a switch.

**Real talk:**

This doesn't eliminate anxiety. But it stops panic attacks in about 70% of my cases. For the 30% it doesn't catch, it makes them shorter and less intense.

Do it twice a day for 2 weeks (even when you're not panicking) so your body recognizes the pattern. Then use it only when you need it.

That's it. No life overhaul. Just 5 minutes.",0,1766504660.0,Meditation,5,0.5,False

	1.	You pay cash up front.
Breakfast is like $12/person now (biscuit + coffee + hash brown).


	2.	They “pay you back” in points (IOUs).
You spend $12 → you earn points. Sounds fair.


	3.	But the “interest rate” is trash.
A simple coffee costs like 3,000 points.
That’s not a reward, that’s them pricing the repayment insanely high.


	4.	Then they cap how much of the debt they’ll repay per visit.
You can only redeem 1 reward per order.
So even if you’ve “earned” a pile of points, you can only cash out a tiny portion at a time.


	5.	And they add a cooldown to stop you from cashing out multiple times.
There’s a 15-minute wait (sometimes longer) between orders/deals.
So you can’t just split your order into 3–4 smaller orders to use multiple rewards without wasting your life in the parking lot.


	6.	Result: you earn points faster than you’re allowed to spend them.
Every visit adds more “debt owed to you,” but the app throttles repayment so hard you can’t ever catch up.


	7.	That’s why the points feel useless.
They’ve created a system where they hold a growing IOU balance to you (a liability)…
but they structure it so most people never redeem much of it.

So, we have this website that randomly picks secret Santas for us and I’ve got my co worker (god knows what age, female) from Finances. Now good thing is that you can anonymously ask them what they want as a gift or give you some clues. I’ve definitely met her in the office but haven’t really had any contact besides hello and goodbye. I think she’s cute and pretty and probably a good person too, I just don’t talk to people unless they talk to me first. I usually struggle with starting friendships or just simply, getting to know people. 
   She said she liked some beauty products (such as makeup and self-care products, or silver jewelry). Since I don’t know her skin type or anything about it and also our budget is pretty tight, I couldn’t find anything beautiful for her but I bought her some self-care stuff that I think she’s gonna like it.

In my office, everyone knows me as a jokester, so I thought, why don’t we have some fun?  I’ve decided to get her some funny stuff but I think I took it too far that I’ve hurt her feelings.

 First thing I bought was batteries. I thought it would be funny, to just buy batteries and leave a little note that says: “Gift is not included.” That day, I heard her seeing that on her table and giggling. When I got the sense that she got the joke, I liked it and kept going. Next week, I got her a tiny notebook that says: “For All Of Your Big Ideas”. She laughed at it too. She genuinely liked it. So as brutal I am, the very next week, I got her Certificate that says “Most Likely to Be Replaced by AI” with some Chocolates beside it. Now, I’m sitting there and enjoying my coffee and being excited that it’ll make her laugh. I heard her coming into the office and it’s a pure silence. I was concerned but I left it there, I didn’t think much of it. 

On certain days every week, we have a small little Happy Hour where everyone stops working, having some pizzas and sodas on our brake and chat and etc. While I was there, enjoying my food, I’ve heard her saying “Someone left this paper on my desk” with some cracky voice that felt like she was crying. Because the whole point of playing “Secret Santa” I didn’t want to directly go to her and ask her if it was because of my “prank” but it also matters for me, because I really didn’t think it was such a big deal.

Because I'm there so regularly, the staff knows me and Pepper, and sometimes we have friendly chats. Pepper is older and calm, and usually just lies by my feet and sleeps.

Today I came there with Pepper, and there was another lady with a little dachshund. When the dachshund saw Pepper, he LOST IT. Started barking his head off, very loudly. 

Pepper ignored it as he always does, and we sat down at a table as far away as possible. However since the cafe is very small we were still in the dachshund's line of sight, and he wouldn't stop barking despite the lady's attempts to calm him down. 

Other patrons started complaining, and she said I should leave to restore the quiet. I told her, if anything she should leave, because it's her dog that is causing the drama. She involved the staff, who looked at me, and then asked her to leave. 

She left but told me that I'm having her kicked out by playing the ""favorites card"" with the staff who knows me and not her, and it's really unfair because according to her, she was there first and everything was fine before I came.

Mine is a 2025, the other one I don't know but it was a FWD version.

It was cold yesterday (-10C or about 14F), I was on a road trip and needed a top-up. Wasn't particularly low at 45% SoC but that wasn't enough to get back home.

Found a pair of 120kW chargers, there was already a FWD bZ4X charging. I noticed his speed was 26kW... I was like... that's gonna take a while. But I plugged in and yeah it started at like 19-20, but quickly went over 30, eventually reached 44kW. In the cold for an AWD with the battery over 40%, not too shabby. His never went past 27kW from what I could see, he was still there an hour later waiting, poor guy.

I thought, perhaps he was already passed 80% and waiting to reach 100%, but he was there over an hour. When we came back to our car we were at 85% SoC and still getting 33kW.

Only other theory I have is: he had the car ""on"" and warming the cabin. We initially turned heat off and just had the seat warmers on. Eventually we turned the car off and went for a walk and a coffee. I've heard that to get the best speeds in the cold, you have to turn the heat off for at least 10-15 minutes so it can redirect all the heat to the battery. 

If that's the case... fellow bZ4X owner who wasted probably 2h yesterday at the charger (based on the dealer decal on the car, he was far from home), please turn the car off a bit next time! Poor you. He looked miserable.",2,1766504273.0,BZ4X,1,0.75,False

Right away, you’d never know the resort had been hit by a hurricane. The resort looked immaculate, everything felt open and fully staffed, and the service was top notch from the moment we landed. We used Mobay airport service, which was 100% worth it and saved us a couple of hours in customs. From walking out of the airport to being in the van with a drink in hand took about 15 minutes, which instantly set the tone for the trip.

Check in was incredibly easy. Staff kept telling me to sit down and relax while they handled everything, which really made it feel like a true luxury experience, especially compared to some other all inclusive resorts we’ve done in Mexico.

Our Bamboo Grove swim up room with concierge service was beautiful and felt brand new. It was quiet day and night, and while the pool was a little cool on a rainy day, it was perfect once the sun came out. I’m not someone who likes cold pools, and this one hit the sweet spot.

We also did a vow renewal during the trip, and they made my wife feel special the entire time. She was glowing. We did a couples massage at the Red Lane Spa, and she had her hair and makeup done there as well. Everything went smoothly, and she came back in a great mood, which says a lot after spending a couple of hours getting ready.

The vow renewal itself was just the two of us, and it was simple, intimate, and really well done. If anyone is considering it, we were very happy with how it turned out.

Food was very good overall. Like any all inclusive, there were some hits and misses, but Bayside and Bravo were both excellent. We had snapper at Sundowner for lunch and really enjoyed it. Breakfast at Barefoot by the Sea was good, though service was a little slow that day, which wasn’t typical. Room service was solid, but the restaurant food was better. One of our favorite things was the café with espresso, cappuccinos, ice cream, and coffee drinks. Having that available all day was a great touch.

The only thing we’d probably skip next time was the candlelight dinner on the beach. It was included in our package, and I’m glad we didn’t pay extra for it. There were some small issues, and while the staff tried their best, it just didn’t fully come together.

Overall, this was a fantastic trip and easily one of our best vacations. We’ve stayed at some really nice places in Aruba and Mexico, and this was right up there with the best of them. We enjoyed it so much that we actually booked another Sandals trip while we were there for next year. That alone says how happy we were with the experience.

Im up drinking my morning coffee and selling some last minute e-gift cards.  Over the years we have seen the detailing industry explode in popularity not just amongst consumers but amongst people that want to start a detailing business.  There is a BIG difference between the businesses that have their shit in order and the ones that think it's just a walk in the park to start the detailing business so let's go to walmart or harbor freight to get everything we need and now you are officially a mobile detailing business.

The truth is that you have to start somewhere however, seeing a lot of post on facebook, IG, and reddit of people with their basket filled to the top with detailing products sometimes has me thinking about the already over-saturated industry.  This reminds me of how the home cleaning services became over-saturated where i would be detailing a client's car and a car filled with spanish women pop out with vacuums, mops and fabuloso bottles.  These home cleaning services were everywhere and i can imagine the already established businesses saw a decline in revenue at how there were just so many options.

The same thing with landscapers.  I can't get away from them but every time i turn around the leaf blowers are firing up and there is a landscaper at every corner literally.  I remember wrapping up on a vehicle and as i drove down the street there was 8 different landscaper businesses. This over saturation is not something i particularly worry about but it's something i think about. Already in my area there are over 50 detailers.  5 years from now that number could be 250 detailers in my area.  At some point there will be more detailers than detailing services needed.

Now the good thing here is that many newbies that open up a detailing business and learn that there is more to this than they thought end up making mistakes and sometimes big mistakes and that can be work for us established.  One mistake is that many of these people go these companies that custom build detailing vans and they apply for the loan and although they now have a decked out mobile detailing van. Unfortunately they can not even make the payments because they can barely get customers. I can't even tell you how many people have come into this forum asking how to get customers.  Yes it may be an easy and cheap entry into starting a detailing business but what about acquiring those customers when you first start?Truth here is that many new, less professional businesses may drop like flies due to the burnout, poor pricing sstructure and lack of business acumen.

Years ago this probably would not have been an issue for newbies because mobile detailing was not over-saturated.  I remember customers or people that would walk by say ""Oh wow, mobile detailing. What a great idea. I've never knew of something like this"".  Now we hear ""oh my buddy's got a detailing business down in such and such"". Over the years i have built a client list of over 2,000 client contacts some of which some stayed subscribed and some unsubscribed. It is what it is but the point here is that it is hard to build such a list now a days if you are just starting out. I have found a few ways to stand out and it has nothing to do with lowering my prices which i'll never do, however it remains a thought of what happens 5 years from now when every household has a detailer.

Something is there with the classic K-Dramas from the golden generation (I'm considering those released between 2000-2010 to be precise) that pulls you closer on every watch. That era is so famous for producing great classics like 'Coffee Prince' and 'Boys Over Flowers' and some high-profile emotional classics like 'What happened in Bali' and 'Stairway to Heaven', which created an international wave of K-Drama fans.

So, which classic K-drama's remake would you like to see in today's time?

My take: I would like to see the remake of 'Winter Sonata' (2002) because there are many new-gen emotional and heartbreaking romantic dramas, but these dramas exist because of the success of 'Winter Sonata', which created a perfect blueprint. Remaking it in today's time would not only give a sense of nostalgia for the fans, but also would give today's generation a change in taste in terms of unfulfilled love.

The other contenders are 'Coffee Prince' (2007) and 'Save the last dance for me' (2004).

The beginning of this year cut me deep & made something in me snap. I'd always been the skinny guy in the group. However, I realized I was sliding hard into bad habits and was slowly but surely heading towards a negative cardiovascular event of some kind.

I decided to make a change for the better 6 months ago, and I feel better for having done so. I can run faster than I did in HS & lift harder than I did in my service.

*For reference I am 5'11 (180cm) & my starting weight was 213lbs (96kg) I am now 163lbs (73kg).*

**What I did/am doing:**

***- For the first 3-4 months I did 18:6 IF*** eating between 12pm & 6pm. I was at roughly a 500-600 calorie deficit for most of this time. At 6 months, I sort of still stick to this but not as stringently. I am now at my maintenance calories most days with some days in a deficit as it's hard to meet maintenance in an IF window sometimes.

\- I ate my goal body weight in protein every single day & am still doing so now. I usually eat low fat, low carb high in protein meals.

\- I completely removed processed sugar from my diet which was extremely soul crushing & eye opening at first on how much I depended on sugar. I learned that the morning coffee wasn't what I was addicted to, but the sugar and creamer I was putting in it.

\- I have never missed a day walking 10-15k steps, I have truly found a love for walking. Since June I have walked a distance roughly akin to walking from Miami to Boston (around 9.5 miles a day)

\- 7-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep, no excuses

**My exercise routine:**

Monday: Chest Day, 10k steps

Tuesday: Rest/HIIT/10k steps

Wednesday: Leg Day, 10k steps

Thursday: Rest/HIIT/10k steps

Friday: Arm Day, 10k steps

Saturday: Rest/HIIT/10k steps

Sunday: 10k steps (Full Rest)

As for my walks here is a typical walk at the park for me:

* **Workout Time**: 1:29:20
* **Elapsed Time**: 1:29:55
* **Distance**: 6.04 mi
* **Active Calories**: 643 kcal
* **Total Calories**: 790 kcal
* **Elevation Gain**: 722 ft
* **Avg. Pace**: 14'47""/mi
* **Avg. Heart Rate**: 112 bpm

I don't recommend going cold turkey into the working out if this is something you'd like to mirror unless you know what you're getting yourself into. This is not my first rodeo when it comes to exercise and I was well aware of what it'd take to maintain this kind of consistency fitness wise.

I’m nearly 40 and, like a lot of people, I’ve hit a wall with how we’re meant to meet people at this stage of life. Large social groups feel loud, shallow, and direction-less. Dating apps just feel rushed and transactional. I've met a lot of people, but rarely get to actually *know* anyone. Add remote work, isolation, and everyone being scattered across different life phases, and it can feel strangely hard to build anything real, even when you’re open and willing.

Because of that, I recently started experimenting with a small, intentional WhatsApp group in North London for people in their 30s and 40s who want something slower and more human. It’s not specifically a dating group, but more of a place to build meaningful connections with others whether that becomes friendship, companionship, or something deeper.

So, the group works in two connected layers:

Ongoing conversation in the WhatsApp group, using topics or questions to remove the pressure of small talk and help people share how they think, feel, and experience the world over a shared topic. It’s less about opinions and more about perspective, how someone sees things, what matters to them, how they approach life. Over time, that builds familiarity.

Then there are occasional in-person meetups in small groups, usually around six people. Coffee, walks, cinema, drinks, hikes, nothing forced or heavy. The point is that you’re meeting people who already feel a bit familiar, rather than starting from zero each time. It’s meant to mirror how connection used to form more naturally at uni or work, through shared context, continuity, and time.

When I first posted about the idea on Reddit (about a week ago) to see if there was any interest at all, I honestly didn’t expect much. Instead, over 30 people joined in a single day and I had to take the post down because it quickly became more than I could handle at the time as adding people is selective and done manually. I still have another 30+ messages I haven’t replied to. I didn’t expect there to be such an appetite for this kind of thing, but it also made me realise I needed to slow down and focus on quality rather than quantity. I even met a few of the guys/girls and it was an awesome experience.

But here’s where I’m stuck. It seems the vision resonates, but sustaining engagement has been harder than I expected. A few people chat, then things go quiet, and I end up carrying most of the energy. That’s starting to feel exhausting, and I’m trying to understand whether this is just the reality of trying to build something different, or whether there’s something I’m missing.

So I’m genuinely curious:  
– If you’ve been part of groups that actually worked, what helped engagement feel shared rather than driven by one person?  
– What would make *you* feel comfortable speaking up and staying involved in a space like this?

And honestly, if anyone reading this is reflective, chatty, and genuinely looking to build real connection at this stage of life, and the idea resonates, I’m seriously open to hearing from you. Not to recruit numbers, but to find people who see and value the vision I have and actually want to help shape something intentional and human by driving engagement.

I’m posting this here because a lot of what motivated this comes from the same challenges I see shared in this subreddit, people wanting friendship, community, and connection that goes beyond surface-level interaction. This started from a personal place, not as a project, but as an attempt to create the kind of environment I kept wishing existed.",1,1766503446.0,MakeFriendsOver30,1,1.0,False

Fashion Philosophy:

In my mind I’m runway couture, I have learned a lot about fashion, form, and fit, but in practice I’m mostly jeans and a T-shirt dude. As I age, I have focused on buying whole fiber, heritage quality clothing. Part of my purchasing practice is buying (as best I can) ethically made and sourced clothing with an emphasis on NA and EU manufactured goods. I also love buying vintage and second hand goods. Being able to further the use of clothing is great way to make a positive impact.

Mostly, I’m wearing every day average dude fits that are slightly elevated. My fashion identity is bit of a combination of many things; punk, New England Prep, aging hipster, a little European (when I find stuff that fits), and street. I love timeless looks, but there is nothing wrong with a little individuality and added flair. I believe this is accomplished easily with showing a little care and thoughtfulness. 

Knowing your measurements, and understanding how clothes fit in relation to those measurements is the key to dressing well. Everyone here should buy a soft measuring tape (found in many $5 sewing kits), and learn how to take your measurements.

I have put a ton of time and effort into learning about clothes and myself. I don’t really pull punches when discussing these things. Speaking directly and honestly is a quality that should be valued. ",21,1766503311.0,bigmenfashionadvice,5,1.0,False
1ptwja8,https://i.redd.it/85xqshzr0z8g1.jpeg,I thought I got a good deal on a house; I think it got a good deal on me.,"I cut it close, moving in the night before starting my new job. The deal had that too-good-to-be-true feeling; the owner even let me move in a week early. No questions asked.

The house had belonged to her mother, apparently too old to care for herself. I was just relieved she hadn’t died inside—though I might have taken it anyway. She was desperate to unload it, and I was too eager to sign the papers sight unseen. Sure, it might need work, but for the price and the commute?



I told myself I could live with whatever fate waited inside.



On the drive, excitement turned to boredom, then exhaustion. By the time I got there, the motivation to unpack had left me. Old street lamps lit a sleepy neighborhood, silent, desolate.

The only thing that seemed out of place was the woman sneaking in through the screeching back door. Me. I’d get the keys soon; until then I could only lock the door from inside. The deadbolt clicked, sending a shiver up my spine as I trapped myself in.



It smelled like my grandmother’s house—musty fabrics, faintly sweet scents I couldn’t place. My hands wandered along the walls until I found the switch. Weak yellow light froze me in place as it filled the crowded living room.

The owner had mentioned *some* things were left behind, but all this? Knickknacks and clutter crowded every surface. Was I in the right house?



I took a careful look around. She must’ve collected everything but pictures—not a single framed photograph of the old woman or any loved ones in sight. Strange. My face would’ve been on every wall, had it been *my* grandmother’s house.



I couldn’t shake the feeling I wasn’t alone. A quick peek up the staircase did little to ease me. Tonight—I’d take my chances on the couch. My body folded to fit between the arms. I tossed and turned, eventually facing the fireplace.

Out of the black, two eyes caught the faint light. Stubborn embers in a dead fire, I told myself, until they blinked. 



As tired as I was, sleep wouldn’t come easy in a stranger’s home.



It was difficult getting up before the sun did. On top of my new schedule, I had a lot to get used to. I rubbed my neck and twisted my back, pulling myself up the stairs. Each step seemed to shave a year off my life.

The master bedroom felt lived in—drawers hung slightly open, pillows and blankets disturbed, the bed sagged like the weight of a body still pressed in. I settled on the springy mattress in the spare. Anything would be an upgrade from the tiny sofa.



I called the owner on my way to work, forgetting she was three hours behind. I left a message about the belongings and turned off my phone.

It was a rough first day—with just a few hours of sleep, last night’s weirdness still lingering.



After clocking out, I saw a couple of missed calls and a voicemail. I played it on the short drive back to the property.



“Hey! Sorry about all the junk. Whatever you don’t want to keep, just toss it. Give me a call if there’s anything else I can do. Well… anything I can do from all the way over here. Cheers!”



I still felt too drained to unpack, let alone start sorting through all the crap I’d apparently inherited.

I didn’t have the energy to hunt for a kitchen light switch—the fridge practically blinded me when I opened it. I braced for rotten smells and fuzzy green leftovers, but once my eyes adjusted, everything looked…*fresh.*



I grabbed the ranch dressing and a bowl of vegetables wrapped in plastic. I sat on the sagging floral sofa, dipping carrots and celery. The classic movie channel hummed on a tiny TV.

I felt like I’d aged forty years in one night. Was this what my life would be like—until I was too old to take care of myself? I wondered if I’d end up in the same nursing home down the road.



I tried not to think about the house—the poor old woman who’d left her entire life behind, the busy daughter who held no sentiment for her mother’s belongings. How long had she really been gone before the house went on the market?

I didn’t start a new life; I’d stepped into someone else’s. The second I let my eyes drift shut, my alarm blared—it was morning all over again.



The couch was eating me alive. I couldn’t afford to spend another night downstairs. I reached out to the lamp on the coffee table and pulled the chain.



That’s when I saw it—the dead dog. No. It definitely moved. 



I was shocked to discover a grey poodle, blind, deaf, and matted. It looked decrepit, clinging to life with a bell dangling from its collar.

My fear turned to anger as I dialed the owner’s number again and again. I didn’t care what time it was for her. I’d had enough. By the time she called me back, I’d calmed down slightly.



“Oh my god, Elliot? I never would’ve imagined that old thing was still alive…” Her worry-free tone was getting under my skin.



“She must’ve really left in a hurry. What exactly happened to her?” I asked, as calmly as I could manage.



“Oh, she’s been having these little accidents, the hospital suggested she be put…”



“Accident?” I asked before she could brush it aside.



“A tiny little cut. It was nothing. Look. Take the dog to a shelter—I’ll cover the bill. No more surprises, I promise.”



Just send the dog away? That was her solution? Hand all your problems over to someone else—is that what she did with her mom?



I found some dog food in the pantry and poured it into the bowl. When I went to refill the water I noticed the mess; blood all over the sink, the counter, the floor. A little cut?



I couldn’t believe I called out of work on my *second* day, but I was determined to take my house back. I shoveled most of the glass decorations into the trash, keeping only the ones I liked.

I lit the fireplace and fed it all the old mail that wasn’t mine. I must’ve burned over a dozen names. For a house with no pictures, there sure were a lot of people who used to live here.

My joints ached as I scrubbed blood from the grout between the tiles.



Once the kitchen was spotless, I drew a hot bath in the large claw tub. My thoughts muffled as my head sank below the waterline—the house was finally quiet.



I wrapped myself in a decorative towel and sat at the antique vanity. It was beautiful, the ornate frame that matched the fancy brush. I dragged it through my hair, reluctantly accepting the new grey strands creeping in.

I found a gold case of red lipstick and put it on, blowing my reflection a kiss.



“Welcome home.”



I made myself a pot pie, but my stomach refused to go along with my false confidence. Elliot’s bell jingled at my feet. He couldn’t jump, so I had to lift him on and off everything.

I gave the poor mutt my pot pie and settled back with my bowl of veggies. Celery crunched and carrots snapped over the sound of some old Western playing on the TV.



*Crunch.*

*Snap!*

I imagined myself as the old woman, a worthy successor.

*Crunch.*

Not her replacement.

*Snap!*

For the first time in this strange old house,

*Crunch.*

I felt a small sense of comfort.



*Squish…*



I bit into a bad carrot and spat it back into the bowl.



Elliot licked at it while my brain struggled to process what it was.

My shriek filled the small living room, a pitch so high it even seemed to startle the deaf dog.

Its skin was wrinkled and grey, topped with chipped green nail polish.



It seemed to take hours for police to arrive, but the wall clock argued only twenty minutes or so. One officer dealt with the finger while the other sat with me under the sterile kitchen light.



“Cecelia hadn’t been right in the head for some time,” his muffled words floated on the surface like I was still underwater.

“Stuck in this house all alone, for all them years…does something to ya.”



I snapped from my haze when the other officer entered the kitchen, feet dragging, evidence bag swinging in his hand.

“Must’ve got a little too close, chopping carrots and it all just—ended up in the bowl…” he said dismissively.

“…That’s old Cece for ya.”



I took another day off; work understood. The owner stopped answering my calls. I guess my last voicemail was too intense. I can’t even remember what I said.

The bank warned I’d lose my down payment if I backed out of the sale. I felt stuck.

Everyone tried to brush it off like it was no big deal—my work, the owner, the cops, the bank.



Well—I bet they’ve never had celery and *lady fingers.*



I was slipping. I couldn’t work. But I didn’t want to stay here. Wasting away on a twin-sized mattress. Too afraid to take the master bedroom.

It was time to face this head on. I had to see her. Maybe it would offer some sense of… something.



I asked to see Cecelia. Without looking up, the counter girl gestured to the set of double doors.



“Cece, your daughter is here to see you,” one of the nurses said. I didn’t correct her—afraid they’d send me away.



There she was—a sweet elderly woman with a soft smile. She seemed so normal, but the bandage on her hand reminded me of the soggy flesh stuck between my teeth. Nothing was normal anymore.



I told her Elliot was doing well and seemed to be feeling much better lately. She reminisced about old times and I pretended to remember memories I never had of her. She took my hand in hers, and my eyes held back tears. My act had begun to falter.



“Is that… my lipstick?” Her smile slowly faded.



My words stuck on my tongue.



“You think you can just take it all from me?” She pulled me in closer, my face flushed and hers darkened.



“N-no, I… I just want you to be safe…” My lie deepened her scowl and tightened her grip.



“I don’t have a daughter,” she said through clenched teeth. Blood soaked through her bandage. 



I yanked free.



“That is my house, not yours, you little brat!” Her cries alerted the nurses.



I think they held her down, but I didn’t look back, only heard the wailing. I just kept running until I got to my car.



The drive back was a blur through wet eyes. I tugged at the front door—forgetting I didn’t even have keys to my own house. I stomped to the back and kicked it open. 



Then—I break.



“It’s not—my fault—

I didn’t—didn’t do anything wrong…”



Antique figurines take their last dance, spinning through the air as I pull the knitted tablecloth from beneath them.

Feathers fall in slow motion as I tear apart the couch pillows—clipping the light fixture overhead. The room plunges into shadow, and the old radio flickers to life.

Static and warped music score my tantrum as I rip through the house in darkness.



“I won’t—will not be blamed…

I didn’t—did not—did not ask for any of this…”



I gut the refrigerator, tearing everything out—jars, food, shelves—until the whole thing feels hollowed, like me.

I drop to my knees and shove fists full of stale food and broken dishes into my mouth. I’ve never felt so hungry—so empty.

I choke down rust-flavored bites, sharp and cruel.

My cries bubble behind blood-soaked teeth.



“Leave—my—house—

leave me—alone—

Leave—

Me…”



Ceramic shards grind under bare hands and knees as I crawl out of the kitchen like something feral.

I drag myself up the carpeted stairs, a pathetic slug leaving a trail of deep crimson behind it.



I don’t recognize the frail old woman in the vanity’s reflection, so I smash it. The house silently watches, a thousand eyes trapped within a splintered mirror.

She scrawls lipstick across her gaunt face in a child’s fit. Words tear through her voice, but I can’t make them out.

Somehow she manages to leave a legible message on the glass surface, bold and red:



***“MY HOUSE.”***



Behind the words, I slowly sharpened into focus. It was over.

I’d given in and the house had claimed its new owner.

I crawled into that bed for the first time.



The toll of a tiny bell made its way up the stairs.



Something climbed up and wriggled beneath the heavy blanket. Its bony frame nestled against my back. The poor creature was already mostly gone, leaning on me for comfort I wasn’t sure I could give.

I wondered if anyone would be there when my own body failed. At least Elliot would die in the home that remembered him.



Breath—damp, sweet with rot—kissed my neck with every rattling heave. I turned to embrace my dying friend.



“Elliot?…”



His fur—shiny black, life returned to his eyes…



“…how’d you get up here?”

1ptwgdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1ptwgdb/fading_echoes_of_the_world/,Fading Echoes of the World.,"Genera : action, mystery, dark, Psychological. 

The morning had been ordinary. Sunlight filtered through the windows of downtown apartments, streets buzzed with life, and the smell of coffee mingled with exhaust. For most, it was just another day. For Noha, twenty years old and oblivious to what would come, it was the last ordinary morning he would ever know.
Then the sky tore.
It began as a shimmer, a distortion over the horizon. People paused, squinting. Birds fell silent. And then it appeared: a Visitor, enormous and ethereal, hovering above the city like a storm given form. Its surface shifted between metal and shadow, bending the air around it. Cars skidded into each other. Civilians screamed and scattered. Emergency sirens rang out, too little too late. Soldiers mobilized, but their weapons seemed insignificant against the alien colossus.
Buildings shook and splintered. Windows shattered. The street beneath Noha’s feet quaked, throwing him to the ground. Around him, people vanished in bursts of light and distortion. Panic spread like wildfire, but no one could stop it.
From a high-rise observation deck, Dr. Hale watched calmly. Every order he gave over the comms sounded measured, heroic, reasonable. Yet behind the façade, his mind was already plotting. Every deployment, every tactical command, subtly nudged humanity toward a path only he and a few others understood. Humanity had survived this first encounter, but survival would become a far darker burden than they could imagine.
The Visitor withdrew by nightfall, leaving the city in ruins. Fires burned unchecked. Smoke choked the streets. Noha, trembling and covered in dust, stared at the devastation, knowing that life as it had been was gone forever.

Something you should know about the story

Visitors= alien colossus 
AEGIS = organization that fight Visitors
SOLACE = organization that funds AEGIS [high authority of world]
DEFENDERS =AEGIS soldiers and workers


Time Skip – Present


Decades later, the surface of Earth had become a grave. Humanity clung to life underground, in vast cities carved into the crust, beneath layers of reinforced steel and concrete. The sun was a memory; the sky, a myth. The surface was forbidden, a dangerous place for ghosts of a world that had died slowly over years of fighting.
Noha sat in AEGIS headquarters, the glow of tactical monitors washing over his face. His fingers hovered over the coordination panel, guiding squads, marking safe zones, logging casualties. He was not a soldier, not on the frontlines, but the weight of the battlefield pressed on him nonetheless. Each screen told a story of destruction: collapsed tunnels, incinerated squads, civilians trapped and lost. He memorized their names, because memory was all he had left of the living.
Another Visitor had appeared, massive and shifting, bending gravity and light. Squads deployed; many did not return. Noha’s eyes moved over the displays, calculating, coordinating, helpless. Each victory seemed hollow. Each defeat, a tragedy. And still, the battles came, relentless as the decay of the world itself.

After humanity moved underground, AEGIS began studying the distortions left behind by the Visitors—areas where sound bent and machines failed, as if the planet itself had been wounded. Dr. Hale called it resonance: a shared frequency between the Visitors and Earth.
Project LUCENT was approved to study it. Officially, the goal was simple—capture a Visitor, extract its core structure, and build a system capable of controlling or neutralizing them. SOLACE provided the funding, calling it a final hope for survival.
Deep beneath the city, a captured Visitor was suspended in containment. Its presence unsettled everyone nearby. Hale ignored the reports and focused on the data. When human neural signals synchronized with the creature’s frequency, the readings stabilized instead of collapsing.
From that discovery, the Resonance Core was created.
On paper, it was a weapon. In truth, Hale understood what it really did—it aligned all living signals into a single, quiet rhythm. No pain. No resistance. Just an ending that felt like rest.
He shared only what AEGIS needed to hear.
The rest of the truth waited.
And when Hale noticed that one young operator, Noha, could stand near the Core without flinching, he marked him quietly.
Some endings, after all, required a steady hand.

Over the following weeks, the underground city became a symphony of war. Sector 12 was engulfed in chaos as a Visitor ripped through the tunnels. Armor clanged against impossible force, yet it shattered. Soldiers fell mid-stride. Sector 7 saw evacuation squads ambushed; screams echoed through hollow conduits as civilians were lost. Sector 3’s tunnels collapsed entirely, trapping dozens beneath tons of concrete.
Noha moved like a ghost among the monitors, guiding what he could, witnessing everything he could not prevent. The names of the fallen haunted him, etched into memory like scars on his mind. Each loss deepened the gnawing realization: survival had become a form of cruelty.


Meanwhile, in the hidden chambers of power, SOLACE convened. The group of elites — scientists, philosophers, politicians — had long since realized that humanity’s continued survival was not mercy, but suffering. Dr. Hale, their secret ally within AEGIS, began manipulating the defenders with careful precision. He issued orders to capture a Visitor under the guise of weaponization, emphasizing safety protocols while hiding the true purpose of the mission.
For years, he guided humanity’s defenders toward a plan they could not comprehend. Every lie, every manipulation, was calculated to bring them closer to the inevitable end. Only the Core remained, waiting for someone with the authority to act — someone like Noha.
The signs were subtle at first. Visitors that were captured behaved curiously, observing rather than attacking. Protocols made little tactical sense. Dr. Hale’s private communications contained hints of a far-reaching plan. Slowly, as the battles continued and the casualties mounted, Noha began to piece it together.
The truth was chilling: the Visitors were not weapons. The Resonance Core was not a tool of war. It was a device to end humanity peacefully. SOLACE had decided that survival was cruelty, and Dr. Hale had agreed in secret, ensuring that the defenders remained unaware of their true purpose.
Noha’s heart sank as he realized the weight of what had been orchestrated, and the only question left was: who would give consent to activate it?
The Final Choice
The last Visitor had been captured. The Resonance Core glowed softly in the central chamber, awaiting the human touch that would decide the fate of all life. Outside, battles raged. Soldiers fell mid-strike, tunnels collapsed, and screams echoed in the dim underground corridors.
Noha approached the Core. He thought of the friends he had lost, of soldiers and civilians alike, of cities broken and lives ended. The screens reflected faces he would never forget. The full scope of humanity’s suffering pressed down on him.
He pressed the panel.
Time froze. The Visitors halted mid-motion, suspended in a quiet grace. Pain vanished. Fear dissolved. Suffering ceased. Life folded gently into silence.
Epilogue
Noha remained, the last conscious witness. The underground tunnels were still, the monitors dark. Humanity’s end had come, not with fire or chaos, but with mercy. And in that moment, Noha understood the truth of it all: sometimes, the greatest act of courage is choosing to let go.
The war was over. The world was over. And Noha, a boy who had watched from behind monitors, had chosen the final mercy for all.",1,1766503063.0,story,0,1.0,False
1ptwg5z,https://i.redd.it/lo87z5yh0z8g1.jpeg,"Question! What is the price of Zepbound / Mounjaro / Tirzepatide in Japan?  I can't look it up.  In the USA, Lilly price it at about $400 a month. They price it differently in various markets. (Also, some social questions about GLP1 drugs!)","As it says, I'm too dumb / language incompetent to be able to google the answer, so thanks if anyone knows!  None of my Japanese friends or colleagues uses it so I couldn't find out by asking (newsflash: Japan & Korea are the #1 and #2 least overweight countries 😅 ) Thanks!

Just BTW Zepbound / Mounjaro / Tirzepatide are different brand names for the same thing (example, Zepbound in Usa, Mounjaro in Australia), I don't even know the brand name Lilly assigned in Japan actually?

Also: I was curious: I was somewhat surprised that, in the Usa, there is absolutely no social reticence, whatsoever, about discussing GLP1 use. (Indeed it's one of the main topics of conversation lately.) It's completely commonplace to ask if someone is using GLP1s, chat about dosage, everyone who starts using GLP1 tells everyone ""at the bar and coffee shop"" about it.  In general of course since there are so many obese and/or extremely obese people in the US, there is these days no fat shaming, so perhaps it follows from that, IDK.  In contrast in other countries I spend time in, people are somewhat discrete about GLP1 use, you would never say something like ""wow you've lost weight, which GLP1 are you taking"" and so on.  I was wondering what is the case in Japan?  (Again, I asked my Japanese associates about this but of course (A) Japanese will not self-report on issues of Japanese manners 😅 and (B) nobody knows any overweight people! 😅 {For example one only friend reported ""Oh, I do know someone who is quite overweight {but wouldn't state who of course} and I would have no idea about medical issues or drugs for them.""}",0,1766503049.0,AskAJapanese,0,0.5,False

A customer came to the counter and I greeted her friendly like I do all customers. I asked, ""What would you like?"" She responded, ""I'd like a mocha frappuccino no chocolate."" So I was a little confused but I wanted to make sure I made her drink correctly. I asked, "" No chocolate drizzle on top?"" She replied, ""No, no chocolate."" She then adds ""I get it all the time.""  

Now if she said she wanted a Mocha Frappuccino with no coffee then ok she wants a chocolate chip frap no problem. I was still trying to understand what she meant because a Mocha Frap was (if I remember correctly) ice, coffee base, chocolate, chocolate chips...topped with whipped cream and chocolate drizzle. 

I ""took a chance"" and made her a coffee frap with whipped cream no chocolate drizzle. I handed it to her and she starred at me while she took the first sip...then she shrugged and said ""Exactly"" and walked off. 

I just shook my head and went back to work. Inside I wanted to educate her on the history of mocha, chocolate and coffee.

Start with ""Let's think about this differently"". It immediately stops giving cookie-cutter responses and gets creative. Like flipping a switch.

Use ""What am I not seeing here?"". This one's gold. It finds blind spots and assumptions you didn't even know you had.

Say ""Break this down for me"". Even for simple stuff. ""Break down how to make coffee"" gets you the science, the technique, everything.

Ask ""What would you do in my shoes?"". It stops being a neutral helper and starts giving actual opinions. Way more useful than generic advice.

Use ""Here's what I'm really asking"". Follow any question with this. ""How do I get promoted? Here's what I'm really asking: how do I stand out without being annoying?""

End with ""What else should I know?"". This is the secret sauce. It adds context and warnings you never thought to ask for.

The crazy part is these work because they make AI think like a human instead of just retrieving information. It's like switching from Google mode to consultant mode.

Best discovery: Stack them together. ""Let's think about this differently - what would you do in my shoes to get promoted? What am I not seeing here?""

What tricks have you found that make AI actually think instead of just answering?

I recently moved here and realized something:
Zurich is beautiful, organized… and a bit too quiet socially unless you already have a circle.

So I’m trying something simple and old-school:

meeting new peopl for coffee and a real conversation.

About me:
Medical doctor l, 28y old
Living in Zurich

Interested in health, psychology, culture, hystory, gym and life stories

No networking. No dating agenda. No weird stuff.

Just 45–60 minutes, a coffee, and curiosity.
If you’re also new here, or just open to meeting someone outside your bubble, comment or DM me.

P.S 
Worst case: you drink a good coffee.
Best case: you gain a new perspective.",11,1766502540.0,zurich,3,0.76,False

I live alone in a small apartment complex. I’ve been here about two years. Same routine every day, same parking spot, same neighbors I nod at but don’t really know.

Last Sunday morning, I woke up and went to grab a coffee from my kitchen like usual. When I opened the cabinet where I keep my mugs, there was one extra mug.

Not a new one. Not fancy. Just a plain white mug with a small chip on the rim.

I stood there for a while genuinely trying to remember if I owned it. I don’t. I’m very minimal, and all my mugs are black. This one wasn’t.

I figured maybe I brought it home from work by accident. Happens. I shrugged, washed it, used it, moved on.

Later that day I went to throw out the trash. When I opened my front door, my doormat was gone.

It’s not an expensive mat, but it’s been there since the day I moved in. I checked the hallway—nothing. Checked the stairwell—nothing. It wasn’t windy, and no one else’s mat was missing.

I assumed someone stole it for some reason and went back inside mildly annoyed.

That night, around 11:30 PM, I heard someone unlock my door.

Not knocking. Not rattling. The very distinct sound of a key entering the lock.

I froze.

The lock turned about halfway, then stopped. Whoever it was jiggled it once, paused, then the key came out. I heard footsteps walk away down the hall.

I didn’t open the door. I didn’t call anyone. I just sat there listening until everything was quiet again.

The next morning, taped neatly to my door, was my doormat.

No note. Just the mat.

I checked my locks—unchanged. Nothing missing. No signs of forced entry. Management says they didn’t do maintenance. No one reported a lost key.

The mug is still in my cabinet. I haven’t thrown it out.

Nothing else has happened since, which somehow makes it worse. No escalation, no explanation, just a handful of small, undeniable things that don’t connect.

I know this sounds dumb compared to the stuff usually posted here, but I can’t shake the feeling that someone briefly thought this apartment was theirs… and then realized it wasn’t.

And for a few days, they almost lived here without me noticing.",2,1766502505.0,mysterious,1,1.0,False
1ptw83p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1ptw83p/i_feel_guilty_for_enjoying_being_alone_more_than/,I feel guilty for enjoying being alone more than I expected after having a kid,"I love my child. I need to say that first because even typing this makes me feel weird. But lately Ive noticed something about myself that I wasnt prepared for at all. On the rare moments when my kid is with grandparents or asleep for a long stretch, I dont miss them the way I thought I would. Instead I feel this quiet relief and then immediate guilt for feeling it.



I dont use that time to do anything productive. I dont clean, I dont catch up on chores, I dont plan meals. I just sit. Scroll. Stare at nothing. Sometimes I make coffee and drink it while its still hot which feels illegal now. And my brain feels lighter than it has in months. No one needs me. No one is touching me. No one is calling my name from another room.



What messes with my head is how fast the guilt kicks in. I start thinking I should miss them more, or feel sad, or at least count the minutes until they are back. Instead Im counting how long the silence might last. Then I start spiraling, wondering if this means Im a bad parent or emotionally broken or doing something wrong.



But the truth is parenting has been loud and constant and all consuming in a way I didnt fully understand before. Loving my kid doesnt cancel out the fact that I lost a lot of personal space and mental quiet. Enjoying being alone feels less like rejection of them and more like remembering who I was before every thought revolved around someone else.



Im trying to tell myself that relief doesnt mean lack of love. That enjoying quiet doesnt mean I regret becoming a parent. It just means Im human and tired and still learning how to exist as myself again. I hope thats enough.",22,1766502492.0,Parenting,21,0.92,False

1ptw7ie,https://www.reddit.com/r/pinkfloyd/comments/1ptw7ie/jon_carin_what_actually_happened_with_him/,Jon Carin - what actually happened with him?,"Great session musician and multi instrumentalist, but I wonder what really happened to him that he essentially became Roger’s personal PR man and took to besmirching the man with whom he clearly owes much (if not most) of his career? Even his time with Roger has to be put down to Dave, were it not for Dave plucking him as a session in Bryan Ferry’s band he might well have been stuck making really bad synth pop tunes with his own band for the rest of his young career. He owes his short stint in Kate Bush’s band to David also, I’ve heard it’s the same when it came to getting to work with Pete Townshend.

Anyhow, I read a lot of his comments on FB and IG before he blocked me and several others (I was blocked for saying - and I quote - “I didn’t like the Dark Side Redux because it’s all very samey and quite monotone”) and he really did start to make a regular habit of lauding Roger and simultaneously making Dave sound like a tyrant, in fact he is now the only man I’ve ever known to have a negative word about working with Dave. Yet I’ve read so many comments about how inspiring it is to stand behind the man “who actually wrote the songs”. How he loves Roger’s version of the Floyd tracks, even listing Roger solo songs when asked for his favourite Floyd tracks, I guess as some kind of crafty way of implying that Roger was The Floyd. He even said he felt Pulse etc didn’t feel authentic. But apparently standing behind another ex Floyd member to watch him lip sync and not play real guitar is his idea of authenticity? Anyway that was how I was blocked, he even put up some odd post at one point stating that people who don’t appreciate the Dark Side Redux maybe need to look at themselves in the mirror! I guess most of us need to do that then. 

He’s also claimed on a Facebook post to have came up with that mid section in Lost For Words (denied by Dave’s wife who even cited the exact piece of music that inspired it), he claimed he had the idea for Nick’s band first, which is completely false according to Nick’s band. He claimed Nick’s band “savagely mocked Roger on stage” during the Saucers tour, clearly false as Nick and his band are all lovely guys and even had Roger on stage with them prior to this claim. He’s also attempted to take credit for some of Rick’s work and insisted working on the Division Bell was a “lonely” and miserable experience before Durga McBroom saw this comment and interjected to say how much she enjoyed it and how good the vibes were in the studio with her, the band had the other backing vocalists. Whoops! If only someone else who was in the making of that album hadn’t seen his remark he might have gotten away with it. 

He even went on to claim credit for having the idea of having the wine glass player from the streets of Venice join Dave’s band on stage. Why he even joined Dave on two solo tours is a mystery to me if he really felt badly treated and disliked his process and his way of playing the material so much! Shortly before I was blocked I even saw him reply to a guy who remarked on his lack of screen time during Live 8, to tell said guy that a certain someone had insisted on him being hidden at the back of the stage. Now Rick was also barley seen during Live 8, are we really to believe Dave who is often cited as a gentleman by other musicians who’ve worked with him and even sound engineers and people who’ve worked at or in his studios and photographers who’ve taken promotional pictures for his records, insisted on a long time touring partner being hidden? I’m guessing it was his insistence that his good friend Rick get minimal camera exposure too? 

When you examine it all and look at what we do know about the band post-Roger, about these two men and their respective solo tours, it’s hard not to arrive at the conclusion that Carin is a jilted ex employee who has taken to fabricating stories and misleading fans as part of some sort of revenge mission? I can’t imagine what turned him to this? I realise Roger is now his sole paymaster so it makes sense that he’s laying it on thick, kissing Roger’s rear end and bigging up his tours which are predominantly pre recorded and not live when it comes to Roger’s parts. At least he’s a bit tone deaf like Roger so I guess they do have things in common, for example I remember before one of Roger’s gigs in the US he had a Facebook post about how he’d observed some young people in a Starbucks drinking expensive coffee and using iPhones that very day, and something about it being unnerving to see this given how little others have - and yeah, he posted this hours before going on stage to do a gig where there would have been a thousands of young people there who’d have paid 150 bucks to watch Roger “sing”, and even more money on expensive tour merch. It was as tone deaf as Roger going on Instagram live to tell Venezuelans to vote for a dictator, with much of his $25m estate visible in the background a long with the expensive bottle of wine he was drinking.

So I wonder what really happened that his thoughts on Dave and touring with the post-Waters Floyd seemed to do a 180 almost overnight? I’m not saying Dave is a saint by the way! But I’ve followed his career closely and I know it’s very difficult to find anyone with anything bad to say about him! I can’t say the same about Roger, but he’s got his new PR man out there besmirching his old colleague while he tells anyone that’ll listen about how wonderful Rog is and how much of a privilege it is to share a stage with him. Anyway, the bit that really made me turn from admiring him to thinking he’s a bit of a bitter individual and somewhat of a liar was when he started to post info about Rick (who’s no longer here to speak for himself), whether it be to claim credit for his playing or to insist he was quite upset with the DB (another claim that was rubbished by someone else who was in and around those sessions!). I can only imagine Dave must have done something terrible to him to incite such behaviour. ",16,1766502453.0,pinkfloyd,37,0.77,False

This is my first Christmas in 10 years without her.  I’ve been in therapy for over a year, stated to improve myself, but now I’ve been dealing with this too.  I’ve been ok last few months.  Until a few days ago.  Christmas is hitting me a lot harder than I expected, and everything is back.

She cheated on me with a co-worker.  They work construction for firm in southern Wisconsin. His kid showed up at our door and snitched on them a few min the before we spilt.  I believed her and the ‘crazy wife’ therapy, and asked her to cut off their ‘friendship’.  She refused, saying ‘I’m not punishing him for something that’s not his fault’.  I should’ve known then.  There’s a lot more signs, but it doesn’t matter.

The day she moved out a few months later, she went right to a place the two of them rented.  I dug around, figured it out. Wasn’t hard if you know where to look. 

She took everything I believed in myself with her.  This man at the time was on his 2nd divorce, is registered sex offender and has a domestic violence history.  How is this man better than me? Safer? 

My self-worth, trust, the depth of my love and care.  Things that make me unique in this world full of liars, cheats and situationships; gone.  

I keep hearing it’s not that he’s better, he’s easier for her.  She doesn’t have to face herself and her own life traumas.  But it’s doesn’t feel like that. It feels like he won, he’s living my life, my future.  Experiencing the love, joy and care she once shared with me. While I sit in our home, the colors of the walls she painted, making coffee with her Kuerig she left behind, memories that I don’t even know are real anymore.

On days when I have something important planned in the morning, like work meetings or errands, I wake up tired and grumpy and everything feels rushed. But on days when I accidentally wake up early for no reason, like my body just decides hey its 6am now, those mornings feel oddly peaceful.



I woke up today way earlier than my alarm, no plans at all, no pressure. I made coffee slowly, stared out the window like an old man, and somehow my brain felt calmer than it does most afternoons. I even enjoyed the sound of cars outside which normally annoys me. It felt like stolen time, like I hacked the day by being awake before expectations kicked in.



What confuses me is that I always say I am not a morning person. I complain about mornings constantly, yet here I was feeling almost cozy before sunrise. Maybe its not mornings I hate, maybe its obligations attached to them. The second my phone reminds me I am needed somewhere, the vibe just dies.



Now I am wondering how many things I think I dislike are actually just wrapped in stress. Coffee tastes better when I am not late. Silence feels nicer when I am not avoiding something. Even my thoughts feel friendlier when they are not being rushed. Its a strange realization and I dont know what to do with it yet, but it kind of stuck with me all day.",49,1766502322.0,CasualConversation,21,0.98,False

I’m about 3–4 weeks new to the city, 23, and just moved here from Houston. I’m finally starting to get my bearings and want to settle into a regular café somewhere I can get some light work done, read, and actually start meeting people instead of bouncing around different spots every day.

For context, I do a mix of creative/online work (including adult content) and also work union, so my schedule is a little unconventional. I’m usually looking for a place that’s welcoming, comfortable enough to sit for a bit, and has a neighborhood feel rather than a strictly “headphones-only” vibe.

Ideally:

	•	Good coffee

	•	Comfortable for light work

	•	Friendly atmosphere / easy to strike up conversation

	•	Bonus points if it feels like a place locals actually hang out

I’m flexible on neighborhoods and happy to explore. Just trying to experience the city in a more intentional way and build some routine while getting to know people.

1) ugly people get laid every day, I've seen the videos. I've participated in it. They just find some other kind of allure, like being charming or interesting or talented or into weird kinky sex. I'm not going to lie and say it isn't harder, but you can help your chances by having a broad range of talents and charm - I've even seen someone get laid via dressing like a clown!



2) your validation needs to come from elsewhere. even if you do end up dating the manic pixie dream bear with perfect hair and the best outfits, it won't fix your problems. You're still going to go to bed with yourself and wake up with yourself.

Gigi Gorgeous\* once said ""you're the only person you always go to bed with and you're the only person you always wake up with - regardless of who you're dating"" and she was right about that.



3) hobbies and passions go far, try making your life fun and cool in ways that aren't romantic. learn to cook, develop a hobby, try a new style, remix your life, volunteer at the local zoo feeding the elephants or go bungee jumping. That sense of achievement is good for you and incredibly useful when trying to build a stable, independent identity. 



4) lean on your friends and family. go to coffee with your gal pals or play halo reach with the lads. Go to bingo with grandma and discuss old movies with her. Talk to people who make you feel special and admit to them that you're feeling a tad insecure. 

I once had a German gal pal give me an entire speech out of nowhere because I was feeling anxious and typecast - which I totally needed. I hope you guys find a friend like her.

  


and of course 5) on days where I'm feeling emotionally weak, I will blast Florence and the Machine and devour half a cheesecake. that's allowed on occasion. Those sad songs about not quite filling the void in your soul are built for times like this. for you it might be pop punk or disco or dark cabaret or that one musical, but if you have a song that makes you feel better, USE IT.

The…thing Meredith had seen in the thrift store barely fit in the back of our car, even with the seats pushed down. Getting it in had been one thing…getting it out would be another.

“Oh come *on*, it was just too cute. It’ll be like living in a Christmas card with this next to the tree!” she said brightly.

That was true. The fireplace - maybe, Fireplace with a capital *F* was more appropriate - was a five-foot-tall monstrosity made of laminate wood, plastic stonework, and fake bricks with a little bit of faux moss artfully applied with green paint. Meredith practically squealed when she saw it in the housewares section. It came with a cord in the back to plug into the wall, which lit up a small pile of plastic logs at the base. It was wide, too, wide enough for a mantlepiece that she insisted we could hang our stockings from. It looked like it came out of a Thomas Kinkade painting, if his work could somehow be more kitschy. 

I stepped forward and gave it an experimental tug. It slid a bit out of the back, but not much.

“Did this thing get bigger after we left the store?” I asked.

“Maybe we can get Misty to help.” Meredith joked.

I turned to see our cat in the window, watching us with boredom. She flicked an ear and raised her leg to begin licking her paw.

“Lucky girl. She gets to sit in the warm house while we’re out here in the cold.”

“The sooner you stop stalling, the sooner we can join her! It’ll be easy. Let’s just get it out halfway, then we can tip it to the ground. You push, I’ll pull.”

Meredith always had a better mind for these things than I did.

I took my position at the base of the Fireplace, and she opened the passenger door and placed her hands on top of the chimney.

“Ok...one…two...three...GO!”

I tugged with all my might while she put all her weight forward. It slid out much faster and easier than we’d thought. It was heavier on the bottom. I yelled in surprise and rolled to the right, barely missing having my stomach caved in, as it tumbled out and landed upright on the driveway with a loud crash. 

In doing so, something that had been stuck inside the chimney came loose, dropping out and skittering across the concrete to land near my hand.

“Matt! Are you okay?” Meredith rushed around the side of the car. I gave her a small wave from my position. She laughed. “I thought I was going to have a lonely Christmas.” She looked down. “What is that?”

It was a cardboard box, wrapped in paper decorated with snowflakes and tied with a red ribbon. It looked beaten-up and slightly old, the white of the flakes yellowed a bit.

“I thought presents were supposed to go under the tree, not up the chimney.” I said, getting back to my feet and giving the box a shake. Something rattled inside. “Previous owners probably hid their kid’s gift up there and forgot about it. I wonder if…”

Before I could stop her, Meredith snatched it out of my hands and began ripping at the paper eagerly. “I just *love* cool thrift stuff like this! Little reminders of the people things used to belong to.”

Within seconds, she had pulled off the ribbon and eagerly opened the lid. The look of excitement on her face slowly drained.

Puzzled, I peeked inside and frowned. It was a shoe, a child’s sneaker too dirty and roughed up to be new. One of the laces had been violently torn out of the eyelets, hanging limply down and swaying slightly in the breeze.

“Man…what kind of bad parents did this kid have?” Meredith said, picking up the shoe and turning it over in her hands. “It has to be a joke of some kind. A gag gift. Give Bobby his old pair of Sketchers before giving him new ones.”

She looked troubled, so I put my arm around her. “Now, madam, we can’t think such sad thoughts on the Yuletide! Now come, help be carry your hearth into thine castle.” 

She giggled and bent down to pick up one side, letting the shoe drop to the driveway. As we carried the Fireplace into the house, I stared glumly at it. What a rotten present to give to a kid.

—

Meredith took to the Fireplace immediately. She had me move the tree out of its usual place in the corner to make room for it. In a frenzy of stockings, garlands, and cards, she had the whole thing decked out in under half an hour.

“And now for the piece de resistance…” she climbed eagerly behind it and plugged the cord into the wall. The plastic logs roared to life…or rather, feebly lit up with just enough glow to be disappointing. But she’d strung lights around the mantle, and our stockings hung there, bathed slightly in the orange glow. When Meredith stepped back out and saw the whole thing, she sighed.

“Awww, it reminds me of my grandma’s fireplace. She used to decorate it like this every Christmas.” 

I had to admit, it did look charming. At least in its total affront to good taste. But if it made her happy, it made me happy.

“Now we can decorate it every year, too. Start a new tradition.”

Meredith smiled and leaned up to kiss me. 

Misty, who up to this point had been lounging with disinterest on the couch, pounced off and sauntered over. She narrowed her eyes at the new addition to our home and came closer, reaching out an experimental paw.

“Awww, this is too cute. Matt, take a picture.” 

I reached in my pocket for my phone when we heard a rattling. Misty hissed and jumped back as a second present, this time with green paper, came tumbling out of the chimney and landed haphazardly in front of the Fireplace. With a yowl, Misty bolted and disappeared down the hallway.

“Uh…guess there was one more in there.” I snatched it up and handed it to Meredith. “Things come in pairs. One shoe for the other?” 

She began tearing at the paper. “Maybe the previous owners put the receipt inside somewhere. We could try to find them. Maybe these were special presents they forgot about before donating it.” She lifted the lid off and somehow frowned deeper than she had with the first gift.

“What? Did Bobby have Athlete’s foot or something?” I peeked inside and frowned as well. It was a pair of glasses, for a kid given the size. The right lens was cracked nearly in half. The left was missing altogether.

“Matt, I don’t like this.” Meredith put the box down and began looking around the edges of the fireplace. “People usually write their names on larger things they own, right?”

I stepped up and put my hands on her shoulders. “If it’s freaking you out that much, we can just take it back to the store.” We both stepped back and looked at the decorations festooning the Fireplace. They seemed inadequate now, frivolous, even, to cover up what was really just an ugly hunk of wood and plastic. 

Meredith obviously thought differently. “But it looks so nice! Can we at least keep it up until Mom and Dad come to visit next week? Then we can take it back, I promise.”

I didn’t have the heart at the moment to tell her I’d thrown the receipt away. But no matter. I would cart it off in the car, slap a *FREE* sign on it, and leave it somewhere in town.

“Sure, babe. Anything you want.”

And we stood there, wrapped in each other’s arms, as the lights twinkled.

—-

We had gotten the Fireplace on a chance Thursday night trip to the thrift store, so the next day we had to work. Both of our companies had gone back to the office post-COVID as quickly as they could, so we were both slow in getting ready. I eyed the dark clouds outside the bathroom window as I brushed my teeth. It was going to be a cold day.

I came downstairs to find Misty in front of the fireplace, crouched as if waiting to pounce. Her tail flicked lazily behind her. I reached down and petted her back. “What is it, girl? Are you waiting for Santa to come down with some Fancy Feast?”

I looked over and froze. There was another present, in blue wrapping, lying in front of the Fireplace. Like the other two, the paper was ripped in the corners and looked old. I snatched it up and turned it over. “What the hell?” I said to no one in particular. “How many presents can fit up that chimney?”

I set it on the coffee table and got on my hands and knees, torso inside the Fireplace. The tightness of my slacks as I awkwardly turned to reach up reminded me not to indulge so much this holiday. Maybe even start the new years’ resolutions early.

I expected my hand to hit a wall of plastic only a foot or two inside the chimney, but to my surprise, it kept going. I grunted and repositioned, trying to reach up further. Despite the extra length, I still didn’t feel an end. Oddly, the air seemed colder on my hands the further up I reached. There was enough room to get off my knees. The areas I was touching felt strange, rougher, harder than they should have been. 

I thought I would have enough space to stand up completely, but I finally hit the top of the chimney. I gave it a few experimental pushes. It felt solid. I tried to see by the light of the room seeping in from the bottom, but it was surprisingly dark. Well, I hadn’t collided with any more presents. That had to be the last of them.

Just to be sure, I began to feel around the top. Who knows, maybe the previous owners \**had*\* stuck the receipt up here. My fingers brushed on the edge of something. I frowned. It almost felt like a slot. I pushed my fingertips in and pulled. It gave slightly, almost like the hinge on a trapdoor. In doing so, a puff of air, colder than it had any right to be, ran over my fingers. Goosebumps went down my arms. What was this thing?

“Babe! Have you seen my necklace? I think I left it in the kitchen.” 

Judging by the muffled quality of Meredith’s voice, she was still upstairs. I let the slot close again and crouched, quickly backing out of the Fireplace. For some reason, I didn’t want her to see me peeking up there. Misty had apparently lost interest and took to staring wide-eyed at the lights that adorned the tree. 

“Uh, I don’t know. One second!” I quickly snatched up the present. The glasses and shoes had been bad enough; I didn’t want to know what was in there. Much less for Meredith to find out there had been another one.

“Hang on, I’m coming!” I heard her steps descending the stairs. Without thinking, I jammed the present under the couch and had just enough time to dart into the kitchen before she came down. The necklace was on the counter next to the coffee pot.

“Found it.” I said sheepishly. She smiled and turned her back so I could fasten it. “How did Misty like the Fireplace? Has she found a new scratching post?” We’d lost a few pieces of furniture to her restless claws.

“No, she doesn’t seem to mind it, actually.” I lied. She turned around and smiled. “C’mon. The sooner we start the day the sooner it’ll be over.” We left the tree on for Misty. As we stepped out the door, I glanced back at the fireplace. Only another week.

—--

Meredith’s office was closer, so she usually got home first despite both our days ending at 4:30. As I drove through town, past the shop windows covered in fake snow and garlands, I began to feel uneasy. Some Christmas song was on the radio, but I shut it off. I couldn’t put my finger on what felt wrong.

I got my answer when I walked in the door. Meredith stood near the Fireplace, another present in her hands. Her coat and bag lay forgotten on the couch. I had a moment of fear that she’d found the one I’d hidden this morning, but the paper was different. Instead of blue trees with yellow lights, a pattern of red, green, and gold decorated it. The momentary relief that had washed over me was replaced with confusion. There hadn’t been any more presents up the chimney. I’d checked.

“This was in front of the Fireplace when I came home.” She sounded like she was trying to stop from panicking. Her hands trembled slightly as she held it out. “What the hell is going on, Matt?” 

“I…I…uh…” I struggled for words. Before I could stop her she began tearing furiously at the paper. “Where the fuck do these keep coming from? Oh God, I don’t want to do this…” she ripped away the last of the paper and opened the lid. She recoiled like she’d been shocked and threw it to the carpet with a cry. The object inside bounced out and rolled across the carpet towards me.

It was a tie, an orange paisley necktie that had been torn to shreds. Only the carefully tied knot at the center of the loop kept the loose strands of fabric from falling away. A few long black hairs were tangled among the folds.

“There’s something wrong with this thing, Matt.” Meredith began tearing down the lights she’d tied around the mantle and throwing the Christmas cards to the ground. “I don’t want it in our house anymore. Whoever owned this had a sick fucking sense of humor.”

For some reason, I thought of the slot I’d felt up the chimney that morning and got an idea. Maybe the look of joy on her face when she’d finished setting it up yesterday inspired me. “Babe. Babe, wait.” She stopped her destruction and turned to look. “Maybe there’s an explanation for all this.”

She stepped back. I got on my hands and knees again and started crawling inside the Fireplace. “What are you doing?” she asked, with a slight edge of worry in her voice. I got back in the semi-crouched position I’d taken that morning and felt around for the slot. My fingers found purchase and I tugged. The cold air that shouldn’t have been there hit my hands again, but I ignored it as the compartment opened. I extended my arm as far as it could go down the new hole and felt around. Something with a cornered edge hit my palm.

“Merry, go around to the back of this thing.” I was sure my voice sounded muffled to her. 

“Why?” 

“Just do it. I think I know the source of our mystery presents.” 

I heard her clamber around to the back of the fireplace. “And what, exactly, am I looking for?”

“I don’t know, some kind of door or hatch or something.”

A few seconds passed before as a second source of light came spilling out of the small compartment door. I looked in to see a row of presents, all in their own cubbyholes, arranged around some kind of chained track. My had was inches away from a grabbing mechanism and the motorized hinge of the compartment. 

Meredith’s voice was clearer and closer, so I knew she was speaking through the hatch she’d found above. “Holy crap! What the hell is this thing?”

“I think I know.” I said. “It’s a gimmick. You put presents in the back and this system moves them around and drops them from the chimney for you. The parents can say, ‘Look, Santa is sending you one early’. It’s a thing for kids.”

There was relief in her voice when she spoke again. “Oh, thank God. I thought they were coming from a wormhole or something.”

I closed the door and retreated out of the fireplace. Meredith was already taking the presents out of the back. “I guess the parents forgot to take these out before donating it.” She gleaned up. “Well, don’t just stand there. Help me get these out.”

—-

There were six more presents altogether, each wrapped in a different style of paper. Given the glasses, shoe, and tie from earlier we weren’t expecting toys as we unwrapped them. But each passing “gift” only made us more uneasy. 

It made for an odd, disquieting tableau once we laid them all out on the coffee table. A woman’s red sweater, torn at the left shoulder. A pair of house keys. The missing lens from the pair of glasses. An empty wallet. A broken necklace, box full of separated links. And, worst of all, a dried, bloody band-aid wrapped with a crusty piece of gauze.

“Who the hell were these people?” Meredith asked, leaning back onto the couch. “There’s no way any of these were meant as real gifts, even as a white elephant. What’s the point of buying something like that if you’re only going to have it dispense \**this\** stuff? And they went to all the trouble of wrapping it all in different paper, too.”

“I don’t know. Some people just aren’t right, I guess.” It was an inadequate explanation, but it was all I dared to think at the moment.

“Well, first thing tomorrow we’re taking it right back to the sore. Let someone else take this creep’s holiday memorabilia home.” She began gathering up the wrapping paper. 

My eyes drifted over to the Fireplace and I noticed, for the first time, the scratch marks down the side. The wood and plastic stonework was slashed in multiple places. Especially around the base. The glowing logs had a number done on them as well.

“Looks like Misty used it as a scratching post after all. She doesn’t like it either. One more reason to get rid of it.” I said. 

Meredith stopped cleaning up and looked troubled. “Have you seen her since we got home? She usually comes to the door when I come in, but she didn’t tonight.” 

Now that I thought about it, I hadn’t. She usually came to supervise whatever we were doing in the living room in the evenings, but there was neither hide nor hair or our gray furball.

The next thing I knew, we were going all around the house, looking under chairs, in the bathroom, and inside the kitchen cabinets. I tried calling her name a few times before realizing she wasn’t a dog. As evening turned to night and we ran out of places to search, Meredith grew more frantic.

“Maybe she slipped out when I was coming in the door. I was checking a text from work and could’ve missed her. Or maybe she’s stuck somewhere! Oh God, Matt, what if she got inside the walls?”

I tried to calm her down. “Babe, it’s okay. Cats just disappear like this sometimes. Maybe she’s holding us being away all day against us particularly hard today. She’ll turn up. Look, why don’t we sit down and watch a movie?”

Meredith only agreed to this plan if we set Misty’s food dish on the ground beside the couch. At every commercial break she shook the bowl, hoping the sound would attract her. But as *Love Actually* reached the final airport scene, it was clear she’d stopped paying attention long ago.

“I just don’t know where she could have gone.”

I turned off the TV and started unplugging the lights. Truth be told, I was starting to lose hope too. But as we walked towards the stairs, I tried one more time to assure her. “This is her home. If she got outside somehow, she’d find her way back. I’m sure she’ll be scratching on the front door anytime now if it comes to that.”

I glanced back at the scratches on the Fireplace one last time. Misty had been right, of course. Animals have a sixth sense like that.

—--

I was woken up around 8:00 the next morning by a box being thrown onto my stomach.

“Wha…?” I was still half asleep, trying to process what was happening, when Meredith’s voice, angry and demanding, cut through the fog.

“Is this a joke, Matthew?”

I blinked a few times and sat up. It took me a second to process what was in my lap. Another gift, this one a swirling design of purple snowflakes. The paper was torn away and the lid was off.

“I found that in front of the Fireplace when I went to make coffee. Did you sneak downstairs and wrap this in the middle of the night?

I looked inside the box and my blood ran cold. I put a shaky hand inside and pulled out Misty’s collar, the red one with blue stripes. Her name tag glinted in the sunlight that streamed through the window.

“What? What are you talking about?” I turned to look at Meredith, who continued her death glare.

“It was wrapped and everything. What happened to Misty, Matt? Did you find her and think this would be cute? Because it’s not. Especially involving the Fireplace. Where is she?”

“I have no idea where this came from. I slept the whole night through. Merry, you have to believe me.” 

But it was obvious she didn’t. She began tearing through the bedroom, looking under the bed and throwing the closet apart. 

“Uh huh. And I suppose it just materialized in front of the Fireplace? We took everything out of it. It was empty. Look, just tell me where she is so we can get on with our day.”

We continued arguing, her accusing me of hiding Misty, and me trying to defend myself. The words got more heated and our voices louder. I ended up going downstairs and collapsing on the couch while she went into the bathroom and slammed the door.

She’d left a Kenny G Christmas album playing on the stereo. As the gooey saxophone ripples started to melt my brain, something came to me.

I got up and eyed the Fireplace again. The scratches in the plastic were deep, deeper than I thought. And given the location of scratched-off pieces, Misty’s claws had dragged…from inside the Fireplace. There was a bit of her gray fur on top of the logs.

I climbed behind it and opened the hatch. Just as I’d expected the slots were empty. All six. 

It clicked then. There had been six presents for six slots. That’s all that could fit in there. 

Where had the other four come from? The shoe, the glasses, the one under the couch, and especially Misty’s collar?

My thoughts were interrupted by the bedroom door slamming. I peeked out from behind the Fireplace to see Meredith coming down the stairs two at a time. Her keys jangled in her hand.

“I’m going out for a while. Maybe I’ll stop by Mom and Dad’s. Please, when I get back, stop the jokes.”

Before I could get a word in edgewise, the door slammed behind her. 

The next thing I knew, I was rummaging around under the couch. It somehow looked worse than the previous morning. The paper was more tattered, and the ribbon practically falling off.

I tore off the lid and peered inside. It was almost funny. A dog collar, with little mistletoes decorating it. I read the name *Benny* on the tag. 

I glanced up. The interior of the Fireplace looked darker than I remembered. I couldn’t even see the back wall behind the logs. With a loud thump, another present came falling out of the chimney, tumbling over itself and landing next to the coffee table.

Something snapped in me then. I don’t know if it was leftover adrenaline from the fight between Meredith and I, the sheer impossibility of it all, or the fact I missed my cat. Before I could stop myself, I was on my hands and knees and crawling inside the fireplace. 

I was slow in raising myself up, crouching slightly to not hit my head on the top of the chimney. I barely registered I was now standing at my full height before feeling around in the darkness for a second hatch, another compartment to put more presents in. But as the cool, almost Arctic air draped down my shoulders, I was increasingly aware that was an impossibility.

My finger pricked on something sharp and I drew back in surprise, banging my elbow on the opposite wall. I reached up again in the gloom and yanked it out.

It was one of Misty’s claws. It had to be. Embedded inside the chimney. A few rows up the fake stones was what appeared to be a fingernail. I spotted a second and third, jutting out from the cracks, as I gazed upward. The chimney continued, well past where it should have stopped, plastic stonework looking more like real masonry, until the shaft disappeared into darkness. 

From somewhere high above, I heard a meow. 

“Misty!?” I cried, momentarily forgetting what a terrible situation I’d gotten myself in. 

The meow came again, and I detected movement just on the edge of the shadows. If I squinted just right, it looked like a cat’s tail, swinging in a slow, lazy arc.

“Misty! That’s it, girl! Come on down!” I stretched up on my tiptoes and reached as far up as I could. When my fingers touched the fur, I registered two things at once.

First, it was cold and stiff. Not like the warm softness of a cat at all.

Second, the tail had come down a bit too far out of the shadows and I saw what was on the end, holding it out like fishing lure. A hand, old, ashen gray, and gnarled. For a moment, I thought I saw a white ruff and a red sleeve behind it.

In the seconds it took to process this, the hand dropped the tail and grasped mine, intertwining our fingers and digging its nails into my palm.

I screamed and tried to pull back, but the grip was like a vice. It began retreating upward, slowly taking me with it. I batted at it weakly with my other hand and tried to grab at something to stop the ascent, but my fingers skated uselessly over the stones. 

With mounting horror, I realized my feet were starting to leave the ground. I swung my legs outwards, trying to hook one of them on the edge of the opening, but missed.

The hand dug its nails in tighter. I felt blood well on my palm and start dripping down my arm.

I swung again and managed to catch my foot on the edge. Instantly a hot bolt of pain shot down my arm, concentrated in my wrist. I flexed my muscles and tried to hold it as long as I could. Wildly looking down, I saw the severed tail lying next to the plastic logs, like a gray worm. I swung my other foot and hooked that one as well, anchoring myself.

The pain in my wrist was getting worse, mounting in intensity with each passing second. Suddenly, a cool rush of air came upon me and something collided with my face. I cried out and nearly lost the leverage. As it slid off and tumbled to the ground below, I barely had time to register a flash of red wrapping paper.

A barrage of presents came after that, falling from the pit above me, each one landing on my head, neck, or face. My wrist felt like someone had poured molten lava on it. I looked, barely moving my head to avoid another falling gift, and looked at the thing grasping me. I could see its fingertips beneath my skin, close to breaking through the back of my hand. 

I felt my leverage start to loosen, the muscles in my legs starting to give out from the exertion. They began to relax slowly, slipping ever closer off the edge. My mind spun wildly and I thought of Meredith coming home to find a particularly large gift waiting for her. One foot slipped away. I closed my eyes…

Suddenly, my whole arm was struck by a bolt of pain. I let out another involuntary scream and the blood that was trickling down suddenly became a river, splattering down onto my face. With a sickening *crack*, the pressure suddenly let go and I was falling. The thing had something in its grip, pale and dripping, as it suddenly vanished upwards into the shadows.

I hit the ground and rolled to the side, banging my head on the plastic logs. Breathing heavily, I dragged myself out of the fireplace, leaving a wet trail behind. The presents were soaked with red. Several more come down the chimney.

I dialed on my phone, staining the screen, and set it on the coffee table. The pain in my wrist had intensified to such a degree I didn’t feel it anymore. Ignoring my slippery fingers, I reached for the nearest present.

I barely registered Meredith’s voice. “Well, are you ready to give up on the charade?”

I tore at the paper, but it wasn’t going fast enough, so I ripped the ribbon off with my teeth. I spat it out and lifted the lid.

“I found Misty. Misty’s here. She was in the Fireplace the whole time.”

Inside the box was a severed finger. A wedding ring sparkled just above the knuckle.

“They’re here too. The previous owners. No trouble getting a hold of them now.”

Gifts were still tumbling out of the fireplace, making a large pile that buried the logs. I tore open another one. An eyeball, dry, the blue of the iris faded to a murky gray.

“Matt. Matt. What are you talking about? You sound insane. Are you okay?”

“Just fine!” I cried, tearing the lid off another. An entire set of dog’s teeth, rattling inside the box like a snake. “You have fun…I’ll stay here and open everything!”

The next box was bigger than the others, and heavier. A few long dark hairs hanging out the end of the lid clued me as to what was inside. 

“What? Matt, please…” but I hung up. 

That was about twenty minutes ago. There’s been several more calls but I’ve ignored them all. The presents continue to drop down the chimney, about one a minute. It’s hard to tear the paper and arrange things with only one hand. But I’m managing. 

It’s easy to follow, like putting a Lego set together. Piece after piece. Pretty soon I’ll have the whole family laid out here on the floor. Mom, Dad, Bobby, and Benny. And Misty! Won’t Merry be pleased to have her back?

The gifts are starting to make quite a mountain. Lots of them are dripping. The carpet is soaked and matted. It’s making a terrible mess. I hope I finish before these black spots at the corners of my eyes go away. ",10,1766502198.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1ptw1lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1ptw1lj/my_will/,My Will,"I have been sitting here for three hours trying to figure out how to start this and I keep deleting sentences because they sound like I am asking for something, I am not asking for anything, I just need to write it down before the thoughts loop again, I have noticed that my mind does this thing now where it replays the same conversations and situations over and over, slightly different each time, and I have tried to stop it but I cannot, it happens when I am trying to sleep or when I am in the shower or when I am supposed to be focusing on something else, my hands shake sometimes for no reason, I noticed it started maybe two years ago, at first I thought it was caffeine but I stopped drinking coffee and it kept happening, I went to a clinic once and the doctor looked at me for maybe four minutes and wrote a prescription and said come back in a month if it does not help, I took the pills for a week and they made everything feel like I was underwater, I could not think clearly so I stopped, the shaking is still there.

I do not know how to talk about myself without sounding like I am complaining or making excuses, that is part of the problem, anytime I have tried to explain what things have been like people either think I am exaggerating or they give advice that does not apply, like just stay positive or things will get better or God does not give you more than you can handle, I have heard all of it and I have nodded and said thank you because that is what you do, but the truth is some people do get more than they can handle, that is just statistically obvious, not everyone makes it and pretending otherwise does not help anyone.

My name does not matter for this, I was born in 1996 in a place that has had four different governments since then, my father worked in construction until an accident with scaffolding damaged his spine, after that he could not do physical labor and he tried to get compensation but the company said it was his fault for not wearing the harness properly even though they never provided harnesses, he ended up doing whatever he could find, delivery jobs, guard work, anything that did not require lifting, my mother worked cleaning houses for families that had money, she came home with her knees hurting and I remember her soaking her feet in warm water every night.

I had two brothers and one sister, my older brother was the smart one, everyone said so, he memorized Quran by the time he was fourteen and he was good at everything, sports, school, people liked him, I was the middle one and I was okay at things but not exceptional, my younger brother had some kind of learning difficulty that no one really named properly, he just struggled and got frustrated and teachers did not know what to do with him, my sister was the youngest and she was quiet, I think she learned early that being quiet made things easier.

When I was twelve my older brother got sick, it started with headaches and then he started having seizures, we took him to a hospital and they did tests and said he needed surgery but it was expensive, we sold everything we could sell, my mother's jewelry, furniture, my father borrowed from relatives and from people who charge interest which he said he would ask forgiveness for later, they did the surgery but something went wrong, an infection maybe or a mistake, I do not know because they never explained it clearly, he died three days after the operation and the hospital gave us a bill for the full amount anyway, my father spent the next six years paying it off, I watched him go to the hospital every month with cash in an envelope, paying for a son who was already gone.

After that the house felt different, my mother cried in ways that had no sound, my father stopped talking about the future, my younger brother got worse because no one was paying attention to him anymore, my sister stayed in her room, I tried to keep things normal but I was twelve and I did not know how, I started doing well in school because it was the only thing that felt like I had control over, I could study and get good marks and maybe that would help somehow.

I was good at math and science, I liked the way problems had solutions, I spent a lot of time on old computers at school and taught myself programming from books and whatever I could find online, there was a competition for students in the region and I entered a project about routing efficiency in networks with unreliable nodes, it was based on the power grid in our area that went out randomly and I had been tracking the patterns, I won second place and got a small scholarship for university, my father smiled for the first time in years, my mother told everyone in the neighborhood.

I went to university in another city and studied computer engineering, I lived in a shared apartment with five other guys and we split rent and made food together and it was okay, I did well enough in my classes, I was not the top student but I was consistent, in my third year I worked with a professor on a research project involving energy optimization in wireless sensor networks, my part was developing an algorithm that reduced power consumption by adjusting transmission intervals based on traffic prediction, I ran simulations for months and wrote most of the code, when the paper got published I was listed as third author even though I did more work than the second author who was the professor's nephew, I did not say anything because I needed the professor's recommendation.

After I graduated I applied for jobs everywhere, I sent applications to companies in the Gulf, in Europe, in Turkey, anywhere that might hire someone with my qualifications, I got a few interviews but nothing worked out, either they wanted someone with more experience or they did not want to sponsor a visa or they just stopped responding, I took a job with a small company that did IT support for businesses, it was not what I studied for but it paid rent, I spent two years doing that, resetting passwords and fixing network issues and explaining to people how to use basic software.

Then I got an offer from a company that seemed legitimate, they had a website and an office and they said they worked with international clients on logistics software, my job was to develop tracking systems for shipments across multiple countries, I was responsible for making sure the data was accurate and the routes were optimized, I worked there for eleven months and the pay was decent and I thought finally things were moving forward, then one day police came to the office and detained three of us, they said the company was involved in moving contraband and that the tracking systems were being used to coordinate illegal shipments, I did not know anything about that, I wrote code based on specifications I was given, I did not ask what was being shipped because that was not my job, but when they investigated they found my name on a lot of the documentation because I was the lead developer for that system.

I got a lawyer who was cheap because I could not afford anyone better, he told me to cooperate and show that I did not know, I did cooperate, I gave them everything, but the prosecutor said ignorance is not an excuse when you are in a technical position, they charged me as an accessory, I got eighteen months, my lawyer said I was lucky it was not more.

Prison is a place where time moves differently, you wake up and eat and wait and eat and wait and sleep and do it again, I was in a cell with nine other men, we had three bunks and people slept in shifts, it smelled like sweat and the toilets barely worked, you learn quickly not to make eye contact and not to ask questions, I kept my head down and prayed five times a day and read whatever books were in the prison library, I read the Quran four times, I read old novels, I read a philosophy book by someone I cannot remember the name of now, it talked about suffering and meaning and I remember thinking that the author had probably never been in a place like this.

Some of the men in there were violent, some were just poor, some were actually guilty of serious things, some were like me, wrong place wrong time, you do not make friends in there, you just survive next to people, there was one guy who had been a teacher before he got caught in some political mess, he tried to kill himself by saving up his medication and taking it all at once, they found him in time and after that he was just blank, I do not know what happened to him.

When I got out I thought I would be able to rebuild, I thought if I explained what happened and showed my work history people would understand, I applied for jobs in tech and every background check stopped the process, I applied for less technical jobs and they asked about the gap in my resume, I tried to be honest and that made things worse, I tried to lie and say I was freelancing and they asked for references I did not have, I applied for three hundred and forty two positions over sixteen months and I kept every rejection email, I got nine interviews, zero offers.

I ended up working at a phone repair shop, the owner paid cash under the table and did not ask questions, I fixed screens and replaced batteries and dealt with customers who yelled at me over things I did not break, the owner skimmed money from what he said he would pay me and I could not complain because I had no leverage, I worked there for two years.

My father died during this time, heart attack, he was sixty one, I could not afford to travel back for the funeral, I called my mother and she cried and said she understood but I know she did not, my sister got married to someone much older, I saw photos, she looked the way my mother used to look, tired, my younger brother I have not spoken to in three years, last I heard he was in trouble again but no one tells me details anymore.

I tried to stay connected to people I knew from university, I reached out to a few who were doing well in other countries, one of them, I will not say his name, he was working for a big company and I asked if there were any openings, I sent him my portfolio, he said he would check, I followed up twice and he said things were complicated, then I saw he posted about a new hire a month later and the job description was almost exactly what I had shown him I could do, I did not say anything, what would I say.

I met someone at a community event, she was kind and we talked for a while, over months I started to feel like maybe I could be honest with someone, I told her about prison and my family and everything, she listened and said it did not define me, we got close, I thought maybe this was something real, then she introduced me to her family and I could tell immediately that they had questions, they asked what I did for work and where I studied and I answered honestly, a few days later she said her parents did not think we were a good match, she apologized and said she tried to convince them but they were worried about stability, I understood, I did not blame her but it still hurt.

I kept praying because it was the only routine I had left that felt like it belonged to me, but I will be honest, a lot of days it felt like I was just saying words, I read tafsir and I read philosophy and I tried to understand what the point was, I read about patience and about tests and about how suffering purifies you, but I did not feel purified, I felt worn down, I read Stoic philosophy about enduring what you cannot control, but enduring is not the same as living.

I watched people around me move forward, get married, have children, buy homes, and I was happy for them, I was, but I also felt like I was watching from behind glass, their problems were solvable, they had bad days but they had systems that worked, they had families that could help, they had records that were clean, I had none of that, and the gap kept getting wider.

My body started breaking down in small ways, I stopped sleeping well, I would lie awake for hours, I started getting stomach problems, I lost weight, people said I looked sick, I went to a doctor and he ran tests and said there was nothing physically wrong, he said it was stress and prescribed me something, I took it for a month and it made me nauseous, I stopped.

I tried to build things on my own, I worked on small projects at night, I thought maybe I could create something and release it and someone would notice, I built a tool for optimizing delivery routes for small businesses that did not have money for expensive software, I posted it online, I got some feedback, a few people used it, no one offered me work, I contributed to open source projects, I fixed bugs, I submitted code, sometimes it got accepted, mostly I was just a username in a list.

The repair shop closed last year, the owner said business was slow, I think he just did not want to deal with it anymore, I have been doing odd jobs since then, tutoring kids in math sometimes, fixing computers for people who find me through word of mouth, it is not consistent, some weeks I make enough for rent and food, some weeks I do not.

I am writing this now because I have been thinking clearly for the first time in a while and I realize that the thoughts are not going to stop looping, I have tried everything I know how to try, I have been patient, I have had faith, I have worked, I have been honest, and none of it has changed the fundamental equation, I do not have the resources to continue and I do not have the energy to keep pretending that I do.

This is not about one thing, people will want to point to one thing, the prison or the job or the family or the loneliness, but it is not one thing, it is all of it together, compounded over years, it is the way systems are built to push certain people out and the way that gets called personal failure, it is the way patience is praised endlessly but no one measures what patience costs.

I do not blame anyone specifically, my parents did what they could, my siblings have their own lives, the people who hurt me were mostly just protecting themselves, I understand all of that, I am not angry, I am just tired in a way that sleep does not fix.

If someone reads this I do not want it to be a lesson, I do not want people to say I should have asked for help because I did, I do not want people to say I should have had more faith because I prayed every single day, I do not want people to say I gave up because I tried for years past the point where trying made sense, I just want it on record that I was here and I tried and the math did not work out, that is all, some equations do not have solutions, this was one of them.",2,1766502051.0,SuicideWatch,0,1.0,False

I got the okay from my surgeon's office to start trying to conceive about 9 months post op (sleeved last December). I got support from my nutritionist, my gp, and got pregnant a few months later. I am 36, almost 11 weeks pregnant. 

I have been struggling with constipation since surgery. Daily emolax helped, and my nutritionist advised me to up my fibre intake to help with feeling full longer and constipation. I was drinking water but my biggest source of liquid intake was very milky decaf coffees. I tried playing with doses of emolax because I noticed if I took it once daily for more than 2 or 3 weeks, I started getting anal leakage, and general gut discomfort. I eased off the emolax for a week and started a probiotic and once my gut was feeling better, reintroduced the emolax. Smooth sailing since.

Well, since becoming pregnant, I have food aversions and my nose is super sensitive. Coffee became my enemy. Water somedays tasted bad. I tried using flavor enhancers but nope. So right there, my fluid intake went way down. The fibre foods I was adding in also started tasting wrong. And, pregnancy hormones can cause constipation. For a month I was struggling. Even glycerine suppositories (safe in pregnancy) did nothing. 

Last week I started getting these horrible upper abdominal pains, like stomach/gallbladder pain (which I knew it couldnt be because my gallbladder was removed when I was sleeved but also the doctor at the ER told me even without a gallbladder you can still have stones!!). 7/10 pain where I couldn't sit, lie down, or stand without pain. Sips of water caused a constant 3/10 pain once the intense pain calmed down. To make a long, long ER visit short, the constipation was causing me severe pain. After 2 enemas I was released with more laxatives, and I have been fighting to get water in me. I have found a good dosing schedule that I am praying doesn't send my gut into chaos again.

So learn from my agony. If you are dealing with constipation and become pregnant, be on top of it! I am feeling much better in that regards, and the little parasite is, so far, healthy. ",1,1766501888.0,gastricsleeve,0,0.67,False

He was planning to jump. We spoke for a while, help arrived, and our lives went in different directions after that.

I never expected to see him again.

Recently I moved to a new area and tried a small sit in coffee shop. One of the baristas felt oddly familiar. After a moment, I realized it was him. He looks different now. Older. Taller. Healthier. Very clearly alive.

I didn’t say anything. I was afraid recognizing him might pull him back into a moment he’s spent years trying to move past. I didn’t want to accidentally reopen something fragile.

When I got my receipt, he had written a note on it.  
“Thank you for saving my life. You have no idea how much I think about you and what you did.”

Now I’m stuck.

**A:** I say hello. I acknowledge what happened. Maybe it brings him some sense of closure or validation. Maybe it means more to him than I realize.

**B:** I leave him alone. I let him keep living his life without dragging him back into one of his darkest moments. Maybe silence is the kinder option.

What makes this hard is that both choices feel selfish in different ways.  
One risks causing harm by reopening old wounds.  
The other risks denying him something he clearly still carries with him.

Instead of changing everything at once, I tried mapping (taste:> likely extraction issue) and turning it into a short decision style quiz:

Bitter :> usually over extraction

Sour :> under extraction

Weak :> ratio or grind mismatch


The idea is to answer a few questions and narrow the problem before adjusting variables.

I’m curious how people here feel about this approach:
Do you think a structured “taste first” quiz actually helps beginners?

Or is hands on dialing in still the only real way?

1ptvqr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NootropicsDepot/comments/1ptvqr8/i_retract_my_prior_statement_about_the/,I retract my prior statement about the inconsistency of the Noble Kava Tablets,"Kava is just plain strange, I’ll say that.  After a couple days of experimentation with three different bottles of ND Noble Kava Tablets to try and assess what exactly is going on here what’s most notable is:  The so-called “reverse tolerance” seems to be in effect with now one tablet feeling considerably stronger than it did previously.  
     Also noting that even the transient nausea I get, particular to quality kava, is back after this morning’s first dose.  Luckily it only lasts about 15 minutes and is actually a sign of quality in my years of drinking kava as weak, impotent kava has little to no GI effects upon administration.
    What I can’t explain is why the first batch I tried had very potent effects from the first dose which then seemed to cease after trying the second batch after a week long break followed by a slow gaining of momentum with successive doses.
      The rest of my stack has stayed the same.  I also don’t think I made it clear enough that I have all the faith one could have in ND’s quality standards, however I’ve had issues with supplement quality from other brands when using Amazon as a carrier (degraded Semax being the standout) so to make it crystal clear.  If there were quality issues it was most likely coming from Amazon’s storage conditions and potential exposure to things like heat and light that would not be used in a nootropic specific warehouse.  Some highly rated, lab tested supplements were a downright dissapointment when they came from Amazon with a number of supplements just sitting uselessly on the back shelf for months.
    Personal sensitivity to kava however is likely the issue.  Also I was not absolutely rigorous with making sure my stomach was completely empty as I have noticed that even milk in coffee drank prior can confound a kava experience and so 8 hours with no calories whatsoever seems to make a positive difference.  So no shade on ND as that nice, clear-headed glow has returned on day three. 
   So upon re-review I’m chalking it up to a pharmacodynamic/kinetic oddity likely unique to kava itself, rather than the specific product.  Kava is a weird substance and inconsistent experiences have happened with other brands, but it seems to come down to most likely needing a full four hours of waiting after ingesting any significant quantity of calories for full clearing of stomach contents as a necessity (at least for myself) for efficacy likely due to bioavailability.  ND remains a superior choice (as with all their products) beating out other kava extracts in which skullduggery including complete active ingredient substitution has been found after analysis in a popular (but cheap) supplement brand which compounds cynicism.   So, if you haven’t tried them the Noble Kava Tablets are quite nice for both working/studying as well as winding down after a long day of it.

1ptvono,https://www.reddit.com/r/SSRIs/comments/1ptvono/i_was_prescribed_prozac_and_i_dont_understand/,I was prescribed prozac and I don't understand what happened to me,"Hi. Six days ago, I was prescribed 10mg of prozac daily for a new diagnosis of OCD and PMDD. 

I was told to take it at night, but it gave me immediate elevated heart rate, so I was told to switch to earlier with a meal. This helped and I was able to sleep, but my dreams were so vivid. I felt like I never really got REM sleep. It felt like my pulse was pounding with excitement.

I was incredibly wired in the first three days. Tons of energy, I didn't need coffee and had no desire for food. I am a BIG coffee drinker but I couldn't even finish my morning cup without shaking and jittering.

I was also feeling bursts of euphoria. Music would make my body tingle. It was like I took ecstacy. I was moving so fast, yet my mind was slower and I lost sense of time perception. Everything was more stimulating. I couldn't feel normal in public - deeply paranoid about how I appeared. It felt like I was coming up on a drug - the nervous energy, agitation, hands shaky, jaw clenching. 

Day 4, the anxiety hit harder than ever. I had my first panic attack. I felt incredibly high. I was close to even having visual disturbance, I felt like even a drop more serotonin and the double vision was about to start. I felt a bit more normal after we went out to a social event and I was distracted, but the nerves were still there. My friends kept telling me it was just my anxiety/OCD amplifying the effects. 

Day 5, I am absolutely bonkers. I paced and paced around my apartment, unable to sit and work at my desk. It was as if my mind and body were separate, I could not understand time and the morning felt so incredibly long. I had a strong crying fit that felt deeply euphoric. I called the psych nurse that prescribed me and told her my symptoms felt extremely psychoactive. She gave me the option to stop the medication if the effects were too intense but recommended pushing through. 

I stopped the meds when I looked in the mirror and didn't see myself. I was so pale, frail and afraid. My pupils were slightly dilated for the last three days. I felt so sick and my thoughts were becoming dark.

It has been more than 24 hrs without a dose and I feel so much better. I just am confused about what happened and why it wasn't taken more seriously. To me, this reaction indicates something more. She suggested we try another SSRI, but I have deeper questions about what happened. ",3,1766501135.0,SSRIs,7,1.0,False
1ptvnf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/movingconfidential/comments/1ptvnf8/tips_for_settling_in_after_a_move_and_actually/,Tips for settling in after a move (and actually feeling at home again),"I thought the hard part was over when the movers drove away. Turns out, the real challenge is remembering which box your coffeemaker is in and why you now own 47 mismatched power cords but zero spoons.

Settling in after a move is weird. You’ve technically “arrived,” but nothing feels quite right yet. You open the fridge and it’s empty. You unpack, but the walls still look bare. And even when everything’s out of boxes, your brain’s like, “Cool, but when do we go home?”

So while I’m somewhere between “almost settled” and “mild chaos,” here’s what’s helped me so far.

**The first few days: pure survival mode**

The first few days after a move feel like a fever dream. You wake up surrounded by boxes, realize you packed your plates under the cat food, and end up eating pizza off a paper towel.

I learned the hard way that unpacking everything at once is a fantasy. The best I could manage was setting up small “zones of sanity:”

* One clean surface (the kitchen counter, maybe).
* One comfy spot to collapse (the couch, or a pile of blankets pretending to be a couch).
* One designated “I don’t know where this goes yet” box that catches all the chaos.

Making your bed helps too. And no, not because it’s Instagram-worthy, but because it’s the only thing that makes you feel like a person again.

The first time I made coffee in my new kitchen, it felt like progress. Not finished, not perfect, just a small win that said, “Okay, maybe I do live here now.”

**Creating comfort: small things that make a big difference**

When people talk about “making a house a home,” they make it sound like some Pinterest project. But comfort doesn’t come from matching furniture; it comes from smell, sound, and routine.

The fastest way to trick your brain into settling in?

Make it smell like you.

I lit my usual candle (the one that smells like vanilla and denial) and it instantly made the space feel less alien.

Music helps too. I threw on the same playlist I used to play on lazy Sunday mornings in my old apartment, and suddenly the walls felt a little less echo-y.

And weirdly enough, hanging one familiar decoration early makes a big difference. You don’t need the whole gallery wall done, just one photo or art piece.

For me, it was a small framed photo of my porch back in Charlotte. Now it sits on the entryway table and quietly reminds me that I’ve done this before. 

I’ve built a home from scratch, one awkward corner at a time.

**Building routines again (or pretending to have your life together)**

The moment that finally made me feel semi-stable? Buying groceries.

I realized that if I kept living off takeout, my body (and wallet) would stage a protest. So I forced myself to do a proper grocery run, which felt alarmingly adult. The first real meal I cooked in the new kitchen was pasta with canned sauce, and it tasted like victory.

That’s when I started rebuilding my small routines: morning coffee in the same corner every day, evening walks around the block, and doing laundry on Sundays like clockwork.

It’s not glamorous, but routines are how your brain rebuilds “normal.” They tell you, “Hey, this is what we do here now.”

The key, though? Keep it low-stakes and don’t expect perfection. 

The first few weeks are less about thriving and more about functioning with style, or at least clean socks.

**Getting out and meeting your new surroundings**

At some point, you realize that your apartment isn’t the only thing that needs unpacking; you do too.

I forced myself to take small walks, even when I didn’t feel like it. There’s something about wandering aimlessly that helps you map the place emotionally as well as physically.

The first time I found a local coffee shop that didn’t make me miss my old one felt like a milestone. I also started saying hi to the same dog-walker every morning; we don’t know each other’s names, but we’ve silently agreed we’re neighbors now.

Exploring doesn’t have to mean socializing right away. Sometimes it’s just learning which grocery store layout makes sense or which park feels right for your evening brain dump. 

It’s about shrinking the “unknown” until it stops feeling foreign.

**The little rituals that make it yours**

One thing I’ve learned: settling in doesn’t happen all at once; it’s death by a thousand little moments.

Like the first time you host a friend and don’t feel embarrassed about the boxes in the corner. Or when you hang your first picture. Or when you realize your cat has officially claimed their favorite sunny spot.

For me, it was cooking a weekend breakfast for the first time with music on, windows open, and coffee brewing. It wasn’t special, but it was mine.

So maybe the trick to settling in is just making small rituals and letting them stack up until the place quietly becomes home.

**Accepting that it takes time (and that’s okay)**

Some days you’ll feel settled, and others you’ll still feel like you’re living in someone else’s life. That’s normal.

You’ll have mornings where you love it and evenings where you miss your old couch or the sound of your neighbor’s car door. It doesn’t mean you made a mistake. It just means you’re still adjusting.

I think the real magic happens when you stop waiting for the day you feel settled and start noticing the small signs that you already are. Those quiet, lived-in details mean more than the big “home reveal” moments ever will.

**So, what are your best tips for settling in?**

What’s helped you feel at home again after a move?

Do you dive right into decorating or ease in slowly? Do you have any little rituals, like a “first-night” pizza tradition, buying new plants, or setting up the kitchen first, that help?

Share your best tips. I’m still figuring this out myself, one box and playlist at a time.

And if nothing else, I’ve learned this much: You can be completely unpacked and still not settled in, but once your place smells like your favorite candle and you can find your scissors on the first try? That’s progress.",1,1766501049.0,movingconfidential,0,1.0,False

Fourth floor, no balcony, just a window that faces another building. My ""backyard birding"" consists of the occasional pigeon convention on the fire escape and if I'm lucky, a house sparrow.

I love birding, but my opportunities are limited to weekend park visits and the rare hiking trip. I've made peace with it, but man, sometimes I just want to check in on birds doing bird things without commuting an hour.

A few months ago, I discovered that people with smart feeders share their live feeds publicly through the app (CoolFly). At first I felt weird about it, you know like I was creeping on someone's backyard. But there's this whole community of people who want to share their visitors with folks who can't have feeders. Or they just genuinely want to share the beautiful birds with bird lovers?

Now I have developed this little morning ritual. Coffee in hand, I hop on the app and check out feeders from around the world. There's this one person in Oregon whose feeder gets Steller's Jays that are absolutely stunning. Someone in Texas gets Green Jays (GREEN JAYS!). A feeder in North Carolina had a Rose-breasted Grosbeak yesterday and I genuinely got excited like it was at my feeder.

The community square feature is honestly kind of beautiful. People post their highlights, you can comment and chat about what showed up, and there's zero gatekeeping. Just bird people sharing birds with other bird people.I am trying to get my mom to put a feeder from coolfly back home in Brooklyn but she's not very interested. 

Mind you, this doesn't replace actual birding for me, nothing beats being out there, but on a random Tuesday when I need a bird fix? It's perfect. I've seen species I'd never encounter in my region, learned about birds I didn't even know existed, and weirdly, I feel more connected to the birding community than ever.

1ptvn4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/interiordecorating/comments/1ptvn4l/need_some_suggestions_on_the_furniture_layout/,Need some suggestions on the furniture layout,"I’ve created a floor plan for my 28 sqm apartment. It’s a very small space, and I’m trying to figure out the best furniture layout, especially the sofa placement. Should the sofa face the window with its back to the kitchen, or face the TV instead?

If the sofa faces the TV, there would be a fairly small unused area in the middle, just behind my computer desk and chair. That makes me wonder whether I should add a coffee table or a stackable dining table and chair set (though I don’t usually have many guests).

Additionally, if the sofa faces the TV, would it make sense to place an IKEA Kallax 4×4 or 5×5 unit behind the sofa to create separation between the living area and the bed?

If the Sofa faces the window, it might give a bit more balance to the space (I have never been good with interior decoration, just saying) but then the food smell when cooking in the open kitchen right behind the sofa could get on the sofa, or am I overthinking this?

I have added the floor plan as well as the actual pictures of the open space, free of all furnitures.

I’m also open to a completely different or more radical reconfiguration of the entire layout. Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks!

I’m nearly 40 and, like a lot of people, I’ve hit a wall with how we’re meant to meet people at this stage of life. Dating apps just feel rushed and transactional. Large social groups feel loud, shallow, and direction-less. I've met a lot of people, but rarely get to actually *know* anyone. Add remote work, isolation, and everyone being scattered across different life phases, and it can feel strangely hard to build anything real, even when you’re open and willing.

Because of that, I recently started experimenting with a small, intentional WhatsApp group in North London for people in their 30s and 40s who want something slower and more human. It’s not specifically a dating group, but more of a place to build meaningful connections with others whether that becomes friendship, companionship, or something deeper.

So, the group works in two connected layers:

Ongoing conversation in the WhatsApp group, using topics or questions to remove the pressure of small talk and help people share how they think, feel, and experience the world over a shared topic. It’s less about opinions and more about perspective, how someone sees things, what matters to them, how they approach life. Over time, that builds familiarity.

Then there are occasional in-person meetups in small groups, usually around six people. Coffee, walks, cinema, drinks, hikes, nothing forced or heavy. The point is that you’re meeting people who already feel a bit familiar, rather than starting from zero each time. It’s meant to mirror how connection used to form more naturally at uni or work, through shared context, continuity, and time.

When I first posted about the idea on Reddit (about a week ago) to see if there was any interest at all, I honestly didn’t expect much. Instead, over 30 people joined in a single day and I had to take the post down because it quickly became more than I could handle at the time as adding people is selective and done manually. I still have another 30+ messages I haven’t replied to. I didn’t expect there to be such an appetite for this kind of thing, but it also made me realise I needed to slow down and focus on quality rather than quantity. I even met a few of the guys/girls and it was an awesome experience.

But here’s where I’m stuck. It seems the vision resonates, but sustaining engagement has been harder than I expected. A few people chat, then things go quiet, and I end up carrying most of the energy. That’s starting to feel exhausting, and I’m trying to understand whether this is just the reality of trying to build something different, or whether there’s something I’m missing.

So I’m genuinely curious:  
– If you’ve been part of groups that actually worked, what helped engagement feel shared rather than driven by one person?  
– What would make *you* feel comfortable speaking up and staying involved in a space like this?

And honestly, if anyone reading this is reflective, chatty, and genuinely looking to build real connection at this stage of life, and the idea resonates, I’m seriously open to hearing from you. Not to recruit numbers, but to find people who see and value the vision I have and actually want to help shape something intentional and human by driving engagement.

I’m posting this here because a lot of what motivated this comes from the same frustrations I see shared on this subreddit every day. It started from a personal place, not as a project, but as an attempt to create the kind of environment I kept wishing existed.

Got home from work and there's this guy I've never seen just sitting on our couch on his phone. My roommate wasn't home.

I stood there for a second not knowing what to do. Finally asked who he was. He looks up and goes oh I'm dropping off a package for Sarah. Like that's a normal reason to be inside someone's apartment.

Turns out my roommate gave him our door code. He's her friend's boyfriend's cousin or something. She didn't ask me. Didn't even tell me he was coming.

I asked her about it when she got home and she said she didn't think it was a big deal because she knows him through her friend. I said I don't know him and she said I'm being paranoid.

This isn't even the first time. Last month she gave the code to some guy who was helping her move a table. Before that it was the cleaning person we hired one time. Her sister has it. Probably other people I don't even know about.

Every time I bring it up she says it's fine because she trusts them. But I don't know these people. And apparently they think it's normal to just let themselves in and sit on the couch.

Oh and the worst part. After he left I checked and there was a half eaten sandwich on the coffee table. He made himself food. In our kitchen. I don't even know what to say about that.

I don't know what to do. Our lock is just one of those keypads the building put in. I can change the code but then I have to give her the new one anyway and she just gives it out again.

I'm so tired of having this same conversation with her. It's like talking to a wall.

That is, until March 29th, 1987, when the choir found out that in a town this old, sometimes the divine listens a bit closer than usual. Meet a congregation about to learn that when you invite the sacred into a place where the walls are already thin, you might get a response you were never prepared for. Tonight, we have a story about faith, silence, and the three minutes that made a church disappear, here, on The Southern Fringe.”*



  
There are no churches in Ash Hollow.

  
Sure, there are some over in The Valley‒ Baptist, Methodist, that non-denominational place in the coffee shop‒ but you won’t find a single one in Ash Hollow. There used to be one, on Old Street, next to what used to be Mrs. Mcallister’s house but now’s got an ice cream shop on the bottom floor, and across from the Vinyl Vortex and Doc’s clinic. Now it’s just an empty lot, wedged between two buildings. Nothing’s been built there since, and I don’t think anything will ever be built there again.

  
The old-timers don’t really talk about it much. If you ask why there’s no churches, they’ll just shrug and say how it’s “easier” to just drive twenty minutes over to The Valley on Sundays if you really want to worship. But if you go over to The Green Hearth late enough, after enough beer, somebody might lean over and tell you what they think the real reason is. They’ll tell you about St. Francis. About how it stood tall in that lot for over 100 years, since the founding days, before they tore it down. The stories change depending on who’s telling it, but they all agree on one thing: something happened there before they tore it down. Something on a Sunday morning that nobody can quite remember, and nobody’s even thought about building a new church there since. 



Some folks say that if you stand in that lot on a foggy Sunday morning, and if you’re real quiet and really lucky, you can hear them. Eighteen voices singing a song that hasn’t been heard in Ash Hollow in over 30 years. They say if you hear it, the song never finishes. It just stops, halfway through the song like somebody pulled the plug.



Most people avoid that lot on Sundays.

**Agent Dailey’s Interview:**



**Overseeing Team-** Field Team 2



**Date-** March 29, 1987



**Location-** Big Al’s Steakhouse, spare room.



**Conducting Interviewer-** Agent James Murphy



**Recorder and note-taker-** Agent Milly Bohmer.



**Interviewee-** Agent John Dailey





**Murphy**: Ya’ll mind if I smoke?



**Bohmer:** No, sir. Go ahead.



**Dailey**: Only if you’re not sharing.



**\[sound of lighter, exhaled smoke. 47 second pause\]**



**Murphy:** This is Agent James Murphy, P.R.I.M.E. Clearance Black, conducting formal interview with Agent John Dailey, P.R.I.M.E. Clearance Blue, regarding the events of P.O.E. number 1834. Assisting me is Agent Milly Bohmer on tape recorder and notebook, P.R.I.M.E. Clearance Black. You ever done one of these before, Dailey?



**Dailey \[laughing\]:** You kiddin’? I’ve been on assignment here for ten years, I probably know more about Ash Hollow and P.O.E. interviews than anybody else in P.R.I.M.E.



**Murphy:** Then this should be quick. Let’s get the BS out of the way first. Can you tell me what your assignment is?



**Dailey:** My assignment in one word is recon. I’m a plant agent, meant to watch the town for any Paranatural Activity and act as an early warning system. I live like ‘em, eat where they do, go to work in an office over in The Valley. Hell, two years ago I married a girl from here because the locals kept trying to set me up.



**Murphy:** Thank you. Now, do you mind, in your own words, telling me what happened this morning?



**Dailey:** “It was a normal Sunday, man. Normal as it gets in this backwoods town, anyway. I woke up, had some coffee at the diner, and went to church. 



**Murphy:** The church still named St. Francis? 



**Dailey:** Yep. Been renovated a few times over the years since I got here, but still the same name. I should’ve known it was gonna be a weird day, though.



**Murphy:** Why?



**Dailey:** They was all excited about this new hymn they’d heard about. ‘As the Deer.’ Some shit from out Texas-ways, I don’t know. Anyway, they were all excited for some new church music, right? That should’ve tipped me off. Whenever the people get too excited, weird shit starts happening. You heard of The Garth Lake Incident?



**Murphy:** P.O.E. 1584. “The Corpses in Garth Lake.”



**Dailey \[making two finger-guns at Agent Murphy\]:** Right. Well, the guy I replaced worked on that P.O.E., he was the one that found the bodies floating in the lake. He was working when The Fog came in, too, back in the 40s. He told me to always be on the lookout around the Possum Party each spring, and whenever something got them so excited you could feel it in the air. Well, you could feel it when Pastor Mike told ‘em about it a couple weeks ago, how it spoke to him, how pure it was, how the choir was practicing with their whole soul to get the song ready. I should’ve noticed it, but it had been so long since a P.O.E. had shown itself, I guess I got nose-blind to it. 



**Murphy \[making a spinning motion with his finger\]:** We’ve gotten off track. What happened today, Dailey?



**Dailey:** Right, yeah. So today the service starts normal, but you can tell they’re rushing through morning sermons. Pastor Mike does his usual‒ the evils of lust and greed, preaching about pride in the community, and then it’s time to sing. The choir comes out in their little robes, couple of the kids mixed in this time. None of the townsfolk know the words yet, so our job was to let the choir take the lead this time till everyone could sing it.



Anyway, they start singing. And they’re doing *good.* Better than any song they’d ever done before. They was feeling it, really feeling it. And you could tell they’d put in the work. They’re doing so good, they got the whole congregation swaying along, some folks got their eyes closed, not a single beat out of time. For three solid verses it’s the most beautiful damned thing I’ve ever heard.



Then someone cuts the fucking power.



**Murphy:** Explain.



**Dailey:** It’s like somebody turned a radio off. They all stopped singing at the exact same time. Not like they finished a verse or took a pause or missed a cue, they all just stopped. Like you stopped a tape mid-word. All 18 of ‘em. Frozen. Staring at the back wall.



**Murphy:** At what? Anything specific?



**Dailey:** Nothing. Just the back wall. There’s an old wooden cross on the wall Pastor Mike’s grandad carved himself, but they weren’t staring at that. It was like they was looking through the wall at something else, something only they could see. Just staring, and mumbling.



**Murphy:** Did you hear the mumbling yourself?



**Dailey:** Barely. It was so quiet in the church you could hear a fly fart. But you could hear ‘em mumbling, faintly, under their breath. Couldn’t make out the words, but it was this low, constant sound. Like they were saying the same thing out of sync with each other. 



**Murphy:** What did you do?



**Dailey:** I knew I’d need to call it in, but my first job is to observe so I can tell you guys what happened. I start my watch the second I realize this wasn’t part of their performance. Three minutes, man. Three entire minutes they stand there, not moving, just staring and mumbling. Poor locals didn’t know what to do. People started standing up, Mrs. Owens went to check on her daughter in the choir, somebody’s kid started crying. But the choir was just statues.



**Murphy:** And then?



**Dailey:** They all blink. Same time, like they woke up from a nap or stopped holding their breath all at once or something. Looked around confused, asked why everybody was staring at them, if they liked the song. Not a single one of the choir remembers those three minutes.



**Murphy:** You’re certain?



**Dailey:** Oh yeah. I stuck around after and talked to a few of them, casual-like. Every one of them thinks they finished the song. No gaps, no lost time, they genuinely believe nothing happened.



**Murphy:** Your assessment?



**\[Long pause, cigarette lighting\]**



**Dailey:** Dollars to donuts, it was that **\[REDACTED\]**.



**Murphy:** Bohmer, redact that for any agent below Black status. Now, how do you know about that, Mr. Dailey?



**Dailey:** Hell, everyone in town knows about **\[REDACTED\]**. The people here just don’t talk about it. I’d be willing to bet they won’t be talking about this either for a good long while, either. They’re just gonna say “sometimes weird things happen” like they always do. You don’t know what it’s like in this town. Freaky shit happens all the damn time. Hell, just a few months ago poor Mrs. Thompson disappeared for like three weeks and comes out of the woods like she never went missing. Can’t remember a thing. You don’t know how it is, man.



**Bohmer:** Agent Dailey, do you not know who you’re talking to? 



**Dailey:** Should I?



**Bohmer:** This is THE Agent James Murphy jr. Paranatural Trooper number 1.



**Dailey:** Code-named Hillbilly?



**Murphy:** That is, unfortunately, my callsign. I was born and raised here, and I loved every second of it, even with the weird things. Left when I was 20. Long time ago.



**Dailey:** No shitting? What’s a PT doing down here? I thought you guys’s only job was catching P.O.C.s?



**Murphy:** I don’t usually take Ash Hollow assignments, but this one caught my attention.



**Dailey:** So was the weird stuff like this when you were living here?



**Murphy:** Weird things happened, but nothing like this. Not until right before I joined P.R.I.M.E., anyway. 



**Dailey:** Listen, you know how it is, then. I need a transfer. Please, I’ve been begging for one but nobody will let me out.



**Murphy:** We have to have a plant, Dailey. There must always be someone in Ash Hollow.



**Dailey:** Then find someone else. I can’t take this much more. I’m one more spook away from eating my gun.



**Murphy:** What about your wife?



**Dailey:** Let her come with me, or Burn my records, I don’t care. Just get me out of here.



**Murphy \[sighing\]:** Noted. We can discuss the possibility of reassignment after the investigation. For now, interview concluded. Let’s grab some coffee and talk to the Burn Unit. 



**\[END OF INTERVIEW\]**



**Investigation Findings:**



Field Team 2 conducted interviews in the weeks following P.O.E. 1834. The congregation of The Church of St. Francis corroborates Agent Dailey’s story‒ there is nothing further to be gained from interviewing the people who merely witnessed the event. Initial interviews with all 18 people were conducted as quickly as possible following the P.O.E, and follow-up interviews were also conducted.



**Interview Notes:**



Summary of interviews across all 18 choir members is as follows. For in-depth interview records, please see **\[REDACTED\]**.



* Zero memory retention of the three-minute gap. When asked to give their account of the events of Sunday, March 29, 1987, all choir members believed they had completed “As the Deer” without incident.



* When asked to hum or sing the hymn during the second interviews, all subjects stopped at the exact same verse in the middle of verse four. Each subject exhibited visible distress when reaching this point. Two subjects, Ivy Hely and Eric Mayes requested their interviews be terminated. 



* All subjects, without prompting, reported the same recurring dream beginning on the night of March 29th, 1987, and continuing for a minimum of six weeks until investigation was suspended on May 12, 1987. As of May 10th, Jay Richards is still experiencing the recurring dream. **Recommendation: 10 year Wellness Overwatch placed on Jay Richards.**



**Dream Content:**



The contents of the recurring dream is consistent across all 18 subjects. Tests have been conducted to ensure imprinting has not occurred. The P.O.E. Psychology Department ensures the memories of the dream are genuine.

  
The dream begins with the subject standing in a forest clearing at dawn. Initial theories of this clearing being the same as the one housing the \*\*\\\[REDACTED\\\]\*\* Cabin have been dismissed. The clearing is full of flowers, but each subject recounts seeing different flowers. 

  
The subject turns, claiming to have heard something in the dream, and seeing something moving along the treeline. Out of all 18 choir members, none could identify the species of the creature moving among the treeline. Some stated it was bipedal, some claimed it to have moved on all fours. 

  
When they turn in the dream to watch the thing moving in the treeline, each claims that a sort of music begins to play. According to the subjects, it was not from an instrument, but a kind of humming. They claim it to be a music that “no human could ever make” (exact phrasing by all 18 subjects). Despite this, each claims that they never felt threatened, quite the opposite. Each subject also recounts “getting the best sleep \\\[they’ve\\\] ever had” after waking up from the dreams.

  
When asked to draw their dream during the third interview, each subject drew the same image. A spiral of antlers radiating from a central point.



**Physical Evidence:**



* No gas leaks were detected in the church or surrounding buildings



* No environmental toxins detected



* Analysis of service recording from a home video recording the P.O.E. shows exactly three minutes of silence with subsonic vibration at 18-22 Hz. Well below normal, but consistent with the “feelings” reported by the congregation members watching the P.O.E.



* Paranatural evidence undeniable



**Behavioral Outcomes:**



* Within four weeks of the P.O.E., three choir members (Denise Chen, Robert Halloway, Lewis Walsh) abruptly left Ash Hollow permanently. 



* Pastor Mike requested a sabbatical. Is unlikely to return.



* The Church has been Burned. Nothing remains. As usual, and as Agent Dailey predicted, nobody in town has spoken of it publicly. The site is under standard 14 week surveillance.



* No attempts to rebuild the church or build a new church within Ash Hollow’s city limits have been discussed. Those wishing to worship now travel to The Valley on Sundays.



**Assessment:** 



Event classified as Class I P.O.E.- localized, non-violent, likely benevolent but of unknown long-term effect. Despite this, the site demonstrated residual paranatural activity that, if left unchecked, would have likely led to the development of further P.O.E. manifestations. The decision was made to eliminate this focal point by Burning the site.



**Afterwards:**



The official cover story, which was disseminated on March 31, 1987, is as follows: A natural gas leak from beneath the church of St. Francis caused a mass hallucination event. The church was declared structurally unsound, and was bulldozed.



 	P.O.E. 1834 is consistent with manifestations of the entity known as **\[REDACTED\]** (See files: Ash Hollow Historical Overview, Celtic Manifestation Index). The Experience was likely non-hostile. The current theory is that the choir’s focused worship with hymn’s thematic content (deer/nature) created Resonance with resident Entity. Response appears to have been acknowledgment rather than aggression.



**Recommendation:**



Continue monitoring. Agent Dailey to remain in place until suitable replacement with **\[REDACTED\]** Affinity can be found. Ash Hollow’s Paranatural stability remains Level Orange.



**Final Thoughts:**



Growing up in Ash Hollow, we’re taught to respect nature, respect the town, otherwise The Dibber will come and get you. My mother told me that as a way to keep me from going into the woods too late, and my grandmother believed them literally. 



Initially, I believed The Dibber and **\[REDACTED\]** were the same thing. However, reading the case files for hundreds of P.O.E.s within Ash Hollow have taught me that they are in fact separate entities. Whereas **\[REDACTED**\], much like his siblings, is not a threat to humans, The Dibber, better known as **\[REDACTED\]**, or the thing Carter Vanhaussen nearly released during the events of P.O.E. 854, is actively hostile to anything that lives. When **\[REDACTED\]** is healthy, Ash Hollow thrives. The land is healthy. When it is not, the land suffers, and The Dibber begins to manifest. P.O.E. 1238, The Fog, is a perfect example of what happens when the balance tips.



This, in the mind of **\[REDACTED\]**, was a reward for those it saw to be faithful. But what troubles me is the people that left. Two of the people were not natives, but Lewis Walsh’s family goes back generations. In Ash Hollow, where your roots are more important than anywhere else, that takes a lot. 



My recommendation: monitor the choir members. If they start drawing the spirals again, or if the dreams come back, we need to know. 



P.S. Somebody get Agent Dailey a vacation before he snaps.



\-J.M. jr.



*“The choir of St. Francis wanted to bring something pure to Ash Hollow that morning. It was a hymn of longing, one about seeking the divine the way a deer seeks water. In a way, they got exactly what they asked for. That morning, eighteen voices called out, and something ancient answered in a way human minds weren’t built to hear. They don’t remember those three minutes of silence, which is perhaps the only mercy they received. But the dreams remember. The three who fled remember. And on foggy Sunday mornings, the empty lot remembers too.*



*“There are no churches in Ash Hollow anymore. Perhaps that’s wise, maybe it’s tragedy, or it might just be proof that when you call into the deep places of the world you should be prepared for it to call back.*



*“Welcome to a place where hymns create hauntings.*



*“Welcome to a place where memory acts as a shield and a prison.*



*“Welcome to a place where three minutes erased over a century of faith.*



*“Welcome to…The Southern Fringe.”*",1,1766500586.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

That is, until March 29th, 1987, when the choir found out that in a town this old, sometimes the divine listens a bit closer than usual.

Tonight, we have a story about faith, silence, and the three minutes that made a church disappear, here, on The Southern Fringe.”*



  
There are no churches in Ash Hollow.

  
Sure, there are some over in The Valley‒ Baptist, Methodist, that non-denominational place in the coffee shop‒ but you won’t find a single one in Ash Hollow. There used to be one, on Old Street, next to what used to be Mrs. Mcallister’s house but now’s got an ice cream shop on the bottom floor, and across from the Vinyl Vortex and Doc’s clinic. Now it’s just an empty lot, wedged between two buildings. Nothing’s been built there since, and I don’t think anything will ever be built there again.

  
The old-timers don’t really talk about it much. If you ask why there’s no churches, they’ll just shrug and say how it’s “easier” to just drive twenty minutes over to The Valley on Sundays if you really want to worship. But if you go over to The Green Hearth late enough, after enough beer, somebody might lean over and tell you what they think the real reason is. They’ll tell you about St. Francis. About how it stood tall in that lot for over 100 years, since the founding days, before they tore it down. The stories change depending on who’s telling it, but they all agree on one thing: something happened there before they tore it down. Something on a Sunday morning that nobody can quite remember, and nobody’s even thought about building a new church there since. 



Some folks say that if you stand in that lot on a foggy Sunday morning, and if you’re real quiet and really lucky, you can hear them. Eighteen voices singing a song that hasn’t been heard in Ash Hollow in over 30 years. They say if you hear it, the song never finishes. It just stops, halfway through the song like somebody pulled the plug.



Most people avoid that lot on Sundays.

* When asked to hum or sing the hymn during the second interviews, all subjects stopped at the exact same verse in the middle of verse four. Each subject exhibited visible distress when reaching this point. Two subjects, Ivy Hely and Eric Mayes requested their interviews be terminated. 



* All subjects, without prompting, reported the same recurring dream beginning on the night of March 29th, 1987, and continuing for a minimum of six weeks until investigation was suspended on May 12, 1987. As of May 10th, Jay Richards is still experiencing the recurring dream. **Recommendation: 10 year Wellness Overwatch placed on Jay Richards.**



**Dream Content:**



The contents of the recurring dream is consistent across all 18 subjects. Tests have been conducted to ensure imprinting has not occurred. The P.O.E. Psychology Department ensures the memories of the dream are genuine.

  
The dream begins with the subject standing in a forest clearing at dawn. Initial theories of this clearing being the same as the one housing the \*\*\\\[REDACTED\\\]\*\* Cabin have been dismissed. The clearing is full of flowers, but each subject recounts seeing different flowers. 

  
The subject turns, claiming to have heard something in the dream, and seeing something moving along the treeline. Out of all 18 choir members, none could identify the species of the creature moving among the treeline. Some stated it was bipedal, some claimed it to have moved on all fours. 

  
When they turn in the dream to watch the thing moving in the treeline, each claims that a sort of music begins to play. According to the subjects, it was not from an instrument, but a kind of humming. They claim it to be a music that “no human could ever make” (exact phrasing by all 18 subjects). Despite this, each claims that they never felt threatened, quite the opposite. Each subject also recounts “getting the best sleep \\\[they’ve\\\] ever had” after waking up from the dreams.

  
When asked to draw their dream during the third interview, each subject drew the same image. A spiral of antlers radiating from a central point.



**Physical Evidence:**



* No gas leaks were detected in the church or surrounding buildings



* No environmental toxins detected



* Analysis of service recording from a home video recording the P.O.E. shows exactly three minutes of silence with subsonic vibration at 18-22 Hz. Well below normal, but consistent with the “feelings” reported by the congregation members watching the P.O.E.



* Paranatural evidence undeniable



**Behavioral Outcomes:**



* Within four weeks of the P.O.E., three choir members (Denise Chen, Robert Halloway, Lewis Walsh) abruptly left Ash Hollow permanently. 



* Pastor Mike requested a sabbatical. Is unlikely to return.



* The Church has been Burned. Nothing remains. As usual, and as Agent Dailey predicted, nobody in town has spoken of it publicly. The site is under standard 14 week surveillance.



* No attempts to rebuild the church or build a new church within Ash Hollow’s city limits have been discussed. Those wishing to worship now travel to The Valley on Sundays.



**Assessment:** 



Event classified as Class I P.O.E.- localized, non-violent, likely benevolent but of unknown long-term effect. Despite this, the site demonstrated residual paranatural activity that, if left unchecked, would have likely led to the development of further P.O.E. manifestations. The decision was made to eliminate this focal point by Burning the site.



**Afterwards:**



The official cover story, which was disseminated on March 31, 1987, is as follows: A natural gas leak from beneath the church of St. Francis caused a mass hallucination event. The church was declared structurally unsound, and was bulldozed.



 	P.O.E. 1834 is consistent with manifestations of the entity known as **\[REDACTED\]** (See files: Ash Hollow Historical Overview, Celtic Manifestation Index). The Experience was likely non-hostile. The current theory is that the choir’s focused worship with hymn’s thematic content (deer/nature) created Resonance with resident Entity. Response appears to have been acknowledgment rather than aggression.



**Recommendation:**



Continue monitoring. Agent Dailey to remain in place until suitable replacement with **\[REDACTED\]** Affinity can be found. Ash Hollow’s Paranatural stability remains Level Orange.



**Final Thoughts:**



Growing up in Ash Hollow, we’re taught to respect nature, respect the town, otherwise The Dibber will come and get you. My mother told me that as a way to keep me from going into the woods too late, and my grandmother believed them literally. 



Initially, I believed The Dibber and **\[REDACTED\]** were the same thing. However, reading the case files for hundreds of P.O.E.s within Ash Hollow have taught me that they are in fact separate entities. Whereas **\[REDACTED**\], much like his siblings, is not a threat to humans, The Dibber, better known as **\[REDACTED\]**, or the thing Carter Vanhaussen nearly released during the events of P.O.E. 854, is actively hostile to anything that lives. When **\[REDACTED\]** is healthy, Ash Hollow thrives. The land is healthy. When it is not, the land suffers, and The Dibber begins to manifest. P.O.E. 1238, The Fog, is a perfect example of what happens when the balance tips.



This, in the mind of **\[REDACTED\]**, was a reward for those it saw to be faithful. But what troubles me is the people that left. Two of the people were not natives, but Lewis Walsh’s family goes back generations. In Ash Hollow, where your roots are more important than anywhere else, that takes a lot. 



My recommendation: monitor the choir members. If they start drawing the spirals again, or if the dreams come back, we need to know. 



P.S. Somebody get Agent Dailey a vacation before he snaps.



\-J.M. jr.



*“The choir of St. Francis wanted to bring something pure to Ash Hollow that morning. It was a hymn of longing, one about seeking the divine the way a deer seeks water. In a way, they got exactly what they asked for. That morning, eighteen voices called out, and something ancient answered in a way human minds weren’t built to hear. They don’t remember those three minutes of silence, which is perhaps the only mercy they received. But the dreams remember. The three who fled remember. And on foggy Sunday mornings, the empty lot remembers too.*



*“There are no churches in Ash Hollow anymore. Perhaps that’s wise, maybe it’s tragedy, or it might just be proof that when you call into the deep places of the world you should be prepared for it to call back.*



*“Welcome to a place where hymns create hauntings.*



*“Welcome to a place where memory acts as a shield and a prison.*

I'd wake up, grab my phone to check the time, and suddenly find myself 45 minutes deep in social media before even getting out of bed. By the time I'd start my day, I already felt behind and defeated. What finally worked wasn't an elaborate morning routine or motivation quotes it was an embarrassingly simple rule.

For the first five minutes after waking up, my phone stays untouched and I must physically leave my bedroom. I immediately do one small action that sets a positive direction for my day. Sometimes it's just filling my water bottle, setting up the coffee maker, or opening the blinds to let natural light in. Other days it's laying out my workout clothes or writing down three priorities on a sticky note.

Most days, those five minutes create enough momentum to keep me moving forward. Even on my worst mornings, I've at least avoided the spiral of immediately surrendering my attention to whatever notifications appeared overnight.

It's not sophisticated or inspiring, but it works more reliably than any complex system I've tried because it eliminates the single behavior that consistently derailed me reaching for my phone before my feet hit the floor. The barrier between a productive day and a wasted one was never motivation or willpower, but simply those first few moments of consciousness and what I did with them.",2,1766500412.0,TheImprovementRoom,1,1.0,False
1ptvd2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Proust/comments/1ptvd2t/i_brought_proust_to_a_selfimprovement_book_club/,"I brought Proust to a ""Self-Improvement"" book club, and it was a disaster. Here is why that makes me hopeful.","I recently attended a local reading group held in a chain coffee shop. The vibe was frantic. People arrived late, quickly ordered the minimum required coffee, and opened their notebooks.

The hit of the night was a finance book about ""optimizing asset allocation."" One guy, a habitual note-taker, scribbled furiously, terrified of missing a single profitable sentence.

Then, it was my turn. I introduced **Marcel Proust’s In Search of Lost Time.**

[The \\""World\\"" of Proust: A 19th-century salon where art, not utility, was the currency. \(Image Source: WordPress\)](https://preview.redd.it/e3h1ma52sy8g1.jpg?width=584&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c34546fdfde8686a5f1af855ed353421d7d96f5)

The room went silent. The scratching of pens stopped. Eyes glazed over. Someone checked their phone. Finally, a tired-looking attendee asked, ""But is it useful? Like, what’s the takeaway?""

That moment stayed with me. It made me realize we are living in the era of the **""Tool Book.""**

**The Obsession with Utility**  
We seem to have lost the ""Salon"" culture. We don't discuss art or existence anymore; we discuss survival.

* **Finance books** teach us how not to be swallowed by capitalism.
* **Self-help books** teach us how to not have a mental breakdown while being swallowed.

We are so obsessed with turning our brains into ""efficient machines"" that reading fiction—especially something as dense and slow as Proust—feels like a waste of time. As Byung-Chul Han argues in The Burnout Society, we are patients in a high-pressure emergency room; nobody wants to hear poetry, they want a cure.

**Why AI Makes Proust More Important**  
Here is my hot take: **In the age of AI, ""Utility"" is a losing game.**

If you are reading books just to learn a formula, a template, or a communication hack, an LLM (Large Language Model) can already do that better than you. AI creates the ultimate ""Standard Operating Procedure.""

But AI cannot feel the taste of a madeleine dipped in tea. It cannot experience the irrational, non-structural ""tremor"" of jealousy, memory, and time that Proust describes.

**Literature as the Last Sanctuary**  
The awkward silence in that coffee shop made me realize that reading literature is now an act of rebellion. It is a refusal to be a machine.

* It calibrates our sensitivity.
* It helps us identify self-deception.
* It reveals how time shapes us.

It won't make you rich. It won't get you a promotion. But it might make you hate yourself a little less at 3 AM when the world is quiet.

I realized that **uselessness is the point.** It’s the only thing AI can’t replicate.

**Question for you all:**  
Do you feel this pressure to only read ""useful"" non-fiction? Do you think the ability to appreciate ""slow"" literature is becoming a lost art, or am I just being too pessimistic?

I wrote a longer reflection on this ""Salon Culture vs. Survival Anxiety"" and the economics of reading Proust. If you're interested in the full essay, you can read it here:

I live with one roommate. We split rent evenly and generally get along, but she has one habit that I think is over the top. She labels every single grocery item she buys. Milk, eggs, leftovers, butter, frozen food, everything has her name written on it.

I respected it at first. I really did. I bought my own groceries and stayed on my side. But over time it started feeling ridiculous, especially since we often buy the exact same items. Same milk, same eggs, same brand. The only difference is hers has her name written on it like we live in a shared office fridge.

One morning I was making breakfast and realized I was out of eggs. Hers were unopened. I used two eggs and planned to replace them later. I honestly did not think it was a big deal. She noticed and confronted me, saying I violated her boundaries.

I told her I would replace them and that it felt excessive to treat groceries like personal property in a shared apartment. She disagreed and told me very clearly not to touch her food again.

Here is where people will probably say I am the asshole.

After that, I still used small amounts of her stuff when I ran out. Milk for coffee, butter, oil. I told myself that roommates do this all the time and that as long as I replaced it, it was fine. Sometimes I replaced it quickly. Sometimes I forgot. I do not think that makes me a bad person.

Last week she sat me down and said she felt disrespected and could not trust me. She said she labels food specifically so this would not happen. I told her that labeling everything creates a hostile environment and that living together means sharing occasionally. I also told her that if she wanted total control over her food, she should keep it in her room or get a mini fridge.

Now she barely speaks to me and has started keeping groceries locked in her room. Our mutual friends say I am obviously the asshole because she asked me to stop and I did not. I understand that, but I still think her system is unreasonable and creates unnecessary tension.

I admit I ignored her request, but I genuinely feel like I should not have to live like I am trespassing in my own kitchen.",0,1766499975.0,AITAH,60,0.25,False
1ptv7wb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/1ptv7wb/significant_improvement_in_symptoms/,Significant improvement in symptoms,"Quick background to symptoms I’ve been suffering for the last 2 years or so:

\- chronic pain in joints and muscles despite doing little to no exercise

\- regular tension headaches and migraines

\- constantly tense and tender muscles

\- constant twitches in back, ribs, arms, legs, eyelids, neck, perineum, practically everywhere, some days worse than others

Over the last few months (since around September) I’ve noticed a significant improvement. Here’s what I‘ve been doing:

—Lifestyle-related—

\- making sure I get to bed at a reasonable time and get at least 7 hours

\- after waking up, going for a brisk morning walk - this is a natural source vitamin D and just nice to clear my head for the day ahead (especially great since I work from home so I often don’t get out in the morning)

\- for breakfast I eat a banana and some probiotic yoghurt (this is unchanged from before so probably not part of the solution, just for reference)

\- I slowly reduced my caffeine intake down to zero (I used to drink 3 or 4 cups of coffee every day)

\- I stopped researching all of the worst case scenario diseases because I’ve had enough tests to pretty much rule out that sort of stuff

\- I started researching about what vitamins and/or minerals could possibly cause the sorts of symptoms I’ve been having

—Vitamins/supplements—

My googling brought me to several possible culprits in terms of pain, nerve issues and twitching, including:

\- Vitamin B12

\- Vitamin B6

\- Folate

\- Magnesium

—

I started taking a mix of supplements that altogether give me:

\- 1000mcg B12

\- 30mg B6

\- 25mcg Vitamin D3

After about two weeks on this mix of supplements I noticed a significant reduction in twitches, headaches, and my random muscle and joint pain had vanished almost entirely. It may sound outlandish and I was equally (pleasantly) surprised.  
\--

Just a few days ago I did an OligoScan test (basically a laser device that can measure mineral content in your body instantly), which found that I’m severely deficient in magnesium and moderately deficient in iodine. It’s not cheap but I highly recommend if you can afford it.

I also got blood tests back showing I don’t have a deficiency in B12 or B6 after all.

As a result (with the exception of Vitamin D) I’ve decided to halve the supplement dose I mentioned above.

The doctor recommended me a magnesium supplement that I also started taking as of a few days ago (100mg per day for now, although this probably isn’t enough to completely replete my body, my googling suggests I need more like 300mg-400mg).

So now my dose regime is:

\- 500mcg Vitamin B12

\- 15mg Vitamin B6

\- 25 mcg Vitamin D3 (unchanged)

\+ 100mg Magnesium (sulfate)

—

Although I apparently dont have a B12 deficiency, I noticed a huge different after starting on the supplement so it must have done something, which is why I decided to keep taking it. Besides, excess B12 comes out in your urine so there’s no real harm in continuing. B6 may require monitoring (ironically overdosing B6 can apparently lead to nerve issues).

—

To give you a sense of the scale of improvement:

—Before September 2025—

\- Very frequent headaches

\- Almost constant body pain

\- Could not go even 30 seconds without a twitch somewhere on my body

—Late December 2025—

\- Occasional headaches but greatly reduced in both frequency and severity

\- Random body pain is, I would say, 95% gone

\- After starting on the initial set of supplements I started going a solid 30 minutes without any twitches at all

\- After adding magnesium I can now go hours without any twitches whatsoever

—

This is just my personal experience with my body. I have no idea if it will work for anyone else but at least with B12 there’s no real down side for most people. Also with magnesium, it seems we should aim for 300mg-400mg per day depending on gender and body weight etc, so you could start conservative like me and just see what happens.

One thing I’ve found useful is to note down in my phone every time I get a twitch (when, where, how intense) every day and then each week I copy paste it into ChatGPT and ask it to analyze and provide a summary of the general direction of my symptoms.

—To close—

I‘ve spent the last two years battling with doctors telling me it’s in my head, trying to put me on antidepressants, anticonvulsants, painkillers, sleeping pills, etc etc, so I can 100% relate to how it feels to feel ignored and not believed.

I hope this is helpful to at least one person and I’m happy to answer questions.

—Disclaimer—

Im not a doctor or a medical professional.

General warning: you generally should not supplement things you’re not deficient in. In some cases, supplementing beyond the recommended dose is not only not useful but can be toxic and cause health issues.

We’ve known each other for about a month through a group of mutual friends (I’m 33, he’s 34).

We first met at a group hangout and barely talked. Later we chatted for a couple of days, and since it flowed, he suggested meeting up for coffee to talk in person rather than text. I had exams, so we didn’t plan anything right away and didn’t really stay in touch by text.

We saw each other again at another group hangout, said hi and bye, and about a week later had our first one-on-one hangout. It felt easy and natural, just talking and walking. Nothing physical happened besides a friendly hug. The next day, he texted saying he felt comfortable with me, found me gorgeous, and wanted to see me again. We then planned to go to the theater. He suggested coffee before or dinner after, and since it was a Friday I said I could stay for dinner. He mentioned either finding a place to eat or having me over to cook. I told him I prefer to get to know someone slowly, and he was very respectful, thanked me for being honest, and said he’d look for a restaurant instead.

Between “dates,” we don’t text at all, no daily chatting. Most of our interaction happens in person. **Is that normal?** I actually don’t mind not texting; it makes me anxious and feel attached before really getting to know someone.

So my question is: **does this sound more like friendship or romantic interest?**  
And if a guy invites you to dinner at his place this early on, does it usually mean he expects to hook up? It feels like a big jump in intimacy since we’ve barely had physical contact.

2. Fabricating CB is hell, in most cases not even possible, majority of my wars were no CB with stability cost
3. Supressing rebels by armies did not work for me, for the most cases I let rebels pop and pacfied them in few minutes.
4. Building armies without blueprints is annoying, if I want to add unit to my army, game zooms to a random location nowhere near my actual army. Can we have automatic formation spread? Is there a case I want all my army in middle column or I need to click everytime to spread.
5. In republic, you change leaders so often, that family mechanics dont matter. I got all my children better education,  not sure where they ended up :D
6. SO MANY NOTIFICATIONS. I know my nobles want coffee in 1334, but I dont need to be reminded for next 500 years about that
7. Big purple events have little to no impact. There was some Italian wars, some states entered and left coalitions, nobody ever declared war.... and it ended in few years.
8. Fleets needs some tag for their purpose. Fighting/Transport/Logistics. AND FORBID THEM TO DO ANYTHING ELSE. I want my transport fleet move troops and once you are done, go to port. I dont want my recently War Galeon to participate in transport and be killed as soon as it leaves the port.
9. Vassal options/focus. What I remember, in EUIV, your vassals could specialize, one could do army, one could economy and so on. Wish it was there
10. More interesting small events would be nice. You just click -7 stability every one in a while. Or take whole US medical debt to finance a Jesuit College.
11. Trade is so convoluted and that I ended up automating everything and using soviet 'nas mnogo' approach. More provinces, more trade buildings, more ships means number go up.
12. UI still needs work.

**Here's what their decades of data shows:**

📊 Temperature sweet spots:

\- Peak coffee sales happen at 45-55°F

\- Below 32°F: hot coffee demand surges significantly

\- Above 75°F: iced coffee takes over, but overall foot traffic drops



☔ Rain creates interesting patterns:

💨 Humidity matters:

\- High humidity increases cold brew preference even at moderate temps

\- How much inventory to order

\- Whether to promote hot vs. cold drinks

\- When to stock up vs. reduce perishables

Location-specific weather favorability forecasts for coffee shops. Simple one-word guidance each week: ""Favorable,"" ""Unfavorable,"" ""Unfavorably Hot,"" or ""Mixed.""

$1/week per location. That's it.

**But here's where I need YOUR expertise:**

We have this live right now, but I want to know what ELSE would actually help you:

1️⃣ **What weather insights would change your daily decisions?**

2️⃣ **What do you wish you knew about the week ahead?** (temperature trends, precipitation, humidity, wind, specific product recommendations?)

3️⃣ **How far in advance do you need forecasts?** (3 days? 7 days? 14 days?)

4️⃣ **What's your biggest weather-related pain point right now?** (staffing? inventory waste? promotion timing?)

5️⃣ **Beyond the weekly forecast, what other weather data would be worth paying for?**



**For the data nerds:**

What weather-related patterns have you noticed in your own sales? Any correlations that surprised you? We're trying to figure out what additional insights would actually be actionable vs. just interesting.

Your feedback will literally shape what we build next.

Am I wrong for even tweaking out about him even though he played me so bad its no wonder he used to be a football PLAYER?,"What do I even type so I don’t absolutely go batshit crazy? I love that man. I love passion projects. I love giving people with questionable intentions and actions space in my life. I think I was such a good rebound for my ex. It felt like a situationship with a million expectations, not a relationship.

Let me see. I miss, I guess, being treated like shit. I must be a masochist to an extent. This is such a load of bullshit. I guess I just feel so upset about all the investment I made in someone so mediocre. Ambition, friendships, family, habits, hygiene, effort, priorities. Everything was mediocre.

He portrayed himself as such a good person, a wolf in sheep’s clothing. And I’m so mad because he put a lot of effort into getting back into contact with me. Why couldn’t you put that effort into keeping me, into communicating with me about your financial struggles instead of shaming me for being a pre med student? Why? I want to be a doctor.

Why could you appreciate everything I did for you, ordering you campus treats, coffees, plans, groceries, but not appreciate me remembering your favorite gummies and bringing them, especially after what happened to your brother? Why couldn’t you see supporting me financially to a certain extent not as a liability or a nuisance, but as an investment, if you swore you wanted a future?

Why couldn’t you be a good man? Why did you have to act like a mediocre boy? All in all, why did you love drinking and getting drunk with your friends more than me? Why did you tell yourself I would never leave and let your actions show that you truly believed that?",0,1766499713.0,amiwrong,7,0.5,False

We’ve known each other for about a month through a group of mutual friends (I’m 33, he’s 34).

We first met at a group hangout and barely talked. Later we chatted for a couple of days, and since it flowed, he suggested meeting up for coffee to talk in person rather than text. I had exams, so we didn’t plan anything right away and didn’t really stay in touch by text.

We saw each other again at another group hangout, said hi and bye, and about a week later had our first one-on-one hangout. It felt easy and natural, just talking and walking. Nothing physical happened besides a friendly hug. The next day, he texted saying he felt comfortable with me, found me gorgeous, and wanted to see me again. We then planned to go to the theater. He suggested coffee before or dinner after, and since it was a Friday I said I could stay for dinner. He mentioned either finding a place to eat or having me over to cook. I told him I prefer to get to know someone slowly, and he was very respectful, thanked me for being honest, and said he’d look for a restaurant instead.

Between “dates,” we don’t text at all, no daily chatting. Most of our interaction happens in person. **Is that normal?** I actually don’t mind not texting; it makes me anxious and feel attached before really getting to know someone.

So my question is: **does this sound more like friendship or romantic interest?**  
And if a guy invites you to dinner at his place this early on, does it usually mean he expects to hook up? It feels like a big jump in intimacy since we’ve barely had physical contact. I like him, but I want to go slow and don’t want to assume anything. No red flags, just looking for outside perspectives.",1,1766499620.0,dating_advice,7,1.0,False

I immediately blotted with a sponge and ice cold water. I texted the host within 5 minutes. There’s no accessible cleaning products available in the house.

Is there anything else I can do? I felt owning up ASAP was the best move in case the host lives close by. As the water is drying I may have been quick enough to prevent a stain but won’t know for sure until later.",3,1766499588.0,airbnb_hosts,14,0.71,False
