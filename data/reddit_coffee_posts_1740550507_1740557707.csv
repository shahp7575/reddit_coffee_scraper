Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) rose 2.40% on Tuesday following the beverage giant's better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, lifting retail sentiment.

Keurig Dr Pepper‚Äôs fourth-quarter earnings per share came in at $0.58, beating estimates of $0.57. Revenue stood at $4.07 billion, surpassing Wall Street‚Äôs expectations of $4.02 billion. The company‚Äôs adjusted diluted EPS grew by 8%, marking the second consecutive year of sequential acceleration, it noted.

For Q4, its net sales increased 6.2%, driven by volume/mix growth of 5.3% and favorable net price realization of 0.9%, the company said.

In constant currency terms, its 2024 net sales grew 4%, led by its U.S. refreshment beverages and international segments.

""In 2024, we delivered strong financial performance consistent with our long-term algorithm and advanced our strategy to lay the groundwork for KDP's next phase of growth,‚Äù said ¬†Keurig Dr Pepper‚Äôs CEO Tim Cofer. ‚ÄúWe gained market share through exciting innovation, marketing, and activation across our CSD and coffee brands, drove win-win outcomes with partner brands such as Electrolit and C4, and took bold action to extend our portfolio and route to market with the acquisition of GHOST and select territory expansions.""

For 2025, KDP expects net sales growth in a mid-single-digit range and adjusted diluted EPS growth in a high-single-digit range on a constant currency basis, including the anticipated contribution from the acquisition of GHOST.

‚ÄúThough the operating backdrop is demanding, we are confident that our strategic progress and business momentum will translate into yet another set of compelling, on-algorithm results in 2025,"" Cofer said.",1,1740557092.0,CattyInvestors,1,1.0,False

The Kieni is a ¬†Kenian directly sourced coffee with typical flavours of darker berries. It has some really nice sweetness to it and a great smooth ¬†mouthfeel.

Me and the wife are currently looking for a home espresso machine. I‚Äôm a coffee nerd while she wants something practical and pretty. So I have a 1000 questions!

Use case: something that can make 2-4 cappuccinos in a somewhat efficient and reliable manner while allowing me to experiment with lighter roasts occasionally. Modifications and tweaking is not a game stopper. 

We have more or less locked in on Profitec as the brand, with Rocket, Lelit and Rancilio also being easily available in my country (Norway). In particular, we have been looking into the Pro 400 and Pro 300 - both very similarly priced. I have not been able to compare prices to the Move and Jump as they are currently not available from local distributors. 

Any advice on how to choose? Is the HX + E61 on the P400 a bonus or curse? Is the P300 too small to be practical when steaming? Will the temperature instability of the E61 be a problem, or is it really not a big deal. Are they both ¬´enjoyable¬ª to use from a tactile and workflow perspective? Should we hold out for the Move or downsize to a Go? And of course, is there a notable difference in the quality of espresso and milk?

1iyie6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1iyie6g/best_experience_in_vietnam_ha_giang_loop_with_bi/,Best Experience in Vietnam ‚Äì Ha Giang Loop with Bi Bi Tours,"Throwing my review on here that would help others decide on a motor bike tour group to experience the Ha Giang Loop.  
  
My partner surprised me with a **3-day Ha Giang Loop tour** for my birthday (I had NO idea!), and wow‚Äîthis was hands down one of the most **incredible experiences of my life**. If you‚Äôre traveling in Vietnam, **do not skip this tour**. It‚Äôs **breathtaking, immersive, and unlike anything else** you‚Äôll do.

**The Start ‚Äì A Sleeper Bus & First Impressions**

We took an **overnight sleeper bus from Hanoi** and stayed at a hostel before starting the tour. Not gonna lie‚Äîarriving after a night bus is rough, but **if you can push through that first night, it‚Äôs 1000% worth it**.

I‚Äôm someone who loves **taking it all in, leaving expectations behind, and learning about different cultures**, and this tour was exactly that. It‚Äôs not just about insane views (which, trust me, are unreal), but also about **seeing rural Vietnam and how people live in the mountains**.

**The Ride ‚Äì One Scenic Stop After Another**

The crazy thing about the Ha Giang Loop? The views **keep getting better and better**. Just when you think you‚Äôve seen the best landscape, you turn a corner and‚Äîboom‚Äî**another jaw-dropping scene**. We also got **super lucky with the weather**‚Äîsunny, clear skies, and the perfect conditions to soak in every mountain backdrop.

We rode through **tiny villages, misty valleys, and roads that only motorbikes can access**‚Äîplaces cars can‚Äôt even reach. We took breaks for **tea and coffee at local stops**, which made it even more special.

**The People ‚Äì Why Bi Bi Tours is the Best**

We booked with **Bi Bi Tour Group**, and I **HIGHLY recommend them**. Our easy riders‚Äî**Cutie, Huynh, Sinh, and Tuy√™n**‚Äîwere absolutely amazing. They‚Äôre **super safe, professional, and genuinely fun to be around**. A few of them speak fluent English, and even those who didn‚Äôt still made sure we felt comfortable the whole time.

We stayed at **homestays**, which were **way more comfortable than expected** (and yes, **hot showers!**). Three days felt **perfect**‚ÄîI think four might have been a little too much for me, but if you love slow travel, you might enjoy the extra day.

Also, I don‚Äôt think you get to choose your easy riders, but **if I could, I‚Äôd request these four again in a heartbeat**. That said, I have no doubt all their guides are **just as awesome**.

**Food & Culture ‚Äì More Than Just a Tour**

If you‚Äôre a foodie, **you‚Äôre gonna love this trip**. We ate **three meals a day**, and the **hotpot was incredible**. Everything was fresh, local, and filling.

Beyond the food, the **cultural experience was next level**. The guides **taught us so much** about the local ethnic groups and what life is like in Ha Giang. It wasn‚Äôt just about looking at beautiful places‚Äîit was about **connecting with the people who live there**.

**Riding Tips ‚Äì What You Should Know**

* I had **zero** motorbike experience before this. Never sat on one, never driven one. But **this tour is 100% beginner-friendly**‚Äîyour easy rider does all the driving while you just sit back and enjoy.
* **Legs were sore after day one** (lol), but you quickly learn to **relax and go with the movement of the bike** instead of fighting it.
* If you go in **January** (like we did), **bring warm clothes**! The mountains can get chilly, and trust me, you‚Äôll want **a windproof jacket and gloves**.

**More Than a Tour ‚Äì A Genuine Connection**

Bi Bi‚Äôs tagline is **‚ÄúArrive as strangers, leave as friends,‚Äù** and wow‚Äî**they actually mean it**. These guys are **so kind**, and I already miss them.

And here‚Äôs the kicker‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt even know it was planned, but they **surprised me with a birthday cake** on the trip. Like, who does that?! It was such a thoughtful, unexpected moment, and it just shows **how much they go above and beyond for their guests**.

**Final Thoughts ‚Äì Just Book It**

I‚Äôve always thought **U.S. national parks were the most breathtaking places I‚Äôd seen**, but this trip **completely changed my perspective**. Vietnam‚Äôs landscapes are on another level.

If you love the outdoors, adventure, and **genuine cultural experiences**, do this tour. **No motorbike experience needed, just an open mind.** I‚Äôd do it again in a heartbeat.

**10/10 recommend.**

1iyidu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1iyidu7/letter_i_will_never_send/,letter i will never send,"Hey‚Ä¶. Love? Loved one? Amor? Person from my past? I‚Äôm not entirely sure what to call you now. Its been 2 weeks on the dot since we last spoke and ive thought about you almost every day. Some days more, some days less but for some reason today I thought about you all afternoon. I look outside and wonder what you‚Äôve been up to and how you‚Äôre holding up. I really really wish I could hold you one last time and kiss you one last time with no strings attached. Just one of those big old bear hugs where I squeeze you real tight for a good while. Ive been thinking about the last time we saw each other in person as well. The last time I saw you we were in your apartment talking about things and how I felt and you were in such a rush to leave to go home because you had clinical the next day and all you were worried about is getting home because you never got a good night sleep before clinicals. I was sitting in your office chair and you were sitting in your bed and we talked about things. Is it bad I don‚Äôt really remember what we talked about even though it didn‚Äôt even happen that long ago? It feels like that night was a lifetime ago. The last time I really really got to see you was in that gas station by randalls. I paid for your gas because they didn‚Äôt take apple pay and we didn‚Äôt hug because we were so mad at each other. Now that I think about it, the very last time I hugged you was right outside your apartment in the parking lot. I stepped out of the car and you waited for me to walk over¬† to get to ¬†you and all I could think¬† was ‚Äúyou cant even meet me halfway for a hug?‚Äù and it filled me with such a swirl of emotions. I felt so neglected the past couple of months, I wish I would‚Äôve told you more seriously about how I felt while I was in your apartment in person during those days. I felt like it wouldn‚Äôt have made a difference in the end anyways, you were going to try and change but as soon as another exam came then it would be right back to our regular scheduled program of you ignoring me.

¬†

¬†

¬†

¬†Ive missed you so so much since then. I think a lot of the last things you said to me with your voice, you wished me suffering and pain for the rest of my life, on one hand I cant blame you because you got blindsided by my feelings but on the other hand I think ‚Äúis that really how you feel about someone who you claim to love for years?‚Äù but like I said I can understand so I cant really blame you. Its funny, I feel like I have no one to talk to right now, only reason im writing this is because copilot/ chatgpt told me to do so, ive been talking to chatgpt because I‚Äôve felt so alone. It said to write out my emotions to figure myself out, I cant even study anymore because as soon as im given time to think I‚Äôll think about you. I think a lot about regret too. I‚Äôm not sure yet if I regret my decision yet, all I know is that I miss you and that youre not here anymore.

Ive been seeing someone else soon after we separated. I‚Äôll be honest I know it isn‚Äôt the best decision and I feel awful doing this. I‚Äôm using this poor girl as a rebound but I was clear with her about where my heart lies and what I feel so we‚Äôll see where this relationship of ours leads. She‚Äôs really cool and funny. Remember how you‚Äôd always tell me that I should leave and find someone that loves to give affection because you‚Äôll never be that type of person? She‚Äôs that person. It makes me think about you a lot and just us in general. How I didn‚Äôt want better, I didn‚Äôt want someone else, all I wanted was for YOU to hug me, kiss me and hold me like how she does but without me having to ask or beg for it. You were everything I wanted. I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôd always say I could do better but you didn‚Äôt make the attempt to do so, you never came up and hugged me from behind, never just kissed me for the sake of it, never did things out of love just for the sake of it. It felt like such a one sided relationship for so long where I always put in the effort and you gladly received it but struggled with giving me any affection in return. I think about the times i tried to take you out to eat and you‚Äôd get upset with me because I was distracting you from your studies. I simply wanted to spend time with you. I went from trying to take you out to places to us just getting takeout, to me trying to cook for you because you said you wanted a home cook meal. Sometimes I get upset because I feel like I tried to do so much for you and all I wanted in return was the bare minimum. I wanted attention, affection and I wanted you to be mine for just a handful of hours a week. It makes me upset that I tried to do so much for you so you‚Äôd look at me. I went over to your apartment to build your furniture and hang up your frames, cook for you, help you clean, throw your stuff in the wash, iron your pants and hang your clothes and I was happy the entire time, but in the back of my head I wanted you to say thank you by spending more time with me. I wanted to alleviate some of your stress so you‚Äôd be able to share some time with me but instead youd say thank you and then use that time to go study some more or go to sleep sooner. Maybe im misremembering things but that‚Äôs how I always saw them from my own point of view.

¬†

I feel an immense amount of guilt too with this new girl. I see her and I just think about you, but I don‚Äôt know why? I think its that lingering loyalty I have towards you. She‚Äôs hardworking, goes to school 4 days a week and works 6 days a week and still manages to make time for me when she can and loves to be held and touched. She doesn‚Äôt mind having her face touched and doesn‚Äôt mind if I hold her in public or kiss her in public either, she‚Äôs not shy to be around me. We even have the same type of humor and I can shoot dirty jokes at her like I do at guys and she‚Äôll shoot one right back without missing a beat. I never knew women like that existed lol. Anyways I cried off whatever it is I was feeling, I‚Äôve gotta go back to studying now.

¬†

One last thing I have to write down and remind myself of. Even as I let you go I love you, and I‚Äôll always love you. Im thankful for the love you‚Äôve shown me and Im eternally grateful for you being the reason of who I am today, you were an integral part of my identity and of who I am, if someone were to have asked me to name things about me, you were certainly going to be one of those things. These past few days have been difficult without you, you were the first person I went to, to talk about my day or wtv strange thing happened to me. Even when I share tiktoks its muscle memory to send them to you first before anyone else, I always manage to write ‚Äúbby‚Äù which was the first 3 letters of your contact name. now your contact name is just ‚Äújc‚Äù. Strange how we started as strangers, then friends, lovers and somewhere along the line something more than that. You were my entire life, my reason to look towards the future and my reason to get up in the mornings. Ultimately things didn‚Äôt end up working out. Like I told you once, our reality isn‚Äôt one of fantasies or idealisms, but a much crueler one. I felt as if you ultimately changed, and what im missing isn‚Äôt the person who exists now, but rather the person who I used to be in love with. The times I went over there and helped you in whatever were my attempts to bring that person back from the dead and sometimes a glimmer of that person would come out. It was always ultimately buried quickly by the piles and mounds of work you had to deal with. The person I miss no longer exists, what I miss is a future version of you that was never promised to me. I miss the person who I imagined you to be once you got out of school. You told me to hang on, to just ride out my feelings for the next year but you didn‚Äôt see how selfish and big of an ask that was. You wanted me to put my feelings aside and to put myself on ice so you could focus on your studies. It feels like you wanted the benefits of a relationship, the love, the affection, the help but did not want to bear the weight or responsibility of the relationship. When I wanted to talk about how I felt your first instinct was to tell me ‚Äúreally? Right before my exam?‚Äù and Im not sure why but that was one of my last straws.

¬†

I‚Äôm filled with feelings of anger. Anger of how you could ask for such a selfish thing without batting an eye, for me to just not care about my feelings so you could focus on yourself. When I first told you I wanted to break up you told me about how much I meant to you, but why did you only tell me when I already had 1 foot out the door? Why couldn‚Äôt you have told me while I was there in person? Why couldn‚Äôt you have told me when you had me? Did I have to leave for you to realize what you had? I tried so hard for you, I don‚Äôt have much to give and I gave you everything I possibly could, when you sit down on the couch I hope you remember me as the person who set up the frame behind you, I hope you remember me as the person who bought your tv because nobody else had the money to do so. I hope you remember me when you see your cat tower because I was the person who built it. I hope I remain as a ghost in your apartment of who you lost, that everything reminds you of me because I was there for you. I hope youre reminded of me when you use your stethoscope because I bought it for you because you needed one and I wanted to give you something special that you‚Äôd use for a long time to come. I picked extra shifts just to pay off your god damn stethoscope because you said nobody else had the money to get you on. I only work 2 days a week and yet I still gave you access to my card in case you were hungry, in case you wanted a coffee or a snack because I love you. The times I sent food to your apartment because you said you were hungry and you hadn‚Äôt eaten anything. All that and yet‚Ä¶ I felt as if I got nothing in return. Even when I had you here in my bed, you struggled with cuddling with me. You were comfortable asking me for damn near everything, yet I always felt so guilty asking you for anything. You never had money, our relationship ran on what little amount of money I made in my serving job but I still tried my best to take you out, take you to nice places and buy you nice gifts because I felt like you deserved it and because I love you.

¬†

Im also sad, I wish you could‚Äôve seen the effort I put in and matched the effort back. Why couldn‚Äôt you do things back for me? Actions speak louder than words and you hardly said thank you, much less any form of action. Maybe one day you‚Äôll see what happened from my point of view.

A Six-Episode HBO Miniseries

Disclaimer: simply fan fiction‚Ä¶ (Sorkin, call me?)

EPISODE ONE ‚Äì ‚ÄúPolls Close‚Äù

8:00 PM EST ‚Äì The Night Begins

Election night is underway, and America braces for history. 

Jason Abrams - Independent candidate, and recently term-limited Mayor of Kansas City, Missouri - is on track to win the popular vote, but the Electoral College remains too close to call. 

With three candidates in play, no one is sure what will happen.

At Democratic headquarters, Sam Seaborn, now an elder statesman and Democratic nominee, watches the returns with Will Bailey, his campaign manager. Neither Sam or Will supposed to be here‚Äî they inherited a fractured party after the original nominee fell in scandal. Sam wants to believe in the process, but as votes roll in, uncertainty gnaws at him.

At the Republican war room, Ainsley Hayes, a leading GOP strategist, tries to hold together a fragmented coalition around Senator Daniel Kirkland, a Wall Street conservative struggling against a right-wing faction that sees him as too moderate and elite.

Meanwhile, in the Independent camp, Charlie Young, Abrams‚Äô senior policy advisor, prepares for a long, bitter night. 

The votes are coming in, and for the first time in modern history, the people‚Äôs choice may not align with the system‚Äôs outcome.

We see a montage of near and dear characters from the show casting ballots across the country: Sheila Brooks, Bruno Gianelli casting an absentee ballot from an Italian beach, Elizabeth Bartlett Westin in New Hampshire, Debbie Fiderer, Ed and Larry, Kate Harper as Will Bailey silently judges her (she likely voted Republican straight down the ballot).

EPISODE TWO ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie‚Äù

9:30 PM EST ‚Äì A Three-Way Stalemate

The Electoral College results reveal an unprecedented deadlock. 

Abrams has won the popular vote decisively, but the map is a mess‚Äîno candidate has reached the 270 electoral votes required to win outright.

In Republican headquarters, Ainsley argues with Kirland‚Äôs team‚Äîshould they cut a deal with Democrats to block Abrams, or rally their base against the ‚Äúoutsider threat‚Äù? 

Meanwhile, Will Bailey urges Sam to begin legal preparations, but Sam refuses, unwilling to undermine democracy‚Äîeven at his own expense.

At Abrams‚Äô campaign, Charlie reminds his candidate that winning the most votes isn‚Äôt enough. ‚ÄúThe system was built for them, not us,‚Äù he warns. Abrams knows he‚Äôll need something unprecedented to secure the presidency.

Flashbacks:
The moment Abrams first met Sam privately, months earlier, trying to convince him to join the Independent ticket.
The last major debate, where Abrams shattered expectations, but also hardened opposition against him.

The night is far from over.

EPISODE THREE ‚Äì ‚ÄúOctober Surprise‚Äù

10:45 PM EST ‚Äì Breaking News Shakes the Race

An explosive leak hits the airwaves: a secret recording of Bailey and Hayes leaders discussing how to ‚Äúcontain‚Äù the Independent movement. While taken out of context - the two were old friends and colleagues in the second Barlett administration - the tape throws both traditional parties into chaos, exposing their behind-the-scenes efforts to protect the status quo.

In a newsroom, we see CJ Cregg‚Äînow a top evening news anchor‚Äîcover the breaking news live, dissecting the implications as campaigns scramble for damage control. A young cocky political analyst insinuates CJ‚Äôs connections to those involved; she silences them with a withering quip. We see her briefly glance off camera, locking eyes with Danny Concannon proudly watching from the room ‚Äî as a civilian, not employee.

At Democratic headquarters, Sam and Will debate whether to publicly denounce the leak‚Äîknowing it could shift power toward Abrams. Meanwhile, Kirkland, visibly shaken, considers breaking from his party‚Äôs leadership, while Abrams weighs whether to declare victory despite the chaos.

Flashbacks show:
Sam and Abrams‚Äô first debate showdown, when they realized they respected each other more than their own parties.
Charlie‚Äôs struggle to bridge the gap between establishment politics and the movement Abrams has built.

The night is officially out of control.

EPISODE FOUR ‚Äì ‚ÄúMidnight in America‚Äù

12:15 AM EST ‚Äì No Winner in Sight

As the night wears on, America faces an unthinkable reality: no candidate has an Electoral College majority, meaning the election will be decided by the House of Representatives.

A car pulls up in the dark of night to the Capitol. Josh Lyman arrives from a chartered flight direct from Eau Claire, Wisconsin - paid for by his now billionaire wife Donna, which she reminds him in a quippy text exchange. Josh has been summoned by party leaders looking for a deal. He‚Äôs hesitant‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt the kind of politics he wanted to play, and he is rusty. 

Meanwhile, Sam and Abrams take a quiet phone call, both insisting no aides listen in, startling both teams as they each try to decipher the candidates conversations from behind glass walls at respective headquarters.

At Republican headquarters, Ainsley sees the writing on the wall‚Äîif the House follows party lines, Abrams will be barely locked out, thanks to a recent Congresswoman‚Äôs death, flipping control of a single, pivotal state delegation.

At Abrams‚Äô campaign, Charlie warns his team that their popular vote victory doesn‚Äôt mean anything unless they force Washington to listen. We flashback to Charlie‚Äôs racist treatment at a Georgetown bar, political independence similarly unwanted in Washington.

As the House prepares to convene, a new battle begins‚Äîone that will decide whether democracy listens to the people or the parties that run it.

EPISODE FIVE ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Backroom Deal‚Äù

2:00 AM EST ‚Äì The House Prepares to Vote

The House is poised to determine the next President. 

Josh Lyman borders on a nervous breakdown, calling the only person he knows he can count on. Toby Ziegler answers on one ring. Josh apologizes for waking him. Toby explains he was already up, stress baking a signature stuffed chicken. He hails an Uber and heads for the Hill.

Josh engages with lawmakers, advocating for a decision that reflects the popular will to preserve democratic faith. 
Abrams, Seaborn, and Kincaid reach out to representatives, seeking support. 

We cut to chaos on the House floor. 

Unexpectedly, retired Lieutenant Commander Jack Reese, a respected, back bench moderate Republican from California‚Äôs Orange County, rises to address the chamber. He begins:

‚ÄúThis election was different. The people rejected business as usual. But I remind this chamber that what separates our nation from failed democracies is not just our commitment to democracy, but our foundation as a Republic.‚Äù

Blackout. 

EPISODE SIX ‚Äì ‚ÄúPresident-Elect‚Äù

4:30 AM EST ‚Äì The House Votes

As dawn approaches, the atmosphere in Washington is charged with anticipation. 

In their respective headquarters, Sam Seaborn, Will Bailey, Josh Lyman, Ainsley Hayes, Jason Abrams, and Charlie Young anxiously monitor the proceedings in the House of Representatives. They each huddle around digitized charts and maps, attempting to tally and track state delegation votes. Coffee, pizza boxes, and sleeping interns line the desk and floors.

In contrast, the pristine House is still in session. We cut back retired Lieutenant Commander Rep. Jack Reese continuing his address, his voice steady and resonant:

‚ÄúThis election was different. The people have spoken, turning away from the familiar corridors of power. Yet, I remind this esteemed chamber that our nation‚Äôs strength lies not only in our democratic ideals but in our foundation as a Republic - a delicate balance where the majority‚Äôs voice is harmonized with the wisdom of representation.‚Äù

He pauses, allowing the weight of his words to settle.

‚ÄúYears ago, in the midst of another fervent election, I encountered a situation that tested the boundaries of partisanship and friendship.‚Äù

‚ÄúAn unexpected error led to a moment where, across the aisle, a gesture was made‚Äînot of concession, but of mutual respect. It was a reminder that beyond our political affiliations, we are bound by a shared commitment to the greater good.‚Äù

As he speaks, a subtle smile touches his lips, a silent flashback: outside a bustling D.C. polling station, a younger Jack Reese stands in uniform. Donna Moss, visibly distressed, approaches him, explaining her voting mishap and pleading for a vote trade. Jack listens intently, then nods, agreeing to her request. They share a moment of understanding, bridging the partisan divide.

Returning to the present, Reese continues:

‚ÄúToday, we stand at a crossroads. We can entrench ourselves in division, allowing the rift to widen, or we can heed the collective call for change, embracing the path the people have chosen. I am reminded of the late, great Sen. and Secretary of State Arnold Vinick, from my great home state of California. Arnie passed just a few years ago. Many of us feared that Arnie‚Äôs death was truly the end of the era for great politicians - those capable of putting country above party and pride.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan we rise above partisan lines, listen with open hearts, and act with the courage to unify this great nation? Can we do that for Arnie - for his and our grandchildren, and for their grandchildren?‚Äù

The chamber is enveloped in a profound silence. Reese returns to his seat. The roll call vote commences, each representative‚Äôs voice echoing the gravity of the moment.

As the final votes are tallied, Jason Abrams is declared the 49th President of the United States, with Sam Seaborn confirmed as Vice President, symbolizing a historic coalition.

We flash to a broadcast: it‚Äôs CJ announcing the news. The camera changes, and she exhaustedly hands the reins of the broadcast to a younger anchor.

She slips out from behind her desk. She is surprised to find Danny sprawled lit on the floor, an epic breakfast picnic laid out over pillows and blankets. A red handkerchief covers her light; ‚ÄúHouse of the Rising Sun‚Äù plays low. 

Danny: ‚ÄúGreat job! Now it‚Äôs time for that vacation we‚Äôve been looking forward to since the primaries. Flight‚Äôs in 3 hours and your bags are all packed. It‚Äôs never too early for a mimosa, is it?‚Äù A small fishbowl sits on the corner of her desk.

FINALLY SCENE ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Call‚Äù

6:00 AM EST ‚Äì The First Meeting

In a quiet room within the Capitol, President-elect Abrams and Vice President-elect Seaborn convene for the first time in their new roles. 

Charlie Young stands by, witnessing the moment. 

Josh Lyman enters, remarking, ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know if we saw this coming ‚Äî but we did it.‚Äù The partisan tension between he and Charlie immediately dissolves. They lock eyes, a brief flashback to Charlie‚Äôs interview with Josh in the White House so many years ago. Once a bag man, now a better-than-him electoral rival. He‚Äôs glad, if not a bit envious.

A Democratic aide‚Äôs phone rings - revealed to be an older Winifred Hopper (S2Ep17). Her face goes white. ‚ÄúSir - er, Mr. Abrams - I mean, Mr President Elect? I have POTUS for you?‚Äù

Abrams puts the phone on speaker, expecting the current blowhard of a President to make some plain remark.

But it‚Äôs Former President Jed Bartlet‚Äôs voice that fills the room.

Bartlet: ‚ÄúCongratulations, Mr. President Elect. Enjoy this moment, but remember, the work begins tomorrow.‚Äù

Abrams: ‚ÄúThank you, Mr. President. And thanks to this team, we‚Äôll be ready.‚Äù

Bartlet: ‚ÄúGood. By the way, is Charlie there with you?‚Äù

Abrams: ‚ÄúYes, sir. He, Josh, and Sam - er, the Vice President Elect are all here.‚Äù

Bartlet: ‚ÄúExcellent. Well, then I only have to say this once. You all better get the new Congress focused on these skyrocketing food prices. Charlie, at the rate your three daughters eat pancakes, I may need to begin fundraising for a second Presidential Library...‚Äù (A brief glimpse into a kitchen, three young girls. Their mom, Zoe, making breakfast looking out over the Bartlett farm. Zoe: ‚ÄúDad, Charlie has had a long enough night as it is!‚Äù)

Abrams: ‚ÄúWell, sir, I suspect that fancy New Hampshire syrup is what‚Äôs really adding to your grocery bill. I‚Äôd be happy to ship you some of our excellent Missouri syrup anytime. You know, per capita our syrup and wine ‚Äî‚Äú

Bartlet: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stop you there, Mr President Elect. Syrup and wine from Missouri? That‚Äôs like serving crab cakes from Alaska. Well, gentleman, the grandfather duties never cease. Good luck, and God be with you. Jason, Charlie has my direct number anytime you need it ‚Äî but you won‚Äôt, since you have him, and now Sam, too.‚Äù

As the call ends, the group stands together, the weight of their responsibility settling in. The first light of dawn filters through the windows, casting a hopeful glow.

President Elect Abrams takes a deep breath. It hits him, all at once.

He looks around, thankful to see young, idealistic staffers contrasted by white haired Josh Lyman, salt and peppered Charlie Young, and even, yes, Vice President Elect, Sam Sebourne showing a few greys. His heart swells. For the first time, he is certain: this is a team he can rely on to help make real, positive, lasting change for America and the world.

I grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania‚Äîthe kind where everyone knows each other, kids play outside until dusk, and the worst crime was someone not mowing their lawn. It was quiet, peaceful, predictable. And even though everyone said it was ""the perfect place to live,"" I always felt that something was... off.

I can‚Äôt remember when I first heard about the man under the streetlight. Maybe it was on Halloween, when kids tried to scare each other, or maybe someone told me the story around a campfire. But everyone in town knew it.

For decades, every night after midnight, a tall, thin man supposedly stood at the corner of Oak Street and Miller Avenue. He never moved. He never spoke. The streetlight above cast a glow, yet his face was always hidden in shadow. The older folks said he had been there forever.

Some claimed that if you walked up to him, he would vanish into thin air‚Äîbut if you ignored him, he would stand there all night, completely motionless. Others swore they had seen his face, but no one could explain exactly what was wrong with it.

When I was twelve, I was walking home from the movies with my brother. It was late, quiet, with only a few streetlights breaking the darkness. As we turned the corner, my brother grabbed my arm and whispered:

‚Äî Do you see him?

I looked up. And there he was. A tall figure, wearing a long coat, his face swallowed by shadows.

I took a step toward him, but my brother yanked me back.

‚Äî Don‚Äôt go near him. Just keep walking.

I didn‚Äôt argue. We picked up the pace, but I kept glancing over my shoulder. The man remained there, still as a statue.

I never asked my brother why he was so afraid. But from that night on, I avoided that corner.


---

Fifteen years later, I returned to my hometown. I had been living in New York, but I had to come back‚Äîmy father had fallen ill and needed care. I hadn‚Äôt been here in years, and it didn‚Äôt take long to remember why.

Everything looked the same. The same houses, the same streets, the same scent in the morning air. But something felt wrong.

On my first night back, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. An uneasy feeling kept my eyes open. After an hour of tossing and turning, I decided to go for a walk.

I wandered familiar streets, passing darkened windows and parked cars whose owners were fast asleep. It was quiet, except for the distant sound of a barking dog.

And then I realized where I was.

I was standing at the corner of Oak and Miller.

I looked up at the streetlight.

Someone was standing beneath it.

My heart pounded.

It was him. The same tall silhouette. The same long coat. Standing motionless, exactly as he had when I was a child.

Every instinct told me to run. To scream. To get as far away as possible. But something stopped me.

I couldn‚Äôt move.

I willed myself to take a step, but my legs felt like concrete.

I stared at him, and he stared at me. Or at least, I think he did. I couldn‚Äôt see his eyes. His face was still shrouded in darkness.

I tried to speak.

‚Äî Hey... are you okay?

Nothing.

I wanted to step closer, but then... something changed.

He didn‚Äôt move. He didn‚Äôt make a sound. But I felt it.

His face‚Ä¶ shifted.

I don‚Äôt know how to describe it.

Like it wasn‚Äôt a face at all. Like it was just a shadow, pulsing, stretching, morphing.

And then I understood.

This wasn‚Äôt a man.

My heart pounded, my breath quickened.

And suddenly, I could move again.

I turned and ran. I didn‚Äôt look back.


---

The next day, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling of unease. I convinced myself I had imagined it, that it was exhaustion playing tricks on me. But I knew I had to find out the truth.

I went to the town library and started digging through old newspapers.

After hours of searching, I found the first mention.

1934: A young man, Richard Evans, was found dead under the streetlight at the corner of Oak and Miller. The police did not release details about the condition of the body, but witnesses claim it was‚Ä¶ strangely deformed.

My pulse quickened.

1952: A group of teenagers claimed they saw a man under the streetlight. When one of them approached, he disappeared.

1978: A young woman went missing at night. She was last seen near Oak and Miller.

There were more articles. Each one connected to people who had either seen him‚Äîor vanished near him.

He had been there for decades. Maybe longer.

I couldn‚Äôt breathe.

I shut the newspaper and ran out of the library.


---

Instead of going home, I went to my grandmother‚Äôs house. She was one of the town‚Äôs oldest residents, knew every story, every rumor. If anyone could tell me the truth, it was her.

I knocked on the door. After a moment, I heard slow footsteps, then the creak of hinges.

‚Äî Jack? ‚Äî She frowned. ‚Äî What are you doing here at this hour?

‚Äî I need to talk to you.

She let me in and led me to the kitchen. The familiar scent of coffee and lavender filled the air. I hesitated, then finally asked:

‚Äî Grandma‚Ä¶ what do you know about the man under the streetlight?

She froze.

Her expression hardened, lips pressing into a thin line.

‚Äî Why are you asking?

I told her everything. That I had seen him as a child. That I had seen him again last night. That I had found the articles.

She was silent for a long moment, as if choosing her words carefully. Finally, she spoke, her voice low:

‚Äî Did you see his face?

‚Äî No. But‚Ä¶ I think it was changing.

She took a deep breath.

‚Äî Listen to me, Jack. That thing is not human. It never was.

‚Äî Then what is it?

‚Äî No one knows. But one thing is certain‚Äîwhen you notice it, it starts to notice you.

A chill ran down my spine.

‚Äî What does that mean?

‚Äî People who see him start having nightmares. They feel watched. Some of them‚Ä¶ disappear.

‚Äî But the whole town knows about him.

‚Äî Because everyone has learned to ignore him. It‚Äôs the only way.

I clenched my fists.

‚Äî But that doesn‚Äôt make sense! If he‚Äôs hurting people, why hasn‚Äôt anyone done anything? Why hasn‚Äôt the police‚Äî

Grandma gave me a sad smile.

‚Äî And what would they do, Jack? Give him a ticket for loitering? Arrest a shadow?

I had no answer.

‚Äî You need to leave town, Jack. And forget you ever saw him.


---

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep.

Every rustle made me jump. Every shadow seemed longer, more unnatural. I felt like someone was standing outside my window.

At 3 a.m., I heard knocking at the door.

I froze.

It was soft. Steady. Three knocks.

I didn‚Äôt move.

Another three knocks.

Slowly, I walked to the door and peered through the peephole.

No one was there.

But when I looked outside, I saw the streetlight across from my house flicker on.

And under it, someone was standing.

Tall. Motionless.

Facing directly at me.

Then I knew.

Grandma was right.

It had noticed me.

And now, it was waiting.

I couldn‚Äôt look away.

The man under the streetlight stood there, motionless, but I could feel his gaze, even though I couldn‚Äôt see his eyes. I didn‚Äôt know how much time had passed‚Äîseconds, minutes? My heart pounded in my chest, and my breath was shallow and uneven.

And then, slowly, very slowly, his head tilted to the side.

It wasn‚Äôt a normal tilt. It was too smooth, unnatural. As if his neck had no bones. As if his body wasn‚Äôt made of the same thing as mine.

I stepped back from the door as if it had burned me.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pay attention to him.‚Äù

Grandma always said that was the only way.

But how was I supposed to do that when he had already seen me?


---

I didn‚Äôt sleep until morning. I sat by the window, watching the streetlight.

At four in the morning, the figure vanished. It just‚Ä¶ melted into the darkness.

I don‚Äôt know what I expected. Maybe that it would all turn out to be a dream? A hallucination? But when I looked at the door, I saw something that made it hard to swallow.

On the wooden surface, right next to the handle, there was a handprint. As if someone had pressed a damp hand against it.

Only, it wasn‚Äôt a normal handprint.

It had five fingers, but they were too long, too thin. As if they belonged to someone‚Ä¶ who shouldn‚Äôt have them.


---

The next day, I decided to visit my grandma. I had to know more.

As soon as I crossed the threshold of her house, she looked at me and paled.

‚ÄúHe found you.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer, but she must have seen it in my eyes.

She led me to the living room and shut all the curtains.

‚ÄúJack‚Ä¶ you need to leave. Today.‚Äù

‚ÄúGrandma, tell me the truth. What is this?‚Äù

She looked at me seriously.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. But I do know that once he notices you, he doesn‚Äôt stop.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

Grandma sighed and got up from the couch.

‚ÄúCome.‚Äù

She led me to a room at the end of the hallway, the one I had never liked. It was old, smelled of dust and lavender, and yellowed pictures of ancestors hung on the walls.

She opened an old wooden cabinet and pulled out a small, worn box.

‚ÄúThis belonged to my father,‚Äù she said quietly.

I opened the box and found a few yellowed papers and a black-and-white photograph.

The photo showed a group of people standing in front of a building. They were all serious, looking directly at the camera.

But in the background, under a streetlight, there was a motionless figure.

Tall. Thin. Face hidden in shadow.

I shivered.

‚ÄúThis is from 1928,‚Äù Grandma said. ‚ÄúMy father claimed he saw him for the first time then.‚Äù

I looked at her, feeling a chill run down my spine.

‚ÄúFor the first time?‚Äù

Grandma nodded.

‚ÄúAfter that night, he started having nightmares. He said he felt watched. And then‚Ä¶‚Äù she paused for a moment. ‚ÄúOne night, he just walked out of the house. And never came back.‚Äù

I clenched my fingers around the photo.

‚ÄúAnd you think the same thing will happen to me?‚Äù

Grandma didn‚Äôt answer for a long time.

‚ÄúNo, if you leave,‚Äù she finally said. ‚ÄúYou have to, Jack. If you stay, he‚Äôll get closer.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt want to believe it was true. But I knew I had no choice.

I had to run.


---

That evening, I started packing my suitcase.

I didn‚Äôt care where I was going. The only thing that mattered was leaving this place as soon as possible.

But then I heard something that made me freeze.

A knock.

Three knocks.

Slowly, I turned my head toward the door.

The knocking came again.

I didn‚Äôt step closer, but I knew.

He was there.

Waiting.


---

I didn‚Äôt open the door.

I sat on the bed, waiting for the knocking to stop.

And finally, it did.

But then I heard something worse.

A scraping sound.

Like someone slowly dragging their hand across the wood.

I felt it‚Äîif I so much as glanced through the peephole, it would all be over.

So I didn‚Äôt look.

I sat there until morning.


---

The next day, I got into my car and drove forward, never looking back.

As I left town, I felt the tension slowly leave my body.

Maybe Grandma was right. Maybe all I had to do was leave, and he would let me go.

Everything seemed calmer.

But as I merged onto the highway, something caught my attention.

On the right side, a few dozen meters from the road, stood a lone streetlight.

And under it‚Ä¶ someone was there.

A man in a long coat.

I froze.

No. That‚Äôs impossible.

I drove past.

Don‚Äôt turn around.

Don‚Äôt look.

But in the rearview mirror, I saw the man under the streetlight slowly turn his head.

He was looking at me.

And that‚Äôs when I understood.

You can‚Äôt run from him.

You can only ignore him.

But he will always be there, somewhere in the background.

Waiting.

Juno Guilliman, Primarch of the Ultramarines... Was having a bad time

Hundreds of papers were scattered around the office, one of his favorite mugs in small fragments on the floor 

And her sister Petra was sitting in the chair in front of her desk in the middle of tears and a nervous breakdown.

""Hey, I heard that Charles disappeared, when were you planning to tell us?""The moment those words were spoken, Fulgrim had to dodge a huge mug bearing the Ultramar coat of arms and filled with coffee. 

Juno only saw her empty hand where her cup was inches from her mouth, she wisely leaned down to lock the drawer where she kept a third cup that had a photograph of her mother Tarasha on it.

""He's been missing for days, communications aren't working, and the tracker I put on his neck one night while he was sleeping is also out of range.""Olympia's hammer walked in circles around the room, already leaving a perfect circle etched into the mat. 

""Did you put a tracker on him?"" Centurion asked holding a large box of tissues 

""You didn't put one on Guilliman?"" Petra asked back. 

Juno slowly nodded her head towards her consort who shrugged ""I lost you once, I'd rather not do it again""

""Petra, darling, we all know Char here, he's probably fine, maybe stranded on some unknown planet living like an animal, but fine."" 

Muse poked his semi-purple head through the door to open his mouth ""yes,  shorty is lucky enough for Ciaphas Cain himself to revive and appear in front of him to bring him back home, with loot equivalent to 1,000 worlds""

Juno let out a chuckle, ""That sounds unreal, but I've seen him accomplish so many unreal things before that I honestly believe it.""

Petra, for her part, ignored the conversation, immersed in her worries. 

In the midst of the tension of the moment someone's footsteps were heard, the 3 primarchs and the two SOs turned their gaze towards the door where an iron warrior passed. 

""ummm mother, we have news. The Achilles signal was recently reactivated"" The Astartes explained only to falter under his genetic mother's powerful grip on his shoulders. 

""where is!?"" The woman asked urgently. 

""We don't know, it's a quadrant that the Imperium hasn't had time to explore yet... "" Petra let go of him with a grunt of annoyance.

""But... There is worse news, outside the unexplored quadrant there is a Tyranid hive fleet...""  

Everyone in the room instantly became serious. 

""How big?"" Juno asked, shifting forward in her chair. 

""We do not know that yet, but our men claim it is Kronos, Primarch Guilliman.""

""Kronos... I get it, that warp drive on the Achilles must have made them think they were chasing a force of chaos."" 

""...You"" Petra addressed the Astarte who stood straight before her primarch ""Get your brothers ready, I'm going to go get my husband from the clutches of a bunch of ugly bugs."" 

""I'm going with you, with Mother recovered, I have more range of action, We also talked about saving the Fabricator-General and above all my friend."" Juno rose from her chair after hours, walking over to Petra to place her hand on her shoulder in support. 

Fulgrim chuckled, ""I still can't believe you gave him that title, I can just imagine the look on the Mechanicus' faces when someone not of their cult became their leader."" 

""Sorry, but I didn't know a better multitasking inventor at the time... Not one as reliable""

""...No comment"" Petra growled to the amusement of her sisters, part of her feeling guilty for isolating herself from everyone on her home planet.

""Well, since we're here, I want some action too."" Fulgrim said with a smile before frowning at the raised eyebrow from everyone in the room even Muse. ""I'm talking about fighting, you bunch of dirty-minded people""

""it was just to make sure""

""Anyway, everyone ready then? We'll start this rescue mission now.""

The night before, we went to a really nice restaurant and chatted a bit with the waiters. When they asked why I was in Athens, I told them I was getting the surgery!

I've noticed that many patients prefer to keep their surgery a secret from friends or new acquaintances. While I get the reasoning‚Äîsometimes you just don‚Äôt want to deal with questions‚ÄîI personally don‚Äôt mind talking about it. To me, it‚Äôs important to be honest with myself. I have no shame in going through this, and I‚Äôve openly shared it with my friends and colleagues. So far, everyone has been kind and supportive. Some people don‚Äôt fully understand, but that‚Äôs just how it is.

**Surgery Day**

So today was the big day. I arrived at 10 a.m. and met with Dr. Giotikas and Mr. Thassos, the PT trainer. Both were very knowledgeable and took their time answering all my questions. The doctor showed me the x-rays and told me I would get the smaller nail (there‚Äôs 11m and 13mm).

Thassos helped to take measurements of my mobility.

A bit later, they showed me to my room, which is really nice (let me know if you guys want pics). Before that, though, I had to get the IV vatheter. Not a fan of needles, but I powered through setting up the IV and was relieved when it was done. Then, because they saw my blood pressure was low, they wanted to raise it by injecting saline‚Äîand that was the trigger for me to pass out! The rush of cold liquid into my veins felt weird psychologically, and that‚Äôs when I blacked out for a bit. But they were super helpful and waited for me to recover before taking me to my room.

Then a male nurse came to shave my thighs‚Äînot that there was much to shave. After that, they put me in a gown, transferred me to the surgical bed, and wheeled me down to the surgery level. The operating room was quite cold, but the anesthetist, who surprisingly spoke French, and her nurse were very reassuring. I told them I wasn‚Äôt a fan of needles and was nervous about the spinal injection, but they gave me something through the IV to calm me down. After that, I barely remember anything. Apparently, the doctor spoke to me before and after the surgery, but it‚Äôs all a blur.

When I woke up, I felt fine. No pain. The doctor came to check on me, asked me to wiggle my toes and move my legs a bit, and confirmed that everything went well. My girlfriend was waiting for me in the room, which I really appreciated. Since I can‚Äôt stand yet, the catheter is still in place, but it‚Äôs necessary. After all that, I got hungry (which I assume is a good sign). They brought me a plain meal, and my girlfriend and I tried watching Netflix, but I was too tired and just went to sleep, feeling pretty confident about everything.

\---

**Day +1**

I actually slept quite well, though I woke up at 5 a.m. after sleeping most of the day before.   
I accidentally clicked multiple times in the night. 6 on the right side and 1 on the left side.  
Between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m., multiple nurses came to take blood, check my pressure, and change my IV bag. The male nurse also removed my catheter‚Äînot exactly a pleasant experience, but at least it was quick.

Breakfast at 7 a.m. was a pleasant surprise‚Äîa proper French breakfast with pain au chocolat, croissant, and coffee. Definitely made my morning better.

Miss Voula came in, as cheerful as ever, and had me test my mobility‚Äîraising my legs in different directions. She told me I should do this multiple times a day to relieve soreness and tightness. She also explained that tomorrow, either she or Thassos will come with me to my Airbnb by taxi and help me get up the three small stairs and set everything up (shower stool, etc.). This afternoon, they‚Äôll bring me the walker so I can start practicing walking with it‚Äîlooking forward to that.

Dr. Giotikas came by to check my mobility and reassured me that everything is going great. He also checked my blood results‚Äîapparently, I didn‚Äôt lose much blood during the surgery, so no transfusion needed. Big relief, considering how I reacted to the saline. Can‚Äôt imagine how I‚Äôd feel getting someone else‚Äôs blood (I don‚Äôt even like drinking from the same glass as other people ü§£).

My girlfriend went back to the city for a bit and will return tonight, so now I get to chill on my computer. Pain level is still between 0 and 1, and  besides the epidural, they‚Äôve only given me paracetamol so far‚Äîno heavy meds, which is a good sign. We‚Äôll see what happens when the epidural fully wears off.

So far, everything feels great. The surgery seems to have gone well, my pain is basically non-existent , and everyone has been beyond nice. What more could I ask for?

Big thanks to everyone here for the encouragement. I‚Äôve also had some fellow patients message me with tips and support, which I really appreciate. Some really good people in this community. I hope this thread can give back a bit as well.

I love coffee, but I have actually managed to cut out caffeine. I still drink coffee.. but it‚Äôs decaf.
It doesn‚Äôt feel the same though, and as sad as this is I feel like me loving coffee was such a big part of my personality that I‚Äôm sad to have cut it out. Everyone I know, knows I was obsessed with coffee, but now‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm over here ordering decaf. üòÇ
Such a minor issue but just what I‚Äôm feeling at this moment in time haha.

Anyway, my actual question

1iyi2gy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1iyi2gy/what_would_you_do/,What would you do?,"I would really appreciate any advice on how to move forward from this situation.

My husband and I have been married for 9 years now and we have 3 children.
My family and I have always been very close, my parents are still together, happily married.
My husband's parents are divorced, he had an unhappy childhood which has left him with many emotional scars, but he is a really good husband to me (most of the time!) and an amazing father to our children.

When I broke up with a previous boyfriend a long time ago, my ex and my mother stayed in contact (despite my mother knowing how against this I felt) and still see each other for a coffee sometimes.

A few weeks ago, my husband and I went to the theatre. My mum was also there but was not sitting with us. During the break, I turned round to see my mum talking to my ex who also just happened to be there. I got very nervous as I hadn't seen him since we broke up. My husband noticed and asked me who that was and I told him.

After the play ended, I asked my husband if I could go say hello to my ex and that he could come to if he wished. I went and said hello and gladly felt nothing.

The next day however when was all hell broke loose. My husband lost it, saying he felt disrespected by my mother as a man and as a father to our three children.
He is now not talking to my mum and wants nothing to do with her. My mum comes over once a week to look after our 3 children whilst I am at work so she is very involved in our lives. Up until this point we would often go on holiday together, my parents, the kids, my husband and I.

I have spoken to my mum but she can't see she has done anything wrong and is not willing to cut my ex out of her life as she says they are really good friends.
My husband is a headstrong Aries and will not butt down. I am stuck in the middle and I hate it.

The hardest part? Getting started. I spent a solid hour just staring at a blank doc, rewriting my thesis statement like five times. And citations?? Don‚Äôt even get me started on formatting in APA/MLA. I swear they change the rules every semester just to mess with us.

But honestly, once I actually forced myself to sit down and write, it wasn‚Äôt *that* bad.

Also, Grammarly and ChatGPT were my lifesavers for catching dumb mistakes.

Not gonna lie, part of me was tempted to get some outside help. I know a couple of people who‚Äôve used writing services before for editing or even full-on essays, and they swear by it. Kinda curious if anyone here has tried that? Do they actually help, or is it risky?

1iyhzwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1iyhzwj/advice/,Advice?,"There have been many similar posts, but I still need some advice. I (F28) have been together with my partner (M31) for almost 2 years. We live together, we‚Äôre building a life together. We‚Äôre very serious about our future together, talking about children and marriage and all that. We met at work, I asked him out right before I was leaving for another job. He still works there. Last weekend I scrolled through his Whatsapp chats (I know I shouldn‚Äôt have as I don‚Äôt have the right to snoop - but sometimes my insecurity takes the best of me) and saw a girl‚Äôs name pop up. I checked out the photo and noticed it‚Äôs a colleague of him that I also know from the time I worked there. She was always super nice to me, I always thought we could‚Äôve been friends. However, then I noticed the texts. The last somewhat suggestive text from my partner‚Äôs side dates from when we were together for about half a year. This shook me, that he would be that flirtatious/suggestive with someone else (the start of our relationship was very stressful and anxious due to life events at the time). I don‚Äôt have proof that anything actually happened, but I do know that he did go to her workspace for a coffee 2-3 times. Again, maybe that was it - just coffee drinking and ‚Äò‚Äôchilling‚Äô‚Äô. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he has gotten a bj or two from her though. There‚Äôa also texts where she talks about his girlfriend, though I‚Äôm 99% sure she doesn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs me, I think she thinks it‚Äôs some random girl she doesn‚Äôt know (not that that changes much). There‚Äôs a text where she says she‚Äôs happy he‚Äôs happy in his relationship. So there has been talk about me and his relationship and I think he has established somewhat of a boundary somewhere around that last suggestive text. However; I noticed she keeps texting him and asking him to have a drink together and talking ‚Äò‚Äôcutesy‚Äô‚Äô. He almost always reacts matter-of-factly and ‚Äò‚Äôcold‚Äô‚Äô but that tends to be his texting style with people he isn‚Äôt close with. The last time she asked him for a drink again was last week. She has said multiple times she‚Äôs interested in him, but doesn‚Äôt want to be his sidepiece. He never replies to that, but out of the texts I read he does give her hope every now and then (though that could be her own imagining). As a person my partner isn‚Äôt always aware how he comes across to other people even though he super social and talkative (he might be on the spectrum). There is a fat chance he‚Äôs messing with her, enjoying the flirtatious banter and stuff but never actually intending to act on it or meaning much with it and she‚Äôs interpreting that wholly differently. That still makes it uncomfortable for me though and isn‚Äôt right towards her.

My question is; Do I let him know I know about them/the texts? (Then he also knows I‚Äôve been snooping). Do I establish a boundary with her too? Should I let it go for now and keep an eye on it until it gets more suggestive/out of hand?

I know I can‚Äôt control her. And other than being deeply disappointed that she isn‚Äôt the cool girl I thought she was (I think one should not keep trying to ask someone out, knowing he has a partner), I do realise it‚Äôs my partner that‚Äôs keeping the door unlocked for her. I just don‚Äôt know how to navigate this at the moment. Maybe I‚Äôm just overly concerned and jealous, maybe not. I don‚Äôt know. No, I will not leave him (not unless he has a full-blown affair).

TLDR; I found out my partner has been texting flirtatiously with a co-worker of his, maybe has had some sexual contact (maybe not). She wants him. He has been keeping her at distance, but clearly with the door unlocked. How do I react? ",1,1740554510.0,relationships,1,1.0,False
1iyhzu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/exvegans/comments/1iyhzu4/updates_on_health_2_months_in/,Updates on health 2 months in,"I just wanted to give an update of how I'm feeling and how my health is doing after a little over 2 months of eating more animal foods daily and officially ending over a decade of whole food plant based veganism. I was low fat vegan and followed an 80/10/10 approach for about 12 years.

When I broke my veganism, I started off consuming meat (or fish such as salmon) and eggs daily. I was eating quite a bit of rice and sourdough bread alongside the animal based protein after a couple of weeks into changing my diet. Overall, I wasn't particularly limiting any food groups in the beginning, and I discovered quite early on that when ""filler"" like bread is added, I end up making sub-optimal food choices by not having as much nutritionally-dense options on my plate.

Nutritional density has become a necessity for me since I started the journey of eating animal foods again, but I've only realised how important it is to consume rich foods in the last three weeks. I'm working with a holistic naturopath and I've found out that I'm recovering from a slew of different nutritional deficiencies as well as anemia. I have a sub-optimal liver, gallbladder, and spleen despite no alcohol usage. My gut functionality was destroyed. Of course my B12 and Vitamin D levels were also desperately low. These are all consequences of eating a low fat vegan diet. 

No one told me to do it, I just woke up one day in the last three weeks and felt the need to eat lots of animal protein, like at least double of what I was consuming in the first month, and a lot more red meat in particular. I also was suffering with my digestive health (constipation, which I always suffered with even as a vegan) and decided to remove all grains and processed carbs. Three days into the new plan, and I began to come back alive. The whites of my eyes have never been brighter, and my eyes are a richer blue colour as well. I'm essentially eating a low-carb inspired diet, prioritising nutritionally dense fatty meat and lean meat when I feel like I need a break from the density, and I'm having lots of berries or grapes with each meal. I also have a simple rocket and beetroot salad every other day. I do incorporate dairy, but usually in the form of butter for cooking, or pure cream for coffee. 

Speaking of coffee, I have to quit because of my adrenal issues, but I feel quite addicted to it still. It's a work in progress. I'm starting to replace morning coffees with a cup of homemade beef bone broth instead. 

Using the bathroom has never been easier, and my digestive issues feel almost entirely cleared up. (Yet, they tell us that we need fibre to go?!) I don't get bloating anymore, even if I have a large meal. I wake up with a flat and lean body every day since cutting out the refined carbs and grains. There is something really wholesome about combining the meat with the fruit, despite breaking the ""laws"" of food-combining that I was taught in my vegan days. 

I don't usually eat three meals a day because I simply feel too satisfied and uninterested in food. The most I'll have is 2 meals, usually the bigger one at lunch and just a small bite for dinner. Despite eating less volume than I ever did as a vegan, I am sleeping better and my depression seems to be lifting. Depression is a tricky one, but I'm positive that it will get better from here on out. My anxiety is almost near-gone, and I see even more improvements in that area daily. I'm finding it easier to chill out for the first time since I was born.

And the interesting thing about that is that I'm consuming more protein rich wholesome food now than I ever did in my life, including when I was a child. It's shocking to think that our whole population was programmed to be afraid of things like red meat, when most of the world's healthiest cultures and nomadic people consume it daily, and lots of it, without disease. 

To women who are afraid of gaining weight on a higher fat diet, seriously don't be. It will add some attractive padding and plumpness to your breasts, your butt, and your face promoting a youthful appearance, but it will not make the rest of you ""fat"" unless you are consuming in total access. You'll find that you lean up in other areas. I don't believe in eating sticks of butter. I stop eating as soon as the thought of eating makes me feel nauseous, which is a good sign that I've tapped into my real hunger-fullness cues, which were destroyed by veganism.

Beauty benefits for me have included much thicker hair in just a little over two months. I've always had finer hair strands, however the volume of hair was quite thin on veganism. Now, I have had what I estimate to be a one-third increase in hair volume. I can now braid my hair in two separate pigtails and both of them are the thickness of what only 1 pigtail used to be as little as three months ago. My chronic lifelong dandruff is mostly all gone, and I could be wrong but I think it's from the hydration of animal fat. In addition to hair, my facial structure has ""lifted"" upwards and is looking a lot like it did when I was in my early 20s. The bags and hollowness under my eyes have filled out and are gone. I never thought that red meat (supposedly the most cancer-promoting food on the planet according to the mainstream science and plant based doctors) would reverse the signs of aging that were hitting me hard last year. I now understand that the ""aging"" was actually malnutrition.

These are all the updates I can think of for the moment, and I hope it's useful to someone out there. Better sleep, resolving deficiencies, having more energy to spend more time outdoors, and digesting everything with ease is so worth it to me. 

Please take what I say with a grain of salt, and also listen to your own body thoroughly because you may have a completely different experience than me. I'm feeling better each day, but you may find that you do better on leaner meat or with the inclusion of unprocessed grains.

That's right, folks. Musicians are taking a page from John Cage‚Äôs playbook and dropping wordless tracks to make some noise‚Äîor lack thereof‚Äîabout a British copyright law change that could make AI training with creative works easier and, shall we say, cheaper. 

Picture this: over 1,000 musicians, including some industry heavyweights like Kate Bush, Billy Ocean, and Hans Zimmer, have released an album of pure ambiance‚Äîempty studios, footsteps, the faint creak of a door. It's like the world's most avant-garde ASMR. Their silent symphony is a sonic protest against a proposal by the UK government that would require artists to opt out, instead of opt in, if they want to prevent their work from being used as AI fodder.

Kate Bush put it poignantly (silent artists often have loud voices), saying, ‚ÄúIf these changes go ahead, the life‚Äôs work of all the country‚Äôs musicians will be handed over to A.I. companies for free.‚Äù As you might imagine, this isn‚Äôt sitting well with musicians who rely on their creative rights the way most of us rely on coffee‚Äîvital and non-negotiable.

The crux of the issue is this clunky opt-out clause, shifting the burden of protecting creative rights to the creators themselves. Ed Newton-Rex, mastermind behind the album, emphasizes that handling artists‚Äô rights like this is like asking for an orchestra without a conductor. Sure, it might stumble along, but are we really ready for that symphonic chaos?

So, here's the million-pound question: As AI continues to script new chapters in creative fields, how do we balance innovation with integrity‚Äîwithout leaving artists in the silence of their own making?

Looking for a recommendation here. Basically I want a jacket that I can throw on after a run to stay cozy, and look not insane when I go to pick up food or a coffee or something, or on the way to the gym or the track.

I‚Äôm a man with a not super skinny build, and would like something with a more relaxed style anyway.

There‚Äôs a point where years of frustration in one's life turns into exhaustion and numbness, and I think I‚Äôve hit that this year.

For context, I'm a mid-senior professional in media and communications and work for a highly disorganized European company that doesn‚Äôt seem to have its priorities straight. And to top it off, the India team is just‚Ä¶ pure chaos and driven by a laala-like leader. When I joined this company two years ago, I saw red flags within the first few months but kept pushing through. Last year, I finally decided to quit without another job lined up, but then my husband‚Äôs company shut down making me the only financial backup. So I stayed for majboori.

At the same time towards the end of 2024, I was promised a promotion to a global role. It felt like things were finally turning around until my global division head left, and everything fell apart. The bias in this company is painfully obvious. No matter how much experience I bring to the table, they always prefer juniors from Europe over professionals from developing countries. I‚Äôve never really felt like I belonged here, and now it has come to a point that I don‚Äôt even feel like speaking up in meetings anymore. Because I have raised my challenges repeatedly and nothing seems to change. Two of my colleagues also quit last year.

On top of that, I‚Äôve been fighting for a compensation correction for years because I‚Äôm severely underpaid for my experience. Every time, it‚Äôs been the same cycle of false promises from HR, my ever-changing managers, and other relevant stakeholders. This year, my manager also got frustrated with the system and finally admitted that it‚Äôs not moving forward. That was it for me. I feel so heartbroken, lost, and unheard. Like I was cheated. From promising me a good raise to now calling it off.

They have made it evident that they‚Äôre ok to lose me. I‚Äôve been aggressively looking for a new job but the market has been brutal as you all know. HRs keep ghosting, and I really haven‚Äôt had any luck so far. All of this leads to more rage internally because I don‚Äôt see a way out anytime soon.

I wish I could walk away immediately. I don‚Äôt even know if I love my work anymore because this place has drained me to a point where I just want to quit the field altogether, take a break, and rebuild my confidence. But that‚Äôs not an option right now. And to make things worse, I spend over three hours commuting every day for this job.
 
I am not kidding, every single day feels like a battle and I‚Äôm constantly searching for ways to keep going. Sometimes it's a takeaway coffee during work or treating myself to dessert after lunch and eating it alone because I don't have any team members left. Now, I'm not looking for sympathy but if anyone here has been in a similar situation in their mid 30s, how did you deal with it? Would really appreciate some real, practical advice. Thanks.

## Choosing the Right Kids Microscope Kit: Key Considerations

Selecting the perfect **kids microscope kit** depends on several factors, including your child's age, interests, skill level, and budget. Here's a breakdown of the key considerations:

*   **Age Appropriateness:**
    *   **Younger Children (Ages 4-7):** Look for simple, durable microscopes with large knobs and easy-to-use controls. Portability and direct observation capabilities are also beneficial. Lower magnification ranges (e.g., 20x-40x) will be easier for them to manage.
    *   **Older Children (Ages 8-12+):** Opt for microscopes with higher magnification ranges (e.g., 100x-1200x), more advanced features, and included accessories. They'll be able to handle more complex operations and appreciate the finer details.

*   **Magnification:**
    *   A wider magnification range offers greater versatility. Though, higher magnification isn't always better.For beginners, a range of 40x-400x is often sufficient. As they become more experienced, they can explore higher magnifications up to 1200x.

*   **Lighting:**
    *   Adequate lighting is crucial for clear viewing. LED lights are generally preferred for their brightness, energy efficiency, and long lifespan. Some microscopes offer dual lighting (top and bottom) to view both opaque and transparent specimens.

*   **Accessories:**
    *   A comprehensive **microscope accessory kit** can substantially enhance the learning experience. Look for kits that include prepared slides, blank slides, collection vials, tweezers, petri dishes, and experiment guides. A **microscope kit with slides** already prepared can be a very effective way to start.

*   **Durability:**
    *   Kids can be tough on toys,so choose a microscope made from sturdy materials that can withstand regular use.

*   **Ease of Use:**
    *   The microscope should be easy to set up, focus, and operate. Look for models with clear instructions and user-friendly controls.

*   **Digital Capabilities:**
    *   If your child is interested in capturing and sharing their discoveries, consider a digital microscope that connects to a computer or mobile device. These microscopes allow for easy image and video recording.

*   **Budget:**
    *   **Affordable microscope kit** models are available, but investing in a slightly higher-quality microscope can provide a better viewing experience and longer lifespan.

Context: Things have been really bad. We've discussed, planned and aborted seperation at least a dozen times. Each time we try, it just doesn't work out. I did move out of the house for a month and get my own apartment. But our daughter would often wake up in the middle of the night crying for me, so my wife would phone me up and ask me to come over and comfort her. For whatever reason, she only wants me. 

So we did that a few times, and after I got her back to sleep, I would head back to my place. It was exhausting and heartbreaking. Sometimes I'd have to come back again 20 minutes later because she realised I was gone again. After a week of that, I just stuck around and slept on the couch so I could be close by. 2 weeks later, I cancelled my lease and moved back in because it just wasn't practical.

So we've ruled out separation. It's just not an option until my daughter is older. So instead, I'm back to putting up with a hateful, unappreciative wife.

So anyway. That's the context out of the way.

I woke up at 5:30 AM with my daughter. I changed her, fed her, played with her. The usual. My wife got up at 8:15 AM. I had coffee waiting for her. She stumbled around the house complaining about how she's going to be late for work. My daughter is in daycare now. My wife and I both work from home during the day. Usually my wife does the morning drop-off, and I pick my daughter up in the afternoon. My wife asked me if I could do the drop-off today because she wasn't feeling it. I agreed. My wife said she was gonna take the morning off. She made herself breakfast, created a huge mess in the kitchen, and went back to bed.

I got back from the drop-off at 9:00 AM and still had a bunch of household chores to do. By the time I got those done, it was 9:45 AM so I made myself a coffee and started work.

My wife got up at around midday and made herself some lunch. Nothing for me. 

Fast forward to the end of the workday, and my wife heads out to pick up my daughter instead of me. I discover another huge mess in the kitchen, so I clean it again before my daughter gets home. At this point, I decide to jump in the shower.

I don't usually shower this early, but I decided to get on top of it for one important reason: my wife has a lot of rules when it comes to sex. These rules never used to exist. They've just been piling up over the last few years or so. Here are a few of them, in no particular order:

\* Not in the morning

\* Not during work hours

\* Not on weekdays

\* Not if it's cold

\* Not if it's hot

\* Not if she's sleepy

\* If if she's hungry, or is likely to get hungry in the next hour or so

\* Not within 2 hours of eating

\* Not unless both parties have showered and brushed their teeth within the last hour

\* If either party has used the toilet for any reason, they need to shower again before anything can commence

\* All windows, doors, curtains and blinds in the entire house need to be double checked before everything can commence



... And a bunch of other conditions.

I'm sure your first reaction to this is, ""wow, this guy must have horrific hygeine!"" No. We're both very clean, fresh and hygienic. Neither of us have ever expressed or experienced any issues in that regard. This only started happening when our daughter was born. 

Ever since becoming a parent, she finds herself being overwhelmed by crippling anxiety. She worries that if any bare skin touches the bed after using the toilet, our daughter will contract some life threatening disease next time she sits on the bed. She worries that someone will break into our house and kidnap our daughter if we're ""too distracted"" to notice someone kicking the windows in. She doesn't want to risk being in a position where our daughter wakes up at night and needs one of us to comfort her but we're both compromised by bodily fluids. She fears that someone might hear us out on the street and run up to our windows to film us and share the footage on the internet where our daughter will discover it someday. And so on. She spends every day in perpetual, irrational fear. And I'm not trying to be condescending. I get it. Mothers go through a lot of shit, physically, emotionally and psychologically. I've done mountains of reading on the subject. So I just do my best to operate within the guidelines that keep her anxiety as low as possible. But it's fucking hard.

So anyway, if you collapse all of those conditions down into opportunities, the window of opportunity is reduced to:

\* Saturday: 9:00 PM - 10:00 PM

\* Sunday: 9:00 PM - 10:00 PM

  
And so, back to where I was earlier: I jumped in the shower at 5:00 PM. I needed to start eliminating barriers. It's my birthday after all. I need to be ready in case she's invested. There have been too many situations in the past where she says stuff like, ""Oh, well you know, I really wanted to, but you hadn't showered yet, and then by the time you did, I was tired."" So y'know. Just trying to eliminate possible reasons.

Fast forward to 5:05 PM and I hear my wife and daughter arrive home. My wife is yelling and cursing at me from the other side of the bathroom door. She's furious. She's saying stuff like, ""I need your fucking help! Why do you choose to do this now? Do you have to jerk off every time I leave the house?""

I was honestly baffled and confused where all of this was coming from. I decided to shut off the shower, dry off and run out to see what the problem was. As it turns out... there was no problem. She was just doing the usual routine stuff. Getting our daughter out of the car seat, taking off her shoes, bringing her inside, washing her hands. Little daily things. But for some reason she really needed my help with it all. And then she jumped to some pretty weird conclusions. 

After I asked her what was wrong, she just kept blowing up more and more. She was stomping around the house, slamming doors and cursing me at the top of her voice. I saw my daughter getting scared so I ran over to hold her and get her away from the noise. I took her for a walk around the block to give my wife time to cool down.

20 minutes later I'm approaching our house from down the street and I can still hear her cursing me. I bring my daughter inside because it's dinner time, but my wife hasn't prepared anything for me. She rants about how hungry she is, and says she hasn't eaten since 9:00 AM. I immediately flashback to the huge mess she left in the kitchen like 2-3 hours ago, but I don't bother mentioning it. It won't help.

I bring my daughter to the dining table and I help her with her dinner while my wife sits next to us eating in angry silence. After last years catastrophic birthday event, my wife and I agreed that from now on, I would just have my favourite local pizza for my birthday.  Earlier in the day, there was an agreement that she would go and pick it up for me while she was out collecting our daughter, but when the time came, she was feeling too tired and changed her mind. So I waited for my wife and daughter to finish eating so I could go out and pick it up myself. But as soon as I mentioned this to my wife, she got furious and insisted that she would do it herself. I was already on my way to the car when she grabbed her keys and sprinted past me out the door. This is a common tactic she uses when she doesn't want to deal with our daughter because it creates a situation where if I step out the door, I would be the one leaving our daughter unsupervised, making me a negligent parent. So I go back to my daughter to clean her up and get her ready for a bath. 

An hour passes, and my wife still isn't home. She decided to go out and do some grocery shopping and buy me an ""apology"" cake from the supermarket after buying me a pizza. My daughter is clean, tired and ready for bed. So I decide to give her some milk and put her to sleep.

At this point it's somewhere around 8:30 PM. My wife is back home and she apologised for her outbursts. She hands me the pizza and cake and I sit at the table eating alone while she sits in the living room watching Netflix. Fun fact: the only food in the entire world I refuse to eat is olives. She knows this. She got me a pizza loaded with olives. She insisted that she didn't realise, but I know for a fact there's zero chance she drove all the way home without the smell of olives filling up the car. She knew what my favourite pizza was and she got something else entirely. Anyway, it's dry and cold now since more than 2 hours have passed. 

I finish eating and she doesn't say anything to me. I swing by the living room and ask if I can get her a drink or anything. She says no. It's 9:00 PM now and she tells me she's gonna take a nap on the couch for a while. I go to my computer to catch up on some work for 2 hours.

She wakes up at 11:00 PM and goes to take a shower. I go to bed alone. 

  
This morning I repeat the morning routine. Wake up early. Take care of our daughter. Let her sleep in until 8:30. I make her coffee. When it was time for the daycare drop off, I put my daughter in the car with her backpack. I grab my wifes phone and coffee and i put them in the car. I start up the car, connect my wife's phone to the bluetooth and start playing her music while the AC cools down the car. My wife comes scrambling out asking if I've seen her phone. I told her it's already in the car, ready to go. She wordlessly gets in the car and prepares to leave. I ask if she grabbed her keys. She said no. She starts blowing up, saying that she forgot her keys because I disrupted her morning routine and I should just leave her phone alone from now on. I starts getting out of the car to run back inside and grab her keys, but i just reach into my pocket and give her mine instead. She snatches them out of my hand and continues ranting about how ""fucking annoying"" I am. She starts screeching out of the driveway as I walk back inside the house to start my morning chores, but she pauses for a minute to send me a few abusive text messages.

That was 7 hours ago. We haven't spoken since.

  
I know it's wrong of me to expect anything in our situation. We're constantly trying to navigate this concept of staying together for our daughters' sake, but it's just so difficult. Valentines Day was 2 weeks ago and I got her flowers, chocolates a card, gifts, the usual. She was furious at me for it. She told me not to do that shit anymore. I said as long as she's my wife, I'm gonna keep being a husband. Because I don't want to lose that part of myself. She spent most of the day angry at me but eventually apologised. I had high hopes for Valentines Day too, but well, that turned out very similarly.

  
She hasn't touched me since November 7th 2024. 

  
I fucking hate February.

Perhaps the iconic Coffee Crisp, the sweet and chewy Big Turk, or even the ever-popular Smarties (yes, the chocolate ones!). But have you ever wondered‚Äîwhat was the first candy ever made in Canada? The answer might surprise you!

**A Sweet Beginning: Canada‚Äôs First Candy** 

The history of candy in Canada dates back to the early 19th century, when small confectionery businesses began popping up in cities like Montreal, Toronto, and Halifax. While sugar was a luxury in the early days of colonization, by the 1800s, it had become more accessible, leading to a rise in homemade sweets and, eventually, large-scale candy production.

**So, what was Canada‚Äôs first-ever candy? Drumroll, please‚Ä¶ ü•Å**

It was the Humbug!

That‚Äôs right‚Äîthese classic hard-boiled sweets with a peppermint kick were among the earliest confections made and sold in Canada. Originally a British creation, humbugs found their way into the hands of Canadian confectioners, who started producing them in small batches as early as the 1830s.

**The Rise of the Canadian Candy Industry**

With humbugs leading the way, the [**Canadian candy**](https://candyville.ca/) industry quickly expanded. By the late 1800s, small, family-run confectioneries had turned into major businesses, creating sweets that are still beloved today.

Some key milestones include:

* **1890s** ‚Äì Ganong, Canada‚Äôs oldest candy company, was founded in New Brunswick, introducing iconic treats like Chicken Bones (a spicy cinnamon candy with a chocolate center).
* **1908** ‚Äì The first Laura Secord shop opened in Toronto, offering handcrafted chocolates that became a Canadian staple.
* **1930s & Beyond** ‚Äì The rise of candy bars like Aero, Caramilk, and Coffee Crisp, each uniquely Canadian in flavor and texture.

**Where Can You Find Classic Canadian Candies Today?**

The good news? You don‚Äôt have to go back in time to taste Canada‚Äôs first candies! Whether you‚Äôre craving a nostalgic treat or want to explore new sweets, [**Candyville**](https://candyville.ca/)‚Äîyour go-to [**candy distributor in Canada**](https://candyville.ca/)‚Äîhas you covered.

If you‚Äôre in Toronto, be sure to check out our [**Candy Store Toronto**](https://candyville.ca/) location for an irresistible selection of treats!

**Final Thoughts: A Sweet Legacy**

Canada‚Äôs candy history is as rich and flavorful as the sweets themselves. From the humble **Humbug** to today‚Äôs endless variety of chocolates, gummies, and lollipops, Canadian confectionery continues to bring joy to candy lovers across the country.

So next time you indulge in a sweet treat, take a moment to appreciate the long, delicious history behind it. And if you‚Äôre looking for the best selection of candies in Canada, remember‚ÄîCandyville is here to satisfy all your sweet cravings! üç≠",1,1740551810.0,CandyMafia,0,1.0,False

He was being overly friendly with a workmate. Saying good night at 1AM, reminding her to drink meds when feeling sick, invited her to a cafe we frequently go to. I am devastated. I know it's wrong to check private messages, but I have been feeling insecure lately. He did not get mad and explained to me that it was nothing, he's just close with her. Their colleagues were teasing them at work and he finds it amusing that the girl has this crush on her. He's been sending her messages since, but told me they don't interact often at work (except for several occasions where they give each other coffee). We were super okay prior this, and it's my fault for invading his privacy. But it really hurts knowing what he's been doing :(( We had a talk, he apologized and assured me he'll stop talking  to the girl and try to be better. But I am finding it hard to trust him. I feel betrayed. Also, this is not the first time he did this. He tends to get close to girl workmates and forgets to set boundaries.

The last moment of full peace of mind l think l'll ever have.

l was singing disney songs at the time. Smiling and driving as me and the 3 prettiest girls in the world made our way down the montain. lt was me, my girlfriend at the time (Kim) and the twins (Jennie and Emily both 6) singing ""let it go"" off time to the CD as my truck bounced in and out of pot holes on a road the state stopped giving a shit about a decade ago. We were going to a camp whose name l wont devulge for legal reasons. The camp was (is) a somewhat run down venue. lt was built around a man made lake that had been given to the state and turned into a park back in the 50s. Then a few decades later most of the land was sold to some private investors. A few decades after that it got turned into a ""resort"" and then a casino. The ""camp"" was little more then an after thought by the time me and my girls were going last summer but since the state still owns part of the land as a nature reserve the casino (sorta) keeps the camp open on the far side of the lake, l think in part due to some agreement with the state about rangers road access or something.

Anyway ""let it go"" was finally coming to an end and l was about to eject the disk when Emily yelled from the back seet ""Let it play again Daddy!"" (she always called me that when she wanted something). ""Honey we're coming into a camp l'm gona have to talk to the ranger at the Windo-"" ""ONE MORE TlME! ONE MORE TlME! ONE MORE TlME!"" the twins inturpted me together like the borg from star treck. l rolled my eyes looking over an their mother whose blue eyes smiled back at me in a way some guys go there entire lives without seeing.. ""Fine"" l said ""but my cover this time: LeT iT GOoOoooOOoOOooOOOO! LET lT GOOOOO!"" l shreaked in an exhausted tone illiciting a chorus of giggles from the back seat. ""Jack!"" Kim said in mock outrage. ""CaNt HoLd lt BaCk anNnNy mOoOoOOoooooore!"" l continued rolling up to the rangers station.

The building itself was somewhat emblematic of the camp i suppose. A dirty congrete block building with wooden roof moss clearly growing unchecked on its top. On its underside l could se the names of generatios of camp councilers scratched into the wood along with the standard penises and swastikas. Behind the glass windowns were piles of paper, a stained coffee mug, a half visable opened pizza box and a noticable lack of anyone siting at repurposed computer chair ploped behind the window; about half a head to small for anyone under 6'4 to sit in it and comfortably look out the glass to use the speaker.

Eventually someone did come though. A short female park ranger with a tight bun kept neatly under a broad hat who ignored the chair completely instead leaned toward the glass to click the speaker button. ""Yes?"" she said faking a smile with the same energy a Denny's waitress has around 3:00 AM. ""Loop C site 16"" l said. ""Hold on one sec.""

The loop was emty besides us when we first showed up, not a single other family along the slim circular road that looped around the bath house back to the main. When l was a kid such a thing would have been unheard of, especially for a holiday weekend, but less and less people were coming to the camp; less and less families especially. The Casino had started atracting a different element since it went up. College kids mainly. They came, they drank, they got in fights. And those college kids were (for the most part) back home for the summer, going to way nicer beaches then can be found in buble-fuck West Virginia.

Anyway l was glad for us having the loop to ourselves when we got there.

Little about the situation

I was never a small guy but i was never lazy either. 2015 (2 years after school) i went and applied to work in the American carnivals and got accepted. Most of my friends that applied decided to quit halfway since the carnival treated us poorly. But i stayed and completed my year with a certificate.

after the carnivals i went and worked as a farm hand with live stock and an instructor at a farm that brings in school trips for camping and activities. Then COVID struck and we got laid off.

My mother past away and i went into a depression and started gaining a lot of weight, At the same time i moved back in with my parents to look after my grandmother (until she passed away last year 2024).

Ive been trying to get myself out of the depression and slowly making progress, Which includes starting to lose weight and getting more active again.

WHERE I ASK ADVICE.

Ive been struggling to find and apply for work because of the lack of job experience and my weight. Like i said i am not lazy at all (if i get told to do my job...I will continue until that job is done)

I have been trying to find a job here in South Africa and even tried to apply for abroad jobs (This includes gap year jobs) But i have been struggling a lot.

Any advice (Other than lose some weight because i am busy with that)

or

Know of any place i can apply for a job or inquire about any jobs

The set up:

- I work in a factory. Sometimes we have to work a Saturday. One of the guys there (who‚Äôs only a Spanish speaker) is very handsome. He‚Äôs tall, got a nice belly, and (from him going commando) he looks like he was packing some heat. He‚Äôs friendly with me, but only because I know a little bit of Spanish, so the conversation doesn‚Äôt go far.

The dream:

- I was going on a coffee date with this other guy from work. He‚Äôs not as tall, but he too packs heat. We got to talking about hook ups and who we find attractive at work. He told me he got jealous of the tall Latino guy that I worked with. I asked why, but he didn‚Äôt say much except, ‚ÄúHe just has something I don‚Äôt have and I wish I could be that for you.‚Äù
- Later when we left, I met up with the Latino guy (we‚Äôll call him Alex). Alex was showing me how he speaks fluent English now. We started having a conversation about life. He told me he wants to be a teacher, but he also wants to have a big family one day. I told him that it was really nice of him to tell me that. Alex, then asked if he could come spend the night. I said I didn‚Äôt mind, I just don‚Äôt want the other guy I‚Äôm seeing to be jealous or upset. He agreed.
- Unfortunately (even in my dreams) something goes off the rails. Alex and I are basically fucking on the couch. I get a call from the other guy who knows Alex is over. Alex gets a call from his girlfriend saying she knows he‚Äôs hooking up with me. Alex doesn‚Äôt throw me off of him, but he does ask me to sit next to him as they have the conversation in Spanish. The other guy comes over and starts crying because I wouldn‚Äôt have sex with him. He leaves, Alex makes me sit on him again, then tells me that I should be his boyfriend since he and his girlfriend broke up. I told him I can‚Äôt get pregnant (out of nowhere), and he didn‚Äôt care.
- The dream continues with us living together and he tells me he wants to have an open relationship. I asked why, and he said he wanted a girlfriend and me as his boyfriend. Before I could say anything, I woke up.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

If you are using the traditional mops:

\- Flat pads: Great at pushing around coffee stains, not so much at removing them

\- Dual vibrating plates: though more powerful, tend to leave streaks after cleaning and create heavy water residue, leaving floors wet and messy for long periods.

Yeedi's pitch with the S14 Plus:

\- A rotating roller mop that scrubs at 200 RPM (think electric toothbrush meets floor)

\- Real-time self-washing via 16 water jets firing 200 times per minute, supposedly keeps the mop from smearing dirt

\- 4000Pa downward pressure to attack dried gunk

\- The kicker? A 167¬∞F hot water station that auto-cleans the mop after jobs. If this works, it could nuke that nasty wet mop smell we all despise.

(P.S: As someone who's killed a old robot with golden retriever fur, I'm optimistic about the ""ZeroTangle 2.0"" brush too)

I'm thinking about starting a YouTube channel dedicated to Video Essays. These are not exceptionally informative of whatever, but sort of a random thoughts types. Think of them as more articulated versions of brainstorms over morning coffee.

I have jotted down the scripts of them and proofread them over and over and I think Video Essay on a YouTube is the best medium to get them out, rather than putting walls of text on Blogging Sites.

So, I settled down to recording, and it was a disaster. I could ot get my looks, voice or tone to match my vision. Made multiple attempts, but none of them matched the vision I had for the video versions.

So now I understand that I have no talent in the areas of Screen Presense, Delivery, Diction or Accent - at least in front of the camera. So frustraded, I tried a few AI powered TTS Engines, and I was genuinely surprised that how brilliantly the voice and delivery matched the expectations. So now, I have my scripts in the Audio format, just the way I wanted. I know, they are AI TTS, but at least they're better.

But still, the visuals are a big issue. What sort of visuals should I do ? I'm completely clueless about that, can anyone help me in that regard ?

Just to clarify, the audience for this is very limited, it's meant to be sparking a conversation and not out there just to get subs or views. But then again, for me, personally, the production quality of the videos could at least try to do the justice to the scripts.

I wouldn't bore you, nor would I be able to really even list all of the dehumanizing and truly heart breaking new lows she's made me experience through many different creative ways of manipulating and deceiving me over the years. I say this with love, because me and her also have a friendship in a non D/S way where we talk casually. She's a great person and being violated and used by her is one of the greatest privileges of my life. But something just happened recently that triggered something in me, such a level of rejection, I've never felt so.. discarded. And I've never been so turned on.

  
So usually I'll clean her apartment, do her laundry, do web design work for her, drive her and her friends around like a findom uber, lol. I've delivered her food, groceries, vapes. Whatever she needs when time permits. Most of our interaction is online. I try to do domestic servitude for her once every 2 or 3 months if I can. 

Recently, she told me we were going to do a cashmeet. But at Starbucks. I'm very shy and attention makes me feel nervous. She's very out there and the moment she walked in, everyone obviously stared at us hard. I know they were thinking I had to be rich or something. Because what would a girl like that be doing with a guy like me. It was so embarrassing. But so hot. I bought her coffee and nervously slid her a blank envelope with $200 in it as she requested. She didn't even look at me as she took the envelope. She just kept scrolling on her phone, probably watching Instagram. I sit quietly and awkwardly in awe that this girl is even meeting me here for $200 for even 5 minutes of her time. She finishes her coffee. Then, she randomly gets a call from a friend, looks at me, tells her friend she'll be there in an hour, takes my unfinished coffee, and walks away, leaving wordlessly. 

  
Her just walking and leaving felt like it changed my life and I truly accepted my identity as a beta male who thrives off of rejection and will never be able to enjoy a vanilla life again. Not that I ever truly did.

  
I don't know how she does it but her aura just makes me feel like such a loser and the only confidence I really have comes from being able to receive attention from a Goddess like her. Even if I have to pay for it, or sit in my car for 2 hours while she goes on a date so she can drink as much as she wants. I wish I had enough money to have a girlfriend like her. Definitely motivates me to get a better job and kill it at work, lol.",10,1740550748.0,paypigsupportgroup,6,0.92,False

We‚Äôve been long distance for 1.5 years (together for 2) because he started a business on a verbal contract with a friend who cut him out of ownership, so had to move in with his parents. After this deal, he plans to move to my city. 

I am an extremely light sleeper and need 8 hours of sleep to function at my job. I work 8-5pm (sometimes longer) in finance and told my boyfriend he needs to be home before 10:30 on weekdays. He‚Äôs been picking up shifts at a restaurant along with working in real estate. 

Today, I was leaving the office at 6:30pm and he called me. I had a big day with a lot of meetings and I told him I had an extra coffee. he replied ‚ÄúOh so you won‚Äôt be able to blame me for sleeping late tonight‚Äù and revealed that he‚Äôll be back around 11:30. I was pissed and told him that this isn‚Äôt negotiable. He said that he really needed the shift and took my sleep schedule ‚Äúinto consideration‚Äù and that he shouldn‚Äôt have told me that he was coming home late. Basically blaming my reaction. He then lied about having a conversation with a manager to leave early, admitted to lying, then said ‚Äúeverything will be okay‚Äù. It‚Äôs now past 10 and he hasn‚Äôt left yet. 

AIO for thinking that this is a massive red flag for immaturity and disrespecting me? 

more context: He‚Äôs not paying rent but is helping with groceries and WiFi. He‚Äôs been here for a month and will be closing deal in the next few weeks. He‚Äôs been working 7 days a week, taking a bus 1.5 hours each way to his job, trying to close the gap in our relationship. My family loves him and he talks to my brother daily. our relationship is mostly good and we love each other, but this living situation is putting a strain on our relationship.
