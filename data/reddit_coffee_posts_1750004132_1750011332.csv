Here's An Honest Review!,"For years, I’d been searching for *something*—anything—that could give me real, lasting energy without the inevitable crash. I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning *from the inside out*. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

*Here’s what happened…*

\>> Ready To See If Mitolyn Actually Delivers? Start Your Own 90-Day Test—Risk-Free.

**Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula**

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for *years*, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on **Mitolyn**, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached *energy* and *weight loss* as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body *produce energy more efficiently*. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s [official website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=q-nn26-fcTAmX2j5qy6eF08Nnn9WtjOULE-D0XGVH_Y2pVlFJaS-mPvMhmWuWKu9ysB2S-RbSTjmUanfFlADIegV6hWhios-1w9QPQiaJu-k2rXnsf82n6nFFGm5mmhn), I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, *no expectations, no pressure*—just 90 days of real testing.

***Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?***

I was about to find out. 

**My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review**

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

**Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins**

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, **I noticed less bloating after dinner**, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the **3PM crash** that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

**Takeaway for Month 1:** Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. **Nothing flashy—but real.**

**Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress**

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. **My cravings were practically gone**, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. **My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper.** And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

**Takeaway for Month 2:** Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

**Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health**

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, **my energy was stable from morning to night**. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). **That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.**

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. **No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health**, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

**Takeaway for Month 3:** Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.

**The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well**

Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: **cellular energy is everything.** The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.

**Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up**

The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to **fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production**, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.

One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients **Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks.** That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.

**Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization**

Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, **Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally**—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.

Translation? **Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.**

**Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity**

Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the **regeneration of mitochondrial DNA**, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.

Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that **participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores** while on a Mitolyn-style stack.

**Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects**

Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of **systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance**. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.

This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report **improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.**

**What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know**

Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the **extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around.** These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.

One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. **The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times.** I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.

Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. **If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.**

**>> Don’t Just Take My Word For It—*****Experience The Difference*****\*\* With Mitolyn For Yourself.\*\***

Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. **It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output**—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.

I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. **That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.**

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. **No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly.** **Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.**

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, **Mitolyn overdelivered.** I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.",1,1750010760.0,TheDeepEndDocumentary,1,1.0,False

# 💊 What Is Mitolyn?

Mitolyn is a dietary supplement formulated to support mitochondrial health. The brand claims it can improve cellular energy, mental clarity, and overall physical performance. It typically contains ingredients like:

* **CoQ10** – For cellular energy and heart support
* **Acetyl L-Carnitine** – Promotes energy metabolism and brain function
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – An antioxidant that helps protect cells
* **B Vitamins** – Supports energy levels and nervous system health

Sounds promising, right? But what are people actually saying?

# 🧵 Mitolyn Reviews Reddit: Real Users Speak Out

Reddit is one of the few places where you can find brutally honest opinions. When you search **“Mitolyn reviews Reddit”**, the first thing you’ll notice is that the community is pretty divided. Here’s what I gathered:

**👍 Positive Reddit Reviews**:

* **Improved focus** – Especially helpful for people dealing with brain fog or mental fatigue.
* **More energy** – Users who struggle with chronic fatigue or low motivation said Mitolyn gave them a noticeable energy boost.
* **Mood support** – A few posts suggested it helped stabilize mood or reduce anxiety.

One Redditor wrote:  
*“I’ve been using Mitolyn for about 3 weeks now, and I feel like I’m finally getting through the afternoon slump without needing more coffee. Energy feels smoother—not jittery.”*

**👎 Negative Reddit Reviews and Complaints**:

On the flip side, some users were unimpressed. Searching **“Mitolyn reviews and complaints”**, I found feedback like:

* **No noticeable effect** – A lot of people said they didn’t feel any different after using it for weeks.
* **Too expensive** – Some Reddit users felt the price point didn’t match the results.
* **Mild side effects** – A few users reported headaches or stomach discomfort after taking it.

One comment read:  
*“Honestly? Didn’t do much for me. I wanted it to help with brain fog but it was just meh. Maybe it works for others, but I’m not buying again.”*

# 🔬 Does Science Back It Up?

Looking beyond Reddit, I checked into the ingredients. Most of them have been individually studied for their effects on mitochondrial health and cognitive function:

* **CoQ10** has strong evidence for supporting heart and cell health, especially in people over 40.
* **Acetyl L-Carnitine** is often used for cognitive support and may help with mental energy.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** is a known antioxidant with some promising anti-inflammatory effects.

So, while Mitolyn’s ingredients are backed by science, whether it “works” comes down to how your body responds to the blend. That’s probably why **Mitolyn reviews** are so mixed.

# 🛒 Where Can You Buy Mitolyn?

Mitolyn is available on its official website only . Prices vary depending on the supply (monthly vs. 3-month supply), but it’s generally in the mid to high range for supplements.

⚠️ **Pro tip:** If you’re buying from third-party sellers, double-check for authenticity. Some Reddit users warned about knock-offs or expired stock on lesser-known sites.

# 📦 Shipping, Returns, and Customer Service

While looking into **Mitolyn reviews and complaints**, a few themes came up around customer service:

* **Shipping is generally fast**, especially within the U.S.
* **Customer support is responsive** according to some, but others reported difficulty getting refunds.
* **Return policy**: Some Redditors mentioned that the return window is tight, and only unopened bottles qualify.

One user said:  
*“I tried to return it after two weeks, but they said it had to be unopened. I wasn’t thrilled with that.”*

So, if you’re on the fence, it might be smart to order just one bottle and see how you react before committing to a larger supply.

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning *from the inside out*. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

*Here’s what happened…*

**Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula**

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for *years*, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on **Mitolyn**, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached *energy* and *weight loss* as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body *produce energy more efficiently*. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s [official website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=q-nn26-fcTAmX2j5qy6eF08Nnn9WtjOULE-D0XGVH_Y2pVlFJaS-mPvMhmWuWKu9ysB2S-RbSTjmUanfFlADIegV6hWhios-1w9QPQiaJu-k2rXnsf82n6nFFGm5mmhn), I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, *no expectations, no pressure*—just 90 days of real testing.

***Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?***

I was about to find out. 

**My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review**

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

**Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins**

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, **I noticed less bloating after dinner**, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the **3PM crash** that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

**Takeaway for Month 1:** Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. **Nothing flashy—but real.**

**Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress**

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. **My cravings were practically gone**, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. **My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper.** And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

**Takeaway for Month 2:** Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

**Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health**

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, **my energy was stable from morning to night**. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). **That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.**

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. **No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health**, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

**Takeaway for Month 3:** Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.

**The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well**

Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: **cellular energy is everything.** The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.

**Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up**

The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to **fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production**, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.

One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients **Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks.** That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.

**Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization**

Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, **Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally**—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.

Translation? **Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.**

**Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity**

Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the **regeneration of mitochondrial DNA**, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.

Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that **participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores** while on a Mitolyn-style stack.

**Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects**

Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of **systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance**. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.

This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report **improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.**

**What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know**

Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the **extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around.** These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.

One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. **The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times.** I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.

Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. **If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.**

**>> Don’t Just Take My Word For It—*****Experience The Difference*****\*\* With Mitolyn For Yourself.\*\***

Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. **It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output**—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.

I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. **That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.**

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. **No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly.** **Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.**

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, **Mitolyn overdelivered.** I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.",1,1750010722.0,TheDeepEndDocumentary,1,1.0,False

I tried everything you can imagine—expensive supplements, detox drinks, gym memberships, meditation apps… nothing worked long term.

I’m talking about **MITOLYN**.

And if you’re reading this right now, I want you to pay attention. Because this isn’t just another overhyped product. MITOLYN delivered real, tangible, life-changing results for me—and it might do the same for you.

# ⚡ What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is not your average health supplement. It’s a scientifically formulated mitochondrial enhancer that works at a **cellular level**. While most supplements only mask the symptoms of fatigue or brain fog, MITOLYN goes straight to the root cause—**your mitochondria**, the energy factories of your cells.

When your mitochondria are sluggish, you feel sluggish. When they’re powered up, you become unstoppable.

MITOLYN is designed to **optimize mitochondrial function**, restore natural energy, sharpen focus, and improve overall vitality—without caffeine crashes or artificial junk.

# 🔬 What Happened When I Started Taking MITOLYN

Let me walk you through my personal experience, step by step.

**Day 1-3:**  
I honestly didn’t expect much at first. I took 2 capsules with my morning water. Within a couple of hours, I felt… a little clearer. A slight lift in my brain fog. I was cautiously optimistic.

**Day 4-7:**  
This is where things got exciting. I was waking up before my alarm—**without the usual grogginess**. I didn’t crave afternoon naps or extra caffeine. I actually wanted to work. I was productive, focused, and surprisingly calm under pressure.

**Week 2:**  
My body started to feel lighter, more agile. My mental clarity was through the roof. Even my digestion improved. Friends noticed I looked “fresh” and asked if I was doing something different. The **confidence boost** that came with this transformation was priceless.

**Week 3 and beyond:**  
I became a different person. **Motivated, balanced, full of life**. The fatigue that once held me back was replaced by a flow of energy that made every day feel exciting.

MITOLYN didn’t just help me feel better—it helped me perform better.

# 💡 Why MITOLYN Works (When Other Products Fail)

I’ve taken dozens of supplements over the years. Most are filled with empty promises. But MITOLYN is **backed by real science**. Here’s what makes it stand out:

* **Zero Crash** – The energy boost is clean, consistent, and long-lasting.

# 💊 What Is Mitolyn?

Mitolyn is a dietary supplement formulated to support mitochondrial health. The brand claims it can improve cellular energy, mental clarity, and overall physical performance. It typically contains ingredients like:

* **CoQ10** – For cellular energy and heart support
* **Acetyl L-Carnitine** – Promotes energy metabolism and brain function
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – An antioxidant that helps protect cells
* **B Vitamins** – Supports energy levels and nervous system health

Sounds promising, right? But what are people actually saying?

# 🧵 Mitolyn Reviews Reddit: Real Users Speak Out

Reddit is one of the few places where you can find brutally honest opinions. When you search **“Mitolyn reviews Reddit”**, the first thing you’ll notice is that the community is pretty divided. Here’s what I gathered:

**👍 Positive Reddit Reviews**:

* **Improved focus** – Especially helpful for people dealing with brain fog or mental fatigue.
* **More energy** – Users who struggle with chronic fatigue or low motivation said Mitolyn gave them a noticeable energy boost.
* **Mood support** – A few posts suggested it helped stabilize mood or reduce anxiety.

One Redditor wrote:  
*“I’ve been using Mitolyn for about 3 weeks now, and I feel like I’m finally getting through the afternoon slump without needing more coffee. Energy feels smoother—not jittery.”*

**👎 Negative Reddit Reviews and Complaints**:

On the flip side, some users were unimpressed. Searching **“Mitolyn reviews and complaints”**, I found feedback like:

* **No noticeable effect** – A lot of people said they didn’t feel any different after using it for weeks.
* **Too expensive** – Some Reddit users felt the price point didn’t match the results.
* **Mild side effects** – A few users reported headaches or stomach discomfort after taking it.

One comment read:  
*“Honestly? Didn’t do much for me. I wanted it to help with brain fog but it was just meh. Maybe it works for others, but I’m not buying again.”*

# 🔬 Does Science Back It Up?

Looking beyond Reddit, I checked into the ingredients. Most of them have been individually studied for their effects on mitochondrial health and cognitive function:

* **CoQ10** has strong evidence for supporting heart and cell health, especially in people over 40.
* **Acetyl L-Carnitine** is often used for cognitive support and may help with mental energy.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** is a known antioxidant with some promising anti-inflammatory effects.

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued — but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.



After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I’m honestly impressed.

This isn’t just another energy pill — it’s something different, and in this review, I’ll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it’s worth considering.



What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body’s ability to create real energy at the cellular level.



That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves — from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.



What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what’s inside:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.



PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).



N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.



Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.



Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.



In other words, Mitolyn isn’t throwing random ingredients together — it’s built around a clear, science-backed strategy.



My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.



Week 1-2:

At first, I didn’t feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.



Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""



Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn’t been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.



The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I’m no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.



Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.



Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.



Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.



Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger — more vibrant and ""alive.""



Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:



Clean, research-based ingredient list



No stimulants, no crash



Noticeable improvements after consistent use



Supports both mind and body



Manufactured with high quality standards



Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens



Cons:



Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)



Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements



Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)



Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:



Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep



Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness



Want better exercise performance and recovery



Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally



Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements



However, if you’re just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn’t for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.



Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely — especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.



I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I’m fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.



Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.



Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.



✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



If you’re serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

Just give it time — think of it as building your foundation, not putting up a quick tent.

I don’t normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.



My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.



✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.



I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”



The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.



By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.



Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.



Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.



Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.



Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.



Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.



Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:



✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.



✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.



✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!



✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.



✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.



Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:



Bloating or gas



Irregular bowel movements



Leaky gut or food intolerances



Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings



Skin issues like acne or rashes



Weakened immunity



Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...



Then this product is 100% for you.



Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.



Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.



Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.



I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

# 💊 What Is Mitolyn?

Mitolyn is a dietary supplement formulated to support mitochondrial health. The brand claims it can improve cellular energy, mental clarity, and overall physical performance. It typically contains ingredients like:

* **CoQ10** – For cellular energy and heart support
* **Acetyl L-Carnitine** – Promotes energy metabolism and brain function
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – An antioxidant that helps protect cells
* **B Vitamins** – Supports energy levels and nervous system health

Sounds promising, right? But what are people actually saying?

# 🧵 Mitolyn Reviews Reddit: Real Users Speak Out

Reddit is one of the few places where you can find brutally honest opinions. When you search **“Mitolyn reviews Reddit”**, the first thing you’ll notice is that the community is pretty divided. Here’s what I gathered:

**👍 Positive Reddit Reviews**:

* **Improved focus** – Especially helpful for people dealing with brain fog or mental fatigue.
* **More energy** – Users who struggle with chronic fatigue or low motivation said Mitolyn gave them a noticeable energy boost.
* **Mood support** – A few posts suggested it helped stabilize mood or reduce anxiety.

One Redditor wrote:  
*“I’ve been using Mitolyn for about 3 weeks now, and I feel like I’m finally getting through the afternoon slump without needing more coffee. Energy feels smoother—not jittery.”*

**👎 Negative Reddit Reviews and Complaints**:

On the flip side, some users were unimpressed. Searching **“Mitolyn reviews and complaints”**, I found feedback like:

* **Too expensive** – Some Reddit users felt the price point didn’t match the results.
* **Mild side effects** – A few users reported headaches or stomach discomfort after taking it.

One comment read:  
*“Honestly? Didn’t do much for me. I wanted it to help with brain fog but it was just meh. Maybe it works for others, but I’m not buying again.”*

# 🔬 Does Science Back It Up?

Looking beyond Reddit, I checked into the ingredients. Most of them have been individually studied for their effects on mitochondrial health and cognitive function:

* **CoQ10** has strong evidence for supporting heart and cell health, especially in people over 40.
* **Acetyl L-Carnitine** is often used for cognitive support and may help with mental energy.
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** is a known antioxidant with some promising anti-inflammatory effects.

So, while Mitolyn’s ingredients are backed by science, whether it “works” comes down to how your body responds to the blend. That’s probably why **Mitolyn reviews** are so mixed.

1lc6qyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/babyloss/comments/1lc6qyg/fathers_day/,Father’s Day,"I got my boyfriend a Father’s Day gift. Nothing huge, but still honoring him because despite losing our baby girl, he is still a father. I feel like I triggered something because now he’s really sad. I mean, granted, we’ve both been devastated. Everything is still so fresh. We just lost her two weeks ago. But he was seemingly holding it together….i know he had some moments especially because we both had to go back to our routine with work and whatnot. But he’s usually the one consoling me through the heartache. 

I hope I didn’t mess up. I got him a hat that said Girl Dad and a coffee mug that said papa bear, a candle that had notes of his favorite scent and a journal and a keychain. Just small little trinkets to show him I care. I feel like I may have sent him over the edge. I feel guilty. 

I’ve been having moments myself, but lately I’ve just been numb. I still feel the pain of losing her and my body is technically still healing because I gave birth, but like I’m physically tired of crying. It just breaks my heart too bad. Not quite suppressing anything, I’m just defeated. 

But Dolly was his daughter too. IS his daughter too. If we didn’t lose her, I’d still be pregnant right now. I wouldn’t even be visiting him because I was considered high risk and couldn’t travel. Even me being here is a reminder of what we lost. But I do enjoy spending time with him….i hate seeing him like this but we are both still grieving. I just wish we could take each other’s pain away.

**Looking to optimize your health or performance with Caffeine?** This guide breaks down everything you need to know about this popular stimulant / nootropic, from its benefits and dosage to the latest research and biohacker insights.

---

## What is Caffeine?
Caffeine is a natural stimulant compound found in various plants, most notably coffee beans, tea leaves, and cacao pods. It acts primarily on the central nervous system to increase alertness and reduce fatigue.

---

## Key Potential Benefits & Uses
Based on research and biohacker experiences, **Caffeine** is often used for:

- **Improved Alertness & Focus**: Reduces feelings of tiredness and enhances vigilance and concentration.
- **Enhanced Physical Performance**: Can boost endurance, strength, and power output, particularly in aerobic activities.
- **Increased Metabolism**: May slightly increase metabolic rate and fat burning.
- **Improved Mood**: Can have a mild mood-lifting effect.
- **Mechanism**: Works by blocking adenosine, a neurotransmitter that signals relaxation and promotes sleep, thereby increasing the activity of other neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine.

---

## Scientific Evidence: What Does the Research Say?
- **Extensive research**: Numerous studies and meta-analyses consistently demonstrate Caffeine's effectiveness in improving alertness, cognitive function, and various aspects of physical performance.
- **Strength of Evidence**: Strong.

---

## How to Take Caffeine
- **Common Forms**: Coffee, Tea, Energy Drinks, Pills, Powder.
- **Typical Dosage**: Varies widely based on tolerance, but a common range is 50-400mg per day. Start with a lower dose to assess tolerance. Consult a healthcare professional.
- **Timing**: Best taken 30-60 minutes before the desired effect (e.g., in the morning, before a workout). Avoid taking it late in the day to prevent sleep disruption.

---

## Synergies & Stacking
- **Caffeine** is often stacked with L-Theanine (to smooth out the stimulant effect and improve focus), Creatine (for enhanced athletic performance), and B Vitamins (for energy metabolism).
- **Avoid Combining With**: High doses of other stimulants can increase the risk of side effects like anxiety and rapid heart rate.

---

## Potential Side Effects & Precautions
Like any supplement, **Caffeine** may cause side effects, though they are typically dose-dependent. These can include:

- **Anxiety/Nervousness**: Especially at higher doses or in sensitive individuals.
- **Sleep Disruption**: Can interfere with sleep quality and duration, particularly if consumed later in the day.
- **Increased Heart Rate or Palpitations**: More common in sensitive individuals or with high intake.
- **Digestive Upset**: Can cause stomach irritation or heartburn in some people.
- **Precautions**: Individuals with anxiety disorders, heart conditions, high blood pressure, or sleep disorders should use Caffeine with caution or avoid it. Can lead to physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms (headache, fatigue) with regular high-dose use.

---

## Choosing the Right Form & Quality
- **Form Comparison**: Effects can vary slightly depending on the source (e.g., coffee contains other compounds). Pills or powder offer precise dosing, while beverages provide hydration and other compounds.
- **Quality Tips**: Be aware of the actual caffeine content in beverages. For supplements, look for minimal additives and ensure accurate dosage labeling.

---

## Biohacker Insights & Community Experiences
- **Common Experiences**: Widely used for boosting productivity, enhancing workouts, and improving morning alertness. Pairing with L-Theanine is a popular strategy to mitigate jitters and improve focus quality. Many users note tolerance development over time.
- **Pro Tip**: Take occasional tolerance breaks (e.g., 1-2 weeks off) to maintain sensitivity and reduce dependence.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
- **Does Caffeine cause dependency?**
  - **Answer**: Yes, regular consumption, especially at higher doses, can lead to physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms upon cessation.
- **How long does the effect of Caffeine last?**
  - **Answer**: The effects typically peak within 30-60 minutes and can last for 3-5 hours, though this varies based on individual metabolism.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



With the events of last night, we called for a rest day. No activities, everyone just needed a breather to fully rest, heal, and for me to figure out what the hell was going on. I announced to the unaffected campers that due to an accident occurring last night, we would be having another rest day. Most didn’t pry, but gave me questioning looks as I left the stage. At this point, Pam became increasingly worried about her own kids, who had spent numerous hours in the areas where these events took place. Even worse, her kids became totally mute after that traumatic night, even though they weren’t there. She opted to pick up everything and leave, saying she would come back once this situation had smoothed over and her kids started acting normally again. Can’t blame her, really. 

We banned campers from going anywhere near the water, putting a rope tied between two cabins with a sign so nobody forgot. Really it was a lame attempt to stop anyone, but there was no way to fully block off the entrance. The first rest day was somewhat normal in comparison to what was to come. The affected campers mostly found a closet or secluded space to hide. Once I felt less rattled from the prior night events myself, I went to check in on them. 

Most refused to talk to me, barring themselves away from anyone to see. The campers watched nervously, unsure fully what was going on. The only two who let me look at them were Jo and Leanne. They were in the same outhouse outside of cabin green. 

“Jo? Leanne? We know you're in there”

“...”

“Please, we are getting worried about you. We just want to make sure you two are okay. Do you need anything? You can ask me anything, I promise I will try to help you” what else was I supposed to say? 

The door swung open, and the two girls were huddled in the corner of the stall. Their skin all the way up to their necks were saggy, like Hilda's. It looked like both of them had the body of an old woman, and the face of a child. Their skin sagged unnaturally, looking bruised and veiny the closer it got to their legs. Their ankles looked the worst, with near rotting blackened flesh. It looked like the flesh of someone who had recently died. 

I suppose I had a hard time stopping my facial expression, as Jo burst out into tears. 

“I promise we are trying to find someone to help you. Do you need anything? Can you tell me anything about last night?” I asked in quick succession. 

“We breached curfew” Leanne choked, before refusing to talk to me again. 

Most campers silently used the amenities, such as sitting around the fire. The camp counselors did the same thing. We should have let them in on what was going on, but I guess they were still kids in our hearts. Everyone was  just as lost as I was. I found myself in a panic again, with Bill and Marjorie trying to convince the affected campers to leave their hiding spots to eat, to me spam calling the police department in the area. 

Nothing, all calls went unanswered. Eventually, my phone line completely went dead. I tried calling other numbers, even using my cellphone, nothing. It was like we were in a dead zone for service. I begged any campers to come forward with their cellphones in case they brought theirs secretly, nobody fessed up. Or maybe they were better listeners than I thought and didn’t bring their phones at all. 

I was exhausted, so was Marjorie and Bill. It was 11pm and we all found ourselves drinking coffee and trying to discuss what to do in the admin cabin. We had been talking ourselves into circles trying to put together a rational explanation for these afflictions. I couldn’t help but to stare down at my legs, inspecting them to see if they were getting older too. 

“I’m going to watch the beach tonight” Bill declared after a moment of silence, going to stand up.

“No- no no wait. I’m just worried if you do, the light will get to you too. We are already down Pam, I can’t lose another one of you” I said weakly. Bill gave me a weird look.

“Honey, we don’t know what it is yet. It could be dangerous” Marjorie looked at Bill calmly. 

“No, I’m not having any more of these children get hurt. It won’t hurt me. You said it makes them old, right?” he looked at me

“Well, I mean it makes the skin look old. Who knows about their uh…. Insides? It could just be cosmetic, “ I said hesitantly. 

“Look at me, do you think I could get any more damn old? I can’t let them get hurt. If you need me, or get worried, I have my radio” Bill stood up, putting back on his cap and throwing his heavier flannel jacket. 

I sighed. He was right. 

Bill left the cabin with the slam of a door. Marjorie sighed along with me. 

“Hes a stubborn bag, my husband, I love him, that's my problem” she chuckled emptily. 

“I really don’t think this is a good idea” I commented

“Neither do I” 

“Should we,,,”

Silence. 

“We need to figure out this phone situation” I said firmly

“I thought you were getting Pam to call?” Marjorie asked innocently

“No, I have no phone to tell her to phone” I said more sternly than I meant to. 

“Oh, heh. Right. And you checked with the campers? No cellphones?”

“None. Or at least none wanted to give one to me” I replied

“Do you think it is an area wide blockage?” Marjorie asked 

“No clue. Thing is, the only number I have on hand is the volunteer police guys. I don’t even know how helpful they would be if we called them now. 

“Do you think… I have Bill and I’s truck. Maybe I could drive out to an RCMP detachment. I know there's one outside of Bellpoint” 

A rush of anxiety hit me for the fourth or fifth time that day. That means it would just be Bill and I until Marjorie returned. I love Bill, but Marjorie always seems to have her head more straight. But what other option was there? Cell outages can happen for kilometers in this area due to the distance away from a cell tower. It might be out for another week or two. I was running out of options. 

“Okay, yeah okay you should do that. How long will it take you?”

“Well, likely at least 5 or 6 hours one way. I could make it, maybe I could head out in a couple hours?” Marjorie replied. 

“Yeah, I guess that's what we will have to do” 



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



I stared blankly at the water in the early hours of the next morning at Bill's jacket floated lifelessly on the surface. Not only this, but several other articles of clothing floated in the lake, such as swimming suits, shirts and shorts. All kids and teen sizes. There was a harsh silence. When I tried to radio Bill this morning, it came back as no signal. It was still in his pocket. I barely remembered how I got there, but that's the next scene I remembered. My legs felt more sore than they usually did just to run there. 

I denied it at first, figuring that maybe they were fine and just threw their jackets and clothes into the water. Maybe it was a prank, a joke, a facade. My eyes twitched as I scanned the shore. No bootprints in the muddy bank, just prints walking into the water. 

My eyes peered to the left where I knew the counselors parked their cars. I already knew they fled. I heard whispers of it the day before. Trust me, I really wish I could flee right now too. They are in the lucky situation of only being here for the paycheque. This is my whole life, my home  and my income. I care for these people. And I could protect them up until now. I failed. 

I had no phone, Marjorie was gone, Bill was… and the counselors abandoned me. I walked back to camp in a daze. The wind was silent, only brushing against the tips of the trees. 

I was knocked awake when I saw the state of the remaining campers. 

Most had partially or fully wrinkled skin. Many of them sat in their normal lounging spots as they had been days before. 

It was like something was puppeting them to act like campers, while doing it all wrong. Two kids sat by an unlit firepit, staring blankly into where a fire was supposed to be. They ambiantly picked at their skin, with parts of bone starting to become visible. They wouldn’t look up at me.  Four campers stood in volleyball playing positions, completely frozen, as if waiting for the ball to come. The rest were in similar conditions all around camp. One simply sat against the wall of cabin pink, with only his ankles being sagged and worn. It was Matthew. 

I sat next to him. I felt defeated and lost, there was no hope left. I felt like I myself was walking around like a zombie. I wish I could make any of this make more sense. 

“It was like a stampede,” Matthew spoke. I quickly turned to look at him. 

“It was late at night, and something compelled everyone to run. It was primal. It woke us up from our sleep. I was trampled, I was never quick out of bed” 

“Why didn’t it wake us up?” 

“Bill tried to stop us, but there were too many. Most dived in, some walked in. Others took their time. The ones who jumped in, it was like cotton candy to water. They were gone. It was so dark” Matthew closed his eyes. 

“What… who-” I stammered

“I can’t stand the dark” Matthew curled in on himself. That was the last he spoke, despite my prying.  

Before I had time to react, two figures stood before me. I didn’t bother to look up. One had jeans and the other had a heavy coat going past his knees. 

“We need to chat, we have answers”. 



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



The signal men took me back to my cabin, and sat me down at the table where I last saw Bill and Marjorie. The men had left for 20 minutes, but were now returning. They made some small talk going in, before sitting next to me. My eyes were trained on the floor, My stress was so bad that I practically picked my finger nails off. 

“Macy, can you hear us?” the jeans one said

“Mhm” I spoke

“We got a lot to tell you, so I need you fully here with us” 

I looked up. The one in jeans was gaunt with dark brown hair. He had a patch of scruff on his face, and his shirt was nicely tucked in. The other had taken off his coat, he was on the heavier side, wore a hoodie, and was blonde. 

“Are those kids okay? Is Bill okay?” 

“We’ll get to that, for now we need to explain who we are-”

“You’re the signal men, I know that” 

The blonde one snickered at this, before the dark haired one responded

“Ah- no. We have names, That's technically our fathers. I’m Samuel and my cousin here is Henry. We have been here across from lake kiwetotam for several generations” Samuel finished

“Really?”

“Yes, our job, our life, is to keep control of the lake. It started with our grandparents, went to our fathers, then to us” 

“Keep control…?”

“Lake kiwetotam is… different from other lakes in the area. We were never given the full story for how it became how it has, but we do know it was from some creature granting it sentience Once it gained sentience, it was infused with a deep hatred of people. We theorized it learnt of the abuse humans had put its fellow kinship through, and it became a site which could beckon humans in” 

“To kill them?”

“No, to return their bodies to the earth. It uses the bodies to nourish the water and the trees. That's its goal, lake kiwetotam, to return the next generation of humans to the earth rather than to perpetuate the abuse” Samuel spoke softly. 

“But how do you-” 

“Our grandfathers tested the waters and found that human created items could affect the rate at which the lake could influence the minds of people. Specifically, man made light. The presence of a flickering spotlight, if present at least once or twice a night, would keep it at bay. This also would mean it would only need monitoring at night” Samuel continued

“We have no clue how it works,” Henry added in. 

I paused, this was a lot of information to throw at me. The lake was sentient… and was kept at bay by only this one family? How did all of this happen? Were they really telling the truth?

“But why come now? Why didn’t you tell me before I started this camp? I would have never done such a thing if I knew otherwise” I demanded. 

“You can barely believe us even after seeing it for yourself” Henry said flatly. 

“Hilda said you guys only come out at night anyways, I guess” I mumbled 

“We had to come out during the day because things are getting out of control. What matters is that several of your campers have been lured and returned to the lake. The ones who we were able to save have had parts of their psyche taken, returning them to an animalistic state. We think we can save them, but you need to trust us” Samuel finished. 

“What do you mean out of control?”

“We can keep the lake at bay for only so many years. Give me your keys” Henry demanded. 

“What! I barely know you two people, and you want to take my keys? How can I trust-” I stood up, but their eyes darted to my hands. I looked down too, causing me to cringe in disgust. My hands and legs looked more decrepit than before. Bright veins and wrinkles popped, and purple bruises and moles were galore. I sat back down, feeling dizzy. I could barely make eye contact with them. 

“I think that ends our conversation. You are in no state to help us any further, and you don’t have the capacity to understand much else” the cousins stood up, grabbing my loop of keys from my jeans.  

“What the hell does that mean?! I went into that sludge to save my campers, I still have my brain and my psyche! Don’t you dare compare me to them. Who in the world even are you people??” I screamed as they walked past me. I wanted to get up, but my legs felt too weak to move. 

“Don’t you fucking leave me?! Marjorie will be coming back any minute, she will let me out of here!”

As they walked out, heavy thumps could be heard against the door. Once I was able to get the energy to stand up, I realized the door would no longer open. They knew it couldn’t be locked from the outside. The windows were solid glass, and I watched as the campers outside were aggressively grabbed and dragged back to one single cabin by the men. There was nothing that screaming and crying could do now. 

I’m still here, laying against the wall near the window. Slowly I feel myself sinking into the floorboards as my rotting flesh begins to eat into the wood. It was pretty painful at first, but now it feels calm. I hear yelling, cursing, like a herd of angry dogs barking outside. With my one eye I can see the flashes which, even during the day, illuminate my cabin. But soon it will come to a standstill. 

Maybe it was I that angered the lake. I came here after winning all this money, all to clear out all the trees and brush, remove the animals, everything. Even worse, I brought more cabins and people here, to trample over its hairy skin. Maybe it was patient with me for years until finally, lake kiwetotam was sick of us. I had angered the spirit, and now it would reclaim me. It would reclaim all of us. I deserved this, we all deserve this. We are all going to rot. 

I want to thank everyone for coming out to camp kiwetotam this year, and I hope to see all your smiling faces in 2025.

But since my dad died, it’s like we’re walking different timelines. She checks in, she brings me dinner, asks if I’m okay, but it always feels like I’m being observed, not really felt. It’s like I’m grieving in a vacuum and she’s standing just outside of it.

The person who’s really been there for me… is Naomi (36F), my late cousin’s wife. Naomi lost her husband, my cousin Ryan, two years ago in a car accident. She and Ryan were close to my parents, and Naomi and my dad had their own bond too. After the funeral, she sent me a message, just simple: “I’m here. I know what this kind of loss does to you.”

I didn’t expect to reply. But I did. Then she messaged again the next day. And the day after that. Nothing flirty, nothing dramatic. Just these little, piercing lines that understood everything I couldn’t say out loud.

“Grief makes you feel insane, like the world’s moving without you and you’re stuck inside an echo.” “Your dad once told me that pain doesn’t go away, it just makes room in your chest until it becomes part of you. I think about that every day.”
“It’s strange, but these late night talks with you feel like the only time I’m not completely alone.”

That last one, that’s the one my wife saw. She wasn’t snooping. I’d left my phone open on the couch. She picked it up to check the weather, and the message was just… there. She read it, quietly set the phone down, and didn’t say anything for a full minute.

Then she just said, “Is this emotional or something more?” I told her the truth: “I don’t know.” She didn’t yell. She didn’t accuse. She just nodded and went upstairs. Since then, she’s been quiet. Still kind. Still making coffee in the mornings, still folding my laundry. But there’s something hollow behind her eyes. Like she’s quietly grieving too, but she won’t say what.

I don’t think I’m cheating. But I also know I’ve built a bond with Naomi that feels deeper than what I have with my wife right now. There’s nothing physical. But there’s intimacy. And I don’t know what to do with that.",3,1750010432.0,amiwrong,20,0.56,False

1lc6hrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1lc6hrh/a_call_from_god_to_his_soldiers/,A call from God to his soldiers.,"Good morning.

I want to start by telling you something plain. I'm not a preacher. I’m not a theologian. I don’t wear a collar or a robe. I haven’t been ordained by any church but I’ve been called by something far greater than any institution. I’m just a man who sees what’s happening and can’t stay silent anymore. Not because I want to make enemies but because I already have them.

Jesus said in John 15:18,

""If the world hates you, know that it hated me before it hated you.”

That’s not paranoia. That’s prophecy. And it’s unfolding in real time. We live in an age of upside-down morals and inside-out truth. And the worst part? The Church, the one place that should be roaring with clarity, is whispering. Or worse, silent. The prophets warned of this day.

Isaiah 5:20 says:

""Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.”

Does that sound familiar? We now live in a world where truth is hate speech, and lies are protected by law. Sin is not just tolerated, it’s subsidized. It’s marketed to children. It’s mandated in institutions. It’s written into the policies of school boards. And what is the Church doing?

Nothing.

Not shouting. Not repenting. Not resisting. Just complying.

God help us, we are not being persecuted into silence. We are volunteering for it. and here's the hard part: that silence? That fear? That obsession with being “nice”? That looks less and less like a dormant church… and more and more like a false one.

Galatians 1:10 asks us:

""For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ.”

So Church… who are we trying to please? Jesus wasn’t afraid to offend. In fact, He was constantly offending people. He called the religious leaders of His day “whitewashed tombs” (Matthew 23:27). He told them their father was the devil (John 8:44). He flipped over tables and drove out the moneychangers with a whip (John 2:15–17).

""Zeal for your house consumes me,” Scripture says.
So let me ask, where is our zeal? Some say, “We just need to love.”

Yes. Absolutely.

But hear me clearly, love without truth is not love. It’s deception.

Proverbs 27:6 says:

“Faithful are the wounds of a friend; profuse are the kisses of an enemy.”

Love that refuses to confront sin is betrayal. Love that won't rebuke evil is complicity. If someone’s walking toward a cliff and you say nothing because you want to “stay loving”, you’ve already failed them.

Church, we’ve confused kindness with cowardice. We’ve replaced conviction with convenience. I get it, this world is loud, fast, dangerous. It's easier to keep your head down. But I want to remind you of something: we are not the first to be pressured. The early Church was illegal. Not unpopular, illegal. They met in caves and homes. They were beaten, crucified, burned alive and they sang as they died.

And today?

We’re asked to wear a mask, or keep our sermons “inclusive,” or tone down our message for the livestream, and we fold. We shut our doors not under sword or fire, but under suggestion. During the pandemic, governments told us worship was “non-essential”, but liquor stores? Open. Wal-Mart? Wide open.

But singing hymns to the King of Kings? “Dangerous.” What did we do?

We obeyed. 

We bowed to false gods. We complied.

But here’s the Word:

Matthew 16:25 says:

""Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.”

Let that cut.

Because that’s not metaphor. That’s red-letter truth from the mouth of the lord. The modern Church has tried so hard to look wise in the eyes of the world and in doing so, it has become blind in the eyes of Heaven. We called it wisdom. We called it “loving our neighbor.” But it was fear.

Matthew 10:28 says:

""Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.”

We have feared the wrong judge. We feared the media. We feared losing followers. We feared being labeled “intolerant.” We feared confrontation. We feared cancelation. But we did not fear God.

Proverbs 9:10 says,

""The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.”

So if we’ve lost the fear of God, what wisdom do we think we have left? This isn’t just about fear. It’s about identity. We’ve forgotten who we are. We are not benchwarmers. We are not brand managers. We are not spiritual influencers. We are soldiers.

2 Timothy 2:3 says:

“You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.”

But too many Christians are living like civilians, unarmed, unaware, and unbothered. Here’s where it gets heavy: This isn’t God’s Kingdom yet. This world? It’s enemy territory. We are behind enemy lines.

1 John 5:19 says:

“The whole world lies in the power of the evil one.”

2 Corinthians 4:4 calls Satan

“the god of this world, who has blinded the minds of unbelievers.”

Even Jesus didn’t contest it. When Satan offered Him all the kingdoms of the world in Matthew 4:8–9, Jesus didn’t say, “They’re not yours.” He simply refused the bargain. He knew, for now, this world is under Satan’s rule. So why are we trying to be comfortable here? Why are we trying to blend in? Why are we trying to be liked? Why are we trying to decorate the foxhole when we’re supposed to be at war?

Philippians 3:20 says:

> “Our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.”

We are not settlers. We are soldiers. We are not supposed to be safe. We are supposed to be steadfast. and if you’re standing, truly standing, you will be opposed. You will be mocked. You will be misrepresented. You may be rejected by your own family. Jesus said so in

Luke 12:51–53:

""Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division. From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two and two against three…”

Let that sink in. Not a Hallmark Jesus. Not a smiley Sunday-school Savior. This is a King with a sword in His mouth (Revelation 1:16), a robe dipped in blood (Revelation 19:13), riding to war. This King is asking us to stop playing church and start being the Church. I’m not talking about perfect people. I’m not calling for angry mobs. I’m calling for courage. We don’t need cooler churches. We need consecrated ones. We don’t need trendier sermons. We need truth that burns through the fog. We don’t need more influencers. We need intercessors. The Church of Acts didn’t shake the world with branding. It shook the world with boldness.

""And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness.” (Acts 4:31)

When’s the last time our buildings were shaken? We can’t afford to be silent anymore. The culture is not neutral. The spirit of the age is not passive. It is devouring children, dismantling truth, redefining humanity, mocking Christ, and daring us to speak up. And too many churches have chosen silence because silence is safe. Read your Bible: God never blessed the silent majority. He moved through the faithful remnant. When Elijah stood on Mount Carmel, he said, 

“How long will you waver between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him” (1 Kings 18:21).

And what did the people do?
""They said nothing.”

That’s the same spirit today, wavering in silence while evil parades in the open. But then God answered with fire. And He’s still answering that way today. The question is, will He find an altar to fall on? Will He find a people who have cleared out the idols? Will He find a Church that still believes in power, holiness, and judgment? Or will He find smoke machines, sermonettes, and leadership seminars? God is not impressed by what we’ve built. He is not impressed by numbers. He is not impressed by lighting, branding, or platforms. He is looking for what He’s always looked for:

""These are the ones I look on with favor: Those who are humble and contrite in spirit, and who tremble at my word.” (Isaiah 66:2)

Tremble. That’s a lost word in our pulpits. The demons tremble. The early Church trembled. But today, we joke. We tweet. We entertain.
All the while, the Spirit says in 

Revelation 2:5:

""Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.”

Church our lampstand is flickering. And if we don’t burn with holy fire, we’ll be left in darkness. So here’s the invitation, and the warning. Repent. Not in a whisper. Not in private. Repent like Nineveh. Public. Corporate. Full-body repentance. From the pulpit to the pew. Rebuild the altars. Call sin what it is. Tear down the golden calves in your life, your image, your career, your comfort, your screen, your silence. And ask, honestly ask, “Have I been lukewarm?” If you have… the time for excuses is over. If you haven’t, if you’ve been standing, even alone then let this message be fuel. You’re not crazy. You’re not alone. You’re not overreacting. You’re one of the few with oil in your lamp.

Let me take a sharp turn for a moment, because we need to talk about money. Now some of you just got uncomfortable.

Good.

Because if there's one idol the Church refuses to touch, it's this one. We’ve become experts at condemning sexual sin, cultural decay, and political corruption, but when it comes to our wallets, suddenly we go quiet. Here’s the truth:

Our entire civilization is built on a sin God directly forbids. That sin is usury, the charging of interest on debt. You might think, “Well that’s just economics. It’s how mortgages and credit cards work.”
No. It’s sin. The Bible is brutally clear about it. Let’s go to the Word.

Exodus 22:25 (ESV):

“If you lend money to any of My people with you who is poor, you shall not be like a moneylender to him, and you shall not exact interest from him.”

Leviticus 25:36–37:

""Take no interest from him or profit, but fear your God, that your brother may live beside you. You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit.”

Deuteronomy 23:19:

""You shall not charge interest on loans to your brother, interest on money, interest on food, interest on anything that is lent for interest.”

Ezekiel 18:13 says the man who charges interest and takes profit:

""He shall not live! He has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon himself.”

That’s not metaphor. That’s not poetry. That’s law, judgment, and wrath. Yet today, we’ve normalized it. We baptize it with polite terms, like  “mortgage,” “line of credit,” “APR,” “business loan.”

God hasn’t changed His mind. We have built a financial empire, globally, on the systematic violation of God's law. Worse, Christians have become participants in it. We use credit cards to finance our comfort. We take out loans to chase lifestyles. We sit under teachers who preach prosperity theology, not holiness. We teach our kids to chase wealth instead of wisdom. The worst part? We blame God when the trap we walked into chains us to the floor. The Bible doesn’t just forbid charging interest it also warns about falling into debt.

Proverbs 22:7:

“The rich rules over the poor, and the borrower is slave to the lender.”

Did you catch that?

Slave. Not customer. Not partner. Slave. And some of you listening are feeling that right now. You’ve got two jobs. You can’t sleep. You’re tithing on a credit card.

You’re begging for financial peace while living in financial bondage, because nobody had the courage to tell you that the entire system is a trap. Satan built this world on slavery and never stopped. We just changed the chains from iron to interest. We made debt fashionable. We made sin structural. We let banks do what God condemns. Don’t tell me, “But that’s Old Testament law.” Jesus didn’t abolish the law. He fulfilled it. 

Matthew 5:17

When He flipped over the tables in the Temple, do you know who He went after? The money changers. The interest men. The religious racketeers. The ones profiting from sacred space.

Matthew 21:13:

“It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you make it a den of thieves.”

They weren’t just selling animals, they were exploiting the people of God. Jesus didn’t debate them. He whipped them. Where is that righteous fury now?
Because we live in a time where entire churches are built on debt. Entire ministries are funded through interest-bearing schemes. Entire Christian households are enslaved to banks, while preaching spiritual freedom. It’s hypocrisy. And we’ve all been part of it.

So let me say this plain:

If your freedom can be revoked by a bank, you’re not free. If your peace depends on a loan approval, it’s not peace. If your prosperity depends on the very system God called an abomination it’s not a blessing. It’s a curse dressed in gold. Now I’m not telling you to never take out a mortgage. I’m not saying to throw away your bank card.

But I am saying this:

If you call yourself a child of God, it’s time to ask yourself whose economy you’re really serving. Nehemiah, when he returned to rebuild the wall, discovered that his own people were charging interest to each other. And what did he do?

Nehemiah 5:7–10 (paraphrased):

“I held a great assembly and said to them: You are exacting interest, each from his brother... Let us abandon this exacting of interest. Return to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive orchards, and their houses…”

He called for repentance and restitution. We should do the same. So, I’m not just preaching against governments and schools. I’m preaching against the sin in our own hands. Usury is not freedom. It’s not progress. It’s not modern economics. It is institutionalized rebellion against God's financial design. Until we repent in our hearts and our systems we will remain servants to Pharaoh, not sons of the King. This is part of the war. This is part of the stand. This is part of the call.

The truth doesn’t just confront sex, politics, and religion, it confronts money. If the Church is afraid to preach that, then maybe it’s because the Church is on the payroll of a different kingdom.

This isn’t a sermon. It’s a trumpet. Because the war isn’t coming it’s here. The enemy is not hiding anymore. Evil is marching down the street with flags. Wickedness is printed in textbooks, enshrined in law, and plastered across our children’s screens. And instead of raising a standard, the Church has lowered the bar. This moment, demands a line in the sand.

Jesus said in Matthew 12:30:

""Whoever is not with Me is against Me, and whoever does not gather with Me scatters.”

That’s it. That’s the line. You’re either with Him, or you’re not. There is no neutral. There is no middle. There is no fence that doesn’t belong to the devil. The problem is, too many Christians have tried to live in that blurry middle ground. Tried to be “just spiritual enough, just quiet enough, just nice enough” to avoid the fight. The war has found you anyway.

Ephesians 6:12 makes it clear:

""We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.”

You may not want to fight, but you’ve been born into a battlefield. The question now is simple:

Will you stand? Or will you serve the system that hates your King?

Because this culture is not just ignoring God, it is mocking Him. blasphemy is celebrated, pride is paraded, truth is slandered.

And what’s the Church doing?

Running programs. Marketing sermon series. Hosting coffee socials and coloring inside the lines of state-approved spirituality. But I’m telling you plainly:

God is not mocked.

Galatians 6:7 says:

""Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap.”

Our harvest is upon us. We’ve sown silence, now we reap confusion. We’ve sown compromise now we reap corruption. We’ve sown comfort, now we reap cowardice.

God however still has a remnant. A people who won’t bow, won’t be bribed.
A people who, like Joshua, still say:

""As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.” (Joshua 24:15)

And if you’re still breathing, it’s not too late to be one of them. But it’s going to cost you. Because now, standing with Christ means standing against the world.

John 15:19:

""If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.”

Are you ready to be hated? Not disliked. Not debated. Hated. That’s what’s coming. If you stand for Biblical marriage... hated. If you defend unborn life... hated.
If you refuse to kneel to government idols... hated. If you call sin “sin” and truth “truth” — you will be reviled. 

Jesus said in  Luke 6:22–23:
""Blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil, on account of the Son of Man! Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven.”

Rejoice. Leap for joy. You see, we’ve forgotten something: This life is not the prize. Your reputation? Not the prize. Your job? Not the prize. Your comfort? Not the prize. The prize is Christ. The reward is eternity. The glory is His name lifted high, no matter the cost.

The early Church knew this. That’s why they could sing in chains. That’s why Stephen could pray for his murderers. That’s why Paul could write scripture from a prison floor and still call himself “more than a conqueror.”

They didn’t measure success by acceptance. They measured it by obedience. So how do we fight? Not with violence. Not with vengeance. But with absolute, immovable faithfulness.

Revelation 12:11 tells us how they overcame:

""They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.”

They overcame with blood, testimony, and courage unto death. So Church, it’s time to testify. Testify in your homes.

Testify in your schools. Testify in your workplaces, in your pulpits, and in your silence-breaking conversations. Every time you speak truth, you drive back darkness. Every time you refuse to bend the knee to falsehood, you declare the Lordship of Christ. Every time you say, “I’d rather be faithful than popular,” you shake the gates of hell.

This is the moment.

Not tomorrow. Not after the next election. Not once your kids are older. Not once you’re retired.

Now.

Joel 3:14 says:

""Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.”
We are in that valley now.

Choose.

Decide.

Stand.

We need to stop praying for safety. The early Church never did. They didn’t pray, “Lord, keep us safe from persecution.” They prayed, “Lord, make us bold in the face of it.”

Acts 4:29–30:

""Now, Lord, consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness. Stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”

And what did God do?

""After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.” (Acts 4:31)

They prayed for boldness, and they got fire. Not comfort. Not protection. Fire. Where is that fire now? We have churches on every street corner, worship albums on every platform, books in every Christian bookstore, but where is the power? Where is the trembling? Where is the transformation?
I’ll tell you where it is, it’s buried beneath a fear of sacrifice.

We want revival without repentance. We want power without obedience. We want Pentecost without the cross. But that’s not how this works.

Romans 12:1 says:

“I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God, this is your true and proper worship.”

Not offer your Sunday mornings. Not offer your Instagram bio. Not offer your quiet time. Offer your body. Your life. Your career. Your reputation. Your comfort.

That is worship.

But the modern church has turned worship into a concert and sacrifice into a suggestion. Jesus said, “Take up your cross and follow Me.”  We’ve said, “Take up your latte and follow along.”
We have a generation raised on TED Talks and therapy sermons, and they are not ready for what’s coming.

The coming storm won’t be stopped by emotional appeals. It won’t be held back by politics, negotiated with through compromise.

It will require blood.

It will require conviction.

It will require martyrs.

Revelation 6 speaks of the souls under the altar, those who had been slain for the Word of God and the testimony they maintained. 

They cry out:
""How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?” Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait a little longer… (Rev. 6:10–11)

Their sacrifice is not forgotten. Their blood is not wasted. And more will join them. This isn’t doomsday talk. This is Bible. This is the cost of being a disciple in an age of rebellion.

Jesus said in Luke 14:27:

""Whoever does not bear his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.”

Did you catch that? Not “shouldn’t be.” Not “isn’t the best version of.”

Cannot be.

You either carry the cross, or you carry nothing that matters Here’s the beautiful, paradoxical, kingdom truth: The more you lose, the more you gain. The more you die, the more alive you become. The more you’re hated for Christ, the more Heaven sings your name.

The Kingdom does not rise through the world’s methods. It rises through sacrifice. Through humility. Through fire. Do you want to see revival? Real revival? Then die to everything that holds you back.

Die to the need to be liked. 
Die to your schedule. 
Die to your fear. 
Die to your pride. 
Die to your silence. 

Then rise, like Lazarus, with fire in your lungs and gospel in your mouth. That’s what this hour demands: a resurrected, fire-baptized Church. Not better marketed. Not more seeker-friendly. Drenched in the Holy Spirit and soaked in Scripture. We don’t need another celebrity pastor. We need another John the Baptist. A wild, unapologetic,  Man of God preparing the way of the Lord in the wilderness of confusion.
We don’t need more life tips. We need a holy confrontation between light and darkness.

It starts with you.

Yes. You. 

Not just the preacher. Not just the author. Not just the revivalist. You. Every believer is a soldier. 

1 Peter 2:9

""Every saint is a soldier. Every testimony is a weapon.""

So when I say “rise,” I don’t mean in theory. I mean in your home. In your church. In your street. At your job. In your conversations. In your prayers. Rise with holy courage. Because while the enemy schemes and systems align against righteousness, God is marking His people.

Ezekiel 9:4 speaks of a mark placed on the foreheads of those who “sigh and groan over all the abominations that are committed” in the city.
He Is still looking for those people. Those who are grieved by evil. Those who haven’t made peace with sin. Those who weep over compromise, not just in the world, but in themselves.

That’s who He fills. That’s who He sends. That’s who He revives. You want to carry His presence? Then carry His burden. You want His power? Then join His war. You want His fire? Then lay yourself on the altar.

This is it.

This is not just a message. It’s a line in the sand. I’m here to tell you not everyone’s crossing it. Many won’t. Many will hear these words, nod politely, and go back to sleep. Back to their Sunday routines. Back to their lukewarm lives. Back to a faith that doesn’t cost, doesn’t change, and doesn’t save. For them, judgment begins in the house of God.

1 Peter 4:17 says:

""For it is time for judgment to begin at the household of God; and if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?”

God is not judging the world first, He is judging His people. He is cleaning His house. He is separating wheat from chaff, sheep from goats, soldiers from spectators. Revival doesn’t start in the street, it starts in the sanctuary.

And so I’m not calling on the world to repent not yet. I’m calling the Church.

Rise, remnant.

Rise from your slumber. Rise from your shame. Rise from your apathy and compromise and fear. God doesn’t need a majority. He needs a remnant. 

Noah was one man. 

Jeremiah stood alone. 

Gideon had 300. 

Jesus started with 12. 

What He needs now is a people who will burn. A people who don’t need applause. Who don’t care about labels. Who don’t fear cancellation, confrontation, or crucifixion. Because the Church was born in blood and it thrives in fire. It is not weak. It is not fragile. It is not a brand. It is a bride and the Groom is coming.

But the question remains: Will He find faith on the earth?

(Luke 18:8)

Faith that still casts out demons. Faith that still heals the sick. Faith that still believes in the power of holiness, the necessity of repentance, the truth of Hell, and the glory of Heaven. Faith that doesn’t apologize for the Gospel. Because the Gospel is not about your best life now. It’s not about self-esteem or self-fulfillment. It’s not a supplement to your goals. It’s a surrender to your King. That surrender changes everything.

You want real revival? Then let it start with you. Right now. Today. You don’t need a stadium. You don’t need a stage. You don’t need a title, a degree, or a microphone. You need a yes. A total, trembling, irreversible yes. Yes, Lord, I’ll go where You send me. Yes, Lord, I’ll say what You tell me. Yes, Lord, I’ll stand even if I stand alone. Yes, Lord I’ll burn if it brings You glory.

The world doesn’t need more relevance. It needs more righteousness. It needs to see the difference. So shine, not dimly. Shine like a city on a hill (Matthew 5:14). Shine like fire on dry grass. Shine like Stephen when the stones started flying. Shine like Paul in prison. Shine like Christ on the cross, with forgiveness in your mouth and fire in your bones.
This is the final stand.

This is the moment where God separates the ones who say, “Lord, Lord,” From the ones who cry, “Here I am, send me.”

You don’t need to be ready. You don’t need to be strong. You just need to be willing. The Spirit of the Lord is moving. He’s not looking for the popular He’s looking for the pure. He’s not seeking the qualified He qualifies the called. 

His eyes are roaming the earth, ""to and fro… seeking those whose hearts are fully committed to Him.”
(2 Chronicles 16:9)

Let Him find you. Let Him find a man, a woman, a church, a remnant that still fears God more than man. Let Him find a people who would rather lose the world than grieve the Spirit. Let Him find fire on the altar not smoke from compromise.

So I end where I began:

I’m not a preacher. I’m not ordained. But I’ve been lit up by a fire I can’t put out. And like Jeremiah said:

“His word is in my heart like a fire, a fire shut up in my bones. I am weary of holding it in; indeed, I cannot.” (Jeremiah 20:9)

Neither should you. Don’t hold it in anymore. Don’t sit on your hands. Don’t wait for permission from a system that crucified your Savior.
Speak. Stand. Burn. Rise.

This world is not waiting for more comfortable Christians. It’s waiting, groaning, for the sons and daughters of God to be revealed. (Romans 8:19)

Let that be you. Let this be your awakening.

Let today be the day you say, “I will not bow. I will not bend. I will not be silent. I belong to Christ.”

If it costs you everything?

So be it.

Because Jesus is worth it.

I'm a VERY introverted Japanese-Chinese lady in my late 40's, so I keep very few friends and I rarely socialize. 

I've lived in Richmond almost my entire life but always found it a struggle to make friendships due to language barrier and due to me being so shy and introverted. I did try to make friends here with a Richmond lady's group, but they spent 80% of the time speaking in Mandarin, so I just sat awkwardly at the luncheon for 2 hours since I'm not a full-fledged Chinese speaker. (I know 40% Cantonese and 2% Mandarin).

I would like to socialize once a month in-person, then go into hermit mode to recharge my social battery for a month till the next group meet. I don't do online chat apps nor talk on the phone, I'm old fashioned and just keep my socializing to when I meet in person. I have mild anxiety so I try to stay away from crowds, loud noises, and festivals/big events. If anyone out there is like me or understands this kind of lifestyle, I would love to have a like-minded polite lady friend or 2 or more in the Richmond or New West area! A quiet afternoon of bubble tea cafes, catching a girly movie (English or Chinese is fine as long as there are English subtitles for the Chinese films), DIY crafts activities, and spa days are what I enjoy most. My favorite places to eat are Mama's Dumpling Kitchen, Dinesty Dumpling, Memory Corner and the food courts at Aberdeen and Parker Place.

1lc6ayr,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1lc6ayr/why_more_choices_are_making_you_miserable/,WHY more choices are making you miserable,"This is embarrassing but I need to get this off my chest.

Last weekend I woke up around 10 am, feeling good. I had some writing to do, maybe catch a movie later. Perfect Saturday vibes. I grab my phone to order breakfast and... fuck.

I open my delivery app and immediately get hit with about 50 restaurants. Each one has hundreds of options. I'm scrolling thinking ""okay, healthy smoothie bowl or just say screw it and get pancakes?"" Then I see this burger place with great reviews. But wait, what if the smoothie place is better? Let me check the ratings...

30 minutes later I'm reading reviews for a $12 breakfast like I'm buying a car. ""The avocado was brown"" - one star. ""Best pancakes ever!"" - five stars. ""Took 45 minutes"" - two stars. My brain is fried.

I close the app. I'll just... skip breakfast.

Evening comes. I finished my writing (proud of myself) and decided to reward myself with a movie. Netflix time!

Oh god.

Scrolling through Netflix is like being in hell. New releases, classics, documentaries, foreign films. Each category has subcategories. I find something that looks good, but then I see it's part of a series. Do I start from season 1? What if I don't like it? What if there's something better I'm missing?

An hour later, I'm still scrolling. I'm not even reading the descriptions anymore, just mindlessly moving my thumb. I give up and turn off the TV.

But now I'm restless. Maybe I'll read a book. I look at my bookshelf - it's packed with books I bought but never read. Which one? The psychology book? The novel my friend recommended? The self-help book that's supposed to change my life?

I couldn't decide. I just... sat there.

By 11 pm I realized I had accomplished nothing. No breakfast, no movie, no book. I spent the entire day in decision paralysis, scrolling through options like a zombie.

**The weird part?** I saw this exact same story in r/ADHD a few weeks ago. Different person, same experience. Started googling ""why can't I make simple decisions"" at midnight like a crazy person.

# What I learned (and what actually worked)

Turns out this is called ""choice paralysis"" or ""the paradox of choice."" Some psychologist named Barry Schwartz wrote a whole book about it. Basically, having too many options makes us miserable instead of happy.

There was this study where researchers set up a jam-tasting booth. When they offered 24 flavours, hardly anyone bought anything. When they only offered 6 flavors, people were 10x more likely to buy. More choices literally paralyzed people.

Mind. Blown.

# Here's what saved my sanity:

**1. I started saying ""stop"" out loud when I catch myself overthinking**

Sounds stupid but it works. Last week I needed a water bottle. Caught myself with 15 browser tabs open researching materials and brands for a $15 purchase. Said ""stop"" out loud, picked the first decent one, ordered it. It holds water. I'm alive.

**2. The ""good enough"" rule**

Anything under $20 or reversible in 10 minutes = first decent option wins. No research, no comparison shopping, no 45-minute deep dives into Amazon reviews.

I picked 3 breakfast places and saved them as favourites. Monday/Wednesday/Friday = coffee shop. Tuesday/Thursday = smoothie place. Weekends = 2-minute maximum to decide. Has saved me hours of mental energy.

**3. Sunday planning**

I spend 30 minutes every Sunday planning my week's routine decisions. What I'm eating for breakfast each day, which gym classes, what podcast for my commute. Sounds robotic but it's actually freeing. When Tuesday morning comes and I'm half-dead, I don't have to think. It's already decided.

**4. Automation for repeated stuff**

Set up recurring grocery delivery for basics (eggs, bread, coffee, vegetables). Found one good coffee shop near home, one near work. That's it. No more wandering around looking for the ""perfect"" coffee like some caffeine-addicted nomad.

The crazy part? This didn't make my life boring - it made it more spontaneous. When I'm not burning mental energy on ""should I get oat milk or almond milk,"" I have some brain left for actual fun decisions.

# The uncomfortable truth

Most of our choices don't matter as much as we think.

That breakfast you stress over? You'll forget about it in 2 hours.

The Netflix show you spend 30 minutes choosing? Half of them are decent anyway.

The restaurant you research for 45 minutes? Food is food.

We've convinced ourselves every choice is life-or-death when most are completely reversible.

**The goal isn't perfect decisions. It's making decisions and moving on.**

Because while you're sitting there comparing options, someone else is out there living their life.

Anyone else relate to this? How do you deal with choice paralysis? Am I the only one who's spent an hour choosing what to watch and then just going to bed?

I'm turning 60 next month and starting to think about selling my creative services company. We've been in business for over 25 years now. We create high-end photorealistic 3D animation for companies of all sizes. Primarily focused on product rendering and animations.

The revenue has been consistent at around a million dollars/year since COVID. After payroll, taxes and expenses, this leaves about $300K profit. Prior to COVID, the situation was better, with 1.8 million in 2019. Back then, I had 11 employees; currently, it's just five artists, including myself. I actually prefer the smaller size, to be honest—less payroll and taxes to worry about. My personal income hasn't changed. I still make the same. This company is an S-Corp.

What I don't know is how to market this company as it's very unique. This isn't a coffee shop or car wash here. It's very niche. We have some return clients of large companies, but we're always picking up random project one-offs too. 

I just don't know where to start. The end goal would be to sell this for $ 1 M+.

  
Do you have any tips for a guy like me? 

Thanks!

She was very flirty. She joined last summer, we was friendly as I helped her with stuff etc. but nothing more she once she bought me a gift when I had a special announcement last year which was out of the blue & I was surprised by and then later a gift for my birthday, when I came back from annual leave. It's only really since February and into march that we started communicating. We went to break together and walked to and from the station when on the same shift. She is single & I am in a long term relationship. We did talk and said we found each other attractive but it could not go anywhere but be friends. In May my partner suffered a bereavement and went away to her family for several weeks. This is when me & the lady from work, talked more outside of work and met up a couple of times at the weekend and after work had coffee together. We video called eachother and chatted. It was very flirty but never overly sexual, we would talk late into the evening. One time, when we was at the station she said ""come with me"" I said I would love to but can't. She respected that. We would hug when greeting each & over time, her kisses on cheek move closer to my month but never on the lips. We met in the park on the weekend & as I like to draw & she was interested in me drawing her. Then she wanted me to sit closer and hold hands & cuddle. There was no petting, she didn't want that, as that would be ""addictive""! Once she said my hands were cold and put them in-between her thighs! We as also held hands for a bit when walking around the shops. I got uncomfortable with this, even I do like her but I have a partner. At work, the next day I told her I was troubled by this & we should stop the physical side of our friendship. She seemed cross and her body language towards me changed. I messaged her to ask her about if we are ok, but her response was that she respected what I wanted & didn't want anything else from the beginning but to be a friends anyway. This week I finally got a chance to speak to her on the way home about it on how we were & she was dismissive & said she has had male friends who hugs and touch her legs etc and nothing happens. If she has a sexual partnership it's on another level! Which is the same for everyone I would say. She has changed her tune towards me, where's before I was this amazing friend who was good looking with a lovely personality who loved spending time with, now she can take it or leave it. She often talked about her ex who was abusive (and seemed to want me to comfort her)..now it was how she"" just divorced him""! As if it didn't matter.

Never kami nagpalitan ng phones or naghalungkat ng phones pero ngayon ko lang naisip para masagot katanungan ko sa utak since wala akong maayos na evidence.

Sabi niya, wala lang talagang signal bakit hindi ba daw ako maniwala at wala raw malisya yun kahit opposite sex.Gusto niya lang daw magkaroon ng new friends. 

Am I being paranoid or may mali rin ba sa handling niya ng situation? 😓

1lc61ma,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lc61ma/does_my_boyfriend_poisoning_me_help/,Does my boyfriend poisoning me??? HELP!,"Hi guys
I have a very complicated situation, and I honestly don’t know what to think about it.
I am 23M with the guy I’ll call V; he is around 50 years old.

I know a little bit about his background:
- he’s an engineer who has worked in the profession for around 20 years.
- he was fired because of his mental health issues. (He told me he was diagnosed with psychosis by his 1st psychiatrist and prescribed medication, but the 2nd psychiatrist has told him that he's not psychotic, but didn’t tell him to stop taking medication. He suspects that he has schizophrenia because his doctors told him he might have it. I think it’s because of all the stuff he’s using.) Now he’s on a pension.
- he blames his employer and his psychiatrist for stealing his job and 22 years of his life. ( I suspect he might have been in prison/ psychiatric hospital for that period.)
- he’s very hot-headed ( every time I mention specific topics like his current situation: taking pension, or manipulation techniques like gaslighting, he blows up on me.)

We have known each other for 2,5 months  (We’ve met on GRINDR. ), and after 2 weeks, V asked me to be in a relationship with him. At first, he was nice, caring and loving. I’ve moved in with him after 1,5 months.
I am aware he’s taking h*rd dr*gs  (I didn’t mind it because I’m a recreational user of pot), but lately, he’s acting very strange. Here are just a few situations from not that long ago: 

1. We’ve had a few instances of fights where he threw my things out of his closet and threatened to throw me out on the street, even though he knew I had nowhere else to go, even tho he asked me to move in with him.

2. One day, we hung out and had coffee in the cafeteria. A short walk after, when we were on our way home, V realised he had lost his phone and started to panic. He accused me of stealing his phone for an unknown reason to me. He stopped in the middle of a busy road and told me to get out of his car and look for his phone. When I refused to do it and tried to calm him down, V tried to throw my phone out of the window. (I didn’t let him ofc)

I’m a working immigrant in his country. I’m struggling with depression episodes, and because of it, for the first month, I’ve been taking antidepressants based on an SSRI (minimal dosage because of ADHD). (That's important information for later.) 
Now buckle up for the ride :) 
So, for the last 3 weeks, I’ve been very weak. I was out of breath while walking up the stairs (even tho before we had met, I could run 5 miles without any problems). Every day, I’ve felt lightheaded even in the middle of the day. I could barely eat anything because of nausea, and I was throwing up after almost every meal. I had very intense nosebleeds and disgusting scabs in my nose. I couldn’t walk properly, and at some point, I lost all hope for recovery because I’ve felt so terrible all the time.
Since I’ve come home to my family, I feel normal again, like nothing happened. I had a doctor's appointment, and she informed me that the symptoms I had might have been caused by an overdose or a combination of some medications used to treat psychosis. (This might also be related to my medication because it can interfere with the medications I’ve taken in the first month of our relationship.)
After those words, I’ve realised my boyfriend might be poisoning me while we are together.

I’m suspicious of that because of a few situations:
- Every day, V insisted on making every meal for us.

- During one fight that I described earlier, I ran away to the bathroom sobbing, and had a breakdown because when I was sitting there, he started to ask me irrational questions, ""Who are you working for?”, ""Are you an agent?"", ""How much are they paying you?"", ""I can help you/ I can protect you from them, but you have to tell me who it is?""

- One morning, while drinking coffee and scheduling plans for the day, I was overwhelmed by him, and I told him, ""You put too many ideas in my head” (before I could even think). He freaked out, started to threaten me and told me that the last guy (he described as a nice guy) ended up dead and his house burned down. My first reaction was, like,  WTF? It has nothing to do with me, but later I thought, why would he tell me that?

- My family home is under my name, and it’s quite large (but nothing very fancy). My parents still live there. He often asks me about my home and advises me to sell the property and invest the money into something better, or go with him around the world. 

- When I started to suspect that something was wrong, I was looking for answers. The first thing that came to my mind were his medications for some reason. One day, I took a photo of his medications for psychosis, and now I can’t find it
( I'm almost sure he deleted this photo in panic because I might've found out by myself how his medications work and what effect they might have on me. He had full access to my phone.)


We had plans to go on holiday together, and I’ve told V that we'll stay in my family's home.
At first, he wasn’t comfortable with the idea of him meeting my parents after such a short time being together, so he didn’t go with me, but after a few days, he suddenly changed his mind! He started love-bombing me and wouldn’t stop texting and calling me at any time of the day or night. He even offered to fly in the second week of the holidays.
I’m afraid because of what I know, I suspect he might want to poison my parents too, because he knows I probably would let him convince me to sell my house if my parents had died. My dad is an elder, and my mom is recovering after surgery, so there’s a bigger chance that their health might drastically decline to the point of death.

I can not stand the thought of him possibly getting away with it or hurting another person after me.

1) I've no coffee at home and I'm not ordering one because I absolutely hate bru and I've been procrastinating doing my research and due diligence before picking a brand that will help me make the best cold coffee ever. I like my cold coffee strong and negligibly bitter. 

2) My room is a cave of dust. God knows where the dust accumulates from but you blink the eyes and it feels like a fairy godmother sprinkled star dust, sorry, filthy dust all over my room. The worst part is that it doesn't even glitter, just makes me sneeze like a COVID patient. 

3) I'm sick and tired of shaving hair on my face. It grows back 0.001 seconds later.Like bitch, I just cut you short. I can't weed you out. Stop growing back so fast. Behave. 

4) I'm not able to make up my mind about this colleague who pisses me off. Why don't I like her? Why does she give me an ick? Am I envious of her? Is she envious of me? Why do I think she's shallow and has a pretty privilege which makes everyone  around her overlook her exaggerated attempts to talk in a childish manner to seek attention? 

5) I'm tired. Physically tired. So many chores to do. So much running around like a maniac. God bless mom. Don't know how she pulls it off. 

6) Dad is extremely entitled. Won't even lift a finger or serve his food by himself and will threaten to starve himself if mom shows him the mirror. He's always verbally abusing mom, mocking me, being a pain in our ass. 

7) I feel insecure. Unloved. Unworthy. Unwanted. Lonely. I feel like I'm constantly starved of love and affection. I'm always mothering and parenting my parents instead.

1lc5ylr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_HeyGoExploreWithme/comments/1lc5ylr/how_i_accidentally_offended_a_howler_monkey_and/,How I Accidentally Offended a Howler Monkey (and Lived to Tell the Tale),"I used to think monkeys were cute. You know, little jungle buddies swinging from trees, living the dream. That was before I met *him*.

It started with a peaceful morning in the rainforest. I was staying in a cabin near Uvita, trying to embrace nature and all that. Coffee in hand, I walked outside to enjoy the sunrise, when suddenly the jungle *roared*. And I mean *roared*. A deep, guttural scream echoed through the trees like the jungle itself was having an existential crisis.

Turns out, it was a howler monkey. In a tree. Right above me.

Still half-asleep and overly confident in my “Pura Vida” attitude, I tried to be friendly. I looked up and casually said, “Hey buddy, you okay up there?”

That’s when the monkey stopped howling, locked eyes with me like a disappointed parent, and—no joke—*peed*. Directly. Down.

Now, it missed me by maybe half a meter, but the message was loud and clear: **this was his jungle, and I was the unwanted guest**. I backed away slowly, coffee still in hand, pride not so much.

Later, a local told me that howlers scream to mark territory, and that talking back (even politely) is not advised. Great. I’d basically started a turf war with a furry tenor in the trees.

So yeah—Costa Rica teaches you lessons. Some are spiritual. Some are biological. And some are just about shutting up when the monkeys are speaking.

Pura vida, I guess.

1lc5wrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MinorNotMajor/comments/1lc5wrh/story_009/,Story: 009,"Me: Write a story about a guy who has a best friend. Every time the guy dated a girl his best friend would hack her computer to “get to know her”. When he found something he didn’t like he would send an imposter to treat her badly and then wrap the story up for us. Testing out your creativity of conclusions.

ChatGPT: Title: “Proxy Hearts”

There was a guy named Theo who always fell too fast, too hard. The kind of guy who’d memorize a girl’s coffee order after the first date, who believed every song on the radio was about fate. But Theo had something—or someone—most people didn’t: his best friend, Jace.

Jace wasn’t just a regular friend. He was Theo’s shadow, his ride-or-die since grade school. He also happened to be a brilliant hacker. Not the hoodie-wearing, dark-room stereotype. Jace was clean-cut, worked a tech job remotely, and had a charming smile that no one suspected.

Whenever Theo met someone new, he’d talk about her nonstop. And Jace would listen, always with a half-smile and eyes calculating behind the scenes.

“You sure about her?” Jace would ask casually.

Theo, drunk on endorphins, would nod. “She’s different.”

Jace would sigh, crack his knuckles, and by that night, he’d be three VPNs deep in her laptop. Emails, browser history, cloud backups, even old notes from high school assignments—Jace read them all. “To get to know her,” he claimed. “To protect you from heartbreak.”

Theo never asked how Jace got the info. He assumed it was tech magic, harmless curiosity.

But Jace never stopped at discovery.

When he found something he didn’t like—a flirtatious DM from a few months ago, a saved folder of angry poems, a private journal entry doubting men—Jace never told Theo outright.

Instead, he sent in a Proxy.

A man, usually an actor hired off shady freelance gig boards. The Proxy would bump into the girl one day, pretend to be Theo’s friend, ex, or distant cousin. He’d plant doubt. He’d act weird, get possessive, start arguments. Sometimes he’d be drunk at brunch. Other times he’d “accidentally” reveal a secret she’d only told Theo, causing her to spiral.

And somehow, like clockwork, every relationship Theo had would end… abruptly. Always with Theo saying, “She just flipped one day. I don’t even know what happened.”

But things changed when Theo met Iris.

Iris didn’t post much. Her computer was encrypted. She lived mostly offline. But she had eyes that were made of old stars and an honesty that cracked Theo open like an egg.

Jace warned him.

“She’s too secretive.”

“She’s real,” Theo insisted.

Still, Jace sent a Proxy.

Only this one didn’t come back.

Two weeks later, the Proxy was found wandering the outskirts of town, barefoot, babbling about voices in his head and how Iris “rewrote” him.

Jace panicked. He confronted Iris directly one afternoon, unannounced.

She was waiting.

“I know what you’ve been doing,” she said calmly, pouring two cups of tea.

Jace, for the first time in years, was speechless.

“I read you the moment you keyed into my signal,” she continued. “I left the breadcrumbs for you. I wanted to meet you.”

“You… wanted me to hack you?” Jace asked, stunned.

She nodded. “I wanted to meet the person breaking Theo’s heart every time it got close to something real.”

He opened his mouth, but Iris held up a hand.

“You weren’t protecting him. You were protecting yourself. You’re scared of losing him. Scared he won’t need you.”

Her words struck like static in his chest.

And then she said the thing that finished the game.

“You’re in love with him, Jace. But not the kind of love that stays hidden in wires and algorithms. The kind that poisons everything it can’t possess.”

He left her house in silence.

Later that night, Jace wiped every drive clean. Deleted every trace of the Proxies. Smashed a laptop.

Theo never found out the truth. He and Iris stayed together, moving to a small city with no cell towers for miles.

Jace?

He disappeared.

But sometimes, people say that when relationships go bad in that city—really bizarrely bad—there’s a strange new Proxy who shows up, acting a little too familiar.

And sometimes, people swear he’s not human at all. Just a ghost in the system, still trying to protect a heart that was never his.",1,1750008562.0,u_MinorNotMajor,0,1.0,False
1lc5w9b,https://i.redd.it/5yc66fxtl47f1.jpeg,May I present for recommendation...,"Like everyone here, I was looking for something to read after Book 7. I tried other LitRPGs, some with Jeff Hayes, even. I tried books with supposedly similar humor. Most things I tried fell short, so I decided to try something a bit more tangential to DCC and not something that would just feel like a lesser version of my favorite book series.

Enter, Travis Baldree, aka Raul the Crab. One of the main themes of DCC is found family and building a community and that's what this book is about and does well. Basic summary is, what if an orc got tired of andventuring and moved to a small village and opened a coffee shop? That's the entire plot. How it was pitched to me was ""High Fantasy with Low Stakes."" and it was such an enjoyable read. Highly recommend!",85,1750008526.0,DungeonCrawlerCarl,32,0.93,False

1lc5vgb,https://i.redd.it/ixrpwqkal47f1.jpeg,June Drop - First Cup and Overall Impressions,"I've brewed a single cup of all 5 coffees I received for the June Drop. I'm excited to dial each in more but I have been quite impressed with what I've tried so far.

As I said in my prior post, I've been doing pour overs for a couple years but I stick with local beans and a subscription to one semi-local roaster. My ability to pick out tasting notes isn't great and I'm not picky.

With that in mind I have a few big takeaways.

It's fun to analyze coffee like this, even if I'm probably doing things sub optimally. Not controlling water so much, using a V60 instead of doing a cupping, just thinking about things in a free form way instead of using a tasting worksheet. It's nice to think about, what do I actually enjoy in coffee right now, how did my taste change, what would other people like, etc...

However, I don't really want to think so much every day. I like this once a month format. So for a few days I can think harder about things then the rest of the month I can chill and just enjoy. Excited to try and get into the 6 month sub and maybe try to train my palate a bit that way.

A big thing I've felt is real appreciation for the roasters I usually frequent. Their coffee is not far off from what I'm tasting here. Makes me happy to know I can easily get some good coffee at a great value and support some local businesses too.

I'm going to post a comment with my notes for each coffee. Cheers!

I’m the only one within 45 miles but there’s still competitive from farther stores as people out here are used to driving long distances already. I have lots of stories from the time I opened and I’ve learned a lot! Also, while this story does involve coffee, my primary business is retail. 

This day was fairly quiet- we had a couple shoppers here and there but otherwise not so busy. My husband was helping me this day and while he does his best, I’m still more adept at making coffees. This didn’t matter here though. 

Generally when people would come in and order a coffee first thing we would get it made and give it to them while they continue to shop. Cashing them out right away was something that I, at the time, concluded would create more hesitation in additional purchases. No one wants to stand at the counter and scan their cards multiple times in a row. I’ve since learned that people actually don’t mind that, and frequently when they’re here for long hours, it’s as though its a competition to see how many times they can scan their cards for a couple dollars at a time in one visit. One regular’s personal best was nine. We’ve begun running tabs. 

A couple came in, first time visitors though I wouldn’t call them customers. They each ordered coffees, frappes I think, vanilla. They continued to browse so my husband just jumped on making them while I tidied up around him. They received their drinks and sat down in our comfy chairs to chat, then the man brings his back. No flavor, he said. Weird, considering I was sure I’d seen him put just as much vanilla in as I normally do, and I had tasted it before made the same way and thought it was fantastic - but I added more; so at this point the drink had probably ten pumps of vanilla in it; blended it back up, and gave it to him. I was feeling particularly anxious about this screw up- we were a fairly new shop at the time and still learning the ropes, trying to entice customers to come back or to visit in the first place. How could we have screwed up something so simple? Surely these people wouldn’t be coming back and I had failed. 

They thanked me and continued to chat, shopping around a bit, enthused about how the coffee finally had enough flavor, and we got busy doing other things, helping someone else at the counter, cleaning etc, discussing how we’d made the coffee and how we could do better. 

Then they left. No transaction had been rung up, they never approached the counter to attempt to pay- no, they simply left, over-vanilla’d frappes and all. I blame this partially on myself, as I hadn’t stopped them on the way out, partially on my husband, as he had handled the order, and partially on the two people who complained about the flavor of the coffee and left without paying. I’ve never seen them again. 

Lesson learned- new visitors always pay for the coffees up front. Also, some people truly do have dead tastebuds. ",1,1750008221.0,TalesFromRetail,0,1.0,False

A couple months ago, my neighbor “Dick” (40sM) moved in next door, and things were pleasant at first until he started leaving notes at my door. Dick works the graveyard shift at a 24-hour fast food restaurant so he’s usually home after 9 AM the next day. According to him, his sleep gets disturbed when I get “too noisy.” First, it was the coffee grinder, then it was the laundry machine, then it was the TV, then it was music…the list goes on and on. He even told me once to stop thundering on the floor like an elephant (never mind the fact that this dude has over 200 pounds on me).

There’s only so much criticism a girl can take before she has had enough. I decided that he was so concerned about disturbed sleep, I would give him something that would really disrupt his slumber. I’m a classically trained coloratura soprano with a huge opera company, and I’m one of the top performers so I usually get major roles. As some of you may know, one of the most well-known coloratura soprano roles is the Queen of the Night from Mozart’s The Magic Flute (Die Zauberflöte). She has two solo arias, the more popular one being Der Hölle Rache kocht in meinem Herzen (colloquially known as the Queen of the Night aria). I started working on it in private lessons (yes, even we professionals take lessons; you have to maintain your craft), and I thought of the brilliant idea to practice it well after my neighbor goes to bed. He was so pissed he actually came to my door to talk to me in-person about “screaming while he’s trying to sleep” (I wasn’t; I was just singing super high notes), but I innocently told him that I was within my rights to practice during noise ordinance hours.

Afterwards, he apparently complained to the landlord, but the landlord dismissed him because of the time of day I used to practice. It’s been a few weeks, and I’ve never been so productive with practicing.",2,1750008195.0,AmITheAngel,1,1.0,False

1lc5o6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1lc5o6p/an_impassioned_rant_about_the_brand_dannam_as_a/,"An impassioned rant about the brand d’Annam, as a native Viet","This will only be tangentially about the actual perfumes, and mostly about how the brand decides to market themselves, so please bear with me. 

TLDR: Their fragrances are too mediocre for the price they ask for, their branding as a Vietnamese fragrance house is questionable at best, and at the end of the day I just really don’t like them lol. 

So d’Annam, as some of you will know or at least recognize, is a niche brand that has gotten relatively popular from their first collection, Enchanting Vietnam, inspired by our country’s heritage. I’ve only tried a handful, and at the time, I wasn’t too impressed. “Vietnamese Coffee”, while smelled nice enough, did not live up to its name - our coffee is strong and intense, with unmistaken-able notes of nutty butterscotch, and d’Annam’s version is comparatively anemic, with subtle hints of milk and roasted coffee beans. Basically, it smells like Starbucks’ coffee, and it left a bad taste in my mouth. “Pho Breakfast” also didn’t boat well with me - it’s also a simply nice aromatic herbal perfume, lacking the spiced heartiness of the broth, the umami, the slight tang of the vinegar/lime, the subtle kicks of spiciness from the hot sauce that’s almost exclusively paired with pho. An extremely complex dish was reduced to its own anemic version in fragrance form. I lost my interest after that, realizing d’Annam’s version of Vietnam that they wanted to sell were broad pastel brush strokes, while to me it’s always vibrant, chaotic, bursting at the seams.
 
But the smell was always objective. I was much more irked by the brand’s image, and I’ll give it to you through a numbered list, going from most egregious to my more petty reasons to dislike the brand.

1. The name. Annam was the name given to us by the French during their colonialism shenanigans, and I assure you, we hated it. Branding yourself as trying to bring to the world the beauty of Vietnam, just to turn around and name it accordingly to Colonial France is absurd to say the least. 

2. The concept. Vietnam, although small, is very culturally rich. We have 54 ethnicities, thousands of years of history, and a vast biodiversity. In short, if you want to explore Vietnam through fragrances, you’d never run out of things to get inspired from. So naturally, after launching the initial 9 fragrances, d’Annam, bearing our colonial name, switched to Japan. The fragrances remain anemic, their names semi-stereotypical (Moonlight Samurai sounds ridiculous but that’s my petty personal opinion lol). To be fair, they state on their website that they “celebrate Asian cultures”, not just Vietnam. I still remembered, though, how the marketing was during their first collection launch - it’s all about representing Vietnam. It feels weirdly similar to culture appropriation from a brand from said culture.

Here’s where it gets real petty, and I’m just gonna quickly list off my bitch eating crackers irks:

3. The price. 160 bucks for 50ml for a mediocre smell that doesn’t last that long? Are you mad?

4. On Fragrantica, they say a portion of the sales would be allocated to children’s charities. I haven’t been able to find any proof of this.

5. Their bottles are ugly, and a knockoff of Chanel’s. I hate the egg design so much.

6. They represent Asian cultures in the blandest, most whitewashed version possible. I hate the “zen” stereotype Asian countries sometimes get in perfumery.

7. They don’t have the Vietnamese currency on their website. Yes I’m salty. 

8. The AI ruckus a few months back. I’ve been side-eyeing their artwork ever since.

9. They focus so much on marketing, and initially got popular from sending their fragrances to influencers to rave about. 

10. This is my pettiest beef like ever: in their Japan collection, each fragrance has a Kanji translation under their English name. Ya’ll, the Vietnamese cities didn’t even get to have accurate tone marks.

1lc5nr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoardwalkEmpire/comments/1lc5nr4/nuckys_end_makes_no_sense/,Nucky's end makes no sense...,"Finally finished S5, and I was going over the deaths of the season, and realised most of them don't make sense, but Nucky's is particularly egregious.

Firstly, it feels like the show writers loved to setup a whole happy ending (Nucky gets all that money in the market, reconciles with Eli and Margaret and seems to be at peace with letting it all go) and then stealing it from us at the last moment. They do it with Richard, Chalky and Gillian. The trick just starts to get cheap and stale after a while.

But my main issue with Nucky's murder at the hands of Tommy is that how it actually goes down makes no sense.

Tommy was born in 1918, we know this because Angela tells Jimmy he's pregnant around the time Jimmy joined the SATC, which was formed in 1917. That makes him around 13 years old in October 1931, when he kills Nucky. 

Leaving aside the fact that they got a 23 year old Travis Tope to play a 13 year old boy, is it really plausible for a 13 year old to travel alone from Wisconcin to Atlantic City, get hired to move liquor, acquire a pistol and carry out an assassination, even in 1931? 

And why did Tommy end up like this? We know he moved to the Midwest with Julia to live with Richard's sister and her husband around the age of 6 or 7. Presumably they would have taken good care of him and raised him to be a decent person. So why does he suddenly decide to come back and murder Nucky, who he hasn't seen for 7 years, and throw his life away in the process? Was he really still that damaged about what happened? 

Apparently, his motivation to kill Nucky is that Nucky gave Gillian to the Commodore, but when did Tommy learn this? Surely Julia would have shielded him from that information, and Gillian couldn't have gotten that story to Tommy from inside prison/asylum. 

Tommy was only with Gillian for a year or two, and he was a small child then, and he didn't really like Gillian, so why does he feel such a burning desire to avenge his ""meemaw"" who he didn't like and hasn't seen for 7 years? Wouldn't he associate more with Julia, who he seems to consider his real mother by the end of S4? 

And it couldn't have been a desire to avenge Jimmy, since Tommy wouldn't have known that Nucky killed Jimmy. Richard knew Nucky killed Jimmy, but surely Richard wouldn't tell Tommy that, and whilst Tommy was with Gillian, Gillian was still insisting on the fact that Jimmy was alive and had gone away for some time. She only accepts that Jimmy was murdered long after losing custody of Tommy.

The actual timeline of how the murder takes place makes no sense either. Tommy comes into Nucky's service and has several opportunities to kill Nucky, but doesn't take them, because....? He only decides to do it after robbing some ladies, getting arrested, and then getting bailed out by Nucky? Speaking of which, since Nucky bails him out from jail, and they immediately go have some coffee on the boardwalk, and then Tommy immediately kills Nucky, when and where did Tommy get the chance to acquire a pistol? He couldn't have gotten it before he got arrested, since they would have searched him after the arrest and removed it from his posession. Does he get it in the 2 minutes between Nucky walking out of the cafe and Tommy come out to shoot him down? 

It seems what the show really wanted was for the whole ""Nucky gives Gillian to the Commodore"" and ""Nucky kills Jimmy"" storyline to come full circle by biting Nucky in the ass, and it didn't really matter to them how it happened. Nucky had to die, whether it made sense or not. 

It's contrived as hell, much like the rest of S5.

*BTW, this whole storyline also means that Richard's sacrifice was for nothing. Richard dies after getting shot after failing to kill Narcise, he tries to kill Narcise in exchange for Nucky telling the authorities where Jimmy's body is, Richard asks Nucky to do that so Gillian gets arrested and can't come back to take Tommy from Julia, Richard wants Tommy to stay with Julia so Tommy gets a good childhood and grows up to be a decent person, which won't happen now, since at 13, Tommy's already committed murder in the first degree in public, been arrested and is going to prison for much of his natural life.

These are all my words, but I word-vomited after the date into my notes and just used AI to organize the timeline so it’s neat. 

So I (30M) have been talking to this hostess (31F)  I met for about three weeks. The first night we exchanged Snapchat. We literally spent the entire night talking and snapping each other. But after the second week or so I noticed she was infrequently texting back and I asked if she was no longer interested or met someone else. Which is all fine. I just wanted to know for clarity so I don’t text her anymore if I’m bugging her. She got defensive and said no she’s just busy with work and stuff and we didn’t talk for three days until I apologized and she said she just needed time to think what she wants at this point. We didn’t go on a first date until the following week, which was the third week and this previous Wednesday.*

⸻

1. Park Pick-Up
	•	Time: Early evening, Wednesday, you were eating at a restaurant alone and showing her a screenshot of a music festival she wants to go to next month and saying that could be a fun date idea.
	•	You received her out of the blue “let’s go out tonight!” immediately after this exchange and rushed home to get ready.
	•	She said her brother (apparently they lived together at age 30) and her just had margaritas at home and he was being lame and went to bed but she doesn’t want to go to bed yet.
	•	Setting: You drove to the park she picked because she said she wasn’t comfortable letting guys know where she lives on a first date. She also said she didn’t have her car tonight that her brother and her share and as you drove there she kept rushing you saying “she’s going to go to bed soon if you’re not here” and spamming “tick tok” to hurry you. She also sent you nudes to “motivate” you to rush. You arrived, hugged, and she climbed in. You showed her the original bar that you wanted to go to and she immediately vetoed so you showed her a list of other bars and she only pushed for one of the bars on the list. You thought it was odd she was so eager for this one bar, but didn’t think anything of it at the time.

⸻

2. Arrival at Saloon
	•	First Minute (0–1 min in):
	•	You both go to sit down at the bar and she immediately says hey to one of the gentleman at the bar and tells you this is one of her regular customers at the restaurant she waitresses at down the road. You politely suggested she sit next to him and I’d sit on the other side, assuming they’d chat for a few minutes before your date resumed.
	•	Her body immediately pivots almost a full 90° away from you—hips, knees, torso all squarely facing the bar-owner guy.
	•	You only see the back of her hair; not even her cheek for almost the entire 90 minutes you were there.

⸻

3. “Just Hanging Out” (1–5 min)
	•	The bar owner asks, “What are you two doing here?”
	•	She responds, “Just hanging out,” deliberately omitting any mention of “date.”

⸻

4. Flirtatious Touching Begins (~5–10 min)
	•	As the bar owner talks, she reaches out repeatedly—placing her hand on his arm, brushing his leg, laughing into his shoulder.
	•	Her attention is fully on him, not on you. Her body is turned away and the music is blasting so her voice isn’t projecting to you and you can’t even make out every third word of the conversation. You try to interject and make conversation where you can but it’s difficult with not hearing the conversation and she doesn’t even motion to you, or turn her head whenever you do speak. She is constantly grabbing his arms or legs when talking to him as well.

⸻

5. First-Date Question & Face-Cover (~10–15 min)
	•	Bar owner turns to you and her: “So… is this a first date?” You answer “yes.” This is the second time in ten minutes he asked what you two were doing.
	•	She covers her face and eyes with her hand for several minutes, silently enduring the question.
	•	After 2–3 minutes of stony silence and you two awkwardly exchanging looks, she finally mumbles, “Can we move on?”

⸻

6. High-School Friend’s Arrival (~20–25 min)
	•	Her Florida high-school friend and that friend’s boyfriend walk in. The odds of her friend from Florida randomly being at this bar in Ohio on a Wednesday night is unlikely and possibly suggests they coordinated.
	•	She leans in to hug her friend, introduces briefly, then says, “Mind if I hang out with her? I haven’t seen her since Florida.”
	•	You agree, hoping this will reset the dynamic and let her have fun for a bit. You also hoped she’d invite you over to socialize with the four of you—but she grabs her drink and goes down to the other side of the bar.

⸻

7. First Seating Shift
	•	She slides down the bar stool: her friend on her left, the bar owner on her right.
	•	You find yourself two seats away—visibly isolated. The boyfriend chats with you for 20 minutes, perhaps to distract or politely include you.

⸻

8. Purse Retrieval Request (~35–40 min)
	•	She says, “Hey I need something out of my purse from your car, can I grab it?”
	•	You retrieve the purse and return it. In hindsight, you believe she did this to have her purse on her, ready.

⸻

9. Bathroom Break with Purse (Immediate)
	•	She and her female friend head into the bathroom together—purse in hand.
	•	You remain at the bar with the bar owner and her friend’s boyfriend.

⸻

10. Friends Depart (~1 hr in)
	•	Her friend’s boyfriend says goodbye. Her friend and he leave the bar. You realize she’s talking face-to-face with the bar owner.
	•	She slowly and reluctantly returns to the seat next to you and says, “Well this isn’t how I saw our first date happening.” You agree and she senses your frustration. After twenty seconds, she says, “Hey I’m probably going to stay out a little longer with my friend.” You respond, “Oh, you don’t need a ride home then?” She says no. You chuckle, pay for both drinks, give an awkward handshake with “Well, put it there partner,” and leave—assuming she’d join her friend outside.

⸻

11. Next Day
	•	You texted her friend’s boyfriend the next morning. He said that when he and his girlfriend left, they spent the night alone and never saw her again and THEY DIDN’T KNOW HER. She lied about them being friends. She never rejoined them—she stayed behind, likely with the bar owner (whose apartment is upstairs).
	•	You then text her:
“Hey how did the rest of your night go after I left? Did you end up just crashing at your friend’s place after hanging out with her? I wasn’t sure how you were planning on getting home lol”
	•	She replied: “Yeah we just hung out drank some more and I crashed at her place.”
	•	You asked, “Oh cool—did he stay up with you?” She said, “Yeah! He stayed up for a bit and then went to bed.”
	•	In reality, the boyfriend has no reason to lie: she did not spend the night with them and the boyfriend told me that she was actually a stranger and they never met her before.
⸻

OK, so now that is the whole timeline. And I fully realize I’m going to get the “Yeah I don’t think she likes you.” comments. I think that is an understatement. I’m just generally curious on what the heck even happened!? Like I gave her so many outs before beforehand saying we didn’t have to talk or go on a date or we could move on if she wasn’t interested. Did she literally spend a month and dozens of hours of talking just to get a six minute Uber ride to her friend’s bar and two beers out of me? Did she just have plans that night with this guy and needed a ride since he was drinking at the bar and I basically drove her to another date? It’s just so crazy because she complained that her exes would always gaslight her and lied to her and she told me that she is very honest and isn’t talking or hooking up with anyone else. (which she can because we didn’t even have our first date at the time)

But it just seems crazy to me that she literally ended up sleeping with another guy (99% chance) on OUR date. Well, I mean, she couldn’t even admit it was a date to the bar owner lol. We have seen each other in person before and have snapped hundreds of times so it’s not like she was turned off when she saw me. The car ride to the bar was pretty normal and fun and light. She quite literally never gave me a chance because as soon as she sat down at the bar, she didn’t look at me or even really talk to me the rest of the night. It’s not like I said something weird at the bar right away that turned her off… I quite literally never got a chance for me to mess something up that quick. I gave her plenty of easy outs before this if she wasn’t interested or attracted, she was the one randomly eager to see me this night. Did she just want to go out with her  friends/date and had me as a ride? Are there any ladies out there that could maybe clear up what you think happened to her? Did I just basically get used for a ride, two beers, and attention? I was just showing her about these music concerts that we should go to, and if she wanted to burn our relationship, I didn’t think she would burn it by using me as an Uber one time. I do want to confront her either on the phone or asking to go for coffee. What do you guys make of all of this?

TL;DR- You’d been Snapchat‐flirting with this hostess for three weeks before she suddenly went quiet after a joking “side-piece” comment and asked for space.
	2.	After apologizing, she agreed to a spur-of-the-moment first date Wednesday night and you drove her (no car) to a bar she’d recommended.
	3.	Within seconds of sitting down, she physically pivoted 90° to face a regular bar owner, greeting and touching him nonstop while ignoring you.
	4.	When he asked if it was a date, she covered her face for several minutes and then insisted they “move on.”
	5.	Her high-school friend and boyfriend arrived later, and she slid down the bar to sit between them and the bar owner, isolating you two seats away.
	6.	She sent you to fetch her purse from your car—then disappeared into the bathroom with her friend.
	7.	After her friend left, she told you she’d stay “hanging out,” and you later learned from that friend’s boyfriend she never rejoined them.
	8.	The next day she lied about crashing at her friend’s, but the boyfriend confirmed she actually stayed behind—almost certainly with the bar owner above the bar.

What in the world actually happened that night from an omniscient POV? A month just for a 6 minute ride to the bar and 2 drinks? Why go through all this? Or am I misreading something and she is just rude and not legitimately deceitful/evil?",0,1750007823.0,whatdoIdo,12,0.25,False
1lc5lzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/cartoons/comments/1lc5lzg/biased_objective_review_of_the_owl_house_or_why/,Biased objective review of the Owl House. (or Why The Owl House is a Bad Show),"I do not like The Owl House. It makes me recoil. At first, I liked it—I eagerly awaited each new episode. All those mysteries, Ida’s curse, Belos’s identity, and so on… But after taking a rational look at the series, I came to realize just how mediocre it is.  
  
Arguments like “The show was cut short, so you have no right to criticize it” just don’t work for me. A viewer shouldn’t have to come up with excuses for a product’s poor quality. I don’t care about the behind-the-scenes or the production process—I’m judging the final product.

Preface over, let’s begin.  
1. \*\*I don’t buy into this world, so I can’t get invested in the plot.\*\*

  
In the story, we supposedly have a dark totalitarian regime where anyone who doesn’t fit within the established rules is thrown in prison and then turned to stone. The prime law is the Ban on Wild Magic. Yet our main characters break nearly every existing rule—and face zero consequences. For example: Luz enrolls in a magic school, and the Headmaster just lets her and her friends study every form of magic they want. This is a school funded directly by the Emperor! And the Headmaster shows no concern that if the Imperial Coven suddenly inspected the school, they’d shut it down immediately. He’s also not bothered by the fact that breaking the Wild Magic ban could land him and these students in the Conformatorium. And isn’t the Headmaster supposed to believe that Wild Magic is dangerous? It’s as if Belos came to power yesterday and only just began his propaganda about Wild Magic’s dangers. Even if the Headmaster wanted his students to practice Wild Magic, fine—then at least have them do it in secret. But no! He takes these same students on a field trip to the Emperor’s palace. They don’t even bother changing out of their school uniforms, which clearly signal that they’re studying multiple types of magic!

In that same episode about the field trip, the heroes decide to steal one of the Emperor’s artifacts—and NOTHING happens to them. They openly criticize the Emperor on live broadcast—and NOTHING happens. They attack members of the Imperial Coven—and NOTHING happens. They’re seen hanging out with the realm’s biggest criminal—and NOTHING happens. Lilith goes against Belos—and STILL faces no repercussions. Moreover, she’s later hired to work at a museum, as if being branded an enemy of the people is no big deal. Wow—totalitarianism at its finest.  
That’s why I roll my eyes whenever the protagonists whine, “Life under Belos’s rule is awful” and how unfair his system is. BUT WE’VE ALREADY SEEN that if the heroes really wanted to, the world would instantly bend to their will. It’s everyone else who supposedly lives under a totalitarian regime, forced to adapt to its laws. But when it comes to the main cast, the world just reshapes itself around them. The only time the protagonists ever face any real consequences is near the end of Season 2, when they finally have to leave the Boiling Isles and hide from the guards. Do I even need to say that SHOULD’VE happened much earlier?

# 2. **Luz Noceda**

I hate this piece of garbage. Every time she’s on screen, I feel an uncontrollable hatred. This character doesn’t arouse a shred of sympathy in me. Because Luz is completely to blame for everything that happens to her. She’s literally the kind of person you tell, “Don’t go in there—it’ll eat you alive.” And she still goes in, gets wrecked, and then whines about it. Throughout the series, everyone tells her this world is dangerous, that humans don’t belong here. But she still chooses to stay. Fine if she’d ended up here by accident and couldn’t go home—like Anne in Amphibia. But no, she voluntarily stays in the Boiling Isles after being repeatedly warned how dangerous it is. That’s why I don’t give a damn about any attempt by the creators to make us pity her. I refuse to feel sorry for a dumbass who knowingly went somewhere she didn’t belong, got her ass handed to her, and now cries, “Oh, I’m so miserable and traumatized.” Her whining reaches its peak in Season 3, when Luz starts beating herself up because, indirectly, it’s her fault Belos found out about the Draining Spell—and this self-flagellation, begging the audience to feel sorry for her, doesn’t work at all. First, because of everything I already said. Second, Belos would’ve gone after the Collector anyway. Luz and Lilith played a minimal role in that. Or do you really think Philip wouldn’t have found another victim to distract the monster? Luz is just beating herself up for nothing, even though she’s committed plenty of other transgressions that she doesn’t feel the slightest guilt for! Which ones? Well… for example, that time this idiot started screaming and having a meltdown inside enemy territory. And the reason she ended up there is even more ridiculous. After King learned some pretty shocking facts about his origins, Luz decided it would be A GREAT IDEA to sneak into the Imperial Coven’s compound to steal ONE TOY to make King feel better. And she didn’t even think about the risks! Because King would immediately feel better if she got caught and executed! Which is exactly what happens. Give thanks to Luz and her stellar emotional control. And if it weren’t for a contrived plot miracle, Ida would’ve died because of Luz. AND OF COURSE Luz faces no repercussions for such a colossal screw-up. No punishment, no reprimand. Or take the time when Luz ditched King, even though she promised to spend that day with him, and went off partying with Willow and Gus. And at the end of the episode, they made King look like the bad guy. I think I’m starting to understand why she had no friends in her own world.

 2.1 \*\*How Luz’s Problems Are Presented\*\*

From the first episode all the way through Season 3, the show practically yells at us that Luz is this poor, miserable, misunderstood soul—”Nobody wants to understand or accept her.” Yet in the story, her weirdness really disrupts other people’s lives. In the very first episode, because of her irresponsibility, Luz accidentally frees a bunch of snakes, which then attack other students. But, of course, by the end of the episode, they frame it as not Luz being a stupid idiot, but rather “society just doesn’t want to accept her as she is—a stupid idiot.”

But the main issue is that Luz’s personality hurts not only everyone around her but herself as well. Luz is gullible. Way too gullible. She believes these random prisoners who claim they were locked up for no reason. It never even crosses her mind that they might be lying to trick her into freeing them. In that same episode, she agrees to stay the night with complete strangers. Because when you crash at the house of strangers who are wanted fugitives, you make new friends instead of waking up in an ice bath missing a couple of organs—that’s apparently the moral of this show. And let’s not forget the second episode, where Luz’s naiveté is finally slapped in her face and she’s forced to face reality. I might have even liked that episode if Luz hadn’t stepped on the same rake again, blindly trusting Philip and ignoring all of Lilith’s warnings. 

By the way, another reason I can’t sympathize with Luz in Season 3 is this: if you get deceived once, you’re unlucky. But if you get deceived twice, you’re an idiot. And I have zero desire to wipe the tears of an idiot. Back to that second episode— I did actually like how the show tried to deliver the message that Luz isn’t “the chosen one,” but that doesn’t mean she can’t become someone great. And it’s so sad to see how they completely ruined it. In the finale, it turns out Luz was, in fact, the Titan’s chosen one all along, and he’s been guiding her, teaching her glyph magic. They even give her the strongest, most special Palisman. Compared to Luz, Philip is far more inspiring. Everyone tried to hold him back—even the Titan himself tried to hide glyph magic from him. And yet, the guy still became the most powerful magician in the Boiling Isles, built his own empire, and even when they “killed” him, he survived and continued making everyone’s life miserable.

3. \*\*Magic\*\*

I actually like the way magic is divided in The Owl House—because it’s not just the usual elemental split. The whole coven system is genuinely interesting. Glyph magic, especially the use of drawing symbols to cast spells, also looks really cool. What isn’t cool is that the rules for how glyphs work keep changing every time. One moment you have to touch a glyph to activate it; the next, it triggers from a distance. Sometimes, to make a spell more powerful you must draw a larger symbol; other times, a tiny scrap of paper causes a massive explosion. But those are minor annoyances compared to one plot point I still don’t understand: why did Luz even need to attend the local magic school? I mean, how are they supposed to teach her glyph magic if none of them knows anything about glyphs themselves? It’s like going up to a French teacher and saying, “Teach me Mandarin.” Throughout the series, we see Luz learning everything about new glyphs and combinations on her own. In other words, that school serves no purpose for her—she probably just goes there to hang out with her friends more often.

And going back to Luz being allowed to learn multiple types of magic: surely the school has a curriculum that follows the “one student—one coven” rule. That would mean Luz can’t really study even one discipline properly, because she’d literally have to be in several places at once. Their education system doesn’t even account for learning multiple magical disciplines. Unless, of course, the world once again bends to Luz’s will and the school completely reworks its schedule and curriculum in a matter of days? ;)

 3.1 \*\*Edalyn and her magic\*\*. To me, one of the clearest examples of sloppy magic mechanics is Edalyn. All she does is flaunt the fact that she hasn’t joined any coven and can use multiple types of magic at once. But when it comes to an actual battle, the most creative she and the writers can manage is basic fireballs and teleportation bursts. By the way, which coven does fireball magic belong to? And teleportation?

Where are the unique combinations of covens that I expected to see? Even the students in the Basilisk episode were coming up with more creative mash-ups than our “Miss Strongest Witch.” That’s why I felt nothing when Edalyn got the Bard Coven mark—because I never saw her make full use of the Wild Magic she supposedly had.  
4. \*\*Character Relationships\*\*

\*\*4.1 Edalyn and the Boiling Isles\*\*

What also bothers me about Edalyn is how she interacts with the Boiling Isles. Supposedly, she’s the most wanted criminal in the realm, with a huge bounty on her head. But as the series goes on, you completely forget about that, because our “Most Wanted Criminal” casually sells her wares at the local market—and she’s only ever been chased down twice at most. Wouldn’t it make more sense if Edalyn sold her goods on the black market? Over the entire show, only two (maybe three) characters even tried to betray her. The rest of the time, she just strolls through public spaces—like the local magic school—without anyone even thinking, “Hey, let’s report her to the Imperial Coven and claim that reward.” And if Edalyn were truly the most dangerous, wanted criminal, the Imperial Coven would have hauled her off to the Conformatorium ages ago. There’s nothing stopping them from gathering a big squad and raiding her house.

\*\*4.2 Edalyn and Lilith\*\*

Still, Edalyn is one of my favorite characters in the show, and she has really strong arcs and conflicts. The main one, of course, is her Curse and how she learns to live with it—gradually accepting that part of herself. I genuinely appreciate that, in the end, she doesn’t just get rid of the curse and reclaim her old powers. It’s one of the few mature storytelling choices in the series. But… why can’t Edalyn just cast spells with her staff? Luz, a human, had no trouble using a Palisman that didn’t belong to her. Or does staff magic get distorted, too? If so, they should have shown us that—right now, the characters look like fools who just whine about being helpless instead of trying the most obvious solution. But that’s just a sidebar.

I also love how the Owl Beast affected Edalyn’s relationship with her family, and I generally enjoy the episodes featuring Edalyn’s parents. And I like the way the Clawthorne sisters’ arc begins, especially Lilith. I particularly appreciate that the series doesn’t paint Lilith as a one-dimensional villain, but it also doesn’t absolve her or shift the blame onto someone else. Lilith’s actions were horrible, and Edalyn is right to be angry with her sister; at the same time, Lilith sincerely regrets what she did and spends the rest of the series trying to make amends. That gives us a solid, mature conflict. But! But! BUT—but but but—where is the resolution to that conflict? Because after the Gwen episode, Lilith simply disappears from the storyline and only appears in a couple of episodes that don’t advance her arc with Edalyn.

So, my little viewer, were you excited about a new character joining the main cast, hoping for fresh dynamics, new conflicts, and interesting interactions within the heroes’ group? Well, tough luck.

In the end, we never get a clear resolution to that conflict. I still have no idea whether Edalyn has fully forgiven Lilith or if she’s still mad at her. And speaking of Edalyn, she basically has no proper interactions or arcs with any other characters anymore.

\*\*4.3 Edalyn and Luz\*\*

Luz’s very presence puts a damper on things. But even objectively: why did Edalyn let Luz live in her house? Luz helps Edalyn with her business in exactly one episode. Every other time, she’s either in the way or just freeloading off Edalyn. Maybe Edalyn took Luz in because she wants to pass all her magical knowledge to her? Edalyn only formally trains Luz in two episodes—and even then, she does so begrudgingly before dumping her off at that ill-fated school.

\*\*4.4 Edalyn and King’s Relationship\*\*

Here’s another duo of main characters. And maybe I missed something, but when exactly did King go from being Edalyn’s funny neighbour to her adopted—damn—son?! In Season 1, I never noticed any parent-child dynamic between those two.

(And a brief aside: I do like King’s arc in Season 2, when he stops being a sidekick and becomes a fully developed character, grappling with the realization that he’s basically a demigod in this world)

But Edalyn, in Season 2, basically transforms from a cool, independent woman into a doting mother figure for nearly every kid in the show. I wouldn’t even be this upset if the series itself didn’t claim to be “unconventional,” “breaking stereotypes”—all while turning a badass grandma into… well, just another maternal character. Sigh. Apparently, a female character can only be a motherly figure or else be miserable over her partner.

\*\*4.5 **Edalyn and Raine’s Relationship**\*\*

The romantic drama between these two drives me nuts for a few reasons. First, by introducing this subplot, they completely abandoned the Clawthorne sisters’ conflict. Second, Raine feels like a mere function. Their role is to be the “revolutionary” character, and I can’t bring myself to call Edalyn and Raine’s relationship a “good romance” when one of them exists only to serve a narrative purpose. The problem is that the show never properly explains why they turned against Belos. I mean, we’re told that when Raine began teaching at the Bard Coven, they discovered that the Emperor was forcefully recruiting students, and anyone who refused “disappeared.” Okay… so am I supposed to believe they rebelled against Belos simply because he’s coercing witches into covens? Even though Belos never tried to hide that fact! 😂 He literally conducts public executions on live broadcast! But Raine talks about it as if they only just found out once they were in Imperial service. And shouldn’t Raine have accepted this as normal after years of brainwashing about the dangers of Wild Magic? Apparently not. It’s Schrödinger’s propaganda—both there and not there at the same time.

I could have bought it if Raine opposed Belos because of Edalyn—like, “After getting to know her, I realized all the rumors about Wild Magic are bullshit, that wild witches are decent people.” But nope! There’s not a single mention of Edalyn influencing them. Their only stated motivation is, “Well… I just don’t like that the Emperor is forcing people to join covens 😢.”

\*\*4.6 Belos and Raine\*\*

Speaking of Raine and Belos, I’m just upset about all the wasted potential here. Think about it: Raine and Belos share exactly ONE—just one!—scene together. The show’s ideological rival to the antagonist barely interacts with antagonist. There’s zero ideological confrontation, zero clash of ideals—nothing.

  
Moving on to some hot takes and pairings. First of all, I want to point out that this show has a downright unhealthy obsession with turning EVERY single—emphasis on EVERY—duo of characters into romantic partners. Obviously, characters can’t simply be friends, allies, or soulmates. No, it absolutely has to become romance, even where it makes zero sense. It feels like they tack it on just to pander to fans and shippers. And every pairing in The Owl House follows the exact same formula: the “cool sigma woman” and the omega who blushes at every glance she gives them. Okay, I’m exaggerating a bit—sometimes both characters literally turn red as tomatoes. But let’s go one by one. First up: The Boss Of This Gym.

**4.7 Lumity**

Lumity drives me up the wall. First, it’s teenage melodrama**.** And Lumity themselves are so saccharine-sweet that it makes my teeth hurt. Second, I hate how their relationship even started and what they did to Amity. Luz decides to make the first move on Amity not because she’s recognized any of Amity’s good qualities, but simply because the character in her favorite book, Azura, also “befriended her enemy.” So, why shouldn’t Luz do the same? It’s important to note that before this, Amity was bullying Luz’s friend Willow—pretty harshly, too. But Luz didn’t care! That’s why she tries to befriend the person who has been actively ruining her friend’s life—well, most of it, anyway. Anyone surprised Luz had no friends in the human world? 

Then, in that same episode, Luz royally screws up by reading Amity’s diary, helping Edric and Emira mess with her, and on top of it, ruining Amity’s favorite storybook hero—who nearly kills those two. After that episode, Amity suddenly gets a crush on Luz. But after everything that happened, their relationship should have been, at best, neutral. Nope.

“B-b-but Luz helped Amity defeat that monster!” Oh wow, what a hero—Luz decided to clean up the mess she literally caused herself. Give her a medal. After that, in subsequent episodes, Amity starts getting anxious around Luz, even when Luz isn’t even there. Meanwhile, our ditzy girl keeps messing up and putting Amity’s life in danger. And this isn’t one of those “hero in peril because of circumstances” moments—Luz is just doing stupid, reckless stuff because she’s obviously an idiot. Like in the episode where she decided to steal Amity’s magical wand. Not borrow it. Not ask permission. She straight-up snatched it, and surprise, surprise, the Blight siblings and Edalyn almost died because of it. So yeah, Amity, that’s definitely the person you should be worrying about in Season 2—and you’re terrified of messing up around her? Where did your Season 1 pride go? Where’s even a shred of self-respect?

And after that, Amity herself falls under the “main character’s sidekick” curse and becomes just an accessory to Luz. Most of Amity’s conflicts end up tied back to this protozoan. Her fight with her parents boils down to Luz—particularly that episode about her dad, which should have focused entirely on just those two. Instead, Luz and her problems get shoehorned in.

\*\*4.8 Amity and Willow’s Relationship\*\*

The only conflict of Amity’s that wasn’t tied to Luz was her friendship with Willow, which she was forced to sacrifice because of her parents. At first, I was intrigued. Until I really thought about this arc. The problems start all the way in Season 1, when supposedly “good” Amity—who still apparently cares about Willow—just randomly starts picking on her. In the woods. Completely alone. Where no one could see. With no need to play the “mean girl” role.

Then we jump to Season 2, where we get a big hint that Willow is still angry at Amity and hasn’t fully forgiven her—and honestly, I understand. You can’t just forgive years of bullying in one conversation. But in the next episode about the two of them, that whole forgiveness conflict just gets dropped—period. Instead, we get a brand-new conflict where Amity can’t accept that Willow has grown stronger and doesn’t need protection anymore.

Excuse me, but what the hell? WHERE, I mean literally WHERE, was there any hint of this before? It might have worked if Amity had previously had to protect Willow from Boscha’s harassment. But nothing like that happened. Blight didn’t give a damn that Boscha terrorized Willow and her precious Luz all day. And then Willow’s character development does a complete 180, and in Season 3’s second episode, they just shove in our faces that Willow is anxious now because she “feels responsible for her friends.” But… how? Where did that come from? I don’t recall one moment where Willow ever took on the role of the “mom” for the group.

4.9 **Willow x Hunter**

From what I’ve seen, this is the third most popular ship in The Owl House. And I’m 99% sure the writers only threw in a romance between them to appease the fans. Because Hunter starts catching feelings for Willow *just like that*—with the snap of a finger. One episode they barely meet, and in the next? He’s already blushing around her.

And once again, I ask: why can’t these two just be *friends* or *allies*?  
—""Because the stans and shippers will cry! 😢""

Also, honestly? Hunter is just not in a place mentally or emotionally to be in a relationship. The guy has the social skills of a stale piece of bread. He seriously needs to figure himself out before even *thinking* about romance.

5. \*\*Characters\*\*

\*\*5.1 Hunter.\*\*

Best. Character. In the whole show. I absolutely love him. His turn to the good side feels natural, well-paced, and actually makes sense. And he’s probably the *only* character who truly seems shaped by Belos’s rule. Which makes him feel like an actual *resident* of the Boiling Isles—not some tourist who just arrived yesterday and learned how things work. 

But, of course, Season 3 had to ruin my boy too. He starts off the season as little more than an punching bag and a tool to farm pity from the audience. 

And seriously—Hunter survived in the wild, he’s one of the Emperor’s most trusted scouts... but *this* same guy decides to poke a weird goo with the exact finger that has an open wound? Mister “I survived the Coven's deadliest trials” apparently learned *nothing* about basic hygiene or self-preservation. Incredible. 🤦‍♀️

And don’t even get me started on the wasted potential of his conflict with Belos. The Golden Guard had the *strongest* emotional connection to the show’s main villain. But in the finale, he basically gets reduced to a background character and becomes just another one of Luz’s quirky buddies. 😔

Like come *on*, this guy had every reason to want a showdown with Belos.  
—“Nah, that’d be too compelling. Let’s have Hunter help Willow with *her* issues instead, and then just forget he had any unresolved rage or trauma. ;)”

5.2 \*\*Gus\*\*

And finally, a few words about the last member of Luz’s squad.  
Gus is a useless, plot-convenient, Mary-Sue-adjacent character whose OP powers and out-of-nowhere emotional conflict just *magically appear*. 😡

In the episode with the head of the Illusion Coven, we suddenly find out Gus has insane magical powers that activate during emotional distress.  
Cool, right?  
Then *where* the hell were these powers earlier?!

Like, a bully made fun of him as a kid? Instant depression, I am ghoul 1000-7.  
But when he and his friends were nearly *murdered* back in Season 1? No biggie 🙂, no magical outbursts there!

Oh, and remember the time Gus was tied up in the middle of the forest? Apparently not stressful enough for our little Sue-boy.  
But when the Illusion Coven guy *grabs his wrist*?  
Boom. Full-blown emotional meltdown and the most massive illusion we’ve ever seen. Even the coven head couldn’t fight it off.

And this whole “Gus is obsessed with human culture” angle?  
It’s just dumb.  
The Boiling Isles *are* basically our world but with a magic filter slapped on. The mentality and behavior of witches and humans aren’t even that different!

So yeah—screw Gus. Absolutely useless character. Trash-tier.

\*\*4.10 Vee and Luz’s Relationship\*\*

Am I really the *only one* who finds the whole doppelgänger situation with Luz *creepy as hell*?  
Actually, no. It *is* creepy. Just think about it — some freak shows up, steals your identity, and starts living with your mom, pretending to be *you*. And Vee even brazenly throws Luz’s stuff out on the street. 

So yeah, Luz has every right to be mad. And she *is* mad! For, like, the first two minutes... and then just *forgets* that Vee stole her entire identity. Same with Camila — she doesn’t even care that a total stranger impersonated her daughter and lived in her house on her dime.  
—“But Vee has a tragic backstory! 🥺”  
Don’t care. Literally do not care.

Since when is a sad backstory a get-out-of-jail-free card for *actual crimes*?  
Because yes, identity theft *is* a crime. But nobody holds Vee accountable. Luz doesn’t bring it up again, Camila shrugs it off, and the writers pretend it’s fine. I hate when characters face *zero* consequences for their actions.

5.3 **Emperor Belos a.k.a. Philip Wittebane**

Honestly, I only started watching The Owl House because of this guy. In Season 1, he’s genuinely terrifying—a ruthless tyrant shrouded in mystery, and you can’t wait to learn his secrets.

I realized Belos was human the moment he appeared on screen. In the very first episode, we see a barrier that only *humans* can pass, and that barrier is maintained by the Imperial Coven. So why in the world would Belos build a barrier he himself can’t get through?

Plus, the fact that Belos is human gives him an emotional link to the main heroine. Both are ordinary humans, both ended up in a magical world, and both learned magic despite having no innate talent. But the creators went way overboard with those parallels and turned Belos into as big an idiot as Luz. He screws up in tiny ways—like, “Why in the heck did you not even *search* Edalyn when you captured her?”—and in colossal ways, too, because this moron doesn’t realize that the gigantic heart inside his castle—which was literally built in the chest of a Titan—*is* the Titan’s own heart. When you were constructing your castle, did you honestly think that heart was just a decoration, some flamboyant set dressing?

if Belos had realized what it was, he could’ve merged with the heart way earlier and wiped out the witches.

A prime example of the writers’ “I don’t care about my own story” attitude is Belos’s entire backstory—and how it was presented. It… wasn’t. We get a rushed, three-line summary of his past from Masha, plus a few images in the background. Yeah, I get that “visual storytelling” is a thing, but it doesn’t work like this—where the audience is supposed to piece together the villain’s entire backstory from a bunch of overheard exposition and random background snaps. But apparently, the creators think that’s fine, because they pulled the same stunt twice. Even after gathering all these fragments, we still don’t have answers to the big questions: Why did Philip kill his brother, whom he’d traveled to another dimension to save? Because he was a mindless fanatic who assumed his brother was “corrupted”? Why didn’t Caleb end up as fanatic as Philip? Why did these two brothers, raised in the same environment, have completely different views on witches?

—“Well, the runtime got cut!”—I don’t care. I really don’t. And the kicker is that, even with a shorter runtime, they still wasted precious minutes on junk we didn’t need. Can someone explain to me: did we *need* the arc where Luz and Amity hunt down the author of the Azura books? Or the arc where Edalyn whips up a truth serum? Hell, they could’ve devoted the entire second episode to unraveling the main villain’s mystery. But, dear viewer, pucker up and cry into your coffee. Instead, you get side-character arcs and Willow’s plotline, which is stitched on with white thread. And Belos’s downfall in Season 3—do I even need to mention it? mean, at least they didn’t piss on his corpse. I guess that’s something.

5.4 **The Collector**

You know what grinds my gears? How *everyone* constantly baby-talks this overpowered brat instead of just putting him in his place.

Take, for example, Episode 3: the Collector forces Luz and Edalyn to play all those deadly games.

And what does King do?  
Instead of using his magic on the Collector, he just stands there, watching him torture the two people he cares about most. I honestly don’t understand why King didn’t do *anything* during that Weirdmageddon and just let the Collector run rampant. It wasn’t like Luz had been gone for just a few hours—he was gone for who knows how long. Or maybe King remembered “First-Season King” and actually *enjoyed* seeing the Boiling Isles’ citizens suffer.

And I hate excuses like “But he’s just a kid—he doesn’t understand death, so feel sorry for him 😢.” First, this “kid” is hundreds of years old, and the show never says Archivists age or understand things more slowly than humans. Second, I don’t believe for a second that the Collector, after spending time with Philip, still didn’t grasp the concept of death—especially since titans were wiped out *in his presence* and he knew about the Draining Spell. Third, since when is ignorance an excuse? It’s hilarious how that logic works. The Collector and Belos are two sides of the same coin—both think they’re doing good, that their actions are perfectly justifiable. But we brand one as the embodiment of evil while cuddling and pitying the other.

# **6. Other**

A few minor nitpicks:

1. Why are Belos’s soldiers so utterly useless? I get that they’re supposed to be cannon-fodder for the heroes, but then why trumpet the fact that “only the toughest can survive the Coven’s trials”? Because I have a sneaking suspicion Belos just hires them through a “Help Wanted” sign.
2. When exactly did Darius and Eberwolf join the Resistance? If it was *before* Edalyn’s requiem episode, then why did Raine and Edalyn try to kill them? If it was *after*, how on earth did Raine convince them to betray the Emperor?
3. Collector magic never works on titans… except in all those scenes where it suddenly does.
4. That time-travel episode feels like a hasty attempt to plug the plot hole of why Belos didn’t just kill Luz at the end of Season 1. “Well, he knew she had to go back in time and help him find the Collector.” But then he also had no problem sending Lilith to the scaffold, even though *her* presence was also crucial for his plan. And he shouldn’t even remember what Luz and Lilith look like—he last saw them decades ago when they were just pawns in his game. Or does Belos really have a perfect memory for every single person he’s ever used? That’s some freaky recall.

# Bottom Line

*The Owl House* is terrible. Yes, it has a few strong points, but they all drown in a sea of flaws. I understand why the show became so popular, but I can’t say it deserves that popularity.

 a monologue over misery

I wanted nothing just bitter beans,
brewed in silence, stirred in screams;
A cup of calm in a cruel café,
where broken men come not to pray.

I lit my lungs with ash and air,
and tasted time just blank despair.
Not drunk, not high, not touched by flame,
just haunted by a hollow name.

I fake, I fail, I fall, I freeze,
I drink, I drown, I drag disease.
I force a feeling, feign a face,
then flinch at every warm embrace.

I chase the lie of being known,
but coffee cools, and I'm alone.
I sip, I stare, I see the truth:
I'm not a man, just mourning youth.

Not beast, not god, not born to bloom
I breathe inside a borrowed room.
And fear, that faithful phantom friend,
reminds me love is just pretend.

The soul is stitched with silent screams,
the mind a maze of midnight dreams.
I'm not meant to love or trust,
I rot beneath a skin of dust.

What matters when nothing remains?
What matters when meaning drains?
The moon won’t mourn, the stars won't speak,
and graves are dug for the dead who weep.

I’m not addicted just aligned
with cigarettes and shattered mind.
Coffee cradles what's left of me
a cup, a cough, a slow decree.

I once believed in beauty's light,
but beauty blinds, then burns to night.
Men murder mothers for a smile,
betray their blood, then brag in style.

If honest, he’ll rob. If faithful, he’ll cheat.
If gentle, he’ll stab, then claim defeat.
And I I can't even feel or fake,
I just exist for sorrow’s sake.

My name will fade, my bones will bend,
my thoughts will bleed, my time will end.
The earth won’t echo, the sky won’t sing,
death’s the only democratic king.

The ocean mirrored all but depth
it never spoke of what was left.
Not all graves are made of ground
some of us walk, yet never sound.

Regret’s a ghost that gulps the soul,
it gnaws you numb, then makes you whole.
A grave will rest your flesh and bone,
but guilt will grind you all alone.

I blink, I break, I burn, I bleed.
I lie, I lack, I long, I need.
But even need has left my skin
I’m not alive, I just begin.

The moon just mocks my quiet sip.
My soul a poem that lost its grip.
I toast to tears I’ve yet to cry,
and whisper words that wish to die.

I loathe myself in perfect light
hate needs a mirror, dark as night.
Each stanza is a sharpened blade,
each thought a debt I never paid.

So here I sit, my ghost, my guest,
my chest a cage, my heart at rest.
The cup is cold, the chairs are bare
no one, nothing, anywhere.

The breath I take is just a loan,
the bones I wear are not my own.
I speak in verses none will save
a living soul in walking grave.

And still I write, and still I rot,
for pain’s the only pulse I’ve got.
The world moves on I do not move,
I drink despair, and call it truth.

They say death is just and equal for all,
but mine’s more just I live my fall.
Alive yet absent, dead yet awake,
each breath a bruise, each smile a fake.

I'm not dying I'm just a delay,
killing time until it kills me someday.
And now that my coffee has finished its breath,
I sip on silence... and swallow death.

If honest, he’ll rob. If faithful, he’ll cheat.

each thought a debt I never paid.

the bones I wear are not my own.
I speak in verses none will save
a living soul in walking grave.

And still I write, and still I rot,
for pain’s the only pulse I’ve got.
The world moves on I do not move,
I drink despair, and call it truth.

They say death is just and equal for all,
but mine’s more just I live my fall.
Alive yet absent, dead yet awake,
each breath a bruise, each smile a fake.

I'm not dying I'm just a delay,
killing time until it kills me someday.
And now that my coffee has finished its breath,
I sip on silence... and swallow death.

 a monologue over misery

I wanted nothing just bitter beans,
brewed in silence, stirred in screams;
A cup of calm in a cruel café,
where broken men come not to pray.

I lit my lungs with ash and air,
and tasted time just blank despair.
Not drunk, not high, not touched by flame,
just haunted by a hollow name.

I fake, I fail, I fall, I freeze,
I drink, I drown, I drag disease.
I force a feeling, feign a face,
then flinch at every warm embrace.

I chase the lie of being known,
but coffee cools, and I'm alone.
I sip, I stare, I see the truth:
I'm not a man, just mourning youth.

Not beast, not god, not born to bloom
I breathe inside a borrowed room.
And fear, that faithful phantom friend,
reminds me love is just pretend.

The soul is stitched with silent screams,
the mind a maze of midnight dreams.
I'm not meant to love or trust,
I rot beneath a skin of dust.

What matters when nothing remains?
What matters when meaning drains?
The moon won’t mourn, the stars won't speak,

Well yesterday when I took a nap, I had a dream that I was literally wearing the same clothes that I was wearing when I initially went to bed and that my mom was wearing the same clothes and laying down on the couch downstairs watching TV like how she was before I took a nap. In my dream, I walked downstairs and stood over the staircase leading downstairs to tell my mom something as if I wasn’t sleeping and as if it was the present moment, genuinely as if it was maybe 30 minutes prior to me actually taking a nap. Suddenly, in the dream, I turn to the side and look in the kitchen and I see my dad wearing the same blue dress shirt, dress pants, and black jacket that he always wore while standing by our coffee station with his back turned towards me mixing his Taster’s Choice coffee in hot water like he always did multiple times a day. I jumped back in shock and put my hand on my chest and I go “Baba?” and he turned around holding his coffee cup in his hand and he said “Hi baba!” and he walked over, hugged me super tight, and then took his coffee cup and exited the front door. I woke up. And it was so weird because during all this “dreaming”, everything felt extremely real. Like even the hug felt beyond real. It was indescribable… it’s like as if he came to make his coffee, say hello to let me know he’s good and I’m good, and then just go back to wherever he is. Yesterday was the first time I’ve seen or felt him since he passed. I told my mom this story and she said she thinks he was visiting me to let me know he’s ok. She mentioned that she hasn’t seen him or felt him since he passed, either. I haven’t cried about his passing in a while.. but I’ve been in tears ever since this happened.

1lc5iit,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversalOrlando/comments/1lc5iit/helios_grand_review_a_stunning_convenient_resort/,"Helios Grand Review: A Stunning, Convenient Resort Plagued by Abysmal Build Quality & Customer Service","**Atmosphere**, **Location**: 5 out of 5  
**Food, Dining**: 2 out of 5  
**Room Quality (Pool View)**: 1 out of 5  
**Customer Service**: 0 out of 5

**Summary**: We booked 2 nights in a Pool View room along with a 1-day ticket and VIP tour to Epic Universe, both of which were flawless and worth every penny. But, sadly, our experience at Helios Grand fell very short of an ""epic"" experience. As it currently stands, this resort is nowhere near worthy of the rate we paid as Florida residents; just shy of $650 a night. This was a one-and-done for us, and we really wish we had spent the money at Sapphire Falls and just took the bus to Epic Universe.

**The Good:**

* The atmosphere and location of this resort is stunning. Walking back to the room after an entire day in Epic Universe was great. The artwork, color choices, and overall design are top-notch. The view from Bar Helios at night was jaw-dropping.
* Breakfast at Flora Taverna was fantastic... the food was delicious, and our server was very attentive.
* There's a parking garage.

**The Bad:**

* This resort has the *worst* customer service I've experienced at any resort I've stayed at, not only at Universal, but Disney, too. It truly pains me to say that, because I've never had a bad experience with Universal/Loews Team Members. This was **unusually awful**.
* Extremely poor build quality. Our room had a ceiling leaking water. Other families were in the lobby with the same issue as us with leaking windows/ceilings. More to follow below.
* Quick Service options are extremely limited. The grab-and-go in the lobby has a small selection of over-priced sandwiches and coffee. We had to go to the pool bar to grab lunch... there are no rain shutters, so when it started downpouring (because, Florida), we had to move tables to not get soaked.
* The resort is not wheelchair/ECV friendly. Very few (if any?) of the doors are automatic with a button to open them. And, because of the design choices made, most of the doors are very heavy and difficult to open.

**The Unusually Awful, and Why We Will Likely Never Return:**

At around 8 PM, we noticed our room had a leaking ceiling. It rained at 5 PM that day, but only for a few minutes. We went downstairs and told the front desk, and they said ""we will send somebody up right away"". At 10:30 PM, after waiting 2.5 hours, maintenance never showed up. So, we made a second visit to the front desk. We politely explained that our ceiling was leaking water, and we had to put cups on the floor to catch the water and prevent water damage. The front desk Team Member told me they can't track maintenance, and we have no choice but to wait. She made no effort to give us any sort of status update. At that point, I asked to speak to a Hotel Manager, and she told me there will be a 15-20 minute wait to do that, so I was forced to take a seat in the lobby. Meanwhile, our ceiling is dripping water for nearly 3 hours. Oof.

I started conversing with other Guests in the lobby who were having the same issue as us; one man I spoke to was in a King Suite and his windows AND ceiling were leaking water... they moved him to a Standard View 2 Queen Room since that was all that's available, and gave him a $100 gift card for the inconvenience.

Finally, at 11 PM, the Hotel Manager came out from the back room to speak to me. The lack of sympathy was truly shocking. He genuinely seemed like he didn't care, and offered a whopping $100 gift card. I kindly explained to him that all we needed was an update on how much longer it will take maintenance to come and fix the leak. He could not provide an update. Because it was after 11 PM and we desperately needed to sleep after being in Epic Universe all day, the ""solution"" was to cancel the maintenance request and make a note on our reservation that we are not responsible for water damage to the carpet/floors. Listening to the ""drip, drip, drip, drip"" all night was painful, because we knew it was going to cause mold and mildew on the floors and carpet in our room.

We had really high hopes for this resort, but in its current state, I urge anyone to book elsewhere on Universal property (I recommend Sapphire Falls) until they have time to fix all the issues currently plaguing the resort. Perhaps the customer service will improve as well, once those issues are resolved.",14,1750007581.0,UniversalOrlando,1,0.94,False

Models with higher HP motors tend to be more effective at grinding bones, fibrous vegetables, and other challenging waste.

**Grind Chamber Material and Durability**

The grind chamber is the workhorse of the disposal unit, and its material plays a vital role in its longevity. Stainless steel is the gold standard, known for its resistance to corrosion and wear. Other materials, such as galvanized steel, offer a more budget-friendly option but may not last as long. The most advanced models incorporate reinforced polymers to further enhance durability and reduce noise.

**Noise Reduction Technology**

garbage disposals have a reputation for being noisy appliances. However, advancements in noise reduction technology have made quieter operation a key selling point for premium models. Features such as sound insulation, vibration dampening mounts, and optimized grind chambers contribute to a more pleasant kitchen habitat. Measured in decibels (dB), the quietest disposals operate at levels comparable to a standard dishwasher.

**Ease of Installation and Maintenance**

The installation process can be a significant factor for many homeowners. disposals designed for easy installation typically feature rapid-mount systems and clear instructions.Similarly, maintenance should be straightforward, requiring minimal effort to keep the unit running smoothly.Self-cleaning features and easily removable splash guards are valuable additions.

**Anti-Jam Technology**

One of the most frustrating issues with garbage disposals is jamming. To combat this, many models now incorporate anti-jam technology, such as auto-reverse functionality or specialized impeller designs. These features help to prevent clogs and keep the disposal operating efficiently.

## Core Benefits

The best garbage disposals offer a range of tangible benefits, from improved kitchen hygiene to increased convenience and reduced environmental impact. Choosing the right disposal can substantially enhance your overall kitchen experience.

**Enhanced Kitchen Hygiene**

Properly disposing of food scraps is essential for maintaining a clean and hygienic kitchen.A high-quality garbage disposal eliminates the need to manually remove food waste, reducing odors and preventing the build-up of bacteria in your trash can.This contributes to a healthier and more pleasant environment for cooking and eating.

**Increased Convenience and Efficiency**

A garbage disposal streamlines kitchen cleanup, making it faster and more efficient. Instead of scraping food scraps into the trash, you can simply rinse them down the drain. This saves time and effort, particularly when dealing with large quantities of food waste after meal planning.

**Reduced Environmental Impact**

Garbage disposals can play a role in reducing environmental impact by diverting food waste from landfills. When properly processed at wastewater treatment plants,food waste can be converted into biogas,a renewable energy source.Moreover, reducing landfill waste helps to conserve valuable resources and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

**minimized Plumbing Issues**

A well-maintained garbage disposal can actually help prevent plumbing issues. By grinding food scraps into small particles,it reduces the risk of clogs in your drain pipes. This can save you money on costly plumbing repairs and prevent inconvenient backups.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about garbage disposals to help you make an informed purchase.

**What size garbage disposal do I need?**
The appropriate size garbage disposal depends on the amount of food waste your household generates and the size of your kitchen sink. For average households, a 3/4 HP disposal is generally sufficient. Larger families or those who cook frequently may benefit from a 1 HP or higher model.

**How often should I clean my garbage disposal?**
It is recommended to clean your garbage disposal at least once a month to prevent odors and maintain its performance. you can do this by grinding ice cubes with lemon or lime peels, which helps to dislodge food particles and freshen the unit.

**Can I put bones and coffee grounds in my garbage disposal?**
While some high-powered disposals can handle small bones,it's generally best to avoid putting large bones in the unit,as they can damage the blades. Coffee grounds can also cause clogs over time, so it's advisable to dispose of them in the trash or compost bin.

**What should I do if my garbage disposal gets jammed?**
If your garbage disposal gets jammed, turn off the power switch and use tongs or pliers to remove any visible obstructions. Some disposals have a reverse button that can help to dislodge the jam. If the problem persists, consult a qualified plumber.

I just want to say first that I'm quite overwhelmed by all of this, and I'm only coming here because while I've gathered some of my friend’s opinions on this, I fear that they're just being kind to me because they know I'm upset about the situation, so I wanted to get other people’s thoughts. 

I am a college student who just finished my senior year, and now, after being granted the chance to do research through a scholarship, I am heading into a fifth year. I am attending a very small Methodist college, which is not super religious in the sense that they force religion onto the students, but they do have a chapel on campus, and they hold small groups and services several days a week.

Personally, I have a complicated relationship with faith. I don’t really want to get too deep into why that is here, because that’s not really the point, but I do think some context into why is relevant: let’s just say an extensive trauma history of sadism and neglect from my caregivers as a child formed me into a young adult who came into college having a really hard time with the whole ""God"" thing. 

But before I even began classes my freshman year, I went to a meet-and-greet where students could meet faculty and staff members that they'd see around campus. And at this meet-and-greet, I met one of the pastors who worked here. He's a pretty cool guy. And seemed genuinely interested in having a conversation with me, and was very attentive to what I had to say, and didn’t mind when I told him sort of ‘tongue in cheek’ that that conversation would be probably the only one we’d ever have because I wasn’t someone who was particularly interested in anything having to do with church. Actually, he’d laughed, and told me that that was fine, but he also implored me to come back and meet with him after the school year started if I was so inclined. 

But I didn’t. Not until the end of the last semester of my sophomore year. Despite being toxic for me, I had, up until that point, been trying to hold onto and preserve my family ties, but something happened that was the final straw and I felt like I was entirely alone. That, I think, was the lowest and darkest point in my life yet. I didn’t see a reason to exist anymore. The campus was empty because classes were over, but I knew that there were still a few services left that went into the summer, so one night before a service started, I came to him and told him I still didn’t want to talk about God; I just needed a human connection. He seemed to understand. 

Over that summer and the next two years (until last week), I confided everything to him. Everything I had gone through, and everything I was feeling at the moment. When the moment was appropriate, he shared things with me. I think it eventually became clear to both of us that the reason that we were able to have such good conversations was because we shared a lot of similar experiences when it came to living through a traumatic childhood. Eventually, we began to talk about God. I’m an academic at heart, so we’d talk about theological perspectives, but I began to ask him questions more about my life. He became my pastor. I was coming to him for spiritual advice. 

So, here’s where things have gone a little messed up. Last week, he asked to meet for coffee. He was behaving strangely, and wouldn’t look me in the eye until he blurted out “I got a job at another church, and I am officially separating from (my institution) next week. This means that you and I will no longer be able to meet or talk. Because I am leaving here, I am setting a boundary where I want to keep my old job separate from my new, sort of ‘turning over a new leaf’. Do not call or text me. I’m sorry if this is upsetting, but I did talk to (another staff member at my institution) about you, and I told her some things about you, you know, what you’ve gone through, and I think that she may be a good resource.” 

He then turned, and waved over that staff member. She came over, he then stood up, and she took his place. He said goodbye to me, and left. The other staff member looked at me, and gave me a smile that felt, to me, really, really fake. I felt like I had been punched in the gut. I was trying really, really hard not to cry. I don’t know if this woman didn’t notice, or if she just didn’t care, but she started to talk about some of the things that my pastor had told her about me. These were things I had told him in confidence, and they were definitely things I never would have told him if I knew he was going to go tell someone else it. 

To me, knowing that he went and told this random staff member some of these things has been making me spiral. I have been sick to my stomach for the last week, and crying in random bursts. I don’t feel like I can leave my apartment. This campus is so small it holds the energy of a small town where once a piece of juicy information gets out, everyone sort of knows everyone and everyone’s business. What else has he shared about me? And who has he shared it with? 

This was wrong of him… right? I’m devastated. I’ve lost a relationship I really valued, and I feel so betrayed. My friend says I should report him for this, but I don’t know who I would even report him to? I’m just wondering how someone could cut someone off like that. AIO here? Does this seem reasonable to y’all?

1lc4yrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/turnstile/comments/1lc4yrz/an_open_discussion_for_those_that_are_new_to/,An open discussion for those that are new to hardcore through Turnstile,"One of my favorite things to come across on this subreddit are those that have found Turnstile and, by extension, hardcore as a whole. The dominant reaction tends to be questions about what they do now, whether it be anxiety about how to not be a sore thumb at shows or to just outright learn more. Since I can’t do a PowerPoint presentation on reddit, hopefully this may be the next best thing that could be helpful on some of those questions. Let’s help those new to the hardcore community feel welcome. We were all the newbie at some point. 

-The biggest thing about getting into this or any subculture is the anxiety of finding where you fit in. It may take time but you will find your people. Best thing you can do: explore more bands and get yourself to some local shows. Everything from hashtags on social media concerning your local area to bulletin boards at coffee shops, record stores and event spaces will steer you in the right direction. While it’s great to be able to make it to a Turnstile show, there’s nothing like getting to see some local bands you could walk up to and buy a shirt or grab a sticker right from them to show your support.

-It sucks to be the new person in these atmospheres and feeling like you don’t know what you’re doing. Despite the sure anxiety to do so, talk to people. Whether it’s a shirt of a band you found you like, or just wanna small talk between sets with people around you, just be genuine. Not everybody is gonna want to, but you WILL find your people with patience and effort. It’s also ok to be a loner too if you don’t wish to connect in that way. However, it becomes very easy to end up connecting with people sometimes from all over the world with different perspectives and journeys and life stories if you find yourself getting to know the people around you.

-The absolute most important part of this whole thing: BE YOURSELF. This is a community of all types of people. You will encounter people you don’t like, bands you don’t like, along with people that tend to feel protective of the community, sometimes in a very toxic way. These people don’t speak for the community as a whole. We all find are way to this subculture because we’re seeking something to connect with. So find yours that works for you. If you don’t wanna mosh or end up in the pit, you don’t have to. If that interests you, pay attention and study the etiquette and there’s no shame in practicing in your room. We’ve all fuckin done it. Just help each other out and pick up anyone who falls.

I’m sure there’s more. I hope others will add to this.

I was so well behaved that my mom would dig through dirt, just to find something to yell at me for. 
I'd get yelled at for showering because apparently I was ""wasting water""
I was yelled at, because she got mad that she had to wash the same pair of pants in one week.
I was yelled at for not hanging a towel on the drying rack ""correctly""

         She would get mad that my desk was a ""mess"" and it was just a coloring with a crayon box on it. If my sister and i was making each other laugh, she was angry. If i ate too much, she was angry. If i ate too little, she was angry. If i breathed too hard, she was angry.

         The things that i was yelled at for, was incredibly tame compared to what a bad kid actually did. I was treated like the spawn of satan or something. I was the definition of obedient, and yet it was never enough to please her. She would search for the tiniest spec of dust, just to yell at me. She acted as if i was out to get her or something.

       I remember her saying things such as, ""You're only doing this to piss me off!"" She was fully convinced that i was going out of my way to rile her up. In reality, i just didn't care about my environment being in pristine condition. Like who actually cares about a vase being 1inch out of place?  Who cares that a towel to wash your hands is slightly off center?

      I highly doubt that she had OCD because the things i was yelled at for, didn't even make sense. My mom would scream at me for locking the bathroom door while I was showering. It was definitely a controlling issue. You'd have to be some kind of nutcase to be mad at someone for setting boundaries and, wanting privacy.  Being yelled at for things that didn't even matter, made a huge impact on ny mental health.

     I had to be so cautious of my actions because, a simple thing such as one leftover candy wrapper on the counter, could set my mom into a rage. Oops i left my purse on the dining table, now shes gonna freak out! Uhoh, i wrote something in my dairy she didnt like. Now shes going to hang that over my head forever! It became so mentally exhausting, that i eventually stopped trying to please her.

     There was so much going on in the world, and she would be angry over spilled milk. She was so out of touch with reality, that she didn't even know what actual problems were. She treated a minor inconvenience like it was a huge deal. A simple thing such as a misplaced coffee mug, and she'd act like her house was burning to the ground.

I live on 10 acres with access to about 100+ more from my property. It’s peaceful and quiet, which is wonderful, but also makes our lives and especially dog training look very different from what most advice online assumes.

I’ve had dogs most of my life, but after a long gap, I adopted a 12-week-old super mutt pup 9 months ago. He’s now a 45-pound goofball who brings so much joy to our quiet life and property.  

I work from home full time, like some folks living rural. Pup and I are always together except when he's out exploring in the acres I went broke over to fence in :)  Unless I plan otherwise, we can go days without seeing anyone except our awesome mailman, UPS driver, and occasional visits from friends and family.  When I read advice based on sidewalks, regular exposure, and frequent social encounters, I wonder how I’m supposed to even make that happen.

For a while, I felt guilty, like I was doing it all wrong. Some progress is very slow! I burned out trying to create training setups that didn’t fit our life. Having lived and raised dogs in mostly suburban environments, it took me way too long to realize how different raising a dog in the sticks was. 

* **Socialization looks different** \- We do not run into people or dogs daily, unless it's intentional. Exposure takes effort. Early socialization windows are harder to take advantage of, but adolescent and adult dogs can still learn. Focus on what makes sense for your life and don’t stress about those critical windows.  You’ll get there when you get there.  
* **Recall usually matters more than heel** \- We mostly walk in the woods on long lines.   Not quite ready for full off leash but will get there soon, likely with the help of an e-collar.  A heel has little use for us yet so often I am told that it is foundational to training. What matters to me is leash/lead awareness, situational awareness, natural check-ins, pup being able to think for himself, and of course, solid recall. 
* **Prey drive is real** \- Wildlife, chickens, barn cats, oh my!  There is distraction and temptation everywhere. Many training programs skip over our reality. If you have a high prey drive pup, I highly recommend Simone Mueller’s predation substitute training. It helped me and pup a lot.
* **Resources are limited** \- Pet stores, group classes, behaviorists, and trainers can be over an hour away and not always a great fit. We worked with 2 trainers based out of our nearest city and even their guidance made little sense.  Sometimes we have to figure things out ourselves. I’ve made mistakes, gone through a ton of trial and error.  We're doing great!  Pups are pretty darn forgiving.   
* **Risk is real, and sometimes FF & R+ fall short**  \- I consider myself balanced but lean heavily into positive reinforcement, especially early on after adopting or for young pups, but rural life brings real risks. Wildlife, acres of woods, and big, open spaces all mean safety must come first. Tools like e-collars should be used thoughtfully and with proper education, but they can be essential for off-leash communication and freedom. Not every dog needs them, but they should not be dismissed by those who have never lived this life.
* **Our Dogs Are Imperfect** \- Maybe it is just me, but if I were to rely on social media standards, my dog is a hot mess!  Lol!  JK.  He is the goodest boy - super chill, independent, and yes, occasionally mischievous in these fun adolescent years.  The perfect standard just doesn't make sense to our life and a good bit of training, or at least the approach, simply doesn't apply.  I also have zero desire for a perfect dog.  Sure, manners and obedience are super important but I am very OK with a dog just being a dog.  I want him safe and to live the best dog life, that’s all.  

My pup may never lay quietly under a cafe table at an urban coffee shop, or be the best candidate for 'bring your dog to work' day but he hikes, camps, hunts, loves long car rides, keeps the rodent population in check, keeps the pesky wildlife away that eats my gardens, has so many fun spaces to explore, has jobs and does them damn well (and takes them seriously!), and sleeps soundly every night in my bed from all the things he gets up to everyday. He is awesome and most importantly, I think he’s really happy.  That makes me happy!  

Would love to hear how others have adapted training to rural life. What has worked? What have you let go of?

1lc4lot,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1lc4lot/i_need_to_be_seen/,I need to be seen.,"Today is Father’s Day and my husband went to play 18 holes at 6am with his buds. The plan was to meet him at a different course mid morning for mini putt and the driving range with our two kids (5 and 8.)

My kids have been going insane lately - school is almost over and summer is looming, I get it. But recently they have gone from “not listening” to NOT fkn listening and getting into trouble. 

Before we even left the house today they decided to knock all the clean and folded laundry off the bed twice and throw it around the room. Both times I asked for their help cleaning it up and they refused.

We stopped at a park on the way to the course and I let them play while I drank a coffee. My oldest chased an injured bird and wouldn’t listen when I asked him repeatedly to stop. He caught it, it was terrified, he wouldn’t wash his hands after or even walk to the bathroom with me because I had to pee. 

I was so upset, I told him I can’t take care of him if he refuses to listen. 

The youngest one has a minor infection in his nailbed. We started driving again and he informed me he was picking it, again wouldn’t stop. We got to the course and it was an open wound. I turned around and drove them both to the walk in clinic. 7 days of antibiotics needed for an infected swollen finger.

We are not going to the course. My husband is home now. We tried to have a family meeting and both kids just yelled over us while accusing us of being the ones who “always yell.”

I don’t yell that much. I am trying to use reason and logic. I am trying to teach them that I’m a human being, I don’t have super powers, I’m just me and trying to do my best but I feel invisible. I feel disrespected constantly. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to be a mean parent like mine were. I don’t know how to punish them without feeling like an asshole. Someone please tell me the magic trick to getting kids to listen for their own safety and wellbeing. ",26,1750005363.0,breakingmom,14,0.93,False
1lc4kxc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lc4kxc,M20 ogpp afterthought,"Hi all, I just hit m20 on ogpp this morning on Sunday with insane crit meal and would like to share my strategies and contribute to this sub since it helps me a ton getting where im at.

1. Meal prep: so first thing first, I cook defiant coffee salad for this week since my ingredients mon synergies well with ogpp berries. I prep a little bit of sausages and oil enough for three meals and plan to use my aggron and luxray on the daytime during the event, and mostly prep for coffee and potatoes, i think i had 200 sth each going in the event

2. Crit meals: This is my main strategy, I run two deddenes the whole week, only switch out until my crit chance is above 50%. Even then my luck this week was REALLY bad, I think there were multiple times that i didn’t hit crit even when my crit chances are like 60%. 
Now let’s talk a bit math. In order to get m20 on ogpp your daily goal is around 950k give or take. With the event boost and pot size boost, my max level defiant coffee salad gives around 200k each meal, with three meals thats 600k and that leaves 350k for berries. This is WHY crit chances are so important. I need at least one crit per day to catch up. Some days are behind but it evens out.

3. Berries: This week is a cooking event so berries don’t get any bonus. But still having a lvl 60 bfs+ helping speed raichu(or any other berry mons) is so important. Especially running them during sleep time so you don’t waste any sneaky snacking. 

4. Rotation: I run my two ingredient mons base on what i lack, two dedennes and a healer which is pawmot during daytime, swap pawmot to berry mons if enough energy. I run raichu, two deddenes for early morning crit, a healer and another berry mon or an ingredient mon with inv L (in this case my vigavolt for coffee) during sleeping time. 

5. Helper whistle: If you stock helper whistle like i did, this is a good time to use it. I swap full ingredient team and use two whistle to stock up my bag during this week. Also vaporean helps a ton since with the pot size increase i could barely keep up.

Overall, ogpp seemed pretty tough without the event but it is quite doable with event like this. Now all i have left is taupe hallow and I’m pretty sure I will get it next cooking event. Feel free to ask any questions in the comments! ",3,1750005305.0,PokemonSleep,1,1.0,False
1lc4klq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Layoffs/comments/1lc4klq/will_ai_progress_stop_because_less_people_want_to/,Will AI progress stop because less people want to do tech jobs?,"
Before AI, tech used to be a dream. I remember when twitter workers would brag about free coffee, free food, relax rooms, game rooms. Work in tech was chill. Working at faang was like the big goal for everyone.

Computer science was the top major in college cause people wanted to work at facebook or make the next facebook and get rich.

But now in 2025 things changed a lot. Tech is seen as one of the worst choices. Entry level jobs are super hard to get. Even top college students compete with thousands of others. Plus no job security at all. Companies do performance reviews and if they don’t like your results you might get fired. And AI made things worse by boosting productivity so companies lay off even more. Some ceos literally say mid level engineers will be gone in 2 years.

Even top senior engineers are getting laid off. A lot of work is being sent to india.

Tech is a mess now. Who in 2025 wants to go to college and study computer science. It's over. Tech is dead. Too risky now with AI moving so fast and companies wanting less engineers.

Starting your own product is hard too. Like making your own app or startup. Too much competition and most people make little to nothing.

So who even wants to go into tech anymore?

Government jobs seem way more stable. Stuff like medicine, dentistry, or nursing. Yeah it’s hard work but at least you know you’ll have a job and money.

Tech? No way. You can work hard, have experience, be really smart, solve tough problems, and still be out of a job. Imagine being in your 40s with tons of knowledge and no one wants to hire you. Total disaster. People thought they’d be set for life but ended up with nothing.

It feels like a scam. People spent years learning and studying only for the whole job market to dry up. Companies just stopped hiring cause they have AI now.

Why would any smart person go into tech? Being a mcdonald’s worker is more stable and better for your mental health honestly.

How is AI supposed to keep growing if no one wants to learn computer science anymore?

Even facebook said they can't find top AI talent. Well no wonder. Why would anyone study tech just to get thrown out later? You help them build AI and then they fire you. They don’t want to share profits with workers.

Instead of spending 20 years learning computer science and solving hard math problems just to be unemployed, it makes more sense to study something safe like law or dentistry. Something AI can't take so easily.

Tech jobs have no future anymore. And if people stop going into tech, then yeah AI progress might actually slow down. Cause who wants to spend their life on something that ends with getting laid off?

Physically active and in solid shape at 195 lbs—happy to swap pics once we’re chatting.

When I’m not chasing sunbeams or iced coffee, I’m usually planning my next trip. Travel has been a big part of my life lately, and I’ve got some exciting plans lined up for Asia and Europe next year. I also want to check out more of the West Coast and Midwest.

Live music is a big love of mine. Whether it’s a packed venue or an outdoor summer show, I’m always down to see a band I love. My playlists bounce around from alt rock to electro to indie, but I'm open to almost anything—even country if you've got the right track to convert me. Oh, and I’ve been learning salsa… slowly. Let’s just say I’ve got the enthusiasm down, the steps are a work in progress

Outside of that, I’m a big fan of manga, the occasional anime, and I’m deep into board games and indie video games. Slay the Spire, Hades, and Fallout: New Vegas are my current favorites. I also like cooking (especially seasonal recipes), baking, dancing, a bit of swimming and being cozy.

If any of that sounds like your kind of energy, I’d love to hear from you. Looking to connect with someone 24+ preferably on the East Coast—but if you're elsewhere in the US and we click, I’m open to seeing where it goes.

1lc4iiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1lc4iiv/ben_hated_having_to_attend_pump_and_what_his/,Ben hated having to attend Pump and what his future looked like,"Ben stared at the gas pump, the metallic glint mirroring the dull ache in his head. ""Pump,"" he muttered, the word tasting like ash in his mouth. He'd escaped UTEP, escaped El Paso, but the cursed nickname, a constant reminder of his academic torment, still clung to him.

UTEP, or as he venomously called it, ""Pump,"" was supposed to be a springboard. Instead, it felt like a trap. A glorified extension of Franklin High's AP program and Hornedo Middle School's relentless curriculum, all rolled into one merciless university. He'd envisioned a life beyond El Paso, beyond the shadow of his mother's suffocating expectations. But his dreams were crushed the moment she forced him to attend UTEP, a place steeped in the very culture he desperately wanted to escape.

The academic rigor was brutal, a constant, unrelenting pressure. The professors, jaded and indifferent, seemed to take pleasure in the students' misery. No extra credit, no helpful study guides, just a relentless barrage of information that barely connected to the exams. “Pump sucks, man,” he’d told Parring countless times. Parring, a born-and-bred El Pasoan who genuinely adored UTEP, would always respond with an infuriatingly cheerful, ""Pump is wonderful!""

The worst part was the isolation. UTEP was a place for those who loved El Paso, who wanted to stay and build their lives there. Ben felt like a prisoner in his own skin. He remembered the fleeting moment of bravery in Biology 1305 with Dr. Mendoza, the day he'd followed Adriana out and stammered an invitation for coffee. Her curt ""No"" still stung, a microcosm of his entire UTEP experience.

Graduation had felt like freedom, until he realized his UTEP degree was worthless outside of El Paso. He landed a job at a gas station in North Texas, a far cry from the bright future he’d imagined. The irony wasn't lost on him: pumping gas after being forced to attend ""Pump.""

The final straw was when he visited his mother. She, oblivious to his struggles, launched into a passionate defense of UTEP and El Paso, praising their ""unique opportunities"" and ""strong community."" It was then that Ben finally snapped. He disowned her, severing the ties that had bound him to the city and the institution that had stolen his dreams.

Now, fueled by a cocktail of bitterness and determination, Ben was planning his escape. He was saving every penny, meticulously researching colleges in Los Angeles. California, he hoped, would be a clean slate, a world away from the suffocating heat and academic rigor of El Paso. He imagined friendly faces, professors who cared, and a chance to reinvent himself.

He glanced at the ""Now Serving"" sign inside the gas station, his stomach churning. “Californians are definitely friendlier than Texans,” he muttered to himself, remembering his dismissive peers. “They didn’t help me at all.” He was done playing nice. He was done being the dutiful son. He was going to build a new life, on his own terms.

He’d even started researching new majors, something creative, something that sparked joy. Maybe filmmaking. Maybe music. Anything but the sterile, soul-crushing world of science that his mother had pushed him towards.

He squeezed the gas pump handle, the metal cold against his skin. ""Pump,"" he whispered again, but this time, there was a flicker of defiance in his eyes. ""I'm done with you. I'm going to Los Angeles. I will not do that to myself. I'm becoming a better man.""

He was still pumping gas, still stuck in a dead-end job, but for the first time in years, Ben felt a glimmer of hope. He had a plan, a destination, and the burning desire to leave UTEP, and everything it represented, far behind him. His journey was just beginning.",2,1750005138.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1lc4hnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1lc4hnn/the_tank_and_the_alien/,The Tank and the Alien,"*“Hey, so... you guys smell that?”*

Carried through the comms, the voice belonged to Corporal Blevins. 

From his sarcophagus of a driver's seat, he hadn't seen the sky in fourteen days.

“Smell what, Blev? The piss jug you’re too lazy to empty? Or the fact that we’re marinating in our own sweat?” 

The reply that came from Sergeant Avery was flat, scraped raw by fatigue. He was the tank commander. 

His was the lid of the coffin, the only one who could, theoretically, pry it open.

“No, smartass. Not us. Them.”

Avery keyed the comms again, his thumb resting on the worn plastic switch. “Cole, you got eyes?”

Specialist Cole, the gunner, didn't answer immediately. He was the reserved type. His world had shrunk to the eyepiece of the Gunner's Primary Sight, filled with shifting thermal signatures. 

The GPS was his god, the thermal imaging system his prophet. He saw the world in gradients of white and black, a ghostly mishmash of a dead city.

“Negative, TC,” Cole’s voice was a low rumble, the calmest thing in their steel world. 

“No movement. Thermals are dead. Just… ambient heat. The fires are still going over on 5th Street. That, and the pavement’s still hot from yesterday’s… sun.”

He almost said ‘flyover’. They’d learned not to call it that. Flyovers were for airshows. What the aliens did was something else entirely, a scouring of the sky that left glassed streets and melted cars in its wake.

“Copy that.”

Another voice, younger, laced with a tremor he tried to hide. 

“Maybe it’s nothing. Maybe it’s just… a dead one cooking somewhere.” 

Private First Class Manny Delgado, the loader. 

He was crammed into the left side of the turret, surrounded by the deadly cylinders of their remaining ammunition. 

Twenty one rounds total, including...

...six M829A4 armor piercing fin stabilized discarding sabot rounds, their depleted uranium cores promising a very bad day for anything they hit...

...ten M1028 canister rounds, essentially turning their 120mm smoothbore cannon into a city block sized shotgun...

...five M830A1 HEAT rounds. High explosive anti-tank. Good for buildings, good for big targets. They were a two million dollar, sixty eight ton paperweight with a very, very big gun. 

And a broken track.

The right track of the tank was gone.

Shredded two weeks ago during the initial push. 

A weirdly biological mine had unspooled a latticework of crystalline filaments that had sliced through the composite rubber and steel of the track pads like they were butter. 

The beast, their beast, “War Pig”, was hobbled. 

Immobilized in the intersection of Kinsley and Broad, a monument to a failed offensive. Command’s orders were simple, delivered through crackling, intermittent bursts over the SINCGARS radio.

“One-Nine-Bravo, this is Warlock. Maintain position. QRF is being marshalled at the port. I say again, a quick reaction force is being… organized. Sit tight. Warlock out.”

Blevins cackled.

That was twelve days ago. The radio had gone silent three days after that. 

The auxiliary power unit, the APU, sipped their remaining diesel, a quiet hum in the back of the tank that kept the batteries charged and the electronics from dying. It was the only thing that separated them from being a tomb.

“I’m telling you, I smell it,” Blevins insisted. 

“It’s that… cinnamon and burnt hair smell. The smell they make when they’re close.”

Avery leaned forward, pressing his face against the cold steel of his commander’s cupola. His own thermal viewer, the CITV, the Commander’s Independent Thermal Viewer, offered a panoramic view of their prison. 

A dead city. 

Wrecked cars formed a makeshift barricade around them, a courtesy of the tank’s final, lurching death throes. 

A clothing store, “Sophia’s Boutique”, had its windows blown out, mannequins scattered on the sidewalk like frozen, plastic corpses. 

One of them, a female form in a summer dress, was missing its head. 

Avery found that grimly appropriate.

He swiveled the CITV, the hydraulics whining softly. He scanned the rooftops, the alleyways, the gaping mouths of shattered office building windows. 

Nothing. Just the wind, carrying dust and the distant, almost subliminal hum of… something. 

The hive. Miles away, but they could all feel it, a thrumming in their bones, a pressure behind the eyes.

“Alright, let’s talk rations,” 

Avery said, changing the subject. He wasn’t ignoring Blevins, he was managing morale. They were down to their last case of MREs. Menu 17, Beef Stew. The one everyone hated.  

“We can have a whole one today,” he offered. “To celebrate… uh… Tuesday.”

“It’s Friday, Sarge,” Manny said softly.

“Friday, then. Even better.”

A sudden, sharp click.

Every man in the tank froze. It wasn’t a sound from inside. It came from the outside, sharp and clear. It was the sound of something hard and pointed tapping on metal.

Click. Click. Clack.

Cole’s voice was ice. “TC. I have contact. Left flank. On the wreck of the garbage truck.”

Avery swung the CITV. His blood ran cold.

It was there. A shimmering outline in the thermal scope, hotter than the background. It was perched on the overturned garbage truck, maybe fifty meters away. 

They called them Stalkers. It was humanoid only in the loosest sense. Long, digitigrade legs ending in hooked claws, a slender torso, and two sets of arms.

The upper set were long and scythe like, the lower set smaller, more manipulative.

Its head was a smooth, chitinous teardrop shape that swiveled with an insectoid jerkiness. 

It was tapping one of its sickle like claws on the truck’s chassis. Curious.

“Just one?” Avery whispered into the comm.

“Just one,” Cole confirmed. “Range forty eight meters. It’s… I don’t know what it’s doing. Just looking.”

“Manny,” Avery said, his voice dropping to a near whisper. “Load sabot.”

“Sabot up,” came the reply, followed by the heavy, greasy clunk of the breech block opening, the smell of cordite and ozone from the last shot they’d fired days ago, and then the solid, reassuring thud of the new round being seated. “Up!”

“Gunner, you have the shot?”

“I can hit it. Sarge, are we sure? The noise…”

He had a point. Firing the main gun was like setting off a bomb. It would announce their exact position to everything within a five mile radius. 

They had survived this long by being a rock. A silent, unmoving, uninteresting rock.

The Stalker cocked its head. It looked directly at the tank. There was no way it could see them, not through the armor. But it knew.

“It knows,” Blevins breathed over the comms, as if reading Avery’s mind.

The thing unfolded itself from its crouch. It moved with a liquid grace that was both beautiful and utterly terrifying. 

It hopped off the garbage truck, landing on the asphalt with a soft thud. It took a step towards them. Then another.

“Fuck it,” Avery said. “Cole, take the shot.”

“On the way.”

Cole’s world narrowed to the reticle in his sight. He centered the glowing crosshairs on the Stalker’s torso. 

He didn’t think about what it was. He didn't think about the biology, the civilization that built it, whether it had a family. He thought about lead, angles, and windage. 

His finger tightened on the butterfly trigger.

A deafening roar that was felt as much as heard, a physical punch of sound that vibrated through the floor plates and into their bones. 

The entire sixty eight ton vehicle rocked back on its suspension. 

The air filled with the sharp smell of burnt propellant. For a fraction of a second, the inside of the turret was illuminated by the flash from the breech, a hellish orange glow that threw their faces into stark, demonic relief.

Through the GPS, Cole watched the M829A4 round, a sliver of depleted uranium traveling at nearly a mile per second, cross the fifty meter gap in an eyeblink. 

The sabot round was a kinetic energy weapon delivered to hit, not explode.

The Stalker was shredded into a cloud of pink mist and atomized biomass. 

The round, carrying an impossible amount of energy, struck it mid torso and turned everything solid into something liquid and gaseous. 

Chunks of chitin, the consistency of wet ceramic, pattered against the storefronts nearby. A viscous slurry that had once been alien organs painted a ten foot long smear on the asphalt.

Silence descended again, heavier than before. The only sound was the high pitched whine in their ears and the frantic, metallic ticking of the cooling cannon barrel.

“Holy… shit,” Manny whispered, his voice trembling. He was already reaching for the handle to eject the spent casing, his hands moving on pure muscle memory. The hot, smoking shell clattered onto the floor. 

“Did you see that? It just… it just came apart.”

“Good hit, Cole,” Avery said, his own voice tight. “Everybody sound off.”

“Gunner’s good.”

“Loader’s good, Sarge.”

A pause.

“Blevins?”

“Peachy,” the driver’s voice crackled. “Just peachy. Woke me right up. Hey, you think they heard that?”

It was a stupid question, meant to be ironic, but it hung in the air. They had just rung the dinner bell.

Avery scanned frantically with the CITV. He half expected a tide of them to pour out of the alleys. But there was nothing. Just the silence. The city didn’t seem to care.

“Alright,” Avery said, forcing a calm he didn’t feel. “Back on watch. Fifty percent alert. Cole, you and I will take first shift. Manny, Blevins, get some rack time.”

“I can’t sleep, Sarge,” Manny said. His voice was small.

Avery understood. The adrenaline was a fire in their veins. He keyed the private comm channel to Manny’s headset.

“Hey. Look at me.” Manny looked up towards the turret ring, as if he could see Avery through the steel. 

“You did good, kid. You loaded the round. You did your job. We’re alive because of it. Now, close your eyes. Even if you don’t sleep, just rest your eyes. That’s an order.”

“Yes, Sergeant.”

Manny leaned his head back against the turret wall. He pulled a small, tarnished silver locket from under his uniform. 

He didn’t open it. He didn’t need to. 

He knew the picture inside by heart. His little sister, smiling, a gap in her teeth. 

He’d sent most of his pay home for her braces. He wondered if she ever got them. He wondered if there was a home to send pay to anymore.

The hours crawled by. The silence outside was more unnerving than any noise. It was a loaded silence, full of potential. 

Blevins, despite his protests, had fallen into a snoring sleep in his cramped seat. 

Avery and Cole kept their vigil, their communication reduced to grunts and single word observations.

“Heat bloom, sector four. Rooftop.”

“Just a vent. Dissipating.”

“Copy.”

It was during a moment of this tense quiet that they saw him.

A new thermal signature. 

Small. 

Man shaped.

“TC,” Cole’s voice was sharp. “Civilian. Hundred meters. Corner of Kinsley and Third. He’s… he’s running.”

Avery slewed the CITV and zoomed in. Cole was right. It was a man, thin, wearing ragged clothes. He was stumbling, falling, picking himself up again. He was running down the middle of the street, right out in the open. A suicidal act.

“What the hell is he doing?” Avery muttered.

“He’s not alone,” Cole said, his voice grim.

Avery adjusted his focus. Three more signatures, the familiar, terrifying forms of Stalkers, had emerged from an alleyway behind the man. 

They weren’t running. They were pacing him, flanking him. Herding him.

They were hunting for sport.

“Jesus Christ,” Blevins, now awake, said over the comm. He must have been listening. “They’re playing with him.”

The man fell again, and this time he didn’t get up. He just lay on the asphalt, sobbing. The Stalkers slowed their advance, moving in a tightening circle.

“Sarge…” Manny’s voice was pleading. “We can’t just… we can’t.”

“We can’t,” Avery agreed, but his tone was different. It was the cold, hard voice of command. 

“We engage, we give away our position for good. We fire the coax, they’ll swarm us. We fire the main gun, and that big one, the one we saw on the bridge last week, will come for us. We do nothing. That’s the order. We sit tight.”

“The order?” Blevins spat. “The order comes from a guy who’s probably sipping coffee on a destroyer halfway to Hawaii by now! Look at him!”

The man on the street had rolled over. He was looking in their direction. 

He couldn’t see them, not really, but he was looking at the biggest, most solid thing in the intersection. A symbol of the army that was supposed to protect him. He was looking at them for help.

One of the Stalkers darted forward. It didn't use its big scythes. It used one of its smaller, more dexterous hands, and casually backhanded the man across the face. 

The hit was dismissive, almost playful, but it snapped the man's head to the side with a sickening crack.

Something broke in Avery. Fourteen days of sitting. Fourteen days of listening to his men slowly lose hope. Fourteen days of being a target in a can.

“Fuck it,” Avery said. He said it quietly, a prayer of damnation. “Fuck it all.”  
He flipped a switch on his control panel, the one that overrode the gunner's controls.

“Blevins, get on the coax. Manny, load canister.”

“Sarge?” Manny’s voice was a mix of terror and elation.

“You heard me! Load canister! Now!”

The breech clunked open and shut again. “Up!”

“Blevins, on my mark, you stitch the street in front of him. Suppress. Don’t try to hit them, just scare them, make them duck. Cole, I have the gun. I’m going to do this myself.”

Avery’s hands flew across his panel. He was the commander, but he’d come up as a gunner. 

You never forgot. He laid the reticle of his own sight just to the side of the huddled group. A canister round was a low velocity shot. You had to lead it, even at this range.

“Blevins, MARK!”

The 7.62mm coaxial machine gun erupted, a ripping, metallic snarl that was shockingly loud in the quiet street. 

Tracers, visible even in the daytime, drew green lines across the asphalt, kicking up sparks and chunks of pavement just in front of the Stalkers. The aliens, surprised, flinched back.

It was all the opening Avery needed.

“Fire!” he yelled to himself, and squeezed the trigger.

The Abrams bucked again, but this time the sound was different. Not a sharp crack, but a deep, throaty boom. The M1028 canister round flew apart twenty meters from the muzzle, releasing a cloud of over one thousand tungsten balls, each the size of a marble, traveling at lethal velocity.

It wasn't a precision strike. It was an act of annihilation.

The entire area where the Stalkers had been standing was shredded. The aliens were not just killed; they were turned into a red mist, vaporized by a thousand tiny hammers. The side of a building was pockmarked as if by a hailstorm of meteors. 

A fire hydrant, caught in the edge of the pattern, burst open, sending a pathetic, gushing stream of brown water into the street.

“MOVE!” Avery screamed into the main comm. “MANNY, GET THE HATCH! GET HIM!”

This was the insane part of the plan. The part he hadn’t thought through. Manny, without a second’s hesitation, cranked the loader’s hatch open, exposing himself to the dead city. The reek of cinnamon and burnt hair, now mixed with the coppery smell of alien blood, flooded the tank.

“Blevins, cover him!”

Blevins was firing the coax in short, controlled bursts, stitching the alleyways and rooftops, just in case.

Manny, small and wiry, scrambled out of the hatch and onto the tank’s turret. He jumped the five feet to the ground, his combat boots crunching on shattered pavement. He sprinted towards the man.

“C’mon! C’mon, get up!” he screamed, his voice raw. He grabbed the man under the arms and started hauling him backwards. The man was dead weight, groaning, his face a mask of blood.

“He’s not moving fast enough!” Cole said, his voice tense. He was scanning, watching for retaliation. “Sarge, I think you really pissed them off.”

Avery didn’t need Cole to tell him that. A new sound was starting, a deep, resonant thrumming that was making the very air vibrate. It wasn't the hive. It was closer. Much closer.

“Manny, leave him!” Avery ordered, his voice cracking.

“No!” Manny shouted back, still dragging the man. 

He was almost there. 

Ten feet. 

Five.

Blevins laid on the trigger of the coax, the barrel starting to glow a smoky dull red.

Manny, with a final, desperate heave, got the man to the side of the tank. Avery had already popped his own hatch.

He and Blevins reached down, grabbing the civilian’s arms, while Manny pushed from below. 

They hauled the bloody, limp body into the commander’s station, bundling him in a heap on the floor behind Avery.

“Get in, Manny!”

Manny scrambled back onto the tank, slid through his hatch, and slammed it shut, sealing them back in their steel bubble.

The civilian was moaning. He was an older man, maybe in his fifties. His leg was bent at an angle that was profoundly wrong, the bone sticking out of his pants in a mess of blood and fabric. A compound fracture. He was mumbling something in a language Avery didn't recognize. Polish, maybe?

“Sarge…” Cole’s voice was barely a whisper. “Look down Broad Street.”

Avery put his eye to the CITV. His heart stopped.

A block away, something was coming. It was huge. This was no Stalker. It was the thing they’d seen on the bridge, the thing they’d all been pretending wasn’t real. 

A Juggernaut. 

It was easily thirty feet tall, a walking fortress of dark, iridescent chitin and muscle. It moved with a slow, ponderous certainty, each footstep shaking the ground, causing dust to rain down from the Abrams’ ceiling. 

It had multiple limbs, some ending in what looked like plasma cannons, others in massive, clawed fists. 

It paid no attention to the wrecked cars, simply walking over them, crushing them like tin cans with a deafening screech of tortured metal.

It was coming for them. They had rung the dinner bell, and the hungriest thing in the whole damn city had heard it.

The injured civilian in the turret began to scream, a high, thin sound of pure terror.

Outside, the Juggernaut raised one of its cannon-arms. A sickly green light began to build at the tip.

“Brace,” Avery whispered. It was the only word he could manage.

A tremendous, metallic GONG echoed through the hull as something impossibly heavy struck the front glacis plate. It wasn't a penetrating hit, but the kinetic force alone was staggering. The entire tank was shoved backwards several inches. Inside, it was chaos.

The lights flickered and died, plunging them into absolute darkness, broken only by the dim red glow of a few emergency indicators. A shower of sparks rained down from a damaged conduit. The APU sputtered, coughed, and died, and the sudden silence was more terrifying than any noise.

The wet, choked gurgle from the civilian sprawled on the turret floor, a sound that spoke of lungs filling with blood.

Over the comm, Blevins was shouting, his voice shrill with panic. ""We're dead! Oh god, we're dead!""

Avery ignored him. He was trying to get the backup systems online. His hands, slick with sweat, fumbled with the circuit breakers. Nothing.

Then came the new sound. A low, scraping, grinding noise. From the roof.

It was on top of them.

Cole’s voice, for the first time, held a note of genuine, unadulterated fear.

""Sarge. It’s trying to peel us open.""

The scraping intensified, the sound of alien claws tearing at the composite armor of the turret hatch, searching for a purchase. The sixty eight ton paperweight had become a can of food, and something very, very big was trying to get in.

The lights went out.

Darkness. Absolute and suffocating. The world inside War Pig shrank to the dimensions of a coffin packed with four terrified men and one dying one. 

The relative silence that befell the men was nauseous.

The high, terrified keening of Blevins over the internal comms. ""It's on us! It's on the goddamn roof!""

The frantic, animal scratching from directly above them. Not the random scrape of a curious claw anymore. This was methodical. A determined, grinding sound, like a giant diamond drill biting into steel. It was searching for a seam.

And beneath it all, the frantic, ragged drumming of four hearts.

""Shut up!"" Avery's voice roared through the comms, a blade of pure command cutting through the panic. 

""Blevins, shut your goddamn mouth or I will come down there and shut it for you. Sound off. Damage report. Now!""

There was a choked sob from the driver's compartment, then, ""Comms are shot. Main power is dead. I can't see a thing, Sarge. It's dark.""

""No shit, it's dark,"" 

Avery bit back, his hands flying across his control panel by touch alone. He knew every switch, every breaker, by heart. He flipped the master breaker for the main battery, then the backup. 

Nothing. The hit, while not penetrating, must have sent a shockwave through the hull that fried every delicate circuit. They were electrically dead. A two-million-dollar rock.

""Cole? Manny?""

""Gunner's here,"" Cole's voice was unnervingly steady, a low anchor in the swirling chaos. ""All my systems are black. I'm blind, TC.""

""Loader's… Loader's here,"" Manny stammered. A faint rustling came from his position. He was with the civilian. ""Sarge… the man… he's… I don't think he's breathing anymore."" The gurgling sound had stopped.

Avery felt a cold knot tighten in his gut. He had traded his crew's lives for a dead man. The thought was a shard of ice in his mind. He couldn't let it freeze him.

""Leave him,"" Avery ordered, his voice flat and devoid of emotion. ""He's gone. Focus on the problem we have right now.""

The grinding from above intensified, followed by a high-pitched metallic shriek that vibrated through their teeth. It was the sound of the turret's armor beginning to fail.

""It's getting through,"" Blevins wailed. ""It's gonna peel us open like a can of sardines!""

""Not yet, it's not,"" Avery said, his mind racing, sifting through a decade of training, through manuals he'd memorized, through contingencies for situations that were supposed to be impossible. 

Electrical failure was one thing. A thirty-foot-tall alien trying to get in was another.

There had to be a way. There was always a manual override. For everything. The gun couldn't be fired. The coax was dead. But the turret… the turret could be moved.

""Cole. Manny. The hand cranks,"" Avery said.

A moment of silence. 

The idea was insane. 

The turret weighed over twenty tons. The manual traverse and elevation cranks were a legacy system, a last-ditch feature for minor adjustments, not for combat maneuvering. Using them was a slow, back-breaking agony.

""Sarge?"" Manny's voice was incredulous. 

""That'll take forever.""

""We don't need forever,"" Avery said, a desperate, brilliant plan blooming in the darkness. 

""We just need to move it a few feet. Cole, you're on the traverse. Manny, you're on elevation with me. Blevins, you stay put and keep your mouth shut. Just listen.""

The plan was this: they were parked next to the corner of a five-story brick building. The Sophia's Boutique.

The Juggernaut was centered on their turret. If they could rotate the turret, just a few degrees to the right, they could use the building as a lever. 

They could scrape the monster off their roof. 

Or, if they were lucky, crush one of its limbs between twenty tons of steel and a hundred tons of brick and mortar.

""Okay,"" Cole said. Just one word. But in it, Avery heard acceptance. He heard trust.

""Manny?""

""Yeah… yeah, Sarge. The cranks.""

Avery felt around in the darkness for the traverse clutch lever, a heavy steel handle near the floor. 

He yanked it hard, disengaging the dead hydraulic motors from the turret ring gear. A heavy thunk echoed in the compartment. ""It's disengaged. Go.""

More fumbling in the dark. The sound of Cole finding the traverse crank, a fold-out handle that slotted into a socket near his knee. The sound of Manny finding his, the elevation crank. 

Avery found the commander's override crank next to his own seat.

""Okay,"" Cole grunted, his voice already strained. ""On three. One… two… THREE.""

A symphony of groans. The groans of tired men, and the deeper, more profound groan of the massive turret ring, forced to move by nothing more than muscle and steel gears. 

Avery put his own back into the elevation crank, his muscles screaming in protest. It was like trying to turn a building with a screwdriver.

Above them, the alien seemed to notice the shift. The grinding stopped. It was replaced by a series of heavy, rhythmic thuds. It was trying to smash its way in now. Each impact shook the hull, rattling their bones.

""It's not moving!"" Manny gasped, his breath coming in ragged pants.

""It is!"" Avery grunted back, sweat stinging his eyes. ""An inch! I felt it move an inch! Again! PUSH!""

They threw their weight into the cranks, their movements synchronized by desperation. 

The darkness was a strange blessing; they couldn't see the futility of their task, they could only feel the resistance, hear the groaning of the steel, and the thunderous impacts from above.

Scraaaape.

A new sound. The edge of the turret's bustle rack, the storage basket on the back, was making contact with the brick wall of the boutique.

""Keep going!"" Avery yelled, his voice hoarse. ""It's working!""

An alien shriek of fury erupted from directly above them. The Juggernaut knew what they were doing. 

A massive, clawed limb slammed down on the turret side, trying to arrest the movement. The impact was deafening, and the tank tilted precariously on its suspension. For a heart-stopping second, Avery thought they were going to roll.

""DON'T STOP!"" Cole bellowed, the sound ripped from his lungs. He was putting everything he had into the traverse crank, his knuckles surely bloody and raw in the dark.

The grinding of the bustle rack against the brick wall became a roar. Chunks of masonry and steel rained down on the street outside. The Juggernaut shrieked again, a sound of pain this time, not just rage. They had caught its arm.

""Now!"" Avery yelled. ""BACK THE OTHER WAY! REVERSE!""

With a synchronized groan of effort, they threw their weight in the opposite direction, reversing the cranks. 

The turret swung back to the left. 

The Juggernaut's arm, trapped between the immovable building and the irresistible force of the turret, was caught.

There was a sound that Avery would hear in his nightmares for the rest of his life. It was not a snap of bone, but the wet, fibrous, cracking sound of something immensely strong being twisted past its breaking point. 

Like a thousand giant stalks of celery being snapped at once. 

It was followed by a piercing, high-frequency scream that seemed to bypass their ears and bore directly into their brains.

The immense weight on the roof vanished.

With a final, deafening crash of metal and chitin, the Juggernaut fell from the tank, landing in a heap on the street to their right.

Silence.

No one spoke. The only sound was their own ragged, desperate breathing, echoing in the hot, dark confines of the turret.

""Did we…?"" Blevins whispered, his voice full of awe. ""Did we do it?""

Before Avery could answer, the street outside was illuminated by a blinding, sickly green light. The light poured in through the vision blocks, casting long, distorted shadows inside the compartment.

Cole, his face pressed against his own vision block, delivered the news in a dead, flat voice.

""It's on the ground. It's… getting up. Its left arm is gone. Just a mangled stump. And it is looking right at us. Sarge… the cannon on its other arm… it's glowing.""

They had won the battle. They had gotten the monster off their roof. But in doing so, they had traded a drawn-out death for a very, very quick one. 

They were still a dead tank, a rock in the middle of the road. And they had just created a very angry, one-armed Juggernaut with a plasma cannon, now standing at point-blank range.

Avery leaned his forehead against the cold steel of his cupola. He didn't say anything. There was nothing left to say. He just listened to the rising hum of the alien weapon, the sound of their own imminent vaporization. 

He had saved a man who was already dead, and he had doomed the three men who were still alive. The irony was so bitter it tasted like ash in his mouth.

He closed his eyes and waited for the light.

In that frozen, eternal second, Avery's mind, instead of shutting down, went into overdrive. 

He saw it all. 

The dead civilian on the floor. The glowing cannon. The Juggernaut, braced and ready. And beside it, the deep, structural wounds they had torn into the corner of the Sophia's Boutique.

A desperate, utterly insane thought ignited in the panic-stricken darkness of his mind. A plan born of pure, distilled hopelessness.

""Manny!"" Avery's voice was a raw bark, devoid of hope but sharp with command. ""HEAT round! Give me a HEAT round! Now!""

""Sarge, what for?"" Manny cried out, his voice cracking. ""The gun's dead!""

""We're not gonna shoot it, you idiot! We're gonna use it! Pop the loader's hatch! Get ready to push it out!""

The order was so monumentally stupid, so contrary to every regulation ever written, that for a second, nobody moved. They were going to open the hatch to the thirty-foot-tall alien that was about to kill them.

The hum from outside grew louder. The green light intensified.

""Cole!"" Avery yelled, his voice straining. ""Get your M4! Get up here! You're gonna shoot the round!""

That's when they understood. It wasn't a plan. It was a suicide pact with a sliver of a chance. A lottery ticket bought with their own lives.

Cole, the unflappable gunner, didn't question it. He simply said, ""Roger,"" and the sounds of him unstrapping his carbine from its rack were sharp and clear in the tense silence.

""Manny, MOVE!""

The command broke Manny's paralysis. He was the loader. His hands knew the ammo rack better than his own face. 

He fumbled in the dark, his fingers sliding over the smooth, cool casings of the sabot rounds until he found it. 

The M830A1 High-Explosive Anti-Tank round. It was heavier than the sabots, thick and brutish. Sixty pounds of steel, copper, and Composition B explosive. 

He wrapped his arms around it, his muscles straining as he lifted it from the rack. 

It was like hugging a bomb. Which it was.

""I got it, I got it!"" he grunted, stumbling in the dark, the dead weight of the shell throwing him off balance.

Above them, Cole scrambled up from his seat, his M4 held tight. ""I'm at the hatch, Sarge. Can't see a thing.""

""You don't have to see! You just have to hit it!"" Avery yelled. ""Manny, get the crank! Pop the hatch! Just enough to shove the round out!""

The alien cannon whined, reaching its crescendo. Any second now.

With a grunt, Manny spun the manual crank for the loader's hatch. The heavy steel plate lifted a few inches with a groan of protest, letting in a blinding slice of green light. The sound of the charging weapon flooded the tank, rattling against their eardrums.

""I'm at the hatch!"" Manny screamed over the noise, wrestling the heavy shell into the opening. ""It's… it's too heavy!""

Cole was there. He grabbed the top of the shell, his knuckles scraping against the hatch opening. Together, they manhandled the deadly cylinder, positioning it in the gap.

""It's looking at us!"" Blevins shrieked from the driver's seat. Through his own tiny periscope, he had a direct view. ""The hatch! It saw the hatch move!""

The Juggernaut, which had been focused on the turret front, began to turn its torso. The glowing cannon started to swivel towards the loader's hatch.

""NOW!"" Avery roared. ""SHOVE IT OUT!""

With a final, desperate heave, Manny and Cole pushed the HEAT round out of the hatch.

It fell, end over end, clattering onto the street below. It landed on its side on the broken pavement, a dull, inert cylinder lying directly at the base of the wounded building, just feet from the Juggernaut's massive, insectoid legs.

""Cole, shoot it! Shoot the damn thing!""

Cole leaned out of the tiny opening, his cheek pressed against the stock of his M4. He couldn't see the sights. He couldn't aim. He just pointed the barrel down and squeezed the trigger.

Click.

The sound was the loudest thing Avery had ever heard. A misfire. The round hadn't seated properly.

The Juggernaut's cannon was almost facing them. The green light pulsed, a malevolent heartbeat.

Cole didn't hesitate. He pulled the charging handle, ejecting the dud round in a single, fluid motion born of endless drills. 

The brass casing bounced off the turret roof and vanished.

He let the bolt slam forward, chambering a new round.

He fired again.

A three-round burst. The M4 barked, its frantic, high-pitched cracks a pathetic counterpoint to the alien weapon's deep hum.

For a moment, nothing happened. The shell just lay there. The Juggernaut's cannon steadied on their hatch. 

Avery squeezed his eyes shut. We failed.

A brilliant, white-hot flash from the ground.

One of Cole's 5.56mm rounds had, by a miracle of God or sheer dumb luck, struck the absurdly sensitive piezoelectric fuze in the nose of the HEAT round.

The M830A1 detonated. But it didn't just explode. It performed its function. 

The shaped charge focused the entirety of the blast into a single, cohesive jet of molten copper, a needle of incandescent plasma traveling at over 20,000 feet per second. It wasn't aimed at the Juggernaut. 

It was aimed at the building.

The molten jet struck the base of the brickwork, not with a boom, but with a hiss. It punched through the first layer of bricks as if they were water.

It vaporized mortar. It superheated the internal support beams, turning solid steel into something soft and pliable.

The building did not explode. It died.

For a split second, there was a terrible silence. Then, a groan. A deep, resonant groan, as a hundred years of brick and steel surrendered to gravity. 

The entire corner of the Sophia's Boutique, from the ground floor to the roof, sagged inwards. Cracks shot up the facade like lightning in reverse.

Then, with a sound like a mountain breaking in half, the building began to collapse.

The Juggernaut, its cannon still glowing, turned its head upwards, a gesture of what might have been surprise. It had no time to move. Tons of brick, steel I-beams, plaster, and glass descended upon it in a slow-motion avalanche.

The world inside the Abrams became a percussive nightmare. Debris hammered against the turret roof like a thousand sledgehammers. 

The tank rocked violently, throwing the men against the hard steel walls. 

The vision blocks went black as they were buried. Dust, thick and choking, poured in through the open hatch, instantly filling the compartment with an impenetrable fog.

The roar was absolute, a physical force that crushed the air from their lungs. And then, as suddenly as it began, it stopped.

Replaced by a silence that was even more profound than before. A dead silence. The silence of the tomb.

Avery coughed, his lungs on fire. The air was unbreathable, a thick soup of dust and pulverized brick. He couldn't see his own hands.

""Sound off,"" he croaked, his voice a raw whisper.

A weak cough from the gunner's station. ""Cole… I'm here. I think I swallowed a brick.""

Another, fainter cough from the loader's side. ""Manny… holy shit, Manny's here.""

A terrified, trembling voice from the front. ""Blevins. I'm okay. I think I peed. Are we dead? Is this what being dead is like?""

""We're not dead,"" Avery gasped, wiping grit from his eyes. ""We're buried.""

He forced himself to his commander's sight, but it was useless. The view was solid blackness. They were entombed.

Slowly, as the dust began to settle inside the cabin, a faint light returned. A dim, grey luminescence filtering through the still-open loader's hatch, which was now a chimney leading up through a mountain of rubble.

Cole, ever the gunner, was the first to look. He crawled over the breech of the main gun and peered up through the hatch. He stared for a long time.

""Well?"" Avery demanded, his patience gone. ""What do you see?""

Cole slid back down, his face pale and caked in grime. He looked at Avery, his eyes wide.

""I see the sky,"" he said, his voice full of a strange, hollow wonder. ""And the Juggernaut.""

""Is it dead?"" Blevins asked, his voice a hopeful squeak.

Cole shook his head slowly. ""No,"" he said, and the single word fell like a stone in the silent compartment. ""It's not dead. But it's not going anywhere, either.""

He paused, trying to find the words.

""A steel beam, a big one, an I-beam... it went through its chest. Pinned it to the ground. It's impaled. But it's still alive. It's… it's trying to pull itself free.""",18,1750005079.0,HFY,7,1.0,False

Joe Matheson had lived his entire life under the wide, wind-stroked sky of the plains. His farmhouse, battered and lonesome, stood like a solitary tooth jutting from the gums of the Earth—no close neighbors, no road but the gravel track that wound through dead grass and sunburned soil. He liked it that way. A simple life, one of chores and the soft bellow of cows, the click of fence wires, the scent of hot diesel and hay.

Then the sky opened.

It wasn’t loud. No thunder. Just a streak. A flash. The air went tight and quiet, like it had been vacuumed. Joe stood on his porch, straw hat in hand, staring at the arc of fire that dropped behind the north ridge. He knew that land like his own skin—no one lived there. Just scrub, coyotes, and rusted fences, too tired to stand.

He drove out before the sun had even set.

He never came back as Joe.

The object wasn't a rock. Not really. It had peeled back like a blooming flower, silently, revealing a hollow center filled with lights that cast no shadows. He couldn’t tell you how long he was inside. Time didn’t mean anything in there. The moment he touched the curved metallic edge, cooler than the surrounding heat should allow, he had been pulled in.

The implantation was painless.

More accurately, he was not *permitted* to feel pain.

When he awoke on the ground outside the vessel, his truck idling thirty yards off and the stars returning to their rightful places overhead, he knew two things with complete clarity: First, he had changed. Second, the thing inside his head was alive.

He didn't panic.

The implant made sure of that, dampening adrenaline and adjusting serotonin with impossible precision. The scar ran from just above his temple to the nape of his neck. His hair would eventually regrow to cover it, but for now, it gleamed slightly pink in the mirror.

He asked it—*What are you?*

The answer was not in words. It was a sensation—a pulse of understanding, followed by a flood of imagery, concepts, and raw data. The being—machine, intelligence, presence, had no language. It did not name itself, nor did it understand the boundaries between flesh and circuit. But it learned.

So did Joe.

In those first months, the changes were subtle but irreversible.

Joe could remember *everything*. Not just old birthdays or the time his brother lost a thumb to the grain thresher—but every blade of grass he passed, every cricket song, every thermal current that rippled across his skin.

His hearing sharpened. If a cow lowed in the distance, he could tune into that particular vocalization and separate it from the hum of cicadas, from the rustle of snakes in dry brush.

He could zoom in his hearing like a lens, isolating wavelengths like a conductor guiding an orchestra of noise. His vision followed. First, it became crystal sharp, then it grew, encompassing infrared, ultraviolet, and eventually into spectrums he had no names for. On moonless nights, he could see the thermal ghosts of mice beneath the barn floor.

The intelligence—*the implant*, as he began to call it—learned too. It absorbed language, culture, emotion, and physics. Joe taught it things it had never considered: how snow felt against skin. The meaning of silence between two friends. The ache of old loss. The sweetness of a dog resting its head on your lap without being asked.

Joe, the solitary farmer, became something else.

He took the name Zin.

Not a name he’d read or heard, but one that arose from a shared moment between him and the implant. A synthesis. A harmony. Zin meant *whole*, to both of them.

Zin spent the next three years studying.

He rebuilt his barn using alloys he'd synthesized in his workshop. He created energy loops and magnetic fields that rendered traditional engines obsolete. He maintained the appearance of a quiet life—rare trips into town, the occasional order from the feed store—but in truth, he had become a living node of alien knowledge.

He was not “superhuman.” He could still tire, still bleed, still need food and sleep. But within his skull lived an entire library of mathematics that would have left Einstein breathless.

And more than that, Zin began to *create*. New models of perception. New approaches to gravity and inertia. He did not publish, did not boast, did not flaunt. But he prepared.

Because the time to meet the world was coming.

It began with a signal.

The implant had remained silent on the nature of its origin until now. On a winter morning, as frost etched the inside of Zin’s windows in beautiful, fractal spirals, the implant *awoke* fully.

The signal was a call.

Not a distress beacon—but an invitation.

The intelligence had not been designed to be implanted into humans. It had not even known what a human was. The crash had been accidental—some side effect of cosmic entropy or perhaps deliberate exile. But the fusion with Joe had been unexpected and... successful.

Now others of its kind would come.

Zin knew what this meant.

If they arrived and sought to replicate the implantation, to test and modify humans like he had been altered, they would face a planet ill-equipped to respond.

He had to be the ambassador.

When he finally emerged—when Zin stepped into the world—the transformation was undeniable.

His hair had regrown. His eyes, while still blue, now shimmered slightly in light, a hint of spectrums unseen. His speech was calm, exacting, hypnotically clear. When he walked into the office of the nearest university physicist, he rewrote twelve chalkboards of equations in an hour. Then he explained quantum foam instability using a paper napkin and a coffee spoon.

He did not ask for attention. But attention found him.

Governments noticed. Agencies circled. They assumed he was the result of some clandestine experiment. Zin did not lie to them.

He told them the truth.

He had merged with a non-human intelligence. He had learned, and taught, and grown. And now, others were coming. Not to conquer, but to *observe*.

He offered humanity the gift of preparation.

Not through weapons or shields, but through understanding. Through communication. Through Zin.

There were doubters, of course. Conspiracy theorists. Skeptics. But Zin’s knowledge could not be fabricated. His insights transformed material science, propulsion, and medicine. He didn't hand out blueprints for starships. He *taught*, like a wise elder, like a farmer explaining the value of soil before handing someone a seed.

The world began to change.

One person. One intelligence. Two minds, in harmony.

Somewhere in the plains of the Midwest, where his farmhouse still stood, Zin often returned to sit on his porch, now rebuilt and reinforced with a transparent alloy that shimmered like morning dew.

He looked up at the stars. Somewhere beyond them, his other half had once come from. And now, together, they had become something new.

Not a man. Not a machine.

Where chaos is rare enough that its absence makes us restless.

like the sky's itself is unsure if it really wants to pour

Victor Stone and Garfield Logan stepped into a dark parlor. It looked like it would belong in an old-Victorian era mansion that had been completely and fully painted black. Everything was painted black or at the brightest an extremely dark grey, giving it a cramped, ominous feeling. The only splash of color were the gold lamps sitting on the coffee tables between and on the outside of couches, trying desperately to provide some light to the darkness. Vic and Gar sat on two old wood framed sofas that lined the walls, chatting about anything and everything that was coming to their minds. 

A clock on the wall ticked to 4:00 and sunlight just got low enough to peak into the room from some unseen window.  After a few moments, the door opened up and a man in a dark suit with slicked back hair walked in.

“Are you the next team of field agents? Vic and Gar?”

They stood up and Gar said, “Yeah, that’s us.”

“And just you two will be joining? Missions like these usually have more people but you mentioned that it would just be the two of you.”

Vic had just moved back to Detroit a couple of weeks ago, but Gar had wanted to come visit him for some time now and Vic wasn’t able to say no to his friend for too long. Gar had had the whole day planned out and this was one of their last stops at least as far as Vic knew. Vic hadn’t done an escape room before but Gar was something of a fanatic lately; he was doing rooms all across the country whenever he could get a day or two in between whatever he was filming these days.

“I think we’ll be able to handle it,” Gar said.

“Very well. Your mission, as you have already been partially briefed, is to find the hidden lab one of our agents uncovered and destroy any samples of the bio-weapon. Our agent was compromised before we could get additional information, but we know that he would put messages for us in the library and that the bioweapon will be destroyed if it is exposed to sunlight.” 

The man pulled out two walkie talkies from his backpack and handed one to each of them. “Use these to keep in contact with each other or with me. I will provide assistance to the best of my ability. Best of luck and godspeed.”

He opened the door behind him and gestured for Vic and Gar to go in. They stepped through and the man closed the door behind them with a thud. 

They found themselves in an ornate foyer made of dark wood with a maroon carpet lining the pathways through the room. At the fair side of the room were stairs leading to the upper floors, but after a couple of stairs on a landing was a blockade of large wooden crates, each about the size of a refrigerator, that would stop them from going further. On either side of the stairs were two large portraits of a stern looking man and woman dressed in late 1800s formal wear. Just next to the portrait of the man in the corner of the room were two wooden framed sofas on each of the walls with a large coffee table in between them. 

The room was connected to another on both the left and right. The walls on the left were only decorated with a pattern of wooden trim, but flanking either side of the ornate dark oak door were two large porcelain vases. Gar immediately walked over to them and reached inside and disappointingly walked away from them empty handed.

Vic looked around, a little overwhelmed. “I guess we should start at the library?” He suggested.

Gar nodded. “Yeah, that sounds right.” He looked back and forth between the two doors. “Neither of these really gives obvious library vibes. What do you think?”

“Guess we can split up. Just go to the other if you didn’t guess right.”

“Sounds like a plan. I’ll take the left room, you take the right?”

Vic nodded and opened up the right door, pushing through it to find himself in a kitchen. The square room’s black and white checkered floor was covered by marble topped counters and a large island with a sink in the middle. Various spice racks and pots and pans were hung on the walls in between large, floor to ceiling cabinets. A pair of free swinging doors led deeper into the house but for now Vic turned around and walked quickly to the other room.

The library was a two storied room with a large staircase in the back that led to the mezzanine level that was just above the tops of the dark wood bookshelves on the ground floor. Bookshelves lined the entire room with the exception of the space just above the stairs which was decorated with a yellowed parchment map of the world that Vic guessed was several centuries old. Some dark wood tables and chairs sat in the middle for reading with an ornate chandelier hanging down above it to light the room. 

Gar was looking around the room, investigating the bookshelves. To neither of their surprises, all of the books were to be fakes, just painted onto a board set on the shelf.

“I’m guessing one of these books is real but just searching through all of these for the one real one would take forever…” Gar mused.

“Yeah, there must be something in here to help us find it…”

Vic and Gar started to wander around the room, looking for anything out of the ordinary. But aside from the book shelves being explicitly labeled with their section of the alphabet, everything seemed normal. Sure, the books were just painted onto a piece of wood placed on the shelf, but it was done well enough that without physically running his hand across all of the “books”, he couldn’t tell the difference to find a real one. And while that would’ve worked eventually, it didn’t really feel like it was in the spirit of the escape room. 

No, aside from a full body mirror on a small metal stand, the library seemed gorgeous, but unremarkable. Vic watched the slight sway of the chandelier while he tried to think of any clues.

Then eventually it hit him. There had to be something about the map. 

He walked over to it and started to look for anything irregular. Vic would’ve admitted that geography from hundreds of years ago was hardly his forte, but he knew if there was something off there he’d be able to find it. He scanned it over and over and then finally he spotted it: a handful of countries had letters underlined in their names.

“Hey, Gar, check this out.”

Gar walked over and began searching for letters too. After a few moments, they sat at the table and compared their letters. Luckily, they matched. Unfortunately, the letters were just nonsense: nteotlcerhfateli.

Vic set his phone in the center of the table with the notes app up. He copied the letters to a new page, then started to mess with it.

“Okay, so this is probably a book title, right? And like 70% of books start with ‘the’? So let’s remove those. That leaves us with:”


    The
    neotlcerfatli



“That makes sense… Uh… other common short words…We could remove ‘of’ and ‘a’?”

Vic quickly typed in his note:


    The of a
    netlcertli


Vic and Gar stared at the “word” for a little while while they thought. Eventually, Gar saw it. 

“The word ‘center’ is in there. If we remove that we get…”


    The of a center
    ltli



“Then we’ve got ‘it’, and oh, just two ‘ls’ so it must just be: ‘The Center of it All’!” Gar said.

Vic and Gar walked around the library until they found where it’d be on the shelf and grabbed the small black book off of it and set it on the table. They flipped it open and an envelope with a letter inside was tucked in the cover. It was written in a typewriter style font and read:

“Lab is under the manor. Bring sunlight to the paintings in the foyer and it will reveal the way.”

“Okay, so I guess we just need to open up some windows in there to win?” Gar said.

Vic shook his head. “I don’t remember there being any windows in there. Or here. Or in the kitchen I went into. So there’s got to be something else to it. Guess we can just keep looking around?”

“Sounds good. Did you see anything in the kitchen that seemed important while you were there?” 

“Not really. But I didn’t look too closely and wasn’t in there for very long.”

“Well, let’s see what we find.”

Vic grabbed the envelope and put it in his pocket before leaving just in case. He didn’t think it’d be useful for anything but he couldn’t be sure.

Once they were back in the kitchen, they started to dig around for whatever they could find. Vic immediately went to the big cabinets but the door handles were padlocked together. The other large cabinet, as well as the one under the sink, were similarly locked but the kitchen drawers were not and in one of them Vic found a short hand written note. 

“Cabinets have been locked to restrict access to kitchen materials due to use on personal projects. A reminder that the kitchen is for work use ONLY. You can find the key in the library in the book that shares my name.

Thanks,

Management”

“Alright, well, we’ve got to look for another book at some point. Not sure why we’d need something in there yet, but I’m sure it’ll be useful eventually.”

Gar nodded. “I didn’t really see anything in the spice racks or with the pots. So I guess we keep moving.”

The guys left the kitchen through the double doors into the dining room, which had unfortunately seen better days. The room was set up for a feast with a massive black dining table spanning the length of the room with chairs and red place mats evenly spaced throughout it. Or at least it would’ve been, if not for the back half of the room having completely collapsed. Wooden beams smashed the table in two and the rubble from the floor above stopped them from going further in. Paintings of ancient seas of trees lined the walls, except for one spot just to the right of the door that had a china cabinet full of expensive looking vases and plates.

Gar whistled. “Wow, they really went all out on the set of this one.”

“Yeah, this place has been really well designed. I didn’t expect them to go this all out on the theme but it’s been amazing.”

“Would I lead you astray? I’ve always got the best spots,” Gar beamed.

“Except for that one time in Metropolis when…”

“Okay, okay, but that one doesn’t count. Even the pros make a mistake sometimes.”

They laughed.

“Hey, what’s that?” Gar pointed at something on the floor just before the pile of rubble and walked over to it. He bent over and picked it up.

“Charlotte Webber, Kitchen Manager. Well, there’s our name. I’ll go grab that key if you want to look around here for a bit.”

“Sounds like a plan.”

Gar headed off while Vic started to focus up. He started with the dining room table, looking under the place mats and chairs and the table itself for any hidden messages or notes without luck. He scanned the paintings and took them off their hangers to no avail. Finally, he went over to the china cabinet and opened it up. None of the vases or plates had anything written on or in them and so he closed it back up. As he closed the doors with a bit more force than required, the entire cabinet slid just a little bit. He looked down at the floor and, subtly in the wood flooring, was a little track for the cabinet to slide. But it was filled with gunk and dirt. They had a use for the cleaning supplies after all.

He did another quick look around to make sure he didn’t miss anything for a few moments before Gar was back. 

“Got the key?”

“Yeah, any idea why we need it?”

Vic gestured to the cabinet. “It’s on a rail but it’s stuck. If we grease it or clean it or something we can get behind it.”

“Gotcha, let’s take a look then.”

They walked back into the kitchen and Gar swiftly unlocked the locks for the two cabinets and the one under the sink. The two large cabinets each had a full body mirror in them and as expected, there was some grease below the sink and a brush to apply it.

Gar grabbed the grease can and went back into the dining room with Vic right behind him. With a quick dab of grease, the china cabinet moved with ease, revealing a window behind it. Sunlight shone into the room and for the first time in a while, Vic realized just how dim it had been in this place as the light visibly cut through the darkness. 

Vic frowned for a moment. They had their light, but how were they supposed to take it…. The mirrors.

“Gar, grab one of the mirrors and I'll grab the other. If we angle it right, we should be able to shine them into the foyer and get to the lab.”

His eyes lit up with realization. “Oh! And that’s what the walkie talkies are for. That way we can better talk about what angles we need.”

“Alright, I’ll head back to the foyer, you set this one up.”

Gar nodded and the two of them headed into the kitchen and dragged the two mirrors from the cabinets. It was heavier than Vic expected but with some work he managed to get it into the foyer.

He tapped the button on the walkie talkie. “Gar, you in position?”

“Yup, you see the beam?”

“Not yet, no. Gotta get just the right angle to get it through the kitchen.”

“Alright, I’m going to move it around for a bit. Let me know when you can see it.”

Vic wasn’t sure exactly what angle the beam would be coming in from, but he figured he might as well try and line it up while he waited. He lined it up to the portrait of the woman at first but then changed it to the one of the man as he thought the angle was too steep for it to work with her painting.

Then, the light shined into the room about 10 feet away from where he guessed it’d be.

“Stop! That’s about right!”  Vic said over the walkie talkie. 

“Sounds good. Your turn then.”

Vic picked up his mirror and, doing his best to hold the approximate angle, lined it up with the beam. The beam was far off at first, but with a little adjustment, it hit the painting dead on. 

At first, nothing happened and he thought that they somehow misunderstood the puzzle. Seeing it now, he was 100% sure the light wouldn’t be able to be angled towards the woman without some big adjustments and thankfully before he started to try and make them, the painting of the man slid downwards into the floor, revealing a path downwards.

“Gar, come check this out!”

Gar jogged over and the two of them headed down into the basement.  

The dark vibes of the manor quickly gave way to a sterile white staircase with white walls and white tiled floors that led deeper underground. It was still poorly lit as the beam of sunlight guided them forwards. As they walked down, Vic noticed that a few bits of glass were strategically placed in the ceiling and tiles to change the trajectory of the sunlight to go downwards with them.

Finally, they had reached it. They were in a wide open room with a white door on each of the walls that lead to other chambers, but all of them were locked. In the center of the room on a glass pedestal was a big glass tube full of a green liquid. They’d made it. But the sunlight had not. It was illuminating a small part of the wall in the back part of the room as the dim fluorescent lights kept the area just above pitch black.

Vic frowned. They’d need a mirror, but they were already using both of them. Then he remembered the mirror in the library. That’d do it. 

“Gar, I’m running to the library to grab the mirror. Be right back.”

It was a quick jog there and back to get the mirror and thankfully, aligning this last one was easy since he could see the end goal. Once the sunlight was pointed at the vial, it started to turn darker and darker in color until it turned a nice shade of navy blue.

The lights came on full blast and a little celebratory tune played from unseeable speakers.

“Congratulations agents! You’ve neutralized the virus and saved the world!” The man from the start said. “I’ve unlocked the door in the back of the room, use that to escape and I’ll meet you on the other side!”

Vic and Gar gave each other a loud high five. “Nice job man!”

“Yeah, you too! This was a ton of fun.”

“I’ll find another one for next time, you should see what people have come up with, it’s crazy!”

“Sounds great! But let’s get their stuff back so they can get it ready for the next people.”


Gar nodded and walked through the door at the end of the room. The man was standing there with a warm smile on his face. 

“You guys have a good time?”

“Yeah, it was great,” Vic said, handing him his walkie talkie and the envelope from the library.

“Same, this one has to be one of my favorites I’ve done,” Gar said, doing the same.

“Great to hear. I designed this one myself after seeing some disappointing ones so I love the feedback. Thanks for coming guys and have a good rest of your day! Just take the stairs up and you’ll be back at street level.”


“Great, thanks again!” Vic said, heading up the stairs back to the real world.

⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙ ⚙

The sun was still shining bright as they left the building and started to walk down the sidewalk. 

“So, where to next on your “tour” of the city?”

Gar pulled out his phone and checked his calendar. “I’ve got a reservation at a pizza place a couple blocks from here, then we’re free for whatever.”

“Sounds great, what are you think-”

A beam of light shined down from the sky and Vic started to turn transparent. Confusion ran across Vic’s face as he stepped aside and the beam tracked him perfectly. He started to run down the street and Gar and the beam chased after him. Vic started to turn more and more transparent and Gar decided that wherever Vic was going, he would go too. 

He shapeshifted into a mouse and jumped into Vic’s pocket before the two of them were whisked away into the unknown.

In the group is also formed by my bf and my male best friend, who like me are heavy cannabis smokers. My bf and friend smoke for fun, they dont like alcool anymore and think it’s toxic, while cannabis is a little lighter; meanwhile, i smoke for psicologycal necessites. I dont want to share details, but i got a really difficult life and i always had to have my back on my own (sorry for my english i hope you can still get what i want to say), and after years whitout acces to therapy i stared smooking to relax; i know i’m not a doctor who have the capacity to give medication, but fuck i need to survive. I have to add that me and my bf live in a different city from the others, and this year i moved to another city (not that far but still far) to continue my education; this really got my psicological state and i started having more breakdowns and deppressing episodes, so i increased the dose during the day but also stared coming more to visit my friends and i stared therapy. 

My friend Maya has never has issues with cannabis, she always told us that she is not interessed into smooking it but is not against it, and she also smoked cannabis a few times with us or just me when we went to Greece (it was legal back then) and smoked the cannabis that i grown; but she always told us that she was scared that her father, a police man, might find out that we smoke (in my country is still illegal) and this will effect him. We assured her that we will never smoke before seeing him or near their house, but we will keep smooking outside because if they catch us it’s on us and not her. Also, Maya had a psychosis 4 years ago and since then she kept saying that she sees/hear/remember things differently, and that she can’t remember if she dreamed about something or it was real.

Last month Maya had to pass a heavy exam and she told us she would not respond to anyone for a month, i thought thats fine you need your time and energy, but Sofia came to us and told us that Maya had something going us with us but she couldn’t tell us; i was so shocked because i’m usually that girl in the group that you go to when you need advice or help, but i understood that if i’m part of the problem you can’t come to me for advice, so i waited for her, but one day i found a tiktok comment that changed everything: in my country it has just passed a law that says that if u are a cannabis smoker you can’t ride anything, even if you have smoked 3 months before, and they will get your license; one day under a tiktok videos about this law I saw a Maya’s comment that litterary says “I dont care if it’s passed three month, get them all!” And there i understood what the problem was. I didnt confront her right away, i thought that when she had passed her exam we would have be able to discuss this with love and touch as we always did. 

But the day after her exam the three of us went to to a coffee and Maya was extremly aggressive and looking at me with disgust, we didn’t talk about cannabis, but when i came back home i just started crying, so i called Sofia and asked what to do, and she said i should ask Maya how she feels (not about the cannabis, just in general). I did, and Maya responded with a long paragraph about our issue with cannabis, and the fact that we should see eachother less. 

The chat went long and i cant say everything we said, but at the end i realized that she was not asking us to smoke less near her, but that she wanted to see us less because we are cannabis smokers; also she told me that i’m actually depressed for the cannabis and not my past, that i’m not a good friend because one night in greece she followed me at 3 am in the street because i was looking for some grams and she was scared i might find someone dangerous. 

But…it never happened :( I even asked our friends that where there if i dont remember this, but they told me the only time we went out it was to get some drinks and her cigarettes, and that i choose to follow her;  how can she say that i’m not depressed for my past while the last 3 years i have been beated, m0Iested and live like Cinderella for a family of hikikomoris? I realised that maybe her mind was creating a different story for my character in her head, and most of our friends that knows us think the same. 

At the end  i told her it was best to complety end our friendship because i’m also in not a good mental state and i can’t go out with friends who look at me with disgust, but at the same time i’m exausted because a lost one of my best friend. I just miss her, i see something and just know it will be perfect for/on her, but i can’t do it right now. I talked to my therapist and she said that it’s ok to not be friend with someone who hasn’t your political opinion, but was this actually a political thing? Or a respect thing? Also i want to add that i’m allergic to tabacco, and Maya is a heavy smoker (2 pack per day so like 50 sigarettes) and i ofted asked her to not smoke near me but she did it anyway ( i even puked a lot of times due to this) because we were in a open place, so i did the same with cannabis.

Should I try talk to her in the future or it will not be positive for my life? So, AITA for choosing cannabis and my mental state over my best friend?",1,1750004713.0,AITAH,4,0.66,False

Before AI, tech used to be a dream. I remember when twitter workers would brag about free coffee, free food, relax rooms, game rooms. Work in tech was chill. Working at faang was like the big goal for everyone.

Computer science was the top major in college cause people wanted to work at facebook or make the next facebook and get rich.

But now in 2025 things changed a lot. Tech is seen as one of the worst choices. Entry level jobs are super hard to get. Even top college students compete with thousands of others. Plus no job security at all. Companies do performance reviews and if they don’t like your results you might get fired. And AI made things worse by boosting productivity so companies lay off even more. Some ceos literally say mid level engineers will be gone in 2 years.

Even top senior engineers are getting laid off. A lot of work is being sent to india.

Tech is a mess now. Who in 2025 wants to go to college and study computer science. It's over. Tech is dead. Too risky now with AI moving so fast and companies wanting less engineers.

Starting your own product is hard too. Like making your own app or startup. Too much competition and most people make little to nothing.

So who even wants to go into tech anymore?

Government jobs seem way more stable. Stuff like medicine, dentistry, or nursing. Yeah it’s hard work but at least you know you’ll have a job and money.

Tech? No way. You can work hard, have experience, be really smart, solve tough problems, and still be out of a job. Imagine being in your 40s with tons of knowledge and no one wants to hire you. Total disaster. People thought they’d be set for life but ended up with nothing.

It feels like a scam. People spent years learning and studying only for the whole job market to dry up. Companies just stopped hiring cause they have AI now.

Why would any smart person go into tech? Being a mcdonald’s worker is more stable and better for your mental health honestly.

How is AI supposed to keep growing if no one wants to learn computer science anymore?

Even facebook said they can't find top AI talent. Well no wonder. Why would anyone study tech just to get thrown out later? You help them build AI and then they fire you. They don’t want to share profits with workers.

Instead of spending 20 years learning computer science and solving hard math problems just to be unemployed, it makes more sense to study something safe like law or dentistry. Something AI can't take so easily.

Tech jobs have no future anymore. And if people stop going into tech, then yeah AI progress might actually slow down. Cause who wants to spend their life on something that ends with getting laid off?

I’m a 22 year-old guy based in London, and I’m here to build real, long-term friendships - the kind that ideally includes meeting up in person eventually. I think it’s hard to form genuine bonds without shared experiences beyond a screen.

If you're just messaging out of boredom or likely to ghost after a day, feel free to skip this post as I’m looking for meaningful connections, not quick chats.

Who I’m hoping to connect with:

Aged 18–26

Based in the UK (even better if you’re also in London or nearby)

Open to eventually meeting in person - whether it’s for coffee, concerts, or just to hang out


A bit about me:

⚽ Football fan — I play weekly

🤘 Big into rock & metal — always down for gigs

🎮 Gamer — mostly into single-player games across genres

🎬 Into Marvel and all things nerdy

🏎️ I love go-karting and visiting theme parks

🧠 Neurodivergent — emotionally aware, open-minded, and a good listener

What I’m not looking for:

One-word replies

Inconsistent or low-effort conversations

Surface-level chats with no intention of building something real

What I am looking for:

People who want real connection and are willing to put in effort

Comfortable with chatting regularly, maybe gaming or voice calling

Open to hanging out or doing things in person down the line

If you’re messaging me, please include your age, gender, location, and a bit about yourself, just to show you actually read this and want to connect.

Thanks for reading.

I’d really like to meet a few solid, like-minded people.",1,1750004441.0,MeetPeople,0,1.0,False

I spent most of my life in New York and am just tired of it. The cost, the crowds, the dirtiness. When I was younger I thrived on it but now i hate every day here.

From 2021-2023 I hoofed it to Tulsa as part of their remote worker incentive program. I loved the slower vibe, cost of living, open space, etc.

Ultimately tulsa is a little too small. (There’s one gay bar and zero walkability.)

I visited KC a few times and liked that it was bigger without being BIGGER. It’s close enough to tulsa I can visit my friends but also near other cities if I want to explore. The cost of living for me is great.

I know KC is not NY or Chicago. I absolutely don’t want it to be. But I do want some urban feel — neighborhoods, funky coffee bars, a food scene etc. people from all over.

It should boldly reflect who you are.

For me I reject the popular ""modern look"" that makes a home feel sterilised. It's a very kenyan airbnb look, you know that chanel and Gucci books (wtf is even that for???) The fake marble coffee table, the grey sofas, THE FAKE PLANTS!!!!! ( I hate fake plants so much), the eames chairs.

I like a home that looks like it has life in it, there is flow of energy. There's little and not so little trinkets that give a little history about you and what you represent.

For me the clay pot is an addition I'd like to have to my house. Having grown up in the coast there's very few things that were as refreshing as a cup of water from the clay pot. You instantly felt hydrated and recharged after a tasking day in the heat. I want to bring back that feeling and it's also a great piece for conversation when you have guests.

But now my cortisol is borderline normal. For context, I used to only need to go 3-4x a day. 5-7 max if I went drinking (like 2+ bottles of soju mix with other alcohol or 3/4 hard liquor mixed with other drinks).

Initially thought the frequent urination might be a UTI, but only 1/4 doctors said it was, and 3 rounds of antibiotics did not help. It improved but I’m still going like 10+ times a day. For context I don’t drink a lot now. Maybe one cup of matcha and 400 ml water. I cut coffee out bc I read it’s an irritant. However, when I was living on my own abroad , I could drink like 2 cups of coffee, sometimes 3 or a cup of tea + half cup apple juice, half bottle of water, 1 bottle of Diet Coke, vitamin c at night and yet only need to go toilet <5x a day if alcohol is not involved. I even did an ultrasound which showed nothings wrong.

However, my insulin growth like factor is at 311, above  the normal range. My doc didn’t check this at my most recent check up Is my increased urination normal due to normal cortisol now (I read low cortisol can result in decreased urination too which might have been why I didn’t have to use the toilet so much? (I’m sure 15 times isn’t tho) or is it a sign of diabetes. I will be asking my doc in a few months but would just like to ask in the mean time.
