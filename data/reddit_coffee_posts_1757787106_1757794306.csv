I‚Äôll be in Stockholm for a bit this November and was wondering if it‚Äôs worth trying to sneak a ride in while I‚Äôm there. Back home I‚Äôve been documenting my journey into gravel/road cycling (coming from a BMX and MTB background), and it would be rad to keep that rolling while traveling in Sweden! 

Couple things I‚Äôm curious about:

* Do people still ride outside in November, or is it mostly indoor training season?
* Any good city or gravel routes worth checking out that time of year?
* And if anyone here is down to meet up for a spin (or even just coffee + bike talk), I‚Äôd be stoked to connect!

I love meeting rad people through riding, and I'm thinking maybe I‚Äôll even make a little video around the experience! ",0,1757794129.0,sweden,1,0.5,False

1ng7eos,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnRussian/comments/1ng7eos/apps_i_use_to_study_russian_from_zero/,Apps I use to study Russian from zero,"When I started learning Russian, I wanted apps that felt light, fun, and actually helpful. Here are the ones I use daily for both conversations and TORFL prep:

**Conversation ‚Äì Chickytutor, HelloTalk**

Speaking is always the scariest part when starting a new language. I use Chickytutor to practice speaking sentences whenever I feel like it. It's nice because I don't have to be shy or worry about mistakes with pronunciation. Then I go to HelloTalk when I want to talk with real people. Sometimes I exchange simple phrases about weather or food, sometimes we discuss Russian literature or films. Both apps make it easy to practice without too much pressure.

**Cyrillic Script ‚Äì Russian Alphabet Mastery**

Learning Cyrillic felt like decoding secret messages at first, but Russian Alphabet Mastery made it systematic. The app teaches each letter with clear pronunciation and handwriting practice. What I love most is how it groups similar-looking letters and explains the differences. After just one week of daily practice, I could read Russian words even if I didn't understand them yet. The app includes cursive Russian too, which looks completely different from print. I practice for 10 minutes each morning, and now reading Cyrillic feels as natural as Latin script.

**Vocabulary & Cases ‚Äì Drops Russian**

Russian vocabulary with its six cases seemed overwhelming, but Drops made it visual and manageable. The 5-minute sessions with beautiful illustrations help words stick in memory. What I love most is how it introduces words in different cases naturally, without making it feel like grammar study. At first, I couldn't understand why words kept changing endings, but seeing patterns visually really helps. I practice during coffee breaks, and slowly my vocabulary has expanded beyond basic tourist phrases. The pronunciation practice with native audio is essential for those soft and hard consonants.

**Grammar & Cases ‚Äì Russian Cases Interactive**

When Russian cases drove me to confusion, this app saved my understanding. It turns learning cases into interactive exercises where you see exactly why each case is used. What's brilliant is the color coding system and real-life examples for each case. After weeks of practice, I started intuitively knowing when to use genitive versus accusative. The app explains motion verbs clearly too - finally understanding the difference between –∏–¥—Ç–∏ and –µ—Ö–∞—Ç—å was a breakthrough. Five minutes daily has made Russian grammar feel logical rather than random.

**TORFL Preparation ‚Äì Pushkin Institute Online**

When I wanted to get serious about TORFL (Test of Russian as a Foreign Language) certification, the Pushkin Institute's online platform became invaluable. They provide official preparation materials for all levels from A1 to C2. I like how they break down exactly what vocabulary, grammar, and cultural knowledge each level requires. The practice tests mirror the actual exam format perfectly. Working through their exercises daily keeps me focused on systematic progress rather than random learning.

**Dictionary ‚Äì Multitran**

A good dictionary is always needed, and for Russian I use Multitran. It's incredibly comprehensive with context from real texts, not just translations. What makes it special is the forum discussions where native speakers explain nuances between similar words. Russian has many words that seem synonymous but aren't, and Multitran clarifies these differences. The example sentences from literature and news show authentic usage. I also like how it includes slang and colloquial expressions with warnings about formality levels.

**Reading ‚Äì RT Learn Russian**

To improve my reading, I use RT Learn Russian section daily. They provide news articles with three difficulty levels and built-in translation support. What's helpful is the hover dictionary - I can check words without leaving the article. I start with elementary level articles about culture and lifestyle, then challenge myself with intermediate content. At first, every sentence required multiple lookups, but after some months I could read simple articles without constantly checking words. It's a nice way to practice reading while learning about Russian perspectives on various topics.

**YouTube ‚Äì Listening & Review**

I also use YouTube as part of my learning routine. There are so many channels where you can listen to natural Russian conversations, learn grammar, or review pronunciation. I sometimes watch Russian vloggers like –≤–î—É–¥—å or –Æ—Ä–∏–π –î—É–¥—å with Russian subtitles, sometimes structured lessons from Be Fluent in Russian or Russian with Max, depending on my mood. Russian subtitles help me connect the spoken sounds with Cyrillic text, which improves both my listening and reading simultaneously. It feels less like studying and more like browsing YouTube normally, but I still pick up colloquial expressions and modern Russian slang every time I watch.",1,1757794097.0,LearnRussian,0,1.0,False

1ng7dmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/1ng7dmc/heels_on_the_tiles/,Heels on the tiles,"I went back to my hometown after 10 years to take care of some paperwork. 

35 years. That's how long I've been a man. I went back to the biggest (main) pharmacy of the town. I didn't have the keys to my parents house where I was staying so I went there to pass the time. I noticed the make up aisle, i had never spared a glance before. But today, something shifted. Maybe it was the ""vacation"", a break from the routine that felt more like a costume. Or maybe it was just time.

I stopped in front of the makeup, rows and rows of colors and textures, each promising a kind of transformation I'd considered only in fantasy. My fingers brushed against a bottle of foundation, cool and smooth. What would it feel like, to cover this rough skin, to smooth out the edges of a life that never quite fit? How would my eyes look with longer lashes? 
A wave of something like grief washed over me. All those years, playing the part of a man, the colorless clothes, the boring shoes, the provider role. Was this what life was supposed to be? A series of manly rules, none of them truly mine?

""Can I help you, SIR?"", a pharmacy employee said, and I flinched, pulling back from the display ""no, thank you"" I shyly said. A woman walked past, her heels clicking on the tile, and for a moment, I imagined myself in her shoes. It wasn't about the makeup, not really. It was about the possibility of something else, something real. A life full of color, beauty, sorority, happiness. 

The familiar feeling of feeling uncomfortable in my clothes came back again. I hate baggy clothes, I felt dumb in my button up shirt and man pants. I feel like I'm cosplaying a boring person, but on the outside I'm just a regular dude. Just like all the others. Fading in the background. 

I come back to my parents house. My loving wife greets me with a hug. She was having coffee with my mom. They were talking about how much of a good MAN I was. How much they are proud of me for being a good rolemodel to my little brother and younger (male) cousins... If only they knew, I was thinking about not the woman, but sound the heels on the tiles...

I thought it did at one point and slipped out but now it doesn't go in at all so I may have hallucinated that. We are trying to work through the possible problems in order of easiest/cheapest up to ""not a chance that I can do it myself/takes thousands of dollars"". 

Some details:  
\* The Tahoe had a code for the mass airflow sensor. We replaced the air filter and cleaned the sensor really good. The code went away for a couple days but now the check engine light comes on intermittently. Unfortunately it's never on when we get anywhere that can check it, so not sure if it's the same or different now.  
\* The transmission oil cooler line had popped off because it needed a new black ring connector thing and a new piece that screws into the radiator side. (Sorry, I am not good with remembering the specific names of things.) We got it fixed and there's no problem with that anymore. Not even a teeny drip.  
\* We've changed the transmission filter and completely refilled with brand new fluid. No leaks.  
\* When changing the transmission filter the fluid was quite dirty but nothing that looked like coffee grounds or sludge, no metallic flakes, nothing like that. BUT there were PEBBLES in the pan. I rinsed them off and checked them over and over. Legit ROCKS. Figure that's not good, but it wasn't clutch material.

  
We were going to try changing the solenoids (which is a whole different question... like, which solenoids? I've heard there's shift A and shift B and an EPC that could be causing the problems? But no one at the auto parts store knows what I'm talking about and they have no idea what I need either. Anyway.... moving on...) but then someone said we should instead try checking and cleaning the transmission harness and main connector. We're having a hard time finding out exactly where it is though. The person who suggested that I do this said it's on the outside of the transmission pan but then someone else said you do have to remove the pan. I'm just confused. How do I do this on a 4L60E transmission? Can someone please walk me through it like I know nothing about working on a car?

I was never protected from abuse or pain. I just need a person who would be a safe person to talk with and to be friends, who wouldn't hurt me. 

Fun/Weird fact: I was diagnosed with agoraphobia, which means....I cannot leave my house. When I do, it causes me to have a major panic attack, until I start vomiting or passing out. I force myself to get out once or twice a week. But I am always home! It isn't a life for me, but with my illness, and plus my disorder. It prevents me from leaving the house. 

Second fun fact: I used to be in school for nursing.

Third fun fact: I am CPR, first aid certified. 

Fourth fun fact: I have two babies that are 9 months apart. 

Fun fact: I can hack into about anything. And enjoy fixing on electronics on my free time. 

Fun fact: I made a 4.0 in college, made only A's and B's. Even was on the deans list, and was invited to this program to meet special people and for a rewards. (You can only go, if you are invited and I was invited because of my grades)

Fun fact: I write like this, because my brain is different. I am not a robot. Even though, I used to work with AI. 

Fun fact: My eyes change colors with every mood. 

Fun fact: I will always put others first, before myself. I will go out my way, to making sure someone is happy and healthy even If I am not. I love humans, nothing can change that. 

Fun fact: I have been single for 2 years, I used to be a wify, but he lefty me. I was abused mentally, verbally and physically. I haven't actually been on a date in 2 years. 

Fun fact: I love to cook, bake and clean! Just a passion for me. 

Fun fact: I have been sick for my whole life. I was born not breathing, so I still go once or twice a month for steroids. I was diagnosed with chronic ill in 2024, but have been through many doctors for a diagnosis. I was sick my whole life, never had a childhood (well, because of that and trauma) because I am always too sick or hospitalized for it. 

Fun fact: I used to own a snake named Kitty, a bearded dragon named Remi. (And yes, I am an anime person, I love watching anime)

Fun fact: I love to draw on my free time, if I am up to it. I mainly draw anime, or cartoons! I do turn them into stenciling for tattooing. 

Fun fact: I am a horror fanatic, I love anything with horror. I enjoy reading horror books as well. 

Fun fact: I can deepen my voice in a funny way. 

Fun fact: I was in karate for 10 years, been in tournemnts, won trophies. So yes, I know how to fight. 

Fun fact: I am a Christian, so I used to go to tournaments for that. It was actually fun, so it trained my brain to be very quick. 

Fun fact: I have been diagnosed with a lot of mental issues, because of my trauma. But I use sense of humor as a coping mechanism. 

Fun fact: I have been drinking coffee since I was 8 years old. 

Fun fact: I used to be athletic, so I can do backbends, flips, kart wheels, splits. 

Fun fact: I used to do tap dancing and ballet. Even was in the newspaper before ~

Fun fact: I used to play guitar, piano and the trumpet for many many years. 

Fun fact: I have a twin sister. We are identical. 

Fun fact: I am full of pain and trauma, but I never allowed that to turn me into a mean and hateful person. I turn it into compassion for other people. You cannot hurt me, I grew up being hurt by my own family. My mom never protected me, my dad was always a drunk. 


These Fun facts are just facts, some fun, some not. I just liked the term ""fun"". 



I am chronically ill, and I am in a flare up. I need people that can be my friend and safe place to go too. But I am struggling with a flare up today, ans it is miserable. distract me! Send me memes or jokes. Or let's start a friendship

Hi! My name is Courtney! (Coco or Cocopuff is my nicknames.) I am in my 20's, from the United States. I am part Irish, part Scottish with a hint of autism.

1ng788i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ng788i,SoloTravel to Vietnam - A quest to find myself.,"This was my first international solo trip, planned just a month before. I have traveled alone in India before, but this journey was different.

I didn‚Äôt want to follow the usual tourist path. My purpose was to push myself‚Äîto step beyond my introvert nature, build more confidence, and learn to feel comfortable in a crowd. I wanted to observe people, connect with them with a smile, discover local culture and food, learn to eat with chopsticks, and try to capture it all with my camera. I‚Äôm still new to photography, so I hope you‚Äôll review my photos.

Traveling during the off-season made everything more special. The places were quiet and less crowded, which made talking to locals easier. Hostels, food, and beer were cheap, and the only real challenge was the high humidity in Danang.

My favorite memory was the last day in Hanoi‚Äîwandering through the city all night with a local friend, finding a place to drink beer at 4 AM, and finishing the adventure with famous egg coffee in the morning.

I didn‚Äôt have any itinerary. I chose where and when to go the day before, booking a bus or flight whenever I felt ready to move. The whole trip cost around 80,000 INR. If you visit Vietnam, don‚Äôt miss Ninh Binh and Da Nang. The transportation is not that cheap. Flights are expensive if you book a day before and also need to pay extra for luggage. I stayed in hostel (mad monkey Hanoi is my fav)

Next destination: Japan.

Footnote: The cities in Vietnam are impressively clean and well-planned, with proper lane markings and footpaths everywhere. I explored every corner of Hanoi and HCMC on a scooter. Honestly, no city in India can match them. Corruption runs deep in India, and we focus on building fancy airports instead of fixing things that matter for everyone.",2,1757793641.0,SoloTravel_India,2,1.0,False
1ng786l,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSleepAuthors/comments/1ng786l/i_need_some_feedback_on_my_story/,I need some feedback on my story.,"This one is the first installment of a series.



**My mother got me into a monster fight club.**



I‚Äôm still not sure about this, but I have to put it somewhere. I can‚Äôt tell anyone in my real life; they‚Äôd either ask who my dealer is or call a psych ward before I finished the story.



One of the guys I train with sent me here. He swears he once saw Bigfoot stealing food from his grandma‚Äôs backyard. (Probably just a very hairy hobo, but whatever.) He said people on this site don‚Äôt laugh you out of the room. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here.



For the record: my life was never exactly ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù I‚Äôll explain that. But things only started to spiral out of control about two weeks ago.



Call me Max. Obviously, it‚Äôs not my real name. I'm 19 years old, and live in Budapest, Hungary. I‚Äôve been training in martial arts as long as I can remember. My earliest memory is sitting cross-legged on the carpet, watching an old kung fu movie, the kind where the fighters had techniques that looked more like superpowers than something you could learn. I guess that stuck with me.



My mom runs an MMA gym, so when I asked to train, she didn‚Äôt hesitate to sign me up. She never pushed  (asked more than once if I wanted to try something else), but I already knew this was mine. Fighting fascinated me more than anything.



Two weeks ago, at the end of a session, I was sparring with some regulars in Mom's gym. My opponent was a mountain of a man, twice my size. I dodged a kick, grabbed his leg and‚Ä¶ lifted him clean off the ground.



Anyone watching could tell I shouldn‚Äôt have been able to do that. Even though I‚Äôm not a dwarf or a living skeleton, I‚Äôm definitely not tall or bulky either. My height is average at best, but most people I meet are usually taller by at least half a head. 



Back to the match. I spun and tossed him out of the ring. Mom shot me that sharp look she uses, the one that means keep it together. She‚Äôs the only person who knows that certain thing about me, and she‚Äôs always warning me to keep myself under control.



After everyone left, I waited for her to finish paperwork. I‚Äôd skipped breakfast, and my stomach was gnawing. I scraped together some change and fed it into the vending machine for a protein bar. Of course the bar jammed halfway down.



I checked the room (nobody around) and pressed my palm to the glass. The bar twitched, slid loose, and dropped into the tray. For a second, it hovered an inch above my hand, like it was pinned there by invisible threads. Then I grabbed it.



As you can guess by now, yes, I have telekinesis. But don‚Äôt picture anything big. No exploding heads or hurling cars across parking lots, just floating small objects. Touch is where it gets‚Ä¶ different. 



Remember the fight earlier? I used my power on that guy. No, it wasn‚Äôt super strength; I don‚Äôt get stronger. The object I touch gets lighter. The heavier it is, the shorter the effect lasts.



I didn‚Äôt discover it in any epic or dramatic way. I found out as a kid, trying to lift a garden gnome while helping Mom. One moment it was normal, in the next it was weightless. Now I know that a four-year-old's skull is harder than a garden gnome. 



If you‚Äôre skeptical (and you should be), fair. But if you don‚Äôt believe me, then maybe stop reading here, because things are about to get even weirder.



‚ÄúStealing from the vending machine with telekinesis? You‚Äôre the lamest super-villain I‚Äôve ever seen,‚Äù Mom called from the doorway of her office. She‚Äôd always known about my ability.



‚ÄúI paid for it. It got stuck,‚Äù I said, chewing.



‚ÄúAnyway, come into my office. We need to talk.‚Äù



On her desk sat the aforementioned garden gnome, glued back together, looking innocent, like it had never tried to murder me.



The next thing I remember after walking into her office is waking up in a place I didn‚Äôt recognize.



Something hard pressed into my back. My head throbbed, my vision fuzzed and the room spun. When I managed to sit up, the world cleared enough to see I was on a bench in a locker room. Not Mom‚Äôs gym locker room, this was different.



A door opened and closed. I braced for the worst. I didn‚Äôt expect my mother to walk in, smiling like everything was normal.



‚ÄúGood morning, sleepyhead,‚Äù she said.



‚ÄúMom? What the hell happened?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the last thing you remember?‚Äù she asked, calm as if this were a casual conversation over coffee.



‚ÄúYou called me into your office. Then blackout.‚Äù



‚ÄúOh, maybe Claude gave you too much of that stuff,‚Äù she mused as she sat beside me. ‚ÄúAnyhow, I told you before: you‚Äôre not the only unusual person in the world.‚Äù



‚ÄúI know. You‚Äôve said that before.‚Äù



She never clarified, just told me not to feel like a freak because there were others. 



‚ÄúYes, but now it‚Äôs time to meet some of them. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre here. This is a special place where special people come to have some fun.‚Äù



‚ÄúFun‚Ä¶ as in?‚Äù



‚ÄúFight,‚Äù she answered. ‚ÄúAnd before you ask, no, it‚Äôs not gladiator-style where someone must die.‚Äù



I wanted to believe her. Meeting other people like me sounded‚Ä¶ right. But one question kept nagging. 



‚ÄúWhy was I knocked out?‚Äù



‚ÄúFor safety,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo you won‚Äôt know where we are. They do a quick medical check, too. Trust me, you don‚Äôt want to be awake for that.‚Äù



I felt nothing special. I looked down at my arm and found a small needle mark. Someone had injected me with something, probably that‚Äôs how I was knocked out. The wound pulsed, but it was the sort of dull ache I‚Äôd learned to ignore.



The door opened and a middle-aged woman in MMA gear stepped in, hands on her hips. ‚ÄúHey, Carol. Your son awake yet?‚Äù



‚ÄúHe‚Äôs up,‚Äù Mom said.



‚ÄúHe needs to rest a bit, or can he come now? We‚Äôre starting soon.‚Äù



‚ÄúHe‚Äôs ready,‚Äù Mom said.



‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù the woman replied and left.



I stood slowly. The dizziness was gone. Only the prick on my arm throbbed.



‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ why did she call you Carol?‚Äù 



Mom shrugged. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my stage name.‚Äù



‚ÄúStage name? Here?‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah. Creepy Carol.‚Äù She grinned like the name was a badge of honor.



Of course, she had a past I hadn‚Äôt been told about. She never said she was special, but I always felt a strange vibe from her.



‚ÄúAnd Creepy Carol was your best idea?‚Äù 



‚ÄúNot even close,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut when the audience gives you a nickname, it sticks.‚Äù



I had a thousand questions, but they all crowded at once and muddled into nothing.



We left the locker room and walked down a long corridor. Ahead, where I expected another plain room, the space opened up into the entrance of an arena. A tall metal fence separated the empty floor from the spectator stands.



The woman from before was already there, surrounded by a cluster of boys and girls who looked about my age. Mom stayed back by the entrance and motioned for me to join them.



‚ÄúAlright, almost everyone‚Äôs here,‚Äù the woman called, eyeing the small crowd. ‚ÄúFor those who just arrived: I‚Äôm Large Marge, and I look after the newbies. We‚Äôll start soon, but we‚Äôre waiting on one more person. Give it a few minutes.‚Äù



When she finished, the group dispersed into low chatter; for a moment, it felt like a school event and not a den of freaks. Then I actually looked at the others.



Some of them could have walked down any street and passed for normal. Others‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt. Red eyes. Sickle claws. Tattoos that crawled and reformed across someone‚Äôs arm like a living map.



I instinctively took a step back.



‚ÄúWatch it,‚Äù I heard, then bumped into two people talking. I froze because of their faces.



The boy‚Äôs features (eyes, nose, mouth, chin) were all upside down, as if his head had been attached the wrong way. The girl beside him had no face at all: smooth, tinsel-like skin stretched flat over where her features should be.



‚ÄúNo problem,‚Äù she said. Not out loud; not from any direction. Her words slid straight into my head like someone switching on a radio inside me.



‚ÄúFirst time in a place like this, huh? I had the same wide-eyed look when I first met other paranormals,‚Äù the boy said, voice normal enough.



‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I managed.



‚ÄúYou look pretty normal. What‚Äôs your knack?‚Äù the faceless girl asked.



‚ÄúMy what?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou know, your special thing. Knack, talent, blessing, curse, or whatever you want to call it.‚Äù



‚ÄúTactile telekinesis, plus limited telekinesis with small objects,‚Äù I said.



‚ÄúKinetic stuff can be pretty versatile,‚Äù the boy nodded.



‚ÄúNot mine. I‚Äôve never fought paranormal opponents. I don‚Äôt know what to expect.‚Äù



The girl didn't answer, but I could hear her giggling in my head.



The boy looked at me, his upside-down grin looked sad at first glance. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs gonna make today‚Ä¶ rough for you.‚Äù



‚ÄúEveryone!‚Äù Marge barked. ‚ÄúOur last newbie‚Äôs here, so we can begin.‚Äù



She waved us back from the arena floor to clear space. Above, the stands began to fill with friends, family, and whoever these kids had dragged along. I spotted Mom already in the crowd, and across from her, a faceless woman who had to be the faceless girl‚Äôs mother. 



Then the final ‚Äúnewbie‚Äù arrived.



At first I thought a tank had wandered in on two legs. Then I realized it was a woman. Blonde braids were the only thing that marked her as female. Everything else screamed brick wall. She was built like she‚Äôd eaten two powerlifters for breakfast. She carried something small in one of her hands.



And beside her was a man barely half her size. They looked like the Hulk walking her stick-figure husband.



Please don‚Äôt pair me with her, I prayed. Losing first would be humiliating enough. Losing to that would haunt me for the rest of my life... which would probably be a few minutes.



‚ÄúAlright, everyone. We‚Äôll begin the tournament,‚Äù Marge announced. ‚ÄúThis is just a test round, an initiation. No rankings, no stakes. I just want to know you guys. Think of it as a warm-up.‚Äù



Mom couldn‚Äôt resist. ‚ÄúMax!‚Äù she shouted from the seats. ‚ÄúIf you lose your first match, you‚Äôre sleeping in the doghouse!‚Äù



Laughter rolled through the crowd. My face burned. She‚Äôs pulled that routine at other competitions, too. Her sense of humor could kill at a dad-joke convention.



‚ÄúWait.‚Äù The Amazon‚Äôs voice thundered in a thick German accent as she pointed at Mom. ‚ÄúIs that‚Ä¶ Creepy Carol?‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs her,‚Äù Marge confirmed. Then she gestured at me. ‚ÄúHer son‚Äôs competing.‚Äù



The woman‚Äôs eyes locked onto me like I‚Äôd just been volunteered as her snack. ‚ÄúHmm. And the matchups; you chose them yet?‚Äù



‚ÄúNot yet. I'll choose them randomly,‚Äù Marge said.



‚ÄúThen I choose Creepy Carol‚Äôs boy.‚Äù



‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Marge nodded.



Mom shot back instantly, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you a little old for him, √úberfrau?‚Äù



‚ÄúObviously not for me,‚Äù the giantess smirked, and lifted the small bundle she carried in one hand. It was a baby. Swaddled tight, tiny pink face blinking out from the cloth. ‚ÄúYour son will fight mine.‚Äù



The arena hushed.



‚ÄúThe first match,‚Äù Marge declared, ‚Äúis G√ºnter versus Max!‚Äù She beckoned me forward.



My feet dragged, every step heavier than the last. √úberfrau towered above two meters, thighs thicker than my torso. The baby was a speck in her ogre-sized palm.



‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gotta be kidding me,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fighting a baby? He‚Äôs what, half a year old?‚Äù



‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Marge corrected casually. ‚ÄúHalf an hour. We waited for him to be born.‚Äù



I choked. ‚ÄúWhat?! I‚Äôm supposed to fight a newborn?‚Äù



‚ÄúHe had nine months to prepare,‚Äù √úberfrau said proudly, lowering him onto the ground. She plucked the pacifier from his mouth like she was pulling the pin on a grenade. ‚ÄúHe is already stronger than you will ever be.‚Äù



The crowd parted until it was just me and the baby in the arena. He blinked up at me with big blue eyes.



Marge raised her hand. ‚ÄúGet ready, boys.‚Äù



I stared at the infant, my brain screaming. This has to be a joke. But then I noticed something wrong. His tiny body wasn‚Äôt soft and pudgy. It was‚Ä¶ cut. Ripped. A literal six-pack on a newborn. Veins tracing his biceps.



My jaw went slack. ‚ÄúWhat the...?‚Äù



The baby‚Äôs muscles twitched, then bulged. His body ballooned in fast-forward. Kid-sized. Teen-sized. Adult-sized. In seconds, he was a towering 2.5 meters of pulsing, swollen muscle, bigger even than his mother. His legs were tree trunks, yet somehow his arms were still grotesquely oversized, and his posture hunched him forward onto his knuckles like a gorilla.



And above that mountain of nightmare flesh sat the same tiny baby head, cheeks rosy, drool stringing from his lip.



My stomach turned. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not right. That shouldn‚Äôt even exist.



‚ÄúReady‚Ä¶ fight!‚Äù Marge shouted.



G√ºnter exploded forward like a gorilla. I dove to the side, barely missing his swipe. His hand crashed into the concrete where I had stood, cracking it like drywall. He giggled again, high-pitched, like he thought we were playing tag.



I circled, kept my guard high, moved light on my feet. I waited for an opening, but there wasn‚Äôt one. Every time I got close, he swung those massive arms, swatting at the air like he was clapping for fireflies. I used little bursts of tactile telekinesis to push myself back faster than my legs alone could manage, but each time drained me.



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt wanna hit the baby?‚Äù someone in the crowd jeered. Laughter followed.



They were right. I couldn‚Äôt commit to striking his baby face. I kept dodging, shoving, slipping out of grapples. But he was adapting. Every miss, every stumble brought me closer to the fence.



He finally caught my shoulder with a swipe. Pain lanced through me as I rolled back. My head rang. I was slowing down, and he wasn‚Äôt.



My breathing grew ragged. My telekinesis flickered. I tried to shove him back, but I never used my power on somebody this big and only managed to nudge him half a step. I was cooked.



That‚Äôs when I noticed it. His mother, clutching the pacifier in her huge hand. She had yanked it free before the fight started.



And that was when I remembered: G√ºnter had started growing shortly after she pulled it out.



The thought hit me like a lightning bolt. That‚Äôs it. 



I sprinted. Not away from G√ºnter, but toward the edge of the arena where √úberfrau stood. The crowd howled in confusion. G√ºnter roared and thundered after me.



His mother stepped back, clutching the pacifier closer.



I was too slow. I felt the air vanish behind me a split second before G√ºnter‚Äôs massive hand closed around my ankle. Pain shot through my leg as he yanked me back like I had no weight. I was upside down, dangling like a toy in a toddler‚Äôs fist.



‚ÄúNo, no, no!‚Äù I shouted, clawing at the ground.



I reached, not with my hands, but with every ounce of focus left in me. The pacifier was small enough, light enough. My telekinesis brushed against it. It slipped from the Amazon's hand.



As G√ºnter hurled me across the arena like a rag doll, I dragged the pacifier toward me with a desperate psychic tug. I barely managed to flick it forward in midair, aiming it right at his mouth.



The thing popped between his lips just as I slammed onto the concrete, my body screaming from the impact. 



I looked up, dazed. G√ºnter loomed above me, both fists raised like he was about to smash me into paste.



Then‚Ä¶ silence.



His eyes softened. The fists dropped. He began to suckle. His whole body shuddered, then started to deflate. Muscles collapsed inward. Veins shrank. The hulking toddler shriveled back down into a drooling infant.



The crowd gasped, then erupted in cheers.



Marge‚Äôs voice cut through it all. ‚ÄúWinner: Max.‚Äù



I lay there, chest heaving, every bone vibrating with pain, staring at the pacifier bobbing in and out of the baby‚Äôs lips.



I had survived. Barely.

This is a thread to pool all our observations to try to figure out better, community-observed environments and conditions where Claude does better than not.***

I've been using Claude Code enough that I've started segmenting ""poor performance"" and ""good performance"" in my head based on what I can observe to try to figure out what I can control and what I can't. 

Having a ""current context window capacity"" indicator has helped a lot with this. (that's what the squirrel thing is, I'm at 82% or 155k context window usage in the screenshot.)

https://preview.redd.it/owar2picazof1.png?width=649&format=png&auto=webp&s=382182246f0aad2de890ffb060f8434423b1a668

So this post is meant to organize my observations in hopes that others have been doing similar so that maybe we can do the proper engineering thing and understand more concisely what leads to Good Claude (Git-it-gud) and Bad Claude (derpy derp). Because, even if things are moving extremely fast, we are still trying to figure out how to use LLMs efficiently. This tech is still bleeding edge when it comes to code generation / self-correcting LLM processes.

This is just some of what I've observed under different situations and what I assume is root cause, which then leads me to follow-up questions:

\-----

**Claude can respond snappy and Claude can take 5-10 secs before that token climbing indicator shows up (which I'm glad they put back)**

* Part of this is probably server load (the observed EU peeps have a speedway of snappy Claude responses until Americans get on)
* Part of this is complexity of request (It seems like you'll get a faster response on your query if its spelled correctly vs throwing in mispellings). Throw ""think"" vs ""think hard"" on there is also a response lag scalar. I've attributed this to whatever internal pre-processing hook Anthropic runs to figure out where to direct the request and how much processing power to give it

**Question that follows:** My understanding from reading Anthropic's docs is that Claude has a 5-min cache. Does longer response times lead to weird cache cutoffs that 1hr caches will fix with something like [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/amazon-bedrock)?

Observations:

* In doing long sessions, repeatedly changing the same file, Claude seems to start acting differently as it edits files. Initially, itll know what to change and how to change it, but after a few iterations, or if I go get coffee and come back, I've vaguely observed it act more confused about what its editing, and this leads me to wonder if root cause is this short sliding cache window.  
* When I start seeing it reach this confused state, I'll have it re-read a doc. If it re-reads partial sections, it'll stay confused, until I tell it go re-read the whole doc. Then its a total light-bulb moment.

I haven't correlated this directly to cache cutoffs, because there's also the possibility that multiple back and forth exchanges lead to some sort of previous message ""compacting"" to optimize for token usage. Example being, Anthropic recently added ""Tool output clearing"", which decreases the context window load the further you get away from older tool responses.

\-----

**Claude seems to have some sort of awareness of context window max or ability to judge length of task against ""max turns"" or Anthropic's internal ""sessions should only last this long""**

Observations:

* I have Claude write out test case stubs before filling them in. If it struggles to fill in some and make them pass or struggles with the lint<=>typescript death fix circle, it will make unprompted comments of ""this is gonna take too long, let me do this instead"" and its usually a shortcut or escape hatch
* For files that Claude fills in in pieces without hitting lint or test failure walls, it doesn't make these offhanded ""I have a timelimit"" comments, even if the file has 100 test cases.
* In both these situations, I've observed Context Window token count, and depending how the task is broken up, claude will hit ""Im taking too much time, let me pivot"" around 65%-75% as well as 90%. And then will really resist running wild after 90%. It'll do something and then tell you its done, or tell you it did part of the task, as if trying to really avoid that 100% mark.

**Questions that follows:** Is Claude doing some sort of internal analysis of ""how much effort/run time is this gonna take"". If I tell it to fill in 100 test cases in chunks, I get a very whiny, ""lazy"" claude going through them, but if I tell it to do this chunk then this chunk, and not hint that we're filling them all in, I seem to get much better ""non-whiny"" claude results. It might still struggle with test cases, but if it ""perceives"" the task as small vs medium vs large (if I rate them in my head as thus), the model seems to act differently.

\-----

**Claude seems to have an ""internal"" memory that leads to unexpected output degradation**

Observations:

* You ask claude summarize or write docs, and they are always around 500 lines. Part of this is training, but part of this I think is something else
* If I have Claude code review a code file against certain standards, no matter if the context window is at 30k or 100k, it will stop finding issues after a certain amount, to where if you have it write to a file, you'll usually get 10-12 items max.
* But if I tell claude, go submit issues you find to an MCP in pieces, I'll get much more consistent results that go past the 12 item mark, if it finds that many items.

I was talking to an expert professional LLM scientist and he was saying something about there being a 7k token chunk max per result output that LLMs have to stitch together if the response is longer than 7k.

**Questions that follow:** Are those weird instances of ""this syntax is really outta place"" or ""why'd you ignore all my standards when you made this"", because of this ""output is longer than x # tokens, llm had to generate two chunks, and then when it stitched together, it had to fill in the gaps with just its training data"" moments.

\----

**Claude picks and chooses from large outputs and struggles with repeated similar tool calling**

This is probably already known, just with the way LLMs work, but: 

Observations:

* If Claude's stuck in a loop of ""fix these lint errors"" which causes other lint errors, it starts retrying things after about the 3rd - 4th loop. So its task loop seems to have a different way to process stuff than its conversation loop and doesn't accumulate things its tried as memory of what to not try again if the output is long enough. As in, every time Claude takes a turn, its rerunning the whole session output through an LLM to find the next output. But specifically in troubleshooting loops, it doesn't always process what its tried already and will attempt it again.
* If Claude console logs ""Success"" in a tool, but doesn't add any if boundaries around what success is, it will think the script is successful. Sometimes. This might go back to perf or cache issues, but sometimes it can keep track of ""I made this change, I should expect this result"" and even if it sees success, will look for other things in the output to actually prove that to itself. Other times, itll see success and think its passed. Lower context window load will see this confusion less, than if you're past 70% context window load. 
* If the output has success and failures in it, and this is attempt 3 of fixing an issue, it'll start making concessions of ""well this is still erroring but its not because of me for this reason"" or again ""this still isnt working, let me just move on""
* If you have Claude output a huge file that has a lot of lint errors, and have the ide mcp with the file open, or even if you tell claude to then go run lint, you can clog Claude's context window really quickly without intending to, and if this clog happens very quickly over and over, you hit context window max much quicker (obviously), but also Claude's hallucination escalates much quick than if it makes 100 lint errors over 30 code changes.

**Questions that follows:** Do we need to gatekeep what output AI gets and not let it use raw eslint or tsc output to keep it from confusing itself. <= This one I'm at the point of saying is necessary, which is annoying.

\-----

This is already pretty long, but curious if others are doing the same observations. I've definitely had to rework some of my tooling ecosystem and code setups because of these observations, so I think they're helpful to make if you're trying to get the most outta Claude.",0,1757793441.0,ClaudeCode,0,0.5,False

1ng70ub,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskKratomVendors/comments/1ng70ub/visiting_the_kratom_farms_of_indonesia/,Visiting the Kratom Farms of Indonesia,"I visited Indonesia a few years back. I was in a very lucky position where I was working online and was able to spend years traveling the world. I already had a YouTube channel based on kratom when I came to SE Asia. The channel was fairly basic with me doing kratom reviews of different companies from all over the world. I decided to visit Indonesia in order to take the channel to the next level.

While in Indonesia I spent slightly over three months living with different kratom suppliers. I have said this many times before but the Indos are the most friendly people I have ever met. There is some business interest mixed in here in that they want me to make a YouTube video about their company. A good YouTube video has the potential to represent many thousands in sales for these companies and so this is one reason I might have received so much love. However, outside of business I have found that most people after only a 10 minute conversation will be willing to invite you over to dinner with the family. It's really quite refreshing to witness such kindness expressed culturally.

For the climax of this 3 month trip in Indonesia, I rode out to Kapuas Hulu with a kratom friend I had made. Readers should know that Kapuas Hulu is possibly the furthest away from western civilization you can get and I did not see another westerner for 45 days. A record for me for sure. The drive to Kapuas Hulu took about 18 hours of drive time that we did in two separate days. The road to Kapuas Hulu started out as a 2 lane highway and gradually became more of a dirt trail. There were many obstacles on the way that you would not expect to see in a western country. A truck had come off its back axle which stopped traffic for many hours until the proper equipment could get there to remove the truck. We slept in a sort of open door coffee shop. I was unsure if my guide knew the owner or if it was standard procedure to let people sleep on the benches of the shop because there were many people besides my group that were doing the same. I slept on a bench in my clothes without a blanket or pillow. Something a less weathered traveler than myself might not have been comfortable doing.

Kapuas Hulu the city is intensely beautiful. The population in this area lives off the river which will flood seasonally. Because of this all the houses are built on stilts that allow the water to flow freely underneath. To get from place to place you walk on a boardwalk above the water and mud. Very few people own cars but rather they own a boat that might be shared between families. Most of the area is not connected with roads and so boats are entirely necessary for most of the population who live here.

The people will usually hang out near the banks of the river, fishing off of docks, flying kites, and taking boats out on the river. While we mostly did not speak the same language, I became something of a celebrity for a short bit as I was clearly not from that part of the world. It was a super fun and wholesome time with both children and elderly all enjoying the same moment.

The kratom farms that we were planning to visit were up river about half an hour by boat. We woke up early in the morning and headed by boat deep into the jungle to visit with the kratom pickers who spend their days filling long canoe type boats with kratom leaves that they pick from wild kratom growing in the jungle. I was told that the land was owned by the company and so they had the ability to keep other kratom pickers off the land but most kratom was harvested from public land along the river banks. I did see kratom farms with planted kratom in Indonesia but my intuition is that the vast majority of kratom is picked from trees that were not planted.

After we visited with the kratom pickers we headed to the drying houses where the kratom was placed in a big room on racks where it was allowed to dry. After dried it would be given to ""winnowing ladies"" who were tasked with removing the stems from the leaf. To do this they place crushed leaves into a basket they hold in their laps. They then toss the leaf allowing the heavy material to sort itself out. This is done in the drying house which is a very hot room and is a job that requires you to get covered in dust. Months later I asked how much these women make and I was informed that it comes out to be slightly less than $6 per day.

Before heading back to the city we loaded our truck with huge bags of destemmed kratom leaf. The drive back was spectacular. Particularly near the Kapuas Hulu area I was reminded of the movie Avatar with the lush jungles and mountains covered in fog. The soil of Kalimantan has long been known to be extremely rich and when discovered by western explorers many spices were brought back and sold in the market. There are many palm oil farms that have started to show up all over the island which you can directly see having a negative effect on the ecosystem, which is kinda sad just because the land is so beautiful. Everyone needs to make a living though.

Once back in the Pontianak grinding facility the kratom leaf is put through the final step of being ground into a fine powder. From there the kratom is shipped out all over the world (almost entirely the USA).

Conclusion

What struck me most was the humility and hospitality of everyone I met. There are real challenges in the system. Things like pricing pressures, and the ongoing balance between tradition and modern economic demand. In Southeast Asia, kratom isn‚Äôt just a product; it‚Äôs part of the landscape and deeply woven into the culture.

What‚Äôs worth remembering is that buying kratom connects the global economy in a way that channels resources to people who are often able make the most of them. It‚Äôs actually wild to me that kratom carries the reputation it does, while some of the intensely positive impacts are left behind the scenes are so often overlooked.

His characters don't avoid pain - they build beautiful, elaborate ways to approach it safely. When those facades crack (Richie's breakdown, Max dropping his guard), they hit harder because they emerge from such careful construction.

1ng6lm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1ng6lm8/reveal_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_keurig/,Reveal the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K-Express Worth It,"Testing out coffee makers is something I‚Äôve grown to enjoy over the years, and the Keurig K-Cup was recently added to my arsenal. Having used it daily for a few weeks, this compact machine surprised me with its combination of simplicity and functionality. I‚Äôll walk you through my experience with it, so grab a cup of coffee and let‚Äôs get into it.

**Sleek and Practical Design**  
The design immediately caught my eye upon unpacking it. Standing at just 12.2 inches tall and six and a half inches wide, it fit snugly in the limited counter space of my kitchen. A matte black finish gave it a polished, modern look that is neutral enough to blend in but still commands attention when noticed. The removable 36-ounce reservoir on the side made me sigh in relief since I didn‚Äôt have to refill it before every use. It‚Äôs lightweight too, at around 4.5 pounds, making it easily portable if, for some reason, moving it is necessary.  

**Ease of Use: A Machine for Everyone**  
Making a cup of coffee with this machine couldn‚Äôt be easier. Insert a K-Cup pod, hit one of the clearly labeled buttons, and voil√†‚Äîyou‚Äôve got coffee. It also accommodates three cup sizes: 6, 8, and 10 ounces, which has been useful for customizing how much caffeine my mornings (or afternoons) require. Plus, the fact that it powers off automatically five minutes after brewing adds a layer of convenience‚Äîyou don‚Äôt need to worry about it sucking up energy unnecessarily.  

**Want [Keurig K-Cup] discounts? Check Amazon.**  

**Performance and Back-to-Back Brewing**  
One feature I was genuinely impressed with was its back-to-back brewing capability. My household loves coffee, so the ability to brew multiple cups without waiting for the machine to reheat has saved us a lot of morning chaos. And for a single-serve coffee maker, it brews fairly quickly. The coffee itself always comes out hot and fresh, rivaling brews I‚Äôve had from bigger, more industrial machines.  

**Highlights**  
- Compact and space-saving, ideal for small kitchens or dorm rooms.  
- Multiple cup size options cater to individual preferences.
- Back-to-back brewing eliminates wait times between cups.  
- The removable reservoir makes for mess-free refills and cleaning.  

**Negatives**  
- Some users might find the 36-ounce reservoir capacity limited.  
- Doesn‚Äôt come with a water filter, which could improve flavor for areas with hard water.  
- The machine is designed primarily for K-Cup pods, so while you can use a reusable filter for ground coffee, it‚Äôs an additional piece you‚Äôll need to purchase.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this machine to others in its league, like the Nespresso Essenza Mini or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, gives some perspective. While Nespresso might cater to those who prefer a more refined, espresso-like flavor, its pods are pricier and harder to source locally. On the other hand, the FlexBrew offers dual brewing (carafe and single-serve) options but sacrifices portability and compactness. What sets the Keurig K-Cup apart is its blend of accessibility and user-friendly features, hitting a sweet spot that other brands often miss.  

**Money‚Äôs Worth**  
Examining value, this machine holds its ground against similar options on the market. Its affordable price point, combined with its efficient brewing and space-saving design, makes it a smart buy for daily coffee drinkers or even occasional users. You‚Äôre getting reliable performance with minimal fuss, and it doesn‚Äôt feel like corners were cut on quality. Even for coffee-making beginners, this machine provides a great introduction.

\-By this time, a girl named Abby Samuels either lives somewhere in Washington or currently attends Oregon State University. On this day, while FaceTiming her boyfriend, Abby drops her phone down the stairs. It breaks, so she looks on Yelp for a place to fix it and calls the Broke 2 Fixed kiosk in the Kirkland Mall. They say they will have it done in under an hour, so Abby takes it to the kiosk where Grayson Wentz works. He tells her he will need to keep her phone overnight, and that he also needs the password to her phone. She gives it to him, and it is here that Grayson steals multiple private photos and videos of Abby's and create Brooke Wheeler, a fake online persona he later uses to catfish and then blackmail students and faculty of St. Bernadine.

\-Soon after, Grayson messages as many students and faculty of St. Bernadine as he can posing as Brooke Wheeler, attempting to catfish them into a false online relationship. Only a small number of people responded to ""her"" messages, and an even smaller number of people engaged in prolonged conversation with ""her.""

\-One of the Turd Burglar posts of the Brownout includes the caption: ""Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels, ""Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowels of the wrath of God.""

\-Paul Schnorrenberg posts on Instagram: ""For behind, the LORD will come in fire And his chariots like the whirlwind, To render His anger with fury, And his rebuke with flames of fire. For the LORD will execute judgment by fire And by His sword on all flesh, And those slain by the LORD will be many. #isaiah66:15-16""

\-Paul also posts on Instagram: ""The Lord will fight for you; you only need to be still üòá. #Exodus1414""

At 8:20 PM, Paul Schnorrenberg Tweets: ""Praying for forgiveness and merciful punishment for your soulsüôè.""

\-Later that night, Kevin goes to a motel with a backpack filled with the bag of condoms he bought from Dawsey's. He was supposed to meet up with Brooke Wheeler after the Brownout. After about 20 minutes, Kevin texts Brooke the room number and waits some more. After sending more texts to her, asking where she is, Brooke sends one final text to Kevin. It reads: ""You act like you're smarter than everyone else. But everything about you is fake. The way you dress, the way you talk, you're full of shit. Just like me.""

\-Brooke then blocks Kevin.

# [November 7th 2017]

\-The Turd Burglar's Instagram account gains over 800 followers in just one day.

\-Several victims of the Brownout don't show up to school the next day, presumably due to still being sick or their parents pulling them out of school.

\-The lemonade from the Brownout is submitted to the Bellevue Police Department for analysis.

\-Paul Schnorrenberg posts on Instagram: ""Our thoughts and prayers are with those affected by the Brownout üôè.""

\-@theturdburglar posts a picture of a poop emoji in a brown fedora and trench coat on Instagram with the caption: ""Still can't find me? I strike in 3 days. Try to crack it.""

# [November 9th 2017]

\-During a basketball game at another school, Chloe Lyman is standing in line at the vending machine behind DeMarcus Tillman, who was buying Gatorade. When he pulls out some cash to pay, Chloe sees the Turd Burglar card in his wallet.

\-Trevor ""Gonzo"" Gonzales sees the card too. He tells the basketball team, but they don't believe him.

\-Paul Schnorrenberg posts on Instagram: ""Matthew 6:33 got me like üòé.""

\-Drew Pankratz Tweets: ""A‚ç∞ can't wait to go to college. #OverIt""

\-At 7:54 PM, a series of messages between Jenna Hawthorne and Brooke Wheeler (Grayson) takes place. The messages are:

**Brooke:** ""**\[sends her a set of coordinates\]**""

**Brooke:** ""A package will be waiting for you.""

**Jenna:** ""What is this?""

**Jenna:** ""Brooke. Please. This is crazy.""

**Jenna:** ""Brooke: I'm not doing this.""

**Brooke:** ""The provided instructions will tell you everything you need to know,""

**Jenna:** ""Can I call you?""

**Jenna:** ""Brooke.  I can't do this. Please.""

**Brooke:** ""If you don't I'm going to show everyone all of your pictures and all of our conversations so everyone can see that behind your pretty little rich girl instagram is a self-absorbed liar who's completely full of shit.""

**Jenna:** ""Brooke, please....""

\-Brooke then starts telling Jenna that she better keep her happy ""or else.""

\-Soon afterwards, Jenna arrives at the coordinates sent to her. Upon arrival, she sees a box in the middle of the alleyway with her name on it. Inside the box are Turd Burglar t-shirts, Ziploc bags filled with cat shit, and printed out instructions on how to roll the shit into the t-shirts and load them into the cannon.

# [November 10th 2017]

\-Around this time, Brooke (Grayson) texts DeMarcus Tillman telling him to meet her (him) in an alley. As with Jenna, DeMarcus arrives to the location and sees a box. Inside are big bags of shit, a Turd Burglar card, some directions on how to load the poop into the Kurt Vonnegut pi√±ata, and printed out pictures of every embarrassing thing DeMarcus had ever sent her (him). Brooke tells him that if he doesn't do it, she'll spread around his dick pics.

\-Police report of the lemonade is finished. Liquid analysis concludes that it was contaminated with the laxative maltitol.

\-Ms. Montgomery, the English teacher at St. Bernadine, hosts her annual Kurt Vonnegut day for the third year in a row. Presumably, this day is normally held on November 11th, Vonnegut's birthday. But since November 11th 2017 is on a Saturday, Ms. Montgomery had to celebrate a day early. She decorates her classroom, and has a cake and pi√±ata every period that she pays for with her own money.

\-During lunch, DeMarcus loads the poop into a Vonnegut pi√±ata.

\-Later that day, in Ms. Montgomery's class, Paul Schnorrenberg hits the pi√±ata, and poop flies out of the pi√±ata in different directions, covering the students and Ms. Montgomery in feces. This incident is named ""The Poop Pi√±ata"".

\-@theturdburglar posts a picture of the Vonnegut pinata with the Turd Burglar card. The caption reads: ""Within the confines of this school, you will find a lot of shitheads. üí©üç©üí©""

# [November 11th 2017]

\-@theturdburglar makes another Instagram post, this time a picture of a statue about to get pooped on by another statue. The caption reads: ""On November 14th, shit is about to hit the fan.""

\-@theturdburglar makes another post of a statue covered in bird poop. The caption reads: ""Poop haiku for you, Stinky is the common theme, Cheer for my blessing #3moredays""

# [November 12th 2017]

\-A series of texts in a group chat between DeMarcus, Lou, and Perry Coleman, at 9:55 PM occurs. The texts are:

**DeMarcus:** ""U playing Washington on Mon, right?""

**Perry:** ""Yup""

**DeMarcus:** ""FT?""

# [November 13th 2017]

\-One week after the Brownout, Bellevue Police Department still has zero leads as to the identity of the Turd Burglar. They then start interviewing every student in the school.

# [November 14th 2017]

\-St. Bernadine has a pep rally in preparation of their basketball game against a rival team who is undefeated.

\-Security for the pep rally checks everyone's backpacks before letting them in.

\-The shirts inside the t-shirt cannons are replaced with Turd Burglar shirts. The shirts are also rolled up with cat poop inside.

\-Sometime before the pep rally, DeMarcus hurts his ankle. Lou takes him to physical therapy, but they don't tell anybody but Tyler Ramsden, the captain of the basketball team, fearing that if a rumor gets out that DeMarcus is injured it will make them look bad.

\-Jenna Hawthorne sneaks into Coach Devlin's office to replace the t-shirts in the cannon with the Turd Burglar shirts. Following the instructions, she rolls the shit into the t-shirts and loads them into the cannon.

\-Brooke (Grayson) then tells Jenna to take a picture of the loaded cannons and send a picture to her (him). Jenna sends her the picture, and Brooke (Grayson) ghosts her.

\-While coming back from DeMarcus' physical therapy, Lou sees Jenna Hawthorne running out of the gym and getting into her car. While they are trying to park, Jenna crashes her car into Lou's. She sends him $750 to cover for the damages.

\-Before and during the pep rally, Ms. Montgomery and Paul Schnorrenberg are having another ""spirited debate"" as they often do due to Paul's extreme religiousness. Paul apparently thinks the Pope is too radical, while Ms. Montgomery thinks he's ""kinda cool.""

\-Lou and DeMarcus are seen running into the gym at the last second, even though they are supposed to be 30 minutes early to the pep rally for the walkthrough.

\-The t-shirts are launched into the crowd, covering the air and the crowd with a cloud of poop dust. The incident is named ""The Shit Launcher.""

\-Jared Wilkinson later states that he was one of three people who caught a Turd Burglar shirt.

\-@theturdburglar posts a photo of the t-shirt launcher next to a Turd Burglar card. The caption reads: ""I just love it when a pep rally becomes a üí© rally.""

\-After the Shit Launcher, and seeing how Lou and DeMarcus ran into the pep rally at the last second, the basketball team finally takes Gonzo seriously and they start pointing fingers at Lou and DeMarcus. Soon after, Tyler Ramsden sends an email to the team. It reads:

""*JUST TO REFRESH EVERYONE'S MEMORY, DEMARCUS AND LOU WERE AT THE WALK THROUGH. DO YOU HAVE DEMENTIA? I'M NOT JOKING. IF YOU REMEMBER OTHERWISE REPORT TO ME AFTER PRACTICE WITH WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE DEMENTIA. MAYBE I CAN REFRESH YOUR MEMORY. THEY. WERE. WITH. US. WE DON'T NEED THE BEST PLAYER IN THE COUNTRY GETTING BAD PRESS BECAUSE OF YOUR SHITTY MEMORIES.*

*-T*""

# [November 17th 2017]

\-St. Bernadine skip day, an annual event where students pitch in for an Airbnb and skip class to party.

\-Group texts between DeMarcus, Lou, and Perry occur. The texts read:

Perry, 1:22 PM: ""Leaving now. be there in 30"" **\[he shares his Lyft route\]**

DeMarcus, 1:23 PM: ""See u soon.""

\-At 1:23, a video of the skip day party is seen showing Lou Carter on the phone with someone (presumably the police). Chloe Lyman and Tanner Bassett are also seen making out.

\-Lou texts Perry and DeMarcus at 1:33 PM saying: ""Hey don't bother. The cops are here.""

\-At 1:39 PM, the cops arrive and the party is busted.

\-Tanner, angry and convinced that Kevin is the one who called the cops on the party, drives to his house and the two get into a heavy argument where Tanner accuses Kevin of being jealous.

# [November 19th 2017]

\-Kevin kicks Tanner out of their band, The Horsehead Collective, and later replaces him with a middle schooler named Myles that he met at a bar mitzvah.

# [November 20th 2017]

\-Tanner goes to the police for an interview where he accuses Kevin of being the Turd Burglar.

# [November 21st 2017]

\-Kevin is interviewed by the police.

\-After hours of interrogation, Mrs. Wexler asks the police if Kevin can take a break. During that break, she promises him that the school would not press charges against him and that they would just treat the incident as a prank.

\-After meeting with Mrs. Wexler, Kevin confesses to being the Turd Burglar.

\-Kevin is then expelled from St. Bernadine.

# [November 22nd 2017]

\-The day after Kevin is expelled, Chloe goes to the school telling them about the Turd Burglar card in DeMarcus' wallet and that Kevin is innocent. Nobody believes her.

# [November 30th 2017]

\-Kevin is placed on house arrest.

\-@theturdburglar posts a picture of South Park's Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo with the caption: ""On the Fourth of December my true love gave to me üå≥üå≥üí©üå≥""

# [December 1st 2017]

\-Chloe emails Peter asking him for help in solving the Turd Burglar case. She writes:

""Hi Peter,

My name is Chloe Lyman and I am a junior at St Bernadine Catholic School in Bellevue, Washington. First off, let me just say that I loved American Vandal. It was a great documentary and I was especially impressed by the hard work you and Sam put into getting to the root of the crime. You seemed to genuinely care about Dylan's situation and wanted to make sure an innocent student didn't go down for a crime he didn't commit. That's exactly what drove people like me to watch it and love it. Peter, it looks like St. Bernadine is going to need some of that compassion. We have a vandal of our who calls himself ""The Turd Burglar."" He's all anyone at our schools been able to talk about since November 6th, when he poisoned the cafeteria lemonade and caused dozens of students to lose control of their bowels. The St. Bernadine administration and the Bellevue police launched an deep investigation and interviewed practically everyone in the school to gather what information they could. In the end, they came to the decision that a student named Kevin McClain is the Turd Burglar, and I know that's just not true. Full disclosure, Kevin is a friend of mine. But that's not why I'm contacting you about this. I have information about the Turd Burglar's identity that the school doesn't know, or maybe they just don't want to know. In any case, we need your help. I'm contacting you today to ask if you and Sam would be willing to come to St. Bernadine and investigate the Turd Burglar. I'm sure you've been flooded with emails since the success of your first documentary, but I think this would be well-worth your time. After seeing what you two were able to do with Dylan's case, I believe you can prove both Kevin's innocence and the Turd Burglar's real identity.

Thank you for your time,

Chloe Lyman""

\-Peter decides to make the Turd Burglar case his next investigation.

# [December 4th 2017]

\-Around this time, Peter and Sam give a presentation to their teachers at Hanover High. They are approved to make the Turd Burglar investigation their senior project.

\-In the St. Bernadine teacher's lounge, someone puts cat poop coated in chocolate in the lounge's advent calendar. Mr. Fernandez, the calculus teacher, eats the poop mistaking it for candy, and immediately vomits in a plant. Another person vomits in the sink.

\-Mr. Fernandez leaves school after second period. Hot Janitor, a male custodian at St. Bernadine known for being very attractive, is called in to clean up the mess. Mrs. Wexler also has him bleach the whole advent calendar.

\-@theturdburglar posts a picture of the advent calendar on Instagram with the caption: ""Merry Christmas to all, to all a good night...""

\-Mrs. Wexler orders any teacher who was present in the teacher's lounge during the Crap Calendar to stay silent, since admitting the Turd Burglar is still at large after Kevin's confession would bring more negative attention to the school. Mrs. Wexler also names Mr. Fernandez the head chaperone of this year's Gifts of the Lamb retreat, an annual event where a select group of students and staff go on a trip to Costa Rica to do charity work for poor people and afterwards stay in a luxury hotel.

# [December 5th 2017]

\-Hanover High School newspaper reports about American Vandal filming season 2.

\-Peter and Sam travel to Bellevue, Washington with a small crew (including Ming Zhang) to investigate the Turd Burglar. Chloe lets them stay at her house. Season 2 of American Vandal officially begins filming.

**(NOTE: Ming Zhang is featured in the season 2 opening credits as one of the additional photographers. This strongly implies that Ming was there with Peter and Sam filming them during the Turd Burglar investigation, he just was never shown on camera)**

\-Hot Janitor is transferred by Mrs. Wexler to St. Bernadine's sister school St. Mary's, located an hour away.

# [December 6th 2017]

\-St. Bernadine hires a new C Hall custodian to replace Hot Janitor.

# [December 10th 2017]

\-Around this time, it is discovered that during his interrogation, Mrs. Wexler promised Kevin that the school would not press charges against him for the crimes he allegedly committed. Mrs. Wexler declines multiple interview requests from Peter.

\-On this day, Peter receives an email from Mrs. Wexler. She writes:

*""Dear Mr. Maldonado,*

*I appreciate you reaching out, but the issues in question have already been resolved because of Mr. McClain's own words. and confession. I could never promise a student a reduced punishment for crimes of this nature. This took place a few weeks ago, but to the best of my knowledge, we spoke only of how he was feeling, and how he wanted the guilt off his shoulders.*

*I regret I will be unable to be of further assistance.*

*Enjoy your time at St. Bernadine.*

*Sincerely,*

*Mrs. Wexler*

*Dean of Students""*

# [December 13th 2017]

\-Peter interviews DeMarcus. He talks about Perry Coleman and how he set the precedent that athletes pull off pranks and get away with it. DeMarcus becomes belligerent and leaves, but he still agrees to sit down for future interviews.

# [December 14th 2017]

\-The Turd Burglar account messages Peter on Instagram. He writes: ""Peter. If you're trying to find me... you're doing a shitty job.

\-Peter messages the Turd Burglar back saying: ""Shitty job or not, if you're reaching out to us then you must have something you want to say, so say it.""

\-The Turd Burglar messages Peter back telling him to meet him at a set of coordinates. The coordinates lead to an alley with nothing but a piece of poop on the ground with a little Turd Burglar card stuck in the poop. The Turd Burglar then messages him again saying ""Time to get your hands dirty Peter.""

\-Peter digs through the poop with chop sticks but finds nothing. Peter expresses that he didn't understand the point of this, with Sam believing that the Turd Burglar just wanted him to have to dig through poop with chop sticks.

# [January 16th 2018]

\-Kevin McClain Tweets: ""I don't celebrate New years. people like me are cognizant of the passing of time on a daily, if not continuous basis. hence, I have no need for such a holiday.

# [January 17th 2018]

\-Kevin Tweets: ""If humanity spent a little less brain power contemplating sports we'd have flying cars by now.""

# [January 18th 2018]

\-Kevin Tweets: ""I can fit more words in a sentence than Ms. Montgomery can fit in a 45 minute class.""

# [January 19th 2018]

\-Kevin posts a picture of the 24 Stop employee on Twitter with the caption: ""I've been reading so much Greek philosophy that it finds it's way into every conversation I have. I think I've quoted Aristotle twice today and it's only 10AM.""

# [January 20th 2018]

\-Kevin Tweets: ""Today's biggest problem facing teenagers isn't texting and driving; it's bad grammar. If your 16 and still don't know the difference between ""Their"" ""There"" and ""They're"" you shouldn't be allowed a cellphone.""

# [January 21st 2018]

\-Kevin Tweets: ""ICYMI using ridiculous slang acronyms are childish and make you look neanderthalic.""

\-Presumably on this day, Peter and Sam interview Perry Coleman via video chat. Perry claimed Lou sabotaged his friendship with DeMarcus because both Lou and DeMarcus' father want DeMarcus to go to college in Oregon, and fear that Perry might brainwash him into going to UCLA if they keep hanging out. Perry also claims that Lou ""runs the DeMarcus show"", but also says that there's no way DeMarcus could be the Turd Burglar because Lou is too invested in his business with him that he would never jeopardize it by letting DeMarcus commit crimes like that. Perry also reveals that Lou is the one who called the police on the Skip Day party.

\-It is here that Peter and Sam obtain the group text from the day of the party sent to DeMarcus and Perry by Lou where he claims that the cops had busted the party 6 minutes before they actually showed up.

# [January 22nd 2018]

\-Peter and Sam approach DeMarcus and Lou. Here, they show them the photo of Lou on his phone 16 minutes before the police arrive. Lou refuses to show them his call log for the day.

\-Afterwards, Lou confronts Gonzo, convinced that he is the one who has been talking to Peter and Sam. Lou insists that there was no Turd Burglar card in DeMarcus' wallet, and that they were both at the walkthrough during the pep rally. Lou tells Gonzo that if he gets those two facts right, they won't have any problems. Gonzo tells Lou to go fuck himself, and Lou punches Gonzo in the face, giving him a black eye.

\-Six hours after presenting Lou and DeMarcus with the Skip Day footage, Gonzo contacts Peter claiming to have new information. In this interview, he claims that he in fact did see the Turd Burglar card in DeMarcus' wallet and how Lou attacked him. He also presents them the email sent to the basketball team the day of the pep rally by Tyler Ramsden.

\-Kevin posts a video of himself at the 24 Stop, a convenience store by his house, complaining about the $3 service charge on the ATM. He adds the caption ""#larceny"".

\-Peter messages the Turd Burglar saying ""Are you happy the entire basketball team agreed to let Kevin take the fall?""

\-The Turd Burglar replies: ""You're onto something Peter. Maybe they did let Kevin take the fall. Or maybe Kevin was in on it the whole time. You wanna know the truth? Here it is:""

\-The Turd Burglar then sends them a GIF of a giant panda pooping on another panda's face.

\-At the same time the texts from the Turd Burglar were sent to Peter, Kevin is seen on the outside security camera of the 24 Stop standing there eating ice cream. Suddenly, DeMarcus and Lou pull up and confront Kevin, slapping his ice cream out of his hand. DeMarcus tells Kevin to stop talking to Peter and Sam out of fear that the Turd Burglar will release their private photos and conversations.

\-Immediately after being confronted, Kevin walks into the 24 Stop, pulls ice cream out of the freezer, and starts eating it without paying for it. The employee walks over and tells him he can't do that. He doesn't respond, so the employee kicks him out and bans him from the store.

# [January 23rd 2018]

\-Kevin texts Peter saying ""I haven't exactly been honest with you, Peter... I'm no longer able to participate in your documentary. I'm sorry, but your ending is the same as your beginning. I did it. It's me. I am the Turd Burglar.""

\-Presumably on the same day, Kevin blocks Peter and Sam on social media as well as their phone numbers.

# [January 24th 2018 (assumed)]

\-Peter and Sam go to Kevin's house to present him with the basketball team email but Myles answers the door and says Kevin is not there. They ask Myles to give Kevin a folder with the email inside but Myles tosses it on the ground and closes the door. Peter and Sam then leave the folder in Kevin's mailbox.

\-Peter and Sam hang outside of the 24 Stop hoping Kevin will show up eventually. Suddenly the employee comes out and tells them they have to buy something or wait somewhere else, and that Kevin wouldn't be coming back because he was banned from the store. They then convince the employee to show them the security footage of Kevin from the other day.

\-Peter confronts Lou about the video. Lou claims they confronted Kevin for starting rumors about DeMarcus being the Turd Burglar. Lou also claims that the email sent to the basketball team was about DeMarcus' physical therapy for his ankle, and not about the Turd Burglar. Lou also reveals that the reason they were late to the pep rally was because they got into an accident with Jenna Hawthorne while they were parking. Lou shows Peter the insurance photos and the invoice from Jenna for $750.

\-While processing the new evidence, Peter notices that the footage from the 24 Stop takes place at the exact same time the Turd Burglar had texted him the other day. Since none of them were on their phones in the video, this proves that neither DeMarcus, Lou, nor Kevin could be the Turd Burglar.

**(NOTE: I am assuming this is all set on the same day two days after Kevin was confronted because A: they are all wearing the same clothes in these scenes, and B: in the scene after they talked to Lou about the footage, Chloe asks Peter when the Turd Burglar last texted him, and he says ""the other day"", meaning at least two or three days ago.)**

# [January 25th 2018 (assumed)]

\-Presumably the next day, Peter goes to DeMarcus and Lou and lets them know about the texts and that they can't be the Turd Burglar. He also asks Lou to elaborate about the accident with Jenna Hawthorne. It is here that they learn Jenna lied about her alibi for all three crimes, making her the prime Turd Burglar suspect.

\-Later, Sam discovers that in one of Lou's insurance photos, the t-shirts from the pep rally can be seen in the front seat of Jenna's car. Peter asks Chloe if those shirts can be purchased anywhere else such as the school store. She says no, that they are made specifically for the pep rally.

**(NOTE: it is assumed that at least another day has passed because they are all wearing different clothes in these scenes.)**

# [January 26th 2018 (assumed)]

\-Peter and Sam confront Jenna. Peter asks why the t-shirts from the pep rally were in her car, and Jenna confesses to doing the Shit Launcher, but that she is not the Turd Burglar. She claims she was blackmailed by someone named ""Brooke Wheeler"", but then quickly leaves due to being ""too stoned.""

\-Sometime later, Jenna agrees to sit down for a formal interview after giving herself time to get less high. Here, she talks about meeting Brooke Wheeler, and how she forced her to do the Shit Launcher.

Losing weight sounds simple on paper‚Äîeat less, move more, and the scale should move in the right direction. 

But anyone who‚Äôs ever tried knows it isn‚Äôt that straightforward. The truth is, many beginners sabotage their own progress without even realizing it.

The weight loss mistakes beginners make often stem from misinformation, impatience, or simply trying to do too much too fast.

If you‚Äôve been struggling with slow progress, constant hunger, or frustrating plateaus, you might be guilty of one or more of these common pitfalls. 

The good news? With the right knowledge and small tweaks, you can avoid these mistakes, make your journey smoother, and finally see lasting results.

We‚Äôll introduce the 12 most common weight loss mistakes beginners make and give you practical, actionable strategies to steer clear of them. 

Whether your goal is dropping a few pounds or transforming your lifestyle, these tips will save you time, energy, and frustration.

# 1)) Relying Too Much on Restrictive Diets

One of the biggest weight loss mistakes beginners make is jumping onto the latest fad diet that promises quick results. 

Keto, juice cleanses, extreme low-carb, or no-sugar rules might seem appealing at first, but restrictive diets rarely work long-term. 

They often leave you feeling deprived, hungry, and frustrated. Worse, once you ‚Äúslip up,‚Äù you feel like you‚Äôve failed and may end up overeating.

Instead of cutting out entire food groups or slashing calories too low, focus on building a balanced diet that you can actually stick to. Sustainable changes always beat short-term fixes.

**Best Practices to Avoid This Mistake:**

* Build meals around lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.
* Allow yourself flexibility‚Äîyes, you can still enjoy a slice of pizza or dessert occasionally.
* Think long-term: ask yourself, ‚ÄúCan I see myself eating this way for the next year?‚Äù If the answer is no, rethink your approach.
* Use the **80/20 rule**: eat nutrient-dense foods 80% of the time and allow indulgences 20% of the time.

# 2)) Setting Unrealistic Expectations

Beginners often expect rapid results‚Äîlike losing 10 pounds in a week. While it‚Äôs tempting to chase fast weight loss, it usually leads to disappointment. 

When the scale doesn‚Äôt drop as quickly as expected, motivation fades.

Healthy, sustainable weight loss is typically **1‚Äì2 pounds per week**. It might not sound like much, but over the course of a year, that adds up to 50‚Äì100 pounds. 

Slow progress is still progress.

**Checklist for Realistic Goals:**

* Focus on habits, not just numbers (e.g., walking 30 minutes daily).
* Track non-scale victories like better sleep, more energy, or looser clothes.
* Set small milestones (5‚Äì10 pounds at a time) rather than chasing a huge number.
* Celebrate progress instead of perfection.

# 3)) Ignoring Strength Training

Many beginners think cardio is the fastest way to lose weight. While running or cycling burns calories, neglecting strength training is a big mistake. 

Cardio helps with fat loss, but building muscle boosts your metabolism, improves body composition, and prevents the dreaded ‚Äúskinny fat‚Äù look.

Lifting weights doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll bulk up. It means you‚Äôll tone, tighten, and burn more calories even at rest.

**How to Incorporate Strength Training:**

* Aim for 2‚Äì4 weight training sessions per week.
* Focus on compound movements like squats, deadlifts, push-ups, and rows.
* Use progressive overload (increase weights or reps over time).
* Mix cardio and strength training for the best results.

# 4)) Overestimating Calories Burned

A common beginner mistake is thinking you can ‚Äúout-exercise‚Äù a poor diet. You burn fewer calories than you think during workouts, and fitness trackers often exaggerate calorie burn. 

For example, a 45-minute jog might burn 400 calories, but one burger and fries could easily wipe that out.

**Tips to Avoid Overestimation:**

* Don‚Äôt eat back all the calories your tracker says you‚Äôve burned.
* Focus on food quality, not just calories.
* Remember: exercise is for health, fitness, and strength‚Äînot just burning calories.

# 5)) Skipping Meals

Skipping meals seems like a good idea to cut calories, but it often backfires. When you skip breakfast or lunch, you‚Äôre more likely to overeat later in the day. 

This leads to poor food choices and calorie overload.

Your body works best when it gets steady fuel throughout the day. Skipping meals can also slow down your metabolism and increase cravings for high-sugar, high-fat foods.

**Ideas to Fix This Mistake:**

* Have a protein-packed breakfast (eggs, Greek yogurt, smoothies).
* Prep simple snacks like nuts, fruit, or boiled eggs to avoid skipping.
* Eat smaller, balanced meals every 3‚Äì4 hours to keep energy stable.

# 6)) Drinking Calories Without Realizing It

Another major **weight loss mistake beginners make** is underestimating the impact of liquid calories. Soda, fancy coffee drinks, smoothies, and even fruit juices can add hundreds of calories without making you feel full.

**Examples of Sneaky Calories:**

* A Starbucks Frappuccino: 400‚Äì600 calories.
* A large soda: 200+ calories.
* ‚ÄúHealthy‚Äù smoothies: 300‚Äì500 calories.

**Best Practices:**

* Drink water, sparkling water, or unsweetened tea.
* If you love coffee, stick to black or add a splash of milk.
* Save calories for food that keeps you full, not drinks that leave you hungry.

# 7)) Not Sleeping Enough

Lack of sleep doesn‚Äôt just make you tired‚Äîit makes you hungrier. Sleep deprivation raises cortisol (a stress hormone) and disrupts hunger hormones like ghrelin and leptin. 

The result? 

More cravings, poor self-control, and slower fat loss.

**Sleep Hacks:**

* Aim for 7‚Äì9 hours of quality sleep each night.
* Keep a consistent bedtime schedule.
* Limit screens an hour before bed.
* Create a relaxing bedtime routine (reading, stretching, meditation).

# 8)) Obsessing Over the Scale

The scale can be misleading. Water retention, hormones, and even salty meals can cause daily fluctuations. 

Beginners often get discouraged when the scale doesn‚Äôt reflect their effort.

**Better Ways to Track Progress:**

* Take body measurements (waist, hips, thighs).
* Track progress photos every 2‚Äì4 weeks.
* Notice improvements in stamina, energy, and clothing fit.
* Use the scale as one tool‚Äînot the only tool.

# 9)) Eating Too Little

Cutting calories too drastically may seem smart, but it slows down your metabolism and makes weight loss harder. 

Your body holds onto fat as a survival mechanism when calories are too low.

**Signs You‚Äôre Eating Too Little:**

* Constant fatigue and low energy.
* Extreme hunger or binge eating.
* Trouble sleeping.
* Plateaus despite low calorie intake.

**Best Practices:**

* Use a calculator to find your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).
* Eat at a moderate calorie deficit (250‚Äì500 calories less than maintenance).
* Focus on nutrient-dense foods rather than starving yourself.

# 10)) Not Drinking Enough Water

Dehydration is a silent progress killer. Many beginners mistake thirst for hunger, leading to unnecessary snacking. Water also supports digestion, metabolism, and energy levels.

**Hydration Tips:**

* Aim for at least 8 glasses (2 liters) of water per day.
* Drink a glass before each meal.
* Carry a reusable water bottle with you everywhere.
* Flavor water with lemon, cucumber, or mint if plain water is boring.

# 11)) Ignoring Mindful Eating

Eating in front of the TV, scrolling on your phone, or rushing through meals leads to overeating. 

Beginners often eat too quickly and don‚Äôt give their bodies time to register fullness.

**Mindful Eating Practices:**

* Put your fork down between bites.
* Chew slowly and enjoy the flavors.
* Stop eating when you‚Äôre 80% full.
* Avoid distractions‚Äîfocus on your meal.

# 12)) Quitting Too Soon

Perhaps the most common **weight loss mistake beginners make** is giving up too early. They expect fast results, hit a plateau, and assume the plan isn‚Äôt working. 

The truth is, weight loss isn‚Äôt linear. Progress comes with ups and downs.

**How to Stay Consistent:**

* Focus on building habits, not chasing perfection.
* Expect setbacks and learn from them.
* Surround yourself with support (friends, groups, coaches).
* Keep a journal to remind yourself why you started.

# Conclusion

Losing weight is not about perfection‚Äîit‚Äôs about consistency. By avoiding these 12 common weight loss mistakes beginners make, you‚Äôll set yourself up for long-term success. 

The goal isn‚Äôt just dropping pounds‚Äîit‚Äôs creating a lifestyle you can stick to.

Here's a new edition of ""Actors at the Box Office"", which seeks to explore the actors' trajectory at the box office and analyze their hits and bombs. I already talked about Robert De Niro last week, and as I promised, it's Al Pacino's turn.

#**Early Life**

Since he was young, Pacino was already expressing interest in acting. In this period, he was often unemployed or homeless, and sometimes slept on the street, in theaters, or at a friend's home. He started working on plays, and those attracted interest; Martin Bregman saw one of his plays and became Pacino's manager. Bregman got him an appearance on TV, before helping him start in the film industry.

#**1970s: The Best Decade for Any Actor?**

After a supporting role in *Me, Natalie*, Bregman helped Pacino land his first leading role in *The Panic in Needle Park* in 1971. While it didn't make a big impression at the box office, critics noted Pacino's range as one of the film's strengths. They were ready to see him in more things.

Well, that didn't actually take long.

Paramount was betting high on *The Godfather*, already securing Marlon Brando to play Vito Corleone. But as the filming dates were getting close, there was no actor for Michael Corleone. Paramount executives wanted a popular actor, either Warren Beatty or Robert Redford, while producer Robert Evans wanted Ryan O'Neal to receive the role. But Francis Ford Coppola wanted Pacino, as he could picture him roaming the Sicilian countryside, and wanted an unknown actor who looked like an Italian-American.

*The Godfather* subsequently became the most acclaimed film of the year, and also became the biggest film at the box office. Obviously, the biggest name was Brando. But it introduced the world to the talents of Pacino. He also earned his first Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Role. It was all just beginning for him.

Not wasting any minute, Pacino started booking more roles that could show his talents. His next film as lead, *Scarecrow* (with Gene Hackman), was another success. That same year, he got another acclaimed project: *Serpico* by Sidney Lumet. That was an even bigger hit, and was a critical darling. For this film, he got his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor.

So *The Godfather* made a huge impact... but now Pacino faces a new challenge: he's the leading star of the sequel. And he was not initially interested; he told Coppola he had a lot of problems with the script and refused to participate. So Coppola spent an entire night rewriting it before giving it to Pacino for his review. Pacino approved it and the production went forward.

Even though the film dropped from the original at the box office, it still earned insanely high praise. But the biggest praise was for Pacino; even to this day, many consider this to be his finest performance. It won 6 Oscars, including Best Picture. But in a very controversial decision, Pacino lost Best Actor to Art Carney for *Harry and Tonto*, and this has plagued the Academy for decades.

He teamed up again with Lumet on *Dog Day Afternoon*. But he turned down the role 3 times, even when Martin Bregman said he wanted him so many times. He said that he would ""never make the adjustment necessary for the movies"". But Pacino returned to the project, and attributed his behavior to stress and drinking, and that he needed ""a life outside work."" It was another critical and commercial hit, with Pacino getting another Best Actor nomination.

Through the rest of the decade, he worked with Sydney Pollack on *Bobby Deerfield* and with Norman Jewsion on *...And Justice for All*, both of which were successful. The latter got him another Best Actor nomination. So he capped off an absolute incredible decade, which is a huge contender for the best acting decade for any star. After all, it's rare to see an actor deliver these kind of acclaimed roles in such quick succession.

#**1980s: ¬°Saluden a mi amiguito!**

The 80s were interesting, cause it's the decade where Pacino worked the least. He only had 5 films in this decade. And it was a very mixed bag.

His first film was William Friedkin's *Cruising*, where he plays a NYPD detective hunting a serial killer who targets gay men. Even though they were both highly respected, it was a very complicated production as the two clashed. Friedkin has said that he was disappointed with Pacino's lack of professionalism during the shoot, claiming that he was often late and did not add any ideas to the character or to the film. On the other hand, Pacino has said that Friedkin did not let him know how to interpret the end of the film, saying, ""Am I the killer at the end of the picture or have I gone gay? To this day I don't know because Friedkin never told me how to play my final scene.""

Well, whatever the case, *Cruising* was a financial failure. And despite both known for prestige titles, it earned poor reviews on its initial release. Its reputation grew as the years passed, but it's not widely considered a great film.

He decided to try something more comedic with *Author! Author!*, although that didn't really light up the box office.

One day, Pacino was at the Tiffany Theater, watching 1932 version of *Scarface*. Fascinated, he contacted Martin Bregman, telling him he wanted to star in a remake. Initially offered to Sidney Lumet, Bregman got Brian De Palma as the director. Pacino worked with experts in knife combat, trainers and boxer Roberto Dur√°n to attain the body type that he wanted for the role. Despite so much controversy over its graphic violence, the film was a financial success. And Tony Montana was one of Pacino's most iconic roles, becoming popular with a lot of young viewers (for the wrong reasons).

But in 1985, Pacino faced a big disaster. It was called *Revolution*, a Revolutionary War epic. Costing $28 million ($84 million adjusted), the film earned... just $358,574. One of the biggest failures of the 80s, for it had a very rushed production. It also earned horrible reviews, with Pacino getting the rare comments where his performance lacked depth. He took this failure very seriously, for he went into a 4-year hiatus.

At the very least, Pacino closed the 80s on a good note: *Sea of Love* became his first film as leading man to gross more than $100 million worldwide.

#**1990s: ""Cause she got a... GREAT ASS. AND YOU GOT YOUR HEAD ALL THE WAY UP IT!""**

1990 was a bit weird. He starred in *The Last Stigmatic*, a film that would not see the light of the day until it hit DVD a decade later. He followed it up with a villain role in Warren Beatty's *Dick Tracy*, another successful film that got him another Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

He also reprised his role of Michael Corleone for *The Godfather Part III*, for which he got a $8 million salary ($19.8 million adjusted). But while it was a financial success, it didn't come anywhere close to the acclaim from the prior films. Unlike the other films, Pacino wasn't nominated for an Oscar here.

He followed it up with *Frankie and Johnny*, which reunited him with Michelle Pfeiffer, and was another success. Afterwards, he was part of the iconic *Glengarry Glen Ross*, although that didn't fare well at the box office. In fact, at that point, it was his least attended film in all of his career.

Pacino then starred in *Scent of a Woman*, playing a blind U.S. Colonel. He took an insane amount of preparation and research for his role, like how could a blind man sit or light a cigar. The film was a big success, earning $130 million worldwide. He earned his 8th Oscar nomination, but after so many attempts and losses, he finally won Best Actor for this role. Like it or not, the Legend finally got his due.

He later reteamed with Brian De Palma on *Carlito's Way*, although the film was only a modest performer. And *Two Bits* was dumped by Miramax, becoming his worst performer. But he recovered by starring in *Heat*, where he shared scenes with Robert De Niro for the first time (while they worked in *The Godfather Part II*, their characters were never on the same scene).

*City Hall* was a film that existed. But in 1997, he brought *Donnie Brasco* and *The Devil's Advocate* to over $100 million worldwide. He ended the decade with two films: *The Insider*, which was a critical success but a financial failure; and *Any Given Sunday*, which fared better at the box office but was deemed a critical disappointment.

#**2000s: Creative Slump**

Pacino decided to move into filmmaking, directing the film *Chinese Coffee*, which stars him and Jerry Orbach. But the film simply... doesn't exist at all. It never played in theaters, and it's difficult to find it on streaming.

Afterwards, he starred in Christopher Nolan's *Insomnia*, which was another $100 million success. But *Simone* was a failure, while *People I Know* was dumped by Miramax. And while *The Recruit* was a modest success, his name is now affiliated to the colossal disaster that was *Gigli* (even if his role is not big).

He followed this up with some mixed bags. *The Merchant of Venice*, *Two for the Money* and *88 Minutes* were financial misfires. But he got to play the antagonist role in *Ocean's Thirteen*, which became his highest grossing film. He capped off the decade with the forgettable *Righteous Kill*; for something pairing him and De Niro, absolutely no one remembers that movie.

#**2010s: It's Not Al Anymore... It's Dunk!**

Well pals, here it is. You knew it was coming.

So Pacino had $50 million in his bank account. But some over-spending and Ponzi schemes later, he had nothing. Yeah, there was a period where Pacino was broke. So because he had nothing else, Pacino accepted an offer from Adam Sandler to play a supporting role in his comedy, *Jack and Jill*. The result? One of the worst films ever released, even as it made almost $150 million. He also managed to win the Razzie for Worst Supporting Actor for this film.

But Pacino is content with the film, ""It came at a time in my life that I needed it, because it was after I found out I had no more money. My accountant was in prison, and I needed something quickly. So I took this. There‚Äôs this thing I do in that film: They got me doing a Dunkin‚Äô Donuts commercial. You know how many people think I actually made that commercial?""

So hey, we got that glorious Dunkaccino. Even though the commercial should actually be titled ""Dunk Pacino"", but that would require the lazy production to give a fuck about consistency. And if you've got a copy of the film... burn it. Did you lend it to someone? They must be found and talked to.

Through the decade, he went with smaller-scale films, so most of these flopped or didn't even get a theatrical release.

But at the very least, he had a strong 2019. He had a supporting role in *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*, which became his highest grossing film. But his real performance that year was in Martin Scorsese's *The Irishman*, playing the iconic Jimmy Hoffa. Even though he was associated with criminal characters, Pacino never worked with Scorsese before this. Scorsese said, ""For me, Al was always something unreachable. We even tried to make a film in the 1980s but couldn't get the financing for it. I said, 'What's he like to work with?' Bob [De Niro] said, 'Oh, he's great. You'll see.'"" A critical success, it got Pacino another Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, his first nom in 27 years.

#**2020s: Paycheck Era**

There was a lot of slop this decade.

With the exception of *House of Gucci*, he hasn't made a single notable film this decade. Have any of you heard of *American Traitor: The Trial of Axis Sally*? *Knox Goes Away*? *The Ritual*?

I guess we could call this ""The 'I don't give a fuck' Era"".

#**The Verdict**

For the 20th century, Pacino proved to be a very reliable box office draw. Not to the extent of other megastars of those decades (not even his equal Robert De Niro), but his presence was known to draw interest. It's crazy seeing how quickly he began: *The Godfather* was just his second film. There was no wasting time: he quickly proved his leading man status with *Part II*, *Serpico*, *Dog Day Afternoon*, and so many other films.

He is without a doubt, one of the finest stars to ever exist. His performance in *The Godfather Part II* is a big contender for the greatest performance (or at least in a Top 10). You can take any scene from the film to show as ""the best of the film"" and you wouldn't be wrong about it. There's so much tension, rage, coldness and betrayal in that performance. Those eyes, man.

Pacino has often been accused of hamming up his performances, particularly from the 90s onwards. You can see its origins in *Scarface*: nearly all his dialogues are all delivered in an over-the-top manner. Going from very silent but powerful moments to outright yelling as if his characters were coked up. But there are cases where that works for the film's benefit: his character in *Heat* is a cokehead (even if it's never told or seen) and he perfectly encapsules his state of mind. And it's not like he did it all the time; he still gave committed but grounded performances in *Donnie Brasco*, *The Insider*, *Insomnia*, and *The Irishman*.

Unfortunately, on the 21st century, something changed for Pacino and it's hard to say it was for the best. The good films started becoming less frequent and there were even points were he's not even interested in the film itself. And the flops became more common and more expensive. Some films didn't even hit theaters. Some not even streaming. Now he holds the honor of appearing in two of the worst films ever made (*Gigli* and *Jack and Jill*). It's hard for a well-respected actor to achieve it, especially when he has delivered his best work already. And this might not be up there in the write-up, but his best credits have been on TV over the past 2 decades. Stuff like *Angels in America*, *You Don't Know Jack* or *Phil Spector* show he still has it.

But we have to mainly discuss Dunkaccino. Yes, absurd and bizarre. Yes, absolutely no one in the production paid attention to the continuity or logic (IT'S DUNK PACINO, NOT DUNKACCINO). Yes, there wasn't a single laugh despite the amount of jokes. Yes, it warrants all the disdain it has garnered. But there's something about Pacino's role in that film that feels... captivating. He doesn't phone it in, is willing to take a good joke, and you can tell he's the only person in the cast that actually put some effort. Obviously, getting that paycheck was important (I already explained why he took that role), but he could have easily sleep his way through it. But the end result is an eerily bizarre performance with a cherry on top. You may not remember a single damn thing about this film (lucky you), but it's 100% a fact that you definitely remember Dunkaccino. 40 years of acting credits led to this moment, ladies and gentlemen.

Now I'm gonna ask the very tough question... Pacino or De Niro?

Im so silly :3"" but im genuinely struggling to focus that I need to multitasking to get one fucking thing done. Even cleaning, I have to plan what ill do, for how long, and make sure the music is set right that I dint get distracted or forget wth im doing (which has happened. I left the full mop bucket in the bath tub then spent all day tweaking out bc I thought I put it in the trash or smth).

 Its quite a fucking issue that I've been struggling with years to the point that in Highschool I had a teacher think I was lying about not having ADHD that she took me to the counselors office to find my paper work (that I didn't have). There was a rumor going on in the teachers lounge or smth bc WHAT

like ig it, ur trying to help and probably thought saying outloud in a class would embarrass me but...twin u just dragged a 15 year old to the counselor's office stating i have a neurological disability like u were trying to prove im spider-man. 

Not that I can't sit still (kinda) but she thought I was texting under my desk when I was actually crocheting in my bag so I can listen to her lecture. I can't read or listen to verbal instructions unless im doing something else that doesnt require thinking like untying a knot, picking my nails, or actually handy stuff like crochet. So many of my teachers and peers were surprised that I was not diagnosed but im really starting to think they're right. Even my dad suspected it at dinner once and I felt like Dexter surrounded by a gaggle of Doakes'

I was talking to another teacher during an exercise about coffee and I mentioned it makes me tired and she was like ""oh thats ur ADHD"" and I said ""i don't have adhd...."" and she stopped dead in her tracks like I just said the moon was made of cheese, stared at me and was like ""ur not...?"" 

IS THIS BREAKING NEWS??? DO U KNOW SMTH I DONT!?! WHATS GOING ON?!?!

Even now, im struggling just to read a few pages for an assignment in college bc I need text to speech to actually digest the information but not too much or ill be distracted so im making the world's largest granny square so my hands are distracted and some weird part of my brain shuts off so I can retain any information I need for my response bc I REFUSE to use AI to write my essays. Idc if it takes 4 weeks, this will be done by MY hands.

Its such a fucking problem 

And I dont want to get diagnosed (hear me out)

like ofc it'll help but as a black woman in a (mostly white) male dominated major, im cooked if I have a neurological disability legally on paper for ppl to use against me rather than just a rumor or compelling hypotheses. like u can say ADHD all u want. u can't prove itü§®

Im struggling big time with it and idk if ill just go mad and never know or find a neurologist or psychologist or SOME ologist to get me diagnosed and on some meds so I can do simple shit. Its genuinely pissing me off how little I can control my brain from either getting easily distracted or locking in so hard that i didnt even lock in. IT TOOK 2 DAYS TO DO A 2 HOUR ASSIGNMENT BC I HAVING TO REREAD, LOOK UP SHIT, GET DISTRACTED BY WHAT I LOOKED UP, AND ###########

im quite upset and I drank coffee bc I needed sugar but now im tired and I might need to email my professors for extensions despite the year just starting. This cannot continue like this",3,1757791366.0,rant,0,1.0,False
1ng6bio,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHome/comments/1ng6bio/which_wool_scarf_is_ideal_for_everyday_wear/,Which wool scarf is ideal for everyday wear?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience with wool scarves since winter is approaching and I've spent countless hours researching and trying different ones. Trust me, finding the perfect wool scarf isn't as simple as it might seem.

I used to think all wool scarves were basically the same until I started paying attention to the details. The material composition makes a huge difference in comfort and durability. Pure merino wool scarves are incredibly soft and don't cause that annoying itchy feeling that cheaper wool blends do.

After trying several options, I found this amazing wool scarf (https://athometouch.com/wool-scarf) that's become my go-to for daily wear. It's lightweight enough for fall but warm enough for winter, which is exactly what you want for everyday use.

Here's what I've learned about choosing the perfect wool scarf:

1. Look for fine merino wool - it's softer and more comfortable against your skin
2. Check the weave - tighter weaves last longer
3. Consider the length - around 70 inches works best for various styling options
4. Pay attention to care instructions - some are machine washable, others aren't

The best part about a quality wool scarf is its versatility. You can dress it up for work or keep it casual for weekend coffee runs. I've had mine for over a year now, and it still looks brand new despite almost daily use.

If you're on the fence about investing in a good wool scarf, I highly recommend checking out this one (https://athometouch.com/wool-scarf). It hits all the right notes in terms of quality, comfort, and style. Plus, it's actually reasonably priced considering how long it'll last.

A few extra tips for maintaining your wool scarf:
- Store it folded, not hung
- Air it out between wears
- Avoid heavy perfumes or colognes directly on the fabric
- Brush it occasionally to maintain its softness

I've found that paying a bit more upfront for a quality piece saves money in the long run since you won't need to replace it every season. Plus, wool naturally regulates temperature and resists odors, making it perfect for everyday wear.

For the kitchen:

Black tiles instead of red, black washing machine, black kettle and other storage containers on the work top also in black. Handles on cupboards and drawers black too please.

For the living room:

A Cream corner sofa on the left hand side and a matching chair / giant bean bag chair on the right hand side. Also not opposed to these being the other way around, depending what works best.

Adding a coffee table similar to the one below colour-wise, and also matching up the tv stand and bookcase with that. Would also like to add a few plants dotted around here and there.

1ng676m,https://i.redd.it/lc4ci4i8dzof1.jpeg,Snell's Law showing up in street prices,"You know the classical high-school optimization problem where in two different areas, with two different prices, you need to build street/wire/rails to get from point A to point B? Well i tried solving that for the general case, with arbitrary geometry and prices, and as it turns out, Snell's Law comes up! Only instead of the refractive index being the constant multiplying the sin/cos of the angle, its the price per meter of road that is the constant!

I was pretty amazed at the fact that it doesn't depend on the geometry of the problem at all, only insofar as it changes the angle theta2, but still, pretty neat!

I know just as I'm optimizing the cost, Snell's law is sort of an optimization on the time spent traveling/minimization of the Action (it all becomes related and complicated once you go into higher meanings, in some senses the minimization then becomes of proper time, or Einstein-Hilbert Action, or whatever idk), but it still is kinda nice.

The math I'm showing here is really only the ""clean"" short version of the derivation, theres some more pages of algebra and trigonometric identities, if anybody would like them.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Acetli, Overwhelmed Geneticist***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 30th, 2136*

My waking routine since getting a new job had essentially been established. I would slip out of bed, make a meal and watch some videos about AI or statistics, and then spend some time outside (which usually ended with a chat with Stocine).

Once I left my apartment, I‚Äôd put on my headphones and listen to music during the bus ride. I might chat with a few people before my final stop, and then I would go to work feeling quite content with a pleasurable wake claw.

However, if I was particularly unlucky, someone would shout at me just as I would be nearing the front doors, threatening to spoil my calculated routine.

‚ÄúAcetli! Hey!‚Äù someone shouted at me, just as I was nearing the front doors. It was Tanerik, jogging towards me, ridiculous head tuft bouncing all the way.

‚ÄúHello, Tanerik,‚Äù I greeted once he was closer. ‚ÄúHow was your journey here? You take the bus, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúI actually took a taxi this time!‚Äù he gasped, out of breath. He pulled open the door and held it for me. ‚ÄúHad a very large malfunction with my first meal. At first I thought it was really lame because I had to spend money on a cab, but my driver turned out to be one of the coolest people I‚Äôve met.‚Äù

‚ÄúA taxi driver.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah! Really nice lady, but had one of the deepest, richest voices I‚Äôve ever heard from a Thafki. She worked in voiceover for a long time, and I could tell she was *good* at it. Now she‚Äôs retired and occasionally drives people around in her sweet ride when she feels like it. And it‚Äôs a *very sweet* ride, a Nevok import. The seats were heated *and cooled*.‚Äù

I waved a greeting to the receptionists, who didn‚Äôt seem happy at all to be working. I wondered why they always looked so grumpy whenever I saw them. I pressed the button to call the elevator. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine how much she spent on that.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe actually got it from a friend who moved off-world and couldn‚Äôt bring it with them. But yeah, she doesn‚Äôt do it for the money. Just drives around people whenever she wants to have a bit of fun. Interestingly, she actually drove someone here just a paw ago! A sad-looking Yotul, apparently. Funny coincidence.‚Äù

My ears perked up. ‚ÄúA Yotul?‚Äù

He laughed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just as surprised as she was when she brought it up. I didn‚Äôt pursue it, though. Was too busy asking her who else she‚Äôs talked to throughout her career. She got to work with Stef Jetzer!‚Äù

The elevator lifted us with a barely audible hum. ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, I‚Äôll tell you later. Have any luck with the Krakotl genome?‚Äù

*Of course he‚Äôd refuse to explain and then bring that up.* Tanerik had a special way of irritating me that I still didn‚Äôt entirely understand. He was nice enough to talk to‚Ä¶ in short doses. I replied, ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù

He nodded much like Doctor Scheele would, head-tuft bouncing. ‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôve all been there. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get it soon.‚Äù

We exited the elevator and entered the workroom. Bemlin was already sat down, as usual, and greeted us with a wave of a claw. I logged on to my computer.

After only a short moment, Bemlin cleared his throat. ‚ÄúI have something to request of you two.‚Äù

Tanerik answered, ‚ÄúWhat have you got, Bemlin?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou two should ask Andrew that he not wear his mask.‚Äù

Across desks, Tanerik and I exchanged glances.

Bemlin took on a judgmental stare. It was kind of intimidating; I‚Äôd never seen the Gojid express much emotion at all. It reminded me of how my Pops would look at me when I said something a tad too progressive for him. ‚ÄúIt would be a very thoughtful thing to do. You will be working with him for the foreseeable future, so I suggest doing it sooner than later. As an additional point, more humans are going to arrive before too long.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe seems fine wearing it,‚Äù Tanerik retorted. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm cool with faces.‚Äù

My ears nervously twitched. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve, um, seen their faces online, but this seems a little quick.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy is that?‚Äù Bemlin said. ‚ÄúIt has been several days.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ uh, I don‚Äôt know. He‚Äôs just very tall and‚Ä¶ imposing.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe wears it for your comfort. I hope you do not consider his unimportant.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! Of course not.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell then.‚Äù Bemlin said. ‚ÄúNo one would force you. But he would appreciate it more than you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf he‚Äî‚Äù I stopped myself at the sound of loud, recognizable footsteps.

‚ÄúGood morning, you two,‚Äù Doctor Scheele greeted, walking in. Like usual, the first thing he did was go to the coffee machine to prepare a batch. ‚ÄúAnybody want coffee?‚Äù

I glanced at the Gojid, but he was looking at his screen like nothing had happened.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take some. Also, do you like wearing that mask?‚Äù Tanerik blurted, prompting me to gawk at him. ‚ÄúBecause if you do, that‚Äôs cool, but I just figured I‚Äôd point out that you don‚Äôt have to wear it for my sake. I mean, as long as Acetli‚Äôs okay with it.‚Äù

I felt my face and ears grow warm. I was going to have a *very* serious talk with that wool tuft-given-thought later. ‚ÄúNo! I-I mean, uh, not ‚Äòno‚Äô to removing your mask, I‚Äôm fine with it. Yep. Totally fine with it. But, uh, maybe not‚Ä¶ *right at this moment?‚Äù* I added, my voice climbing in pitch to a squeak.

Doctor Scheele regarded both of us, then Bemlin. With how long he remained silent, part of me *did* become curious about what was going on behind that mask. From all the news content I'd absorbed, human faces were the primary method they expressed anything.

*But Doctor Scheele waves his lanky arms around plenty enough while he talks. Keeping his mask on can‚Äôt be the worst thing. It‚Äôd only be like taping my ears to the back of my head‚Ä¶*

Maybe Bemlin was right‚Ä¶ but I could admit that later.

‚ÄúUm, okay,‚Äù Doctor Scheele finally said. ‚ÄúI appreciate the thought and I‚Äôll keep it in mind, but, uh‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll just keep it on for now.‚Äù

I silently thanked the stars. Bemlin commented, ‚ÄúSo long as everyone is as comfortable as they can be.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnyways, coffee?‚Äù Scheele offered.

Tanerik and Bemlin requested the beverage like usual, while I declined.

‚ÄúYou really should try it sometime,‚Äù Tanerik told me, unaware of my internal struggle. ‚ÄúLast paw I went to one of those human places that have been popping up and tried this type of coffee called ‚Äòespresso‚Äô. Oh man, two of those and it was like I could see the future. My paws started shaking, too.‚Äù

I straightened my ears. ‚ÄúTanerik, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs supposed to happen.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, definitely not. Didn‚Äôt get very much of a sleep claw. Anyway, I decided my first paycheck is going towards ordering a coffee machine. By the way, Doctor Scheele? When is our first paycheck?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, good question.‚Äù The human fiddled with the machine. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs around January fifth? Maybe earlier? In roughly five-ish days, er‚Ä¶ six-ish paws? I don‚Äôt know. Timekeeping on this planet is weird to me still. You could ask Nalek.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs that soon, I‚Äôll put it on credit,‚Äù Tanerik decided. He turned to Bemlin. ‚ÄúDid you find the genome database we‚Äôre going to move forward with?‚Äù

Bemlin hardly reacted. ‚ÄúNo. It is very early in the work day.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll the better! Oh, also, after I drank those two espressos, I did some jittery web searching and found one we could use. It‚Äôs older than me by about ten years, but it should be fine.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶How old are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúCoffee‚Äôs done,‚Äù Doctor Scheele announced. He yawned, and lifted his mask slightly to take a lazy sip of his coffee. While the others got up to get their caffeinated beverage, Scheele tapped at his pad. ‚ÄúOh, Acetli! I just glanced at the jobs you put on the server last paw and it reminded me of what I wanted to do first.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid the results of the Krakotl genome look good?‚Äù I asked.

He took a seat and haphazardly set his coffee down. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt check that. I might have time later, do you want me to?‚Äù

It would‚Äôve been incredibly easy to ask for the human‚Äôs help, right there, but I wanted to ensure it was perfect before it reached his eyes. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm still‚Ä¶ fiddling with it.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù He shrugged, then turned to the other two. ‚ÄúHow is the progress coming along with the five genes we did find?‚Äù

Tanerik‚Äôs ears perked up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty exciting! We looked at six unique genome assemblies, and the five unknown genes found come up in *all* of them! We‚Äôve also found that, across a tiny sample set of about four thousand Gojid individuals, the allelic polymorphic frequency is *higher* in those three genes without introns than in the other two. It‚Äôs *very slight,* but it might be noteworthy. The software also said something about a ‚Äòp-value‚Äô? No idea what that means.‚Äù

‚Äú*Four thousand* is tiny? Send the results over, I‚Äôll take a look,‚Äù he replied, pulling out his stylus to take notes.

My ears perked up at that, too. The first part of what he said made it unlikely that the unknown genes were a fluke since it popped up in more than just one genome, which didn‚Äôt help the argument I‚Äôd been trying to make.

However, the second part did quite the opposite. It meant that the intronless genes were more susceptible to their sequences being different from person to person, which meant those regions were *probably* not very important; genes need a coherent sequence to achieve the proper function. I relished the fact that I actually had some evidence to back up my claim.

‚ÄúSo that means they‚Äôre not important,‚Äù I stated. ‚ÄúAny important sequence wouldn‚Äôt have so much variation among a population.‚Äù

‚ÄúAny *currently* important sequence,‚Äù the human corrected. ‚ÄúIf we assume for a second that these genes *do* have a function, what function would that be?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething worth hiding?‚Äù Tanerik guessed.

‚ÄúYes! Exactly! Something that could possibly be related to a *meat allergy*. But that‚Äôs where the issue is‚Ä¶ Bemlin, how long ago were Gojids inducted into the Federation?‚Äù

Bemlin had a faraway look. ‚ÄúIt has been over six hundred years.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo the last time any Gojid even *thought* about touching a piece of meat was six hundred years ago. Which meant there were at least fifteen generations‚Äîas a conservative estimate‚Äîbetween now and then.‚Äù

I was somewhat sickened by all this talk of flesh, but I, begrudgingly, saw where Doctor Scheele was going with this. My mouth still didn‚Äôt want to form the words. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ surely that doesn‚Äôt imply‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Bemlin clinically answered. ‚ÄúIt very likely means some genes related to the manufactured allergy would be more liable to become dormant.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù the human exclaimed. ‚ÄúAnd not just liable, but *actively selected against*. If someone doesn‚Äôt make it to adulthood because of a severe allergic reaction, then‚Ä¶ uh, you get the point. So, the higher variation of these genes‚Äô sequences among the population doesn‚Äôt mean they are less important, it means that they are probably *more* important.‚Äù

The chances that these genes were a fluke was eroding more every paw, to my chagrin.

‚ÄúAndrew,‚Äù Bemlin said, ‚Äúdid you find anything noteworthy in the structure files we sent you?‚Äù

The human‚Äôs excitement only slightly diminished. ‚ÄúNot really, not even in the ones simulated in extraphysiological conditions. The two with introns are folding normally, but those without them‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre tricky. Across the three, there was *maybe* a region that had a higher-than-random affinity for small polysaccharides, but it was so nonspecific and dependent on low temperatures it was basically useless. I also checked the structure of the RNA strand the sequence transcribed into, in case that had some kind of function, but that was even less helpful.‚Äù

‚ÄúRibozymes?‚Äù Bemlin stated. ‚ÄúThe software is capable of such predictions? I apologize, I did not know you wished to analyze anything related to RNA.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs capable of a lot more than that still. I know I didn‚Äôt tell you to look at those, though I might have you two check them moving forward. And‚Ä¶ I feel like I was going to ask you to do something else with them, but I can‚Äôt seem to remember‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWe could look for sulfide bonds with likely proteins, I saw that while reading about Gamma Fold,‚Äù Tanerik offered.

‚ÄúIt might be worth a try, but that‚Äôs not what I was thinking of‚Ä¶‚Äù Doctor Scheele rubbed his chin, then shook his head, giving up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll remember it at some point.‚Äù

Doctor Scheele might have been disappointed by the lack of progress in the genes‚Äô function, but it meant I still had one, single bastion of hope left. I spoke up, ‚ÄúOkay, so the genes *might be* more important because of polymorphisms, but we don‚Äôt know why or how, since the structure prediction isn‚Äôt resulting in anything.‚Äù

Doctor Scheele put his hand on his chin, beneath his mask. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still plenty of things to test. And there‚Äôs also the possibility of the sequences being epigenetic mechanisms. Regions that recruit transcription factors more favorably, leading to changes in other gene‚Äôs expression‚Ä¶ but then they wouldn‚Äôt technically be genes‚Ä¶ I wonder if there‚Äôs an issue with the genome assembly we referenced to train the AI‚Ä¶‚Äù

The human‚Äôs hand jittered across his holopad with such speed, I wondered if he could actually read whatever he was writing down. I found myself staring, somewhat in awe. Once again, my attempts to convince the human that his AI software was faulty didn‚Äôt result in an admission that I had been right all along. Rather, it had spurred the human into further scientific inquiry, to explore possibilities that I had never even considered.

I shook myself. Rosim had called the exact behavior I was now observing predatory. I shouldn‚Äôt want to engage with such things, but‚Ä¶ what harm was there in curious thought? Humans hadn‚Äôt eaten anyone. Perhaps Rosim was too wary, didn‚Äôt have the same drive that I sought.

‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶‚Äù Doctor Scheele drawled, evidently failing to draw enough brain power away from his note-taking. His mask eventually turned upward. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go sit down. I have to work this all out and look for some papers. I feel like we‚Äôre really close to something‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be in my office if you need me. Or maybe the greenhouse, I also need to check on the plants.‚Äù

He shuffled out of the room, intently staring at his pad the whole way. His coffee was left alone on the desk.

‚ÄúThe plants?‚Äù I asked once the human was gone, turning to Bemlin.

‚ÄúIt is a side project of his,‚Äù he answered. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs required to dedicate the majority of his time to the modifications study, but he‚Äôs mentoring a sharp individual who‚Äôs progressing the side project quite well.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know Doctor Scheele had experience with plants,‚Äù Tanerik said, greedily sipping at his cup of coffee. ‚ÄúWhat, did the Federation modify those, too?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the project about?‚Äù I asked, before Bemlin could even consider answering Tanerik‚Äôs absurd question.

‚ÄúI will refrain from delving into great detail, but it involves genetically modifying plants by using insights from those native to Venlil Prime. A continuation of his project on Earth, before we came here.‚Äù

That was very surprising to me. I hoped whoever it was was having an easier time working with the human than I was. *Why would Doctor Scheele involve himself in two completely different topics? Wait, Bemlin said ‚Äòbefore we came here‚Äô‚Ä¶?*

‚ÄúYou were on Earth?‚Äù Tanerik blurted, stealing the words straight from my mind. ‚ÄúDoes that mean‚Ä¶‚Äù

I gawked at Tanerik for saying it so brazenly.

‚ÄúIt means many things, yes,‚Äù Bemlin said, entirely unfazed. ‚ÄúLet us get to work, shall we?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight!‚Äù Tanerik said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to ask Scheele about his super secret plant stuff later.‚Äù

I looked between the two for any further reaction, but there was nothing. I sincerely hoped I hadn‚Äôt said anything inadvertently offensive to the refugee due to my ignorance, and he‚Äôd been too stoic or kind to rebuke me. I wondered if those two had any other excruciatingly important information that was apparently only worth a casual mention.

Should I meet him?","I was 15 (a girl) when I reached out to him. I was told the whole story by someone who used to be close to my mother and then I made my own research with other people that were present at the time. My father was a Russian immigrant here. He came with his siblings and their mother. No father. My mother is wealthy and he used to work for her family. Its a common practice in this neighbourhood even now - to have teenagers who work during the summer in people's yards - cleaning the pool, taking care of the garden and so on. That was what my dad was doing. His English was broken, elementary, I was told and he was working in my mother's yard. He and some of his siblings, I believe 2 sisters.

I was born a few days before he turned 18 and when he turned 18 he got married to my mother and she was very abusive. Controlling, possessive, made him limit and then cut contact with his family. He stayed married to her for 5 or 6 years. She caught him cheating with the woman his age that was babysitting me.

I reached out at 15 and he hesitantly agreed to meet but I had to take an adult with me and it was my mother. I only had my mother, grandma and my mother's boyfriend at the time. I talked with mother's brother but he said he doesn't want to see that "" spoiled Russian brat"" of my father again

She didn't get inside the coffee shop with me but looked at the interraction from the street and he kept looking at her. Wasn't comfortable at all. I look just like him. Blue eyes, light brown hair, thin and and tall. I couldn't believe how similar we are. He is married to someone. I was 15. I knew he has his reasons to avoid Mom but I felt so rejected. I brought him something I painted and wanted to get to know him while he was cold and distant and he made me feel like trash. We met again because I wanted it and he was warmer this time and asked me questions about me but didn't really want to tell me anything about his life.

In the end, even at 15, I felt he doesn't want me and I felt rejected so I wrote him a text on IG that I don't want to be a burden for him nor do I want him to keep in contact when he clearly doesn't want me. My text was so long and his reply was: You don't understand but I can't do this.

Now I am 19 and he reached out. Why? Should I give him a chance? he hurt me so much at 15. I was just a kid. Just wanted to know my Dad.

TLDR My dad was 17 when I was born and wants to meet again

Mother told me he cheated on her a lot and once hit her head against the table. I asked him about this and he admitted he did it. Because she didn't tell him and make sure he doesn't know that his mother died. And also that ex friend of her told me that Dad once was drunk and angry and crying and he ra...ped my Mom.

It's not until I have a health scare where I'll actually snap out of the bad habit, but a week or two later I fall back into the same routine (not drinking enough water, drinking a lot of coffee, not necessarily eating like shit but eating what/when I can, not prioritizing being active., etc).

I swear, reminders on a phone, a habit tracker, an app, whatever it is, just doesnt seem to work for me and my brain.

Then I have a health scare, anxiety flares up, attempt to take care of myself, feel better, fall off, rinse, repeat. This cycle is exhausting me and this isnt sustainable.

So, I recently had this super frustrating experience with my waffle maker that just wouldn't turn on, and I figured I'd share what I learned because, honestly, it drove me crazy for days.

First off, I know it sounds obvious, but check if it's properly plugged in. I spent 20 minutes troubleshooting mine only to realize the plug wasn't pushed in all the way (yeah, I felt pretty dumb). But there's actually a bunch of other reasons why your waffle iron might be giving you the cold shoulder.

One common issue is a tripped circuit breaker. This happened to me when I had my coffee maker and waffle iron running at the same time. These appliances can draw quite a bit of power, so check your breaker box if nothing's working.

Sometimes the problem is the power cord itself. Look for any visible damage, kinks, or fraying. If you spot any issues, it's probably time for a replacement. Safety first, right? No one wants an electrical fire over breakfast!

The internal thermostat could also be the culprit. These things regulate temperature and can wear out over time. If your waffle maker is pretty old, this might be your issue. When mine started acting up (different waffle maker), I actually found an awesome replacement on Amazon (https://athometouch.com/waffle-maker) that's been working like a charm.

Here's something people often miss - some waffle makers have a safety switch that prevents them from turning on if they're not properly closed. Make sure your waffle maker is sitting level and the plates are aligned correctly.

If you've tried everything and it's still not working, check if it's still under warranty. If not, you might want to consider a replacement. Modern waffle makers come with some pretty cool features - I recently got one from here (https://athometouch.com/waffle-maker) that has adjustable temperature controls and non-stick plates that make cleanup so much easier.

Quick pro tip: regardless of whether you fix your current one or get a new one, always let your waffle maker cool completely before storing it, and avoid wrapping the cord too tightly around it. This helps prevent internal damage and extends its life.

Remember, sometimes it's worth investing in a quality appliance rather than dealing with constant issues. Trust me, nothing beats the smell of fresh waffles on a Sunday morning when everything's working properly!

I‚Äôm a proud owner of a Sage Bambino Plus and Sage Smart Grinder Pro, coming up on a year now. Coffee making has turned into a real hobby for me. I‚Äôm pretty confident pulling a decent shot these days and I‚Äôm steadily improving my milk skills. My favourite drinks are a flat white or cortado.

Since getting the Bambino, I‚Äôve been working through lots of roasters via Sage‚Äôs own Beanz subscription service and have had some excellent freshly roasted beans.

Recently though, I was gifted a selection from Ueshima Coffee Company. They seem pretty well-established, and I‚Äôve gone through a few bags now and currently enjoying their Tokyo Roast.

Here‚Äôs my dilemma: as many of you know, Ueshima don‚Äôt provide roast dates. The beans are mass produced, supermarket-available, and gas-flushed for shelf life. Yet‚Ä¶I‚Äôm actually enjoying them. Part of me feels like I‚Äôm committing an espresso ‚Äúsin‚Äù by not sticking with freshly roasted beans, which was one of the reasons I got into this hobby in the first place.

To complicate things, a 250g bag of Ueshima costs about half the price of the freshly roasted beans I‚Äôd been buying.

So my question to you all is: Do you think it‚Äôs a big compromise to use beans without a roast date, even if I like the taste? Or should I just enjoy what I‚Äôm enjoying and not overthink it?

Would love to hear the community‚Äôs perspective. Be nice

My sister-in-law slapped me so hard at her graduation party that my ears rang for twenty minutes.

I know I deserved it. But sitting here three months later, cut off from my entire family and living in my car, I keep wondering if maybe I could have handled things differently.

It started when my husband and I were going through a rough patch. We'd been married six years, had a two-year-old daughter, and somewhere along the way we just stopped talking. He worked nights, I worked days. When we passed each other in the hallway, it felt like we were roommates sharing a mortgage.

His younger sister was finishing her nursing degree. She'd always been the golden child. Perfect grades, perfect job lined up at the hospital, perfect everything. Meanwhile, I dropped out of college when I got pregnant and never went back.

She started coming over more often to study. My husband would get home from his night shift and make her breakfast while she reviewed her notes at our kitchen table. They'd laugh about inside jokes from their childhood. He'd quiz her on medical terms. Normal sibling stuff, right?

Except one morning I came downstairs and found them hugging in the kitchen. Not a quick pat on the back kind of hug. A real hug. Her face buried in his chest, his hand on the back of her head.

""What the hell is this?"" I said.

They jumped apart. My husband looked confused. ""She just found out she passed her final exam. What's wrong with you?""

But I knew what I saw. The way she looked at him. The way he smiled at her. Something was going on.

That's when I made my first mistake. Instead of talking to my husband, I started talking to his friend from work. Just venting at first. He'd come over when my husband was at work and we'd drink wine and I'd complain about feeling invisible in my own marriage.

You can probably guess where this went.

The affair lasted two months. I told myself it was just physical, that it didn't mean anything, that I was just trying to feel wanted again. All the stupid things people tell themselves when they're doing something they know is wrong.

I found out I was pregnant right before my sister-in-law's graduation party. The timing was impossible. My husband and I hadn't slept together in four months.

I panicked. Instead of coming clean, I decided to create a distraction. If I could make everyone think my husband was having an affair with his sister, maybe they wouldn't notice when the baby came early. Maybe I could convince him we'd had a drunken night I barely remembered. Maybe, maybe, maybe.

The graduation party was at my mother-in-law's house. Fifty people crammed into her backyard, everyone fawning over the golden child. I'd had three glasses of wine and my hands were shaking.

I waited until she was opening presents, surrounded by the whole family.

""Must be nice,"" I said, loud enough for everyone to hear. ""Getting all this attention from everyone. Especially from married men.""

The backyard went quiet.

""What's that supposed to mean?"" she asked.

""You know exactly what it means. I see how you look at him. How you're always at our house. Always finding excuses to touch him.""

My husband stood up from his chair. ""Are you seriously doing this right now?""

""Someone needs to say it,"" I said. ""Everyone pretends not to notice, but I see it. The breakfast dates, the study sessions, the long hugs in my kitchen.""

My sister-in-law's face went white. Then red. ""You're insane.""

""Am I? Then why don't you tell everyone why you're really always at our house? Why you can't seem to stay away from my husband?""

That's when my husband laughed. Not a happy laugh. A bitter, angry laugh that made my stomach drop.

""You want to do this here?"" he said. ""Fine. Let's do this here. Tell them about your friend from work. Tell them about the nights you said you were at book club. Tell them about the credit card charges at that motel off the highway.""

The wine glass slipped from my hand and shattered on the patio.

""I don't know what you're talking about,"" I said.

""Three months ago you started acting weird about my sister coming over. You know what else happened three months ago? You started smelling like cologne that wasn't mine. You started hiding your phone. You started picking fights about nothing so you'd have an excuse to storm out.""

My mother-in-law stood up. ""What is going on?""

My husband pulled out his phone. ""I hired a private investigator last month. Want me to show everyone the photos? Or should we talk about the pregnancy test I found in the bathroom trash last week? The one you tried to hide under coffee grounds?""

I couldn't breathe. Everyone was staring at me.

""We haven't slept together since January,"" he continued. ""So either that baby is a miracle, or you've got some explaining to do.""

That's when my sister-in-law walked across the patio and slapped me. Hard. The sound echoed off the house.

""You tried to ruin my graduation because you're a lying cheat?"" she said. ""You tried to make people think I was inappropriate with my own brother because you couldn't keep your legs closed?""

I ran. Left the party, left my husband, left everything. He filed for divorce the next week. The paternity test confirmed what everyone already knew. My family won't talk to me. His family definitely won't talk to me. I lost my job because my affair partner worked there too and HR got involved.

My daughter stays with my husband full time now. I get supervised visits twice a week at a community center. She asks why she can't come to my new home and I can't tell her it's because I'm living in my car in a Walmart parking lot.

My sister-in-law is working at the hospital now. I saw her once at the grocery store and she walked right past me like I was invisible. My husband is dating someone new. A teacher from our daughter's preschool. My mom told me this in the one text she's sent me since the party.

I know I destroyed everything. I know the slap was justified. I know I'm the villain in this story. But sometimes I lie awake at night wondering if things would have been different if I'd just talked to my husband instead of assuming the worst. If I'd gone to therapy instead of another man's bed. If I'd come clean about the pregnancy instead of trying to destroy an innocent person.

AITA for wishing I could take it all back, even though I know I never can?

i asked reddit what to make.. favorite dishes they were craving. I took all the best parts of each dish combined and created something new. Its loaded spiralized fries with an arabian spice twist. The fried fried chicken bites are skin on and spiced like shawerma too, and fried breaded like kfc (kfc chicken also has skin).

I know that‚Äôs pretty normal but we‚Äôre at the point we‚Äôre barely even interacting with each other and we just hang around ALL THE TIME. That has to change. 
Just a couple years ago we would go to the springs (we‚Äôre from Florida), beach, parks galore. We were always doing something outside and they loved it and were always ready to go. Now they‚Äôve decided they hate swimming. They said they are sick of it from how much we‚Äôd swim when they were younger. I have a neurological condition that flares up severely in the heat so all the swimming was perfect and the main reason it was our main activity in the warmer months. But at 13 and 14, feeling awkward about their bodies in swimsuits and having periods, I don‚Äôt feel right about making them go swimming with me. In the cooler months I‚Äôll have them go hiking and camping at least occasionally, which they don‚Äôt totally hate, but I can‚Äôt do that for several months out of the year. And other than these things, I don‚Äôt have any ideas of how to spend time with them without spending a bunch of money. They‚Äôre down for shopping or going out to eat or getting iced coffee any day, any time. It seems like the only things to do around here cost money. That‚Äôs okay occasionally, but that‚Äôs not something we can do more than every once in a while anyway. I‚Äôve also always tried to ingrain in them that fun doesn‚Äôt equal spending money and I‚Äôm not wavering on that. They don‚Äôt give me any ideas because they don‚Äôt want to do anything as it, and I just feel stumped. 

So what do you do to spend time with your teenagers that don‚Äôt really want to spent time with you, or do anything but spend money? I don‚Äôt even care at this point if it‚Äôs their favorite thing or not. Help!

The sludge in my ceramic mug was a particularly potent vintage this morning, but it's free, so I drink it anyway.

""Leo! Over here! You're on the Deliverance Day committee.""

Anya's voice cut through the caffeine-deficient haze. I blinked. She was waving me into the main boardroom where a small, grim-looking group had assembled. I was the new guy on the forty-seventh floor of Kensey-Pryce Tower. My most significant achievement so far was finding the least malfunctioning elevator. Apparently I was already qualified to plan the office party for the day the world didn't end. Moving up fast.

""The‚Ä¶ what committee?"" I asked, sliding into a chair beside her. She nudged a plate of suspiciously uniform croissants toward me.

""Deliverance Day,"" she said, as if it were obvious. ""You know. The day the world didn't end. Only the most important holiday on the planet. Bigger than New Year's. Way bigger than Christmas. The sixtieth anniversary is this year. Corporate is a Platinum Sponsor. It's a huge deal.""

Right. Deliverance Day. The day the Three‚ÄîAtlas, Null, and Meridian‚Äîfinally put down the Devourer after decades of global carnage. The day we stopped being an all-you-can-eat buffet for a reality-bending horror that had spilled out of the Rift. And my job was to help plan the office party for it.

""Our theme,"" announced Sterling, our department head, ""is ‚ÄòUnity Through Adversity.'""

I nodded like this made perfect sense. ""Should the napkins reflect the unity or the adversity?""

""Custom ombr√©. Charcoal transitioning to cerulean. Focus-grouped.""

Of course they were.

""I still think a moment of silence for the millions who died would be more appropriate than a karaoke contest,"" murmured Anya.

""The karaoke contest,"" Sterling countered, without missing a beat, ""promotes brand engagement and inter-departmental cohesion. The silent reflection pod will be available in the wellness room for a scheduled thirty-minute window. Now, Leo, you'll be liaising with catering on canap√©s that are both celebratory and respectfully solemn.""

I nodded again, my mind already composing the email. Subject: Somber Mini-Quiches.

I tuned out and looked around the boardroom. A long, polished obsidian table reflected the recessed lighting. The far wall was a single, sweeping pane of reinforced glass, offering a dizzying view of a city of shimmering holographic ads and skyscrapers.

The only real reminders of the world we lived in now were the subtle safety features. A thin, phosphorescent yellow line on the floor marked the path to the emergency stairwell. A small plaque by the door glowed amber: *AMBER ZONE GRID: ACTIVE*. You saw them everywhere, like fire extinguishers. You ignored them until the moment you couldn't.

Sterling was still droning on when a low hum started. It was a vibration that came up through the soles of my shoes. I glanced at my mug. The dark surface of the coffee trembled, forming perfect concentric rings.

Anya noticed it too. Her easygoing demeanor tightened. ""Ground-shaker?"" she whispered.

Sterling paused, annoyed by the interruption. ""Maintenance is probably‚Äî""

He never finished the sentence.

**CRACK**

It felt like the building's spine had snapped. The magnificent pane of glass shattered, exploding inward in a crystalline shockwave.

Through the brand-new hole in our forty-seventh-floor office, a thing of jagged nightmares pulled itself in.

It was a mass of iridescent chitin and twitching, mismatched limbs. One arm was a bludgeoning club of bone, the other a pincer that snapped with unnerving speed. A thick, viscous ichor, the color of crude oil, dripped from its maw onto the plush carpet, sizzling on contact.

An Aberrant. A leftover scrap of the Devourer's reign. A walking reminder of why we had Deliverance Day committees in the first place.

Panic was a hot flood. Sterling was screaming. Then, from another wall, a second, controlled explosion blew a man-sized hole in the drywall.

A figure landed in a perfect three-point stance, clad in graphite-gray tactical armor. ""Civilians, remain calm!"" his voice boomed. ""Aegis is on site!""

The name registered. Aegis. One of the city's top-tier, government-sanctioned mutants‚Äîthe kind of hero they put on posters for the Deliverance Day galas. He was the real deal. He fired searing bolts of blue light from his gauntlets, slamming into the Aberrant's carapace. The monster shrieked, a sound like tearing metal, and lunged.

Aegis flexed. ""Have at thee!""

What followed was brutal and fast. But the creature was unnaturally strong. It swung its club-like arm, and Aegis had to catch the blow, his boots skidding back, gouging furrows in the floor.

""Fuck!"" Aegis grunted, the polished, PR-friendly voice gone, replaced by the raw strain of a man in a real fight. ""Alright then, you piece of shit‚Ä¶""

The Aberrant pressed its advantage, slamming him again and again, forcing him back toward the interior glass wall that separated the boardroom from the main office floor. My corner. I was frozen, trapped behind Anya, who was trying to pull me under the table.

Just as it seemed Aegis would be pulped against the glass, they arrived.

There was no explosion, no grand entrance. They moved through the dust and chaos from the main office space in silence, their movements economical and unnervingly calm. There were five of them, dressed in simple, dark-gray fatigues with no logos, no armor‚Äîjust utility vests packed with gear.

The man in the lead was of average height but had broad, powerful shoulders and arms that strained the fabric of his shirt. He had a handsome, rugged face framed by messy dark hair, but his eyes were ancient with exhaustion. Behind him, a tall, pale woman with striking features moved with a liquid grace, her hand raised slightly as if feeling the air. She whispered something, and the frantic scramble of our colleagues near the door seemed to quiet, to organize itself into a more orderly retreat.

Anya let out a shaky breath next to me. ""Thank God. It's *Corridor Risk Solutions*."" She pointed a trembling finger at the man. ""That's Chub's team.""

*Chub?*

The Aberrant, ignoring them completely, let out another shriek and, with a final, heaving shove, hurled Aegis's armored body directly at the glass panel I was crouched behind.

This is it, I thought, my life flashing before my eyes in a slideshow of unfiled tax forms.

I am so, so quitting after today.

But one of the newcomers, a stocky man with a thick red beard, was already there. He didn't brace for impact. He didn't even look strained. He simply stepped forward and placed the palm of his hand flat against the center of the glass panel.

The glass shimmered, turning opaque‚Äîbecoming something else entirely.

Aegis's two hundred fifty pounds of man and metal hit the pane with a sound I will never forget. It wasn't the sharp crack of breaking glass. It was a deep, dull, leaden THUMP, like a side of beef hitting a concrete floor. It held.

Aegis's armored form, all momentum spent, slid down the surface with a greasy squeal, leaving a smear on the perfectly intact pane.

The Aberrant paused, its cluster of eyes blinking in what looked like genuine confusion. It had expected a bloody mess, not a physics-defying thud. The momentary hesitation was all Aegis needed. Roaring with frustration, he launched himself off the wall and tackled the creature, driving it back through the hole it had made. The sounds of their battle receded down the side of the building.

The CRS team didn't follow. Their job, apparently, wasn't the monster. It was us. The tall, thin one with kind eyes was already directing people out. A petite woman‚Äîso delicate she looked like she might break‚Äîknelt beside Sterling, checking him for injuries with a practiced calm. The red-bearded man took his hand off the glass, which now looked like a normal pane again. He flexed his fingers, wincing slightly.

The leader, the one with the tired eyes, surveyed the room. His gaze swept over the damage, the terrified accountants, and finally landed on me, still huddled on the floor. He walked over, his boots crunching softly on the crystalline dust. Up close, I could see the uneven tone of his skin‚Äîpale in some places and darker in others, like old bruises that never quite faded.

""You alright, kid?"" he asked, his voice a low baritone, rough around the edges.

I could only nod, my throat tight. ""Who‚Ä¶ who are you guys?""

""CRS."" He offered a half-smile that didn't quite reach his weary eyes. He glanced at the Kensey-Pryce logo on the wall, then back at me.

""If your coverage is good, you folks won't even see the bill,"" he added, a glint of dark humor in his expression. ""If not‚Ä¶ well, we'll itemize.""",4,1757789853.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

She was a sunbeam, with a cascade of platinum blonde hair that seemed to catch the light from every angle and a laugh that chimed like wind chimes in a summer breeze. She told him she loved him, that he was the missing piece she'd been searching for, and Bob, completely swept away, believed every word. He had a good job, a steady income, and a small, but comfortable life. He had everything to lose, and Lila, it turned out, was an expert at making people lose everything.

Her plan unfolded with the quiet grace of a predator stalking its prey. First, she convinced him to quit his job. ""It‚Äôs holding you back, my love,"" she‚Äôd whisper, her fingers tracing circles on his chest. ""We can start our own business, just the two of us. We'll be partners in everything."" Bob, blinded by love, saw no trap. He drained his savings and liquidated his small stock portfolio to fund her ""brilliant"" venture‚Äîa shell company with an impressive name and no actual product.

Next came the money. The business bled funds, and Lila, with practiced ease, convinced Bob to transfer his remaining assets into a joint account. ""It's for our future, darling,"" she cooed, her eyes wide and innocent. ""This way, we can build our empire together."" Bob, no longer questioning her motives, signed the papers without a second thought, giving her full access to every cent he had. The money vanished into accounts he couldn't see, spent on lavish things he never used and transactions he didn't understand.

With his finances in her control, she began to take his life away, piece by piece. She subtly turned him against his friends, calling them jealous and unsupportive. His family visits became less frequent, then stopped altogether. ""They don't understand us,"" she‚Äôd say, and Bob, isolated and alone, leaned on her more and more until she was his entire world. The vibrant, confident man he had been slowly faded, replaced by a hollowed-out shell, his only purpose to fulfill her every whim.

The end came with a chilling swiftness that left him breathless. One morning, he woke to an empty house. His car was gone, his wallet and keys were missing, and the joint account was completely wiped out. There was no note, no explanation, only the deafening silence of a life stolen. He was a ghost in his own home, with nothing left but the echo of her laughter. He tried to call her, but the number was disconnected. He went to the ""office"" of their business, only to find a vacant storefront. The love he thought was so real was nothing more than a carefully constructed lie.

Months later, broken and working a minimum-wage job, Bob saw her in a coffee shop. Her hair was still that blinding blonde, her laugh just as captivating. But she wasn't alone. She was with another man, a poor sod with a hopeful, trusting look in his eyes‚Äîthe same look Bob had once worn. She was whispering sweet words to him, tracing circles on his arm, and Bob knew that the cycle was beginning again.

1ng5lab,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ng5lab,Free job hunt organization tool,"Made this little job hunting tool [https://jobbee.uk/](https://jobbee.uk/) .   
  
I've made a bunch of little tools, some larger ones, using varrying levels of hand-coding, assisted, or full on vibe coded.  This tiny one (a single file) was in the full on vibe coded category.  It turned out surprisingly useful to me, so I made it public.  Should scale just fine to large numbers of users etc.  It's just a single file bundle. No data is collected, everything is on the users machine (a weak point in a way, as it won't look the same across their devices).  Still, it's handy, and the price is right.

My previous most recent effort was a much larger project, and I was glad to get back to something tiny.  Built initially in the chat version of GPT-5 and GPT-5-pro, but when I found that to do quite poorly for minor adjustments and tweaks, I switched to the webui version of codex, which worked like a dream for such a tiny project.

I am getting the silent treatment from you.

I set the alarm in the morning hoping to be your ride to work. The call that never came.

I almost took a picture of my morning coffee to send to you . The mundane , like our routine , but I did not.  Would it vanish into the blackhole of unread messages?

My Whys:

* Why did you respond to me with warmth after seeing my post?
* Why did you unblock me ? Only to not talk.
* Why did you change your profile pic to our shared memory ? And then just  give me polite responses like we are strangers.
* Why leave me on unread for endless hours? Is this tit-for-tat ?

Feels like breadcrumbing, even if you don‚Äôt mean it to be. Keeping the thread alive and not feeding the connection and avoiding.

If you need time, just say it. I am waiting with bated breath for messages that never come.

Release me if you don't want this. Us. Block me, and I‚Äôll grieve. Loudly. But at least I‚Äôll know.

You are not in. You are not out.  I am standing, waiting, unraveling.  Hour by hour.  Minute by Minute.

I don't want to be a friend or a stranger that we check-in on occasionally.

I know I hurt you by deleting and blocking.  I am sorry. And falling on my knees is not beneath me.

Everything felt pointless in the moment after repeated conversations about needs and desires. My third flight trip to you returning home was the same -  crying, starving and unraveling.

My Mom has been sinking deeper and deeper into the far-right conspiracy hole for a decade now. I went so far as to learn everything I could to try and meet her on her level to get her out of it, but it always ends with ""you haven't seen what I've seen."" We've gotten into many debates, sometimes very heated, about this. Probably hundreds of hours dedicated to working on this. I'm the only one in the family who tries to pull her out btw. Real Nazi shit minus the white supremacy. Holocaust denier, anti-vax, Ivermectin cures everything, Jewish Zionist elites are running some holy war against the world to gain control over everything. She has seig heiled during an argument. You know, all the worst things you ever thought the right was believing. What does this have to do with me being trans, you might ask?

Well, I married a Jewish (by ethnicity) woman. Ashkenazi Jewish, which is the elite line, according to her. I was with her for 6.5 years in total, married 2. She ended up being extremely narcissistic and abusive to me (mentally, physically, and sexually) and caused an enormous amount of trauma in my family. That's its own whole story that is way too long to put here. The point is, as you can probably see where this is going, my mom took this as confirmation of her beliefs. She goes into these ""micro vs macro"" arguments about the narcissistic and sometimes sociopathic behavior of Jewish people. I try to get into the science of correlation is not causation and all that. I mean we're fighting aggressively about this because I am not at all ok with all this racist crap she's spewing. You might still be wondering, what does this have to do with being trans? Trust me, we're getting there.

So, I've been dealing with gender dysphoria for as long as I can remember, but I'm from a conservative family (if that wasn't obvious by now) and I had to learn what these confusing feelings were, by myself, not even knowing that trans people existed until my 20s (I'm 38 now). I've had a lot of moments of clarity around this and done a lot of mushrooms and such to find peace within myself about who I am. It's been a grueling battle against suicide trying to solve this. I had this huge core memory moment in like summer of 2017. I was at the height of my life as a cis male, with only this trans issue holding me back. I was trying to suppress it so I stood atop a hill, overlooking a lake and city where I lived and said ""if I ever lose my family, friends, and work, I will transition."" I am not a religious person, but I've always been semi spiritual and believe in manifestation. Especially because a few months after this, I met my ex-wife, who destroyed all my friendships, sabotaged my business, and isolated me from my family. She gave me the opportunity to realize that manifestation of transitioning and I took it. I have very complicated feelings towards my ex because of this. I do not condone what she did. It was horrific, but it did give me the door to be able to transition. I wish I never manifested this outcome to begin with, but I was always so worried about disappointing everyone around me and having everyone stop supporting me.

So fast forwarding to finally leaving my relationship and I just came out to my parents 2 weeks ago after 3 years of transitioning. I'm a vanlifer and stay with them sometimes because they have a mother in law in their big house as well as a big garage to repair and clean my van. Coming out did not go well.

in the first round, my parents said they love me but weren't sure they could ever see me as a woman or call me as such. I came in wearing the outfit you can see in another post in my profile. It's not my most fem look, but I was hoping that would be a bridge look for them to think that maybe I look cool. But the early warnings were there. My mom was asking if I took Ayahuasca before coming out, saying maybe that is why I'm transitioning. And that all these myriad of other examples from my decades of figuring it out weren't valid reasons to say I was trans. You know, normal supportive parent stuff.

A week went by and even though I'm in the same house, they ignore me the entire time and we don't see each other. Usually they invite me for dinner every other day so I noticed the absence of their presence. Turned out my mom was stewing on her conspiracies and biding her time to attack me more aggressively. 

I overheard a conversation they were having about cutting me off (my parents are loaded and even though I make my own money, when they pass, I would get a fortune from them) to protect the grandkids (my sister lives next door with 2 kids). That I'm a narcissist who's gaslighting her into thinking I'm trans as a way to control her. I'm writing a somewhat biographical novel that involves my trans experiences and she said even if it was a best seller she'd never read it because of ""that trans stuff"" and that she didn't want it in her head. I overheard them formulating a plan of attack on me using my sister, so after that I barged in and forced the conversation, letting them know I heard everything.

I recorded this conversation, too. All 2.5 hours of it. My mom went on to tell me what she really thought. That I became my ex-wife and am now a ""learned narcissist"" but have been brainwashed by her into thinking I'm trans in her effort to make me become her. I have PTSD induced major memory loss so it's hard for me to totally remember everything that was said in this particular event because it was so heated. That's why I recorded it. One major thing my mom would do is bring up horrific memories of my abuse that have nothing to do with the topic of me being trans. As a way to prove that my ex has brainwashed me. Like using aggressive verbiage around my sexual abuses. I don't want to be more specific than that. It was basically 2.5 hours of her threatening me, triggering me, and telling me I'm not trans. It wasn't until the end of the conversation that I revealed that I had made an attempt on my life 2 days before the first discussion and that's what made me realize I need to come out. My mom immediately said something along the lines of ""I'm suicidal too. Nobody asks me about how I'm doing!"" It always had to be about her and how my transition affected her.

I've suspected my mom is a narcissist for a while. I still do. Makes me worried I could be, since genetics, but I do my best to be empathetic. Anyway, I just remembered calling her out for her stance being based around her conspiracies. She got sooooo upset by that and made more threats. That really touched a nerve with her and made me think it was true.

We got to a truce by the end, but like the first time, there is no actual truce with my mom. It's been another week and now she's looking at houses to move to another state. I wake up really early and get my coffee before my parents wake up since they have the coffee machine. My mom usually gets up super late, like 11-1 pm. It's 8 am and she's right there and this is the first we've spoken since that fight. I ask her how she's doing and she's all pouty and mopey. I ask her if she wants to talk about it and she says ""I cant talk about anything with you."" Super passive aggressive. I shrug it off, get my coffee and wish her well. But it's just insane to me how I'm the one who is coming out and trying to find support, but she makes it about herself and needs all the support.

I know she still thinks I'm brainwashed and tbh, I'm worried she thinks these Jewish women in my life are agents sent to destroy her. It's this complex web of unhealthy internet addiction, narcissism, self destructive behaviors, and whatever else. But her views have shaped the whole family's views, to a degree. My dad and sister both ""see her points"". Like, I want a relationship with my family but I feel like at this point there is no salvaging this. After that, I want to make sure I set my future up well and I'm worried they are going to cut me out of the will. Fortunately there is already money set aside in a trust, but like we're talking ""fuck off and retire for the rest of my life"" kind of money. How much shit do I have to eat to make this work? Is it worth it at all? I kind of need their house regardless because vanlifing has been really hard as a trans person and sometimes I need a break from the outside world. What would you do in this situation?

I'm working out if I can afford a therapist. Despite having an extremely wealthy family, my income is quite modest (about 50k/yr after taxes). They give it all to my sister, who plays their games.

I'm honestly back to my dark thoughts and my last attempt made me realize I do want to live, but it's hard to justify life when I'm surrounded by so much hate, with literally nowhere to go, despite having a van that can take me anywhere. Even liberal cities aren't as supportive as you'd think. You don't need to worry about me in that way, I'm just trying to paint a picture.

When your trans, you really do get to see the worst of humanity and it's bleak out there. I feel like I've played out all conceivable scenarios to death and then some. I need some alternative takes on what I should do. At the very least, I hope my story makes you feel compelled to treat trans people with kindness. We really are going through *a lot* right now.",1,1757789113.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I bought the Prismo because it looked much better and the internet said it was good. Maybe good enough even to completely eliminate any questing into espresso equipment. I made a shot with a paper filter over the metal one, as the internet said it works just fine‚Äîit does! It made a shot of espresso-like strong coffee that made for a good malk drank, and was pretty decent by itself. 

But then later I made a shot *without* the paper filter just to see the difference, and it tasted like complete ass. Rather than making another shot a couple clicks higher, I ran it back through the AP+Prismo with a paper filter, and it proceeded to taste much less of ass, and left a substantial amount of sediment on the filter.

Tl;dr: A paper filter in the Prismo filtered out 1.2 grams of sediment from a metal-only-filtered shot [Filters are .2g]. A small amount of that would be moisture, but it was pretty dry. 

Moral being, I know that paper filters help coffee be less mean to me, as I'm able to achieve the overdoing-caffeine-chest-seizing-maybe -I'm-going-to-die-after-this-double-light-roast-coffee long before I get the 'The Shakes and It's Itchy-Back-Time' [TSaIIBT] (I try not to though, lol).

1ng5cpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCroommates/comments/1ng5cpr/looking_for_roommates_in_stuyvesant_town_east/,Looking for roommate(s) in Stuyvesant Town East Village - 2 or 3br in late November/early December $2000-2500.,"Hello, I recently posted my room for rent, but it looks like I'll be looking for a new place within the same apartment complex instead! 

I'm looking for a considerate, responsible, and communicative roommate(s) to share a large 2 or 3 bedroom apartment near 15th and 1st Street in Stuyvesant Town. The apartment will be permanently stabilized. I will likely take the master bedroom so I'll be paying more than you.

They always have a variety of apartments available, and as I'm a current tenant in good standing, they're willing to work with me on telling me about new units available. I'll be upfront that I'd prefer a higher floor apartment that faces south. That's really my only preference! My personal ceiling for my part of the rent is about $2600, but the lower the better.

**Me:**

I'm in my 30s and I work in academia 5 days a week in the office. When I have downtime, I'm working out, hanging out with friends outside the apartment, and reading and writing. I'm an ambivert and I'm a big literature and performing arts person. We don't have to become friends but very cool if we do or just go for drinks or watch a film from time to time. I love listening to music and watching films at home (though not loudly!); however, I am not someone who has lots of parties or has tons of people over at once save the very rare occasion. I'm hoping to find someone who is similar.

I'm not a neat freak, but I'd like folks who are good about cleaning up after themselves. I'm happy to have a day or evening where we all spend an hour cleaning, or am happy to split costs on a professional cleaner once a month or so.

**Your Room:**

\- Seeking someone to commit to a one year lease.

\- Non-master bedrooms are approximately 10' x 12"" and often have large closets. 

\- unfurnished except for AC. I could give you my clothing racks if you like, though!

\- Rent: depending on the unit, $2000-2500, which includes water, electricity, gas, AC. Broadband will be split between us. I'm looking to get Fios, maybe Spectrum and don't want to spend more than $100 a month.

**The Apartment:**

**- All ST apartments are huge, especially by East Village standards!**

\- Huge living and dining room - in most units they are about 12' x 20'. I already have a dining table and a couple dining chairs. I plan to buy more. I have an old couch I can bring, but eventually I'll buy a new one unless you have a better one you want to bring. I'm not attached to mine.

\- Kitchen with dishwasher and appliances

\- Bathroom includes a tub.

\- Laundry on the ground floor - it's quite affordable

\- Beautiful views from bedrooms and kitchen

**In addition, Stuyvesant Town has:**

\- 24/7 Security

\- Gym, cafe, library, ice skating rink in winter, extra storage space on the ground floor for an extra fee if you need it

\- Basketball, pickleball courts, playgrounds

\- Lots of green spaces, including a huge lawn

\- L train, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Target, some of the best bars in the city are a 5 minute walk away.

**Next Steps:**

If you're interested, please let me know what you do for work, or if you study, and your income level - their threshold is 36x the rent. I'll do a video call with you first, and then if we vibe, I'd love to meet you over a coffee. You're welcome to bring a dog or cat or any other small animal you have - I love cats and dogs. I prefer finding a woman for the room, but the right kind of guy would do too. I'm not opposed to couples if we're a good match, but the rent would be higher for two people.

**The first time I met him was mixed emotion and I never had imagined that I will have to pay such a heavy price for a cup of coffee.** Who ever imagines that one day they will end up knocking the doors of the government authorities for justice. **What I was envisioning as a love story that will end up in me getting married to the person I love.** I had no clue that this will be the worst nightmare.

**I got scammed by the person who I thought would be my life partner.** He pretended that he's a dream come true and you are engulfed with the illusions of being in a fairy tale until you loose everything in the process. **He not only scammed me financially, he made sure that I have nothing for myself and my survival became a question. He trapped me in debt trap and a narcissistic trap shoving small doses of toxic positivity.** He kept me entangled emotionally and when you lose everything you have no choice. I **have suffered silently for 1.5 years hoping things would change. Pretending to be depression and bankrupt, I was still ready to be by his side and yet he didn't want me.** I could see the bread crumbing clearly but to confront him put me under extreme pressure and I would feel anxious. But sometimes I would logically counter him and then watch him getting real mad on phone. Often threatened into being silent. **He trapped me in a 1 Crore debt trap and than went MIA.** 

**Last year I wanted to end my life as I couldn't understand what did I do to deserve this unkindness from this person. For whom I risked everything**

Took me a lot of courage to come forward and file a case against him. Turns out to be he is a serial scamster who targets women who are financially stable and wants to get married. **He claims to be a businessperson but the only business he has is scam 2-3 women at the same time.** Exploit them physically, financially and then harass them and torture them emotionally. His family is aware of their son's misdoings but they haven't stopped their Raja Beta. **His excuse is that he grew up in South Delhi and had people would show off, so he decided to make easy and completely tax free money.**

He thinks that he can be **Ricky Behl from Ladies Vs Ricky Behl.** He not only ran away with our money, he took away our feeling of safety, sowed seeds of self-doubt and made us hate ourselves for loving and wanting to be loved. God knows I gave everything to this relationship but I am glad that now I know why God removed him. **From sobbing to learning to laugh again, I am finding my way back to life. I always wanted someone like Ranveer Singh but I had never thought that ki Ricky Behl gale pad jaega. (Lol)**

**Mr. Fraud had a longstanding girlfriend who most likely knew about his wrongdoings and yet she lied to us.** He was spending our hard earned money on her and partying around while I didn't even had money for food. **Yet he would shed crocodile tears and say if ""I am a bad person, I will rot in hell and swear on his own dead father and God.""** And now he is rotting in hell.

So, God thought that it's payback time and Karma started to catch up, I decided to take the legal route and submitted all the evidence to prove the crime. **Multiple visits to police station and later on to Courts. And boom then 7 months later, I got a call from an unknown number and She enquired about him and I was like these people are trying new tricks but when we started to talk, we realised the same pattern.** The worst part is the inhumane treatment met to us so that we end the relationship and he gets away with it without being the bad person.

**There are 3 girls that I am aware of that this person has scammed for over INR 1 Crore.** He might have taken away my money and from my money he is paying off the fancy lawyers. **But he forgot that he once said that ""Bhagwan ka tumpar haath hai"" and as long as my fight is about justice, I won't lose.** 

I might have lost my money and a little bit of jag hasayi and this girl away from home, is far more resilient and hardworking. I will build myself again but I won't let this monster out. And this is my story in progress. If you pray please keep me in your prayers and legally I am doing everything to get him punished.

**P.S. This picture is from the Starbucks at High Court and this time I might be trembling because of the trauma but my truth is unshakeable. I am not here to seek your sympathy but to share my story of fighting back and standing tall.**

I have stopped eating all kinds of shit I used to eat previously. I stopped eating snacks, chips, fast food and I also dropped drinking sodas and teas. I am currently only drinking water, and have been doing so for almost 2 months now.

I have stopped eating too much, like I used to eat 2 plates of homecooked meals, but now I just eat 1 plate.  I also have stopped eating little snacks during the day, if I am hungry, I just do not eat anything extra, cause those little snacks over the day add up pretty quickly.

I have wondered how quickly should I start to see some progress from this ""eat less than your body consumes"" and from not drinking any sugar drinks anymore, just sprinkling water. Only thing I have noticed is that my face is now less buffy, and I have gotten a little slimmer face, probably just from not eating salty and greasy foods, and from not drinking sugar drinks anymore.

  
My daily diet is somewhat like this:

wake up: drink coffee and eat 1 or 2 bread with a little bit of butter and a few slices of cheese on top 

daily meal at around 4 pm: usually just some homecooked stuff like mashed potatoes and chicken or other meat, no excess oil or grease is used while making the food and if there is some grease left from say groundbeef, I always pour them out from the pan before eating.

evening: another cup of coffee and a bread or two.

then around 1.5 - 2 litres of water per day.

The kind that‚Äôs almost too good to be true. It‚Äôs not with us, the version that exists somewhere inside us. Our souls crave each other, but so does the pain, the broken part of us. 

When I was younger words bled from my fingers onto a screen. Strangers read my words, my stories of love at an age I should‚Äôve been playing with other children. But I wasn‚Äôt a child, not the way I felt things, not the way I could transmute pain into something else. Though as I did that I was also disciplined, made to be the problem, I wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúkid‚Äù and that bothered my mother. It‚Äôs hard to come to terms that I blame myself for things I shouldn‚Äôt, I hold onto weight that‚Äôs not mine to carry. I have a lot of shame for things where I shouldn‚Äôt have any. Old belief systems that were forced upon me before I could even breathe by someone that should‚Äôve protected me, never once did she - never once has she needed to. 

The love I dreamt of was ancient, it was longing, it was remembering disguised as a hopeless romantic for someone I wished for. My soul knew of my love before I did. And that‚Äôs deep and true and actually terrifying. It was only fantasy when I was younger, never once did I actually believe I‚Äôd find that love my soul screamed for. I spent a long time suppressing a lot. 

I don‚Äôt know how to get close to people really, I don‚Äôt know how to be seen by you. 

But I‚Äôd like to surprise you with flowers and I don‚Äôt even know if you like flowers, but it‚Äôs the thought, a form of care. I‚Äôd cut the stems, rearrange them nicely in a vase. I‚Äôd hope they make you smile just for a moment. 

I‚Äôd like to wake you up with breakfast. I‚Äôd learn and remember how you like your coffee, your eggs, your bacon, your toast. I‚Äôd clean up as I cook so neither one have to worry about it after. 

I‚Äôd like to run a warm bath for you after a long day of work. I‚Äôd sit there with you as you vent about the day you had. I‚Äôd listen, I‚Äôd smile as I watch the way your mouth moves and the way your voice changes depending what you‚Äôre talking about. Then I‚Äôd lit a candle and leave - giving you space to breathe, to fall into the bath to think, to feel, to relax. 

I want you sitting on top of me as music plays in the background, carefree and fully present. I‚Äôd admire you. I‚Äôd lean in to embrace you. A certain song would come on and desire would creeped in before I even noticed, I‚Äôd push your hips down and push mine forward slightly just to feel you a little closer. 

No one has cracked me open like you. You are my driving force. I‚Äôm still learning. You‚Äôre still learning. I have to start showing up for myself better that way we can show up for each other one day even if it‚Äôs my dreams. 

No pressure, we got the rest of our lives. 

I‚Äôm truly sorry for calling you names instead of asking you more questions. I should‚Äôve broken down your defenses not added more bricks. I don‚Äôt know what you have been going through, but I do know your energy has been incredibly heavy. I‚Äôve been acting like poor me this whole time, not knowing what you were dealing with. I wasn‚Äôt able to separate the energy, it felt like mine. I‚Äôm sorry. I was fighting fire with fire because I couldn‚Äôt tell what was real and what wasn‚Äôt.  

No more of that. I want peace. I want you to feel peace. I hope things are better now.

I just celebrated my birthday recently at a resort with my dog, and it was honestly one of the happiest days I‚Äôve had in a while. As much as I loved it, a small part of me wished that next time I‚Äôm there, I could share the experience with a partner and my dog by my side.

# üì± The Coffee Shop That Changed My Mind

So I'm at this little coffee shop I've been going to for like 2 years. Same owner, Maria, always behind the counter doing everything manually - taking orders on paper, calculating totals with a calculator (I'm not kidding), manually texting her supplier when she's low on beans.

Classic small business owner who'd probably laugh if you mentioned ""automation.""

Yesterday I walk in and she's got an iPad at the counter, automated inventory alerts pinging her phone, and she's showing me how her new system automatically orders supplies when she hits certain thresholds.

**Me:** ""What happened? You used to hate all this tech stuff.""

**Maria:** ""COVID broke me. I realized I can't run a business by working 16-hour days forever. My daughter taught me this stuff actually makes life easier, not harder.""

That conversation hit me like a truck.

# ü§î The Shift I'm Seeing Everywhere

It's not just Maria. In the past 6 months, I've had more small business owners reach out about automation than in my previous 2 years combined.

**What changed?**

**1. They finally hit their breaking point** COVID forced everyone to work smarter, not harder. Business owners who survived did it by eliminating manual processes, not by working more hours.

**2. Their kids/employees are pushing them** Gen Z employees are straight-up refusing to do repetitive manual tasks. They're like ""why are we manually entering this data when it could be automated?"" And honestly? They're right.

**3. The tools got stupid simple** Remember when ""automation"" meant hiring developers for months? Now it's ""click this, connect that, done."" Even my most tech-phobic clients can understand basic workflow builders.

**4. Everyone's talking about it** Their competitors are automating. Their suppliers are offering API integrations. Their customers expect faster responses. FOMO is real.

# üí° The Patterns I'm Seeing

**What they're asking for now vs. 2 years ago:**

**2022:** ""Can you build me a website?"" **2024:** ""Can you automate my entire customer journey from lead to payment?""

**2022:** ""I need someone to manage my social media""  
**2024:** ""I want automated posting, review monitoring, and customer service chatbots""

**2022:** ""Help me organize my spreadsheets"" **2024:** ""Connect my sales data to inventory, accounting, and marketing automatically""

The requests went from ""fix this one thing"" to ""optimize my entire operation.""

# üöÄ What This Means for Us

**The opportunity is massive, but different than I expected:**

**They don't want complex systems anymore.** They want simple, reliable automations that solve one clear problem really well. The ""bells and whistles"" approach is dead.

**They're willing to pay for peace of mind.** I'm charging 2x more than last year because they understand that automation = getting their life back.

**They want partners, not vendors.** These aren't one-off projects anymore. They want someone who understands their business and can suggest improvements over time.

**The market expanded by like 10x.** Every small business is now a potential automation client. Restaurant, plumber, lawyer, yoga studio - doesn't matter.

# üéØ The Mistake I Almost Made

I was so focused on building complex, impressive workflows that I almost missed this wave.

**Reality check:** Maria doesn't care that I can integrate 47 different APIs. She cares that she can sleep in on Sunday mornings now because her inventory orders itself.

**The simple stuff is where the money is:**

* Email automation sequences
* Review monitoring and alerts
* Appointment booking and reminders
* Inventory alerts and reordering
* Social media content scheduling
* Basic customer data syncing

**These ""boring"" automations pay $200-500/month per client.** And there are millions of small businesses that need them.

# üòÖ My Honest Take

I'll be real with you - I feel like I stumbled into this realization by accident.

For months I was trying to impress potential clients with advanced AI integrations and complex multi-step workflows. Meanwhile, Maria just wanted to stop manually counting coffee beans every morning.

**The breakthrough:** Start with their biggest daily annoyance, not your most impressive technical skill.

**What's working for me now:**

1. **Discovery calls focused on pain points,** not capabilities
2. **Simple solutions first,** complexity later if needed
3. **Monthly retainers** instead of one-time projects
4. **Teaching them to fish** rather than just building systems

# ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Questions I'm Still Working Through

* How do we scale this without losing the personal touch they want?
* What happens when every small business has basic automation? What's next?
* Are we creating dependency or actually empowering them?
* How do we stay ahead when the tools keep getting simpler?

# üí≠ Your Experience?

Anyone else noticing this shift? Are small business owners in your area suddenly interested in automation?

**Curious about:**

* What types of requests are you getting now vs. a year ago?
* Are you seeing similar willingness to pay for ""simple"" solutions?
* How are you positioning yourself as automation becomes mainstream?
* What industries are you seeing the biggest demand from?

**Bottom line:** The small business automation gold rush is happening right now. But it's not about building the most sophisticated system - it's about solving real problems for people who just want their businesses to run smoother.

Maria's coffee shop taught me that sometimes the best automation is the one that lets you sleep in on Sunday.

*Who knew a conversation about coffee inventory would change how I think about my entire business?* ‚òï

*What's the simplest automation that's had the biggest impact on a client's life? I'm collecting stories about these ""boring but life-changing"" workflows...*",2,1757788603.0,n8n_ai_agents,0,1.0,False
1ng55td,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1ng55td/does_this_sound_like_sibo/,Does this sound like SIBO?,"Please note: it's too late to get tested because all my symptoms are gone and its almost like I don't have ibs anymore (just in remission for now, I know how it goes lol)

So I'm just curious what people think. Late last year and earlier this year I was getting wild symptoms even worse than normal. Basically, I would eat some foods that maybe would trigger me a bit. The next day, I would have to go for a bowel movement after eating some more food. The bowel movement itself would suddenly give me cramps, make me super nauseous, and I would not feel better until throwing up everything I just ate. This kept happening and at one point I was so sick I went to the ER and they could not determine the issue either. I was prescribed some PPI's, and after awhile the problem died down a hit but it still happened infrequently

Cut to dental surgery, and I get put on antibiotics. I was not looking forward to them as I've had ibs-D most of my life and know how that goes. While I was on them I had diarrhea constantly but nothing painful

Once off them, I also happened to cut out tea and all caffiene, as tea and coffee are acidic and I decided it would be best to try that to relieve symptoms

Well now a few months later, I barely have any symptoms of even my normal ibs. Normal bowel movements most of the time, no pain, no vomiting (thank fuck), and when I take an iron pill it now takes 2 full days to tell that I have taken one, whereas I used to pass it in less than 24 hours

Could it have been SIBO? I'm very curious if anyone else had these symptoms. At the time I had no idea what this could be but now after all is said and done, I'm questioning it more

Thoughts? I'm just gathering information so if it happens again, I can ask my doctor for a proper SIBO test or whatever it may have been

Also note: I am waiting on appointments for a gastro and a gyno, but these take forever in Canada and I can not rush the appointments",1,1757788578.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

To be clear, there‚Äôs nothing more than friendship. Recently, I was disappointed by some of her words and actions. She thinks that because I‚Äôm a man, I should always pay when we hang out. From my point of view, it‚Äôs not about the money but about courtesy.

When I meet my male friends in a caf√© or elsewhere, it‚Äôs very rare that each one of us pays only for what he ordered. It‚Äôs always the same when it‚Äôs time to leave: *‚ÄúLa rta7 hadchi 3la 7sabi‚Äù* or the waiter tells you *‚Äúla safi rah khaless flan‚Äù*. Then next time you ‚Äúbeat them‚Äù and pay yourself for the rest.

But here, it seems I‚Äôm expected to pay automatically‚Äîjust because I‚Äôm a man?

Another thing happened recently. I was without a car, and we were talking about going out, but she refused to pick me up. She laughed, saying, *‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this princess treatment? You should just take a taxi.‚Äù* I don‚Äôt live in Rabat or anywhere in useful Morocco. I told her, ‚ÄúFor real, you want me to walk ten minutes through a poorly lit neighborhood that looks like a mine field in the night just to reach the main avenue, then wait for a taxi if they got still a place(most likely a white one), spend an hour and a half in the city, and then come back home the same way? Can‚Äôt you just pick me up, like I would do for you, and save us both the time and hassle?‚Äù

Do women think men are just meant for *tkarfis*? Don‚Äôt you care if your male friends get home safe?

For example, when I needed a ride to a neighboring city, I asked a friend around 9 a.m. I found him half-asleep, having his morning coffee, and he said, *‚ÄúI‚Äôll pick you up at your place in 15 minutes.‚Äù* He drove me, refused to let me pay for gas, and told me, *‚ÄúHadchi 3lach kaynin s7ab.‚Äù* I‚Äôve done the same for my friends when they needed a ride‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs normal.

I studied abroad and had women friends (both Moroccans and Westerners), and I don‚Äôt remember any of them expecting me to pay just because I was a man. It was normal to either split or share the costs (I‚Äôd pay for the cinema tickets and she‚Äôd get the popcorn). They also took the initiative‚Äîstarting conversations, suggesting activities, etc. And when it made more sense to take their cars, they offered rides without hesitation.

As I said, I had Moroccan female friends abroad who were born and raised in Morocco, and we genuinely cared about each other. But I lived abroad for a long time, and I didn‚Äôt hang out with girls when I was in high school here. Also, I'm not going to stretch on the replies hours after the message is received.

It‚Äôs only the beginning and I am already seeing Muslims follow this trend to get people to go to their newly opened coffee shops, chicken shops, or what ever product of service they sell.

I cannot exaggerate how dangerous this new practice is because when legit and proper advice or knowledge is posted it gets completely ignored on social media. 

What do y‚Äôall think is the solution to get people to click on something without bait? 

I kind of found some way to do this without baiting in a way that is very borderline impermissible. I think using really bright colors, beautiful pictures of landscapes or some aesthetically pleasing pictures.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Fenerbah√ße vs. Trabzonspor: A Clash of Titans (or a Football Version of ""Rock, Paper, Scissors"")**

The Turkish Super Lig‚Äôs most anticipated rivalry‚ÄîFenerbah√ße vs. Trabzonspor‚Äîhas been rescheduled to 7 PM to avoid clashing with the nation‚Äôs more *elevated* sporting pursuit: basketball. The Turkish Football Federation‚Äôs priorities are as clear as a ref‚Äôs whistling: *‚ÄúBasketball jumps, football waits.‚Äù* But let‚Äôs not let the time change distract us from the main event. This is a match where history, odds, and hubris collide.

### Parsing the Odds: Fenerbah√ße‚Äôs Implied Invincibility

The bookmakers have spoken, and they‚Äôve done so with the enthusiasm of a tax auditor reviewing your receipts. Fenerbah√ße is the overwhelming favorite, with implied win probabilities hovering around **70%** (decimal odds \~1.42-1.44). Trabzonspor? A meager **14-15%**, which is about the same chance of me correctly predicting the outcome of a coin flip while blindfolded and juggling. The draw? A paltry **20-22%**, which is statistically less likely than my Wi-Fi deciding to work on the first try.

These numbers aren‚Äôt just numbers‚Äîthey‚Äôre a *declaration*. Fenerbah√ße‚Äôs dominance in this fixture is as inevitable as a Netflix auto-play ad. Trabzonspor‚Äôs last victory? November 2023. That‚Äôs a 680-day drought longer than a Turkish coffee‚Äôs brewing time. In their last nine meetings, Trabzonspor has managed *one draw* and eight losses. Their star striker, Paul Onuachu, carries the weight of a small nation on his shoulders‚Äîpressure so thick you could slice it with a *simit* (Turkish bread).

### News Digest: Basketball Gets the Spotlight, Trabzonspor Gets the Side-eye

The TFF‚Äôs decision to move kickoff times to prioritize the EuroBasket final is as controversial as a referee awarding a last-minute penalty. While football fans will have to watch without the distraction of post-game basketball glory, Trabzonspor‚Äôs players might be grateful‚Äîthey‚Äôll avoid the embarrassment of playing whi

I was told the whole story by someone who used to be close to my mother and then I made my own research with other people that were present at the time. My father was a Russian immigrant here. He came with his siblings and their mother. No father. My mother is wealthy and he used to work for her family. Its a common practice in this neighbourhood even now - to have teenagers who work during the summer in people's yards - cleaning the pool, taking care of the garden and so on. That was what my dad was doing. His English was broken, elementary, I was told and he was working in my mother's yard. He and some of his siblings, I believe 2 sisters.

I was born a few days before he turned 18 and when he turned 18 he got married to my mother and she was very abusive. Controlling, possessive, made him limit and then cut contact with his family. He stayed married to her for 5 or 6 years. She caught him cheating with the woman his age that was babysitting me.

I reached out at 15 and he hesitantly agreed to meet but I had to take an adult with me and it was my mother. I only had my mother, grandma and my mother's boyfriend at the time. I talked with mother's brother but he said he doesn't want to see that "" spoiled Russian brat"" of my father again

 She didn't get inside the coffee shop with me but looked at the interraction from the street and he kept looking at her. Wasn't comfortable at all. I look just like him. Blue eyes, light brown hair, thin and and tall. I couldn't believe how similar we are. He is married to someone. I was 15. I knew he has his reasons to avoid Mom but I felt so rejected. I brought him something I painted and wanted to get to know him while he was cold and distant and he made me feel like trash. We met again because I wanted it and he was warmer this time and asked me questions about me but didn't really want to tell me anything about his life.

In the end, even at 15, I felt he doesn't want me and I felt rejected so I wrote him a text on IG that I don't want to be a burden for him nor do I want him to keep in contact when he clearly doesn't want me. My text was so long and his reply was: You don't understand but I can't do this.

Now I am 19 and he reached out. Why? Should I give him a chance? he hurt me so much at 15. I was just a kid. Just wanted to know my Dad.

Mother told me he cheated on her a lot and once hit her head against the table. I asked him about this and he admitted he did it. Because she didn't tell him and make sure he doesn't know that his mother died. And also that ex friend of her told me that Dad once was drunk and angry and crying and he ra...ped my Mom. For now everything that woman told me was confirmed. So what to do?

I‚Äôve mentioned Larry before. However, Beth was no picnic either. Both Larry and Beth fought tooth and nail, and I overheard a lot of their nonsense. 

Beth came in to work on a different team and was placed in our section of the office for some reason. That was red flag number one. At first she seemed fine, but we quickly learned that she had a short fuse and a foul mouth. Larry was her nemesis with his loud and annoying habits. 

Larry always had junk food and snacks; bags of chips, Timbits, breakfast burritos, jumbo iced coffees. He ate and drank constantly (and loudly). One day, he crinkled his bag of chips and started munching. Beth shouted over her cube for him to shut up. Oh no, this is not going to end well‚Ä¶

With Larry‚Äôs junk food addiction, he obviously  had stomach problems and frequent flatulence. One day he ripped a gnarly fart, and the whole hallway heard Beth groan and curse at him. ‚ÄúAww s**t what‚Äôs wrong with you?!‚Äù Finally someone calling Larry out on his nasty habits lol! The next day, Beth brought in an air freshener to perch on the wall between her and Larry‚Äôs cubes. Great, now the office smells like a delicate mix of Hawaiian breeze and sour fart cloud, yuck!

Beth always complained and was as rude and obnoxious as Larry. One day there was an altercation which culminated with Larry flipping Beth off. I don‚Äôt know the whole story, but it involved Larry‚Äôs birthday cake, which Beth said tasted like battery acid. Beth taped up an Ed, Edd, n Eddy cartoon character labeled ‚ÄúLarry‚Äù in his cube. She taped up a picture of Ms. Piggy in another girl‚Äôs cube. The whole office quickly began to hate her. Larry just added fuel to her fire. My cube location was like being in Poland in 1939. It stressed me out so much. 

The s**t hit the fan when we found out Beth was saving files on her PC that her team needed. She had a bad habit of hoarding important data and refusing to share the locations on the local drives. One of her teammates approached her about this, and she went nuclear. She cussed out a colleague who I liked and called her fat (the pot calling the kettle black). Larry butted in and chewed Beth out. I walked away and discovered the next day that delusional, psychotic Beth got canned.

It promised optimal brewing temperatures, reusable filters, and an easy-to-use design, which piqued my interest. Here's my take on how it performs in real-world use.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my eye was its sleek stainless steel and black finish. It has a modern aesthetic that blends effortlessly into most kitchen setups. At around 8 inches deep and a little shy of 15 inches tall, it isn‚Äôt compact, but its design uses space efficiently. I personally appreciated the robust build. Despite its 9-pound weight, the coffee maker feels sturdy and well-made, reminding me of reliability you‚Äôd expect from restaurant-grade equipment. The removable water tank also makes it convenient to refill, and trust me, not spilling water all over the counter is a small victory I value.

**Ease of Use and Special Features**  
As someone who isn‚Äôt best coordinated early in the morning, I can say this coffee machine is very straightforward to use. The buttons on the interface are intuitive, and programming the timer was hassle-free. Knowing that it brews coffee at an optimal 200¬∞F ensures the flavors are extracted perfectly. For hurried mornings, the time-saving mode was a lifesaver by cutting down brewing time while keeping the coffee hot and flavorful. The permanent stainless mesh filter is a big win in my book; there's no need to shuffle through paper filters before the caffeine has even kicked in. I simply wash and reuse it, cutting down on waste (and costs).

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
This machine delivers where it truly matters ‚Äì taste. Once brewed, the coffee is rich, aromatic, and stays steaming hot in the vacuum-insulated carafe for hours. My family likes their coffee piping hot, and this feature kept everyone happy during weekend brunches. The thumb-activated pouring design is smooth and avoids messy drips, which I‚Äôve experienced with other coffee carafes before. Notably, for those into iced coffee, there‚Äôs a specific ratio adjustment designed to prevent your brew from tasting watered down after it hits the ice ‚Äì a thoughtful touch. My attempts at iced coffee were consistently flavorful, impressing even my most coffee-snobby friends. 

**Advantages**  
- Brews at an optimal, high temperature (200¬∞F) for ideal flavor extraction.  
- High-quality vacuum-insulated carafe keeps coffee hot for hours.  
- Permanent, washable filter reduces waste and hassle.  
- Removable water tank makes refills and cleaning convenient.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- While the stainless steel design looks premium, the machine could be a bit large for small kitchens.  
- For first-time users, the programming and setup instructions might require a bit of patience.  
- The brewing isn't exactly quiet; the sound is noticeable but not annoying.  

**Competing Brands**  
In the market, this coffee maker faces off against machines like the Technivorm Moccamaster and the Cuisinart Coffee Center. While the Technivorm rivals Zojirushi in terms of coffee quality and elevated brewing temperatures, it lacks the versatility of the iced coffee feature and is often far pricier. On the other hand, Cuisinart brings more features (like dual coffee and single-serve options) but doesn‚Äôt quite match Zojirushi‚Äôs long-lasting thermal carafe or sturdy design. 

The reusable filter and removable tank also give this product an edge over competitors that stick to proprietary filter designs or fixed water reservoirs, which can be limiting. 

**Bang for the Buck**  
Priced moderately within this category, the coffee maker gives excellent value considering its durability, precision brewing, and reusable components. Investing in something that consistently delivers strong, hot, and flavorful coffee feels justified. Given the thought that‚Äôs gone into designing it for hot and iced coffee aficionados alike, it certainly offers features that stretch the price-to-quality ratio in your favor.

One that would be good black but also good with milk. I started at 200¬∞ and turn it up to 207. What I do is turn the nob fully on for 2 seconds then quickly back down the the desired temp, this time 207. I do this to have it heat up faster. You could always use a lower starting temp and a higher end temp. This is comparable to an auto drip but better quality.

Biggest mistake of my life. I think I was presented with so many false promises, but at the end of the day, the only person to blame is myself for not researching enough. Ultimately I chose RAI because I was told I‚Äôd only have to wait 6 months for my levels to even out and then I can try to conceive. And now here I am, nearly 6 months after treatment, and I absolutely hate myself, hate the way I look, hate what I‚Äôve been through. I can‚Äôt even bear the thought of bringing a baby into this world knowing I can pass this on to him or her. It wouldn‚Äôt be fair. 

I wish I was still battling my graves symptoms. Because at least then I felt beautiful. I was thinner. I had more hair. My face was slim. My clothes fit right. My eyes were smaller and even. I was confident. Sure, I had the shakes and heart palpitations and couldn‚Äôt have coffee - but at least I felt alive. 

Now, I feel dead inside.  I‚Äôm bloated all the time. My face is puffy, swollen and round. The scale won‚Äôt budge no matter how clean I eat or how much movement I get. I‚Äôm losing clumps of hair daily. Oh gosh and my eyes‚Ä¶. My right eye is noticeably bigger than my left, and my eye bags have doubled in size. My CT scan and ophthalmologist swear I don‚Äôt have TED  but I beg to differ. 

I‚Äôm on my second dosage adjustment of levothyroxine, and I‚Äôm no where near seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. (T4 is normal, TSH is below normal. I was on 50mcg, now I‚Äôm on 25mcg.) I mourn the woman I was just last year. I look at old photos of me everyday, and compared to the woman I am today- they are two completely different people. 

So is this it? Did I officially glow DOWN? Should I just accept that this is my new norm, and that I‚Äôll never look like my old self?",5,1757787172.0,gravesdisease,18,0.86,False

I think I only write this to process my own feelings on my situation, provide some entertainment for some, and maybe get a new perspective. I‚Äôm in China and took on some private tutoring on the side. A client is a single mom around my age and has a 5 year old daughter, she wants a native speaker to just come and hang out and interact with the daughter, she‚Äôs quite smart and has a great level of English already. We go have dinner and then walk around a shopping mall or go to a coffee shop and just chat. I dont know the situation exactly but the dad is not around. The mom has said she picked a male teacher to help balance all the female influences in her daughter‚Äôs life. At first i made jokes with my friends that I just feel like a step dad. But as we did more lessons and the student made comments comparing me to her dad (‚Äúyou‚Äôre taller than my dad/ my dad has more arm hair than you‚Äù)  and the activities we are doing are typical family activities, meals, hanging out, reading books together etc, I‚Äôm fairly certain the child is unconsciously putting me in a father role. 

It finally come out when we were walking to the restaurant and the student was walking between us holding her mom‚Äôs hands and reached up to hold my hand as well.  I pulled away and said it‚Äôs not appropriate because I‚Äôm her teacher. She didn‚Äôt respond. But later the mom messaged me saying her daughter was upset about it. I expressed my concerns to the mother about this and she said that I have it all wrong. She always held hands with her previous (female) teachers. If it wasn‚Äôt for the comments comparing me to her father in suitable ways I would maybe agree with her. People don‚Äôt think I can speak Chinese and will ask in front of everyone if I‚Äôm the child‚Äôs father, which is weird because she‚Äôs clearly Chinese and I‚Äôm white. The mother‚Äôs dismissal of this was alarming to me, like the concept of a five-year-old, unconsciously seeing the older man with their mom doing family type things  together as some sort of a father figure and getting attached in an unhealthy way, was unheard of. I have zero interested in anything more than rocking up and collecting my easy money and leaving. The fact that she didn‚Äôt say anything when I pulled my hand away and said something to her mother later about it is more proof that her tiny brain is having trouble navigating this confusing situation for her. I‚Äôm doubting if I  am seeing this situation clearly, or if I‚Äôm projecting in someway, but I fear I could be psychologically damaging her with my unwillingness to meet these unconscious expectations.
