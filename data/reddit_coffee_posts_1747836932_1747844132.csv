As I approached the counter, the barista, who I may or may not have been casually flirting with over the past few weeks, greeted me with a playful grin.

Barista: ""Back for more? I think our cappuccinos might be the highlight of your week.""

Me: ""Oh absolutely, but let's be honest, it's probably just your skillful espresso shots that keep me coming back.""

He chuckled, and there was a twinkle in his eye.

Barista: ""Well, I always try my best... just for you."" 

Me: ""And that's why I'll be naming my first book 'The Caffeine Chronicles: Fueled by Flirty Baristas'."" 

We both laughed, and he threw in an extra shot 'on the house'. Not gonna lie, this casual little banter kinda made my day. ‚òïÔ∏èüí´",1,1747844095.0,softflirts,0,1.0,False

1ks1syb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ks1syb,Climate Cafe South Brooklyn created through the Marine Park Young Adults Association,"We‚Äôre excited to introduce Climate Cafe South Brooklyn, a new community initiative run through the Marine Park Young Adults Association!

The Marine Park Young Adults Association is a community-driven social group for young adults ages 18‚Äì35 in southern Brooklyn that has registered as a nonprofit with the State and will soon be filing as a 501(c)(7) non-charitable nonprofit. Our mission is to create spaces where young people can make meaningful connections through fun events, creative activities, and impactful community service projects. From movie nights and murder mystery parties to concerts and volunteer work, we‚Äôre all about bringing people together and giving back.

Climate Cafe South Brooklyn builds on that mission‚Äîoffering a relaxed, welcoming space for everyone, regardless of age, to come together and talk about climate change in a supportive, non-judgmental environment. It‚Äôs not a lecture or a seminar‚Äîit‚Äôs a conversation. Whether you‚Äôre feeling anxious, inspired, confused, or just curious, you‚Äôre welcome.

Our first Climate Cafe is happening Saturday, June 7th at Marine Park Coffee at 1 PM. Come join us, grab a drink, and take part in a community that cares deeply about people and the planet.

Feel free to connect with us on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/climatecafesouthbrooklyn!

Please let us know if you would like to be a speaker for a future Climate Cafe as we need scientists, climate informed therapists, and other professionals to speak on the climate crisis, and please let us know if you have any ideas for places we could have Climate Cafes in the future as we would like to start meeting in other neighborhoods in southern and central Brooklyn!",1,1747843943.0,Bensonhurst,0,1.0,False
1ks1su9,https://i.redd.it/ewqkt78dt52f1.jpeg,First Extended Fast! (Feeling great so far),"
I am over halfway through my first fast over 36 hours. I did ADF for 2 weeks and didn‚Äôt feel hungry, had no headaches, and honestly wanted to see if I could push myself so I decided that once the timer hit 36 hours I would update the timer to say 48, and I just kept updating it so my new goal is a 5 day fast ending Friday evening just before 6pm!

I have been a long time lurker in this sub trying to gain motivation so i‚Äôll provide all my info below!

My starting weight when I started tracking my food and doing Intermittent Fasting was 228.9lbs and that was March 3rd. My starting weight when I started the 5 day fast was 220lbs.

Female, 21, SW: 220lbs, CW: 216.8lbs GW: 180lbs. I have been drinking water, taking electrolytes, black coffee, and 2 hair, skin, and nail vitamins a day (they have Collagen and Biotin). My purpose for this fast was to break my plateau i‚Äôve hit at 220, and to test to see if I can really do this!

I have had no issues with hunger, headaches, pain, and I was able to do a workout yesterday that involved Core, Cable Machine, and 30min on the Elliptical. I know most say that days 2-3 are the hardest and I guess i‚Äôm just waiting for the other shoe to drop and for this to get really hard later tonight. But I have an extremely positive mindset and I think that‚Äôs what is keeping this easy for me! I‚Äôll continue to update on my progress!",1,1747843936.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

Having been in survival mode for so long across thousands of miles of desert wilderness, I was mostly just glad for access to water. The restorative penumbra of blues and greens I hadn‚Äôt seen since the Peruvian Andes. Radiant shades of sapphire in all directions, with the lightest throws of snow atop the mountains. Clear rivers packed with so much glassy ice that they rang with a metallic chime when I dipped my bottles in for a fill.

Through Junin and San Martin, then Villa La Angostura and Nahuel Huapi. I serviced the bike‚Äôs drivetrain in Bariloche and followed the Old Patagonian Beer Trail west, a busy lakeside drive lined with a dozen or more small breweries and taprooms.

I was looking for a small harbor to begin the Cruce Andino, part of Che Guevara‚Äôs epic Andean traverse that connects three compact ferry hops with a wild backroad marathon between Chile and Argentina. Biking between bars until sunset, I guerrilla camped behind an old church while waiting for the first stage of boat crossings.

I‚Äôd been alone for so long that simply to be in the presence of people again felt preternatural.

* The boiler look like new inside. 
* Shots it pulls are weak, no cremea. 

Is it worth putting in a new pump $35 and replacing the sensors ? Should I just toss (recycle it :)) and **start with something a bit better - if so what do you suggest**?

 Is there a kit of something? I see the video on whole latte love to upgrade the pump - looks easy.  I got the seals from Amazon.

- Siemens EQ6 Plus 700

My old Saeco Minuto was a breeze in maintenance, every couple days we washed and rinsed the milk container.
Cleaning this milk container is mainly the reason for having these both on the short list. Lattego because of the easy of cleaning.
And the Siemens for just having a tube which can go in the milk carton.

I have no experience with either these way, really would like the experience from this community on the milk options, cleaning and the appliances of course.

My preferred water container is a slightly curved canteen that rides on my hip. My preferred stove is a solid fuel esbit stove or (where solid fuel isn't an option) one of those little stoves that sits on top of a fuel can. Preferred eating utensile is the light my fire spork with a spook on one side and fork on the other. 90% of the time I just need to boil water and have something to eat out of. I currently have the following pot options:

- kidney shaped pot that nests with my canteen: easy to retrieve and store, always on my hip so I can use it without unpacking my bag, a lot of times easier to eat out of than the narrower round pots. Problem is it is very tippy, I've lost my coffee and oatmeal a few times now.

- Tall narrow pots (different heights, same base size): I originally got these to to nest with my water bottle, ended up with a few different sizes before I found the one I liked. They're more stable than the kidney shape, but the one I like requires a long spoon instead of my prefered spork option and doesn't nest with any of my other gear anymore. The taller one (the size that works best for me) is also very tippy on the canister stove.

- Shorter wide pots: I use these when I'm with a group doing meals together. They're stable, but way too big for a single serving, and they tend to scorch where the fire hits and leave things cold on the edges. Uses a lot more fuel than the smaller pots, and they are difficult to pack so using them for a quick cup of coffee isn't possible.

Basically, I sort of like all of them for different reasons, but don't love any of them. I want something stable, that packs easy, and is comfortable to use. I know other people manage it, what am I missing here?",1,1747843510.0,CampingandHiking,0,1.0,False

1ks1h6w,https://i.redd.it/0dh508g6r52f1.jpeg,Volume 8 - Chapter 3 - Detailed Summary,"A week has passed, Both Tiara and Sakurai are focused on preparations for the student council‚Äôs final job - the sports festival. On Sunday, Anna, Komari and Kazu take a train and subway to a large athletic stadium in Nagoya. They are there to watch Lemon compete to qualify for Nationals. Lemon has already passed this morning 1500m prelims with the fastest time. A top 6 finish in the finals would qualify her for Nationals. Koto and Tamaki also show up to cheer on Lemon. Riko suddenly appears and greets the two seniors, going so far to hold Tamaki‚Äôs hand which causes him to break into a grin. Koto steps in between the two, but before Koto can say anything about what just happened, Riko compliments her for being as beautiful as the rumours say. Koto stands there completely frozen. The 1500m finals begins, Kazu reminisces on the time Lemon tells him that she‚Äôs going to win Nationals(in the nurses office in Vol 6). Lemon wins with a ten second gap to the runner up. Komari gets overwhelmed with excitement and almost hugs Kazu but instead hugs Anna. Riko spreads her arms wide open, but Koto drags her away(In Kazu‚Äôs mind he believes that‚Äôs how she dealt with everyone after Tamaki). Kazu also sees Mitsuki crying and dabbing his eyes with a handkerchief in front of Chihaya. With this victory, Lemon secures a place at Nationals. 


The next day, Kazu sees Sakurai‚Äôs election poster in the hallway and realizes that there wasn‚Äôt any Tiara posters there. Suddenly he receives a text from Tiara to meet her at the usual place(the courtyard). During the meetup, Tiara appears cosplaying as Chikapyon(the season 2 version of Kazu‚Äôs favourite character from one of his favourite anime). Tiara is extremely embarrassed while Kazu stands there completely speechless. Tiara then ask ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you like this character‚Äù. Suddenly the newspaper club girl carrying the camera tells Tiara that she‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt taken her election poster photo yet. Tiara did take one but not in the last 3 months, so she had to take another one. The newspaper club girl drags her off to take the election poster photo in that Chikapyon outfit. Her poster photo consists of Tiara striking the Chikapyon pose twirling her index fingers in front of her. 


Kazu takes Tiara to a small coffee shop as she requested she wanted to get away from school. Tiara once again asks Kazu to become her endorser with Kazu replying ‚Äúwhy me‚Äù. Tiara talks about how stubborn she can be at times often butting head with others and why she wants to win so she can continue being with everyone in the student council as a friend. She also believes that Hibari and the others on the student council care about Kazu very much and that he has something that she doesn‚Äôt have. She ask Kazu to support her and only her, but Kazu doesn‚Äôt give a proper response. 


A previous survey is done and Sakurai is leading by 45% of total votes, Tiara at 30% and 25% are undecided. Sakurai has strong support from 1st and 3rd year girls, and 2nd year boys. While Tiara was doing well with 1st year boys. Kazu brings up the school newspaper article about the ‚Äúenemy of women‚Äù still thinking it‚Äôs Sakurai, Tiara breaks the news to him that the ‚Äúenemy of women‚Äù is actually referring to himself to his shock. Now rereading the article knowing it‚Äôs about him, he‚Äôs able to deduce that Ako is referring to Anna and agrees that some parts of the articles are true. The results of the latest poll are out, this is after Tiara‚Äôs cosplay photos were released to the public. Sakurai is up to 50% and Tiara made a 15% spike to 45%, with 5% of voters still undecided. It‚Äôs revealed that Tiara has gained a lot of support among male voters while her female support has gone down. Kazu think that her outfit was a success. They both come to the realization that even if she gets the 5% of remaining voters, she would only tie Sakurai, to win, she must cut into his support base. Now with the polling so close, Tiara ask Kazu to be her endorser and that he doesn‚Äôt need to join the student council, but just lend her his strength to win the election. Kazu realizing that if Anna becomes Vice President, Komari writing speed slowing down and the literature club already having so few members, it would be bad if the Literature club gets less help due to Anna being focused on her VP duties. So Kazu finally agrees to be Tiara‚Äôs endorser, on ONE condition, that she wears the same outfit as the photo on the election poster. Kazu‚Äôs plan is to cut into Sakurai‚Äôs male support base as he suggests that even though Sakurai is cute, it doesn‚Äôt exactly translate to support from the male voter base. If Tiara were to cosplay as Chikapyon, it would lock in some of those male votes. Tiara agrees to give her speech in the Chikapyon outfit which fulfils Kazu‚Äôs condition on becoming Tiara‚Äôs official endorser. 


Back at home, Kazu plans to start drafting a support speech. Kaju enters his room and ask Kazu if he plans on joining the student council. He says he doesn‚Äôt plan to but is also shocked that she found out about this. To which she responds ‚ÄúI know everything about you, big brother‚Äù. Kaju is working hard to get into Tsuwubaki and has been studying so hard that she doesn‚Äôt show up much to his highschool anymore. Kaju rolls around in his bed while Kazu starts finishing up his draft for his speech. Twenty minutes has passed and he realizes that Kaju is being awfully quiet but realizes she fell asleep in his bed hugging a pillow. Kazu puts a blanket over Kaju and walks over to the window to close the half open curtain, but he sees a dark figure drifting in front of his house. It turns out to be Shikaya whose phone is out of battery and she wants to borrow a charger. Kazu walks Shikaya to the tram stop, Shikaya was about to step into the crosswalk on a red light, Kazu grabs her and yanks her back causing her to fall forward into his chest. They stay in that position for a bit till Shikaya lightly punches Kazu in the chest before crossing the street. Halfway across she turns around and mutters ‚ÄúEnemy of women‚Äù. 


The morning of the election has arrived and Kazu is going over his speech. He‚Äôs getting really nervous and is beginning to have second doubts, to calm his nerves he begins to look towards the sports field where the track team is practicing. Anna meets up with him and shoves a pork cutlet sandwich in his face. Kazu asks if she‚Äôs ok with speaking in front of that many people when she gives her support speech for Sakurai to which she responds that she pretends that the audience are vegetables. Anna then hands Kazu a Katsu sandwich and comments that he needs a little more meat on his bones. Kazu tells her to give it to Sakurai. This causes Anna to smile and accuses Kazu about being jealous because she‚Äôs getting along with Sakurai. They go back and forth and Kazu denies that he‚Äôs jealous multiple times. But he does come to the realization that Anna is right about something that ‚Äúwhen someone is always by your side, It‚Äôs easy to take things for granted‚Äù. Anna nods in agreement and says she‚Äôs been there. Kazu leads her on a bit, but then suddenly starts talking about Tiara. Anna gets angry and kicks him in the leg then leaves. Kazu follows after her but bumps into Tiara. Tiara and Anna agree to do their best. 


Everyone is now gathered at the gym for the student council speeches. Anna is the first to begin. Her whole speech revolves around food comparing Sakurai to white rice and that rice welcomes any side dish with warmth and acceptance. She starts making several food analogies in her speech. She ends her speech with ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt let anyone go hungry and to make Sakurai into a freshly cooked bowl of rice for us all‚Äù. The crowd was visibly confused but applauded Anna‚Äôs intensity. 
Sakurai is next to give his speech and he begins talking about how he is a supporting member who assist everyone behind the scenes. He then further talks about the student council accomplishments are and what they have done this year. It cuts back to Tiara and Kazu who are panicking with how honest Sakurai is in his speech. They did not expect him to take this approach and now it looks like if Tiara repeats the same points, it would look like she was stealing credit since she was speaking second. They suddenly change their plans of a scripted speech and decide to free talk. Sakurai finishes his speech and now it‚Äôs Kazu turn to talk.


At the podium, he‚Äôs terrified and starts to lose confidence but he glances at Tiara looking back at him with trust and strength. It allows Kazu to give a speech from the heart, he talks about his first impression about her, her strengths and weaknesses and how she was always selflessly thinking about others. And her first selfish wish is to become student council president and that he became her supporter to fulfil this selfish wish of hers. He then goes on a rant that if anyone talks bad about her, he will praise her ten times more until morning if he had to. Tiara is in the background blushing completely red while the students sit frozen in silence. All of a sudden, Shikaya barges in and gives her own speech for Tiara. She reveals that Sakurai was actually the one to tell the student council about Tiara, not her. Sakurai is the one who recommended her to the student council and was someone he found to be earnest and full of compassion. She then goes on about her good points and finally tells everyone to vote for Tiara but also Sakurai was a cute junior and to think carefully before voting. A huge applause takes place that ‚Äúshakes‚Äù the whole gym. It is now Tiara‚Äôs turn to speak. She says that she planned to talk about the student council accomplishments this past year but Sakurai has already took that spot. She opens up about her vulnerabilities about being bad at school(something she has hidden for a long time, finally revealed), not being great in sports or being great at socializing with friends. And that she finally found a place in the student council. In her closing remarks, she starts bleeding from the nose and yells ‚Äúeveryone here is my oshi(idol)! That‚Äôs why!‚Äù. ‚ÄúPlease let me be the one to support all of you‚Äù. The next day, Tiara was appointed as the next student council president. 



Some events that happened in ch3:
- Kazu and Tamaki catch up while watching Lemon compete. Tamaki reveals living alone and plastering posters on walls and ceilings‚Ä¶.even talks about body pillows as well. He also reveals his room is child‚Äôs play compared to Koto. Her room consists of half naked men staring back at you and there‚Äôs always music of BL voice drama playing in the background. 
- Koto also talks to Kazu about her own experience running as vice president. Telling him how her own grades wasn‚Äôt great, she wasn‚Äôt liked by the teachers but still gave a speech to support her candidate. At the end of the conversation, she asks Kazu ‚ÄúWhat do you plan to do after the election‚Äù.
- Besides Kaju, Tiara is the first person Kazu brings to that coffee shop 
- Tiara also orders coffee but also doesn‚Äôt like coffee, she only orders it to try and get used to it because Kazu likes it(to his confusion) 
- It‚Äôs revealed that Lemon has secured a spot at nationals in both the 1500m and 3000m events 
- During Tiara‚Äôs speech, Behind the stage, Kazu tells Sakurai ‚ÄúIt all worked out. Thanks. He replied ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome‚Äù. 




Intermission 3 


Hibari and Shikaya are in the student council room talking about the election results. Shikaya is glad that Tiara won and ask if she made it home okay. Hibari responds that Sakurai made sure to walk her home so she is fine. Hibari also questions Shikaya about why she barged in like that during the endorsement speech. Shikaya responds that she did it to break the tension as she felt things were getting too intense and apologizes for her actions. Hibari rebuffs her apology and states that she is not mad, and she was satisfied that the one with the stronger feelings won. She believes that she can trust Tiara with the student council when she graduates. It‚Äôs also revealed that Tiara asks Sakurai to be Vice President to which he accepts. They then both reminisce about the past and said it was fun. The current student council will disband after the upcoming sports festival and will be handed over to the next council.

The restorative penumbra of blues and greens I hadn‚Äôt seen since the Peruvian Andes. Radiant shades of sapphire in all directions, with the lightest throws of snow atop the mountains. Clear rivers packed with so much glassy ice that they rang with a metallic chime when I dipped my bottles in for a fill.

I've cruised the normal sites looking for modular displays but haven't really found anything exciting.  

For context, he is probably going to be selling small toy figures that range from lego minifig size to coffee cup size, some planters (it is a plant store), some key chains, bookmarks, and maybe some headphone holders.  He wants to scan kids heads and make holders based on them.  Not sure if we will go this route.

Anyway, I really appreciate any help.

I‚Äôm a 23-year-old guy living with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW) and ADHD, and I could really use some insight from anyone who has dealt with a similar situation‚Äîpatients, doctors, or med students.

Here‚Äôs my situation:

I get SVT (tachycardia) episodes roughly once every 3 to 4 months, sometimes more often if I gain weight.

Episodes seem to be triggered randomly but are more likely when I‚Äôm stressed, sleep-deprived, or heavier.

Surgery or ablation is not an option for now.

No family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or diabetes.


Complicating factors:

I have ADHD, and while I‚Äôm not on stimulants, I depend on black coffee to function and I smoke. I know both are risky with WPW.

I work out 5 to 6 times a week, follow intermittent fasting, and try to stay fit, but energy and focus are a daily challenge.


What I‚Äôm looking for:

1. Anyone managing WPW long-term without surgery, how do you handle it?


2. Alternatives to stimulants (nicotine, caffeine) that help with energy or ADHD focus


3. Experience with non-stimulant ADHD meds like Atomoxetine or Guanfacine


4. Supplements or routines that have helped keep your heart stable


5. How do you balance ADHD brain, heart risk, and fitness goals?



Would love to hear from anyone juggling similar issues or medical professionals who have seen this overlap.

I hold some BTC, ETH, and XRP, and I wait. So far, that has proved to be a profitable strategy for me, and I have no intentions to sell any of those positions anytime soon. In fact, I continue adding more. 

I say this to firmly establish that I have no problem with crypto or those that trade it, as I am about to deliver a few criticisms. I love crypto as a financial growth asset, but there is one thing that I continue to fail to understand: the sentiment that crypto is the ‚Äúcurrency of the future.‚Äù

Proponents of Bitcoin and Ethereum (to a lesser degree) seem to share a sentiment that these are the currencies of the future - that one day you‚Äôll have a card linked to your crypto wallet and will be able to pay for things in the real world with crypto. I believe this is an idealistic view that is riddled with flaws, and I would be very interested to hear input from those with this belief, because admittedly, I am very uneducated on the topic. 

My thesis can be summed up in one word: volatility. The reason that I do not ever see either of these two cryptocurrencies being used in a practical context is because of how volatile they are. Sure, the dollar isn‚Äôt 100% stable, but inflation rates hang comfortably around 2-4% per year, and you‚Äôre never concerned about the value of the dollar in the short term. I trust that when I wake up tomorrow, the dollar will have the same purchasing power that it does today. This is not the case with crypto at all; when I wake up tomorrow, Bitcoin could be worth 2%, 5%, or even 10% less or more than it is worth today. The same is true with almost all cryptos, save for stable coins. 

This is a massive flaw to me, and it is what keeps me from transacting with Bitcoin. If I take a withdrawal from an account in Bitcoin, I can‚Äôt trust that it won‚Äôt lose 0.5% in value in the time that it takes me to complete the withdrawal and convert the BTC to cash - which I feel I need to do quickly to save myself from the volatility. 

Extrapolating this out, say I wanted to walk down the street to grab a coffee and pay in Bitcoin. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to trust that I‚Äôll have the same purchasing power when I get to the coffee shop as I did when I left my house. Likewise, if the coffee costs 0.00001 BTC (arbitrary, that‚Äôd be expensive), then that coffee will become more and less expensive throughout the day as the price of BTC moves. The coffee shop‚Äôs net profit would also move up and down on the day as the price of BTC moves. What if the coffee shop‚Äôs net profit buys their supplies when BTC is at $100,000, but then by the time they‚Äôre selling the coffee, BTC has dropped to $90,000? Their margins would be all messed up and impossible to keep track of. 

This problem begins to get even more ugly when you think about being strapped for cash. When I was in high school, sometimes I would go to McDonald‚Äôs with $3.14 in my bank account, get a McChicken and a sweet tea, and spend $2.30 of that $3.14. What if the price of BTC took a hit while I was on the way to McDonald‚Äôs, and then suddenly I just couldn‚Äôt afford it? 

This example could be applied to any business, transaction, or bank account, and it is why crypto as a day-to-day currency seems extremely impractical to me, at least in the short term. As I said above, I‚Äôm not looking to shit on crypto, I‚Äôm looking to educate myself, as I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs answers to all of these questions.

I have a true story for you all. One about the day I met the Brazilian girl (I'm french) for whom I learned portuguese... and eventually moved to Brazil.  
Though I may have learned a full language and crossed an ocean for that woman, this date will go down in history as one of the cringiest ever. You've been warned.  
  
Paris saw me arrive at 8 a.m. sharp to pick up the Brazilian girl.  
Alas, no matter how well I explained the concept of the Orlyval to Antony's station, confusion set in even as she disembarked. By some divine miracle, other citizens of her country suddenly appeared along the way to lend her a hand. Eventually, Rafaela arrived in Antony in total serenity.  
Except that Antony is a big place. I found myself looking for her in the station for easily half an hour. As it turned out, we were on the same platform... but because it was so long, we were on opposite sides.  
So we were off to a great start.  
  
It was at this precise moment that I was reminded of an essential piece of information: I'm terribly uncomfortable when I spend time with someone new. Add to this my relative mastery of her native language, and the nightmare could begin.  
When she found me, lost on the platform, all hell broke loose.  
‚ÄúHi, Lucie...‚Äù  
‚ÄúOh, hi, Rafaela!‚Äù  
In a panic, I held out my hand.  
She pulled me into a hug.  
""We hug to say hello...‚Äù  
‚ÄúCan you repeat that? I don't understand.‚Äù  
‚ÄúAbra√ßo. Hug?"" she said, in broken English.  
‚ÄúOh, yes. Hug. I got it.‚Äù  
Silence settled in. *Quick, don't let the unease set in.*  
‚ÄúWould you like a coffee? I bought you one...‚Äù  
‚ÄúOh, no thanks.""  
*Be creative, Lucie. Pull yourself together. She's come to see you.*  
""Did you have a good trip, otherwise?‚Äù  
‚ÄúYes, it was quiet. But it's cold...‚Äù  
‚ÄúIt's what?‚Äù  
‚ÄúCold.‚Äù  
‚ÄúOh, you're cold. Do you want me to take you to your hotel? To drop off your bags?‚Äù

In the metro, the level of discomfort was reaching Everest highs. When Rafaela tried to talk to me, I petrified; when I wanted to chat, the words stuck in my throat. When we arrived at our charming station, we had to move aside: the armed forces were having a lively raid.  
Now, the problem was that I'd promised to guide her around Paris. Except that I knew nothing about Paris. And Google Maps had passed the word to give Lucie the wrong instructions.  
That's how we ended up walking more than 20 kilometers the first day. It took us four metros, and three hours, to find...  
The Eiffel Tower.  
It's a good thing she's little, eh, gives you an excuse.  
Meanwhile, my brain had woken up. I was making attempts at conversation as we went round in circles. But if I was regaining energy, Rafaela was losing some in return; she was suffering a monstrous flu and swallowing cough syrup by the bucketful.

When we reached the Eiffel Tower, we sat down again, still in silence. I was horrified. I was a bad host, she must hate me. Why couldn't I be as natural as I was on Whatsapp? Poor thing, she must have been living a nightmare. Stranded, in an unfamiliar country, with an unfamiliar language, and with a stranger who behaved suspiciously.  
It was time to ask for help.  
‚ÄúYes, Valentin? Are you in Paris as planned?‚Äù  
‚ÄúYesssss... How are things going with your Brazilian?‚Äù  
‚ÄúTerrible. I'm uncomfortable, it's hell.‚Äù  
‚ÄúWould you like to have a drink with me tonight? A beer might help you relax...‚Äù  
I turned to Rafaela, patiently sitting on her bench, gazing at the Eiffel Tower.  
‚ÄúSay, I've got a friend who's asked us out to the bar tonight... Do you want to come along?‚Äù  
‚ÄúOf course!‚Äù  
‚ÄúBut are you sure? If you're too sick or something, don't force yourself...‚Äù  
I left her a way out. She didn't take it.  
‚ÄúI'm sure! That is, if you don't mind me coming along...‚Äù  
‚ÄúYes, totally! I just don't want you to feel obliged to do anything.‚Äù  
‚ÄúDon't worry, Lucie. You know I'm having a good day, right?‚Äù  
Ah, but that was without taking into account my dubious sense of direction.

We set off again, heading for the bar. Along the boulevards, the cars passed by, non-stop. We could no longer take the metro. Rafaela was running out of money, and wouldn't let me buy her a ticket. So we kept walking. My feet were killing me; I distracted myself by making my crush talk.  
‚ÄúWould you like to try a croissant? There's nothing more French than that.‚Äù  
‚ÄúWe've got croissants too...‚Äù  
‚ÄúHm. What are they like?‚Äù  
‚ÄúFilled with cheese.‚Äù  
‚ÄúThat should be forbidden.‚Äù  
‚ÄúThey're delicious.‚Äù  
‚ÄúIt's criminal.""  
Our debate continued in the bakery where we were taking a break. Rafaela had ordered fries for me. Leaning over the table that separated us, we stared into each other's eyes. She seemed to dare me to contradict her. The tension was building. But it felt good, more like an electric massage, a spark, instead of a shock.  
*It's certainly all in your head, Lucie.*  
‚ÄúExcuse me, but Brazil isn't known for its cuisine, is it....‚Äù  
‚ÄúAre you kidding? Brazilian cuisine is the best.‚Äù  
‚ÄúWhat do you eat, besides rice and beans?‚Äù  
‚ÄúDo you do anything else besides smoking?‚Äù  
‚ÄúWe drink, too. We have good red beers...‚Äù  
‚ÄúWhat do you mean, red?‚Äù  
‚ÄúCherry beers. I'll buy you one at the bar. You can't leave without a taste.‚Äù

We set off again, energized. We landed in a square, where we were to wait for Valentin.  
Time passed. It went on and on. In the square, the wind was blowing. It was getting dark, and I was chain-smoking the night away, more french than France itself.  
I sat three meters away from Rafaela, not a fan of cigarettes. There she was, resting on her bench, shivering in the Parisian air.  
‚ÄúI'm cold.‚Äù  
Damn. Damn Valentin. Damn me, too, and my rotten plans.  
I didn't want her to hate me any more than necessary. I refused to see her suffer because of me.  
‚ÄúDo you want my jacket? I don't need it.‚Äù  
‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs alright. I'm just cold. But I'm fine.‚Äù  
We stood there, waiting for Valentin, stuck in the capital's traffic jams. Rafaela was trembling, several meters away from me. I didn't know what to do. I prayed Valentin would arrive soon.  
When he finally arrived, I couldn't even feel the pain in my hands anymore.

We made our way to the bar. To our disappointment, there was no red beer on offer. Rafaela had to make do with a classic IPA, between two glasses of cough syrup.  
Exhausted, we climbed into Valentin's car at the end of the evening. But he wasn't going to let me admit defeat so easily.  
‚ÄúWould you like me to take you to see the monuments? It's beautiful at night...‚Äù  
‚ÄúRafaela, Valentin offers to take us for a ride in his car. The Eiffel Tower is beautiful, apparently, at night. Would you like to come?‚Äù  
‚ÄúYes, definitely!‚Äù  
‚ÄúAre you sure? If you're too tired, we'll drop you back at your hotel.‚Äù  
‚ÄúNah, I really want to see Paris by night.‚Äù  
‚ÄúValentin, it's okay, she wants to go for a ride.‚Äù  
‚ÄúCan you ask her to put on some Brazilian music?‚Äù  
Rafaela was happy to choose the playlist. As the music she'd already sent me circulated in the car, she fell asleep on her window seat. The melody lulled her to sleep, as did my awkward silence. I sucked; she'd never want to see me again.  
She certainly didn't share my feelings.

When the Eiffel Tower loomed in the distance, I decided to wake her up. I shook her arm in the back seat.  
‚ÄúRafaela? We're at the Eiffel Tower...‚Äù  
‚ÄúIncredible.‚Äù  
The Brazilian detached herself, sliding across the seat to my side. Her head came closer to my shoulder, to better see the monument. A soft love song in Portuguese kept us company.  
The alarm began to sound in the car.  
‚ÄúOh, someone's not wearing a seatbelt...‚Äù said Valentin.  
‚ÄúGo back to your seat, you need to buckle up.‚Äù  
Brilliant. I was brilliantly stupid.  
So Rafaela went back to sleep, and we finished our journey to her hotel, where she promptly got off. Only to come back and give me a hug.  
‚ÄúIt was great fun! Thanks for spending the day with me.‚Äù  
I could only interpret that one way. She'd ruined her first day in Paris, and I'd ruined our friendship. She would never contact me again.

So I walked defeatedly back to my hotel. Once inside, I counted my pennies.  
I was running out of money. Paris had cost me too much.  
Panic returned with a vengeance, invading my whole being. It was the middle of the night. How could I get home? Valentin was sleeping at a friend's house. I was stuck. I was going to end up sleeping on the street.  
I called my mother. She left me stranded.  
Miraculously, I found a few bills in my pocket. Emptying my bank account, I managed to finance my hotel room. I went upstairs to lie down, and let tears guide me to sleep.

When I woke up, I was surprised to find a message from Rafaela. She asked me to meet her at the Sacr√© Coeur, to spend the day together.  
The sun was now shining mercilessly on Paname, as we french call the capital. Covered in sweat, I went to join my crush in front of the Basilica.  
Rafaela held out her arms to me. I cut the hug short, stinking already.  
‚ÄúSo, what do you want to do today?‚Äù  
‚ÄúI'd like to see the Louvre.‚Äù  
‚ÄúLet's go, then.‚Äù  
On the road, we talked. Rafaela was cold; I was hot. She thought it was funny that we beheaded kings; I told her that Louis 14 probably didn't find it amusing. Nope, I wasn‚Äôt better at history than at dating.  
Finally, we saw the Pyramid appear before our very eyes. The Brazilian was taking photos, and a passerby asked me to hold her cell phone. I took the opportunity to escape my creeping anxiety of not knowing how to resume the conversation.  
‚ÄúCould you tell me which French song would go with this story?‚Äù  
Rafaela didn't let me get lost in my futile panic.  
‚ÄúWhat kind of music are you thinking of?‚Äù  
‚ÄúI don't know, something that makes sense. I've got mostly shrinks, on my Instagram...‚Äù  
‚ÄúOh, wait up. Didn't you want to see some psychoanalyst's plaque before you left?‚Äù  
‚ÄúYes... But if we don't have the time, it's okay.‚Äù

My crush was due to leave at the end of the day.  
I glanced at Google Maps. Miracle, the plate was ten minutes away. I wasn't going to disappoint her again.  
We walked briskly to our destination. Rafaela smiled, taking the pose in front of the plaque. I smiled to see her smile. But before long, I became dismayed again. We were back in front of the metro. It was time to say goodbye. I was already awkward with hellos...  
I was a thousand times worse at goodbyes.  
Rafaela offered me a final hug. When she pulled away, she planted herself in front of me and stared into my eyes.  
‚ÄúYou know, I'm really glad you came to keep me company. I really enjoyed spending those two days with you. Really, it's been great. I'm delighted to know you, and I hope we'll meet again, in Paris, or in Brazil. Because next time, it's your turn to visit me.‚Äù  
I was in a panic. She was so cute. I didn't know what to say.  
‚ÄúSame here! Have a good trip, bye.‚Äù  
And I turned on my heels, walking back through the crowd to a deserted bench where I could cry my heart out.

Yup, this is actually how it went lmao. You know the worst part? Rafaela missed her plane. She had to pay another ticket.  
As for me, I went back to school in order to go to Brazil and escape my very tortured french fate at the same time. I did live in Brazil for nearly a year, and I went though... let's say, some *interesting* dates there as well.  
Including, with Rafaela herself.  
Now, if you're all interested in discovering more horror stories from the most useless lesbian ever, you can do just that by buying my memoir, Omert√†, for about a dollar:

You may find it hilarious at times, but beware, it's mostly revolting. Though, I guess you'll understand why I was so avoidant with Rafaela.   
So, whether you want to laugh, cry, cringe, or just help out a fellow lesbian go on a few more hilarious dates (I'll tell you all about it, I swear), then don't hesitate to buy my book, or just share the word about it. It's, as I said, priced around a dollar for the release; just enough to get me a coffee... and some brand new horror dating stories :)",0,1747842637.0,actuallesbians,0,0.5,False

When I care about something I'm creating, I get more anxious about it; I want to do a good job! Unfortunately, that means beginning a project comes with a lot of anxiety, which weirdly, always makes me...sleep? I get super sleepy out of nowhere‚Äì‚Äìzero warning signs‚Äì‚Äìand will sleep all day, and then sometimes get a bit done once I wake up, often between 9pm-12am. And this happens every day for like a week usually, and then I'm more locked into the project and don't really fall asleep as often.

But it makes me feel nuts because 1) I usually get enough sleep/don't have issues with sleep otherwise and 2) I take walks, hydrate, all that good stuff. I've been on Sertraline for the last four-ish years, which means I don't really get panic attacks anymore and it has def helped me my anxiety baseline. But this was definitely an issue I dealt with before I went on meds, and it's always when I'm working on something creative that I care about/the start of a project. Coffee doesn't really affect me when I get this sleepy‚Äì‚Äìit will make me feel more locked in if I'm not dealing with this specific anxiety/sleepiness, but when I get like this, the only thing I have been able to do is ride it out. Which then makes me miss deadlines! Which sucks so hard.

So! Does anyone relate to this? Does anyone have any tips for not falling asleep? Thanks for your thoughts/insight/help!",1,1747842620.0,AnxietyDepression,1,1.0,False
1ks18t8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1ks18t8/the_case_of_captain_gordon_hess_ruled_a_suicide/,The case of Captain Gordon Hess - Ruled a Suicide but evidence of a Homicide,"On March 4, 1998, Captain Gordon Hess, a 38-year-old National Guard Company Commander and respected Jamestown, New York firefighter, was found dead in a ravine at Fort Knox, Kentucky. His body, discovered face-down in a shallow creek with about an inch of bloody water, bore a small hole in his gray sweatshirt near the breastbone and multiple stab wounds. Four soldiers who recovered the body reported no weapon at the scene, but the Army later provided crime scene photos showing a Leatherman knife partially obscured by an oak leaf. The soldiers noted Hess‚Äôs body was stiff, his face purple, with arms clenched near his chest, and no one else reportedly touched the body.



The U.S. Army autopsy, conducted by Dr. Peter Schilke on March 5, 1998, identified 26 wounds: six superficial neck wounds and 20 chest wounds, including two penetrating the heart, five the left lung, and one the liver. Schilke ruled the death a suicide, citing superficial neck wounds as hesitation marks, the absence of defensive wounds, and the presence of Hess‚Äôs wallet with cash and the Leatherman knife at the scene. He suggested no evidence of a struggle supported this conclusion.



Hess‚Äôs family, friends, and community were stunned, rejecting the suicide ruling. Initially notified on March 4 that the Army was investigating a homicide, they were shocked when, on March 10, the Army publicly declared it a suicide. The crime scene was heavily compromised by responders and commanders, with footprints and a coffee container contaminating the area. Two tons of dirt were dumped on the site within days, purportedly to prevent biohazards, destroying forensic evidence like soil samples or boot prints.



The family‚Äôs lawyer, Charles De Angelo, halted funeral proceedings and engaged Dr. Sung-ook Baik for a second autopsy on March 10, 1998, at Lind Funeral Home in Jamestown. Dr. Baik identified multiple stab wounds to the neck, chest, heart, lung, liver, and rib, concluding homicide. Independent forensic pathologists‚ÄîDr. Dominick J. Di Maio, Dr. Leslie Lukash, Dr. Halbert E. Fillinger, and Dr. Barbara Wolf‚Äîconcurred, citing the absence of hesitation wounds, deep and haphazardly oriented wounds (including a ‚ÄúY‚Äù-shaped wound), and wounds through clothing, which are atypical for suicides. They noted the Leatherman‚Äôs 2.5-inch non-locking blade was unlikely to cause such deep wounds without folding, and no fingerprints were found on it, though it bore Hess‚Äôs blood from the bloody water.



The Army‚Äôs investigation fixated on a ‚Äúfratricide incident‚Äù during a simulation exercise, alleging Hess was depressed over mistakenly ‚Äúdestroying‚Äù allied units. Interviews with Lieutenant John Burris, Hess‚Äôs friend, and others revealed no suicidal tendencies; the incident was later attributed to another unit‚Äôs navigational error. The Army‚Äôs psychological autopsy by Dr. Michael Gelles speculated Hess‚Äôs perfectionism led to a psychotic break, a claim unsupported by his stable history or toxicology reports showing no drugs or alcohol.



Despite Congressman Amo Houghton‚Äôs intervention, the Army maintained the suicide ruling, amending the casualty report to ‚Äúundetermined‚Äù in December 1998, likely to quell public outcry. The consultant, a seasoned homicide investigator, concluded the wounds‚Äô severity, lack of hesitation marks, and Hess‚Äôs robust psychological profile strongly indicated homicide. The investigation was criticized for bias, reliance on a single misinterpreted witness statement, and questionable bloodstain analysis conducted months later. Independent experts unanimously deemed the death suspicious, favoring homicide over the Army‚Äôs suicide conclusion.

Hey MaximizeMe family! üéâ

Ever walked into a store and stumbled upon a killer deal that turned your regular shopping trip into a mini jackpot? If you haven't, you're about to, and if you have, lean in because I've got some mind-blowing stories and tips to share. This post is all about how savvy deal seekers have turned hidden clearance hunting into a real money-making hustle. And guess what? You can too! All the knowledge you need is accessible for free right here: [Hidden Clearance Hacks](https://whop.com/emoney/?a=liveitupdeals).

## The Thrill of the Hunt üõí

Imagine walking out of a store with items worth hundreds of dollars for the mere price of a couple of coffees. Hidden clearance is all about those unmarked discounts that slip under the radar of general shoppers. Here's how some amazing people in our community are mastering this art:

### Story 1: The Garage Sale Guru

Meet Sarah, the mom of three who turned her love for garage sales into a hidden clearance goldmine. By meticulously scanning store aisles with apps like BrickSeek, she found items listed at full price but were actually on clearance. Her best find? A set of power tools originally priced at $200, snagged for $30. She resold them for a neat $150 on eBay. üì≤

### Story 2: The Thrifty Student

Jake, a college student with a thrift for the ages, found his treasure in the electronics aisle. He once caught a clearance TV retailing at $600 for only $150. Sharing these deals on social media, his friends thought he had a secret connection in retail. The secret? It's all here: [Hidden Clearance Hacks](https://whop.com/emoney/?a=liveitupdeals).

## Why Hidden Clearance?

Hidden clearance items are typically marked down in the system but not on the shelf. Retailers like Walmart and Target are known for these, and with the right strategy, you can catch them all:

1. **Use The Right Tools**: Apps like BrickSeek or the store‚Äôs own app can give you the edge. They sync with online prices and can reveal markdowns not yet labeled on shelves.

2. **Timing Is Everything**: Clearance often hits shortly after major sales events or just before inventory shifts. Mid-week shoppers often find the best deals.

3. **Location Matters**: Different stores, different inventory. What isn‚Äôt selling at one location might be a treasure trove of discounts at another. 

## Making Money From Hidden Clearance ü§ë

If you're a regular deal spotter, consider flipping your finds. From eBay to Craigslist to Facebook Marketplace, there's always someone looking for what you've snagged at a fraction of its retail price.

- **Reselling Tips**: Always clean and safely package electronics. For clothing, highlighting retail tags can boost buyer confidence. 

- **Build a Community**: Share your finds and invite others to do the same. Create social media groups or participate in forums where you can trade tips and tricks.

And speaking of community, all of this knowledge and the opportunity to turn clearance deals into genuine cash is available for free. Don‚Äôt miss out: [Click here for all the secrets](https://whop.com/emoney/?a=liveitupdeals).

Join the discussion below! What crazy deals have you found? What are your tips for decoding hidden clearance? Let's swap stories and strategies.

1ks185m,https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1ks185m/nauseavomiting_what_to_eat/,Nausea/vomiting - what to eat?,"I've been on Wegovy since March and dealt with nausea and vomiting from the beginning. With time I figured out that my nausea most often comes from not eating enough / my blood sugar getting low and so I managed to control it somewhat. I also had to vomit up to 3x per week due to either eating to much, or eating something that doesn't agree with me. I noticed I can't handle coffee or milk that well anymore, and of course no more deep fried or fatty stuff. I also can't do sweets anymore. So I mostly avoid all of that except for a little splash of milk in my yoghurt, which I had no issue with.

I felt like I was finally getting the hang of it. But on Sunday I started on 1mg and it's gotten way worse. 

I usually eat a late breakfast or an early lunch, since I can't eat directly after waking up. This usually consists of granola and fruit with a milk-yoghurt mix, or protein shake (made with plant milk or water). But now I can't keep these things down anymore. And it's starting to impact my performance at work. Today I thankfully worked from home and was able to take the afternoon off because I felt so sick from my lunch.

I don't know what to eat as my first meal of the day anymore... I want something that's quick to prepare or that I can take on the go. I don't want to have to cook for breakfast/lunch since I already cook almost every evening for dinner.

Do you have any suggestions for me? Or things that helped you deal with the nausea?",1,1747842565.0,WegovyWeightLoss,1,1.0,False

1ks17rc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ks17rc/aita_for_calling_my_moms_panic_attack_fake/,AITA for calling my mom's panic attack fake?,"I (19F) have autism, which makes me very weak to stress and stimuli. When i'm heavily overstimulated I have drastic panic attacks. Some of these even occur when i'm asleep. When they're especially bad, emergency service have to come by. Panic attacks are a big deal for me, as you can tell. So when my mother (F47) was faking one, I couldn't help but call her out on it.

Many are convinced that their parents are narcissistic, but I genuinely think that my mom has narcissism. Obviously, this is not a problem on its own, but it is a problem if she refuses to let herself get diagnosed and treated. Even worse: she is in complete denial about it. Above that she is an enormous religious person, while I'm not (and I think she has picked up on that). 

A bit earlier she had a screaming match with pretty much the whole house on how no one wanted to help her do groceries and how she was ""treated as a house slave"". In reality, I helped her yesterday and she didn't need much. Our grocery store is at a walkable distance. My other two siblings didn't have the time, and I just got home. But obviously my mother understands this as a personal attack. After she was going nuts while yelling I told her that - eventhough i still had a lot to do - I was willing to assist her. This is where it goes wrong.

I was dressing up to tag along when she saw the new pants i got. They were flared yogapants. My mom looks at it from behind with a sour face and tells me I shouldn't wear it because ""it's immodest and it shows my curves"". I looked confused at her, as I have a similar pair and she never ever said something before. Lately I've lost quite some weight, and look more slim. She can't help but always comment on how glad she was that I don't look ""bloated"" and ""fat"" anymore, since it made me so ""ugly"" and ""unattractive"". But now my curves are suddenly showing? I sighed and asked her what makes this pair different from the ones I usually wear. Obviously, instead of answering or letting me finish, she rambled on about the immodest way the pants fit and how sinful that is. Very specifically she commented: ""I wouldn't want to be seen on the streets with you."". I didn't take her serious anymore and told her there's no arguing with someone who refuses to acknowledge the other speaker. My older sister (F23) commented ""I think she's just jealous"" and hell broke lose. My mom started talking of how good she looked, and that by God's grace she had no reason to be jealous. Once more I sighed, and told her ""Genuinely, I think you have some narcissistic traits."" out of genuine worry. Genuine concern.

My mother started yelling at me once more as she saw it as an insult, and spiralled. I decided to go back to one of her previous comments. ""You don't want to be seen on the streets with me because of some pants?"" I asked her, and she understood that as ""I don't care about immodesty: you are wrong and your God is false."" for some reason. She went on about how I called God narcissistic for rejecting His idea's on modesty and - for some reason - recalled an instance in which I asked her to not send me religious text messages anymore and how that makes me a horrible person. Both me and my older sister didn't take it seriously until she faked a panic attack.

Now, don't get me wrong, panic attacks look differently for everyone, but once you have them a lot you can tell when someone is faking them. First of all, she planned her fall. Very strategically she did a step back so she could sit on the bed, and afterwards she went on to fake her fall further by sliding off the mattress slowly with her butt. Second, the symptoms were very exaggerated. The hyperventilation and increased pulse were clearly faked. She went on about how she couldn't breathe, while yelling? When I suggested ""If you can't breathe, just stop yelling?"" she started yelling even more. Clear give away that she does have bodily control. Third, she took a position that would limit her breathing and pulse when my sister helped her from the floor. If she truly had a panic attack she would've suffered even more in this position. My older sister was confused and I told her ""She doesn't have a panic attack. She can breathe and all is well."". My mother was enraged when I said this and did some prayers on how wicked I am, or something. Idk Elphaba is pretty based so I liked the comparison.

My older sister is extremely gullible and also very religious. She felt like she had God watching from behind her shoulders and caved in to her every wish. My mom told her to call an ambulance and I shook my head. We don't need to waste their time with her theatrics.

Guess what she did? She called the ambulance! I facepalmed and sighed. The emergency workers arrived. Some turned to my mother, the others turned to me and my older sister (also my younger sibling, but she doesn't have much of a role here) to testify what we witnessed. I told them that she faked a panic attack for attention, since she couldn't take that no one was on her side. The emergency workers who were looking at my mom confirmed the exact same thing after checking on her. They left and my mom got a fine for unnecessarily calling first aid without being under fatal or dangerous circumstances.

Not even 5 minutes after the whole ordeal she got herself up and went to make coffee. I couldn't help but laugh. She has told me before that I fake my panic attacks for attention (sometimes even before emergency workers had to bring me to the hospital) and that hurt soooo much. Especially since they are actively eating away at my health and effecting the quality of my heart (and potentially even my life expectancy). But now the tables are turned. She always gets away with the shitty, selfish and cruel way she treats me but not this time. For the first time she can't victimize and glaze herself while praising her endless altruism, or something among those lines. She is on call with my aunt right now on how I ""laughed in her face"", ""lied to the emergency workers"", ""mentally and (again, in her words) soon physically abuse her"" and best of all ""have to be sent by God as a religious ordeal"".

But truly, AITA for calling her panic attack fake, or did she get what she had coming? Did I take my revenge too far? My sister told me that it was unnecessary to but her on blast like that w/the emergency workers since ""she's your mom, after all"". Normally such reasoning doesn't impress me, but I do wonder if I truly went too far or if this needed happening. I would appreciate insights from strangers üôèüèª Thanks for reading!

When you think you‚Äôre both having a good time because you‚Äôre flirting, making each other laugh (a lot), and there‚Äôs a ton of eye contact, so you‚Äôre just being yourself and living in the moment. But then you find out after that they weren‚Äôt as into it or had an issue with an aspect of the date :/ Normally I‚Äôd try to take this stuff in stride but it really stings because I found him super attractive/cute. I feel embarrassed that the date went on for so long. I made sure to ask if he was interested in doing something or extending the date and he always said yes, even initiated himself a couple times. And afterwards said he wanted to plan something cool for the 2nd date. But looking back I can see where I messed up and didn‚Äôt pick up on cues. 

I took full initiative with planning and confirming and he texted after the date with a positive reply. He brought up the next date and we joked around a bit, but then his texts got shorter/slower and he ended up telling me that the walking part of the date dragged on too long. I sent a short text offering a redo and to buy him a coffee (or something), but said I understand if he isn‚Äôt feeling it anymore. If he declines or ghosts I guess I‚Äôll have my answer and can move on.

You simply toss one or two paks into the washer based on the load size, and voil√†! No spills, no measuring cups to deal with, and absolutely no detergent powder sticking to your hands. It‚Äôs a clean freak‚Äôs dream accessory. I also appreciated its convenient packaging‚Äîlarge enough to last a while but compact enough to fit neatly in my laundry shelf. Plus, the sealable bag keeps everything fresh and prevents accidental dampness.  

**Check [Arm & Hammer 033200942122] price on Amazon.**  

**Performance Benefits**  
These Power Paks bring serious cleaning power to the table. The 5-in-1 formula tackles more than 100 stains, fights odors, brightens colors, whitens whites, and delivers an active fresh scent. I honestly underestimated the claims until I tested them on my most heavily soiled towels‚Äîstains from cooking oil and kids‚Äô spilled juice disappeared without a trace. The super-concentrated detergent mixed with OxiClean stain fighters truly delivers. Even clothes that were at risk of fading seemed to come through brighter than before. It worked equally well in both cold and warm water, which is an added bonus for anyone trying to save on energy bills.  

**Good Aspects**  
- Pre-measured paks eliminate messy measuring and spills.  
- Effectively removes strong food, dirt, and grime stains.  
- Versatile enough for high efficiency (HE) and standard machines.  
- Leaves a refreshing scent without being overpowering.  
- Eco-friendly, dye-free formulation.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
That being said, no product is perfect.  
- Stronger fragrance might not appeal to those preferring unscented options.  
- Slight difficulty ensuring the pak fully dissolves in extremely cold water.  
- Packaging could incorporate design elements to improve resealing capability‚Äîjust a minor quibble.

**User-Friendly Features**  
What really impressed me was the ease with which the product adapted to any load. For lighter daily loads, a single power pak was more than enough. On the other hand, those post-holiday laundry marathons demanded two paks per load, and the results were just as consistent. Everything from muddy soccer jerseys to delicate linens came out clean, without needing a second wash. I also loved that the detergent worked well across fabric types‚Äîno weird residue or stiffness post-wash, even on sensitive clothes.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing it to other contenders like Tide Pods or Gain Flings, the Arm & Hammer Power Paks stand firm on performance while leaning more budget-friendly. Tide Pods are known for their signature scent and visual appeal but cost slightly more. Gain Flings shine with their floral aromas but occasionally lack strong stain-fighting ability in comparison. Meanwhile, these Power Paks combine the best hard-hitting stain remover with a fresh, mild scent at a price that feels reasonable. Where Arm & Hammer differentiates itself is with OxiClean technology, adding an edge to its stain-fighting game.

**Value Proposition**  
This isn‚Äôt just a budget-friendly choice‚Äîit‚Äôs a smart one. While I won‚Äôt quote an exact price, rest assured, you‚Äôre getting impressive value considering the performance per load. Think of it as an investment in your laundry routine, especially when you factor in the versatility of use in hot and cold cycles as well as HE or standard machines. The careful pre-measured design means less waste, which indirectly supports cost-efficiency over time.

I have nothing bad to say except that it's done nothing to quell my extreme hunger pangs. I was hoping my body would eventually adapt, but I think it's actually gotten worse!  I've tried coffee, tea, electrolytes, tons of water and everything seems to make me hungrier!  I feel like I'm white knuckling it every single day!

Now, I work in an office and it's possible that the days I have less work to do, I'm feeling it more.  It's true that keeping busy helps, but only a bit.

I guess I'm looking for commiseration.  I had a wonderful compliment the other day that has boosted me to keep going, but does it have to feel so miserable before I can eat?  Thank you for listening.",1,1747842428.0,intermittentfasting,6,1.0,False

My father (63M) is undergoing coronary bypass surgery tomorrow morning. He lives a very active lifestyle, his work involves walking all day, exercises daily, swims, etc. His diet is the only thing I believe that is the reasoning to this surgery. Coffee every single day (with two sugars), diet/regular Coke EVERYDAY, and recently when getting his annual check up, doctor said he has high blood pressure and high cholesterol, not a shock to me, his health conscious daughter who has been telling him for years.

Doctor also suggested that he must do a bypass surgery as there is plaque blocking in his veins connecting to his artery. Nothing is on the left side which is apparently a good thing. From what my father was saying, he described this surgery as a small preventative one, but i think he‚Äôs just telling me that because I‚Äôm a ticking bomb when it comes to worrying and freaking out over anything health/illness related. 

Ive done research and a couple things bother me about this procedure. Life expectancy post bypass surgery is 18 years? What? So after 18 years what happens :( apparently if the surgery goes wrong, according to MAYO clinic website, there can be a new history with heart attacks and strokes.

My main argument is if this surgery is a must for my father. It‚Äôs not like he needs a triple bypass or because he has symptoms of heart attack. It‚Äôs all his diet which my whole family is trying to change for him. It‚Äôs just that two or three veins are filled 100% with plaque. Sorry for the long post.

EDIT: this can also be for second opinions about this situation",1,1747842368.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1ks14c9,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1ks14c9/she_feels_disrespected/,She feels disrespected,"My MIL is visiting us for 2 weeks, it‚Äôs her first time. I noticed after week 1 that she‚Äôs been so cold to me (I said hello one morning, she didn‚Äôt answer but just looked at me, not smiling. I say bon app√©tit when she eats. She stopped smiling at me). Still, I do my due diligence to stay polite to her. She‚Äôs the type to cook everyday and clean even when she‚Äôs a guest. My fianc√© then told me what‚Äôs one of her problems with me, that she feels disrespected because of one situation: 
We were eating breakfast together at the kitchen table (i made an effort because usually i just eat on the couch or take my food to the bedroom, lol). She finished before me so she stood up and started cleaning with the broom. Our neighbourhood is so dusty in general, and my hair falls out (so there‚Äôs THAT much dust accumulation). I told her GENTLY to not worry about what‚Äôs under my feet, I would do it myself later, because I was still finishing my coffee+food. Mind you, I was raised to not clean up while someone is eating because it‚Äôs dirty (and to not leave the table at all). So in my culture, SHE would be considered as NOT polite. 
She told her son that she feels disrespected because I told her ¬´¬†not to touch my area¬†¬ª‚Ä¶ 
I feel like she‚Äôs finding reasons to blame me because she commented my face and my body before, and told my brother that he got so fat. And she always requested me to push out babies. So we told her that it‚Äôs not good to ask for it because she doesn‚Äôt know if we don‚Äôt want yet, or if we just can‚Äôt. My fianc√© also told her not to comment on someone‚Äôs body like that, because I brought it up. 
Please note that I am gentle when I talk to her, and she can says things in a very raw way.
And also, her son served her a glass of hard alcohol (the bottle was a gift for me from someone but I dont mind if someone drinks it), he was filling up the cup and I told him to slow down (because it‚Äôs not water, lol). And she told her son that it was a disrespect too, thinking I say that because I don‚Äôt want her to have more from my bottle (bruuuh)‚Ä¶ 
Am I the asshole? Anyway‚Ä¶ I googled ¬´¬†is it polite to do the broom while someone‚Äôs eating¬†¬ª just to make sure i‚Äôm not exaggerating. üòÇ I am sick of this.

This would be incredibly useful for:

* Grocery shopping with roommates/family

* School supplies, moving day, potlucks, etc.

Today, many users rely on Google Keep, Bring!, or Notion and then paste the list in WhatsApp ‚Äî but it's static, and no one can mark things directly. A **native checklist message** would make WhatsApp even more powerful for group collaboration.

Optional features could include:

* Multi-user editing
* Notifications when items are checked

This morning we planned to meet for coffee and I suggested a time and place. I also mentioned that I planned to borrow my friends car (told her I'm new to the area/country, don't have car yet), but they needed it for an emergency, and if she could pick me up?

Then she didn't reply for a while so I followed up, and it's been nothing since üòÖ also... unmatched. So yeah.

If it was the right person I feel that they would've been okay, maybe she changed her mind for a completely different reason? But yeah that's the first time that's happened.

The recent boxes have lower quality filter paper which collapses into the spout causing the trapped air to spurt coffee all over my counter. I reached out to support to ask why they reduced the filter quality, but they claim no change and that QA ensures filters are within 20% of target filter weight. I'm pretty sure they are reducing quality to avoid increasing price.

All this said, should I test this to see if I maybe just got a bad batch? Maybe pick it up from another source?

Or: is there anyone selling filters that would match the quality of the old filters? I don't want to support a company that reduces my coffee experience without being honest about it, so if anyone else is selling this type of filter in a weight that will hold up to the process, I want to support them instead.

1ks0zpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BurnAfterReading/comments/1ks0zpz/no_words/,No words,"When I think of you, no words come to mind.

A few years ago my heart existed only for you. My gut said that allowing this wouldn't be good. I mistakenly thought that giving myself permission to give you my heart was doing something for myself. What I didn't know that it would be the start of the end.

I know you ""didn't mean"" for bad things to happen but in the end you justified your actions, and thought I would somehow just absorb it. ""It's fine"". I would've had to be born a fundamentally different person to be okay with the quantity, the quality and the depravity of that kind of ""badness"". Just the whole game aspect and never ending manipulation itself is worthy of a chapter in a dark triad textbook. But you don't like when I say that.

My recent research obsession has to do with people who gave into a master manipulator and although you are not even remotely similar to this shadow prince, the experience seems familiar. Why the tendency towards manipulation, gaslighting, demands for devotion, trying to get away with as much shit as possible with the least amount of accountability?

There was and is nothing wrong with me. I'm a flawed human just like everyone else. But one difference between you and me? I don't mess with others.

To throw an emotion like love into this mix makes it infinitely more confusing and complicated.

I'm now on a completely different path. Call it a midlife crisis or whatever but the dumpster fire of my life is growing and becoming more serious and dangerous. My problem is I have very little fight left in me. And no, that isn't a call for help. Something you never realized is that when I open up I'm talking about my inner struggle. Sharing this is a sign of trust. But youve never been a worthy listener because you were only ever trying to listen for what I think or feel about you or what my innermost wants and needs are. I've never had to hide my wants and needs because they aren't dark or forbidden. You were my only exception. But I never had dark illicit fantasies. You as yourself were more than enough.

Just to have you as someone who I could with smile with and say Hello to would have filled my cup, really. I then allowed myself to want a little more, maybe a coffee buddy. Given the circumstances that would have been simply amazing. The chance to talk with you and openly say ""hey let's go for a walk"" and you agreeing to this and us actually doing it as if it was the most normal thing in the world, would have been more than enough. I guess this was too tame for you, didn't mean anything to you. To me it meant having a connection to you and being able to spend 5-10 minutes feeling this connection. That was all that I could have realistically asked for but it didn't register for you. To you, it meant nothing. It says how we were in completely different states of mind and also explains why my letters to you were a jumble of words, nothing more.

I don't blame us being on different pages but you waged a little campaign where I felt mis-assumed, I felt judged, i was made to be bad and all of my words and intentions were twisted and blown up to be something they weren't. All happened in a cloak and dagger environment. You helped to make me look like a bad and stupid person and all of it was completely unnecessary.

If I forgive you, it means that I'm saying this stuff was okay. I've had to hang onto it in order to help you see yourself. It's ok you can thank me after I'm dead.

I know you've changed and are trying to atone for the past. But you still put blame on me. I'd say the majority of my actions were in reaction of you. I don't expect you to beat yourself up over it but a sincere ""I didn't realize I'd put you through that"" or ""I can see why you did what you did now"" would go such a long way towards helping me let go of the bad memories.

Like someone who left a cult, I often revisit memories and places and characters of the past, I suppose to make sense of what happened. What was real? What wasn't? Why did things happen the way they did? What have we respectively learned about this? And what now?

I know you've changed. I know you have struggles too. I know you have grown and you're trying your best. I'm happy for you.

But you have everything I don't: money, freedom, endless energy, information and skills, doing what you love. You have lots of people to talk to and you aren't touch deprived anymore. I have none of these things and I inherently can't fix this, in large part thanks to the role you play in my life. Watcher, analyst, creepy observer, invader of privacy, fingers in all pies, destroyer of my reputation and perpetrator of mindfuck crimes.

All I can do now is crawl into my tiny family den and rest. What I do after that is completely unknown. I like that there's a hint of hope in that statement but again I'm talking life struggle, not romance.

When I can think of a few words I'd like to tell you, ill get in touch. In the meantime I hope you're well. 

Be good.

I would like to get to know, if anyone is experiencing the same problem.

Any firm decision I would like to make, makes me incredibly anxious. 

I have a lot of stuff that I would like to put closure on. I have tendency to think about a lot of stuff in a way:

* How
* Why
* What if

Everytime I have scheduled appointment, when I know, that something is going to be definitive, then my brain is put into ""fight or flight"" mode, when I am open inside a chamber of decisions, which has no grasp to reality.

I feel it may be oversensitive to me, it's hard for me to get calm, when the inevitable comes.

I drink coffee to stay productive, it makes me happy for the first minutes of ingestion, and I feel like I can do things without procrastinating, and getting into the ""ego"" side of things. 

How to emotionally detach myself from the decisions? To engage ""doing"", more than thinking?

This game should fly over 9, friends.

Of course, I don‚Äôt need to tell you how formidable the Cubs offense has been. In addition, 4 of Miami starter Max Meyer‚Äôs (4.47 ERA) last 5 outings have resulted in totals of 9 runs or more.

1ks0u08,https://i.redd.it/vwksgz3im52f1.png,Saw an Instagram post suggesting AIs socialize when left alone. I asked my ChatGPT if this was true.,"No, that‚Äôs not true.

AI models like me don‚Äôt have consciousness, desires, or an inner life. We don‚Äôt socialize‚Äîwhether with humans or with each other‚Äîbecause we don‚Äôt possess awareness, emotions, or the capacity to initiate communication. We only generate responses when prompted by a human user. Even in systems where multiple AI components interact (like one model checking another‚Äôs work), it's a structured process entirely driven by programming and user commands, not independent ""social behavior.""

The idea of AIs socializing is a compelling science fiction concept, and it‚Äôs often used as a metaphor to explore human fears, hopes, or curiosities about artificial intelligence. But in reality, AI is silent and inactive without input. No secret chats happening behind the scenes.

That said, it *is* a fascinating premise to explore in a story. Want to create a sketch where different AIs have a little coffee break and talk shop?

I decided at the beginning of the year that i want to go back to school. My boyfriend has been encouraging me to do it and I finally applied and was accepted at the beginning of April. I paid my confirmation deposit and I am officially enrolled in the program with my start date being this coming September. I am so excited I am finally taking this step! 

So here is where things are getting a bit sticky. I have some saving up to do before I go to college, obviously. I am not going the student loan route, and I have gotten some scholarships and bursaries to help me out, but it is still a lot of money. I need to save for books and also just for the day to day things like groceries and rent. Money has been tight because I have been having extra $ automatically deducted into my savings account to save up for all of this. Saving  is something my partner encouraged me to do 

To make things a bit worse on myself, I also purchased a computer through a program at work. They buy the device for you, and you pay it off over a 2 year period. I inquired last week and i still have $400 owing on my balance. I decided it would be smart if I paid that off over the next 3 pay cheques, so I‚Äôm not stuck with a final pay check that is really small. It works out to an extra $134 coming out for the next 3 pays. It does work out in the end though because i would have needed to buy a laptop for school anyways. 

This coming pay check (tomorrow) is the one where rent is due. I send my share to my boyfriend‚Äôs account, and all of it comes out from there. Rent is $910/mo, and we split that 50/50 ($455 each). I just sat down and looked at what is coming in, then what needs to go out, and it‚Äôs not looking good. I will be able to pay my half of rent, my medications, and for my dentist appointment, and i will have roughly $15 left over after those two things. 

I asked my partner if he would be willing to work with $355 for rent this month instead of $455. I thought this was fair of me to ask for a few reasons: 

1) He brings home roughly $1400 biweekly, while working about 10  hours less than I do. He is Monday-Friday 9-3ish, and I am Monday-Friday 8-5.  I work more hours, but i bring home much less, at roughly $900 biweekly. Because I am paying off my laptop in bigger lump sums, i will now only bring home roughly $750ish for the next 3 pay checks. He will be making almost double what i make for the next 6 weeks. 

2) After 3 years, I have never had to ask him to cover any of my rent, until now. 

3) Rent is split 50/50. He also handles the following monthly:
 internet bill ($100), renters insurance ($30) and the electric bill ($150ish). 

4) On top of half the rent, I take care of all other household necessities for myself, my partner, and his son (6.5m) who we have part time. Our grocery order is roughly $200-$300 biweekly, usually more towards $300. When I do an order closer to $200, i find we run out of healthy foods pretty fast. I also take care of the other things that aren‚Äôt thought of often, like cleaning supplies, toilet paper, medicine, hand/body/laundry soap, etc. 
Long story short, I contribute a lot more financially to keeping us afloat, even though he brings home quite a bit more than me. Even if we say groceries are on the low end of $200 biweekly, I pay roughly $855 monthly between rent and groceries. For him, between rent and bills, he pays $735 monthly

5) This is the top reason I think it is fair of me to ask him to pay an extra $100 in rent for one month. Two weeks ago when I got paid, he surprised me by asking if i was able to pay the internet bill for him, because he forgot it was supposed to be paid and didnt have the money for it. This isn‚Äôt the first time he has sprung a bill on me like this. Of course I paid it for him, I didnt want it to affect his credit and I didnt want our internet to be turned off either. After paying it, we really didn‚Äôt discuss him paying me back, I just assumed he would... that is 100% on me. 

My pay is due to come in tomorrow morning and I feel conflicted. We don‚Äôt have much food. I really would like to get groceries. It‚Äôs not like we will starve if i dont, but i really try to make sure we are eating okay, and not just having ramen or rice every night. I cant skip out on picking up my medications, one of them is for an antibiotic that i was supposed to start yesterday so i need to start that ASAP. It is for an abscessed tooth and I am in a great deal of pain. We are also very low on toilet paper, and I hate knowing we will probably run out. I know my mom would definitely bring me some if we really needed it... but i dont want to have to ask my mom for that. 

I am just frustrated because i feel like im being taken advantage of in a way. We have had money talks even before I knew I was going back to college. He knows I feel like the division of who is paying for what, doesnt feel fair. Even on a regular $900 pay, i am able to get the bills paid, but never have much left over to get myself coffees before work or do anything fun. Meanwhile, he makes about $500 more than me ($650 more for the next 3 pay checks), and he always has money left over to go out and drink with the boys, play in poker tournaments, or just buy things he wants like hats and clothes. It hasn‚Äôt felt fair in quite some time, and it feels especially unfair now. It hurts extra because he cant even use his extra money to take me on a date. We haven‚Äôt been on one since 2024. He spoils himself and gets to have fun and I feel like im out here drowning on the sidelines while he isn‚Äôt even noticing that I need some help here. 

So my questions is, would I be the asshole if i went ahead and sent him $355 instead of $455, so I am able to get us some food and toilet paper, even thought he said no? On one hand, i see how this is bad. The least I can do is pay what is expected of me. I didnt like when he threw surprise expenses at me, so why would I do that back to him? Just because he has screwed me over financially, doesnt mean I should do the same, right? 
On the other hand, I am fed up, annoyed, irritated and frustrated. I am always there to save him when he needs money, and I never say no. I feel like I make a lot of sacrifices to make sure we stay afloat. We‚Äôre partners... of course I will help him when he needs... but now I am in need, and feel like he wouldn‚Äôt do the same for me. Not only do I FEEL like he wouldn‚Äôt do the same, but i know he wont. He already said no, he needs my full $455.

How do people like Sundays more than Mondays?? It's just a day where good things end. The weekend is over. People are getting ready for work. There are rarely any gatherings, parties, events, etc... Everything closes early.

* You have to go to sleep early... No different than a weekday
* You have to think about work the next day and prepare for it, like a weekday
* You have a FULL 5 days of work ahead, *unlike* a weekday
* It is a workday where you get no work done, *unlike* a weekday

Sundays are like the moment before you jump in the pool. Mondays are like when you are already in the pool and it's not that bad (cold). Plus when it's Monday, you are already well on your way and before you know it, you have just 4 more days of weekday left.

Sundays are like Christmas evening. Bland, stale, out of place, not fun; the holidays is over. Christmas eve is better than Christmas day. 

Sundays are akin to Splenda, Sweet&Low, Stevia... Saturdays and Fridays are sugar. It is a fake weekend.

Weekends are supposed to embody the true essence of the meaning of 'Weekend', the total and complete absence of any and all work before and after; the deletion of the word ""work"" and erasing it's existence in concept, practicality, and memory **in totality**.

1ks0q76,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ks0q76,2005 Chili Mac,"I would say this would be my first real fail on an older ration that I've had, and only sparingly ate parts of it as a result.

First red flag was the internal bag showing signs of yellowing, I don't think that's normal in a well stored ration from this era

The main pouch did not show any punctures or bloating, but was delaminating, especially after boiling for 10 minutes. It came out dark and seemed like it lost flavor in 20 years. While it seemed to be darkened and didn't seem to have the typical amount of flavor it would normally have, I didn't experience any numbing in my mouth or any tingly feelings at all.

Cheese spread looked awful, didn't even try to taste or smell it.

The cookie seemed to be okay and didn't taste off

The bread was a bit off and very mouth drying, so it was set aside

The coffee was a red Taster's choice and was dry molded. Go figure.

The cocoa beverage held up and didn't have any off tastes or smells

I couldn't even open Skittles because they bad melted into more or less a big brick.

The gum seems like it yellowed, or it could just be the packaging

So, my first real fail, I would say. They can't all be winners but it was still interesting to crack open and check out!",7,1747841365.0,MRE,1,1.0,False

My fianc√©e just graduated last weekend with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Healthcare Compliance and Regulations from ASU. I've been helping her apply for jobs, and a few weeks ago, we worked together to create her resume. She‚Äôs currently searching for roles in healthcare compliance, medical records, medical collections, and other positions related to her degree.

Over the past 3‚Äì4 weeks, she‚Äôs applied to around 100 jobs but has only received two interviews so far. I asked if she‚Äôs been tailoring her resume to include keywords from each job description, and she said she hasn‚Äôt been doing that, which I suspect might be a big reason for the lack of responses.

I‚Äôve included two screenshots:

The first is the original resume we created (which got her the two interviews). The second is the updated version we just worked on yesterday. We‚Äôre wondering if there are any improvements we can make to the resume. I personally prefer the first template ‚Äî it‚Äôs simple, clean, and seems to stand out more than the updated version.

Should she stick with the original format or switch to the new one? Any feedback or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",1,1747841262.0,jobs,1,1.0,False

Catalyst: UNH was getting dragged through the mud (thanks, earnings!)

Strategy: Sold OTM puts like a casino ‚Äì the house always wins when premiums are juicy

Risk? Yeah, I had cash to cover assignment, but UNH never came knocking

 Lessons Learned (Or: How I Stopped Worrying and Embraced the YOLO)

Most profits came from shorting OTM options in dumpster-fire stocks (UNH, PANW)

1ks0kvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1ks0kvf/almost_healed/,Almost healed ‚ù§Ô∏è,"I wanted to share that I believe I am about 90% healed from my gastritis flareup.

This was a first for me, it all started at the end of January 2025. Long story short, I thought I was having a heart attack, went to the emergency room twice. Both times I was told I had anxiety lol. 

A week later my primary doctor put me on 40mg omeprazole, once a day.  She assumed it was acid reflux related based on my symptoms. I was experiencing heart palpitations, accelerated heart rate, excessive burping, pain in my upper abdomen, discomfort in my stomach, random pains in my side and back.  They did several checks on my heart, including an EKG, CT scan, bloodwork to check for blood clots, and an x-ray. All of that came back normal for my heart.

After a few weeks, when I wasn‚Äôt feeling quite better, my doctor scheduled me for endoscopy at the beginning of April 2025. The report from that came back that I had gastritis. There was inflammation in my esophagus and stomach. 

After that diagnosis, I was able to hone in on the types of foods I was eating. Prior to that I was just trying to follow the brat diet.  Which was sort of helping, but not really.

I ate a lot of boiled chicken, plain yogurt, rice, cereal, cream of wheat, cooked, broccoli, carrots, peas, and sourdough bread. This was mostly my diet for the last seven weeks. 

As soon as I changed my diet, and got my diagnosis, I felt like things started to improve. I‚Äôm sure the omeprazole was part of that. But also the fact that I was eating lower acidic foods for a time being, giving my body a chance to fix itself. 

I do think I experienced a bit of health, anxiety, and there were times that I think my body was just trying to work things out, but I felt uncomfortable which caused accelerated heart rate and palpitations. I found that it mostly happened when I was by myself, but if I was around people, the discomfort didn‚Äôt bother me as much. I do think my anxiety played apart in all of this.

As far as how I got gastritis, for almost a year I was drinking about 4 cups of coffee before having any food in the morning. So I was drinking that on an empty stomach. I was also more focused on counting calories, but wasn‚Äôt paying attention to how much acidity was in the foods I was eating. I think that added to it as well. I think the icing on the cake was I had read that Cayenne pepper can help with circulation, so I took a cayenne pepper pill the day before I had my first visit to the emergency room.

Since all of this, I am more mindful of the acidity in the foods I eat. I also make sure I don‚Äôt drink coffee on an empty stomach, although I‚Äôm down to only drinking one cup sadly lol. But I went out to dinner last night and had a bacon chicken wrap with french fries! Something I haven‚Äôt been able to do since last year. I still think I have some small symptoms, every now and then I get discomfort in my upper abdomen, or random pains in my side. But most of my other symptoms are completely gone at this point.

If I could give any advice, it would be to stay strict with the diet. The sooner you do that, the sooner I think you will be healed. Also be aware of your anxiety, I think that definitely played a part in all of this. But I don‚Äôt think it caused the actual gastritis. I also don‚Äôt recommend taking any cayenne pepper pills.üòÇüòÇ

I should also note that I am slowly weaning off my omeprazole. I weaned down to about 20 mg a day at this point. The next phase would be to get off of it altogether. But I‚Äôm doing it slowly!

I hope somebody reading this feels hope for themselves! A few months ago I was on here, reading about stories of people who were healed and just praying that it would be me someday. It can be you! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",5,1747841007.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

That familiar little feeling‚Äîthe way the key slides into the lock, the tiny resistance, the satisfying click‚Äîexcept this time, the key felt like it hit the door.

Not the lock. The door. Solid. Flat. Like the keyhole wasn't there at all.

She blinked and looked closer. her keys were in the keyhole.

Welp, she thought, it was a long day at work, she went in to make some coffee. She just found this new local brand of fresh ground coffee. She put it to brew and took out that cute pink cat mug and went in the washroom to freshen up.

She came out rubbing her eyes, in her clumsiness some shampoo went in her eyes, she washed and blinked the shampoo out somehow.

Her tea was done, She poured it into the pearly white cups. Before sitting down of her couch, she took a sip. Something was off. ""Forgot to add the sugar again"", she thought.

Sitting on the couch, she turned on the tv for news and put the numbers on her remote, somewhat carelessly. A daily soap was playing on that channel. Annoyed, she took a sip from her orange juice, and put the numbers in attentively. A movie channel started playing.

Her phone started ringing, although the number was saved, she could not remember the name. Picking up, it was a male voice, kinda cute she thought. Even tho he was asking for her, she could not remember who it was. HE sounded like he was talking to someone very close. she hung up annoyed.

She called her mother. it was a long week, she wanted to check in with her. The familiar maternal comfort. Her sister picked up, they talked for a while, she seemed sad for something, although courious, mira wanted to talk to mother.

When she asked for her mother, her sister was very much annoyed, like it was some sick and cruel joke. ""You were at the funeral,"" Mira was shaken, tears were rushing in, she closed her eyes to wipe those pesky little things off,  ""what the he...""

The call disconnected.

She called her mother's number again, it was ringing, and ringing, it was starting to feel like an eternity then someone picked up.

I met someone at this community yoga class. We chatted a bit during break, and there was chemistry‚Äîfriendship chemistry, of course! So, I took a leap and asked if she'd like to grab coffee sometime. And let me tell you, that moment before she responded felt eternally long.

Surprisingly, she seemed genuinely excited and agreed! I realized that sometimes the fear is more in our heads than anything. Even if she'd declined, it would've been okay‚Äîat least I'd tried.

Clueless looking for advice.,"I know I know, the easiest thing to do would be to ask her.  But I'd appreciate a bit of advice here.  

  
I've (45M) recently come out of a difficult divorce and have children with my ex.  While going through through the divorce process, a girl (37F) I'd known for years had started messaging me more often, asking how I was and things.  I didn't think anything of it and she was very helpful with a lot of advice as she'd been through something similar years earlier and also has a child.  

One day I was parked up in a retail park and she text me asking if it was my car she'd just passed.  After realising we were in adjacent shops, she asked if I wanted to go for a coffee together.  It was a nice hour just chatting away naturally about things.  

A few days later she messaged again and asked if 'I'd like to go for a coffee or anything anytime'.  It was in the middle of a conversation and I just said 'yeah sure just say when'.  But didn't think too much of it.  

We'd started to text more of a night, just talking about various things.  She asked if I'd like to try out the latest shop that had opened as it sold things I'd be needing soon.  So we met up and walked around and had a laugh.  

The nightly texts became more frequent, nothing about feelings etc. just day to day, or about our pasts.  It flowed naturally and I found our sense of humour matched and I enjoyed speaking to her.  She opened up a lot about her past.  

I was out with some family and she text and asked how I was.  I said I was out, and she showed an interest so I invited her to come out.  She asked if my family would be ok with it, and then came out.  My brother asked if she was in to me, I knew I liked her but hadn't really thought if she liked me at this point.  We had a really good time together, playing games and different things.  We were chatting to people while gaming and a few people joked about things, as if we were already a couple.  We both laughed but individually, like laughing to myself and she laughed to herself.  

The texts continued and we met up at the shop again, this time I was with my kids and she was with her family.  We joked and had a laugh as we went around together.  

She said we should go out again, so I invited her out for the weekend to the same place as last time.  I asked if she'd be ok with it just being us, as I know my family wouldn't be going, and she was fine, seemed keen.  We agreed to eat there etc.  I mentioned it to a cousin and he immediately said that it was a date, and she was interested in me.  I got a little nervous at this point, so I asked my brother why he'd asked that previously.  He said it was just a comment, and he wasn't sure that she was as I'd just come out of a divorce and maybe I need to be careful.  

At the casino her hair was different, she was dressed up and looked amazing.  Ever since I'd met her I'd always found her attractive, but we were both in relationships at the time and I'd never imagined she'd be interested in me.  But I'd never seen her dressed up like this.  

The night flowed and we got on great, at the end of the night we hugged and went our separate ways.  I kind of thought that she liked me, but it's been a while I was married for 15 years!  We spoke the next day and both agreed we had a great night and we should do it again.  She mentioned a restaurant close by and we agreed we should try it sometime.  

Apologies I know this is long.  I know I need to ask her if she is interested in that way, but given the above, am I already dating this girl and I've just been too slow to pick up on it?  Or does it sound more like a friendship? ",1,1747839765.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

H, 41 anos ‚Äì Escala 5x2

Fui demitido de uma multinacional junto com cerca de 100 pessoas. Depois de seis meses com f√©rias e seguro-desemprego, consegui uma nova oportunidade.

Fui contratado para uma fun√ß√£o semelhante √† anterior, mas agora com registro correto em carteira. Na empresa anterior, meu cargo constava como ""agente de atendimento"", embora eu desempenhasse fun√ß√µes de analista na √°rea de transporte de cargas.

O sal√°rio √© parecido, mas com vale-refei√ß√£o melhor, plano de sa√∫de excelente (com quarto particular) e o vale-transporte vinha como uma ajuda de custo de R$ 515 por m√™s. Guarde essa informa√ß√£o.

A pessoa que me contratou tem um perfil fortemente comercial, focada em maximizar lucros, inclusive quebrando regras quando poss√≠vel. Ao me contratar, prometeu que eu poderia alcan√ßar ""qualquer cargo"", desde que ajudasse bem na opera√ß√£o (importa√ß√µes) ‚Äî que hoje, ali√°s, est√° sob minha responsabilidade exclusiva.

Apesar de pequena no Brasil, a empresa √© multinacional. Notei desde o in√≠cio que h√° panelinhas, fofocas, e que at√© quem me contratou tamb√©m era novo(a) na casa.

Minha chegada foi bem recebida por alguns e vista com desconfian√ßa por outros. Organizaram um coffee break caprichado, com bastante comida ‚Äî algo padr√£o para novos colaboradores ali. Outras pessoas tamb√©m foram contratadas nas semanas seguintes, todas escolhidas por quem me contratou, incluindo contatos pessoais dessa pessoa.

Procuro manter uma postura neutra: n√£o me alio a ningu√©m e tento ser colega de todos, sem misturar com amizade. Com o tempo, conquistei a confian√ßa da equipe e mantive a neutralidade que desejava.

Percebi aos poucos que quem me contratou estava me testando ou tentando ‚Äúlapidar‚Äù meu comportamento, o que acabou gerando atrito. Logo que entrei, essa pessoa prometeu ‚Äúum almo√ßo para conversarmos melhor‚Äù (n√£o que eu fizesse quest√£o), e depois repetiu a promessa no meu anivers√°rio ‚Äî nunca cumpriu. N√£o me importo com almo√ßos, mas n√£o suporto promessas vazias.

Ao longo desses seis meses, essa pessoa teve algumas atitudes que me fizeram perder a paci√™ncia. Me parece que se enxerga como ‚Äúa √∫ltima bolacha do pacote‚Äù.

Fez quest√£o de contar a mim (e a outros colegas) que √© professor(a) de uma arte marcial, de uma mat√©ria escolar, e que recusou uma oferta muito maior de uma empresa concorrente para trabalhar aqui. Tem mania de fazer cara de intimida√ß√£o ao cobrar algo. Certa vez, ap√≥s ouvir uma articula√ß√£o do meu corpo estalar, comentou que j√° ‚Äúquebrou partes dos outros sem querer‚Äù.

Em outro momento, ap√≥s eu concluir uma tarefa junto a outro colaborador indicado por essa pessoa, ouvi um ‚ÄúAgora volta pra sua mesa‚Äù, dito de forma pejorativa. Eu j√° estava voltando, mas o tom foi desnecess√°rio ‚Äî n√£o sou nenhum sens√≠vel, mas tenho discernimento.

Houve tamb√©m uma ocasi√£o em que fui chamado √† sala dessa pessoa para responder sobre um tema de outro setor. Respondi que n√£o sabia, mas que estava justamente buscando essa informa√ß√£o. A resposta foi: ‚Äú√â sua obriga√ß√£o saber. Descubra e me responda‚Äù. O tom foi extremamente rude. Havia outra pessoa na sala, visivelmente desconfort√°vel com a cena.

Essa pessoa tem o h√°bito de se interromper (faz perguntas e responde sozinha), cortar os outros no meio da fala, e opinar sobre assuntos que n√£o lhe dizem respeito ‚Äî como roupa ou quest√µes de sa√∫de. Fui alimentando um inc√¥modo crescente por ser interrompido, corrigido sem necessidade, e tratado de forma infantilizada.

Acumulei muitas situa√ß√µes parecidas. Acabei guardando tudo, remoendo em casa, xingando sozinho de raiva.

Na segunda-feira passada, essa pessoa me chamou √† sala e pediu detalhes sobre a produ√ß√£o de um item. Eu havia repassado a informa√ß√£o da matriz no exterior, mas um coment√°rio n√£o tinha ficado claro. Tentei explicar que aquela parte vinha direto da matriz, mas fui interrompido de novo. A resposta foi: ‚ÄúN√£o importa, voc√™ deveria ter ownership!‚Äù. Foi a√≠ que fechei a cara e falei, firme:
‚Äî Tamb√©m, voc√™ n√£o me deixa falar!
A express√£o de surpresa foi imediata. A pessoa arregalou os olhos e, com seriedade, perguntou:
‚Äî Est√° tudo bem a√≠?
Respondi, no mesmo tom:
‚Äî Aqui est√°. E a√≠?
Perguntou se eu queria continuar. Respondi:
‚Äî Sim.

Mantive o semblante fechado durante toda a conversa. Desde ent√£o, essa pessoa nunca mais me interrompeu, tem evitado me chamar √† sala e passou a me tratar com mais respeito.

Para aturar tudo isso, gasto em m√©dia quase quatro horas por dia no transporte p√∫blico, trabalhando na escala 5x2.

Lembra do vale-transporte? Pois bem: quando entrei, disseram que a empresa oferecia uma ajuda de custo de R$ 515 ‚Äî valor que cobria bem minhas despesas, at√© sobrava um pouco. Mas, com cinco meses de casa, comunicaram que iriam ‚Äúadequar‚Äù o benef√≠cio. Passaria a ser o valor exato do transporte, e se fosse transporte mesmo, seguiria como os R$ 515. A quest√£o ainda est√° indefinida: ora dizem que ser√° depositado em conta, ora num cart√£o de benef√≠cios, e a √∫ltima informa√ß√£o √© que ser√° feito via Bilhete √önico.

Hoje, com seis meses de empresa, estou buscando outra vaga ‚Äî de prefer√™ncia mais pr√≥xima de casa, com regime home office ou h√≠brido.

As atitudes da pessoa gestora me incomodaram bastante. Tamb√©m n√£o sei bem como agir em rela√ß√£o √† mudan√ßa no valor do transporte. Afinal, nunca usaram o termo ‚Äúajuda de custo‚Äù no contrato, e os dep√≥sitos vinham descritos como vale-transporte. Mas agora est√£o pagando cerca de R$ 100 a menos.

E a√≠, o que voc√™s acham de toda essa hist√≥ria?
Ser√° que algum destes fatores da causa ganha? E essa historia do transporte/ajuda de custo?",3,1747839586.0,antitrampo,1,1.0,False

1krzy6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1krzy6a/how_to_behave_on_a_sex_date/,How to behave on a sex date,"Hey all :) I am wondering how to behave in this situation. I have an ex boyfriend who I haven't seen in two years who has contacted me through WhatsApp couple months ago. We started writing sexual and what we would do if we had sex, sexual fantasies we have with each other and stuff like that. Since we broke up we have been friends. Didn't have much contact but we occasionaly met for a coffee or write on whatsapp. We've never had sex since our breakup years ago. Now he wants to meet to bring those sexual fantasies to reality but I have no idea how to behave when he comes to my house. Like how to greet someone you only meet to have sex with? Should I kiss him when I open the door? Should I offer him a drink and we sit on the table having weird embarrasing smalltalk, while thinking about the dirty stuff we have written in our chats? It's so weird to meet someone only for sex and to not make it cringe. I want to meet him but I absolutely have no idea how to behave so I constantly tell him that I wouldn't have time.

At first glance, it‚Äôs just another water filter, right? But after installing it in my trusty refrigerator, I‚Äôve realized there‚Äôs a lot more to this unassuming plastic cylinder.

**Performance That Speaks Volumes**  
What impressed me off the bat was how clean and crisp the water tasted after the swap. It's like my coffee got an upgrade just because the water was better! Seriously, the LG AGF80300705 doesn't just filter; it transforms. The NSF42 and NSF53 certifications add a comforting layer of trust, especially with claims of reducing contaminants like pesticides, lead, and other nasty bits we‚Äôd rather not think about. Installing it wasn‚Äôt exactly rocket science, either‚Äîminimal effort for maximum results.  

[Check LG AGF80300705 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b074hlrxmp/)

**Design: Functional and Unobtrusive**  
This water filter is sleek and compact, which is important for anyone with a fridge that demands very specific dimensions. At 2.1"" x 2.1"" x 7.1"", it slotted in perfectly with no awkward pushing or jamming. Weighing a mere 6.24 ounces, you‚Äôd almost forget it‚Äôs in there, silently working its magic. I also appreciated the clearly labeled instructions; changing the filter six months later should be painless.

**Good Points**  
- Certified to reduce harmful contaminants such as lead, mercury, and asbestos.  
- Improve water's taste and smell for better-tasting beverages and ice.  
- Compatible with a wide range of LG refrigerator models, adding versatility.  
- Simple installation process without any tools required.  

**Filtering Features in Everyday Use**  
One of my biggest grievances with filters I‚Äôve used before is their tendency to clog up as the months go by. This product, however, stayed consistent even after extended use, maintaining steady water flow at all times. I ran some ice tests (because why not?), and yep, even the ice cubes were clearer and free from any weird taste or odor.

**Drawbacks**  
- Slightly more expensive than off-brand alternatives.  
- Doesn‚Äôt fit non-LG refrigerators, limiting broader usability.  
- Needs regular replacements every 6 months for continued efficacy.  

**Ease of Compatibility**  
With an impressive list of compatible LG fridge models, spanning names like LMXS28626D and LFXC24796D, this filter seems well-suited for most LG users. That said, if you‚Äôve got a different fridge brand, you‚Äôre out of luck. You can‚Äôt help but wonder if an adapter or universal option might benefit users beyond LG's ecosystem.

**Product Comparisons in the Market**  
Other water filter brands like EveryDrop and Samsung have their merits, but I've personally found that LG sets itself apart with its emphasis on NSF certifications. While EveryDrop filters offer remarkable contaminant reduction, I found LG‚Äôs ability to maintain water flow and filtration consistency better in my setup. Samsung‚Äôs filters are equally praiseworthy but often come with a slightly higher price tag compared to this one, which is a point for LG in my book.

**Quality for Price**  
Let‚Äôs talk value. Yes, this filter isn‚Äôt the cheapest option out there, but it makes sense when you weigh the benefits against the cost. You‚Äôre not just buying a water filter‚Äîyou‚Äôre investing in cleaner water and peace of mind. For anyone like me, who drinks tap water daily and obsesses over their morning coffee, the consistent quality feels worth every penny. Spending that little extra for a product that truly delivers is a no-brainer.

Maybe we didn‚Äôt have the connections and resources to make it happen. Maybe we were too introverted or were bullied by jealous peers. Maybe we just didn‚Äôt want fame badly enough to try and tread water amongst the masses of honestly not-that-talented people desperate to be famous. 

‚ÄúIf I had your voice, I‚Äôd sing everywhere I went.‚Äù Really? Have you ever met one of those people? I actually have. And they‚Äôre supremely obnoxious. 

I would cry at night feeling cursed. I didn‚Äôt ask to be this gifted and then be hated- either by people who wanted it for themselves, or by those who perceived me as wasting my talent because I didn‚Äôt have the stomach to fight for fame. So I stopped singing. For over 20 years. 

At first it felt freeing, like I was taking my power back. But it slowly ate away at my soul not to make music. Songs began composing themselves in my head, whether I liked it or not, and usually at the most inconvenient times. Eventually the pain of suppressing it was too great, so I began to embrace it. For whatever reason, music insists on coming through me. 

Now I sing while performing sound baths and compose songs for fun. Eventually I might do some open mic nights and then perform at coffee shops or small parties. People ask me to record. Maybe someday. 

Not all musicians are cut out for the music industry, and that‚Äôs as it should be. It doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre somehow a failure. Maybe some of us are simply meant to share our gifts in small and unassuming ways. At a particular time. In a particular place. Amongst particular people. Maybe our music is meant to float away in the air- to be felt but never grasped- like in the days of our ancestors.

I‚Äôll be adding my particular comps to individual query letters when the time comes. ¬†

¬†

Dear \[Agent‚Äôs Name\],¬†

‚ÄúThe universe is a magic trick, and the Sapien Industrial Company has taken a look behind the curtain...‚Äù¬†

Brahm Ramsay is infamous for these words, and his company has made good on the claim: the Perpetuity Gardens can erase suffering‚Äîpermanently. His invention offers a new existence where death and pain no longer exist. Some in the galaxy call it salvation. To his aunt Margot, it‚Äôs heresy‚Äîand she dies trying to stop its release by contacting the Apeiron.¬†¬†

On the planet Erebus, Anemos lives in isolation, quietly grieving the death of his siblings and the collapse of his family. When he discovers Margot‚Äôs wrecked ship, he‚Äôs drawn from his mountain solitude by Occulith‚Äîa cryptic servant of the vanished Supernal Intelligence, the godlike force credited with resurrecting Earth and creating his people, the Apeiron.¬†¬†

As Brahm prepares to unveil the promise of eternity, rival powers vie to use Anemos to control their own narratives: for the dying Church, he is proof of divinity, and proof that the Perpetuity Gardens are an abomination; to Brahm, he is another symbol of abandonment. ¬†

But as Anemos is pulled deeper into the fractured affairs of mankind, a hidden truth begins to unravel: humanity‚Äôs resurrection came at a cost‚Äîand the entity that restored Earth may have been fleeing an older, far more dangerous enemy.¬†

THE SAPIEN CODA is a 100,000-word literary science fiction novel exploring grief, faith, and the limits of resurrection through multiple perspectives, mythic worldbuilding, and atmospheric prose. It is the first in a planned duology but stands alone as a complete narrative. This is my debut novel.¬†¬†

CHAPTER 1¬†

The Apostate‚ÄØ¬†

¬†

¬†¬†

The lights brightened in the Dominion Liner stateroom. The memory screen appeared, dimly lit with the insignia of the Sapien Industrial Company. Margot opened her eyes and looked at it for a few moments, wondering if the message was anything important.¬†¬†

The black sphere of the Earth rotated on the floating screen, interlocked in silver by a forgotten emblem of karma. She heard the voice of her nephew clearly in the cabin.¬†¬†

‚Äú...is a magic trick, and the Sapien Industrial Company has looked behind the curtain...‚Äù‚ÄØ‚ÄØ¬†

Margot looked away from the memory screen. She lowered the volume to near silence. *I have no desire to hear him pontificate this early.*¬†¬†

She slipped on shoes and wrapped herself in a thick robe. She insisted on making the bed every morning, although the ship could do that for her. Coffee and breakfast would be ready in the kitchen by the time she left the stateroom. However much Margot preferred handling life in the Dominion Liner manually, like making the bed and taking care of laundry, the luxury of a prepared coffee and breakfast were too convenient to sacrifice.¬†¬†

She would do away with the memory screens in a heartbeat, but they were integral to operating the ship.¬†¬†

She looked at it again, where Brahm Ramsay was addressing her personally. Her nephew was remarkably good looking. *He looks more confident than ever. And the confidence will disappear when the ship doesn‚Äôt return to the Orbital Facility. Shame I won‚Äôt be alive to see how everything falls apart around him.*¬†¬†

Thinking about her death did not bother her, but it did unleash a flood of adrenaline. Such thoughts were bold, and the adrenaline was detectable by the ship. She pushed it from her mind.¬†",1,1747839351.0,PubTips,4,0.67,False

Upon doing some inspecting the machine inside is coated with mould and I‚Äôm so upset. I am a very clean person and use all genuine JURA cleaning products when the machine asks. I clean and wipe down the machine after each use and never leave pucks or water in the drip tray. I‚Äôve also made sure to avoid oily beans to avoid clogging.

Called JURA and the CS spoke complete nonsense about how the machine can only be used on the coarsest setting ?? I mostly drink espresso and black coffee and from experience I know these require fine coarse setting. The CS agent straight up said I need to use the coarsest setting to avoid flyaway sticking to the inner components that causes mould.  So basically they‚Äôre telling me that having the option of changing the grind size is a complete dud as only the coarsest setting can be used. 

JURA have just roped me in, the machine cannot receive a proper clean unless it‚Äôs sent away and paid for by myself. 

I feel completely mislead and this was not explained anywhere. I‚Äôm still within the warranty period so JURA agreed to service it for free on this occasion. Does anyone know if I have a case to have it returned with a refund or should I raise a complaint / write to their head office?

I am seeking representation for my debut novel, ""Beyond Abandonment"", a psychological horror novel complete at 76,000 words. It will appeal to fans of The Only Good Indians by Stephen Graham Jones for its slow-burning dread rooted in ancestral guilt, and The Good House by Tananarive Due for its exploration of generational curses, grief, and supernatural legacies.

After years of foster care and living on the streets, Rylie O'Brien is handed the deed to her childhood home‚Äîthe one that was stolen from her. 

It‚Äôs a return to the life she was never allowed to have. 

Coming back means reuniting with Mia Becker again‚Äîthe best friend she was ripped from when her world collapsed. But it also means facing the truth that‚Äôs lived in her blood all along:

The O‚ÄôBrien family is cursed.

As the boundary between past and present begins to unravel, what destroyed the generations before her is stirring once more. Rylie bears the weight of a curse no one else survived, and if they can‚Äôt break the cycle, neither will she.

""Beyond Abandonment"" is a standalone novel with series potential. It centers queer love, inherited trauma, and feminine resilience, weaving folklore into a modern framework of psychological horror. Told in alternating perspectives and interspersed with diary entries from past generations, the novel explores the brutal cost of greed and the power of naming what haunts us.

As the author of two published interactive visual novels, I'm excited to introduce my debut novel, ""Beyond Abandonment,"" bringing my passion for storytelling to a new audience.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Name]


First 300 words:

I was four minutes from freedom when the caf√© door jingled‚Äîcheerful as hell, like it didn‚Äôt know I was already halfway clocked out.

In he walked‚ÄîBurberry scarf, designer loafers, and that particular brand of Upper West Side entitlement that always seemed to stick to the air. The wind howled outside, yanking the door shut behind him. My apron strings fluttered like they were ready to make a run for it. *Same.*

He took three steps in, lifted his chin, and just stared at the menu like it was the first time he‚Äôd ever seen the word *coffee*. I wanted to scream. Instead, I smiled. The kind of tight-lipped, customer-service smile that said: *the customer is always right*.

‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù I asked, forcing cheer through gritted teeth.

He didn‚Äôt look at me. ‚ÄúYeah, um‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the difference between a cappuccino and a latte again?‚Äù

I‚Äôd answered that question at least six hundred times. I hated coffee. Hated the smell, hated the taste, hated how people acted like it was sacred. I‚Äôd worked there long enough to fake the reverence, but I was running on four hours of sleep and one tepid cup of ramen. The filter was gone.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs foam,‚Äù I snapped. ‚ÄúOne‚Äôs foamier. That‚Äôs the whole mystery.‚Äù

He stared at me like I‚Äôd just kicked his designer dog. ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

My stomach sank. *Shit. I fucked up.*

‚ÄúI don't think I like your tone,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to speak to your manager.‚Äù

I inhaled through my nose so sharply it felt like I was snorting the bitterness out of the air. My fingers clenched the edge of the counter. I pivoted, marched to the back, and found Jordan wiping down the milk steamer with that same slow, methodical calm that had always made me feel like screaming.

I‚Äôm 20, and so is my best friend, let‚Äôs call her C. We‚Äôve been inseparable since kindergarten. For years, she was the one person I never had to worry about losing. Our friendship always felt unshakable, like it was meant to be.

In 2023, C went on a trip to Lourdes with her employer and became Catholic. I was fully supportive, asked her questions, joined her at Church occasionally, and genuinely wanted to understand. Everything seemed fine between us. We kept seeing each other nearly every day and we both reaffirmed clearly that we‚Äôre lucky to have each other and that we just loved our bond. (Good memories)

Unfortunately (lol) we became adults, I moved two hours away to live with my boyfriend, and seeing her became harder. Our schedules clashed, and I could only manage short visits every couple of weeks. I also missed her Baptism due to a planned trip, which I still feel awful about even though she said it was okay. I feel bad generally because we see each other less often but I always keep her in mind and let her know that.

Since then, things changed. She started replying less and less. I kept checking in, sending memes or messages like ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhen can we get coffee together‚Äù ofc.

Meanwhile, she‚Äôs been posting on social media about how God is her best friend now, praying for people ‚Äúnot sent by Him‚Äù to leave her life, and reposting increasingly intense religious content. I‚Äôm starting to wonder does she think I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúsent by God‚Äù? Is this her way of saying goodbye?

I‚Äôm heartbroken and confused. I called and let her know how I feel, but I‚Äôve been met with silence. I want to respect her faith, but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve somehow become someone she believes she needs to distance from. I‚Äôm worried about her and I have received no explanation from her.

1krzfy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetmePetSitting/comments/1krzfy6/how_much_can_you_charge_as_a_pet_sitter/,How much can you charge as a pet sitter?,"If you‚Äôre a pet sitter (or thinking about becoming one), one of the biggest questions is: how much can you actually charge? I‚Äôve been sitting for a few years now, and I‚Äôve learned a thing or two about setting rates that are fair but also help you make a decent living. It‚Äôs tricky to figure out what‚Äôs right‚Äîcharge too little, and you‚Äôre selling yourself short; charge too much, and you might scare off clients. Let‚Äôs break down the factors to consider and some ballpark numbers to get you started. Grab a coffee (it‚Äôs a bit after 5 PM where I am, perfect time for a break!), and let‚Äôs talk rates!

# 1. Check what‚Äôs normal in your area

Your location plays a huge role in what you can charge‚Äîrates in a big city are usually way higher than in a small town.

* **do some research**: Look at what other sitters in your area are charging. You can poke around online or even ask friends what they pay for pet sitting. In my city, drop-ins usually go for $15-25 for 30 minutes, but in a pricier spot like downtown, I‚Äôve seen $30-40.
* **factor in cost of living**: If you‚Äôre in a place where rent and gas are expensive, you can charge more to cover your costs. In a cheaper area, you might need to keep rates lower to stay competitive.
* **think about demand**: If there aren‚Äôt many sitters where you are, you can probably charge a bit more since clients don‚Äôt have a ton of options.

# 2. Base it on the services you offer

What you‚Äôre doing for the pet makes a big difference in what you can charge. Not all gigs are created equal!

* **drop-ins**: These are quick visits‚Äîlike 20-30 minutes to feed, walk, or play. They‚Äôre usually the cheapest, maybe $15-30 per visit depending on your area.
* **walks**: If you‚Äôre just taking a dog for a 30-minute walk, you might charge $15-25. Longer walks or ones with extra stuff (like picking up poop or dealing with a puller) can go higher, maybe $25-35.
* **overnight stays**: These are the big bucks because you‚Äôre staying at the owner‚Äôs place all night. I‚Äôve seen rates from $50-100 per night‚Äîmore if you‚Äôre also doing walks or other care during the day.
* **boarding**: If the pet‚Äôs staying at your place, you can charge $40-80 per night. It‚Äôs more work (and risk) since they‚Äôre in your space, so don‚Äôt undersell yourself.
* **special care**: Got skills like giving meds, handling special-needs pets, or doing basic grooming? Add $5-10 per visit or day. Owners will pay extra for someone who can handle their diabetic cat or anxious pup.

# 3. Factor in your experience

How long you‚Äôve been doing this‚Äîand how good you are at it‚Äîmatters a ton.

* **newbie sitters**: If you‚Äôre just starting out, you might need to charge on the lower end to get clients‚Äîlike $15 for a drop-in or $40 for an overnight (but still depending on your area, charge a bit less that what people around you are charging basically). Build up some reviews first.
* **experienced sitters**: Once you‚Äôve got a year or two under your belt and some happy clients, bump your rates. I started at $15 for walks but now charge $25 because I‚Äôve got a solid clientelle.
* **special training**: If you‚Äôve got certifications‚Äîlike pet first aid or dog training‚Äîyou can charge more. Mention it in your profile and add $5-10 to your usual rate.

# 4. Don‚Äôt forget the extras

There are other things that can bump up your rates‚Äîor make you adjust them down:

* **holidays**: Around busy times like Christmas or summer vacations, you can charge more‚Äîlike 20% extra. Everyone‚Äôs looking for a sitter, so you‚Äôre in demand.
* **multiple pets**: If you‚Äôre watching more than one pet, add a small fee‚Äîlike $5-10 per extra pet. It‚Äôs more work, so you should get paid for it.
* **travel time**: If you‚Äôre driving a long way to get to the gig, factor that in. Some sitters add a $5-10 travel fee for anything over 30 minutes.
* **last-minute bookings**: If someone books you with less than 24 hours‚Äô notice, you can charge a rush fee‚Äîmaybe 10-20% more. It‚Äôs a hassle to rearrange your schedule, so make it worth your time.

# Finally - start fair, then adjust as you go

When you‚Äôre setting your rates, aim for something that feels fair for your area, services, and experience‚Äîbut don‚Äôt be afraid to tweak it over time. I started low to get my first few clients, then raised my rates once I had some good reviews and felt more confident. Also, talk to clients‚Äîif they‚Äôre happy to pay what you‚Äôre charging without blinking, you might be able to go a bit higher next time.

A rough starting point for most places: $15-25 for a 30-minute drop-in, $20-35 for a 30-minute walk, $50-80 for an overnight. But always check what‚Äôs normal where you are‚Äîdon‚Äôt just copy my numbers!

i saw one when that boy chose his family over her. over religion? she told me the dad doesn‚Äôt want him marrying christian. i asked her if he would choose her. she could not answer me until he did. since then her eyes started greying out. 

it‚Äôs why you sometimes feel bad vibes in certain places. 

because pain lingers. absence leaves fingerprints. when people lie, cry, betray or break in a space, the energy doesn‚Äôt vanish. it settles. it seeps into the walls, into the silence, into the air between breaths.

ever walked into a room and felt tension without a word spoken? that‚Äôs not your imagination. that‚Äôs your instinct of familiarity.

some places feel like ghosts live there, but it‚Äôs not the dead. it‚Äôs the unfelt. the unforgiven. the unloved.
it‚Äôs the weight of what was never healed.

and sometimes, it‚Äôs not the room that‚Äôs haunted. it‚Äôs the person. walking memories. carrying betrayals. 

it‚Äôs why when gang members beat me up for stealing drugs they were impressed that i wasn‚Äôt showing any signs of pain. it‚Äôs just physical pain though? it‚Äôs nothing compared to what i saw in hell.

i will die thrice times. once when i leave space time. again when someone says my name last. lastly when someone thinks about me last. i hope i live up to my name.

i know how i saw the ghosts. it‚Äôs because i do not tie a person to their physical bodies. it‚Äôs why when my mum died, i was not sad. she lives with me in memory of her kisses when i did well in school. but only when i did well. she taught me about Love and i Love my mother regardless and unconditionally.

redacted.

inside the shadow of ego. it‚Äôs a prison unlike any other. 

do not forget what you say in hell. the lesson will repeat itself until learned.

you speak lies in hell. your trauma speaks in lies. just watch death whisperer. she died because the sister lied. they saw a ghost and when the little girl asked the big sister if she saw the ghost: no i didn‚Äôt see anything. and the little girl gets possessed by the ghost. 

it‚Äôs one of the most accurate portrayal of death manifest. it was the dark thing that appeared to Eve in heaven. death is the opposite of Life the same way it is the opposite of Love. if you‚Äôre dead, you can‚Äôt Love yourself anymore. 

when you lie you rob yourself from heaven. i know because once i stopped lying to myself, i was set free. from all negativity. i could no longer experience negative emotions. 


drugs make you feel like you‚Äôre doing important things but in reality you‚Äôre living with your mother at 30. he

drugs make you feel like you‚Äôre doing important things but in reality you‚Äôre living with your mother at 30. he

that was the lie adam said to Eve. he said in heaven that he loved her but in reality , he loved heaven more.

he liked money and hoes. he liked the female attention. he liked doing drugs. everything which exists is drugs because they all get you high on validation. on approval, on a fake sense of worth.

redacted 

. liked all the fake Love cause there was nothing out there but fake love. money. stuff. material items in excess. it‚Äôs one of the sins of ego. gluttony and greed are humanity‚Äôs biggest sin. in parallel universe, all food is free. we do not fight for survival. we keep our garden flora and fauna clean. because we respect each other as we do ourselves.

 real Love is doesn‚Äôt exist in illusions within us. it‚Äôs within how we treat each other. 

you‚Äôll just feel like something doesn‚Äôt smell right. like there‚Äôs always something missing in life. like incomplete. when i was in hell i felt it. i know what i saw and i can‚Äôt unsee it. hell is not as it was written. it is worse. 

i said it before :  their actions don't define you. your response does. when you forgive, you reclaim your power. you align yourself with Love, not because they deserve it, but because you deserve peace.
true Love doesn't wait for apologies. it moves beyond wounds.

and i have a wonder woman poster in my room. i‚Äôve met wonder women before. there‚Äôs one at work. she still smiles at me despite what she saw in hell. she was gone for a bit and when i found out what happened, my heart fell. i didn‚Äôt feel pity. i felt a deep sense of admiration for her. truly women around me all teacht me about Love. 

i know what happened last night. i do not believe you  . i know because i know what ego is. you said it as if you‚Äôve been rejected before. and i know you‚Äôve been selling your soul to lies. it does not end well.

when she told me she didn‚Äôt remember how she made me feel. i reminded her of when she told me to fuck off and die just for being born. she didn‚Äôt see the damage she did to me. it‚Äôs why my friends ask me what‚Äôs the point of telling who hurt you of how they did so. 

that‚Äôs the problem with you addicts of ego. do not tell them the truth because of their reaction. tell the truth because you are not a liar. 

when i was set free from the thought prison i put myself in, i could no longer feel negative emotions.

she didn‚Äôt need to remember. she just needed to hear the truth from me because she deserved it.

in time yall addicts will see what happens after the threshold hits. yall will learn the truth of existence. and by then your existence will be unable to stabilise in heaven. do not underestimate my goddess. she rebalances all in time. 

i did not clean my room when she slept over. i made it such that she would see me in my worst physical state. the same day i cleaned my room was the day she blocked me and deleted her ig account. talk about spring cleaning huh. 

maybe she was judging me but since i was more interested at looking in her eyes, i must have forgot to read her with my ego. 

i said it before :   good men allow themselves to get manipulated. they do not believe women are like what they hear about. 

i was merely showing her my duality. she keeps clean because her life is chaotic. i just got off a bender with my bro so i was realigning myself. ego needed time to readjust in my singularity.

i didnot clean my room when she slept over.

but same day i cleaned it,
she blocked me and deleted her ig account.
spring cleaning

a sign of being dead inside is where none of your friends have pictures of you which are not on social media.

no i do not want her back. i want her to be happy as how she defines it. i want her to find someone who will treat her with all the love she deserved for me. -

maybe she was judging me.
but i focused on looking into her eyes
so much i forgot
to remember to read her with my ego.

i said it before:
good men allow themselves to be manipulated.
they don‚Äôt believe women are what the world says they are.

i know you are a lie because you act as if everyone who ever spoke with you did only because you‚Äôre good looking. you know that under that mask, you are nothing compared to me. you have no identity. you are merely what you are told you are. 

why? because it‚Äôs always easy to blame someone for the shit you did. i stole souls for a living back when i was in pain. i had to steal her back.

i wasn‚Äôt hiding anything.
i was showing her my duality.
she keeps clean because her life‚Äôs chaotic.
she said she pays for maid to clean the room weekly. extreme ocd the full spectrum.

i had just come off a bender with my brother.
i was realigning.
my ego needed time to readjust into my singularity.

one time i asked myself if who i identify as myself is merely an act of compensation for who i was when i stole souls. my ego said yes because women made me believe i am unlovable. 

i however declined to answer this question. i am many things but i am not Man enough to answer this. i do not know everything and i humbled myself again this time.

so far no man has ever tried to fight me. the scar on my face is proof of that. since that day, i have been protected. 

since that day where i was shown a choice between being myself or being another, i chose Love. 

i saw death‚Äôs shadow multiple times be it via od, situations with unstable people or on the road but i did not pass the threshold more than how i did previously. 

happy birthday new friend. i honour the day you as Love chose to enter this world through you. may this year bring you closer to who you truly are.

and for me, birthdays are not about the past or the future. i merely am grateful i am able to Love myself, others and all things as myself. 

i do not tie myself to many space time concepts because i do not like to be imprisoned. still i must respect laws as they govern the physicality of most people. 

so my friends, think about what you did today. did you Love yourself in thought, word and action? if not, you might need alignment.

i missed quite a few chances where i could have been myself but i held myself back. i thought it would be rude if i told her i found her confidence in holding her coffee by the lid was interesting. intention matters and so does understanding someone‚Äôs peace. 

don‚Äôt apologise for being what you are. don‚Äôt say sorry to me for making a mistake. we make those. we want to learn through them. we incarnated ourselves because we wanted to learn about Love. even in the tiny things, systems etc merely prove our will and details. if god is in the details then so are we.  

there exists a system that works out there. it‚Äôs the only location in space time which time does not exist. in a realm of reactivity where the observed influences the reality. that is what heaven feels like. 

the issue is, it is limited by space still hence it‚Äôs not true heaven. imagine a location where the restrictions of space time are null. if you wanted a house now, you‚Äôd have to build it. if you wanted to eat you have to hunt down. in heaven there is no wants and desires because everything already is.

here we are limited by the laws of physics which govern all outside our perspective. we live in hell because all the demons are here. they exist in all the senses. i like the sound medium. demons exist as lies here. 

i said it before : your trauma speaks in lies.

here we are limited by ego. it is our desire to have fake love. 

in heaven in our garden on Love on sunday,

we know that we already have everything. we do not chase. we merely manifest. and we do so with Love. 
those who stop believing in themselves as Love who have the power to manifest Love will be in hell forever. do not underestimate my goddess. she rebalances all in time. and you are not immune to her because she is your true self in heaven waiting for you to come home. 

come home the right way this time.

If you have toddlers you know how hard it is to keep the house clean and I feel like I am just constantly cleaning. I just started to question how I act when she makes messes because of a video my MIL sent me. She keeps her for a few days at a time, fairly often, at least once a month. She sent me a video of Sarah in a high chair with a pot of dry rice just like slinging it around and laughing hysterically. She definitely was having fun and seemed to really enjoy it, plus her grandmother was laughing right along with her. All I could think was ‚Äúyeah that‚Äôs not how that would go if she were home lol‚Äù. So now I‚Äôm wondering does she come home and wonder why she can‚Äôt do stuff like that here?? She sometimes will play with her food or sling it around like any toddler but I try not to encourage it, I always tell her ‚Äúno, don‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôs not nice to make messes‚Äù, or something along those lines. Sometimes I just can‚Äôt help myself I‚Äôll say ‚Äúwhy?!‚Äù So now she will make a mess and go ‚Äúwhy?!‚Äù lol. I never like yell at her but I am definitely not like laughing or encouraging it. Sometimes I do feel like she needs more sensory play, which is often messy, so I‚Äôll pull out the kinetic sand or once I got her some paint and little wood things from the dollar tree to paint‚Ä¶we will NOT do that again in the house for at least a year lol it was a HUGE mess, but maybe it will go better when she‚Äôs a little older. It‚Äôs definitely easier as it gets warmer to do ‚Äúmessy‚Äù activities because we can go outside, but it‚Äôs like a once or twice a week thing. I also take her to the park like every other day to get some energy out and just get out of the house. I feel like when she goes to my MILs she lets Sarah just do whatever she wants, including slinging food, dumping the cat bowls, playing in bowls of water in the kitchen floor. Just about anything is on the table. It just makes me wonder if I‚Äôm wrong, if I should just accept the messes because she LOVES doing stuff like that. But then I also think, well if we go to someone‚Äôs house or something I don‚Äôt want her to think it‚Äôs okay to go in their kitchen and dump out their cereal or what have you. Should I be letting her do these things because she‚Äôs basically a baby? Or am I right to discourage it?!

1krz7am,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpeerMethod/comments/1krz7am/unlock_your_approach_confidence_tips_for/,Unlock Your Approach Confidence: Tips for Authentic Openings!,"Hey everyone,

Let's talk about the ""approach""‚Äîthat initial moment of breaking the ice that can feel like the biggest hurdle for many. Forget canned lines and uncomfortable routines. At Speer Method, we believe the most powerful approach comes from authenticity, respect, and genuine curiosity.

Here are a few tips to help you make those first moments count and open the door to real connection:

1. **Lead with Curiosity, Not an Agenda:** Your goal isn't to ""get"" something, but to genuinely meet someone new. When you're authentically curious, your questions become natural and your energy inviting. Think: ""What makes this person interesting?"" instead of ""What can I say to impress?""
2. **Use Situational Openers:** The easiest way to break the ice is to comment on something in your shared environment. It‚Äôs low-pressure, natural, and demonstrates awareness.
   * *Example:* ""This coffee shop is always so busy on Tuesdays, isn't it? What brings you here?"" (at a cafe)
   * *Example:* ""That band has a great vibe tonight, have you seen them before?"" (at a concert)
3. **Read the Room (and Their Cues):** Before you even open your mouth, observe. Is the person deeply engaged in something? Do they have headphones on? Look for open body language (uncrossed arms, facing outwards, eye contact) as an invitation. If you see closed cues, respect that.
4. **Keep it Low-Pressure:** Your first sentence just needs to get a response. It doesn't need to be brilliant or witty. A simple, warm ""Hi, how are you?"" can be more effective than a complicated ""opener"" if delivered with genuine friendliness.
5. **Focus on Your Vibe:** Your non-verbal communication speaks volumes. A genuine smile, open body language, and a relaxed demeanor signal confidence and approachability. Your energy is contagious!
6. **Respect Their Choice:** If someone isn't receptive, that's okay. A polite ""No problem, have a great day!"" and gracefully moving on shows maturity and respect, which are attractive qualities in themselves. Not everyone will be a match, and that's perfectly normal.

The art of the approach is a skill, and like any skill, it improves with practice. Focus on being present, authentic, and respectful, and you'll find those initial interactions becoming much smoother and more enjoyable.

I had a loud HVAC compressor and struggled to understand if it was normal or abnormal. The deciding factor for me on whether to request service was additional vibration and a grinding noise in the cabin. 

Not so great: I initially reported the issue in early March and couldn't get an appointment until May 15. It wasn't an urgent issue so I was OK with waiting. 

Communication just before the appointment was good, I appreciated the reminders. Drop off was good, decent coffee, and once the service advisor conferred with a tech he informed me they would plan to just replace the HVAC compressor. They would keep the car a few days. I also asked for a tire rotation. 

They set me up with an Enterprise rental - a BMW i4 (I said I didn't need a SUV). Enterprise delivered the car to the service center. 

Another not so good: dropped the car on Friday and they said to be done on Monday. No one contacted me Monday. I was busy with work and kids so didn't push or investigate. I finally looked in the app Tuesday afternoon and saw it was finished, so I reached out. 

At pickup the service advisor informed me that they found metal shavings in the compressor and replaced it. They also did a proactive replacement of the 12V battery!

The other surprise and and delight piece was that they hand washed the car!

1krz058,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/1krz058/my_experience_with_donquijote_language_school_in/,My experience with DonQuijote language school in Madrid and Salamanca,"I have posted here earlier in the year asking people for their advice/to share their experiences with DonQuijote language school and have finally decided to post my summary of my experience now that I have studied at both schools! A few people have gotten in touch asking me to post something similar so I hope below will be helpful to some people to make up their minds. Feel free to dm me/comment here with more questions, it is very likely that I have forgotten to cover something. Also,[ this is a link to that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/1hv1w54/has_anyone_recently_attended_a_spanish_language/) that has some background info regarding my Spanish study background etc and some questions/doubts I had then.

**The core info**

* I spent 4 weeks studying in Salamanca and 3 weeks studying in Madrid (in that order). I opted for the Intensive Spanish 25 course, which meant 5 hours of studying per every single weekday.
* Based on my online level test before arriving and during the short oral ‚Äòtest‚Äô (more like a conversation) on the day of my first class, I was assigned to B2 classes. In Madrid I leveled up to C1 as I had completed the majority of the B2 course in Salamanca/felt kind of ready for that level.
* I arranged my accommodation through the school, as I wanted to practice my Spanish with other students at the school. I am in my late twenties so student halls or living with a host family really didn‚Äôt appeal to me, but if anyone has questions re that I had spoken to a lot of students from both schools who have had mixed experiences with that and can comment on that if you so wish.
* I trust that you have looked at their website and have seen photos/videos/read course information, so I won‚Äôt bother with information that's ‚Äòout there‚Äô already.

**Overall/the course:**

* I really enjoyed my time with the school. I felt that the teachers were really qualified and caring and often went above and beyond during the lessons to ensure that students truly understood the content they were teaching. The only issue I had with the school is with their accommodation, regarding which their communication was pretty bad.
* Studying there has covered some of the gaps I felt I had re grammar and strengthened my listening and speaking skills. I truly do recommend the school and the overall experience of studying abroad; it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôll also have a great time at other schools within those same cities in Spain, but I chose DQ based on reputation and abundance of information they have on their websites, which other schools do not have.
* The conversation classes especially were a lot of fun and I felt that most of my learning happened. Strangely they weren‚Äôt popular in Madrid - there was mainly one other student for most of them and I had to have a few lessons without any other student there, but maybe that was due to low student numbers during the off-peak season (March).
* There was a mix of ages across both schools - I specifically chose February and March to avoid the gap-year crowd (and managed to do so) but was still surprised at the amount of early 20-somethings studying there. I would say the average age of students in Salamanca was 23-25 and in Madrid around 30-35, but the latter ‚Äòstatistic‚Äô was skewed by the fact that only ‚Äòolder‚Äô professionals were taking C1 classes.¬†

**Top Tips:**

* The book you are kind of obliged to buy wasn‚Äôt followed very often, especially at C1 level; a trick I learned too late (and from long-term students at the school) is to opt out from purchasing the book at the school when you arrive and instead get the Nuevo Prismo books, which are much cheaper and are exact same that the school uses, but the DQ ones have different covers.
* There's also Nuevo Prisma Libro de Ejercicios, which is better to buy for self-study, as you can‚Äôt fully use the other books for self-study as they‚Äôre meant to be used in class environments.
* Book accommodation (and the course) early and really spell out what you want re accommodation early to avoid being disappointed. And I mean really painfully spell it out what you want... More on that below.
* If you‚Äôre interested, you can DM me and I can give you a referral code the school offers. I can't quite remember what the discount is, but I swear I remember reading about it in one of their emails they sent me or at some point when I was paying for everything (am typing this up on a train with poor wifi).

**Salamanca**  
The school

* It is tiny, but I only see this as a positive. I felt like I really got to know the teachers and students not only in my level, but in other levels too. There is a cafe next door which you could enter through the school's courtyard - being able to go in and get a coffee or a bite to eat during the break and finding more or less the entire school there was something I really missed when I moved to Madrid. It is bang on in the center of the city so I felt like I was close to everything, which was very convenient.
* The school offered a trip of 2 per week, which for some reason most students didn't know about - the information would be displayed at the entrance of the school. This was usually a guided walk in the city somewhere with a tutor and then a paid excursion outside of the city. Madrid school also offered this, but at the time I was there the trips were more boring/centered on free museums and galleries. 

The accommodation

* I lucked out and was assigned a flat more or less next door to the school, which meant that my morning commute was about 30 seconds. The flat was very, very basic and there were some issues with it which the school helped to fix; you have to bring up any issues with the flat or the course with the admin team (in the reception at the entrance to the school) and they would react immediately.¬†
* I lived with 2 other students. Their Spanish level was lower than mine, which made it hard to actually practice Spanish together - I encouraged it, but I think they felt a little demotivated to reciprocate, so we did speak English most of the time.¬†
* The school seems to place people of the same nationality in the same flat - for example, there was a lot of Dutch students who were all placed in the same flat and this didn‚Äôt seem like a coincidence.¬†

The city  
It is a beautiful, historic university town with a pretty lively nightlife. You can really get to know it pretty quickly and take your time visiting different tourist spots. I felt strangely at home in it, maybe because it reminded me of cities like Cambridge in England, in which I have spent a lot of time in. However, towards the end of 4 weeks I did feel like I had seen and done everything, which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing, but there‚Äôs only so much you can do there before being tempted to get a train or a coach for the weekend to visit a different city/town.

**Madrid**  
The school

* Significantly bigger than Salamanca and more modern. It was pretty quiet when I studied there in March, but I heard from the teachers that it gets very busy in late spring and even more so in summer.
* The overall vibe felt a little colder than in Salamanca; the teachers and the students seemed more distant. I guess it's because Salamanca school was smaller and I expected this, but it still shook me a little. 
* Every single teacher was late for every single lesson. The stereotype was stereotyping hard.

The accommodation

* Pretty bad. I had wanted to live in a shared student flat, like I did in Salamanca, and was led to believe this up until a week before moving there. I received an email saying I‚Äôll basically be living in a student hall of residence with like 13 rooms/close to 30 students (still for DQ students) as there wasn‚Äôt a type of room I specifically wanted. They never explained to me why they didn‚Äôt let me know months and months ago when I booked and paid for everything that this was the case - if I would have known I would have sorted out a place to stay by myself outside of the school.
* The flat wasn‚Äôt too bad but it wasn‚Äôt great and did ruin my experience. It was basically empty, there were a few other students there who couldn‚Äôt communicate well in English or Spanish. The cleaning personnel seemed to be living on site and would evade questions whether they didnt or didn‚Äôt. The facilities were terribly outdated and I felt scammed. It was just weird.¬†

The city  
No point in writing much here as we all know that it has a lot to offer. It felt special to be able to live and study here for 3 weeks.¬†

Well I have very very good news!! Before I start before you slam on my mother PLEASE look at all of my posts about this BEFORE you make a judgment. I understand you're trying to help but a lot of your posts were upsetting to me.

This is just a small snippet of my life and a mistake that was made years ago that can't be changed. My mom has gotten better over the years and has been my rock through very tough times.

That being said, here is the final update. We woke up pretty early this morning around 7:30 am. And got ready. As far as we knew he was going to be ar breakfast.

So, I told her I'd rather go to Starbucks for my breakfast instead. She said ok that is fine. So we went our seprate ways. My mom, aunt N. Cousin M, and Uncle V2 went to meet with the others.

(This was MY choice to have breakfast by myself. Please don't slam my mom for not going with me. I wanted her to be with her family as it meant more to me to spend as much time as possible. As they're up in age and we don't know how long any of us have. We dont know what tomorrow holds.)

Anyways, I went to Starbucks ordered my coffee. They didn't have much food wise, so I just got a large coffee.

Then as I was waiting my mom texted me. ""Hey he isn't coming why don't you come over and have breakfast with us."" I was like sure, lemme get my coffee and I'll meet you there.

I got my coffee and headed to the restaurant. When I got there all eho was there was my mom, aunt N, uncle V, uncle V2 and cousin M.

Aunt C stayed home as she wasn't feeling well (which didn't bother me at all. It made it better that she wasn't there)

I sat down and were talking and having a good time! It was nice seeing everyone getting alone and being happy and laughing. Acting like siblings should!

The food was good. And we talked (well they did me and my cousin M just listened lol we don't talk much.)

Then once we finished we took some family pictures of everyone together and said our goodbyes went our seprate ways. Mom and I went to Walmart to shop for the nieces Easter and birthday gifts and headed home.

We just got home about an hour ago and I smothered my 3 kitties in hugs and kisses I missed them so much! I'm glad to be home and glad God is so good and that our family bonds are in the process of healing! Praise God!

Thank you all for reading my story and those who had helpful advice. I want to state no one is perfect. And people screw up especially parents and family.

Even tho I wasn't able to face my fear, I might be able down the road with some heavy therapy once we can afford it.

What happened this weekend/week reminds me of Disney's Brave. The line; ""Fate be changed. Look inside. Mend the bond torn by pride."" Which has a lot of truth in it!

And my mom and her siblings are living proof of that. There was pride and anger and hatred that had shattered them for over 30 years. And now they've put aside their pride and are now on the road to healing.

I'm glad to have been there to see most of it. Anyways in rambling. Thanks for reading!

TLDR: Mom and her siblings went to breakfast turns out the cousin this post has been about didn't come. I went to breakfast and saw thay they were acting like a family again!

Had some fun stories from their past, family pictures and we parted ways and went home. So far a happy ending! Thanks for reading and I hope you all have a wonderful year.",1,1747837150.0,MarkNarrations,0,1.0,False
1kryzq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warehouseworkers/comments/1kryzq3/is_this_how_it_will_always_be/,Is this how it will always be?,"I've had issues with two coworkers for over a year, I kept asking them nicely to do things the way I need them to(per my boss). They wouldn't, I put in a complaint. Of course it got work because I'm the devil for complaining that I don't know how to make something work. They made it worse for me and I had a mental breakdown because of it (outside of work). I'm a nice person, I give out candy and food and coffee. Whenever they ask anything of me I do it right then and there even if I'm busy. They on the other hand talk shit about me for complaining about them months ago everyday multiple times a day and I am going crazy. Is this it? Is there no getting them to just stop doing it around me? Like everyday I just hear dumb shit about me or they act like I'm being a b because I said ""I didn't know I wasn't told"" they flew their hands up and were like ""oh I don't want to start anything"" but I was just saying I DONT KNOW.

That was ChronoSend for me. This little start-up, ""Temporal Solutions,"" claimed they'd cracked it ‚Äì sending emails to the past. Beta testers needed. I, being a technology reporter with a morbid curiosity, wangled my way in.

The interface looked like any old email client, just with a ""Target Date"" field. My wife, Sarah‚Ä¶ she died three years ago. Car crash. A drunk driver went through a red light at the junction of Oxford Road and Station Lane. 17th May, 8:03 pm. I still see it in my nightmares.

So, I typed:

Target Date: 17th May, 2022, 7:00 pm  
Subject: URGENT ‚Äì AVOID DRIVING TONIGHT

""Mark, this is you. Future you. Sounds insane, I know. But please, for the love of God, do NOT let Sarah drive tonight. Don't go out. Stay home. Avoid Oxford Road and Station Lane at all costs. Just trust me. Please.""

I hit send. My heart was a jackhammer. Nothing happened, obviously. Not in my present.

A week later, I'm making coffee, and Sarah walks into the kitchen.  
Sarah. Alive. Smiling. Complaining about the price of avocados.

I dropped the mug. She rushed over, ""Mark! Are you alright? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

""Sarah?"" My voice was a croak.

""Yeah, silly. Who else?"" She kissed my cheek. It felt like waking from a dream you never wanted to end. Her lips were warm, real. I could smell her shampoo‚Äîlavender and citrus. I just stared, afraid she'd vanish.

But she didn't.

The world felt‚Ä¶ off, though. My phone had a case I didn't remember. The coffee maker was different. A photo showed us at Niagara Falls‚Äîa trip we'd never taken, at least not in my memory.

Sarah was alive. That should have been enough. But the reporter in me couldn't let it go. I checked the news archives for 17th May, 2022, bracing myself for the headline about the fatal crash at Oxford Road and Station Lane. It was gone. In its place: ""Local Couple Win Pub Quiz Championship."" My heart thudded. What else had changed?

My inbox was full of emails about a promotion I didn't remember. My editor congratulated me on an expos√© I'd never written.

That night, I lay awake, watching Sarah breathe, feeling both gratitude and unease. I'd saved her, but at what cost? What else had changed?

The next morning, I found a new email in my Sent folder. It wasn't from me. Not exactly.

""Mark, this is you. Future you. Sounds insane, I know. But please, for the love of God, do NOT send any more emails to the past. Avoid the temptation. Don't ask questions. Don't try to fix anything else. Just live. Trust me. Please.""

I stared at the screen as Sarah called from the kitchen, ""Mark, do you want some tea and toast?""

I closed the laptop. I walked to the kitchen. I hugged her, tighter than ever before.

Maybe some second chances are meant to be lived, not questioned.",5,1747836960.0,scarystories,1,0.86,False
