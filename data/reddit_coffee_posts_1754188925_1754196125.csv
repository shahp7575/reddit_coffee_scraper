He never psychically beat me, only yell and scream and I was scared of him so every time he got mad I would drug him. Usually he got tired and went to sleep but sometimes he didn't. I would also do it if he was going to help me with my homework which I hadn't done so he would be to tired to look over my homework and just go to bed.

**Parse the Odds: A Statistical Tango of Near-Equality**  
The KBO‚Äôs Doosan Bears (vs. SSG Landers) is a statistical chess match where both teams have the mathematical precision of a spreadsheet and the chaos of a toddler in a candy store. The moneyline is locked at **1.91 for both teams**, implying a 52.3% implied probability for each‚Äîa toss-up if ever there was one. The spread tells a slightly different story: SSG is favored by 1.5 runs at most books, but the odds (ranging from **-150 to -157**) suggest bookmakers think SSG‚Äôs edge is more of a ‚Äúgentle nudge‚Äù than a knockout punch. Meanwhile, the total runs line sits at **9.0**, with ‚ÄúOver‚Äù priced at 1.95-1.98 and ‚ÄúUnder‚Äù at 1.8-1.85. In simpler terms, this game is expected to be as explosive as a pi√±ata at a fireworks factory.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Quirks, and the Eternal Struggle of Pitchers**  
Recent updates from the KBO frontlines? Let‚Äôs dive in:

* **SSG Landers**: Their ace, **Jung Min-ho**, has been throwing so consistently it‚Äôs rumored he sets his pre-pitch routine to a metronome. However, his backup catcher recently admitted he‚Äôs been ‚Äúchasing sunsets‚Äù during warmups, which might explain why three wild pitches hit the backstop last week.
* **Doosan Bears**: Their slugger, **Kim Tae-an**, is nursing a ‚Äúbean-related injury‚Äù after a post-game incident where he tried to shatter a record for most home runs *and* most beanbags thrown in a single season. (Spoiler: He failed, but the hospital stay was free.) Meanwhile, their bullpen‚Äôs collective ERA is 4.85‚Äîabout the same as a coffee machine‚Äôs chances of winning a marathon.

Kumakaen kami ng anak ko (3 yrs old). Bata pa at napalikot kaya nabagsak at nabasag nya ang coffee mug ko.

Pagkalinis ko, maya-maya lang may unknown number na nagtext saken, nangutang at hindi daw marunong magbayad ang asawa ko (M29).

Sinend ko sa asawa ko ang text at pagkauwi nya sa bahay kinausap ko sya saan sya umutang at magkano. 

Sa ONLINE LENDING APP daw. 
Pinakita nya saken ung app, ang dami nyang loan sa isang app. Hindi bababa sa lima ang loan nya dun na nasa 2K-9K per loan.

Ang hindi ko inaasahan. Hindi lang pala isa.
Hindi lang pala sa isang lending app sya may utang. Madami. Madami pa kong online lending app sa cellphone nya, at lahat ng yun may loan sya. Sumatotal, umabot ng hindi bababa ng 75K lahat. Lahat halos due date na. Kaya naman pala din ang daming tumatawag sa kanya na unknown number, yun pala maniningil yun ng utang.

BINAYARAN KO YUN LAHAT. Ang inipon ipon ko ng ilang taon, nawala na parang bula. Ako na hindi ugali mangutang ay umutang para may pangbayad sa utang na hindi naman ako ang nakinabang (Nabayaran ko naman din yung inutang ko. Thank you Lord!)

Ang asawa ko walang trabaho, sya ang nasa bahay para magalaga sa anak namin. Since saming dalawa ako mas may ok ang kita sa work. Pero may maliit na online business na sya nagaasikaso, na galing din saken ang initial puhunan, para nga kahit papano hindi sya maburyo sa bahay.

Tinanong ko sya, san nya ginamit? Ang sabi nya sa business. - Ok. business. Pero wala naman akong nakikitang positive movement sa business, at wala din naman sya nabibigay dito sa bahay. 

So ok na yun. Solved na since nabayaran ko na lahat ng utang nya at pinag uninstall na lahat ng lending app sa phone nya. At ang plano babayaran nya nalang daw ako. Nagusap kami at nagstart na din sya magwork as rider. Hindi nadin naman ganun kabantayin ang anak namin at hybrid din naman set up ko sa work, magbiyahe sya kapag off ako sa work. 

Pero pagkalipas lang ata ng isa o dalawang buwan. Naisipan kong hiramin ang phone nya. Dun ko nakita, ang dami na naman ngang lending app, ang dami nya na namang loan. 

Yun pala nascam sya sa telegram, may nakausap sya dun na may gagawin lang syang activity tapos magkakapera sya. Pero para makuha yung withdrawal balance dun, kelangan  magtop up ng pera. Nasilaw sa malaking pera na pwede makuha, kaya nagtop up sya ng nagtop up. Kaso ang ginamit nyang pera ay galing sa utang at this time nakapangutang pa sya sa iba, sa tropa nya. Ang alam ko hindi bababa sa 30K naman ang utang nya. 

Hindi ko na sya tinulungan this time, kasi mauubos ako. Hindi lang financially, buong pagkatao ko, nauubos.

Nagsabi na din sya sa magulang nya, sabi nya sinabi nya na lahat. Kaya kinausap ko mother in law ko. Ang alam lang nya ay yung sa scam. Kaya sinabi ko na lahat sa kanya. 

Masakit lang sa part ko bakit hindi sya nagsabi saken kaagad, hinintay pa nya na lumaki. Malaking epekto saken nung 75K, kasi ako lang din naman halos gumagastos dito sa bahay. Savings at pangemergency ko nadin na pera yun. 

Ilang weeks nadin nakakalipas, bumaba nadin ang galit ko. Nasakto na nasa 200 karma ko dito sa reddit. Kaya nakapagpost na ko dito.

Nakapagisip isip at nasa acceptance stage na ko. Balik pagiipon at kapit kay Lord para gabayan kami.

Siguro kung nasa kasagsagan pa ko ng galit, puro mura nalang nasabi ko dito. 

Noon ko narealize na masamang pangitain nga pala talaga kapag may nabasag na baso üòÖ

I'm making this post out of sheer desperation and discomfort. I'm at my wits' end. I haven't been able to have a bowel movement for two weeks. Yes, you read that right‚Äî14 days.

It started out as a minor inconvenience, the kind of thing you brush off with ""I'll just drink more water."" But it has escalated into a full-blown physical and mental crisis.

Here's what I've tried so far:

Massive hydration: I've been drinking a gallon of water a day, easily.

Fiber, glorious fiber: I've been eating fibrous foods like a rabbit‚Äîoatmeal, salads, whole grains. I've also been taking fiber supplements.

Prune juice and coffee: My mornings now consist of a bitter cocktail of prune juice followed by strong coffee. It's done absolutely nothing except make me feel more bloated and a little jittery.

Over-the-counter laxatives: I've tried multiple kinds of stool softeners and stimulant laxatives, all to no avail. The stimulants just give me cramps with no results.

Gentle exercise: I‚Äôve been taking walks and doing light stretches, hoping to get things moving.

Dietary changes: I've cut out dairy and most processed foods.

I'm constantly bloated, tired, and in a state of low-grade discomfort that has made it impossible to focus on work or enjoy my life. The mental toll is honestly the worst part‚Äîthe constant worry and obsession over this is exhausting.

I know the common advice, but I'm looking for anyone who has been in a similar, severe situation. What worked for you? Did you have to go to a doctor? Is there something I'm missing here? Any specific products or remedies that are a last resort?

I'm ready to try almost anything. Thanks in advance for any and all advice.

TL;DR: Haven't pooped in two weeks, tried everything from water to laxatives, nothing is working. Looking for serious advice from people who have been through this, beyond the standard recommendations.",1,1754195608.0,NoPoo,3,1.0,False

But, after a few messages, things went quiet, and we didn‚Äôt talk for about four weeks (It was my mistake, I left her message unseen for 4 weeks straight). Then I sent her a meme out of the blue, and she liked it within minutes. Not long after, she liked one of my stories that night.

From what I‚Äôve seen, she seems like a genuinely good person, hardworking, grounded, and just‚Ä¶ Different in a way that stands out. I‚Äôve rarely felt this kind of interest in someone, not based on looks, but who she seems to be. Since I wasn‚Äôt sure how to keep the conversation going, I steered it toward studies.

The truth is, referrals get you jobs.  
Cold applying gets you ghosted.  
And the Berkeley Career Center won‚Äôt do shit about it....

So we stopped waiting and built something that actually works:  
**Golden Bear Job Referrals & Career Connections Discord**

It‚Äôs a private Discord for UC Berkeley alumni and students to help each other get jobs... through **real internal referrals**, **resume reviews**, and **no-bullshit advice** from people who‚Äôve actually done it.

We launched a [early access version](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1l9b0vk/starting_a_referral_resume_support_discord_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) earlier in June'25. Almost 1,000 Bears joined, word of mouth only. Now we‚Äôre officially opening it... starting with alumni and new grads. (Current student will come later.)

**We already have referrals available for these companies (50+):**  
Accenture, Anthropic, Salesforce, LinkedIn, Nvidia, Meta, Databricks, Lyft, ServiceNow, and more.  
And Yes! These are real Cal alumni, working there now, who can refer you internally. No fake hype. No empty promises.

**Why You (Yes, You) Should Join This as an Alum:**

* You remember how soul-crushing the job hunt was. That endless loop of cold DMs, ignored applications and interviews, and awkward coffee chats that go nowhere?
* **Worst case? You get laid off one day... and now you‚Äôve got this Discord at your back. Layoffs are brutal and random. But when it happens, you‚Äôll already be plugged into a network of Bears who‚Äôve got your back and give you referrals, ready to return the favor. You helped them, and they‚Äôll help you**
* Someone probably helped you... this is your chance to pay it forward
* You can make a real difference in under few minutes a week... Skim a resume or Drop a referral on your lunch break or boring meetings. That‚Äôs it
* Referring or giving honest feedback to Berkeley students can change their entire career
* You can stay totally anonymous if you want in the discord
* You‚Äôll wish this existed when you were job hunting. This is what we all needed back then ‚Äî and now we get to build it.
* You‚Äôll never get a cold LinkedIn DM here.¬†**No ‚ÄúHi, hope you‚Äôre doing well‚Ä¶‚Äù nonsense.**¬†That energy is dead.
* This isn‚Äôt some corporate career group. No ‚Äúlet‚Äôs grab coffee‚Äù energy
* You don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúmentor.‚Äù You just need to be real. Say ‚Äúyour resume sucks and needs work‚Äù or ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt refer you yet‚Äù ... that kind of honesty is more valuable than any coffee chat.
* You were lost, stressed, and under-qualified once too. Don't forget what it felt like to need a hand and not know where to ask.
* You don‚Äôt have to be a career coach, just be a human who remembers the grind.
* No one's selling anything. It‚Äôs literally just a bunch of Cal students and grads trying to make job hunting suck less
* It‚Äôs Berkeley-only (No randoms from the internet)

¬† A banner hung above the entrance to the upper-class hall. PARK CITY HIGH: HOME OF THE MINERS. Right then a few large boys dressed in football jerseys and jeans ran under the sign, jumping and high-fiving the Miner‚Äôs chisel as they went.  
  
¬† Junior year. A waste of time in one respect, considering I‚Äôd never make it to the end of the year, let alone graduation. I only had six months before the Tunnels came for me.  
  
¬† But I needed to be here. Needed to glimpse, for a moment, the life I had before. The year I should‚Äôve had. To see Jack one last time, despite how we left things. To see my family again.  
  
¬† This was my chance to say good-bye. It was a chance I didn‚Äôt get last time.  
  
¬† I scanned the hallway, searching for his face, but looked down quickly after catching a few questioning stares. I knew he was here somewhere in the building. The thought gave me goose bumps.  
  
¬† At least I had enough emotions left inside me to even get goose bumps. Blushes and chills didn‚Äôt take much‚Äî I‚Äôd recovered them about a week ago, along with all of my memories. But it was the stronger emotions, the ones that produced laughter and tears, that eluded me still.  
  
¬† I glanced down at my schedule. First-period English literature. As I checked the room numbers at the tops of the doors, curious whispers floated along the hall behind me, hanging in the air above my head.  
  
¬† Isn‚Äôt that Nikki Beckett? She looks awful‚Ä¶.  
  
¬† Is she still using?  
  
¬† Has to be‚Ä¶. What else would do that to a person?  
  
¬† Poor Jack.  
  
¬† Does he know she‚Äôs back? Does he know she‚Äôs strung out?  
  
¬† When I found the right room, I clutched my books to my chest, lowered my head, and walked through the door.  
  
¬† Someone‚Äîprobably the new English teacher‚Äîcalled from near the front of the classroom. ‚ÄúMiss Beckett, is it?‚Äù  
  
¬† Hearing my own last name did strange things to my heart. Made it beat a little faster. A little harder. It had been so long since I‚Äôd had a last name. For a hundred years, Cole had called me only by my first name. It was how the Everliving treated their Forfeits‚Äîif you didn‚Äôt have a last name, you didn‚Äôt have a life outside the Everneath. Nothing to want to come back to. Maybe that was why he was so surprised that I chose to Return.  
  
¬† I stopped just inside the doorway and lifted my head toward the teacher, keeping a few strands of hair in front of my eyes as I nodded in response.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWelcome. ‚Äù She hesitated as she took in my appearance. People did that a lot. My dad told me it was because I looked like a malnourished animal, ready to sprint. I‚Äôd lost a lot of weight, and my dark hair no longer held any curls. ‚ÄúThe principal told me to expect you. I‚Äôm Mrs. Stone. I see you have the textbook. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I nodded again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an empty chair in the back there, and here‚Äôs a supplemental book on mythology. ‚Äù She pointed toward the rear of the classroom, but I kept my gaze on her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to work hard to catch up with the rest of the class. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I turned and shuffled down the middle row until I reached the empty place at the back. Once seated, I took out my notebook and pencil and leaned forward over my desk so my hair created a curtain on either side of my face.  
  
¬† I could do this.  
  
¬† But I could taste the curiosity in the air. Literally. Cole used to tell me that the Everneath would change me‚Äîmake me more in tune with the emotions of others because I was so empty of my own. Now that I was back, I could ‚Äútaste‚Äù emotions hanging around me.

Certain emotions were stronger than others, and would hit me when I wasn‚Äôt ready. Like when my dad told me he was so happy I was back and that he didn‚Äôt blame me, but his disappointment in the air tasted as strong as a clump of salt.  
  
¬† It wasn‚Äôt so easy to identify most of them, except when an entire group was feeling the same thing.  
  
¬† Like now. Thirty people in a room, all curious.  
  
¬† But as the class settled in for the lecture, one emotion, separate from the curiosity, floated to the top of the rest. I couldn‚Äôt figure out what it was. It would‚Äôve been easier if I‚Äôd been prepared.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHi,‚Äù a familiar voice said from the desk next to mine.  
  
¬† I startled.  
  
¬† It was him.  
  
¬† Jack.  
  
¬† The boy who had gotten me through hell.  
  
¬† I wasn‚Äôt expecting him to be in my first class of the day. Here he was, my reason for Returning, but any words I used to know got caught in my throat. I wanted to run toward him and away from him at the same time, laugh and cry at the same time. Instead I froze.  
  
¬† All this way, just to see him, and I‚Äôd never planned for what to do next.  
  
¬† Jack‚Äôs voice sounded flat. Or more that he tried to make it sound flat. Maybe I was the only one who would‚Äôve picked up on that.  
  
¬† I kept my head down, took a deep breath, and picked the easiest of the words that were stuck in my throat. I exhaled as slowly as I could, and the word slipped out. ‚ÄúHi. ‚Äù  
  
¬† The word had no accompanying voice to it. Just the escaping air behind my lips.  
  
¬† He turned away from me to focus on Mrs. Stone. I wondered how I was going to get through the hour.  
  
¬† I took notes furiously, transcribing every word Mrs. Stone said. Since my Return, my emaciated muscles made my hands shake, and I looked for ways to keep them busy. It was part of the reason I took up knitting. In the two weeks that had passed since I walked out of the Shop-n-Go and back through the door of my father‚Äôs home, I had knitted an entire wardrobe‚Äôs worth of clothes, a few dog sweaters for my neighbor, and a handful of toaster cozies.  
  
¬† Mrs. Stone spoke animatedly about the role of the hero in mythology. When she asked the class for their favorite stories or figures from myths, several students raised their hands. A large kid in the back said, ‚ÄúHercules. ‚Äù Another boy, wearing a MATHLETES ARE ATHLETES TOO shirt, said, ‚ÄúAphrodite. ‚Äù  
  
¬† People laughed. I didn‚Äôt know why. It seemed to be an inside joke and I was an outsider.  
  
¬† Then a blond girl in the front row raised her hand and said, ‚ÄúHades and Persephone. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I couldn‚Äôt help flipping forward in the textbook to the story. I didn‚Äôt know why it would be anybody‚Äôs favorite. According to myth, Hades, the god of the Underworld, fell in love with Persephone, kidnapped her, and tried to make her his queen. When he tricked her into eating six pomegranate seeds, she was bound to the Underworld for six months out of every year.  
  
¬† Kidnapping and imprisonment. It was a horrible myth. I wondered where her hero had been.  
  
¬† Jack‚Äôs leg bounced up and down, distracting me. I wanted to reach over and put my hand on his knee and tell him everything would be okay.  
  
¬† But that was impossible. I stared harder at my paper and tried not to think about Jack‚Äôs leg.  
  
¬† The bell to end class startled me, and I dropped my pencil. It bounced on the floor, toward Jack‚Äôs desk. I froze. Maybe he hadn‚Äôt noticed. I‚Äôd wait and get it when the rest of the class left. I stayed perfectly still. The room cleared out, but I couldn‚Äôt sense any movement from the desk next to mine.  
  
¬† Before I could stop myself, I looked up.  
  
¬† He was there, motionless, holding my pencil in his hand, watching me. My eyes drank in the sight of him, even as my body fought the urge to bolt. His hair was the same rich brown color, but it was longer and shaggier than before. And his face had lost any signs of baby fat, making me think his mom had stopped forcing meatball sandwiches down his throat like she used to during football season.  
  
¬† His eyes were exactly as I‚Äôd remembered, exactly as I‚Äôd pictured every day for the past hundred years. Chocolate. But there was one difference: a single steel post pierced one of his eyebrows.  
  
¬† It wouldn‚Äôt have belonged on his face a year ago, but it somehow fit the face looking at me now. This face was edgier. This face had been through something.  
  
¬† He was beautiful.  
  
¬† I started to tremble. It took all of my strength, which wasn‚Äôt very much, not to run out the door.  
  
¬† He‚Äôd obviously waited for me to look at him. Like his voice, his face held no easily identifiable emotion to pinpoint. No love, no hate. He held out my pencil for me.  
  
¬† I reached over and grabbed it, my fingers brushing lightly against the palm of his hand. I could hear my own intake of breath. He didn‚Äôt flinch in the slightest. He didn‚Äôt draw his hand back.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMr. Caputo? Miss Beckett?‚Äù Mrs. Stone called from the front of the classroom. ‚ÄúAre you waiting for something?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, Mrs. Stone,‚Äù Jack said, keeping his curious eyes on mine. ‚ÄúJust saying hi to an old ‚Ä¶ friend. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I gathered up my books and tried not to think about how it used to be.  
  
¬† LAST YEAR  
  
¬† September. Six months before the Feed.  
  
¬† Six months before I went under.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, Becks!‚Äù Jules, my best friend, called out to me from the end of the hallway. Most of the students clearing their lockers for the day turned to look. Jules had a way of grabbing attention. ‚ÄúYou going to the game tonight?‚Äù  
  
¬† I was about to answer, but another voice rang out from just behind me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôd better,‚Äù Jack said as he wrapped an arm around my waist and pulled me back against him. I could smell the fresh leather on his letterman jacket as I crunched against it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy is that?‚Äù I asked, smiling and instantly warm in his arms. I still couldn‚Äôt get over the fact that Jack Caputo and I were ‚Ä¶ together. It was hard to think the word. We had been friends for so long. To be honest, he had been friends with me and I had been secretly pining for him since ‚Ä¶ well, since forever.  
  
¬† But now he was here. It was my waist he held. It didn‚Äôt seem real.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt carry the team to victory without you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my rabbit‚Äôs foot. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I craned my neck around to look at him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always dreamed of some guy saying that to me. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He pressed his lips to the base of my neck, and heat rushed to my cheeks. ‚ÄúI love making you turn red,‚Äù he whispered.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt take much. We‚Äôre in the middle of the hallway. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou want to know what else I love?‚Äù His tone was playful.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, but he wasn‚Äôt listening. He took his fingers and lightly trailed them up my spine, to the back of my neck. Instant goose bumps sprang up all over my body, and I shuddered.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I could feel his smile against my ear. Jack was always smiling. It was what made him so likable.  
  
¬† By this time, Jules had snaked her way through the throng of students. ‚ÄúHello, Jack. I was in the middle of a conversation with Becks. Do you mind?‚Äù she said with a smirk.  
  
¬† Right then a bunch of Jack‚Äôs teammates rounded the corner at the end of the hallway, stampeding toward us.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh-oh,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† Jack pushed me safely aside just before they tackled him, and Jules and I watched as what seemed like the entire football team heaped on top of their starting quarterback.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDating Jack Caputo just might kill you one day. ‚Äù Jules laughed. ‚ÄúYou sure it‚Äôs worth it?‚Äù  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt answer, but I was sure. In the weeks following my mother‚Äôs death, I had spent nearly every morning sitting at her grave. Whispering to her, telling her about my day, like I used to each morning before she died. Jack came with me to the cemetery most days. He‚Äôd bring a book and read under a tree several headstones away, waiting quietly, as if what I was doing was totally normal.  
  
¬† We hadn‚Äôt even been together then.  
  
¬† It had been on  
ly five months since my mom died. Five months since a drunk driver hit her during her evening jog. Five months since the one person who knew all my dreams disappeared forever. Jack was the reason I was still standing.  
  
¬† Yeah, I was sure he was worth it. The only thing I wasn‚Äôt sure about was why he was with me.  
  
¬† TWO  
  
¬† NOW  
  
¬† Lunch. Five and a half months left.  
  
¬† At lunchtime, my lunch sack and knitting needles in hand, I tried to weave my way through the crowded halls as fast as I could, searching for a quiet place to eat.  
  
¬† I turned a corner and a small group of cheerleaders broke out into some random rally song. The noise ricocheted off the metal lockers and rang in my ears and in my brain.  
  
¬† I ducked into an empty classroom and took a few deep breaths. It was hard for me to believe I had ever gone to school every day. How could anyone survive so many people in one place? Everything here was loud.  
  
¬† Even in this room, electric morsels of energy reached me, triggering my hunger, reminding me of where I‚Äôd been and how much of my own energy had been stolen. I closed my eyes and allowed myself a moment to wish that I had my own emotions back, that I wasn‚Äôt so empty.  
  
¬† I realized how much had changed. On the other side of a century, I had wanted to feel less, not more. Maybe most teenagers wouldn‚Äôt think like that, but when the drunk driver killed my mom, I wanted more than to stop feeling sad. I wanted to stop feeling. Period. I wanted it so bad that when Cole offered to make it happen, I went to the Everneath with him. Willingly.  
  
¬† Now I knew what really happened when emotions were gone. Cole bought himself another hundred years of life by draining me, and in the abyss left over there was no peace. Only an emptiness that made me ache as if my insides had been scraped out.  
  
¬† I peeked out into the hallway again. The crowds had thinned, but not enough. I wanted to go home. Or at least someplace quiet. But I‚Äôd promised my dad I would finish out the day.  
  
¬† Last year, I‚Äôd left my dad in the heat of an argument. I threw despicable words at him and then walked out and never came back. This time, I was determined to do things better. I would not leave him, alone in a room, with echoes of the things I never should‚Äôve said frozen in the air. I didn‚Äôt have control over much during my Return, but I could control how I would leave the people I loved.  
  
¬† He asked me to stay in school, and so I stayed.  
  
¬† When my heartbeat had regulated, I ventured out of the classroom and found the corner of the darkest hallway on the second floor. I wedged myself in the nook between a drinking fountain and the brick wall.  
  
¬† Homecoming euphoria wafted through the halls. I could taste it.  
  
¬† I focused on the wall beside the fountain. Blocked out everything else. The paint was peeling away. It had come loose in one large patch, perfectly intact, and was just hanging there.  
  
¬† I wanted to rip it off, but I didn‚Äôt. If I left it alone, maybe it could somehow fall back into place without cracking.  
  
¬† Last year, I‚Äôd counted down the days to the homecoming football game, crossing off the squares on my calendar. But last year was over a century ago.  
  
¬† This year, I wouldn‚Äôt be wishing away time.  
  
¬† I stared at the peeled paint. Nobody noticed me here. I‚Äôd found my spot.  
  
¬† LAST YEAR  
  
¬† Homecoming. Five months before the Feed.  
  
¬† The clock counted down from thirty, and the student section chanted each number. Park City and Wasatch had been in-state football rivals for decades, and this year, with Jack at the helm, the Park City Miners had the chance to take the ‚ÄúBoulder‚Äù home for the first time in ten years.  
  
¬† The Boulder was a piece of granite, brought down from the summit of nearby Mount Olympus, and it held more significance than any state trophy. Once, Kasey Wellington, the Park City tight end, had stolen the Boulder. His parents let him rot in jail for three days for shame. The only way to get the rock is to earn it.  
  
¬† When the clock reached ten seconds, Jules grabbed my hand. ‚ÄúThis is it!‚Äù she shouted over the roar of the crowd. Jack‚Äôs older brother, Will, was on the other side of me. He reached for my other hand, a proud smile on his face for his little brother. Then he offered me a swig of the silver flask he‚Äôd started carrying around in his coat ever since he‚Äôd turned twenty-one.  
  
¬† I gave him a disapproving look, and he shrugged good-naturedly, took a sip, then shoved it back in his pocket.  
  
¬† I wondered if Jack‚Äôs mom knew how much her other son was drinking.  
  
¬† Seven seconds. In big moments like this, each of the five senses becomes more acute. I knew the smell of mowed grass and mud, and the chill of the icy rain on my skin, and the sound of Jules screaming in my ear, would be grafted onto my soul and become part of the irremovable things about me. The stuff that memories are made of.  
  
¬† I breathed in.  
  
¬† Three ‚Ä¶ two ‚Ä¶ one ‚Ä¶ The bleachers shook as hundreds of fans jumped. It was so loud I had to cover my ears. Then the mass exodus from the stands started. Jules and I joined the rest of the school, scaling the wall that divided the fans from the field. Throwing my legs over the top of the barrier, I turned around and started to lower myself to the turf below. Two strong hands grabbed my sides, lifting me off the wall.  
  
¬† My feet didn‚Äôt even touch the ground. With his hands at my waist, Jack flipped me around so I was facing him and pulled me tight, my head above his, our noses inches from each other. ¬†His smile was dazzling. It always had been, but before, I was just admiring it from afar as he flashed it toward Lacey Greene or one of his other girlfriends.  
  
¬† Tonight it was for me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe did it, Becks!‚Äù He spun me around.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCongra‚Äî‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt get anything else out, because his lips were on mine. His mouth tasted faintly of salt. The eye black on his cheeks was no doubt smearing onto my face, but I didn‚Äôt care. We had this moment together, and I knew it would be over too quickly.  
  
¬† After all, he was the hero. Soon his teammates would be carrying Jack off the field on their shoulders. I knew if I wanted to date the quarterback, I‚Äôd have to share him on a night like this.  
  
¬† NOW  
  
¬† My lunch nook.  
  
¬† My knitting needles darted back and forth as they worked. My lunch sack sat untouched on the hard tile floor beside me. The drinking fountain next to my shoulder shuddered to life, cooling the water.  
  
¬† I liked the white noise and solitude my nook gave me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNikki?‚Äù  
  
¬† I paused the frantic knitting, but I didn‚Äôt look up. Maybe whoever it was didn‚Äôt mean me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBecks?‚Äù  
  
¬† Maybe not. Two feet appeared next to my lunch sack. How had she tracked me down?  
  
¬† I looked up. The girl looking down at me hadn‚Äôt changed at all. She was still beautiful, her round face as cherubic as ever, her long blond hair falling in curling cascades over her shoulders. That hair always looked like a snapshot of a waterfall, as if it should be moving.  
  
¬† She was uneasy. I could sense it.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHi, Jules‚ÄîJulianna,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† She smiled sympathetically and sank to the ground so she was facing me. I set my knitting down.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJules,‚Äù she corrected. ‚ÄúYou call me Jules. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I tapped the floor with my fingers, closing my eyes for a long blink. I felt one of the knitting needles being placed back in my hand, and when I opened my eyes, Jules set the ball of yarn in my lap. She fingered the flowers on the hat I‚Äôd nearly finished.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis is gorgeous, Becks,‚Äù she said. My nickname felt like warm coffee traveling down my throat, heating my insides. ‚ÄúWhen did you learn to knit?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTwo weeks ago. ‚Äù My fingers automatically began their work again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou always were a quick study. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I smiled. She used to hate the fact that school came easy to me.  
  
¬† Right then the bell rang, ending the lunch hour. I shot up to my feet, startling Jules. I couldn‚Äôt help it. Everything seemed louder here.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhoa, Becks. We still have five minutes,‚Äù she said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSorry. I just‚Ä¶‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know how to finish.  
  
¬† Jules squeezed my hand. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. I can only imagine what you‚Äôve been through. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She didn‚Äôt say it, but it sounded like she believed the rumors that I‚Äôd run away and ended up in rehab. At least she wasn‚Äôt asking me for the full story. I‚Äôd rather people believed the rumors than have to try to explain that I‚Äôd been in some version of the Underworld for a hundred years. I didn‚Äôt need everyone thinking I was crazy, too.  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt speak to anyone else for the rest of the day.  
  
¬† When I got home from school, my dad was in the living room with a woman in a gray suit he introduced as Mrs. Ellingson. She said she was there as my friend. I told her I didn‚Äôt need friends.  
  
¬† She asked me to pee in a cup.  
  
¬† Later that night my dad called me into his study. I knew whatever he wanted was serious, because the study was where all of our serious talks took place.  
  
¬† He was finishing up an email when I went in, so I sat quietly and looked around. The room smelled like leather. The dark wood walls of the study were covered with pictures of his accomplishments. His graduation ceremony from law school. His inauguration as mayor of Park City. Cutting the ribbon for the renovation project at the Egyptian Theater on Main Street.  
  
¬† There was only one family picture in the study, taken for our Christmas cards two years ago. My mom and dad sitting on a couch holding hands, me and my now ten-year-old brother, Tommy, standing behind them.  
  
¬† Poor Tommy. He was happy I was back, but he didn‚Äôt know what to do with me. It took him a full week to realize I was in no condition to throw the baseball with him like I used to. He always seemed to be waiting for me to say something. Anything. And then he‚Äôd leave disappointed. I loved him, but I didn‚Äôt know how to fix all of the things that were broken in our family.  
  
¬† My dad‚Äôs desk was scattered with papers, many of which showed bar graphs of the latest polling numbers for his reelection campaign. I wondered if the mess surrounding me affected those numbers, but I was afraid to ask.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs the campaign?‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† He held up one finger, eyes still on the monitor. ‚ÄúJust ‚Ä¶ one ‚Ä¶ minute ‚Ä¶ and send. ‚Äù He shut the laptop, and then clasped his hands together and placed them on his desk. ‚ÄúThe campaign‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs in Percy‚Äôs good hands. But that‚Äôs not what I wanted to talk to you about. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I didn‚Äôt think so.  
  
¬† He shifted in his chair, and the taste in the air only confirmed what his body language was telling me. My dad was nervous.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNow that you‚Äôre back, I thought we could discuss expectations. Specifically, what I expect from you, and what you expect from me. ‚Äù  
  
¬† It couldn‚Äôt be a coincidence that the first time we talked like this came after a visit from Mrs. Ellingson. She‚Äôd probably given him a pamphlet titled ‚ÄúDefining Expectations: How to Reconnect with Your Strung-Out Teenage Daughter‚Äù or something like that. But I‚Äôd promised myself to make things easier on my dad, and if this was what he needed‚Ä¶  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm listening,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGood. Here is what I expect from you. Number one: you will attend school, every day, and you will keep up on your studies. Agreed?‚Äù  
  
¬† I nodded. ‚ÄúYes. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNumber two: you will submit to random ‚Ä¶ testing from Mrs. Ellingson. Agreed?‚Äù  
  
¬† It sounded like he was hesitant to use the actual word drug. Maybe if he didn‚Äôt say it, it couldn‚Äôt be true. ‚ÄúAgreed. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNumber three: I‚Äôve arranged for you to do community service at the Road Home Soup Kitchen, starting next week. You will serve one lunch hour for every day you were gone. Clear?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúClear,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe Trib is sending a photographer. ‚Äù  
  
¬† A photographer? To cover me slopping soup? Percy Jones, my dad‚Äôs campaign manager, had probably arranged it. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNow your turn. What do you expect from me?‚Äù  
  
¬† I smiled and answered as honestly as I could. ‚ÄúNothing. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Apparently, that option wasn‚Äôt in the handbook, because my dad looked a little flustered. Before he could recover, I went over and kissed his head. ‚ÄúGood night. ‚Äù  
  
¬† As I walked away, I decided I would try to do everything I could to appease my dad in the little time I had left. I wished my mom were still alive. She would know how to comfort him now, and after I was gone.  
  
¬† The lights in Tommy‚Äôs bedroom were off, so I crept down the hall to my room. I opened my door as quietly as I could and shut it behind me without turning on the light.  
  
¬† I clicked on the lamp above my desk, illuminating the open English lit book. As I sat down, I thought about how I would be on display at the soup kitchen tomorrow.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this, Nik?‚Äù The deep voice came from inside my room, near my bed. I gasped and shot out of my chair.  
  
¬† Cole.  
  
¬† THREE  
  
¬† NOW  
  
¬† My room. Five and a half months left.  
  
¬† He wasn‚Äôt supposed to be here. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see him again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt you look at me?‚Äù he said.  
  
¬† Cole‚Äôs voice. I‚Äôd know it anywhere. The sound of it took me back to those long days in the Everneath, where the only things that existed for me were Cole‚Äôs voice and his touch.  
  
¬† I felt my pulse quicken all the way to my fingertips as a million questions flooded my head. Why wa  
s he here? What did he want?  
  
¬† But before I could say anything, I started toward him. I didn‚Äôt even realize I was doing it until I had almost crossed the entire room and made it into his now open arms. His presence made me aware of the emptiness inside me, as if the only way we would have a complete soul would be if we were together. A couple more steps and I would feel whole.  
  
¬† I froze.  
  
¬† What was I doing? I couldn‚Äôt be near him again. I couldn‚Äôt let myself trust him again. Following him to the Everneath had been my choice, but he‚Äôd made me think he would help me.  
  
¬† I hated him for letting me believe I had no other option.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStrange, isn‚Äôt it, Nik? The connection between us now. ‚Äù He grimaced and cocked his head to one side, as if he were waiting for me to close the distance between us. When I stayed perfectly still, he added, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to fight it. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Deliberately I placed one foot behind the other and backed up until I was sitting in my chair and gripping the sides to stay in place. I swiveled around so my back was to him and I was facing my desk again. I could think more clearly if I wasn‚Äôt looking at him.  
  
¬† It scared me that I hadn‚Äôt noticed him. If it had been anyone else waiting there, I would‚Äôve been able to sense extra emotions, but Cole survived on stolen ones. Those were harder to sniff out. I listened as his footsteps came closer.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to ignore me now?‚Äù He sighed.  
  
¬† My hands started to shake, but somehow I had the presence of mind to open my book. Running would be pointless. If I could just get through this, then maybe he would leave me alone.  
  
¬† I stayed completely still.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMythology,‚Äù he commented, looking over my shoulder, reading from the top of the chapter. ‚ÄúI could help you with that, you know. If you‚Äôd let me. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you could,‚Äù I mumbled. ‚ÄúYou were there. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAh, she speaks. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Reluctantly, I turned toward him, and he shifted the guitar that hung from his shoulder to his side. When Cole Stockton had first come to Park City more than a year ago to play at the Sundance Film Festival with his band‚Äîthe Dead Elvises‚Äî the school buzzed with excitement. Especially since the second guitarist, Maxwell Bones, had been dating a senior at Park City High, Meredith Jenkins. I‚Äôd met Cole through Meredith.  
  
¬† At the time, I thought he was mysterious and rebellious, but kind too. I knew better now. It was all part of the lie. Concerts were nourishment for Cole and his band. They could snack on the heightened emotions of a captive audience. It was an easy way to steal the energy he needed to survive between Feeds.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow did you get in here?‚Äù I said.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe window. The lock‚Äôs broken. ‚Äù He brought his guitar forward then and picked through a haunting melody, as if adding mystery to the broken lock.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be here. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Cole‚Äôs lip pulled up in the same smirk that had hundreds of teenage girls swooning last year. ‚ÄúShe was the original breath of life, you know. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIsis. ‚Äù He pointed to the open book behind me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI thought Persephone was the first. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe had a lot of different names. I used to tell you about Isis and Osiris. Don‚Äôt you remember? Or is it all gone?‚Äù He blew out a breath that smelled of ash, and then started to strum background chords. ‚ÄúOsiris was the first man who tried to straddle the line between the mortal and the immortal worlds. The first of the Everliving. The search for immortality nearly killed him. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He struck a minor chord.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen along came Isis. ‚Äù He walked over to my open book and ran his finger along a painting depicting a man, naked and lifeless on the ground, and a woman with wings hovering over him. ‚ÄúIsis breathed life back into Osiris. ‚Äù He paused and looked at me. ‚ÄúJust as you did for me. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Cole made eternal life sound as simple as breathing, but I knew better.  
  
¬† I slammed the book shut. ‚ÄúThat painting looks nothing like what I went through in the Feed. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf you think the Feed was bad, wait until the Tunnels come for you. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be much worse. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He looked at me, his eyes boring into my own. ‚ÄúYes, it can. I came here to show you. Something I should‚Äôve done in the Caverns. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Before I could protest, he placed his hands on either side of my head and I felt something whoosh inside. Immediately my bedroom melted away. Everything around me went pitch-black. My chest was crushed, as if it were in a vise, and when I fought for breath, I inhaled a handful of dirt, and choked.  
  
¬† Buried alive.  
  
¬† I fought and clawed at the heavy dirt weighing down on me, until my fingertips felt air. I dug my way out and fell in a heap on muddy ground. But I wasn‚Äôt outside. I was in a long, dark tunnel with walls of coal, hundreds of pale hands sticking out, flailing. I tried to crawl away, but the hands grabbed my ankles, my legs, my arms, and dragged me back inside the walls.  
  
¬† I opened my mouth to yell at Cole to make it stop, but the black rocks poured in, covering my tongue and pushing toward the back of my throat. The whole thing felt too real. The stones in my mouth cut the inside of my cheek, and I tasted blood. This was no vision. I was trapped.

A bit of history, I was extremely sick a few years ago, needed some strong antibiotics to recover from pneumonia, after which I got sick with chronic fatigue and others. Since then I noticed food intolerances like tomato, coffee etc and ended up with bad rosacea. I have been on daily doxycycline for close to 8 years. My guts is a mess and forced to be extremely picky with my food and stay away from anything that I know will trigger.

I want to get of doxy and hopefully eat normally again, my specialist suggested 36 hour fast followed by 12 hours eating whole foods in a hope to restore my natural gut flora. He said to do this for one month!

I did my first 36 hours yesterday and feel great, but knowing I have a month to go is daunting. Anybody have any advice?

Above, the moon cast a cold, silver glow on the rooftops, the only sound the distant howl of a lonely dog. In the alley behind the bakery, a shadow detached itself from the darkness, stretching out long and thin. It was a man, tall and lanky, with a face that looked like it had seen too many long nights and too little sleep. He checked his watch, a relic from a bygone era, and took a deep breath, the cool air filling his lungs.



The man was Jack, a creature of the night in every sense of the word. His job was unorthodox, his clients varied, and his successes were the stuff of whispers in the town's quieter corners. He was a hunter of the unseen, the unheard, the creatures that lurked in the shadows of the internet's darkest folklore‚Äîthe monsters of creepypastas. His office was the gloom, his tools were stealth and knowledge, and his quarry was the stuff of nightmares. Tonight, he was on the trail of something that didn't belong in the waking world.



Jack pulled a worn notebook from his pocket, thumbing through the pages filled with scribbled notes and hastily drawn maps. His latest job had brought him to this unassuming town, chasing after a creature known as the ""Gentleman with Thorns."" It was said to be a dapper figure, dressed in a tattered suit with a top hat, lurking in the night to prey on the lonely and the lost. The townsfolk had started posting warnings on social media, sharing their eerie encounters with the creature, and the local police were at a loss.



He approached the town square, where a solitary streetlight buzzed overhead, casting a yellow halo around a wooden bench. The light flickered, and Jack felt a shiver run down his spine. This was where the sightings had been most frequent. He leaned against the bench, the wood cool against his palms, and closed his eyes, listening intently. The silence was almost deafening, but he knew better than to trust it. His senses honed over years of hunting told him that something was out there, watching him, waiting. He could feel the weight of its gaze, a pressure at the back of his neck that made the hairs stand on end.



With a sudden burst of speed, Jack sprinted down an alleyway, the cobblestones slipping beneath his boots. His heart pounded in his chest as he heard the rustle of leaves and the sound of something moving swiftly through the shadows. The air grew colder, and he knew he was getting closer. His hand reached for the knife at his belt, the only weapon he allowed himself against these unnatural foes. The thrill of the chase washed over him, a familiar cocktail of excitement and fear that was his constant companion.



In the next alley, Jack skidded to a stop, his eyes scanning the darkness. A flicker of movement caught his attention‚Äîa figure standing at the far end, bathed in the pale moonlight. It was tall, dressed in a suit that looked like it had been ripped from a forgotten photograph. A top hat sat atop its head, and in its hand was a bouquet of thorns. The creature's eyes gleamed with an otherworldly light, and Jack could see the thorns digging into its flesh, drawing a crimson line down its wrist.



The creature turned to face him, its expression unreadable. The chase was on, and Jack knew that this night would either end in victory or become another entry in the annals of creepypastas. His heart raced as he took a step forward, the thorns in the creature's hand seeming to quiver in anticipation. The game of cat and mouse had begun, and he was about to find out if he was the predator or the prey.



Just as Jack was about to lunge, a blur of red and blue shot out from the shadows, colliding with the Gentleman with Thorns. He stumbled back, his eyes wide in disbelief as he watched two figures he never thought he'd see outside of a screen. Mario and Sonic, the iconic duo from the world of video games, were here, fists flying and feet stomping, tackling the creature with surprising ferocity. The plumber's overalls and the hedgehog's sneakers looked absurdly out of place against the backdrop of the old-world town.



Jack blinked, his mind racing to make sense of what was happening. The creature snarled and swiped at the newcomers, but they dodged with uncanny grace. Sonic's speed was a blur, his fists striking the monster with the precision of a metronome. Meanwhile, Mario's hammer smashed down, each hit echoing through the alley like thunder. The creature staggered, its body contorting in unnatural ways as it tried to fend off the onslaught.



Jack's shock didn't last long. Training took over, and he realized he couldn't just stand there, not when he had backup like this. He pulled out his knife, the silver blade glinting in the moonlight. The creature looked at him with a mix of anger and confusion, as if it couldn't believe a mere mortal would dare to stand against it with such legendary allies. But Jack knew better; he knew that even the most terrifying monsters had a weakness. He just had to find it.



The battle was fierce and chaotic, a dance of steel and shadow. The creature's thorns flew like shrapnel, but the two video game heroes deflected them with ease, their movements a testament to countless hours spent in pixelated worlds. The alley was a whirlwind of color and sound, the clanging of metal on flesh, the grunts of effort, and the squeaks of pain.



Jack studied the creature, looking for an opening, his eyes narrowed in concentration. As the thorns rained down around him, he saw it‚Äîa pulsing, glowing spot on the creature's chest. It was its heart, beating with a sickening rhythm. Without hesitation, he darted forward, knife poised.



The creature roared, a sound that seemed to shake the very air, and swiped at him with a handful of thorns. Sonic dashed in, knocking the thorns aside with a spin attack, and Jack took his chance. He leaped over the creature's outstretched arm, driving the knife into the glowing heart. The creature let out a final, agonized screech, its body convulsing as the light from its chest grew brighter and brighter.



With a final, desperate effort, the creature lunged at Jack, but Mario stepped in, delivering a super jump punch that sent it flying into the wall with a thud. The light grew blinding, and then there was silence. The creature crumpled to the ground, the thorns withering away to reveal a charred, unidentifiable mess.



Jack looked around, panting, his heart still racing. The alley was empty once more, save for the two video game characters who looked at him with a mix of curiosity and satisfaction. They nodded in unison before fading away, leaving him with more questions than answers. As he stood there, the reality of what had just transpired sank in. His job had just gotten a whole lot weirder, and he had the feeling this was just the beginning.



The sound of something zooming by in the sky snapped him out of his thoughts. He squinted, trying to make out the blur, and then it hit him‚Äîit was Saitama from One Punch Man. The bald hero in his yellow jumpsuit and red cape was moving faster than the speed of light. ""What's going on here now there's anime crossing over to my world,"" Jack murmured to himself, a bemused smile playing on his lips despite the surreal situation.



The smile grew wider as he saw what Saitama was fighting‚Äîan army of giant Skibity Toilets. The absurdity of it all was too much, and he couldn't help but laugh. The creature's signature theme song, ""Butabi,"" played through the night sky, adding an extra layer of bizarreness to the scene. The monsters were a twisted parody of a child's cartoon, their porcelain bodies clashing against the superhero's fist with explosive results.



Mario looked up, his mushroom cap tilting to the side. ""What's going on here?"" he asked in his classic Italian accent, the hammer in his hand looking comically small compared to the enemy above. Sonic rolled his eyes, a smirk playing on his lips as he watched the toilets plummet to the ground, one after the other, with a single punch from Saitama. ""Looks like we've got some extra entertainment tonight,"" Sonic quipped, his voice a mix of amusement and amazement.



Jack couldn't believe his eyes. It was like someone had taken the fabric of reality and shaken it up like a snow globe. He knew that his job was about to get a lot more interesting, and maybe a little more absurd. He took a deep breath, sheathed his knife, and started to walk away from the alley, his mind already racing with the implications of what he'd just witnessed.



The next morning, the town was abuzz with tales of strange happenings in the night. The police had reports of explosions and flashes of light, but nothing concrete. As Jack sat in a diner, nursing a cup of coffee, he couldn't help but chuckle to himself. He knew the truth, and it was a secret he'd take to his grave. Or, at least, until the next time he encountered something from the depths of the internet's imagination.



He pulled out his notebook and scribbled down a new entry: ""Giant Skibity Toilets‚Äîinvestigate anime crossovers."" It was going to be a long night, and he had a feeling he'd need all the help he could get. But with friends like these, who needed a quiet life?



Jack's phone buzzed with notifications, and he scanned the screen to find a barrage of messages from townsfolk reporting more unusual sightings. It was clear the merge of worlds was spreading beyond the alley, and the line between reality and the digital realms was blurring. He had to act fast before things got out of hand.



The next few days were a blur of chaos. He'd barely slept, running from one bizarre encounter to the next. The town was overrun with characters and creatures from every corner of the internet and beyond. Some were friendly, like the wandering Pikachus and Kirby, while others were less so, like the rogue pack of angry Ghosts from Pac-Man that had taken over the cemetery.



The most troubling was the sudden appearance of the villains. The Joker lurked in the shadows of the carnival, cackling madly as he tormented the townsfolk. Bowser had taken over the mayor's office, demanding a ransom in coins. And worst of all, the eerie whispers of Slenderman echoed through the forests surrounding the town. The once-safe haven was now a stage for the ultimate battle of good versus evil, with Jack smack in the middle.

.

The power that had brought these characters to life was something he hadn't anticipated. He'd been so focused on the creatures of creepypastas that he hadn't considered the implications of the full spectrum of digital folklore spilling into the real world. He had to figure out who or what had done this, and how to send them back before it was too late.



As he pondered his next move, Jack felt the ground tremble beneath his feet. He looked up to see the towering form of Godzilla rising over the cityscape, its fiery breath illuminating the night sky. His heart raced as he realized the true terror that had been unleashed. The line between reality and fantasy had been shattered, and the fate of the world was now in the hands of those who had once been mere pixels on a screen.



The townsfolk were in a panic, and it was clear that the local law enforcement was utterly outmatched. The world had become a playground for the creatures of nightmares and the heroes of legend. Jack knew he had to find the source of this madness and put an end to it before it consumed the very fabric of existence.



The hunt had just begun, and the stakes had never been higher. As he donned his gear and set out into the chaotic streets, Jack felt the weight of responsibility on his shoulders. This was no longer just about tracking down cryptids; it was about saving the very world he lived in from the most unlikely of invaders.



He knew he couldn't do it alone. He'd need to form an alliance, a team of hunters drawn from every corner of the digital realm. As he looked around, he saw potential allies in the most unexpected places‚Äîa gamer in a Link cosplay with a real Master Sword at his side, a young girl with a strange, glowing teddy bear that seemed to have a mind of its own, and a mysterious figure dressed in black, who looked like they'd stepped straight out of a detective manga.



The world had gone mad, but Jack wasn't about to let it end without a fight. He approached the trio, extending his hand with a firm nod. ""Looks like we've got a job to do,"" he said, his voice steady despite the tremors in his chest. ""Who's with me?""



The gamer looked up from his sword, eyes wide. ""What do you mean?"" he asked, his voice cracking slightly.



Jack jerked his thumb over his shoulder at the carnage. ""This isn't just a glitch in the matrix. Something's orchestrating this chaos, and I've got a nasty suspicion it's got something to do with that creep in the suit."" He didn't need to specify who he was referring to; the mention of Slenderman was enough to make everyone's blood run cold.



The girl with the glowing teddy nodded solemnly. ""My bear, it's been whispering to me,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. ""It says Slenderman's behind all of this. He's feeding on the fear and power of the characters he's brought here.""



The mysterious figure in black stepped closer, his eyes narrowed. ""And what do we do about it?"" he asked, his voice a low growl.



Jack took a deep breath, surveying the destruction around him. ""We form a team,"" he said, looking each of them in the eye. ""We find the source of this madness and we put an end to it.""



They nodded in unison, a strange mix of hope and horror in their expressions. Together, they set out into the fray, a motley crew of reality's last line of defense.



As they moved through the streets, the sounds of battle grew louder. They stumbled upon a horrifying scene‚ÄîMewtwo and Gengar were locked in a psychic battle, their powers ripping the very fabric of the air apart. The buildings around them groaned and crumbled as the force of their conflict sent shockwaves through the town.



Jack's eyes widened when he saw Mario standing in the center of it all, his eyes glowing with malicious intent as he threw fireballs at a row of TNT crates. The explosion was deafening, and the ground shook beneath their feet. The anime and video game characters lay scattered, their limbs torn from their bodies, twitching in the dust.



Jack's heart sank. He'd never seen such a gruesome sight, even in his darkest nightmares. He looked around, searching for any sign of life, but the street was a tableau of death and despair. ""What have we gotten ourselves into?"" he murmured.



The girl's teddy bear began to glow brighter, its eyes burning with a fierce light. ""You're not alone,"" it said in a voice that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. ""You're the chosen ones, the only ones who can stop this madness.""



Jack swallowed hard. He didn't feel chosen. He felt scared. But as he looked at his new allies, he knew he had to push aside his fear. They had to work together to save the world from the clutches of Slenderman.



The four of them moved forward, their determination growing stronger with each step. The air grew colder, the shadows longer, as they approached the epicenter of the chaos. A towering figure emerged from the smoke, tall and slender, with long, spindly arms that ended in clawed hands. The top hat and tattered suit were unmistakable.



Jack's heart raced as he saw the monster he'd only read about in the deepest recesses of the internet. ""We're coming for you,"" he shouted, his voice echoing through the ruins. ""And we're not going to stop until this nightmare ends!""



The creature's head tilted to one side, and a chilling laugh echoed through the air. ""You think you can stop me?"" Slenderman hissed. ""You're just a man, a mere mortal playing in a world of gods and monsters.""



But Jack had faced his fair share of nightmares before, and he wasn't about to back down now. ""Maybe so,"" he said, drawing his knife. ""But I've got friends in high places.""



The battle was fierce, a whirlwind of fire, steel, and psychic energy. The ground trembled as the forces of good and evil clashed, the fate of the world hanging in the balance. But Jack and his companions were driven by a single goal‚Äîto save reality from the digital abyss.



And as they fought, Jack couldn't help but wonder if he had bitten off more than he could chew. Slenderman's power was like nothing he'd ever encountered‚Äîit seemed to corrupt and manipulate every digital creature it touched. They turned on him, their eyes glazed over with a malicious intent that was all too human. Even the usually jovial Mario was now a twisted reflection, throwing fireballs that scorched the ground at his feet.



Jack watched in horror as the once-friendly characters mutilated themselves, the very essence of their being warped by Slenderman's influence. The sight was almost too much to bear, and for a moment, he felt his resolve waver. But then, something strange began to happen. A warmth grew inside him, a power unlike anything he had ever felt before.



Suddenly, Jack found himself growing stronger, his muscles bulging and his senses heightened. He could see the aura of each character, their life force pulsating with every heartbeat. He could feel the ground beneath him, the air around him, and the very fabric of reality bending to his will. It was as if every hero and monster from every game and story he'd ever read or played had been poured into him, granting him the power to stand against the unending tide of digital madness.



With a roar that shook the very air, Jack charged into the fray, his knife blazing with an energy that could cleave through the sturdiest of foes. He dodged and weaved through the sea of pixels and steel, cutting down any that dared to cross his path. The creatures of the digital world had become his adversaries, but now, Jack had become something more‚Äîhe was their bane.



The battle raged on, the streets of the town now a war zone of epic proportions. The air was thick with the smell of burnt circuitry and the screams of the tormented. Yet amidst the chaos, Jack felt a strange sense of calm. He had become a force to be reckoned with, a beacon of hope in a world gone mad.



He knew he had to reach Slenderman, to end this nightmare before it consumed them all. His newfound strength propelled him forward, his every step echoing like a thunderclap. The creature's laughter grew louder, more taunting, as if it knew the fate that awaited him. But Jack was not deterred. With each step, he felt the power of a million stories pulsing through his veins, each one a weapon in his arsenal.



As he approached the towering figure of Slenderman, the air grew colder, the shadows darker. The creature's arms stretched out, reaching for him, the thorns on its suit crackling with an unearthly power. But Jack was ready. He was no longer just a hunter of creepypastas. He had become the avatar of every tale ever told, and he was not going to let the monster win.



With a roar that seemed to shake the very foundations of the world, Jack swung his knife in a wide arc, the blade leaving a trail of light as it sliced through the air. The creature's laughter turned to a screech as the knife connected with its chest, the thorns parting like water around the silver blade. An explosion of energy sent Slenderman hurtling through the sky, his body contorting and writhing as he flew towards the moon.



The battle had been fierce, and the townsfolk had watched in a mix of terror and awe as Jack and his allies fought for their very lives. For days, the clash of digital and reality had torn through the town, leaving a path of destruction in their wake. Now, it seemed like it might finally be over. But as Jack stood there, panting and bleeding, he knew it wasn't.



With a burst of speed that defied all logic, Slenderman teleported back, reappearing right in front of him. The creature's hand shot out, and Jack felt a pain like nothing he had ever known as it hit him with a blow that sent him hurtling through the air. He crashed into the side of a building, the world spinning around him as he coughed up blood. His body felt broken, his spirit all but shattered. Yet, he knew that this was the final act, the moment of truth.



The creature loomed over him, its eyes gleaming with malicious victory. But Jack was not so easily defeated. He pushed himself to his feet, his knife clutched tightly in his hand. ""It's time to end this,"" he growled, his voice a mix of anger and determination.



The two adversaries faced off, their eyes locked in a battle of wills. The air crackled with the tension, the very fabric of reality seeming to stretch and warp around them. This was no longer a simple hunt; it was a battle for the soul of the world, a struggle between the real and the imagined.



Jack took a deep breath and lunged forward, his knife aimed at Slenderman's heart. The creature recoiled, but it was too late. With a swift, precise strike, the blade plunged home, and the creature let out a scream that seemed to shake the stars themselves. The thorns on its body withered and died, and the power that had fueled its existence began to bleed out into the night.



Jack stumbled back, his body aching, his mind racing. He had done it‚Äîhe had defeated Slenderman. But as the creature lay there, dissolving into a pool of shadow, he knew that the fight was not over. The digital realm was still merging with the real world, and it was up to him and his newfound allies to set things right.



The girl with the glowing teddy stepped forward, her eyes filled with a fierce determination. ""We have to go back,"" she said, her voice steady. ""We have to fix what he's done.""



Jack nodded, his gaze sweeping over the ruined town. They had won this battle, but the war was just beginning. And as he looked up at the moon, now marred by the silhouette of the defeated Slenderman, he knew that there would be many more battles to come.



The group set out into the night, their path illuminated by the flickering screens of the arcade machines that had come to life around them. They had to find the source of this crossover before the digital chaos spread too far. As they moved through the town, Jack noticed the air was thick with a buzzing electricity, a sure sign that the barriers between worlds were growing thinner.



Their first stop was the local library, a place where the scent of old books and the whispers of forgotten tales lingered. It was here that Jack had first heard of Slenderman, and it seemed fitting that they would seek answers in such a place. The building looked like it had been untouched by the outside madness, its quiet halls a stark contrast to the mayhem outside. The girl with the teddy bear spoke to the librarian, a stern woman with a penchant for order, even amidst the chaos.



They discovered an ancient tome, bound in a leather that seemed to shimmer with digital code. It spoke of a time when the veil between the realms was thin, and the first whispers of digital creations began to seep into the mortal world. The tome spoke of a gateway, a nexus where the lines between reality and the digital plane blurred. It was here that Slenderman had found his foothold, drawing power from the fear and belief of the online masses.



The group of unlikely heroes, now bonded by fate, set off to find this nexus. They ventured through the pixelated forest, dodging the rogue Pok√©mon and hacked arcade machines that had come to life. The air grew colder, the trees more distorted with each step they took deeper into the digital wilderness. They could feel the pull of the gateway, a pulsing energy that grew stronger with every beat of their hearts.



Jack's knife vibrated in his hand, a silent warning of the power they were about to face. The mysterious figure in black spoke up, ""The source of this chaos lies within the heart of the digital realm. We must be prepared for anything.""



They approached the nexus cautiously, the air around them buzzing with electricity. The gateway was a swirling vortex of pixels and code, a maelstrom that threatened to consume all in its path. ""We need to get to the center,"" Jack said, his eyes narrowed with focus. ""That's where Slenderman is drawing his power from.""



The girl with the glowing teddy nodded. ""My bear says we must seal the gateway,"" she said, her voice trembling. ""If we don't, more creatures will come through.""



The gamer in Link's cosplay stepped forward, gripping his Master Sword tightly. ""Then let's do it,"" he said, determination etched on his young face.



Jack nodded, his heart pounding in his chest. Together, they approached the gateway, each step feeling heavier than the last. The digital forest around them grew increasingly erratic, the trees and grass morphing into geometric shapes and glitching in and out of existence. The air was thick with the scent of ozone, a sure sign that the fabric of reality was close to tearing apart.



As they reached the edge of the swirling vortex, Jack could see the silhouette of Slenderman within, his arms outstretched as he drew power from the swirling chaos. The creature's eyes, two cold, glowing orbs of malevolence, locked onto them, and a smile stretched across his featureless face. ""You think you can stop me?"" he taunted, his voice echoing through the void.



Jack took a step back, his mind racing. They couldn't just charge in; they needed a plan. He turned to his newfound companions, the gamer and the girl with the bear. ""We need to disrupt the flow of energy,"" he said, his voice urgent. ""If we can cut off his power source, we might be able to weaken him enough to close the gateway.""



The gamer nodded, his grip on the Master Sword tightening. ""I can use my bombs,"" he said, pulling out a pouch filled with explosives. ""If we time it right, we can cause a distraction and maybe even some damage.""



The girl with the teddy bear stepped forward, her voice shaking. ""My bear, it says we must believe,"" she whispered. ""Our belief in each other, in the stories we come from, that's what will give us the power to win.""



Jack's eyes widened as he realized the truth in her words. The digital realm was a place of imagination, a world shaped by the power of belief. If they could harness that power, they might stand a chance. He turned to the gamer and the girl. ""We need to combine our strengths,"" he said, his voice steady. ""We're not just from different worlds; we're from different genres. That's our advantage.""



The gamer nodded, a hint of excitement in his eyes. ""I'll lead with the bombs,"" he said, his thumbs twitching as if on the controller of his favorite game. ""You two take out the smaller guys. We'll meet at the center.""



The girl with the bear took a deep breath, her eyes closed as she whispered to her glowing companion. The teddy's eyes dimmed for a moment, then flared with a fierce light. ""We're ready,"" she murmured, her voice filled with newfound resolve.



Jack took one last look at the digital hellstorm that lay before them, then nodded. ""Let's do this,"" he said, and together, they plunged into the chaos. The air was alive with the crackle of electricity, the ground shifting beneath their feet as the very fabric of reality strained against the digital intrusion. The monsters of the digital world threw themselves at the trio, their pixels sharper than knives, their roars echoing through the void.



Jack's knife sang as he danced through the battle, his every movement a deadly ballet. The gamer, Link's doppelg√§nger, sliced through the air with his sword, bombs exploding around them in a dazzling display of lights and sound. The girl and her bear moved as one, the creature's glowing eyes targeting the weaker points in the digital code, tearing them apart with a ferocious efficiency.



They pushed onward, fighting their way through the digital hordes, each step bringing them closer to the heart of the chaos. The air grew colder, the shadows deeper, until finally, they reached the center of the nexus. Slenderman loomed over them, his form a twisted mass of pixels and malice, his arms outstretched to the sky, drawing power from the very fabric of the digital realm.



The gamer stepped forward, a bomb in each hand. ""Cover me,"" he yelled, tossing the explosives into the air. They arced through the sky, a fiery ballet of destruction that exploded in a shower of sparks and shrapnel. The creature flinched, its concentration momentarily broken.



Jack saw his chance and took it, sprinting forward with the knife held high. The girl and the bear were right behind him, their combined energy a beacon of hope in the madness. As they reached Slenderman, the creature's smile grew wider, as if savoring the moment before their inevitable demise.



Jack plunged the knife into the creature's chest, the blade sizzling with the electricity of a thousand nightmares. The creature roared, its body convulsing as the digital world around them began to crumble. The girl's teddy bear leapt at the creature, its glowing eyes piercing the darkness, and with a final, desperate push, Jack felt the power surge through him, a torrent of energy that seemed to come from every hero and monster he had ever encountered.



The world around them shuddered, the very air crackling with the strain of two worlds colliding. The nexus began to close, the digital realm receding like a tide retreating from the shore. Slenderman's body disintegrated into a cloud of black pixels, his malicious laugh echoing into the void.



Jack collapsed to his knees, exhausted, as the world around him grew quiet once more. The glow of the arcade machines faded, the monsters vanishing like a bad dream. The gamer and the girl stood beside him, their eyes wide with wonder and relief. They had done it. They had saved the world from the digital invasion.



But even as the town began to rebuild, Jack couldn't shake the feeling that this was only the beginning. The digital realm was vast and ever-expanding, filled with countless more creatures and stories waiting to be told. And now that the barriers had been breached, who knew what other nightmares lurked in the shadows, waiting for their chance to step into the light?



He looked up at the moon, the silhouette of Slenderman now nothing but a fading memory. ""We'll be ready,"" he murmured, a promise to the world and to himself. ""We'll always be ready.""



And with that, the three of them turned to face the future, the digital and the real blending together in a way that was both terrifying and exhilarating. For Jack, the cryptid hunter, the job was never just about tracking down creatures of the night. It was about keeping the balance between worlds, ensuring that the darkness never fully consumed the light. And as long as there were stories to be told, he knew the job would never truly be done.",2,1754194158.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

Do any of you take medication and what kind of meds do you take? I'm a person who tries to go the natural route on everything so I am hesitant to take pharmaceutical meds because I'm not sure about the side effects (short and long term) but I want to be more present and get more done. 

Has taking meds helped you in your parenting and running the household? Please explain, what you take, the dosage and how has it effected you? Also what are the side effects short and long term?

Recently I bought 2 lbs of Diego Bermudez 'sLetty Bermudez from Manhattan and as I made my way through through 20+ brews I only once or twice got that amazing peach flavor that makes you wonder: is this a peach tea? a co-fermented? Incredible.

I've stuck to the Manhattan recommended recipe, I use a a Fellow EKG to pour and temperature, but for the life of me it's nearly impossible to get the same results across two different brews so I have been telling myself that perhaps it is the grinder?

I tried to keep the ration, technique and water temp the same and only change the grind settings in pursue of that perfect peachy coffee, to no avail.

Looking at all the videos raving about the clarity and how amazing coffee can taste I have been considering either a Lagom P64 or an Acaia Orbit.

But before I drop that $$$ on a grinder, I wonder for those who upgraded. Was it a day and night changes in flavors/consistency or are those like subtle improvements/ changing in flavors?

Got rid of a toddler desk, tons of framed art that no longer has a place or brings me joy, comic books, super hero collectibles, holiday decorations especially large outdoor ones that take up a lot of space, pi√±atas, birthday decorations, craft supplies, wreaths, knickknacks, an antique foosball table that was not functional, vases and ginger jars. It is all gone! Most of it was picked up immediately with people ringing my door bell to ask ‚Äúhow much?‚Äù When I told them it was free, you could see the joy it brought them. There were young people carrying framed art on scooters, the mom who is a teacher getting the pi√±atas for her Spanish class, the art student getting crafts, a new American getting their first Christmas decorations, a family with the same initial getting my holiday wreaths, and a young woman getting art for her first apartment. It brought me so much joy but also relief to no longer have that clutter and mental space in my small storage space (crawl space in a guest room). It was also crazy to me how fast other people took the items. It was easy. Curb alert. Posted items. By the time I came back from coffee with a friend, gone!

1mg9rnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mg9rnf/the_onair_light_turned_blue_and_thats_when_the/,The on-air light turned blue‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs when the nightmare began.,"Have you ever asked yourself why certain rules exist‚Äîrules that feel stitched together not by logic, but by fear?

Like‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt whistle after dark.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúNever look into a mirror at midnight.‚Äù

They sound like folklore, don‚Äôt they? The kind of stuff your grandmother whispered to you while locking the doors and pulling the curtains tight. But what if... one of those rules wasn't just superstition? What if one of those rules was the only thing standing between you and something you were never meant to hear?

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt answer the second phone after midnight.‚Äù

That was the exact line printed in bold, underlined red ink, on the rules sheet I was handed my first night working at a backwoods radio station.

And the worst part? I still don‚Äôt know who‚Äîor what‚Äîwas going to be on the other end of that call.

I was 26 years old, broke, heartbroken, and running from the shattered mess of a life I‚Äôd tried to build in Seattle. My engagement had crumbled like wet drywall. So I did what cowards do‚ÄîI vanished. Drove for hours until I landed in a nowhere town with a name no one remembers.

Granger Hollow.

It had one gas station, a sad little diner where everyone stopped talking the moment you walked in, and a forest that felt like it was always watching. The only light at night blinked red at the edge of Main Street‚Äîas if warning you not to go any farther.

That‚Äôs where I found WZRP 104.6, a forgotten radio station squatting on a lonely hill seven miles outside town. It looked like it had been built during the Cold War and never updated. Rust clung to the frame like scabs. Two rooms, a flickering hallway, and the smell of old coffee that had soaked into the walls.

They paid in cash. No taxes, no paperwork, no names.

Which was perfect. Because I didn‚Äôt want to be found.

The guy training me, Darren, looked like he had survived the station, but just barely. His skin was sallow, teeth the color of old ivory. Every few minutes, his eyes would flick to the clock like he was counting down a bomb.

As he left, he handed me one piece of paper. No contract. No instructions. Just‚Ä¶ rules.

WZRP NIGHTSHIFT RULES ‚Äì READ CAREFULLY

* Lock both doors by 11:45 p.m. sharp. No exceptions.  
* Don‚Äôt let anyone in. Even if they say they work here.  
* Only play the tapes labeled ‚ÄúOK‚Äù in red.  
* Don‚Äôt answer the second phone after midnight.  
* If the on-air light turns blue, go to the basement immediately and stay there.  
* If you hear breathing from the transmitter room, turn off the hallway lights and wait.  
* Don‚Äôt leave before 6:00 a.m., even if your replacement shows up early.  

I chuckled. It had to be a prank, right? Some kind of hazing ritual Darren pulled on all the newbies.

But when I looked up, Darren wasn‚Äôt smiling.

His eyes were dead serious. Hollow.

‚ÄúFollow the rules,‚Äù he rasped, ‚Äúor you won‚Äôt last a week.‚Äù

I should‚Äôve walked out right then. But I was broke, exhausted, and honestly? I just wanted to be left alone. Peace and quiet. That‚Äôs all I wanted.

That first night was eerie, but not unbearable. I played dusty rock tapes, read out weather updates for towns that probably didn‚Äôt even exist anymore, and tried not to think about the rules. The air smelled faintly of mildew and scorched wires. A hint of something older underneath, like dead things kept in a jar.

Still, the real chill came every time I passed the transmitter room. The door was always closed‚Äîbut I could swear I felt a breeze leaking out from under it.

Cold. Like standing in front of an open grave.

At exactly 11:45, I locked both doors. First rule checked.

Then, at 12:07 a.m., the second phone rang.

There were two phones on the desk. One was beige, plastic, ugly‚Äîprobably from Walmart. The other?

Jet black. Rotary dial. Heavy as sin. It looked like it had once sat on a military desk during DEFCON 1.

And that was the one ringing.

No caller ID. No reason. Just that slow, old-fashioned ring that hit something deep in your spine. Like the sound didn‚Äôt belong in the world anymore.

I froze.

Seven times, it rang. Seven times, I sat there, trying not to breathe.

Then it stopped.

I exhaled like I‚Äôd just surfaced from deep water. I had no idea I‚Äôd been holding my breath that long. But I hadn‚Äôt answered. That was the rule. And for now, I was safe.

The next few nights felt off, but manageable. Occasionally, I‚Äôd hear static from rooms that weren‚Äôt broadcasting. I started catching glimpses of movement in the glass reflection‚Äîjust out of sync with my own. But nothing ever came of it.

I told myself it was sleep deprivation. Or nerves. Or loneliness.

But then came night six.

And that was the night when the air changed. When the rules stopped feeling like folklore... ‚Ä¶and started feeling like a warning.

Some nights pretend to be normal‚Äîright up until they turn on you.

That evening started the way the last few had: quiet, still, and lying to me.

I brought the same scratched thermos full of burnt gas station coffee. Locked up at 11:45 p.m. sharp, just like the first rule demanded. The place creaked like old bones as I walked the halls, flipping through a stack of tapes with fading labels. Most were garbage. But I found one marked ‚ÄúOK - RED‚Äù‚Äîthe kind I was allowed to play.

So I slid it in.

Felt safe. Almost bored. Almost.

At exactly 12:02, the black phone rang again.

But this time‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt jump.

Didn‚Äôt flinch. Didn‚Äôt breathe. Just stared.

The rotary phone‚Äôs ring had become part of the landscape by now. Like thunder that never brings rain. It rang seven times, slow and deliberate. Then, as expected, it died.

I turned back to my notes‚Äîtried to focus on the music levels, my voice lines, the time check.

That‚Äôs when the air changed.

At 12:04, the on-air light turned blue.

And just like that‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt bored anymore.

My entire body locked up. The hair on my arms stood straight. My mouth went dry like I‚Äôd swallowed dust.

Blue light. That was on the list. I remembered the rule:

‚ÄúIf the on-air light turns blue, go to the basement immediately and stay there.‚Äù

Only problem? No one ever showed me where the damn basement was.

Panic doesn‚Äôt hit all at once. It trickles in‚Äîfirst the heartbeat, then the trembling hands, then the voice in your head screaming MOVE.

I shot out of the booth, hallway lights flickering above me like they couldn‚Äôt make up their minds. I started yanking doors open‚Äîone led to a supply closet full of empty tape boxes and dead spiders. Another opened to a restroom so small it barely deserved the name.

All the while, that blue light pulsed behind me, steady and unnatural. Not LED. Not halogen. More like... moonlight if the moon hated you.

But this blue light brought a vibration, deep and angry, like the ceiling was holding back a growl.

Then I found it.

Tucked in the back of the breakroom behind a half-collapsed tower of audio gear: a rug, faded and stained. Beneath it‚Äîa square hatch, old and iron, edges rusted like they‚Äôd been weeping blood.

I yanked it open. The hinges screamed.

Did I hesitate?

Not for a second.

The ladder led straight down into a tight shaft. The cold clung to me immediately‚Äînot the kind of cold you escape with a jacket. The kind that gets inside you. I climbed down anyway, rung after rung, until the hatch above became a square of flickering light, then vanished as I shut it behind me.

And then... the smell hit.

Damp earth. Rusted metal. Wet fur. And beneath it all‚Äîsomething sweet. Something rotten.

The basement wasn‚Äôt big. Just a single square of concrete with a low ceiling, like the building itself was pressing down to keep something contained. There was a cot in one corner, a filing cabinet long since rusted shut, and a radio, humming softly with static like it was breathing in and out.

I stood there, frozen, watching the shadows twitch.

Then, after a few minutes, the blue light above clicked off.

Suddenly, the vibration was gone.

Not stopped. Gone.

Like it had never been there at all.

But I didn‚Äôt climb up.

Not yet.

I waited. Five minutes. Ten. The static buzzed like it was whispering something just beneath human hearing.

Only when my knees started to lock did I finally climb back up the ladder, one cautious rung at a time.

The booth looked the same.

At first.

But then I saw it‚Äîthe tape I‚Äôd been playing was shredded. Not chewed. Not worn. Torn. Unspooled like someone had tried to rip it apart with their bare hands‚Äîor claws.

And then I saw the desk.

Three deep gouges, parallel, six inches long, carved into the wood right next to the mic.

Like something had tried to reach through... or out.

I checked the security cameras‚Äîmy fingers trembling on the keys.

Nothing.

Every feed showed stillness. Empty hallways. Silent doors.

But that was the thing‚Äîthe footage never showed what happened. It only showed what was left behind.

I went home that morning and lay in bed without sleeping, staring up at the ceiling as if it could give me answers. But it just stared back.

There‚Äôs a moment in every nightmare when you realize it‚Äôs not going to end. Not this time. Not when you wake up. Not when the sun rises.

That moment hit me around 2:17 a.m., during what I thought would be a quiet shift.

Everything had been silent. Still. Like the station itself was asleep.

But then‚Ä¶ the hallway lights flickered once‚Äîthen died.

Just like that, I was surrounded by shadows.

The air thinned. My pulse quickened.

I remembered one of the rules:

‚ÄúIf you hear breathing from the transmitter room, turn off the hallway lights and wait.‚Äù

Only... the lights were already off.

And what I heard wasn‚Äôt breathing.

It was whispering.

Dozens of voices, overlapping, broken, and layered like someone had taken five radio signals and tangled them together. Some voices were slow, almost crooning. Others were fast, like they were trying to warn me before something caught up.

But I couldn‚Äôt make out a single word.

Not one.

I stayed frozen in my chair. Muscles locked. Eyes wide. Trying not to blink too loud.

The whispers swirled around the walls.

And then‚Ä¶

A scratch.

From outside the booth.

Just a single, slow scrape.

Like a fingernail... dragging across the glass.

I turned to the sound, heart trying to pound through my ribs. The booth lights were off. The studio beyond the glass looked like a tomb.

I flipped the lights on.

Nothing.

No one.

Just empty hallway, peeling paint, and darkness that felt thicker than it should.

But then I looked again.

Smudges.

On the outside of the glass. Five of them. Finger marks.

Small. Too small. Like a child‚Äôs hand.

But I was alone.

At least‚ÄîI thought I was.

I finished that shift with a knife across my lap and my back to the wall.

Night Eight.

I arrived early, hoping to catch Darren.

Hoping maybe I could ask what the hell I had gotten into.

But Darren wasn‚Äôt there.

Instead, there was someone else. Sitting on the steps in front of the station like she‚Äôd been waiting for me.

A woman. Mid-thirties. Pale. Stringy black hair, hoodie zipped all the way up to her chin. No car. No bag. Nothing.

Just... sitting there.

She looked up.

‚ÄúAre you the night guy?‚Äù

Her voice was flat. Like someone who had seen too much to be surprised anymore.

I didn‚Äôt answer.

She stood.

Her eyes were wrong.

No white. Just black‚Äîfull pupils, swallowing up every bit of light around them.

‚ÄúI used to work here,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBefore they changed the rules.‚Äù

That line hit like a punch.

She took a step toward me.

I instinctively backed up‚Äîtoward my car, keys gripped tight in my fist.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be here after tonight,‚Äù she said, voice soft, like she was warning me from a burning building.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre getting stronger.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù I asked, my voice barely holding together.

She didn‚Äôt answer.

Just turned‚Ä¶ and walked into the woods.

No flashlight. No trail. Just vanished between the trees like she‚Äôd never been there.

I waited five minutes, eyes locked on that tree line.

She never came back out.

That night, the black phone didn‚Äôt ring.

But at 3:06 a.m., the other phone did.

The beige one. Cheap. Modern. Harmless-looking.

I stared at it.

Technically‚Ä¶ the rules never said I couldn‚Äôt answer that one.

So I did.

Static.

Just for a moment.

Then‚Äî

A voice. Whispered. Close. Like it was behind me, not through the line.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not following them.‚Äù

Click.

The line went dead.

I dropped the phone like it was on fire and stared at the rules sheet pinned to the wall.

Read it once.

Twice.

Looking for anything I missed.

And that‚Äôs when I saw it.

At the very bottom of the page‚Äîin tiny, faded print. Almost invisible.

‚ÄúEvery time you survive the blue light, a new rule is added. You must find it before your next shift.‚Äù

What?

I flipped the paper over.

Nothing.

Held it to the lamp‚Äîwatched the light bleed through the sheet‚Äîand there it was:

Faint red ink, hidden behind the typed text. Smudged, but legible.

I rubbed my thumb over the words.

And they rose like bruises.

8. Never say your real name on-air. It hears names. It remembers.

That‚Äôs when I realized‚Ä¶

The rules weren‚Äôt just keeping things out.

They were keeping me from being seen. From being heard.

Because something‚Äîsomewhere inside this station‚Äîwas always listening.

I broke the eighth rule.

Not on purpose. Not loudly. Just once.

But it was enough.

And when I heard my own name whispered back to me‚Äîfrom inside the transmitter room‚ÄîI knew‚Ä¶

There‚Äôs no hiding anymore.

Have you ever felt the world tilt‚Äînot with motion, but with meaning? Like everything around you is suddenly wrong, and the air itself knows your name?

I walked into the station that night with shaking hands and eyes red from another night without sleep.

But it wasn‚Äôt exhaustion gnawing at me.

It was fear. Raw, creeping, marrow-deep fear.

Because I‚Äôd seen the hidden rule.

‚ÄúNever say your real name on-air.‚Äù

And I had. Every. Single. Night.

‚ÄúHey, this is Nate. You‚Äôre listening to WZRP 104.6‚Ä¶‚Äù

God help me‚ÄîI‚Äôd fed it.

At 12:00 a.m. sharp, the black phone rang.

Same as always. That ancient rotary buzz, slow and deliberate like a countdown.

I didn‚Äôt answer.

I couldn‚Äôt.

Instead, I walked to the breakroom, pried back the dusty rug, and opened the hatch.

The basement.

I had to know what was really down there.

What I‚Äôd been hiding from all this time.

But when I lifted the hatch‚Äî

Something was different.

The cot was gone.

In its place, carved into the concrete like something had burst up from beneath it‚Ä¶

Was a hole.

Not man made. Not natural.

Torn. Clawed. Violent. The jagged edges of the cement curled upward like it had melted and ripped at the same time.

And the dirt around it was scattered‚Äînot from something coming in‚Ä¶ but from something getting out.

I stepped back, slow and shaking.

Then the radio hissed.

Loud. Sharp. Alive.

And then‚ÄîI heard my own voice.

‚ÄúHey, this is Nate. You‚Äôre listening to WZRP 104.6, the Pulse of Nowhere‚Äîkeeping you company through the long, cold night.‚Äù

My exact words. From Night One.

But I hadn‚Äôt hit play.

The tape deck was off.

I ran‚Äîsprinted‚Äîback to the booth, adrenaline cutting through the fog in my brain.

The red ‚ÄúON AIR‚Äù light was glowing. Normal. Calm. Lying.

I reached for the mic switch to cut the feed.

And that‚Äôs when it changed.

The light turned blue.

Everything stopped.

No static. No hum. No music.

Just dead air.

And then‚Äî

Breathing.

Heavy. Wet. Uneven.

But it wasn‚Äôt coming from the transmitter room this time.

It was inside the booth.

With me.

Behind me.

I turned.

Slow.

And in the far corner‚Äîjust past where the shadows met the wall‚Äîwas something standing.

Tall.

Thin.

Barely there‚Äîlike heat distortion wearing skin.

It had no face.

But its mouth opened.

And inside that mouth... were my own teeth.

I bolted.

Out the door. Down the hall. Past the transmitter room. Past walls still scarred from claw marks.

The building groaned around me. The shadows felt heavier. Like they were watching me.

I didn‚Äôt stop.

Didn‚Äôt close the hatch.

Didn‚Äôt climb down.

I jumped.

Straight into the basement.

The air was colder than before.

Colder than death.

The blue light above pulsed through the cracks like it was bleeding.

Then‚Äî

A thud.

Above me. Then another.

Something had followed me.

It didn‚Äôt care about the rules anymore.

It had been invited.

And then, in that pitch-black basement‚Äîmy back against the wall, lungs burning‚ÄîI remembered something.

A whisper. Barely more than a mumble.

Something Darren had said to me my first night.

‚ÄúThey only get in if you break three rules.‚Äù

Three.

I counted.

1. I said my name on-air.  
2. I didn‚Äôt find the new rule in time.  
3. I answered the beige phone.  

Three.

Not just mistakes.

Keys.

Each rule wasn‚Äôt just a warning.

They were locks.

And every one I broke?

Turned the key the wrong way.

Now the lock was undone.

Now the door was open.

And something had stepped through.

The rules weren‚Äôt just there to protect me.

They were there to contain it.

And now, it knew my name.

I don‚Äôt remember climbing out of the basement. I don‚Äôt remember the stairs. The hatch. The door.

All I know is‚ÄîI woke up in my car.

Half in a ditch.

Parked sideways on the gravel road that led up to the station.

The windshield was cracked. The radio was dead. My hands were covered in blood. Not mine.

I stumbled out, lungs aching, head full of static.

Looked up toward the hill.

WZRP 104.6 was gone.

Nothing but a scorched black skeleton silhouetted against the dawn. The tower was a twisted metal husk. The booth, the hallway, the transmitter room‚Äîall burned to the ground.

But I didn‚Äôt have a single burn on me.

Not even soot.

And no one in town said a word about it.

I walked into the diner that morning like a man returning from war.

The bell above the door jingled like normal.

The waitress looked up.

Didn‚Äôt flinch. Didn‚Äôt gasp. Just said‚Äî

‚ÄúYou lasted longer than the last guy.‚Äù

No questions. No sympathy. No disbelief.

Just‚Ä¶ acknowledgement.

Like I‚Äôd completed a shift someone else had abandoned years ago.

I didn‚Äôt respond.

Didn‚Äôt sit down.

Didn‚Äôt order coffee.

Just turned and left.

That afternoon, I packed what little I had and left the town behind without a single goodbye.

Didn‚Äôt even leave a note.

But I took something with me.

The rules.

I don‚Äôt know why.

I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to throw them away.

Even after the station was ash, even after the nightmare ended‚Äîor pretended to‚ÄîI kept that single sheet of paper.

Folded. Worn. Still faintly warm, somehow.

I tucked it into my glove compartment. Sometimes I check it. Make sure it‚Äôs real. That I didn‚Äôt make it all up.

Eight rules.

Still printed in the same weird, off-kilter type.

Still signed by no one.

But this morning‚Ä¶ when I checked it again...

There were nine.

Same faint red ink. Same pressure like it had been scrawled in a hurry, in fear.

A new rule. One I‚Äôd never seen before.

9. If you ever leave, never talk about the station out loud. It still listens. It still remembers.

I stared at it for a long time.

Mouth dry. Hands trembling.

I hadn‚Äôt said anything.

Not out loud.

other than that, life has been moving.  two days after the breakup, I had exams (divine timing, right?). studied through tears, showed up anyway, and somehow killed it. healing and high scores can apparently coexist.

work‚Äôs been its own kind of magic there are new projects, growth in places I didn‚Äôt expect, the kind of busy that feels like blooming. I helped in writing a research paper too. maybe it‚Äôll even get published. maybe I‚Äôll be published and at peace. imagine that.

Give me whipped cream, caramel, pastry, butter all day. But as I test more fragrances, I'm realizing that I never really like the ""edible"" smelling ones. The closest it gets for me is Cloud, MM Coffee Break, Nemat Vanilla Musk, and Burberry Goddess. Those are some of my most used perfumes, and something sets them apart from other vanillas. I clearly like some sweetness, but I can't stand the powdered sugar vanilla drydowns I get from things like Dulce by Rosie Jane and Boardwalk Delight by Skylar. I also can't stand the marshmallow notes in Kilian Princess and Commodity Milk. MM afternoon delight toes the line for me - I really like the realistic buttery pastry smell from it, but the drydown gets closer to a plain vanilla sugar. 

What am I missing here? Why do I keep thinking I'll like gourmands? I think part of this is telling me that I like synthesized and blended frags more than literal interpretations. I think I should branch out into more freshies from here or something creamy but non-gourmand (philosykos comes to mind, though I haven't tried it). ",6,1754193386.0,FemFragLab,7,1.0,False

I was working on a completely unrelated project‚Äîa youth sports coaching analytics app‚Äîand while looking for a domain name for it, I stumbled into the .ai top-level domain rabbit hole.

One domain stood out: bewareof.ai.

I couldn‚Äôt believe it wasn‚Äôt taken, so I grabbed it on impulse‚Äîthinking I‚Äôd just park it or resell it later. But after I paid for it (the .ai domains are crazy expensive and require a 2 year contract), I started asking myself: Could I actually make something interesting with this?

That turned into a creative side project I‚Äôm running now:

A weekly series of \~1,000-word flash fiction stories, each one reimagining a public domain classic or inventing something new‚Äîbut always with an AI twist. Think Frankenstein meets OpenAI, or Hansel & Gretel navigating a digital trap built by synthetic minds. Sometimes it‚Äôs dark satire, sometimes eerie, sometimes weirdly funny.

I use GPT as a writing partner‚Äîbrainstorming, drafting, refining‚Äîbut I heavily curate and edit each piece. It‚Äôs not just auto-generated fluff. The goal is to create snack-sized, high-quality fiction about the weird directions AI could go in if we‚Äôre not careful.

I don‚Äôt really expect to monetize it beyond some ads and maybe ‚Äúbuy me a coffee‚Äù tips, but I‚Äôm curious:  
	‚Ä¢	Do you like reading light, one-sitting fiction?  
	‚Ä¢	Would you check out something like this weekly if the tone was consistently fun/creepy/smart?  
	‚Ä¢	Is the idea of ‚Äúusing .ai to write stories about evil .ai‚Äù too on-the-nose‚Äîor exactly the right amount of meta?

Anyway, the first few stories are live now. More dropping weekly.

First, I have gravitated, as seems advised on here, to brew first -- after steaming, I am not sure how to get the temp down for espresso. Just about that, though:  After brewing, do I have to wait after flipping on steam, all the way to the heating light going off. That is a ... long ... delay to drink your coffee, I think. How long do people wait? 

Second, this means I don't know how to turn around and make someone else a second milk drink: I don't know how to get the temp down far enough without turning the whole machine off and waiting a looong time. 

any advice?

Armentrout:    Bloodied, dirtied rope circled the ankles and wrists. When she slowly lifted her chin and her lashes fluttered open, her startled cry came from deep within a well of endless terror. It was in her wide glazed-over eyes. She knew. Oh yeah, she knew.......","Chapter 1  
  
¬† My heart started racing as my gaze trekked to the rearview mirror. My brown eyes seemed too big and wide at the moment. I looked freaked out, and I was.  
  
¬† Taking a deep breath, I grabbed my purse and opened the door of my Honda, stepping out. Cold air immediately coasted under the thin sweater I wore as I closed the door behind me. I inhaled deeply, surrounded by the scent of freshly cut grass.  
  
¬† I took a step toward the inn I‚Äôd grown up in and hadn‚Äôt seen in years. It was the way I remembered. Wind stirred the vacant rockers. The bushy ferns that hung from late spring to early fall were gone. The clapboard was painted a fresh white. Shutters a deep forest green and . . .  
  
¬† And my throat dried. Tiny bumps raced across my skin, lifting the wisps of blond hair at the nape of my neck. An awful, surreal feeling slammed into my gut. My breath caught in my throat once more.  
  
¬† The feeling was like a slick, too-heavy caress down the center of my back. The nape of my neck burned like it had when he would sit behind me‚Äî  
  
¬† Pivoting around, I scanned the front yard. Tall hedges lined the property. It was a decent distance from Queen Street, the main road cutting straight through the town, but I could hear the cars passing by. No one was out here. I turned full circle. No one was on the porch or in the yard. Maybe someone was at one of the windows or the inn, but I was alone out here despite the way my pulse pounded or what instinct screamed at me.  
  
¬† I focused on the green hedges again. They were so thick someone could be hidden behind them, watching and waiting for‚Äî  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStop it.‚Äù I closed my free hand into a fist. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being paranoid and stupid. Just stop it. No one is watching you.‚Äù  
  
¬† But my heart didn‚Äôt slow down and a fine tremor coursed through my tensing muscles. I reacted physically and without thought.  
  
¬† I panicked.  
  
¬† Icy claws of terror sunk deep into my chest and I ran‚Äîran from the side of my car and into the inn. Everything was a blind blur as I hit the stairs and kept running, all the way to the upper level.  
  
¬† There, in the quiet and narrow hallway outside the apartments above the inn, out of breath and feeling sick, I dropped my purse on the floor and bent over, clasping my knees as I dragged in deep, uneven breaths.  
  
¬† I hadn‚Äôt stopped to notice if the inn had changed in the years I‚Äôd been absent, hadn‚Äôt stopped to find my mother. I‚Äôd run like there were demons snapping at my heels.  
  
¬† And that was how this felt.  
  
¬† This was a mistake.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I whispered to the ceiling. I leaned against the wall and smoothed my hands down my face. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a mistake.‚Äù  
  
¬† Lowering my arms to the wall, I forced my eyes open as I dragged in a deep breath. Of course I would have a . . . strong reaction to returning home, to coming back here after everything had happened.  
  
¬† When I left, I‚Äôd sworn I‚Äôd never come back.  
  
¬† Never say never.  
  
¬† Those three words had been cycling over and over from the moment I‚Äôd made the decision to return home. I almost couldn‚Äôt believe I was actually sitting here, that I‚Äôd done what I‚Äôd said I‚Äôd never do.  
  
¬† As a child, I‚Äôd been convinced the inn had been haunted. How could it not be? The Georgian-style mansion and the adjacent carriage house were older than dirt, used as a part of the Underground Railroad and rumored to have been occupied by injured and dying soldiers after the bloody Battle of Antietam.  
  
¬† Floorboards creaked throughout the night. Cold spots lingered in rooms. The old dimly lit servants‚Äô staircase had creeped me out like nothing else. Shadows always seemed to slink along the wallpapered walls. If ghosts were real, then this inn, the Scarlet Wench, should be full of them. And as a twenty-nine-year-old fully grown woman, I was still convinced it was haunted.  
  
¬† Haunted by a different kind of ghost now.  
  
¬† What roamed those narrow halls on the upper levels, tiptoed across polished floors, and hid in the darkened stairwells was the old Sasha Keeton from ten years ago, before . . . before the Groom came to the town where nothing ever happened, and destroyed everything.  
  
¬† I‚Äôd sworn that I would never come back to this town, but like Grandma Libby used to say all the time, never say never.  
  
¬† Sighing, I pushed away from the wall and looked down the hall.  
  
¬† Maybe I wouldn‚Äôt have flipped out so strongly if I hadn‚Äôt heard the news on the radio just as I was leaving the interstate‚Äînews of a woman missing from Frederick. I caught the tail end of her name‚ÄîBanks. She was a nurse at Memorial Hospital. Her husband had last seen her the morning she‚Äôd left for work.  
  
¬† My breath caught as a cold shiver skated over my skin. Frederick was not far from Berkeley County. Usually a forty-five-minute drive on days when the traffic wasn‚Äôt bad. The tips of my fingers felt icy as I opened and closed them.  
  
¬† One missing person was horrible and sad, incredibly tragic no matter the circumstances. Multiple missing people was terrifying, major news, and a pattern‚Äî  
  
¬† Cursing under my breath, I cut those thoughts off. The missing woman had nothing to do with me. Obviously. God knows I fully understood how traumatic a missing person could be, and I really hoped that the woman was found safe, but it had nothing to do with me.  
  
¬† Or with what happened ten years ago.  
  
¬† The brisk early-January winds rolled across the roof, startling me. My heart thundered against my ribcage. I was as s  
kittish as a mouse in a room full of starved cats. This was‚Äî  
  
¬† My cellphone rang, jarring me out of my thoughts. Bending over, I reached inside the oversized hobo bag and dug around until my fingers curled around the slim surface. I pulled it out, lips twitching when I saw the caller.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSasha,‚Äù Mom said the moment I hit answer. Her laugh made my smile spread. ‚ÄúWhere in the world are you? I saw your car out front, but you‚Äôre nowhere to be found.‚Äù  
  
¬† I winced a little. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm upstairs. I got out of the car and started to walk in, but I . . .‚Äù I didn‚Äôt want to say the words, admit how unnerved I was.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDo you need me to come upstairs?‚Äù she asked immediately, and I squeezed my eyes shut.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm fine now.‚Äù  
  
¬† There was a pause. ‚ÄúSasha, honey, I . . .‚Äù Mom faded off, and I could only wonder what she was about to say. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre finally home.‚Äù  
  
¬† Home.  
  
¬† Most twenty-nine-year-olds would feel like a failure if they returned home, but for me, it was the opposite. Coming home was an accomplishment, a feat not easily completed. Opening my eyes, I swallowed another sigh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming down.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI was guessing you would.‚Äù She laughed again, but it sounded shaky. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the kitchen.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù I clenched the phone tighter. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there in a few.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAll right, honey.‚Äù Mom hung up, and I slowly placed my phone back in the bag.  
  
¬† For a moment, I stood stock-still, rooted to the floor, and then I nodded curtly. It was time.  
  
¬† It was finally time.  
  
¬† I was floored.  
  
¬† The inside looked nothing like I remembered. I stepped through the foyer, blown away by the change that had taken place in the last ten years.  
  
¬† Purse dangling from my fingertips, I slowly made it through the main floor. The vases full of artificial orchids were new and the dated chairs by guest check-in were gone. The two great rooms had been opened up to create one large space. Soothing gray paint replaced the flowery wallpaper. The old traditional chairs with the velvet upholstery had been changed to teal-and-white thick-cushioned wingback chairs strategically placed around the end tables for easy conversation. The brick fireplace had been stripped back and painted white.  
  
¬† Another surprise waited when I entered the dining area of the inn. Gone was the cold, formal table that forced every guest to eat together if they dined at the inn. I‚Äôd always hated that, because hello, awkward. Five large round tables covered in white linen were staged throughout the large room. The fireplace in here was painted to match the one in the sitting room. Flames rippled behind the glass. A station to serve drinks had been moved into the room and sat catty-corner to the fireplace.  
  
¬† The Scarlet Wench had finally come into the twenty-first century.  
  
¬† Had Mom mentioned this at some point? We‚Äôd talked on the phone a lot and Mom had visited in Atlanta multiple times in the last ten years. She had to have brought this up. She probably had, but I tended to zone out anything related to this town, and I must‚Äôve zoned out way too much.  
  
¬† This was significant; seeing this was important, because now I knew I‚Äôd checked out way too deeply.  
  
¬† A knot formed in the back of my throat and stupid tears burned the back of my eyes. ‚ÄúOh God,‚Äù I murmured, wiping the back of my hands under my eyes as I blinked rapidly. ‚ÄúOkay. Pull it together.‚Äù  
  
¬† Counting to ten, I cleared my throat and then nodded. I was ready to see my mama. I could do this without breaking down and crying like an angry, hungry baby.  
  
¬† Once I was sure I wasn‚Äôt going to have an epic meltdown, I got my feet moving. The scent of roasted meat led me to the back of the house. A pocket door with staff only posted was closed. Reaching for it, I was suddenly thrust back into the past, and within seconds I saw myself running through this very door and into the arms of my waiting father after the first day of kindergarten, the watercolor painting I‚Äôd done flapping from my outstretched hand. I remembered shuffling through this door the first time my heart had been crushed, my face streaked with dirt and tears because Kenny Roberts had pushed me into the mud at the playground. I could see myself at fifteen, knowing my dad would never be waiting for me again.  
  
¬† And I saw myself bringing the boy I‚Äôd met in Econ 101 through this very door to meet Mom, and my heart did an unsteady flop, pulling me right out of the stream of memories.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúGod,‚Äù I groaned, shutting that train wreck of a thought process down before those pale blue wolf eyes formed in my mind. Because once that happened, I‚Äôd be thinking of him for the next twelve thousand years, and I really didn‚Äôt need that right now. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm such a mess.‚Äù  
  
¬† I shook my head as I slid the door open. The knot returned with a vengeance the moment I spotted her behind the stainless-steel counter, standing where Dad used to until he passed away from the widow-maker‚Äîa massive, undetected morning heart attack.  
  
¬† Forgetting about the dread I‚Äôd felt the whole long-as-hell drive up here and what I‚Äôd heard on the radio, I felt like I was five again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMom,‚Äù I croaked, dropping the bag on the floor.  
  
¬† Anne Keeton stepped out from behind the counter, and I stumbled in the rush to get to her. It had been a year since I‚Äôd seen her. Last Christmas, she had traveled to Atlanta, because she‚Äôd known I wasn‚Äôt ready to come home then. Only a year had passed, but Mom had changed just as much as the inn had.  
  
¬† Her shoulder-length hair was more silver than blond. Deeper lines had forged into the skin around her brown eyes, and fine lines had formed around thinner lips. Mom had always been curvy‚Äîafter all, that was where I got my hips and breasts, and belly, and, okay, thighs from‚Äîbut she was at least twenty pounds lighter.  
  
¬† Concern blossomed in the pit of my stomach as she wrapped her arms around me. Had I not noticed this last year? Had I been gone too long? Ten years was a long time to miss things when you only saw someone sporadically.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHoney,‚Äù Mom said, her voice thick. ‚ÄúBaby, I‚Äôm so happy to see you. So happy that you‚Äôre here.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù I whispered back, and I meant it.  
  
¬† Coming home had been the last thing I wanted to do, but as I hugged her tight and inhaled the vanilla scent of her perfume, I knew it had been the right thing, because that concern grew and spread throughout me.  
  
¬† Mom was only fifty-five, but age didn‚Äôt matter when it came to mortality. Nothing did when it came to death. I knew that better than anyone. Dad had died young, and ten years ago, at nineteen, I had . . . I had almost taken my last breath after everything else had been taken from me.  
  
¬† Chapter 2  
  
¬† The iron bistro table in front of the large window overlooking the veranda and garden had been in the kitchen as long as I could remember. Smoothing my hand over the surface, I found the tiny, familiar indentations carved around the edges. It was at this very table where I colored as a child and did homework in the evenings as a teenager.  
  
¬† The door to the old kitchen, which now served as a break room/storage room, was on the opposite end, also marked with an employees-only sign. That door, like everything else in the updated kitchen, had been painted a fresh white.  
  
¬† Mom brought two cups of coffee over and sat across from me. The room now smelled like a coffee store, and I wasn‚Äôt thinking about the way I‚Äôd freaked out before.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said, wrapping my hand around the warm cup. A grin tipped up the corners of my lips. Little green Christmas trees decorated the cup. Even though it was two weeks past Christmas and all the decorations were down, the Christmas-themed coffee cups would remain out and in use all year. Glancing around the kitchen, I frowned and asked, ‚ÄúWhere is James?‚Äù James Jordan had been the chef for at least fifteen years. ‚ÄúI smell something cooking.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat you smell is two roasts.‚Äù She took a sip of her coffee. ‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs been some changes. Guests have to notify us by one if they will be having dinner here and then we cook the dinner based on that request. It cuts down on the work and we‚Äôre not wasting as much food.‚Äù She paused. ‚ÄúJames comes in just three times a week now. Tuesd  
ay, Thursday, and Saturday.‚Äù She lowered her cup to the table. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still pretty steady with business, but with the newer hotels springing up around here every year, I have to be careful with what we‚Äôre spending money on. Do you remember me telling you about Angela Reidy?

When I nodded, she continued, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs our main housekeeping staff in the mornings and afternoons Wednesday through Sunday, and Daphne is still here, but she‚Äôs getting up there in age, so I‚Äôve moved her to part-time. That gives her more time with her grandbabies. Angela is amazing, but a little flighty and sometimes forgetful. She is always locking herself out of the townhouse she rents, so much so that she keeps a spare key in the back room.‚Äù  
  
¬† I let all of that sink in as I took a drink of the sugary coffee, just the way I loved it. Basically what Mom was saying was that she was doing most of this all by herself. That explained the deeper lines around her eyes, the new ones around her mouth, and the silvery tones to her blond hair. Running an inn or any business with a skeleton crew would take its toll on anyone, and I knew that the last ten years hadn‚Äôt been easy on her for a whole different set of reasons.  
  
¬† The same reasons they‚Äôd been hard for me.  
  
¬† Sometimes, not often, I was able to forget what had driven me away from my home. Those moments were few and far between, but when they happened, it was . . . the warmest sense of peace I‚Äôd ever felt. It was like the way it was before. Like I could pretend I was an ordinary woman with a career I sort of loved and a past that was common, boring even. It wasn‚Äôt that I hadn‚Äôt come to terms with everything that had happened . . . to my family and me. I had six years of intensive therapy to thank for that, but I still welcomed those moments when I forgot, and I was grateful for them.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been doing all of this by yourself, Mom.‚Äù I placed my cup on the table and crossed my leg over my knee. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a lot.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs . . . manageable.‚Äù Mom smiled, but it didn‚Äôt reach her whiskey-colored eyes. Eyes identical to mine. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre home now. I won‚Äôt be doing this by myself.‚Äù  
  
¬† I nodded as my gaze dropped to the cup. ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve come home‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say it.‚Äù Mom reached across the small table and folded her hand over mine. ‚ÄúYou had a very good job‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy job was to basically babysit my boss to make sure he didn‚Äôt cheat on his third wife.‚Äù I paused, grinning. ‚ÄúObviously, I wasn‚Äôt very good at it since number three is on her way out.‚Äù  
  
¬† She shook her head as she lifted her cup. ‚ÄúHoney, you were an executive assistant for a man who ran a multibillion-dollar consulting business. You had more responsibilities than making sure he kept it in his pants.‚Äù  
  
¬† I giggled.  
  
¬† The only thing that rivaled my former boss‚Äô drive when it came to business was his drive to screw as many women as humanly possible. But what she said was true. Late nights at the office; dinner meetings; and a constant, ever-changing schedule with nonstop flights coast to coast and around the globe had been my life for five years. It had its pros and cons, and leaving my job hadn‚Äôt been a decision I‚Äôd made lightly. But my job had allowed me to save up some money that would make this transition into a much . . . slower life a little easier.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou had a life in Atlanta,‚Äù she continued, and I raised a brow. My time had basically been Mr. Berg‚Äôs time. ‚ÄúAnd your life back here wasn‚Äôt easy to return to.‚Äù  
  
¬† I tensed. She wasn‚Äôt going to go there, was she? She squeezed my hand.  
  
¬† She was so going to go there.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis town and all the memories weren‚Äôt easy for you to come back to, and I know that, honey. I know that.‚Äù She smiled again, but it was brittle. ‚ÄúSo I understand how big of a deal this was for you. What you had to overcome just to make the decision to do this, and you‚Äôre doing it for me. Don‚Äôt belittle what you‚Äôre doing right now.‚Äù  
  
¬† Oh God, I was going to start crying again.  
  
¬† Yes, I was doing this for her, but I was . . . I was also doing it for myself.  
  
¬† I slipped my hand free and nearly gulped down the coffee before I burst into tears and face-planted onto the iron table like I‚Äôd done way too many times in the past.  
  
¬† She sat back. ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she said, clearing her throat. ‚ÄúSeveral boxes of your stuff arrived on Wednesday, and James put them upstairs for you. I imagine you still have some stuff in the car?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I murmured as she rose and carried her cup to the industrial sink. ‚ÄúI can get those boxes up there. It‚Äôs only clothes, and I could use the exercise after being in the car for a million hours.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou might change your mind after you remember how many steps you have to climb.‚Äù She washed out the cup. ‚ÄúWe only have three guests right now, two of them checking out on Sunday, and then others‚Äîa newlywed couple‚Äîare checking out on Tuesday.‚Äù  
  
¬† I finished off the coffee. ‚ÄúWhat about upcoming reservations?‚Äù  
  
¬† Wiping her hands off on a dishtowel, Mom rattled off what was expected for the next week, and I loved that she could remember that.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs there anything I can help you with right now?‚Äù I asked when she was finished.  
  
¬† She shook her head. ‚ÄúTwo out of the three reservations are dining here. The roasts still have some time on them. The potatoes are already boiled and cut, ready to go. If you want to help serve dinner, we still have about two hours.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSounds good.‚Äù I started to rise. Movement out of the corner of my eyes snagged my attention.  
  
¬† Turning toward the window, I caught a blur of shadows to the right of the veranda. Branches from the dwarf apple tree rustled. My eyes narrowed as I leaned closer to the window. Something moved behind the trellis that was normally covered with vines, a shadow deeper than the rest and keeping close to the hedges. I waited for someone to step out, but when that didn‚Äôt happen, my gaze tracked over the garden. Not seeing anything, I returned my attention to the veranda. The chaise lounge and other seats out on the veranda were empty, but I‚Äôd sworn I‚Äôd seen someone outside.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you looking at, honey?‚Äù  
  
¬† Having no idea, I blinked and shook my head as I twisted toward her. ‚ÄúI think one of the guests is outside.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStrange.‚Äù She moved behind the hanging pots and walked toward the oven. ‚ÄúNone of the guests are actually here. I believe they‚Äôre all out.‚Äù  
  
¬† I turned back to the window as Mom picked up an oven mitt.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOf course, one of them could‚Äôve snuck past me,‚Äù she said, and the creak of the oven door opening filled the kitchen. ‚ÄúThat has been known to happen.‚Äù  
  
¬† Nothing moved outside.  
  
¬† There probably hadn‚Äôt even been anyone outside. Just nerves. And paranoia. Like before, when I ran into the house and all the way upstairs. Being back home had me on edge and I liked to think no one would blame me for that.  
  
¬† Worrying my lower lip, I thought back to the newscast I‚Äôd heard on the radio. My stomach twisted as I clasped my hands together. ‚ÄúI heard something on the radio, about a missing woman in Frederick.‚Äù  
  
¬† Mom stopped halfway to the wall oven. Our eyes met, and when she said nothing, knots formed and wiggled in my belly like a hundred tiny snakes. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you say anything?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† Focused on the oven, she slipped the mitt on. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want you to worry, and I know you‚Äôd try not to, but I didn‚Äôt want to upset you.‚Äù She gave a little shake of her head. ‚ÄúAnd I didn‚Äôt want you to change your mind about coming home.‚Äù  
  
¬† I inhaled softly. Did she think I was that fragile? That a missing woman in a nearby state would change my mind? Right after everything had happened I would‚Äôve been that frail. I would‚Äôve broken all over again, but I wasn‚Äôt her anymore.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat is happening with that woman is terrible, but you know what they say. Most cases of disappearances are caused by someone the person knows,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúProbably the husband.‚Äù  
  
¬† Except when it happened to me it wasn‚Äôt from someone I knew. It was a stranger, someone I never saw coming until it was too late.  
  
¬† Hours later, after I helped serve dinner to the cute elderly couple staying on the third floor and the family of three who were from Kentucky and visiting relatives, I stood in the middle of my new apartment.  
  
¬† God, it felt so weird being back here.  
  
¬† Same but different.  
  
¬† Dinner service had gone fine, but it was odd doing  
something that felt like second nature even though I hadn‚Äôt done it in years. In a bizarre way, it was a lot like being an executive assistant. Just like with Mr. Berg, I had to anticipate things that would be needed. These were just different things. Like when the diners needed their drinks refilled or a plate removed.  
  
¬† Cleanup still sucked, just like I remembered.  
  
¬† But I didn‚Äôt think as I cleared off the tables and rinsed the dishes before placing them in the dishwasher while Mom completed the turndown service. My mind was blissfully empty up until the moment I headed upstairs.  
  
¬† The attic had been converted into two and a half apartments. Dad had passed away before the third had been completed, and it remained untouched behind closed doors, separating the two apartments. I wasn‚Äôt sure if the third would ever be finished, and if it was, what its purpose would be. Wasn‚Äôt like I was going to need the space anytime soon.  
  
¬† Or ever.  
  
¬† Absently, my right hand floated to my left, and I rubbed my ring finger. Even after leaving this town and spending six years with a therapist, I didn‚Äôt think that I would ever be able to wear a wedding dress or allow anyone to put a ring on my hand.  
  
¬† My therapist said that could change, but I seriously doubted it. I couldn‚Äôt even bring myself to go to my former boss‚Äô third wedding. The whole thing turned my stomach.  
  
¬† Realizing what I was doing, I dropped my left hand and focused on my apartment.  
  
¬† It wasn‚Äôt quite like I recalled and I suspected Mom had had the area renovated. Or maybe just with all of my grandmother‚Äôs stuff gone, the space seemed larger and fresher. The apartment smelled like pumpkin spice, not musty or old, and it was cute in a comfy, cozy sort of way.  
  
¬† The living area shared space with an open galley-style kitchen that only had a fridge, microwave, and sink. All I needed were barstools for the island. My couch, a thick-cushioned beauty, had been shipped up from Atlanta, along with the necessities. My light gray throw blankets, the soft and warm ones made for cuddling in, were already draped along the back of the couch.  
  
¬† The bedroom was big enough. Small closet, but the bathroom in the narrow hallway between the living room and bedroom featured a soaking tub and shower combo with claw feet that made up for its lack of size.  
  
¬† I spent the rest of the night setting up my apartment, which pretty much meant hooking up the TV and unloading all the clothing‚Äîclothing I now wished I‚Äôd donated, because my biceps ached from all the folding I was doing.  
  
¬† It was well past midnight by the time I wandered into the bathroom to wash my face. Gaze trained on the white basin of the sink as I rubbed in the cleanser, I bent over and splashed warm water onto my cheeks. Blindly grabbing for a towel I thought I saw earlier, I gave mental jazz hands when my fingers brushed the fuzzy cloth. Drying my face off, I straightened and opened my eyes as I lowered the towel.  
  
¬† And came face-to-face with my reflection.  
  
¬† I jerked back a step, bumping into the bathroom door. ‚ÄúDamn,‚Äù I muttered, rolling my eyes. I started to grab for the toothbrush, but I exhaled roughly and did something I hadn‚Äôt done in a very long time.  
  
¬† I looked at myself.  
  
¬† Really looked at myself.  
  
¬† Because it had been ages since I had, and I‚Äôd become so good at not looking at myself that I was a freaking pro at putting makeup on without a mirror. Even eyeliner. Upper eyeliner.  
  
¬† My brown eyes weren‚Äôt dark like Dad‚Äôs. They were warmer and lighter, like Mom‚Äôs. My blond hair was pulled up in a messy topknot, and had been all day, but when it was down, it fell to the middle of my back. My face would‚Äôve fit the classic heart-shape mold if it weren‚Äôt for the square jaw.  
  
¬† Clenching the rim of the basin, I leaned in close to the mirror.  
  
¬† Around about my freshman year of college, I‚Äôd finally grown into my nose and mouth. Or at least that was how it felt to me, because before then, my nose had been huge and my lips plumper than the rest of my face, and contrary to how it sounded, that had not been an attractive combo. Those lips had come from my grandmother. The jaw from Dad. The body and eyes from Mom.  
  
¬† It was my freshman year when I‚Äôd realized that I‚Äôd moved from passably average to blonde-girl-next-door pretty. Right now I thought I looked like the kind of woman who‚Äôd be bringing baked apple pies to the neighbors and currently be working on percolating my third child.  
  
¬† My lips curled up at the corners, and the smile was weak and sad, and a little empty. There were faint shadows under my eyes and a wary glint that never seemed to fade, no matter how many years passed or what I‚Äôd come to terms with.  
  
¬† If I could go back in time, I would‚Äôve told the nineteen-year-old Sasha to live it the hell up. To go to the frat parties I‚Äôd been invited to. To stay out late and wake up even later. To have more confidence in myself. To know what I had when I‚Äôd looked in the mirror.  
  
¬† To take the huge step in the relationship with the boy I‚Äôd met in Econ 101.  
  
¬† Out of everything I regretted not experiencing before . . . before the Groom found me, it was probably that, because he had taken my firsts and twisted them into something revolting and cruel.  
  
¬† Pressing my lips together, I glanced down. Pink toes poked out from the frayed edges of my jeans. I placed my hands on full hips and then slid them up to where my waist tapered in just slightly. What did I look like naked?  
  
¬† I honestly had no idea.  
  
¬† Even with the men I‚Äôd been intimate with in recent years, I really didn‚Äôt check myself out. Actually, come to think of it, I never got fully nude with anyone.  
  
¬† There were reasons for that.  
  
¬† Two of them, to be exact.  
  
¬† Uncomfortable with where my thoughts were traipsing around and about to belly flop into, I stopped feeling myself up. Quickly finishing up in the bathroom, I flipped off the light and walked out.

If you‚Äôre a coffee lover, you know the magic of a good espresso.**

But with so many espresso makers on the market, finding the one that suits your needs can feel overwhelming. You might wonder, ‚ÄúWhat kind of espresso maker is best for me? ‚Äù This decision is crucial‚Äînot just for your morning routine but for crafting those moments of pure coffee bliss.

In this guide, we‚Äôll navigate the maze of espresso machines together, helping you discover the ideal choice that fits your lifestyle and taste preferences. Get ready to elevate your coffee experience to new heights‚Äîlet‚Äôs dive in!

# Types Of Espresso Makers

Choosing the¬†[best espresso maker](https://gomehedi.com/best-espresso-makers/)¬†depends on your needs. Manual machines offer control, while automatic ones provide convenience. Capsule machines are quick and easy for beginners. Each type caters to different preferences and skills. Consider your budget and desired coffee experience when selecting the ideal espresso maker.

When choosing an espresso maker, understanding the different types available can help you find the perfect match for your coffee-making adventures. Each type of machine offers unique features and benefits, making it crucial to consider your preferences and lifestyle. Whether you enjoy the hands-on approach or prefer the convenience of automation, there‚Äôs an espresso maker out there for you. Let‚Äôs dive into the diverse world of espresso machines.

# Manual Espresso Machines

Manual espresso machines are for those who enjoy the art of coffee-making. They require you to control every aspect of the process, from grinding beans to pressing the espresso shot. This hands-on approach can be rewarding, offering a sense of accomplishment when you pull the perfect shot. These machines are often favored by purists who appreciate the traditional espresso experience. They allow you to experiment with grind size, pressure, and water temperature. If you love being involved in crafting your espresso and have the time to fine-tune your skills, a manual machine might be your ideal choice.

# Semi-automatic Machines

Semi-automatic machines strike a balance between control and convenience. They automate some parts of the process, like water temperature and pressure, while allowing you to manually start and stop the extraction. This gives you the flexibility to adjust the shot length and strength according to your taste. These machines are popular among home baristas who want more control than an automatic machine offers but aren‚Äôt ready to commit to a fully manual one. If you enjoy experimenting with your espresso but still want a bit of automation, a semi-automatic machine could be the right fit for you.

# Automatic Machines

Automatic machines simplify the espresso-making process by handling most of the work for you. They come with pre-set options that ensure consistent results every time. With just a push of a button, you can enjoy a delicious espresso without the need to adjust settings manually. For busy individuals or those who prefer convenience without sacrificing quality, an automatic machine is a great option. Imagine waking up and having your espresso ready at the touch of a button‚Äîit‚Äôs perfect for those hectic mornings when every second counts.

I know you have a lot of questions, Chloe,‚Äù Dr. Davidoff said as I sat on the edge of the bed. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here to.........","One  
  
¬† WHEN THE DOOR TO my cell clicked open, the first thought that flitted through my doped-up brain was that Liz had changed her mind and come back. But ghosts don‚Äôt open doors. They will, on occasion, ask me to open one, so I can raise and interrogate the zombies of supernaturals killed by a mad scientist, but they never need one opened for themselves.  
  
¬† I sat up in bed and rubbed my bleary eyes, blinking away the lingering fog of the sedative. For a moment, the door stayed open only a crack. I slid from the bed, tiptoeing across the thick carpet of my fake hotel room, praying the person on the other side had been called away and I could escape before these people started whatever experiments they‚Äôd brought me here to‚Äî  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHello, Chloe. ‚Äù Dr. Davidoff beamed his best kindly-old-man smile as he pushed the door wide. He wasn‚Äôt that old‚Äîmaybe fifty‚Äîbut in a movie, I‚Äôd cast him as the doddering absentminded scientist. It was an act I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd worked on until he got it just right.  
  
¬† The woman behind him had chic blond hair and a New York suit. I‚Äôd cast her as the mother of the nastiest girl in class. Which was cheating, because that‚Äôs exactly who she was. Mother of Victoria‚ÄîTori‚ÄîEnright, the one housemate we‚Äôd left out of our plans when we‚Äôd escaped from Lyle House, and for good cause, considering she was one of the reasons I‚Äôd needed to escape.  
  
¬† Tori‚Äôs mom carried a Macy‚Äôs bag, like she‚Äôd just been out shopping and popped in to conduct a few horrific experiments before heading to lunch.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know you have a lot of questions, Chloe,‚Äù Dr. Davidoff said as I sat on the edge of the bed. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here to answer them for you. We just need a little help from you first. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSimon and Derek,‚Äù Mrs. Enright said. ‚ÄúWhere are they?‚Äù  
  
¬† I looked from her to Dr. Davidoff, who smiled and nodded encouragingly, like he fully expected me to turn in my friends.  
  
¬† I‚Äôd never been an angry kid. I‚Äôd never run away from home. Never stamped my feet and screamed that life was unfair and I wished I‚Äôd never been born. Whenever my dad told me we were moving again and I needed to transfer schools, I‚Äôd swallowed a whiny ‚Äúbut I just made new friends,‚Äù nod, and tell him I understood.  
  
¬† Accept your lot. Count your blessings. Be a big girl.  
  
¬† Now, looking back at a life of doing what I was told, I realized I‚Äôd bought into the game. When adults patted me on the head and told me I was so grown-up, what they really meant was that they were glad I wasn‚Äôt grown-up enough yet to question, to fight back.  
  
¬† Looking at Dr. Davidoff and Mrs. Enright, I thought of what they‚Äôd done to me‚Äîlying to me, locking me up‚Äîand I wanted to stamp my feet. Wanted to scream. But I wasn‚Äôt going to give them that satisfaction.  
  
¬† I widened my eyes as I met Mrs. Enright‚Äôs gaze. ‚ÄúYou mean you haven‚Äôt found them yet?‚Äù  
  
¬† I think she would have slapped me if Dr. Davidoff hadn‚Äôt lifted his hand.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, Chloe, we haven‚Äôt found the boys,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very concerned for Simon‚Äôs safety. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBecause you think Derek might hurt him?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNot intentionally, of course. I know Derek‚Äôs fond of Simon. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Fond? What a strange word to use. Derek and Simon were foster brothers, tighter than any blood brothers I knew. Sure, Derek was a werewolf, but that wolf part of him was what would stop him from ever hurting Simon. He‚Äôd protect him at all costs‚ÄîI‚Äôd already seen that.  
  
¬† My skepticism must have shown on my face, because Dr. Davidoff shook his head, as if disappointed in me. ‚ÄúAll right, Chloe. If you can‚Äôt spare any concern for Simon‚Äôs safety, maybe you can for his health. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúW-what ab-bou‚Äî‚Äù My stutter cropped up most when I was nervous, and I couldn‚Äôt let them know they‚Äôd struck a nerve. So I tried again, slower now. ‚ÄúWhat about his health?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHis condition. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Apparently I wasn‚Äôt the only one who watched too many movies. Now they would tell me that Simon had some rare medical condition and if he didn‚Äôt get his medicine within twelve hours, he‚Äôd spontaneously combust.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat condition?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe has diabetes,‚Äù Dr. Davidoff said. ‚ÄúHis blood sugar levels need to be monitored and regulated. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWith one of those blood testing things?‚Äù I said slowly, thinking back. Simon had always disappeared into the bathroom before meals. I‚Äôd thought he just liked to wash up. I‚Äôd bumped into him once coming out as he‚Äôd been shoving a small black case into his pocket.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right,‚Äù Dr. Davidoff said. ‚ÄúWith proper care, diabetes is easily managed. You weren‚Äôt aware of it because you didn‚Äôt need to be. Simon leads a normal life. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúExcept for one thing,‚Äù Tori‚Äôs mom said.  
  
¬† She reached into the Macy‚Äôs bag and took out a backpack. It looked like Simon‚Äôs, but I wasn‚Äôt falling for that‚Äîthey‚Äôd probably bought a matching one. Sure, she pulled out a hoodie I recognized as Simon‚Äôs, but he‚Äôd left behind a whole closet of clothing at Lyle House. Easy enough to grab stuff from there.  
  
¬† Next came a pad of paper and pouch of colored pencils. Simon‚Äôs room was filled with his comic book sketches. Again, easy enough to‚Äî  
  
¬† Mrs. Enright flipped through the sketch pad, holding up pages. Simon‚Äôs work in progress. He‚Äôd never have left that behind.  
  
¬† Finally, she laid a flashlight on the table. The flashlight from Lyle House‚Äîthe one I‚Äôd watched him put into his bag.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSimon slipped going over the fence,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe had his backpack over one shoulder. It fell. Our people were right behind him so he had to leave it. There‚Äôs something in here that Simon needs much more than clothing and art supplies. ‚Äù  
  
¬† She opened a navy nylon pouch. Inside were two pen-like vials, one filled with cloudy liquid, the other clear. ‚ÄúThe insulin to replace what Simon‚Äôs body can‚Äôt produce. He injects himself with these three times a day. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat happens if he doesn‚Äôt?‚Äù  
  
¬† Dr. Davidoff took over. ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt going to scare you and say that if Simon skips a single shot, he‚Äôll die. He‚Äôs already missed his morning one, and I‚Äôm sure he only feels a bit out of sorts. But by tomorrow, he‚Äôll be vomiting. In about three days, he‚Äôll lapse into a diabetic coma. ‚Äù He took the pouch from Tori‚Äôs mom and set it in front of me. ‚ÄúWe need to get this to Simon. To do that, you need to tell us where he is. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I agreed to try.  
  
¬† Two  
  
¬† IN A GOOD DRAMA, the protagonist never takes the straight line to the prize. She must set out, hit an obstacle, detour around it, hit another, take a longer detour, another obstacle, another detour‚Ä¶. Only when she has built up the strength of character to deserve the prize does she finally succeed.  
  
¬† My story was already fitting the time-honored pattern. Fitting, I guess, for a film student. Or, I should say, former film student. Chloe Saunders, fifteen-year-old Steven Spielberg wannabe, her dreams of writing and directing Hollywood blockbusters shattered on the day she got her first period and started living the kind of life she‚Äôd once imagined putting on the screen.  
  
¬† That‚Äôs when I started seeing ghosts. After freaking out at school, I was taken away by the men in the white jackets and shipped off to a group home for mentally disturbed teens. Problem is, I really did see ghosts. And I wasn‚Äôt the only kid at Lyle House with supernatural powers.  
  
¬† Simon could cast spells. Rae could burn people with her bare fingers. Derek had superhuman strength and senses and, apparently, soon would be able to change into a wolf. Tori‚Ä¶well, I didn‚Äôt know what Tori was‚Äîmaybe just a screwed-up kid put in Lyle House because her mom helped run it.  
  
¬† Simon, Derek, Rae, and I realized it was no coincidence we were in the same place, and we escaped. Rae and I got separated from the guys and, after running to my aunt Lauren‚Äîthe person I had trusted most  
in the world‚ÄîI ended up here, in some kind of laboratory run by the same people who owned Lyle House.  
  
¬† Now they expected me to help them bring in Simon and Derek?  
  
¬† Well, it was time to introduce a few obstacles of my own. So, in the spirit of proper storytelling, I told Dr. Davidoff where to find Simon and Derek.  
  
¬† Step one: establish the goal. ‚ÄúRae and I were supposed to hide while the guys stayed behind to distract you with Simon‚Äôs magic,‚Äù I told Dr. Davidoff. ‚ÄúRae ran on ahead so she didn‚Äôt hear, but at the last second Simon pulled me back and said, if we got separated, we‚Äôd meet at the rendezvous point. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Step two: introduce the obstacle. ‚ÄúWhere is the rendezvous point? That‚Äôs the problem. I don‚Äôt know where it is. We talked about needing one, but everything was so crazy that day. We‚Äôd only just decided to escape, and then Derek was saying it had to be that night. The guys must have picked a rendezvous point, and forgot they never told me where it was. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Step three: map out the detour. ‚ÄúBut I do have some ideas‚Äîplaces we talked about. One of them must be the rendezvous point. I could help you find it. They‚Äôll be looking for me, so they might hide until they see me. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Rather than escape this place, I‚Äôd let them take me out by using me as bait. I‚Äôd list places I‚Äôd never discussed with Simon or Derek, and there would be no chance they‚Äôd get captured. A brilliant plan.  
  
¬† The response?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll keep that in mind, Chloe. But for now, just tell us the locations. We have ways to find the boys once we get there. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Obstacles. An essential part of the storytelling process. But in real life? They suck.  
  
¬† After Dr. Davidoff and Tori‚Äôs mom had gotten my list of fake rendezvous points, they left, giving me nothing in return‚Äîno answers, no clues about why I was here or what would happen to me.  
  
¬† I sat cross-legged on my bed, staring down at the necklace in my hands as if it were a crystal ball that could provide all those answers. My mom had given it to me back when I was seeing ‚Äúbogeymen‚Äù‚Äîghosts, as I now knew. She said the necklace would stop them from coming, and it did. I‚Äôd always figured, like my dad said, that it was psychological. I believed in it, so it worked. Now, I wasn‚Äôt so sure.  
  
¬† Had my mom known I was a necromancer? She must have, if the blood ran in her family. Was the necklace supposed to ward off ghosts? If so, its power must have faded. It even looked faded‚ÄîI swore the bright red jewel had gone a purplish color. One thing it didn‚Äôt do, though, was answer my questions. That I had to do for myself.  
  
¬† I put the necklace back on. Whatever Dr. Davidoff and the others wanted from me, it wasn‚Äôt good. You don‚Äôt lock up kids you want to help.  
  
¬† I certainly wasn‚Äôt going to tell them how to find Simon. If he needed insulin, Derek would get it, even if it meant breaking into a drugstore.  
  
¬† I had to concentrate on getting Rae and me out. But this wasn‚Äôt Lyle House, where the only thing standing between us and freedom was an alarm system. This room might look like it belonged in a nice hotel‚Äîwith a double bed, a carpeted floor, an armchair, desk, and private bathroom‚Äîbut there were no windows and no knob on the inside of the door.  
  
¬† I‚Äôd hoped to get Liz‚Äôs help escaping. My roommate at Lyle House, Liz hadn‚Äôt made it out alive, so when I first got here, I‚Äôd summoned her ghost, hoping she could help me find a way out. Only problem? Liz didn‚Äôt realize she was dead. As gently as I could, I‚Äôd broken the news. She‚Äôd flipped out, accusing me of lying, and disappeared.  
  
¬† Maybe she‚Äôd had enough time to cool off. I doubted it, but I couldn‚Äôt wait. I had to try summoning her again.  
  
¬† Three  
  
¬† I PREPARED FOR A s√©ance. As set pieces went, this one was so lame I‚Äôd never put it in a movie. No sputtering candles to cast eerie shadows on the walls, no moldy skulls forming a ritual circle, no chalices filled with what the audience would suppose was red wine but secretly hope was blood.  
  
¬† Did experienced necromancers use stuff like candles and incense? From the little I‚Äôd learned about the supernatural world, I knew some of what we see in movies is true. Maybe, way back in history, people had known about necromancers and witches and werewolves, and those stories are based, if very loosely, on old truths.  
  
¬† My method‚Äîif I can call it a method since I‚Äôve only used it twice‚Äîcame from trial and error and a few grudging tips from Derek. As a guy who was taking college-level courses at sixteen, being confident of his facts is important to Derek. If he isn‚Äôt sure, he‚Äôd rather keep his mouth shut. But when I‚Äôd pushed him, he‚Äôd told me that he‚Äôd heard that necromancers summoned ghosts either by being at a graveside or by using a personal effect, like Liz‚Äôs hoodie, so I was sitting cross-legged on the carpet, clutching it.  
  
¬† I pictured Liz and imagined myself pulling her out of limbo. At first, I didn‚Äôt try very hard. The last time I‚Äôd focused all my power into summoning a ghost, I‚Äôd summoned two right back into their buried corpses. I wasn‚Äôt near a grave this time, but that didn‚Äôt mean there weren‚Äôt bodies around somewhere. So I kept the voltage low at first, gradually ramping it up, focusing harder and harder until‚Ä¶  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat the‚Äî? Hey, who are you?‚Äù  
  
¬† My eyes flew open. There stood a dark-haired boy about my age with the build, looks, and arrogant chin tilt of a star quarterback. Finding the ghost of another teenager in this place wasn‚Äôt a coincidence. A name popped into my head‚Äîthat of another Lyle House resident who‚Äôd been taken away before I arrived, supposedly transferred to a mental hospital, like Liz.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBrady?‚Äù I said tentatively.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, but I don‚Äôt know you. Or this place. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He pivoted, scanning the room, then rubbed the back of his neck. I stopped myself before asking if he was okay. Of course he wasn‚Äôt okay. He was dead. Like Liz. I swallowed.  
What happened to you?‚Äù I asked softly.  
  
¬† He jumped, as if startled by my voice.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIs someone else here?‚Äù I asked, hoping he sensed Liz, beyond the pale where I couldn‚Äôt see her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI thought I heard‚Ä¶‚Äù He studied me, frowning. ‚ÄúYou brought me here?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt mean to. But‚Ä¶since you are here, can you tell me‚Äî?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNothing. I can‚Äôt tell you anything. ‚Äù He squared his shoulders. ‚ÄúWhatever you want to talk about, I‚Äôm not interested. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He looked away, determined not to be interested. When he started to fade, I was ready to let him go. Rest in peace. Then I thought about Rae and Simon and Derek. If I didn‚Äôt get some answers, we might all join Brady in the afterlife.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Chloe,‚Äù I said quickly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a friend of Rae‚Äôs. From Lyle House. I was there with her, after you‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† He kept fading.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWait!‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI c-can prove it. Back at Lyle House. You tried getting into a fight with Derek, and Simon shoved you away. Only he didn‚Äôt touch you. He used magic. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMagic?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt was a spell that knocks people back. Simon‚Äôs a sorcerer. All the kids in Lyle House‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI knew it. I knew it. ‚Äù He swore under his breath as he rematerialized. ‚ÄúAll that time, they kept trying to shove their diagnosis down my throat, and I told them where else they could shove it, but I couldn‚Äôt prove anything. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou told the nurses what happened with Simon, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNurses?‚Äù He snorted. ‚ÄúGlorified security guards. I wanted to speak to the real boss: Davidoff. They took me to see him at this other place, looked like a warehouse. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I described what I‚Äôd seen of this building when we‚Äôd arrived.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs it. They took me inside and‚Ä¶‚Äù His face screwed up in thought. ‚ÄúA woman came to talk to me. A blonde. Said she was a doctor. Bellows? Fellows?‚Äù  
  
¬† Aunt Lauren. My heart battered my rib cage. ‚ÄúSo this woman, Dr. Fellows‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShe wanted me to say Derek started the fight. That he threatened me, punched me, shoved me, whatever. I considered it. A little payback for all the attitude I had to put up with from that jerk. I‚Äôd just been goofing around with him when Simon got all up in my face and smacked me with that spell. ‚Äù  
  
¬† In the version I‚Äôd heard, Brady had been the one getting in Derek‚Äôs face. Simon had a good reason for interfering, too‚Äîthe last time Derek took a swing, he‚Äôd broken a kid‚Äôs back.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo Dr. Fellows wanted you to say Derek started the fight‚Ä¶. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôd have to deal with the fallout when I went back to Lyle House and I didn‚Äôt need that grief. That‚Äôs when Davidoff came in. He hauled her out of the room, but I could still hear him chewing her out in the hall. She kept saying Derek was a menace and the only reason Davidoff kept him was because he couldn‚Äôt admit he made a mistake by including Derek‚Äôs type. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúType?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIn the experiment. ‚Äù  
  
¬† A chill settled in my gut. ‚ÄúEx-experiment?‚Äù  
  
¬† Brady shrugged. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all she said. Davidoff told her to shove off. He said he made a mistake with the others, but Derek was different. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Others? Did he mean other werewolves? Or other subjects in this experiment? Was I a subject in this experiment?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid they say any‚Äî?‚Äù I began.  
  
¬† His head whipped to the side, as if seeing something out of the corner of his eye.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I asked.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you hear that?‚Äù  
  
¬† I listened. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhispering. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt could be Liz. She‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† Brady went rigid. His eyes rolled. Then his head flew back, the tendons in his neck popping out, bones crackling. His throat convulsed and he gurgled. Instinctively I reached out to help. My hands passed through him, but I could feel the heat of his body, a scorching heat that made me fall back in surprise.  
  
¬† As I recovered, Brady went still again. His chin lowered and he rolled his shoulders, as if working out the kinks. Then he looked down at me. His dark eyes were now a glowing yellowish-orange. The chill in my gut slunk up my spine.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúFrightened, child?‚Äù The voice coming out of Brady‚Äôs mouth was a woman‚Äôs, so high and light it was almost girlish. ‚ÄúYour instincts are excellent, but you have nothing to fear from me. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúW-where‚Äôs Brady?‚Äù  
  
¬† She looked down at the body she was possessing. ‚ÄúDo you like him? He is pretty, isn‚Äôt he? All of dear Dr. Lyle‚Äôs creations are so very pretty. Perfect balls of perfect energy, waiting to explode. ‚Äù  
  
¬† In a blink, ‚ÄúBrady‚Äù was in front of me, his face coming down to mine, bathing me in scorching hot breath that smelled strangely sweet. Those orange eyes met mine, the pupils slitted like a cat‚Äôs.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe boy can‚Äôt help you, child. But I can. You just need to‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† Her eyes rolled back, darkening to Brady‚Äôs brown, then back to orange as she snarled.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre pulling him back to the other side. Call me, child. Quickly. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúC-call‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCall me forth. I can‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† Her eyes rolled again, her snarl deepening into something inhuman, a sound that made the chill in my veins harden to ice. I stepped back and smacked into the wall.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCall me forth,‚Äù she said, voice going ragged, deepening into Brady‚Äôs. ‚ÄúI can answer all your questions. Call me‚Äî‚Äù  
  
¬† Brady‚Äôs image wavered, then popped, like a TV screen after the power cord is pulled. One flash of white light and he was gone. I thought I heard a knock at the door but couldn‚Äôt move, just stared at the spot where Brady had been.  
  
¬† The door opened, and Dr. Davidoff stepped in to find me plastered to the wall.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúChloe?‚Äù  
  
¬† I staggered forward, rubbing my arms.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúChloe?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúS-spider,‚Äù I said, pointing to the bed. ‚ÄúIt r-ran under there. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Dr. Davidoff struggled against a smile. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôll get someone to take care of it, while we‚Äôre gone. We‚Äôre going to go for a walk. It‚Äôs time you got a proper tour and a proper explanation. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Four  
  
¬† AS I FOLLOWED DR. Davidoff down the hall, I tried to shake off thoughts of whatever had been in my room. I was a necromancer: ghosts were my one and only specialty. So it had to be a ghost, no matter how strongly every instinct in me insisted it wasn‚Äôt. All I knew for sure was that I was in no hurry to go back in there.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNow, Chloe‚Äî‚Äù Dr. Davidoff stopped, noticing me rubbing the lingering goose bumps on my arms. ‚ÄúCold? I‚Äôll have them turn up the heat in your room. Your comfort is important to us. ‚Äù  
  
¬† We started walking again.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBut comfort isn‚Äôt just physical, is it?‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúEqually important, perhaps even more, is mental comfort. A sense of security. I know you‚Äôre upset and confused, and it didn‚Äôt help when we refused to answer your questions. We were eager to start checking those places you listed. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He hadn‚Äôt been gone long enough to visit spots miles away. I knew what he‚Äôd really been checking: whether Rae corroborated my story. She would. She didn‚Äôt know the real rendezvous point, only that I‚Äôd said the guys would meet up with us.  
  
¬† Dr. Davidoff opened a door at the end of the hall. It was a security station, the wall lined with flat-screen monitors. Inside, a young man spun in his chair, like he‚Äôd been caught surfing porn sites.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go grab a coffee, Rob,‚Äù Dr. Davidoff said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll take over. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He turned to me as the guard left. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be seeing more of the building later. For now‚Äù‚Äîhe waved at the screens‚Äî‚Äúconsider this the one-stop tour. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Did he think I was stupid? I knew what he was really doing: showing me how well guarded this place was, in case I was planning another escape. But he was also giving me a chance to study what I was up against.  
<  
br /> ¬† ‚ÄúAs you can see, there‚Äôs no camera in your room,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúnor in any of the bedrooms. Just in the hallway. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Two hall cameras, one at each end. I scanned the other screens. Some flipped between cameras, giving multiple angles of halls and entryways. Two showed laboratories, both empty, the lights dim, probably because it was Sunday.  
  
¬† An older model monitor was propped on the desk, cords every which way, like it had been quickly set up. The tiny picture screen was black-and-white and showed what looked like a storage room, all the boxes shoved along the walls. I could see the back of a girl in a beanbag chair.  
  
¬† She was slumped, sneakers stretched next to a game console, long curls spilling over the beanbag, the controller held between dark hands. It looked like Rae. Or maybe it was an impostor set up to convince me that she was okay, playing games, not locked up, screaming for‚Äî  
  
¬† The girl in the chair reached for her Diet 7UP and I saw her face. Rae.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, as Rae has informed us, that GameCube is terribly outdated. But once we promised to replace it with the latest model, she resigned herself to playing it. ‚Äù  
  
¬† As he spoke, his eyes never left the screen. The expression on his face was‚Ä¶fond. Weirdly, the very word he‚Äôd used earlier for Derek seemed to fit here.  
  
¬† When he turned to me, his expression rearranged itself, as if to say I like you well enough, Chloe, but you‚Äôre no Rachelle. And I felt‚Ä¶bewildered. Maybe even a little hurt, like there was still part of me that wanted to please.  
  
¬† He waved at the screen. ‚ÄúAs you can see, we weren‚Äôt prepared to have you kids with us here, but we‚Äôre adjusting. While it will never be as cozy as Lyle House, the five of you will be comfortable here, perhaps more so, with all those unfortunate misrepresentations corrected. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Five of us? That must mean he didn‚Äôt plan to put Derek ‚Äúdown like a rabid dog,‚Äù as Aunt Lauren wanted. I breathed a soft sigh of relief.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt apologize, Chloe,‚Äù Dr. Davidoff continued. ‚ÄúPerhaps I should, but we thought setting up Lyle House was the best way to handle the situation. ‚Äù  
  
¬† He waved me to a chair. There were two, the one the security guard had vacated and a second, pushed against the wall. As I stepped toward the second one, it rolled from the shadows and stopped right in front of me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs not a ghost,‚Äù Dr. Davidoff said. ‚ÄúThey can‚Äôt move objects in our world‚Äîunless they happen to be a very specific kind, namely the ghost of an Agito. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúA what?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAgito. It‚Äôs Latin roughly translating to ‚Äòput into motion. ‚Äô Half-demons come in many types, as you‚Äôll discover. An Agito‚Äôs power, as the name might suggest, is telekinesis. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMoving things with the mind. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúVery good. And it is an Agito who moved that chair, though one who is still very much alive. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou?‚Äù  
  
¬† He smiled and, for a second, the mask of the doddering old fool cracked, and I caught a glimpse of the real man beneath. What I saw was pride and arrogance, like a classmate flashing his A+ paper as if to say top that.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm a supernatural, as is almost everyone who works here. I know what you must have been thinking‚Äîthat we‚Äôre humans who‚Äôve discovered your powers and wish to destroy what we don‚Äôt understand, like in those comic books. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe X-Men. ‚Äù  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt know what was more shocking, that Dr. Davidoff and his colleagues were supernaturals or the image of this stooped, awkward man reading X-Men. Had he pored over them as a boy, imagining himself in Xavier‚Äôs School for Gifted Youngsters?  
  
¬† Did that mean Aunt Lauren was a necromancer? That she saw ghosts, too?  
  
¬† He continued before I could ask anything. ‚ÄúThe Edison Group was founded by supernaturals eighty years ago. And as much as it has grown since those early days, it‚Äôs still an institution run by supernaturals and for supernaturals, dedicated to bettering the lives of our kind. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEdison Group?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNamed after Thomas Edison. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThe guy who invented the lightbulb?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what he‚Äôs best known for. He also invented the movie projector, which I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre grateful for. Yet you, Chloe, have accomplished something he dreamed of but never succeeded in doing. ‚Äù A dramatic pause. ‚ÄúContacting the dead. ‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThomas Edison wanted to talk to the dead?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe believed in an afterlife and wanted to communicate with it not through s√©ances and spiritualism but through science. When he died, it‚Äôs thought he was working on just such a device‚Äîa telephone to the afterlife. No plans for it were ever found. ‚Äù Dr. Davidoff smiled conspiratorially. ‚ÄúOr, at least, not officially. We adopted the name because, like Edison, we take a scientific approach to matters of the paranormal. ‚Äù  
  
¬† Improving supernatural lives through science. Where had I heard something like that? It took me a moment to remember, and when I did, I shivered.  
  
¬† The ghosts I‚Äôd raised in the Lyle House basement had been subjects of experiments by a sorcerer named Samuel Lyle. Willing subjects, at first, they‚Äôd said, because they‚Äôd been promised a better life. Instead, they‚Äôd ended up lab rats sacrificed to the vision of a madman, as one ghost had put it. And that thing in my room had called Brady‚Äîand me, I think‚ÄîSamuel Lyle‚Äôs ‚Äúcreations.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúChloe?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúS-sorry. I‚Äôm just‚Äî  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTired, I imagine, after being up all night. Would you like a rest?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, I-I‚Äôm fine. It‚Äôs just‚ÄîSo how do we fit in? And Lyle House? It‚Äôs part of an experiment, isn‚Äôt it?",1,1754192717.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
1mg9ezz,https://i.redd.it/lu6anau27qgf1.jpeg,Orange you glad etoupe is a neutral?,"Buckle up friends, this is a long one! 

I figured that I was done for the year, checked myself into a penthouse suite on ban island and everything. Apparently my SA had other plans and I subconsciously manifested my way into what I *think* is really my last bag for the year. 

I got a text from my SA asking me to pop in and see them this weekend, I figured my housewares and RTW order was here. So silly me, dragged my husband out for brunch and a drive by to pick up. When we got there we puttered around while SA was wrapping up with a big group that had walked in. We headed downstairs after and caught up on what was new, how we were doing etc. my husband always has a coffee when we come in, so they said let‚Äôs go into the room because ‚Äúwe got the cute sugars in!‚Äù Apparently people are insane with these and the cookies and take advantage of them, aka grab handfuls to take home. 

I thought it was weird, but weirder things have happened. So I‚Äôm sitting there sipping on my water and eyeing the cute sugars, when they walk in with some boxes. We unbox the plates, the bowls, the cups, etc. Finally, they ask if there was anything else I wanted to look at today. I asked about rodeo/pegasus which there were none. I asked about fruit plates, but we‚Äôre still waiting those to come in. So I say, nope! I‚Äôm ready. But SA is still staring at me with the widest grin on their face. 

They get up and start to open a box‚Ä¶ and out comes a B25 in Etoupe. The color I‚Äôve always been on the fence with, the color that I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want, the color all my friends and everyone goes crazy for‚Ä¶ the bag I apparently didn‚Äôt know I wanted. I *did* however know that I wanted a B25 eventually, so in preparation for the tariffs, I bought some bag insets and pillows for things I knew I would eventually have on my wishlist or already had in my closet. So in that order‚Ä¶ I bought a B25 pillow and insert that have been tucked away, until that bag came into my life.  

So, I‚Äôm officially done for the year, I‚Äôve hit all bag maxes for the year and I told my SA I‚Äôll see them around Christmas and I‚Äôm checking back onto ban island ü§£. Their response was a wink‚Ä¶ not sure where that will go, but we‚Äôll see lol!

My journey so far has been bumpy, included an SA change, frustration and plenty of bags and fun times. If anyone has any questions, outside of ‚Äúwhat was your exact prespend‚Äù, please let me know and I‚Äôm happy to share what knowledge I have.

I‚Äôm not here for drama or boring small talk. I‚Äôd love to meet a woman who‚Äôs into fun, relaxed dates and real conversations the kind where we can talk about anything, from random memories to things we don‚Äôt usually share out loud.

I enjoy both the simple stuff like coffee dates or latenight drives and also the deeper, more intimate moments that happen when two people truly vibe. I believe emotional connection and attraction can go hand in hand.

1mg9dt8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mg9dt8,The 5 Non-Negotiable Numbers Every Founder Needs to Know BEFORE Breakfast,"It‚Äôs 7 AM. The coffee is brewing. Before the first email is opened, before the first Slack notification pings, before the day‚Äôs chaos truly begins, the most successful founders in the world have already checked the pulse of their business.

They‚Äôre not diving into a 50-tab spreadsheet or a dense accounting report. They‚Äôre looking at a handful of numbers. Five, to be exact.

I remember a client, let‚Äôs call her Sarah, a brilliant founder of a subscription box company. She was passionate, her product was fantastic, and her customer feedback was glowing. But she was perpetually stressed. She was working 80-hour weeks, sales were coming in, yet she always felt like she was on the verge of financial collapse. Why? She was drowning in data but starved for wisdom. She was tracking everything and therefore, knew nothing.

Her ""aha!"" moment came when we cut through the noise. We ignored the vanity metrics and focused on a few core indicators. We boiled down the complex world of **Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A)** into a simple, daily habit. This shift didn't just lower her anxiety; it transformed her decision-making and, ultimately, saved her business.

You don‚Äôt need an MBA to be a financially savvy founder. You just need to know what to look at. These five non-negotiable **business metrics** are your daily health check. They are your compass, your early-warning system, and your key to unlocking sustainable growth. Know them before breakfast, and you‚Äôll own the rest of your day.

# 1. Cash Runway: Your Oxygen Tank

**What it is:** In the simplest terms, **Cash Runway** is how many months your business can survive before you run out of money, assuming your current income and expenses stay the same.

**Why it‚Äôs non-negotiable:** Cash is the oxygen for your business. When you run out, everything else dies. Sales, marketing, product development‚Äînone of it matters if you can‚Äôt pay your bills. Knowing your runway isn‚Äôt about being pessimistic; it‚Äôs about being a realist. It tells you when you need to raise funds, cut costs, or push harder on sales. It turns panic into a plan.

**How to calculate it:** `Cash Runway (in months) = Current Cash Balance / Monthly Net Burn Rate`

Your ""Net Burn"" is the total amount of money you're losing each month. `Net Burn = Monthly Revenue - Monthly Expenses`

**Example in Action:** Let‚Äôs say you run a small graphic design agency.

* **Current Cash in the Bank:** $60,000
* **Average Monthly Revenue:** $20,000
* **Total Monthly Expenses (salaries, software, rent, etc.):** $25,000

Your **Monthly Net Burn** is $20,000 - $25,000 = -$5,000. You're losing $5,000 per month. Your **Cash Runway** is $60,000 / $5,000 = 12 months.

You have one year of oxygen. This single number is one of the most powerful **KPIs** you can have. It tells you that you have 12 months to either increase your revenue by $5,000 a month or cut costs to become profitable. You can now make strategic decisions, not desperate ones.

**Best Practices:**

* **Check it weekly, know it daily.** This number can change fast. A big new client or an unexpected expense can alter your runway overnight.
* **Be brutally honest with expenses.** Don't forget taxes, credit card fees, or that software subscription you barely use.
* **Aim for at least 6-12 months of runway.** This gives you room to breathe and navigate unforeseen challenges. For early-stage startups, 18 months is often the goal.

# 2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): Your Growth Engine's Fuel Cost

**What it is:** **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** is the total cost of sales and marketing to acquire a single new paying customer over a specific period.

**Why it‚Äôs non-negotiable:** Any business can get customers by throwing enough money at the problem. But is that growth profitable? Is it sustainable? Your CAC tells you exactly how much you have to spend to get one person to buy from you. If this number is too high, you could be selling your way into bankruptcy.

**How to calculate it:** `CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Costs / Number of New Customers Acquired`

**Example in Action:** Imagine you own a local coffee shop. Last month, you tried a new marketing push.

* **Facebook Ad Spend:** $500
* **Flyer Printing & Distribution:** $200
* **Time spent on marketing (your hourly rate):** 5 hours at $40/hr = $200
* **Total Sales & Marketing Costs:** $500 + $200 + $200 = $900

Through these efforts, you can directly attribute **90 new customers** who used a special offer code from the ads and flyers. Your **CAC** is $900 / 90 = $10.

It costs you $10 to get a new person to walk in and make their first purchase. Is that good or bad? You can't know without the next metric.

**Best Practices:**

* **Track by channel.** What‚Äôs the CAC for customers from Google Ads vs. Instagram vs. trade shows? This tells you where to double down and what to cut.
* **Include** ***all*** **costs.** Don‚Äôt forget salaries of your marketing team, software tools (e.g., Mailchimp, HubSpot), and even the cost of ""free"" trials if applicable.
* **Constantly test and optimize.** The goal is to lower your CAC over time by finding more efficient ways to reach your ideal customer.

# 3. Lifetime Value (LTV): Is Your Growth Profitable?

**What it is:** **Lifetime Value (LTV)**, sometimes called Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), is the total revenue you can reasonably expect from a single customer throughout their entire relationship with your business.

**Why it‚Äôs non-negotiable:** LTV is the other half of the growth equation. It tells you what a customer is *worth* to you. When you compare your LTV to your CAC, you get a crystal-clear picture of your business model's viability. A healthy business has an LTV that is significantly higher than its CAC.

**How to calculate it:** There are complex ways, but here‚Äôs a simple, powerful one: `LTV = Average Purchase Value x Average Purchase Frequency x Average Customer Lifespan`

**Example in Action:** Let's go back to our coffee shop with its $10 CAC.

* The **Average Purchase Value** (average spend per visit) is $7.
* The **Average Purchase Frequency** is that a loyal customer comes in 3 times a month.
* The **Average Customer Lifespan** is that you tend to keep a customer for about 2 years (24 months).

Your **LTV** is $7 x 3 purchases/month x 24 months = $504.

Now for the magic: The **LTV to CAC Ratio**. Your ratio is $504 (LTV) to $10 (CAC), or roughly 50:1. This is incredibly healthy! It means for every $10 you spend to get a new customer, you can expect to get over $500 back. You should be running those ads all day long.

If your CAC was $300? Your ratio would be less than 2:1. That‚Äôs a red flag. You're paying too much for customers who aren't worth enough to you over time.

**Best Practices:**

* **A 3:1 LTV to CAC ratio is considered a good benchmark.** Less than that, and you're likely losing money. Much more than that, and you might be under-investing in marketing and growing too slowly.
* **Focus on increasing LTV.** It's often cheaper to get current customers to spend more than to acquire new ones. Focus on great service, loyalty programs, and upselling to boost this number.
* **Segment your customers.** Your LTV might be different for different types of customers. Identify your most valuable segment and find more people like them.

# 4. Gross Margin: The Health of Your Core Offer

**What it is:** **Gross Margin** reveals the profitability of your core product or service itself, before any overhead or operating expenses are taken out. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs left over from a sale after subtracting the direct costs of creating and delivering that product or service.

**Why it‚Äôs non-negotiable:** This metric tells you if your fundamental business model works. If you have a low gross margin, it means the very thing you sell isn't generating enough profit to support the rest of the business (like marketing, rent, and your own salary). No amount of sales volume can fix a fundamentally broken gross margin.

**How to calculate it:** First, find your Gross Profit: `Gross Profit = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)` Then, your Gross Margin: `Gross Margin (%) = (Gross Profit / Revenue) x 100`

**COGS** includes the direct costs to produce what you sell. For a product, it's materials and direct labor. For a service, it's the direct labor cost of the people delivering the service.

**Example in Action:** Let's look at a small, independent software (SaaS) business.

* **Monthly Subscription Revenue:** $30,000
* **COGS:** This includes server hosting costs ($2,000), third-party API fees ($500), and the portion of customer support salaries directly serving existing customers ($2,500). Total COGS = $5,000.

**Gross Profit** = $30,000 - $5,000 = $25,000 **Gross Margin** = ($25,000 / $30,000) x 100 = 83.3%

This is a very healthy gross margin, typical for software. It means that for every dollar in sales, 83 cents are available to pay for operating costs (like new feature development, marketing, admin) and, eventually, become net profit. If this number were 20%, the business would be in serious trouble.

**Best Practices:**

* **Know your industry benchmark.** A 10% gross margin might be great for a grocery store, but it would be catastrophic for a consulting firm.
* **Track it over time.** A declining gross margin is a major red flag. It could mean your supplier costs are rising, or you're discounting too heavily.
* **Look for ways to improve it.** Can you negotiate better prices with suppliers? Can you make your service delivery more efficient? Can you raise your prices?

# 5. Your One Key Metric (OKM): Your North Star

**What it is:** This isn't a universal financial metric like the others. It's the one **business metric** that, more than anything else, tells you if you are delivering value to your customers. It‚Äôs often activity-based, not financial. It‚Äôs your ""North Star.""

**Why it‚Äôs non-negotiable:** The first four numbers tell you about the health of your business engine. This number tells you if your car is actually *going* somewhere your passengers want to be. A focus on an OKM aligns your entire team around a single, clear goal: creating happy, engaged customers. When your OKM goes up, your financial metrics will eventually follow.

**Examples in Action:**

* For **Facebook** in the early days, it was ""the number of users who add 7 friends in their first 10 days."" They knew this action created sticky, long-term users.
* For **Airbnb**, it‚Äôs ""nights booked."" This captures value for both hosts and guests.
* For a **SaaS company**, it might be ""Daily Active Users"" or ""Number of Invoices Created.""
* For our **subscription box company**, it could be ""monthly retention rate.""
* For our **coffee shop**, it could be ""number of loyalty card sign-ups per week.""

**How to find yours:** Ask yourself this question: **What is the single action that best represents a user getting value from my product or service?** The answer is your OKM.

**Best Practices:**

* **Make it visible.** Put your OKM on a dashboard, a whiteboard, or in a company-wide email. Everyone should know the score.
* **Focus your team on it.** When planning a new feature or marketing campaign, ask, ""How will this move our One Key Metric?""
* **Don't be afraid to change it.** As your business evolves, your North Star might shift. That's okay. The key is to always have one.

# From Numbers to Ritual

Knowing these five numbers is only half the battle. The real magic happens when you build a ritual around them. You don't need fancy software. A simple whiteboard or a locked Google Sheet will do.

Every morning, before the world pulls you in a million directions, take five minutes.

1. Look at your **Cash Runway**. *Are we safe?*
2. Look at your **LTV:CAC ratio**. *Is our growth profitable?*
3. Look at your **Gross Margin**. *Is our core offering healthy?*
4. Look at your **One Key Metric**. *Are we delivering value?*

Answering these questions daily transforms you from a reactive firefighter into a proactive architect of your business. It simplifies the complex, focuses your energy, and gives you the confidence to make the bold decisions that will truly move the needle. Stop drowning. Start swimming. Your future self will thank you for it.

¬† PROSPERITY  
  
¬† Kate Harker hit the ground running.  
  
¬† Blood dripped from a shallow cut on her calf, and her lungs were sore from the blow she‚Äôd taken to the chest. Thank God for armor, even if it was makeshift.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTurn right.‚Äù  
  
¬† Her boots slid on the slick pavement as she rounded the corner onto a side street. She swore when she saw it was full of people, restaurant canopies up and tables out despite the brewing storm.  
  
¬† Teo‚Äôs voice rose in her ear. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs catching up.‚Äù  
  
¬† Kate backtracked and took off down the main road. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want a mass casualty event, find me somewhere else.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHalf a block, then cut right,‚Äù said Bea, and Kate felt like the avatar in some multiplayer game where a girl was chased by monsters through a massive city. Only this massive city was real‚Äîthe capital at the heart of Prosperity‚Äîand so were the monsters. Well, monster. She‚Äôd taken out one, but a second was heading her way.  
  
¬† The shadows wicked around her as she ran. A chill twisted through the damp night and fat drops of rain dripped under her collar and down her back.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLeft up ahead,‚Äù instructed Bea, and Kate bolted past a row of shops and down an alley, leaving a trail of fear and blood like bread crumbs in her wake. She reached a narrow lot and a wall, only it wasn‚Äôt a wall, but a warehouse door, and for a split second she was back in the abandoned building in the Waste, cuffed to a bar in a blacked-out room while somewhere beyond the door, metal struck bone and someone‚Äî  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLeft.‚Äù  
  
¬† Kate blinked the memory away as Bea repeated her instruction. But she was sick of running, and the door was ajar, so she went straight, out of the rain and into the vacant space.  
  
¬† There were no windows in the warehouse, no light at all save that from the street behind her, which reached only a few feet‚Äîthe rest of the steel structure was plunged into solid black. Kate‚Äôs pulse pounded in her head as she cracked a glorified glow stick‚ÄîLiam‚Äôs idea‚Äîand tossed it into the shadows, flooding the warehouse with steady white light.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúKate . . . ,‚Äù chimed in Riley for the first time. ‚ÄúBe careful.‚Äù  
  
¬† She snorted. Count on Riley to give useless advice. She scanned the warehouse, spotted crates piled within reach of the steel rafters overhead, and started to climb, hauling herself the last of the way up just as the door rattled on its hinges.  
  
¬† Kate froze.  
  
¬† She held her breath as fingers‚Äînot flesh and bone, but something else‚Äîcurled around the door and slid it open.  
  
¬† Static sounded in her good ear.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStatus?‚Äù asked Liam nervously.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBusy,‚Äù she hissed, balancing on the rafters as the monster filled the doorway, and for an instant, Kate imagined Sloan‚Äôs red eyes, his shining fangs, his dark suit.  
  
¬† Come out, little Katherine, he‚Äôd say. Let‚Äôs play a game.  
  
¬† The sweat on her skin chilled, but it was just her mind playing tricks on her‚Äîthe creature edging forward into the warehouse wasn‚Äôt a Malchai. It was something else entirely.  
  
¬† It had a Malchai‚Äôs red eyes, yes, and a Corsai‚Äôs sharp claws, but its skin was the bluish black of a rotting corpse, and it wasn‚Äôt after flesh or blood.  
  
¬† It fed on hearts.  
  
¬† Kate didn‚Äôt know why she‚Äôd assumed the monsters would be the same. Verity had its triad, but here she had only come across a single kind. So far.  
  
¬† Then again, Verity boasted the highest crime rate of all ten territories‚Äîthanks in large part, she was sure, to her father‚Äîwhile Prosperity‚Äôs sins were harder to place. On the books, Prosperity was the wealthiest territory by half, but it was a robust economy rotting from the inside out.  
  
¬† If Verity‚Äôs sins were knives, quick and vicious, then Prosperity‚Äôs were poison. Slow, insidious, but just as deadly. And when the violence began to coalesce into something tangible, something monstrous, it didn‚Äôt happen all at once, as in Verity, but in a drip, slow enoug  
h that most of the city was still pretending the monsters weren‚Äôt real.  
  
¬† The thing in the warehouse suggested otherwise.  
  
¬† The monster inhaled, as though trying to smell her, a chilling reminder of which of them was the predator and which, for the moment, was prey. Fear scraped along her spine as its head swung from side to side. And then it looked up. At her.  
  
¬† Kate didn‚Äôt wait.  
  
¬† She dropped down, catching herself on the steel rafter to ease the fall. She landed in a crouch between the monster and the warehouse door, spikes flashing in her hands, each the length of her forearm and filed to a vicious point.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLooking for me?‚Äù  
  
¬† The creature turned, flashing two dozen blue-black teeth in a feral grimace.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúKate?‚Äù pressed Teo. ‚ÄúYou see it?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù she said dryly. ‚ÄúI see it.‚Äù  
  
¬† Bea and Liam both started talking, but Kate tapped her ear and the voices dropped out, replaced a second later by a strong beat, a heavy bass. The music filled her head, drowning out her fear and her doubt and her pulse and every other useless thing.  
  
¬† The monster curled its long fingers, and Kate braced herself‚Äîthe first one had tried to punch right through her chest (she‚Äôd have the bruises to prove it). But the attack didn‚Äôt come.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù she chided, her voice lost beneath the beat. ‚ÄúIs my heart not good enough?‚Äù  
  
¬† She had wondered, briefly, in the beginning, if the crimes written on her soul would somehow make her less appetizing.  
  
¬† Apparently not.  
  
¬† A second later, the monster lunged.  
  
¬† Kate was always surprised to discover that monsters were fast.  
  
¬† No matter how big.  
  
¬† No matter how ugly.  
  
¬† She dodged back, quick on her feet.  
  
¬† Five years‚Äô and six private schools‚Äô worth of self-defense had given her a head start, but the last six months hunting down things that went bump in Prosperity‚Äîthat had been the real education.  
  
¬† She danced between blows, trying to avoid the monster‚Äôs claws and get under its guard.  
  
¬† Nails raked the air above Kate‚Äôs head as she ducked and slashed the iron spike across the creature‚Äôs outstretched hand.  
  
¬† It snarled and swung at her, recoiling only after its claws bit into her sleeve and hit copper mesh beneath. The armor absorbed most of the damage, but Kate still hissed as somewhere on her arm the skin parted and blood welled up.  
  
¬† She let out a curse and drove her boot into the creature‚Äôs chest.  
  
¬† It was twice her size, made of hunger and gore and God knew what else, but the sole of her shoe was plated with iron, and the creature went staggering backward, clawing at itself as the pure metal burned away a stretch of mottled flesh, exposing the thick membrane that shielded its heart.  
  
¬† Bull‚Äôs-eye.  
  
¬† Kate launched herself forward, aiming for the still-sizzling mark. The spike punched through cartilage and muscle before sinking easily into that vital core.  
  
¬† Funny, she thought, that even monsters had fragile hearts.  
  
¬† Her momentum carried her forward, and the monster fell back, and they went down together, its body collapsing beneath her into a mound of gore and rot. Kate staggered to her feet, holding her breath against the noxious fumes until she reached the warehouse door. She slumped against it, pressing a palm to the gash on her arm.  
  
¬† The song was ending in her ear, and she switched the feed back to Control.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow long has it been?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe have to do something.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù  
  
¬† A string of profanity.  
  
¬† A few stock lines of relief.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStatus?‚Äù asked Bea.  
  
¬† Kate pulled the cell from her pocket, snapped a photo of the gory slick on the concrete, and hit SEND.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù answered Bea.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWicked,‚Äù said Liam.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLooks fake,‚Äù offered Teo.  
  
¬† Riley sounded queasy. ‚ÄúDo they always . . . fall apart?‚Äù  
  
¬† The litany in her ear was just another reminder that these people had no business being on this end of the fight. They had their purpose, but they weren‚Äôt like her. Weren‚Äôt hunters.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow about you, Kate?‚Äù asked Riley. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù  
  
¬† Blood soaked her calf and dripped from her fingers, and truth be told, she felt a little dizzy, but Riley was human‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt have to tell him the truth.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPeachy,‚Äù she said, killing the call before any of them could hear the catch in her breath. The glow stick flickered and faded, plunging her back into the dark.  
  
¬† But she didn‚Äôt mind.  
  
¬† It was empty now.  
  
¬† Kate climbed the stairs, leaving drops of gray water in her wake. The rain had started up again halfway back to the apartment, and she‚Äôd relished the soaking despite the cold, letting it wash away the worst of the black blood and gore.  
  
¬† Even so, she still looked like she‚Äôd gotten in a fight with a jar of ink‚Äîand lost.  
  
¬† She reached the third-floor landing and let herself in.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHoney, I‚Äôm home.‚Äù  
  
¬† No answer, of course. She was crashing in Riley‚Äôs apartment‚Äîan apartment his parents paid for‚Äîwhile he was off ‚Äúliving in sin‚Äù with his boyfriend, Malcolm. She remembered seeing the place for the first time‚Äîthe exposed brick, the art, the overstuffed furniture designed for comfort‚Äîand thinking Riley‚Äôs parents clearly shopped in a different catalog than Callum Harker.  
  
¬† She‚Äôd never lived alone before.  
  
¬† The school dorms had always been two-to-a-room, and back at Harker Hall, she‚Äôd had her father, at least in theory. And his shadow, Sloan. She‚Äôd always assumed she‚Äôd relish the eventual privacy, the freedom, but it turned out that being alone lost some of its charm when you didn‚Äôt have a choice.  
  
¬† She smothered the wave of self-pity before it could crest and headed for the bathroom, peeling off her armor as she went. Armor was a pretty fancy word for the copper mesh stretched over paintball gear, but Liam‚Äôs combined interests in costume design and war games did the job . . . 90 percent of the time. The other 10, well, that was just sharp claws and bad luck.  
  
¬† She caught her reflection in the bathroom mirror‚Äîdamp blond hair slicked back, black gore freckling pale cheeks‚Äîand met her own gaze.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù she murmured, wondering how other Kates in other lives were spending their night. She‚Äôd always liked the idea that there was a different you for every choice you made and every choice you didn‚Äôt, and somewhere out there were Kates who had never returned to Verity and never begged to leave.  
  
¬† Ones who could still hear out of both ears and had two parents instead of none.  
  
¬† Ones who hadn‚Äôt run, hadn‚Äôt killed, hadn‚Äôt lost everything.  
  
¬† Where are you?  
  
¬† Once upon a time, the first image in her head would have been the house beyond the Waste, with its high grass and its wide-open sky. Now it was the woods behind Colton, an apple in her hand and birdsong overhead, and a boy who wasn‚Äôt a boy with his back against a tree.  
  
¬† She turned the shower on, wincing as she peeled away the last of the fabric.  
  
¬† Steam bloomed across the glass, and she bit back a groan as hot water struck raw skin. She leaned against the tiles and thought of another city, another house, another shower.  
  
¬† A monster slumped in the bath.  
  
¬† A boy burning from the inside out.  
  
¬† Her hand wrapped around his.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm not going to let you fall.  
  
¬† As the scalding water ran gray and rust red and then finally clear, she considered her skin. She was becoming a patchwork of scars. From the teardrop in the corner of her eye and the pale line that ran from temple to jaw‚Äîmarks of the car crash that had killed her mother‚Äîto the curve of a Malchai‚Äôs teeth along her shoulder and the silvery gash of a Corsai‚Äôs claws across her ribs.  
  
¬† And then there was the mark she couldn‚Äôt see.  
  
¬† The one she‚Äôd made herself when she raised her father‚Äôs gun and pulled the trigger and killed a stranger, staining her soul red.  
  
¬† Kate sna  
pped the water off.  
  
¬† As she taped up her latest cuts, she wondered if, somewhere, there was a version of herself having fun. Feet up on the back of a theater seat while movie monsters slunk out of the shadows, and people in the audience screamed because it was fun to be afraid when you knew you were safe.  
  
¬† It shouldn‚Äôt make her feel better, imagining those other lives, but it did. One of those paths led to happiness, even while Kate‚Äôs own had led her here.  
  
¬† But here, she told herself, was exactly where she was supposed to be.  
  
¬† She‚Äôd spent five years trying to become the daughter her father wanted‚Äîstrong, hard, monstrous‚Äîonly to learn that her father didn‚Äôt want her at all.  
  
¬† But he was dead, and Kate wasn‚Äôt, and she‚Äôd had to find something to do, someone to be, some way to put all those skills to use.  
  
¬† And she knew it wasn‚Äôt enough‚Äîno matter how many monsters she slayed, it wouldn‚Äôt undo the one she‚Äôd made, wouldn‚Äôt erase the red from her soul‚Äîbut life only moved forward.  
  
¬† And here in Prosperity, Kate had found a purpose, a point, and now when she met her gaze in the mirror, she didn‚Äôt see a girl who was sad or lonely or lost. She saw a girl who wasn‚Äôt afraid of the dark.  
  
¬† She saw a girl who hunted monsters.  
  
¬† And she was damn good at it.  
  
¬† Hunger gnawed at Kate‚Äôs bones, but she was too tired to go in search of food. She turned the radio up and slumped onto the couch, sighing at the simple comfort of clean hair and a soft sweatshirt.  
  
¬† She‚Äôd never been all that sentimental, but living out of a duffel bag taught you to value the things you had. The sweatshirt was from Leighton, the third of her six boarding schools. She had no fondness for the school itself, but the sweatshirt was worn and warm, a little piece of a past life. She didn‚Äôt let herself cling to these pieces, holding on just tight enough that they wouldn‚Äôt slip away. Besides, the Leighton colors were forest green and cool gray, way better than St. Agnes‚Äôs horror show of red and purple and brown.  
  
¬† She booted up her tablet and logged into the private chat space Bea had carved out in the infinite world of Prosperity‚Äôs opendrive.  
  
¬† Welcome to the Wardens, said the screen.That was the name they‚Äôd chosen for themselves‚ÄîLiam and Bea and Teo‚Äîbefore Kate ever showed up. Riley hadn‚Äôt been a part of it, either‚Äînot until she brought him in.  
  
¬† LiamonMe: hahahahahahaha wolves  
  
¬† TeoMuchtoHandle: it‚Äôs a cover-up. everyone knows what happened in verity.  
  
¬† Beatch: See no evil ‚Üí hear no evil ‚Üí tell yourself there‚Äôs no evil  
  
¬† LiamonMe: dunno I had a mean-ass cat once  
  
¬† For a moment, Kate just stared at the screen and asked herself for the hundredth time what she was doing here, talking to these people. Letting them in. She hated that part of her craved this simple contact, even looked forward to it.  
  
¬† RiledUp: Did you guys catch that headline about the explosion on Broad?  
  
¬† Kate hadn‚Äôt gone looking for friends‚Äîshe‚Äôd never played well with others, never stayed in a school long enough to make any real connections.  
  
¬† RiledUp: Guy walked into his apartment, pulled the gas line straight out of the wall.  
  
¬† Sure, Kate understood the value of friends, the social currency of being part of a group, but she‚Äôd never gotten the emotional appeal. Friends wanted you to be honest. Friends wanted you to share. Friends wanted you to listen and care and worry and do a dozen other things Kate had no time for.  
  
¬† All she‚Äôd wanted was a lead.  
  
¬† RiledUp: Roommate was home when it happened.  
  
¬† Kate had landed in Prosperity six months ago with that one duffel, five hundred in cash, and a bad feeling that got worse with every piece of news. Dog attacks. Gang violence. Suspicious activity. Brutal acts. Suspects at large. Crime scenes disturbed. Weapons missing.  
  
¬† LiamonMe: Creepy.  
  
¬† Beatch: Downer, Riley.  
  
¬† A dozen stories all sporting the telltale signs‚Äîthe kind made by teeth and claws‚Äîand then there were the whispers on the opendrive, referencing the same place, the name scraping over skin: Verity.  
  
¬† But short of putting an EAT ME sign on her back and wandering the streets at night, Kate wasn‚Äôt exactly sure where to start. Finding monsters had never been a problem in Verity, but here, for every actual sighting there were a hundred trolls and conspiracy theorists co-opting the threads. It was a needle in a haystack where a bunch of idiots were shouting, SOMETHING POKED ME.  
  
¬† But there, threaded through the static, she noticed them. The same voices showing up over and over, trying to be heard. They called themselves the Wardens, and they weren‚Äôt hunters, but hackers‚Äîhacktivists, according to Liam‚Äîconvinced that the authorities were either incompetent or determined to bury the news.  
  
¬† The Wardens scoured sites and dug through footage, flagging anything that looked suspicious, then leaked the data to the press and plastered it on the threads, trying to get someone to listen.  
  
¬† And Kate had.  
  
¬† She‚Äôd taken one of their leads and run with it, and when it had panned out, she‚Äôd gone to the source for more. And that‚Äôs when she‚Äôd learned that the Wardens were just a couple of college students and a fourteen-year-old who never slept.  
  
¬† TeoMuchtoHandle: yeah, that‚Äôs sad. but what does that have to do with Heart Eaters?  
  
¬† Beatch: Since when are we calling them Heart Eaters?  
  
¬† LiamonMe: Since they started eating hearts duh.  
  
¬† She still didn‚Äôt want friends. But despite her best efforts, she was getting to know them. Bea, who was addicted to dark chocolate and wanted to be a research scientist. Teo, who never sat still, even had a treadmill desk in his dorm. Liam, who lived with his grandparents and cared too much for his own good. Riley, whose family would kill him if they knew where he spent his nights.  
  
¬† And what did they know about her?  
  
¬† Nothing but a name, and even that was only half true.  
  
¬† To the Wardens, she was Kate Gallagher, a runaway with a knack for hunting monsters. She kept her first name even though the sound of that one syllable made her jump every time, sure that someone from her past had caught up. But it was all she had left. Her mother was dead. Her father was dead. Sloan was dead. The only one who‚Äôd say her name with any sense of knowing was August, and he was hundreds of miles away in Verity, at the center of a city on fire.  
  
¬† Beatch: Makes a hell of a lot more sense than Corsai, Malchai, Sunai. Who named those?  
  
¬† TeoMuchtoHandle: no idea.  
  
¬† Beatch: Your lack of professional curiosity is maddening.  
  
¬† The Wardens had nagged Kate for months to meet up in person, and when the time came she‚Äôd almost bailed. She‚Äôd watched them from across the street, all looking so . . . normal. Not that they blended in‚ÄîTeo had short blue hair and Bea had a full sleeve of tattoos and Liam, in his giant orange glasses, looked like he was twelve‚Äîbut they didn‚Äôt look like something spit out of Verity. They weren‚Äôt Flynn Task Force soldiers. Or coddled Colton kids. They were just‚Äînormal. They had lives outside this one. Things to lose.  
  
¬† LiamonMe: Why not just call them what they are, what they do? Body Eaters, Blood Eaters, and Soul Eaters. BAM.  
  
¬† Kate pictured August down in the subway, dark lashes fluttering as he raised his violin, the music pouring out where bow met strings, transfigured into threads of burning light. Calling him a Soul Eater was like calling the sun bright. Technically accurate, but only a fraction of the truth.  
  
¬† RiledUp: Any sign of Kate?  
  
¬† She switched from incognito to public.  
  
¬† HunterK has joined the chat.  
  
¬† Beatch: Heyo!  
  
¬† TeoMuchToHandle: stalker.  
  
¬† RiledUp: I was getting worried.  
  
¬† LiamOnMe: Not me!  
  
¬† Beatch: Yeah right, Mr. I-know-karate.  
  
¬† Kate‚Äôs fingers danced over the screen.  
  
¬† HunterK: No need. Still standing.  
  
¬† RiledUp: You really shouldn‚Äôt go dark without properly signing off.  
  
¬† TeoMuchToHandle: oooh, riley‚Äôs in dad mode.  
  
¬† Dad mode.  
  
¬† Kate thought of her own father, the cuffs of his suit stained with blood, the sea of monsters at his feet, the smug look on his face right before she put a bullet in his leg.  
  
¬† But she knew what Teo meant‚ÄîRiley wasn‚Äôt like the rest of the Wardens. He wouldn‚Äôt even be there if it wasn‚Äôt for her. He was a grad student, studying law at the university and interning at the local police department, which was the part that mattered to the Wardens, since it meant access to police surveillance and intel briefings‚Äînot that Teo couldn‚Äôt hack them, as he‚Äôd pointed out a dozen times, but why kick down an open door?  
  
¬† (According to Riley, the police were ‚Äúaware of the attacks and continuing to monitor developments,‚Äù which as far as Kate could tell was just a long way of describing denial.)  
  
¬† RiledUp: \*makes dad face\* \*wags finger\*  
  
¬† RiledUp: But seriously. You better not get any blood on my couch.  
  
¬† HunterK: Don‚Äôt worry.  
  
¬† HunterK: I left most of it on the stairs.  
  
¬† LiamOnMe: O\_O.  
  
¬† HunterK: Any new leads?  
  
¬† TeoMuchtoHandle: nothing yet. the streets are quiet.  
  
¬† What a strange idea.  
  
¬† If she could keep this up, knocking out the Heart Eaters as they took shape instead of cleaning up the wreckage, two steps forward instead of back, maybe it wouldn‚Äôt get worse. Maybe she could keep it from becoming a Phenomenon. Maybe‚Äîwhat a useless word. Maybe was just a way of saying she didn‚Äôt know.  
  
¬† And Kate hated not knowing.  
  
¬† She closed the browser, fingers hesitating over the darkened screen before she opened a new window and started searching for Verity.  
  
¬† Kate had first learned how to tap into foreign signals at her second boarding school, out on the eastern fringe of Verity, an hour from the Temperance border.  
  
¬† All ten territories were supposed to transmit openly, but if you wanted to know what was really going on in another territory, you had to slip behind the digital curtain.  
  
¬† That was the idea‚Äîbut no matter how hard Kate looked, she couldn‚Äôt find her way home.  
  
¬† True, the quarantine had gone back into effect, the borders that had peeled open so slowly over the last decade slamming shut again. But there was no curta  
in to slip behind, nothing coming out of Verity at all.  
  
¬† The signal was gone.  
  
¬† There was only one explanation: the tech towers must have gone down.  
  
¬† With the borders closed and the comm grid out, Verity was officially cut off.  
  
¬† And the people in Prosperity didn‚Äôt care. Not even the Wardens‚ÄîTeo had used the word inevitable. Bea thought the borders should never have been opened, that Verity should have been left to consume itself like a fire in a glass jar. Even Riley seemed ambivalent. Only Liam showed the slightest concern, and it was more pity than a vested interest. They didn‚Äôt know, of course, what Verity meant to Kate.  
  
¬† Hell, Kate didn‚Äôt know either.  
  
¬† But she couldn‚Äôt stop searching.  
  
¬† Every night she checked, just in case, clicked through every bread crumb on the opendrive, hoping for some news about Verity, about August Flynn.  
  
¬† It was the weirdest thing‚Äîshe‚Äôd seen August at his worst. Watched him descend through hunger into sickness and madness and shadow. Watched him burn. Watched him kill.  
  
¬† But when she pictured him now, she didn‚Äôt see the Sunai made of smoke or the figure burning in a cold tub. She saw a sad-eyed boy sitting alone on the bleachers, a violin case at his feet.  
  
¬† Kate shoved the tablet away and slumped back on the couch. She threw an arm over her eyes and let the steady beat of the radio fold around her until she sank down toward sleep.  
  
¬† But then, in the lull between songs, the sound of footsteps echoed in the stairwell. She stilled, turning her good ear toward the door as the steps slowed, stopped.  
  
¬† Kate waited for a knock, but it never came. Instead she heard the sound of a hand on the doorknob, the shudder of the lock as it was tried but held fast. Kate‚Äôs fingers slipped beneath the couch cushion and produced a gun. The same one she‚Äôd used to kill a stranger in her mother‚Äôs house, the same one she‚Äôd used to shoot her father in his office.  
  
¬† A muffled voice sounded beyond the door, followed by the scrape of metal, and Kate leveled the weapon at the door as it swung open.  
  
¬† For a moment, the shape in the doorway was nothing but a shadow, the hall lights tracing the outline of a figure a fraction taller than she was, with round edges and short hair. No red eyes, no sharp teeth, no dark suit. Just Riley, standing there, juggling a box of pizza and a six-pack of soda and a key.  
  
¬† He saw the gun and threw his hands up, dropping the cardboard and the cans and the key ring to the floor. One of the cans exploded, raining soda on the landing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDammit, Kate.‚Äù His voice was strangled.  
  
¬† Kate sighed and set the weapon on the table. ‚ÄúYou should knock.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis is my place,‚Äù he said, retrieving the pizza box and the rest of the soda with shaking hands. ‚ÄúDo you pull the gun on everyone, or just me?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEveryone,‚Äù said Kate, ‚Äúbut for you I left the safety on.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm flattered.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, you know,‚Äù he shot back, ‚Äúchecking on the squatter in my apartment, making sure she didn‚Äôt trash the place.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou wanted to see if I bled on the couch.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd the stairs.‚Äù His gaze flicked from her to the gun on the table and back. ‚ÄúPermission to enter?‚Äù  
  
¬† Kate spread her arms along the back of the couch. ‚ÄúPassword?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI brought pizza.‚Äù  
  
¬† The smell emanating from the box was heavenly. Her stomach growled. ‚ÄúOh, all right,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPermission granted.‚Äù  
  
¬† Rituals were funny things.  
  
¬† People thought of them as either elaborate formulas, magic spells, or compulsions drilled into the subconscious by months or years of repetition.  
  
¬† But really, ritual was just a fancy word for habit. A thing that became easier to do than not do. And habits were simple‚Äîespecially bad ones, like letting people in.  
  
¬† Kate curled up on one side of the couch, Riley on the other, while some late-night talk show host murmured bad jokes on the TV.  
  
¬† He held up one of the cans he‚Äôd dropped. ‚ÄúThis‚Äôll be fun,‚Äù he said, cracking the tab. He cringed in expectation, then sighed with relief when it didn‚Äôt explode.  
  
¬† Kate grabbed a second slice of pizza, trying to hide the pain as the bandages tugged on the skin beneath her sleeve.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt have to do this,‚Äù she said between bites.  
  
¬† He shrugged. ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù  
  
¬† She considered him over the crust of her pizza. Riley was slim, with warm brown eyes, the kind of smile that took over his face, and a savior complex. When he wasn‚Äôt at the university or the police station, he volunteered with at-risk teens.  
  
¬† Was that what she was to him? His latest project?  
  
¬† Kate had been in Prosperity for all of three weeks when their paths crossed. She‚Äôd spent her nights squatting in abandoned buildings, her days nursing cups of coffee in caf√© corners as she scoured the opendrive for clues.  
  
¬† It was only a matter of time before the caf√© kicked her out‚Äîshe hadn‚Äôt bought anything in hours. Still, she didn‚Äôt appreciate it when a guy sat down at her table on the pretense of studying, only to ask her if she needed help.  
  
¬† She‚Äôd had her first run-in with a monster the night before, and it hadn‚Äôt gone well. But considering that the extent of her experience‚Äîschoolroom self-defense aside‚Äîconsisted of executing a bound Malchai in her father‚Äôs basement and nearly getting disemboweled by a Corsai on the subway, she really shouldn‚Äôt have been surprised.  
  
¬† She‚Äôd gotten away with a split lip and a broken nose, but she knew she looked rough.  
  
¬† She told the guy she wasn‚Äôt interested in God, or whatever he was selling, but he didn‚Äôt leave. A few minutes later a fresh cup of coffee appeared in front of her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow did that happen?‚Äù he asked, nodding at her face.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHunting monsters,‚Äù she said, because sometimes the truth was strange enough to make people go away.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh, okay . . . ,‚Äù he said, clearly skeptical. He got to his feet. ‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù  
  
¬† She didn‚Äôt move. ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI have a hot shower, an extra bed. There might even be some food in the fridge.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know you.‚Äù  
  
¬† He held out his hand. ‚ÄúRiley Winters.‚Äù  
  
¬† Kate stared at his open palm. She wasn‚Äôt big on charity, but she was tired and hungry and felt like shit. Besides, if he tried anything unwanted, she was pretty sure she could take him. ‚ÄúKate,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúKate Gallagher.‚Äù  
  
¬† Riley didn‚Äôt try anything‚Äîthanks to the aforementioned boyfriend‚Äîjust gave her a towel and a pillow and, a week later, a key. To this day, she wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what had happened. Maybe she‚Äôd had a concussion. Maybe he was just persuasive.  
  
¬† Kate yawned, tossing the paper plate onto the table beside her gun.  
  
¬† Riley reached for the remote, switching the TV off.  
  
¬† Kate responded by switching the radio on.  
  
¬† Riley shook his head. ‚ÄúWhat did silence ever do to you?‚Äù  
  
¬† He didn‚Äôt know, of course, about the car wreck that had killed her mother and stripped the hearing from her left ear. Didn‚Äôt know that when sound was taken from you, you had to find ways to take it back.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf you want sound,‚Äù said Riley, ‚Äúwe could always talk.‚Äù  
  
¬† Kate sighed. This was his game.  
  
¬† Ply her with food and sugar until she was blissed out on empty calories, and then, invariably, start prying. And the worst part was some masochistic part of her must want it, must relish the fact someone cared enough to ask, because she kept letting him in. Kept ending up here on the couch with empty soda cans and pizza boxes.  
  
¬† Bad habit.  
  
¬† Ritual.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said, and Riley brightened visibly, but if he thought she was going to talk about herself, he was wrong. ‚ÄúWhy did you bring up that explosion?‚Äù  
  
¬† Confusion streaked his face. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOn the chat, you mentioned an explosion. Man-made. Why?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou saw that?‚Äù He sat back. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. The Wardens have got me looking for things that don‚Äôt line up,  
and it caught my eye. . . . It‚Äôs the fifth murder-suicide this week. That‚Äôs really high, even for Prosperity.‚Äù  
  
¬† Kate frowned. ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs some kind of monster?‚Äù  
  
¬† Riley shrugged. ‚ÄúSix months ago, I didn‚Äôt believe in monsters. Now I see them everywhere.‚Äù He shook his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably nothing. Let‚Äôs talk about something else. How are you holding up?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, look at the time,‚Äù she said dryly. ‚ÄúMalcolm‚Äôs going to get jealous.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks for your concern,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut I assure you, our relationship is stable enough to allow for time with friends.‚Äù  
  
¬† Friends.  
  
¬† The word glanced off her ribs, hard enough to leave her winded.  
  
¬† Because she knew a secret: there were two kinds of monsters, the kind that hunted the streets and the kind that lived in your head. She could fight the first, but the second was more dangerous. It was always, always, always a step ahead.  
  
¬† It didn‚Äôt have teeth or claws, didn‚Äôt feed on flesh or blood or hearts.  
  
¬† It simply reminded you of what happened when you let people in.  
  
¬† Behind her eyes, August Flynn stopped fighting, because of her. He collapsed into darkness, because of her. He sacrificed a part of himself‚Äîhis humanity, his light, his soul‚Äîbecause of her.  
  
¬† She could handle her own blood.  
  
¬† She didn‚Äôt need anyone else‚Äôs on her hands.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRule one,‚Äù she said, forcing her voice even, light. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make friends. It never ends well.‚Äù  
  
¬† Riley rolled a soda can between his palms. ‚ÄúBut doesn‚Äôt it get lonely?‚Äù  
  
¬† Kate smiled. It was so easy when you could lie.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Violence¬† has a taste¬† a smell¬† but most of all¬† it has¬† a heat‚Äî¬† the shadow

1mg9app,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mg9app/made_out_with_my_best_friend_while_she_had_a/,Made out with my best friend while she had a boyfriend (who's also one of my close friends) and we stopped talking to each other,"My apologies if I go all over the place, its my first time making this long of a reddit post. (burner account for obvious reasons) Yes, I know I'm a horrible person for doing what I did, but I am genuinely lost on what to do next in this chapter of my life. 

I (23M) have been good friends with a girl who we'll call Andrea (23F) since we were 5 years old. Throughout the years we have of course had our ups and downs in our friendship. We are both different people and would conflict on a good amount of things. But despite our lows, we loved spending time with each other, literally doing absolutely anything. When we were kids, we did kiss here and there in secret, but I blamed it on being a kid so I didn't think it was too deep. Throughout our teenage years and adult years, there were a few periods of time where we wouldn't hang out as much because we were both occupied with our own lives to put it short, but we would still text and call pretty often. When we were 14, she told me that she started seeing this guy named (we'll call him) Daniel (25M). With us being young and being close with each other's families, she would tell her parents that she was going to hang out with me in order to see Daniel. I was cool with doing her that favor because I know how parents feel about their young daughters starting to date. And of course, with me being around the both of them pretty often, I became close friends with Daniel as well.

Both Andrea and Daniel were always around each other throughout these years, me and them became our own little friend group and we called ourselves the Trio. Of course, with us spending a lot of time together going on trips and experiencing new things together, we all became very very close, even though we all still had our differences of course, as normal people do. She even tried to set me up with two or three different girls who didn't end up working out for me.

These two have been together since she was 14 and he was 16, and long story short, Andrea ended up cheating on Daniel twice, once when she was 17, and another when she was 20. I of course supported Daniel throughout these times and told him not to get back together with her. Him however, is a man that is simply too nice and WAY too forgiving. If you were to meet him, you would think he was the kindest and most caring man you ever met in your life. They both came to me for advice during these times, as I was the only close and trusted friend that they both had. With that being said, they rekindled their relationship twice because he forgave her in a sense and did not want to let her go in the end. I thought his decision wasn't fair to himself and I told them both that I didn't want to be involved in their personal relationship issues anymore, mainly because I didn't longer want to be involved in dealing with such a chaotic relationship that wasn't even my own.

They continued seeing other, whether it was an official relationship or not, and we kept on hanging out and being there for other as we got further into our twenties. I was an introvert in my teenage years who doubted himself very heavily, and these two honestly taught me how to be more outgoing and played a good part in molding me into the confident man I am today. They took me to my first ever club and etc. Last year however, things began to change.

Throughout all these years, she would constantly drop hints towards me, calling me attractive, dropping compliments to me, telling me she wishes we weren't extremely close to the point that we were almost like cousins or siblings or something, and touching me in certain ways whenever we were together. I obviously knew what she was doing, and while I was somewhat attracted to all of it, I always acted stupid and ignored the subject whenever it came up, due to the fact that I was nervous to go that far with her specifically and because she had a boyfriend that I was close with as well. And last year, she told me she wanted to start coming to the gym with me because she felt I took my workouts more seriously than her boyfriend did.

I didn't see it as anything bad and so, I took her to the gym with me for about 6-7 months. I work until 4pm, so I would always go to the gym at or after 7pm so I could have time to rest at home beforehand. during these gym days, we would leave the gym at a timeframe of 9pm to 11pm, and we would almost always want to get a post workout meal after or just go hangout somewhere. And during these times, i could tell that we were getting closer, and I was starting to find her more attractive than ever.

One night in April, she hungout with two new friends that she met and on her way home called me at around 11pm to hangout. I told her yeah, why not. I get in her car and we decide to go to a nice beach view we've been to before that's about 40 minutes away from home. We get there and it's just us two all alone. The tension was extremely high since the moment she picked me up and I was obviously holding myself back from doing anything with her for reasons previously mentioned. She ended up getting a small bruise from falling on some rocks and so we went home.

The next night, we're having another random convo on text and she randomly says ""I really need to make with someone"". I was a little high, so I respond with ""Don't we all. Don't wanna be weird but I'd help you out if I could"". She responded with ""You can"". The convo went on with both of us acting surprised at what we just said, and tells me I should have tried last night. We end up facetiming and she tells me that during the night at the beach view, she was also holding back the temptation to kiss me because she didn't know how I would react. We ended up talking in more of a sexual way and decided to meet up the following day.

We hungout the following night, went to target, and got some coffee pretending like nothing ever happened. on the way back to the parking lot where I left my car, she asks about what we were talking about last night. We talk about and she tells me that she wants to do it but she's a little bit hesitant, and not once did either of us mention Daniel's name. She parks in a dark spot of the parking lot, and after some more talking we ended up leaning in and made out for an hour. We got really into it and started touching each other and all that while we were doing it.

Two days later, we hungout with Daniel and some other friends, and after dropping off Daniel, we parked up somewhere, hopped in my backseat, and did more than we did the first time. This relationship continued for about 2 months, where would just do things together from time to time. She would facetime me every night, during my lunch break at work, and we would just talk a lot throughout every single day. We took a trip with some friends and she teased me heavily throughout it, tried to kiss me but pulled back as our lips touched, all while Daniel was a door away in the shower. Same exact thing happened a week later on my birthday trip. That was the last time anything sexual happened between us.

Her and Daniel eventually hit another rough patch in their relationship, leading to them breaking up. She was sad and crying a lot about it, and I was there to comfort her. She said that along with everything, she was also feeling guilty about what she did with me, and how Daniel was completely clueless about it. I also promised her from the beginning of everything that I wasn't gonna let what we were doing ruin our relationship. We kept hanging out after their breakup, and she was starting to get closer with the girls at her new job.

Then about a week ago, we hung out and everything was going fine until we parked up to eat pizza and I nicely asked her why she was being so mean to me recently. She apologized for it and we ended up talking about everything that's been happening the last couple of months. How she feels guilty about how she did all that with me and how Daniel doesn't know a thing about it, and that while she still wants to get back together with him, she still has heavy feelings for me in both a loving and a sexual way, which also led her to cutting off her relationship with Daniel. She partly blamed me for the breakup but I also took accountability in knowing that the both of them were still seeing each other, but that I still went ahead and did all of that. After more talking, she told me she wanted to stop talking for some time, which I obviously did not want to happen because I still care about her heavily as a friend. But we both came to that conclusion and I respected her decision. She ended up doing the same With Daniel the night before.

Two days pass and now I'm hanging out with Daniel and going to the gym with him due to him being sad about the new no contact thing. She then calls me and updates me on how she's feeling, and it ends on a good note. 3 more days pass and she asks if she could pick me up and I say yes. While I was expecting to talk everything out, she kept on telling me that she didn't want to talk. I realized only after that she was most likely trying to do things with me again. With me trying to fix things and her not wanting to talk, we argued about each other's feelings and how we're both handling the situation, and we both ended up going home mad.

Me being mad, I decide to tell Daniel half the truth in saying that she admitted that she likes me in that way and that I don't think he should get back with her. He then tells me that a week after our trip with friends (before my birthday trip) she told HIM that she thinks that I like her and that I was the one that tried to kiss her, which he was afraid to confront me about because he genuinely thinks I would never do anything like that :( Of course, I told him that the truth was that it was the other way around.

It's been a week since that last heated convo with her, and Daniel hasn't been seeing her either. 2 days ago, I broke no contact to wish her a happy birthday and she replies with a thank you. This whole week has obviously been taking a toll on Daniel, but it's also taking a toll on me. She was my best friend, despite all of our differences, she would want to go to places and do things that my main friend group would never want to go to with me. We have a lot of memories together and I really miss the genuine friendship we used to have. I regret ever doing anything sexual with her, because I would still have her by my side if I just simply thought with my head instead of my dick. She has a reputation of always coming back during times of conflict but a part of me is afraid that she won't. I genuinely don't want to lose her, and I want to respect the no contact, but I just want to go back to being the great friends that we once were and put all of this behind us.

What should I do? What CAN I do? How can I go about all of this and not lose her in the process? Please give me all the thoughts you have in the comments, I'll answer any questions as well. This is a hard topic to talk about to many people in my real life, and I just want as much advice as I can get, please.

Of course, this story goes much deeper than all of this, but I could genuinely write a whole book about it, so I of course can't put every single detail into this post.

Hey, AiContentAutomators fam! üôå 

Alright, let‚Äôs get real for a second‚Äîare you feeling stuck in a job that‚Äôs draining more than just your bank account? Maybe you‚Äôre staring at your laptop, thinking, ‚ÄúIs this it? Are my best years getting tucked away in a cubicle?‚Äù üò© We've ALL been there. 

But here‚Äôs the juicy part‚Ä¶what if I told you that you could *actually* turn things around by diving into the world of AI? 

Yes, you heard that right! **Upskilling in AI could be your ticket to a more fulfilling career (and a fatter paycheck).** Here‚Äôs why you should consider making the leap:

- **The Future is Now**: AI isn‚Äôt just some sci-fi dream anymore. It‚Äôs here and shaping industries. You want to catch that wave, right? üåä 

- **Skyrocket Your Earning Potential**: Let‚Äôs face it, the average salary for jobs in AI is nothing to sneeze at. Think of it as your golden ticket. *Cha-ching!* üí∏

- **Flexibility & Freedom**: Many AI roles offer remote work options‚Äîhello, work from anywhere! Your bedroom could transform into your office, a cozy coffee shop, or even a beach!

- **Impactful Work**: You could be part of projects that literally change the world‚Äîhow cool is that? If you crave purpose in your work, this is the way to go.

- **Endless Learning**: AI is evolving faster than I can nail down the perfect Netflix binge‚Äîthere‚Äôs always something new to dive into. If learning is your jam, you‚Äôll love it! üéì 

Now, I know what you‚Äôre thinking: *But where do I even start?* Look, it doesn‚Äôt have to feel overwhelming or like you‚Äôre diving into the deep end without a lifesaver. I stumbled upon this awesome educational program that‚Äôs seriously worth checking out: [Imagine AI Education!](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals) üöÄ

It's laid out in a way that's easy to understand, and they‚Äôre all about hands-on learning. It might be the boost you need to crank up your skills and end the job stagnation.

So, what‚Äôs stopping you? 

Sure, there may be doubts creeping in‚Äî‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm not good enough?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat if it‚Äôs too late for me?‚Äù Trust me, everyone starts somewhere! **Your potential is just waiting to be unlocked.** üí° 

Let‚Äôs get fired up about the possibilities! Life's too short to feel stuck. If you were to take that big leap and dive into AI learning, what‚Äôs the first thing you‚Äôd want to tackle? ü§î

Hey, fellow AiContentAutomators! Can we just take a moment to appreciate the sheer genius of going faceless in the content creation game? üôå Seriously, who needs a face when you have ideas that can shine through without being front and center? It's like being the wizard behind the curtain; all the magic happens, but nobody needs to see your face to know it's there!

So, what‚Äôs the big strategy this week? Buckle up because I‚Äôm about to drop some golden nuggets on how to maximize your growth without showing your mug. 

Here‚Äôs how you can dive into the faceless content world:

1. **Choose Your Niche Wisely**: 
   - Find a niche that lets your personality shine without requiring a personal brand. Think blogs about tech, finance, or even niche hobbies! 
   - Let‚Äôs be real, who would rather watch a faceless deep dive into cryptocurrency than *me* showing off my coffee mug collection? ‚òïÔ∏è

2. **Focus on High-Quality Graphics & Voiceovers**:
   - Invest in tools like Canva or Adobe Creative Suite. Make your visuals pop! üé®
   - Use services like vocal AI to give your content a professional touch without needing to step in front of a camera. 

3. **Leverage Automation Tools**:
   - Seriously, if you‚Äôre not using AI tools for content creation yet, you're missing out! 
   - Check out this helpful guide [here](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals) for amazing resources that will save you time and boost your output. Time is money, my friends!

4. **Engage with Your Audience**:
   - Just because you‚Äôre faceless doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be emotionless. Respond to comments, create polls, or drop behind-the-scenes stories (yeah, chances are people will still love it!). You can connect deeply without showing your face!
   - Plus, who doesn't love a little mystery? ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs behind this awesome content?‚Äù Keep them guessing!

5. **Content Repurposing is a Game Changer**:
   - Take one piece of content and turn it into many. A blog post can become a podcast, a series of social media posts, or even a video (just don‚Äôt show your face!).
   - Remember, variety is key! Keep your audience on their toes. 

Now that we've laid down the basics, let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room: **Saturation**. üêò Isn‚Äôt it always on our minds? The truth is, faceless content is starting to explode. But that only means we need to get *creative* and *quick*. 

The beauty of being faceless is that it gives room for innovation. Don't be afraid to experiment! That's the real fun, right? üéâ

Anyway, what do you all think? Are you as excited about the faceless content revolution as I am? Let‚Äôs brainstorm some ideas together. What‚Äôs YOUR favorite way to create content without stepping into the spotlight?",1,1754191074.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

The run down drug store at the corner. The Italian restaurant that has been run by the same family for who knows how long, yet was a staple in the community. It even looked the same, ten years later. Was that a good thing? The comfort that was often found in things that were familiar. Or, was it a bad omen that the things that drove her from town still existed and returning was a mistake.
Victoria‚Äôs phone vibrated in her pocket, though a glance at her watch told her that it was her mother. Of course it was.

The offer had been made to pick her up from the airport, but there was nothing appealing about being trapped in a moving vehicle with her mom for a 40 minute drive. A drive that led to a destination that wasn‚Äôt even the family home. That had been a stream of contentious texts and calls when she had stated she was renting an apartment instead of ‚Äúcoming home‚Äù. A confrontation only exacerbated by a ten year streak of virtual radio silence.
A streak Victoria was more than happy to continue if circumstances hadn‚Äôt forced her to return home. Or rather, really didn‚Äôt give her much of a choice. 

Her eyes squinted shut as echoes filled her mind. Noises crashing over her with the intention to drown. 

‚ÄúMiss, we‚Äôve arrived,‚Äù the driver called out, pulling her from the temporary nightmare. 
It was just going through the motions as she opened the door and slid out of the car. The driver handed her the suitcase that was in the trunk before she absently tipped the man on her phone. It was just so surreal to be back. Yet, as she looked up at the apartment, a feeling of dread set in. If she walked in now, she would have officially returned to the town she swore she never would. 

Slowly, Victoria‚Äôs gaze drifted towards the coffee shop a block down. That was, perhaps, the one thing she did miss. The Last Bean was the best shop for coffee and other cafe goods, and it was a hill she was willing to die on. If she went there, it would just be visiting. No committing to staying.

Resolved, she found herself walking down the block to the shop, a bell ringing as the door opened. The familiar scent of coffee was dominant in the air, but so was the general welcoming atmosphere. 

‚ÄúWelcome in!‚Äù A voice called, lost to the recess of her mind. She scanned the menu herself, yet, before she could order, there voice called out.

It was familiar, and yet, she couldn‚Äôt place it at the same time. Then again, more insistent, ‚ÄúTori?‚Äù The familiar voice called as she snapped her head towards the deep, resonant voice, ‚ÄúIs that you?‚Äù-
 
‚Äî‚Äî Hello there! If you‚Äôre read this far, I‚Äôm glad this has caught your interest! I‚Äôm a 26, female, looking for a long-term, literate, more realistic roleplay. I‚Äôd like a nice balance between plot and smut here. I‚Äôd love to hear your ideas for this story so we can create something that we both enjoy! However, I like the idea of giving up control when the woman is otherwise very independent in her own life. I‚Äôd also like to incorporate romance and digging into our characters. Especially as there was certainly reasons why my character left and is now back, and yours likely would have gone through changes in the past ten years. But I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts such as who your character is. Someone who had a crush on my character in high school? And old romance? Was your character the reason Tori left? Since I want to keep this collaborative in nature to build a premise, I left some of those reasons vague so we can fill them in.

I asked A.I to describe the transition i feel and here it is, happy reading.

üåÑ ""Whispers of Dawn at Necklace Road""

The stars had danced in silent grace,
Now yield to light, give morning space.
A hush still lingers on the street,
As shadows lift on walking feet.

The lake reflects a golden breath,
Of sun now waking from its rest.
Tree branches stretch like arms in prayer,
Embraced by dawn‚Äôs forgiving air.

One side, the cyclists hum their pace,
Wheels turning time with steady grace.
Joggers glide past in quiet rows,
While on our side, soft laughter flows.

No horns, no rush, no city cries,
Just glints of gold in sleepy skies.
The road, like ribbon gently laid,
Between our steps and calm cascade.

This is the hour of softest change,
Where dreams and daylight rearrange.
From dusky veil to amber hue,
A promise whispered: start anew.

So here we walk, not far, not fast,
Just catching morning as it passed‚Äî
And in this moment, still and wide,
We find the world walks by our side.

1mg8t8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1mg8t8z/heres_jerry/,here's jerry,"i hit my balls on the corner of the street while i was driving my truck down the hill and when i turned around my mom was carjacking a jewish kid but he had a glock so we all started frolicking and then we fell through the earth, ended up with a lion and a tiger fist fighting for 50$ but that was all a mirage because we were actually in the desert dying from dehydration.

but all of a sudden everything disappeared, they all never existed, i'm actually an ant building an apartment complex with a coffee in my hand and a black 20 inch dragon dildo in the other, little did we know, our story was just beginning because after all of that happened, i jumped so high i hit the ISS off of it's course, killed the moon and inhaled the rings of saturn.

anyways, there was this mouse, let's call him larry, he was an engineer but also a man, sometimes he's a woman, anyways, when i woke up this morning, i was floating on a lava pool surrounded by myself and copies of my toes, but they were all burning and so was i, so i skipped the ad, went to sleep and now we're here, eating spaghetti at this fancy mongoose's house.

oh and also, in the beginning, it was the end. BUT, it was also the beginning.
anyways back to jerry, what's he doing, floating in the air going to mcdonalds but i don't exist. 
so after all is said and done, we went back to our place, turned on our individual intergalactic space compters‚Ñ¢ and both started researching the meanings and mechanics of pasta making.
while that was happening, a fancy mongoose opened an otherworldly portal right inside of my head so i did what any sane person would do, i went to the beach, but lo and behold it was actually a trap, it was all a lie, just like the cake.
so here we are now, minding our own business, eating our fancy caviar and counting down from 1000
1000, 999, 998, 997, 996, 995, 994, 993, 992, 991, 990 so on and so forth.
maybe it was all a dream and this whole time we were all just toys in a warehouse waiting to be shipped to our respective stores? who knows? not me.
or do i? maybe, anyways, back to jerry, what's he doing? i guess we'll never know, it is a secret of the universe after all.
so who are you? where are we? maybe i'm just a shadow and you're the light? so anyways, i started shooting, hit a few birds, went to wendy's, TELEPORTATION!







i'm behind you.

alright so, there's a cat, but also a ferret, anyways, i'm looking out the window and who do i see? 
jeffrey dahmer.
i bounce out of bed, make my bed, eat my breakfast, bed cereal‚Ñ¢, go to bed, think of beds.
so after the future went past us, i picked up a slab of dirt, smeared it on the wall to create a portal to p diddy's house, jumped in the air and winked at god, allah and zeus all at the same time.
so anyways jerry was there, but also, transparent so i did what he deserved, polished his head.
maybe it's just a crazy coincidence but i have the same birthday as barack obama.
anyways, let that sink in. 
i shit my pants but that's not the point cause after all, you did too but i scooped it by bluetooth before you could realize.
so tomorrow is yesterday but also wednesday february 16th 1881.
after midnight, you turned into a raccoon with a lust for blood but i'm gay and having sex with an intersex intergalactic intern alien who's also my third grade biology teacher and my long lost blood brother.
so anyways, i started twerking from my fingers after you realized we're all just on a rock floating in space but guess what?
you're dead.



...so, wanna go out sometime? says the mongoose, what will you say?

""i think i'm not ready for a relationship""
how sad, that mongoose was really into you.

anyways back to jerry, what's he doing?
SCANDALOUS!
painting the walls with feces.
anyways i started mastering the art of decoding the universe, larry wanting a part of it so i slinged him across the football field where your mom was having a romantic dinner with you fourth grade teacher, mr smith.
anyways i'm tired, my water bed awaits my return, Zzz...
surprise! we are not done here, see that portal? that's me and you from the future but also, maybe the past, are you ready kids?

so do you think this is all gonna work out, life, death, universe, unemployment, yeast infections?
honestly i'm not convinced, let's asking mindy the godess of truth.
she's not available.
so in 1678, i was a kid, you were an adult, i was you, you were you mom, we both worked in the same factory making tiny little kitchen utensils for rats.
so anyways i spontaneously combusted so you all started using me as a stove to cook my own flesh on.

was this all real?

was it all a dream?

who are we?

your mom.

haha.

anyways in 2072, i'll be dead, heart attack. but, you're still thriving, eating dirt and saying hello to pretty ladies.
but never forget the mongoose, he really wanted your love and you broke his heart.

I love the idea of working in Starbucks since 2014, and the opportunity came up when the company decided to have it in our province. To be honest I'm not that fond of coffee, I like it but not as much as I love it. 

Our support SM gave us an assignment regarding coffee tasting. We need to have coffee tasting in our training store and of course for some proof we need to video and take photos of it.

I was kind of jealous since some of my partners already have an idea about what to do compare to me I don't have any idea.

I was wondering if you could help me on how to start this coffee tasting, I was checking this also to my BT as well but she has no response yet.

Hoping you could all help me with some advices and options on how to start.

First time poster, hello, and sorry for the LONG post. DH and I both enjoy Charlotte's videos and are having some problems figuring out how to handle this issue. We figured maybe the Potato Nation could help! To sum up, my in laws, particularly my MIL, have a pattern of treating me/us disrespectfully, and I'm at the point where either DH needs to have a frank talk with them or I, for my own mental health, want to go low contact. They both have control issues and can be manipulative, and my DH is MILS baby, despite not being the youngest. I'll set up with a bit of a timeline; I‚Äôll be as concise as possible, but it‚Äôs a lot, so bear with me. We‚Äôll call MIL Jane and FIL Steve. DH will be John. They will be known as the Darling family. Just a disclaimer, I do love these people and they're not awful all the time. We have plenty of shallow but pleasant/normal interactions, and I don't believe they're behaving from a place of malice so much as self defense. 

When John and I started seeing each other, he was living with his parents. I didn‚Äôt see Jane for the first several months because any time I came over, she would hide in her craft room. Mind you, we were distance, so I‚Äôd spend entire weekends there without seeing her once. We managed to live in the same city for a bit, and his parents had moved 10 hours away. However, a year into our relationship, he moved in with his parents to attend the school where they were. While he was away, we decided to get married. Here's where the incidents really begin. I began wedding planning. For context, all of my family and most of my friends are either overseas or halfway across the country, and the venue we booked had multiple rooms for them to stay in. BUT. Steve casually told me one day they were going to book extra rooms and turn it into a family reunion/getaway for the Darlings, who ALL live locally. I was surprised, but politely shut it down, which didn't end up mattering because COVID hit again, and we had to change venues and plans. At the time, my Dad was going through some health problems, and we weren't willing to take the risk of him flying over. So John and I talked, and we decided we would elope quietly with just us, our witnesses, officiant, and photographer, and then have a ceremony later where we could celebrate with everyone. Jane and Steve LOST IT. First, they suggested having the wedding as we were planning it with just the Darlings, and have a zoom stream for my family. I wasn't into that, as I wanted to be able to share the day with my family as well, and they had already hosted a surprise wedding shower for me without including or even letting my family know it was happening. Which meant it was the Darlings and then me, and not even any of my friends who do live in the area. They came back with ‚ÄúWell, if it were at your parent‚Äôs place and it was your family there, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd be willing to have the Darlings watch on Zoom.‚Äù I said that wasn‚Äôt true because I wouldn‚Äôt ask John to go through that. I reminded them this was because of my Dad‚Äôs health problems that we didn‚Äôt want him flying, not just on a whim. Then they suggested that we drive out to where my parents lived, halfway across the country. I said I was willing to do that, and then they backtracked and said John's siblings wouldn't be able to afford it. After several days of back and forth, I told them firmly but politely that we were sticking to our elopement plan. Jane spent the next 2 days crying, to the point that Steve took it upon himself to message me and tell me I really should consider letting them attend, even if it was just the two of them. This whole situation was already hard for me, because of COVID our wedding was already looking so different from anything I‚Äôd hoped, and I was already grieving a lot. I again politely but firmly told him plans were going ahead as we had already decided.

(To give more context, despite all their kids being adults, my in-laws are the type of people who think they still have the right to tell their kids how to live. All 4 of their kids don‚Äôt usually say no or set boundaries, so I think this came as a huge shock to them. I honestly doubt any of their kids or other in laws had ever said such a firm no. Jane‚Äôs mom is the exact same way, and so is her sister, so essentially, the Darling family exists to keep those 3 women happy, or no one is happy type thing.)

John supported me in this, but not willingly. I tried to make it clear to everyone that this wasn‚Äôt about excluding anyone, it was simply about trying to make the best choice for everyone with no ideal options. John was trying to convince me to let his parents be there, and it got to a point where we almost broke up. So John told me that he was choosing me over her, and we stayed together and eloped the way we had planned. All that to say, my relationship with my in-laws didn‚Äôt get off to a great start. Now, newer issues.

John‚Äôs parents, especially his mom, visit often, usually for 3 weeks at a time. They have said, and I quote ‚ÄúWhen we‚Äôre visiting, we‚Äôre selfish and do expect everyone to hang out with us all the time, or as often as they can.‚Äù And John, who is very much a people pleaser, and also loves his parents and wants to spend time with them, inevitably ends up spending way more time with them than we agree on beforehand. John is in the military. When he gets deployed, we take the week before and after to be with just us. His parents know this. However, they ‚Äòjust happen‚Äô to come visit before and after EVERY deployment. During one of his first ones, they came to visit, and it was their first time (and last) staying with us. They brought their untrained dog with them and would let her harass our dog and tried to scold our dog for defending herself. They also tried telling us not to swear or smoke. In our own home. So John sent them a polite text asking them to not try to give us rules in our own house, essentially. The things Steve texted back were absolutely disgusting. I have some anaphylactic allergies and at the time had dairy and gluten intolerances. Believe me, I KNOW it sucks. This is important because one of the things he texted John was that we were horrible hosts and they had to bend over backwards with providing special food every time we visit them. Which was also untrue because I always bought my own extras or groceries if I needed entirely different meals. He said things along the lines of ‚ÄòThis isn‚Äôt how we raised you‚Äô and other personal attacks aimed at John as well. Jane, of course, started to cry, again for several days, and John was SHOOK. He has struggled since then to stand up to them at all, although I will say he at least now will gently hint to them, which is huge progress. Anyways, because of that incident, they spent the last few nights at a friend‚Äôs place, but one day we came home from work, the night before John was supposed to leave, and they had just‚Ä¶dropped their dog off at our house. No warning, no asking. Their reasoning was that their friends didn‚Äôt have a fenced yard, and Jane was too afraid to walk the dog until she‚Äôd take a shit. The irony about this is that their friends live in the equivalent of a gated community with extremely minimal crime. The plan was for John and I to have one last breakfast together before I dropped him off, but I got to spend the morning cleaning their dog‚Äôs piss and shit off our basement floor, and cleaning up several household items the dog ate. (She was a puppy at the time, so no hard feelings to the dog. We would have had the house ready HAD WE KNOWN a puppy was going to be staying with us. Grrr.)

They no longer stay at our place, which is just fine with me, but still visit way too often (in my opinion). The last time John was deployed and coming back, his mom came for a solo trip to visit that just happened, of course, to coincide with his trip home. And we were going to be leaving on our honeymoon about 2 days after he got back. To have some time to ourselves and avoid a scene, we may have given her slightly false info and told her John would be back on the 21, when he wasn‚Äôt back until the 24^(th). Well, when she found out which day he was actually coming back, she delayed her return home by 3 days DESPITE him telling her gently via text he wants to spend that time with me. (She ignores hints or intentionally misinterprets them.)

I‚Äôm already at the end of my rope, but this last year, she‚Äôs also started digitally pretending I don‚Äôt exist. For e.g., she made a Family Day post, and I was the only in law not included in the post. I don‚Äôt care in the sense that I‚Äôm not super active on social media, so it‚Äôs not about being posted, it‚Äôs about being the only one left out. She‚Äôs come to visit me for coffee three times when she‚Äôs been in the area and John was deployed, and each time sent a picture of our cat (a handsome boi, to be sure) to the group chat or to John and said something to the effect of ‚ÄúIt was so good to see the kitty boy again!‚Äù He, of course, deserves the spotlight, however. She didn‚Äôt mention even seeing me.

For me, the final straws have been the following 2 issues:

Incident 1: Last New Year‚Äôs Eve, the Darlings and I, sans John, were all at his one sister‚Äôs house (I was waiting to pick John up from a party). I had my dog with me, and she does NOT like being petted on the head, or SIL‚Äôs kids, who are nice but have zero manners. So she was pretty socially tapped out, and John‚Äôs brother went to pet her on the head goodbye. She snapped at the air next to him, so I had her lay down on the floor in front of my chair and said to him ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt touch her right now, she‚Äôs pretty tapped out.‚Äù Steve, in front of EVERYONE, said ‚ÄúAwww, no, she‚Äôs fiiiiine,‚Äù leaned over, and started rubbing and shaking her head in his hands. I stood up and moved her to the other side of the chair, but I honestly couldn‚Äôt believe he‚Äôd do that. John talked to him about it and let him know it really bothered me, mostly for my dog‚Äôs sake, but also because of the lack of respect in front of the whole family. I have yet to receive any form of apology or acknowledgement of the situation.

Incident 2: This last spring, John and I FINALLY were able to go on our Honeymoon. While we were there, Jane created a group chat for photos, updates, etc. Except‚Ä¶the members were her, Steve, and John, and it was called ‚ÄúJohn‚Äôs Adventures‚Äù. As if I don‚Äôt even exist. We were honeymooning in my home country so he could meet my extended family. When John showed me (he was wondering why I hadn‚Äôt seen a post she‚Äôd sent), it hurt so much, I broke down in tears and cried in the shower. (I am NOT a cryer.) John was clearly also hurt by it. He asked his one sister about it, and her response to him was that it‚Äôs normal for families and in laws not to do everything together, but it still hasn‚Äôt been sitting right with either of us.

Recently, his parents have been visiting again, looking at houses to move back. (Yes, I had a small meltdown when I heard that news.) While they were here, I chose not to go to any hangouts except two, because his sisters would be there too, so it would be more bearable, less tension. Jane noticed my absence and asked John ‚ÄúIs something wrong with OP? We‚Äôve barely seen her all week‚Äù. He told her that my feelings were hurt by the group chat. Her response to him was ‚ÄòOh, I forgot to add her to it‚Äô. Which would make sense, if she hadn‚Äôt named it JOHN‚ÄôS Adventures. She never mentioned it to me, apologized, or even acknowledged she did anything wrong. They also walked into our house unannounced multiple times, despite John texting something like ‚ÄòBy the way, send a text or call before you come over because I might be naked lol‚Äô.

I am at the point where I want to go no contact with them. I‚Äôm already feeling disrespected while they‚Äôre living far away, and I can‚Äôt imagine how much worse it‚Äôll be when they live here. Both his sisters mentioned when they DID live here, they expected the kids to something with them every weekend, and something tells me they‚Äôll have similar expectations now, especially because they‚Äôre both going to be retired. John doesn‚Äôt think he should say anything unless another incident pops up, and he‚Äôll address things as they happen. However, I think he needs to tell his parents, particularly Jane, right now, something like ‚ÄòThis is my wife, I love her, and you need to stop treating her with disrespect‚Äô. John thinks he‚Äôs doing enough, and he‚Äôs upset that I‚Äôm asking him to do more. I have had enough. Am I being unreasonable? I‚Äôve told John if he won‚Äôt have my back in a firm way, even if it pisses them off, that I‚Äôll be going no contact. He doesn‚Äôt want that either and thinks I should be the one to talk to her. But my thinking is, they both know they‚Äôve hurt me and still haven‚Äôt apologized or acknowledged it, so I don‚Äôt see the point. I want to have a good relationship with them, but I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible. They‚Äôre not evil or monsters or anything, but they‚Äôre just not people I want to have in my life. There have been other incidents as well, I‚Äôve just included the bigger ones for the sake of keeping this short. Potato People, HELP!

For the past five weeks I've been feeling off, not sick, just off. A few months back I was studying for my degree, pursuing career goals, running tons (which meant I get to enjoy tons of food) and enjoying my daily life. But now it feels like a constant fight with myself. Going for a run is a chore, going to work is a chore, getting up is a chore, reading is a chore, making food is a chore, etc etc. 

I have some ideas of what might be causing it: maybe it's spending more time on Instagram (my friend is currently in another country so can't use his number, and we're all living together next year so I've started doomscrolling more). Or maybe its because I don't have that same structure as I did before from university.

Another option is maybe my dating life. Around 5 weeks ago I decided to say fuck it and hop into the dating scene - which has gone great! I've been seeing this girl for around 3-4 weeks and really enjoy spending time with her. 

However, my emotions feel... weird. I'm not really sad anymore? But, not in a bad OR good way. I still laugh at memes and enjoy getting coffee and etc. I feel like I'm just not worried about anything, in a bad way. Like it feels like I just don't know what being sad feels like anymore, like in a sociopathic way. Its just kinda worrying.

Also my fianc√©e goes by they/them so naturally, theres a lot of ""they's"" and ""them's"" in this story instead of ""she's"" and ""hers""

Also sorry for this being very wordy, theres a lot of moving parts.



We've been together since covid started, so we've been through a good couple of ups and downs in the relationship. From having a friend group crash and burn in front of our very eyes very early on in our relationship, to getting engaged last year, we've been through some stuff and I'm happy to say that they are the love of my life. We moved in together just over 3 years ago in an apartment that literally fell in our lap. Cheap rent, from a landlord that is a very close family friend of mine, as well as my fianc√©e's parents moving 3 hours away right around the time we were considering the apartment, and i had just gotten a raise/promotion so it LITERALLY fell in our lap and was the perfect opportunity. We were super excited to have our future with one another.

However, over the past couple months, they have been bringing up issues they've had with me for the past few years that had caught me by surprise because I didnt think they would let things build up like they have. Granted, most of these issues that they have with me, I absolutely agree with them and have profusely held myself accountable for. But the accountibility didnt seem to be reciprocated nearly as much and I feel this is slowly forming into a ""this is all my fault"" sort of deal when there are things that I wish my fianc√©e did to not let things snowball so that they didnt alter their perception of me.

For example, early on i was really clingy in the relationship. This was the first time I was in a relationship for a while AND covid was happening so a lot of time was spent talking on the phone (like 16 hour phone calls sometimes). I had thought that the desire for them to talk with me so much was genuine because it hadnt been brought up as an issue until over 5 years later. Obviously there was some desire to talk with me for periods of time, but this was an issue for them that they had brought up to me recently and it makes sense that they would feel like i was being clingy. Back then, they wouldve wanted to spend more time by themself but felt like they couldn't because I wanted to talk on the phone so often. So, I get where they're coming from. Its something that hasnt been an issue for a while since we've lived together (obviously) but i understand that and take accountability for it.

Another example is that a lot of times, i get defensive over some simple questions they ask me that are not meant with any ill intent. I struggle with trust issues that I've had from my mother growing up that made me feel like i have to be defensive about things. I understand that those familial issues are not my fault, but they become my fault when i dont adress them over time, AND when it starts affecting other people. So i understand that issue. (Planning on getting a therapist soon when my open enrollment for health insurance kicks in for my job) 

Another issue they had with me before is a bit more of a gray area? Obviously there are things that i totally understand where they come from, but other things ive felt like i havent been appreciated for NEARLY as much as i should be.

Essentially, I make most of the money in the house and i pay for almost everything that's shared between us. Gas/electric, internet, most of the big grocery trips ( but they very often go for smallish trips for groceries as well), a majority of the rent, emergency expenses, phone bill (and I payed for their phone), and a couple more things. I also drive us everywhere whenever we go out to a function, so a lot of gas too, and going out to eat/ordering takeout etc.

They have had a job and a car ever since before moving in together, so we've mostly kept payments split based on how much income we make. In short, I pay for more things cause I make more money. I have no complaints about having to do that whatsoever.

They ALSO have chronic stomach issues so its hard for them a lot of the time to do things around the house or to even go out sometimes, even calling out of work sometimes because they have had such bad flare ups. I'll take them to appointments, the ER, and ill pick up their meds and whatnot because they can't themself sometimes. Its not debilitating stomach issues 100% of the time, but enough that they often get in the way of things.

Also, for additional context, I have recently gotten a new job after quitting the worst job of my entire life. In short, this job was utter hell. It turned me into someone that i did not like and that affected things at home for a little while. But i stuck the job out for as long as i could because i didnt have another job lined up AND i knew all the aformentioned responsibilities i had that i needed this job for. 

Now, the issue that they have brought up to me lately that I totally understand is that I didnt do a good job of noticing when they did things around the house. There would be times where i brought up feeling like I do a lot of the work around the house because on my days off of working this hellish job, i would clean the house and I would do a lot in 1 go. It was wrong of me to have this idea they dont do enough around the house because there were things i just didnt notice that they did, as well as things they couldn't do because of their stomach issues. That is something I hold myself accountable for, it was wrong of me to assume they hadnt done things because i didnt see them. The job I had really put me on edge every single day (I worked at staples in the print section as the supervisor in an insanely high volume store with customers threatening me on a very uncomfortable basis, in case anyone was wondering. But that is a whole other can of worms to open.) And it affected how i saw things at home. But again, i need to hold myself accountable for things.


The GRAY area for me was that i didnt know when i should've been stern about them doing some things around the house vs when i should have taken care of things myself. Again, they have chronic issues. HOWEVER, there would be plenty of times where they would go out into the kitchen just to grab a snack or make food when i felt as though they couldve thrown gross old food away on their way in there. It had gotten to a point where they would leave unfinished food and drinks out to rot and grow mold sitting on our coffee table, and we had also gotten gnats that we could not figure out the source of. And it even kept happening after i mentioned it to them as an issue i had. It took me to be the one to show initiative to fix the stuff that sat for sometimes weeks at a time, on top of a couple other things that piled up. 

I had told them that i understood not being able to function well because of their chronic stomach issues and Im here to support you. But at the VERY LEAST, can you please throw away your food so that it doesn't grow moldy and stink up the apartment and become a biohazard. Eventually things got better in that regard after discussing them and we carried on.

All that to pretty much say I do a lot for my fianc√©e. I know ive made some mistakes when it came to my job and how i handled myself because of it, but I work hard and im trying to be a good man. I do because i know their struggles and i have been supporting them when their rich family cant even spare some fucking money to pay for their schooling, so my fiancee had to take out a school loan to support taking more classes to graduate quicker because that's what they want to do. So, I started paying for things more often because I know they don't want to work and go to school at the same time (i didn't even do that when i went to school because i know it would've been hell for me too). Mind you, I'm making less than I was working for that shitty job, but I'm still making things work.


Lately, as ive mentioned, the issues that have been brought up seemed to have snowballed into the past few months feeling like pure emotional torture because now i doubt myself about a lot of things. I think this level of self reflection is good for me because there have been a lot of unchecked things that i didnt even know existed without my fianc√©e bringing them up to me. But the only problem i had with that is that i had to find out about a lot of those issues myself. 

I've been noticing the signs of them not feeling intimate or romantic or even cuddly a lot of the time. I tend to be someone who speaks directly when i feel someone bothers me. So, I usually expect people to tell me when something is bothering them OR i tend to pick up on when someone has an issue with me. I had noticed these changes in their behavior for a few MONTHS leading up to this, so i naturally brought things up to them. I started getting really insecure about things even to the point of thinking they mightve been cheating on me (not saying i should have thought that, i tend to overthink a lot. But i just didnt know what to think EVEN after talking to them about it). They told me that they had been in denial about the feelings of me changing, attributing the change of feelings to the new birth control that they started taking that was making them feel less romantic/less in the mood for ""certain activities"". But eventually they told me that the feelings they had been having were real and not from the change in medicine, they just didnt want to believe them.

Also, this all came out to me with the help of their therapist, so obviously there's some professional help involved so im taking the issues they're having with me seriously. 

But the main issue I had with these things are that things have balled up for the past few years and they're now coming to me about everything. Meanwhile, I was under the impression that they would tell me whenever something bothers them because of conversations we had about that topic. And usually, they did bring up the smaller things that bothered them so I had no reason to not trust that theyd bring up bigger issues that persisted.

The problem I had for a while was that when I bring things up that they have done to bother me, they have a hard time seeing where im coming from a lot of the time and it has tended to feel like they cant keep themselves accountable for things. They have a very very hard time saying the words ""I'm sorry"". Things have gotten better in that regard, but im just typing this for context about the issues we had.

There have been times where I've tried to comfort them about when they cant figure out something in a videogame but they made me feel as though I was annoying them, a lot of times a lack of appreciation for doing things, feeling awkward and left out/ignored/unheard during friend gatherings. All these things i feel have gotten better over time, but i feel like ive struggled trying to get them to acknowledge these things up until more recently when they brought up all these issues with me.

Mind you, again, most of this stuff was brought up apart of this big argument recently so its our biggest argument that we've had in our entire relationship.

Basically, all this to say that we both have issues when it comes to one another. But I feel that theyre not willing to put in the work to get back to where we were and now they want to move in with their mother partly because things have gone a bit sour here. They've wanted to live with their mother for a long time now and im willing to eventually sacrifice being close to my family down here to move with their family over there (since i have my own issues with my family, and theyve been living down here with my family for a while so its only fair to consider moving up there with their family).

But now my fianc√©e says that they have lost the spark/romance in our relationship and they dont think they love me anymore, but the reasoning just doesn't make sense to me. They said something along the lines of ""I don't know if continuing to try is going to bring that spark back"" but thats kinda what we signed up for when we decided we wanted to get married. Again, this is our first ever big argument we've had in our entire relationship so there's obviously going to be some doubts about things. But I went into the proposal/engagement FULLY KNOWING that we would be in situations like this, but I feel like im the only one who's willing to really work to get back to where we were. 

Mind you, they started having doubts about me like 5 or 6 months after we got engaged which really has me so confused and feeling like the desire to end things is a bit impulsive. I also sincerely do not think that they have been unfaithful to me in any way.

We were both outwardly very on board with this engagement/marriage, so much so that they (jokingly kinda) were upset that i didnt propose sooner. They also say that there isnt really a reason why they lost feelings, they just did over time. I also asked if they may be having commitment issues and they dont think thats the case either. They told me that they were willing to look past the issues we had with one another to continue this marriage, but the feelings they have for me have just simply changed and i just dont get it.

I understand shit happens and feelings change, but i can't help but feel like im just not appreciated? Maybe? Also, them not saying the words ""thank you"" to me has always been a point of contention between us when it comes to gift giving or doing things around the house (albiet this is also something that has improved a lot over time). Do we just need time to heal?? I want them to be happy and if thats not with me, then so be it. But I dont wana regret not giving us proper time to heal from this if thats just simply what we need. I feel we owe it to each other to give this time to heal because we've been through so much over the years AND WE PRACTICALLY JUST GOT ENGAGED. And im afraid that they may have a change of heart if they decide to move away. Ive been going through so much emotional turmoil idek at this point.

We're 2 different people who were brought up 2 different ways, and those ways clash sometimes but I love them because of the good they have in their heart and the things they do for me. It has just been feeling like they really dont appreciate all the work ive put in to make things work for us and now they've lost feelings for me because of a seemingly unidentifiable reason.


Sorry for the tldr being a whole paragraph, but there are a lot of moving parts to this situation that it was hard just making it a couple sencences.

If youve gotten this far, thank you for reading this. I have been emotionally drained for weeks/months and I just needed my thoughts to go out into the dark aether. I really appreciate you for reading this.

Advice or insight?


TL;DR 
Fianc√©e is slowly losing feelings for me. They let some issues snowball over the years because of their hesitancy to tell me about these issues in the past, and most of them have been aired out over the past few months with the help of their therapist. They want me to be held accountible for them. I understand exactly where they're coming from and Ive held myself accountible for them. Ive ALSO had issues with them that they eventually held themself accountible for, but now they feel they lost the spark/romance in the relationship. Mind you, this is the first big argument we've ever had so i want to put in the work to bring things back to where they were, but i dont think they feel the same way.",0,1754189719.0,relationship_advice,5,0.5,False

I asked her if she got tickets to throw up Bob Dylan too. I know it didn't make much sense but I was mad.

1mg8eed,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mg8eed,"She Googled how to photograph a baby mid-session ‚Äì then snatched the photos from my hands and refused service (Fast East Goods & Printing, Winnipeg)","I had seen some warnings online about Fast East Goods & Printing Services (2116 Pembina Hwy, Winnipeg), but didn‚Äôt fully believe them‚Äîuntil I brought my two-month-old baby in for a passport photo. It turned into one of the worst service experiences I‚Äôve ever had. Here‚Äôs what happened:

‚∏ª

‚ö†Ô∏è Price changed without notice

She first quoted $25.99. After reconfirming, she added an extra $9.99‚Äîwithout explanation. I still booked the earliest slot at 11:00 AM, but she showed up over 10 minutes late. While I waited with my baby, she took walk-in customers ahead of me.

‚∏ª

üì∑ Totally unprofessional photo process

She grabbed a white hoodie from her couch, flipped it inside out, and used it as a background on her coffee table. My baby was placed directly on that.

The camera‚Äôs autofocus was so slow (5‚Äì10 seconds per shot) that she missed almost every good moment. After 20+ blurry shots, she actually asked ChatGPT: ‚ÄúHow to take photos of a baby?‚Äù

Then she Googled Canada‚Äôs passport photo rules‚Äîand realized too late that the baby‚Äôs ears had to be visible. So we had to start over.

‚∏ª

üñ•Ô∏è Poor editing and baby exposed to heat

She used Photoshop to erase hoodie wrinkles but the result looked messy and unprofessional.

Meanwhile, my baby started fussing from the heat, so my wife took him outside to cool off. In hindsight, this whole ordeal was not worth it.

‚∏ª

üí∏ Undisclosed extra charges

She said the total was $43.68. The receipt showed:
	‚Ä¢	$22.99 for ‚Äúpassport photo‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	$5 ‚Äútoddler charge‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	$9.99 for ‚ÄúChina travel document photo‚Äù

None of these fees were mentioned beforehand. When I asked why it was different from the original quote, she just said ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù When I asked for the $2 difference to be refunded, she said ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt. That‚Äôs how the system is.‚Äù No explanation. No apology.

‚∏ª

üö® Then things got ugly

As I turned to leave (not wanting to argue with a baby waiting in a hot car), she suddenly grabbed the printed photos and receipt out of my hands and said she was refunding me because she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt like working with petty customers.‚Äù

She added: ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt get the photos anymore.‚Äù

I still haven‚Äôt seen any refund as of writing this.

‚∏ª

ü§Ø She then lectured me

She claimed I was ‚Äúungrateful,‚Äù that I got a ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù (despite being overcharged), and that I didn‚Äôt tip. She even blamed my baby, saying he cried the whole time‚Äîwhich was just false. He had been calm and even smiling during most of the shoot.

I pointed out that the delays were due to her lack of skill. She got furious again and told us to go elsewhere.

Despite all this, my wife and I remained calm. We even said we‚Äôd pay again‚Äîjust to get the photos and avoid redoing everything. She refused.

In the end, I asked her to destroy the photos and left.

We went to another professional studio right after, and the difference was night and day.

‚∏ª

‚ùóFinal thoughts

This was frustrating beyond belief. Unprofessional setup, hidden charges, and openly hostile behavior‚Äîespecially unacceptable when working with babies.

If you‚Äôre in Winnipeg and need baby passport photos, I strongly recommend avoiding this place.
