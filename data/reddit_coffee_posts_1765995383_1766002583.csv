1pp6p4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1pp6p4l/grind_control_why_does_this_get_so_much_flak/,Grind Control - Why does this get so much flak?,"I'm a big Breville fan. I had been eyeing a Grind Control for awhile but had been holding off because of how expensive it was combined with mediocre reviews. I like good coffee but I also like the idea of a fresh grinding machine I can setup to wake up to. I had a Cuisinart that I didn't love and dreamed of replacing with the Breville. So I decided to take a chance on an Ebay listing that claimed it was only used once and put back in the box.

My take after a week of use (yes I realize long term I may change my mind) I think most complaints are abuse of the machine.

One calibration is a must.

Two filtered water and descale (even though my used unit was claimed to be used once I descaled before my first use).

Three clean clean clean after each use. When my coffee is ready I have been immediately throwing out the grinds and rinsing out the basket and filter in the sink, dry right away and then quick wipe out any grinds inside the machine. Takes me less then 60 seconds and machine is ready to go again.

I'm sure I can make better coffee with my french press. But I think what it brews is pretty respectable and I love waking up to hearing the grinder and having fresh coffee ready to go in the carafe as soon as I make my way to the kitchen.

But I can see if you are not willing to take care of the unit its destined to go wrong.",1,1766002228.0,BrevilleCoffee,1,1.0,False

1pp6nml,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1pp6nml/flareups/,Flare-Ups,"I (22F) was recently diagnosed with IBS. Well, the doctors call it “unspecified diarrhea disease” but looking at everything, I understand that it’s IBS - the bloating, the flare-ups, the burning feeling, etc. And given that my meds are specifically for IBS and they work and also being in the risky group after gallbladder removal, well I put two and two together.

Anyways, I am currently sitting on the toilet and wanted to ask about managing my flare-ups. 

I don’t have them constantly, only if I am overstressed or if I eat something I shouldn’t - which really varies, one day I can eat chocolate and be alright and the next I will eat a piece from the same one and I will be living on the toilet for the next three days. 

Since I am a university student and I also have a very demanding job without proper toilet (currently a coffee stand job) I need a ways for me to deal with my flare-ups. And since it’s that time of the year (exams, exams, exams!) I am overstressed every day which also doesn’t help that much. 

So, what helps you? I tried diet for the period of the flare ups, but it made things only slightly better. Yes I am still taking my medicine (Duspatalin retard for cramps and some calcium mixed with codeine tablets). I need more ways, I can’t really shit myself in school during an interview or exam. 

Any kind of help will be really appreciated!",1,1766002127.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

Today NK has absolutely refused her first nap. Which included alligator rolling in my lap, trying to yeet herself off the chair, and head butting me. We tried for about an hour (with breaks) before giving up cause we were both overstimulated. 

Now we’re on a walk so she can get some fresh air and I can get some coffee and take a deep breath. 

I’m hoping that in an hour or two she just gets so tired that she won’t fight it as hard and actually get some rest. ",1,1766002104.0,NannyBreakRoom,0,1.0,False
1pp6mus,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pp6mus,KOReader plugin that periodically reminds you of your favorite quotes,"I recently made a KOReader plugin that goes through all the highlighted texts from your library, and pops-up a random one as a little widget every time you unlock, or resume focus. I recently moved to KOReader as my primary reading medium, and I have really fallen in love with it. I have a habit of highlighting a lot while reading, but I noticed I hardly ever actively come back to see the quotes I had saved for later. 

You can now install initial release of Random Quote plugin in your KOReader!  
[https://github.com/DenisovichDev/randomquote.koplugin](https://github.com/DenisovichDev/randomquote.koplugin)  
All the installation instructions are written there, and no, you don't have to be some sort of a programmer to be able to install it. I have added new features to this for everyone's ease of use:  
\- You can customize the widget by changing the font family, size and the title quote  
\- It works in both light and dark mode  
\- You can specify your folder where you keep your books for it to scan through

Let me know if you need any new feature for the next release, and if you find a bug or problem with a plugin, either DM me here or file an issue in GitHub. I would appreciate if you could star the repo!

Everything is free, no payment is necessary for installing this. If you wish to support these projects you can [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/denisovich)!

Anyway, let me know what you think, cheers.",6,1766002076.0,koreader,0,1.0,False

I

The evergreen crown of the trees weeps its leaves / It’s always the same oak-scented breeze / One leaf flew over my head like a joke I didn’t get / Like an easy riddle that I refuse to guess / That leaf was about to land on my shoulder / Unbeknownst to me, a delicate hand reached over / She snatched it and kept it in her pocket / I walked this river as if nothing had happened / How I regret not looking back; it’s that scene / She came out of nowhere; I was not aware

Your bittersweet, musky voice ripens my cheeks / You hum your sultry songs; I can’t speak / There was a word, and it was on the tip of my tongue / Your choice of glances and phrases, a lack thereof / I gun myself never to make you my muse / Yet I cannot be the only one squinting as you / Fly up; I’m barely learning how to / Swift off your flaming bronze feet; can you wait for me / I’m only here to embrace the storm you made / Seasons may change, but my reasons stay the same

Some air must have blown the dirt out of my eyes / I see you clearly; I want you to be mine / Some rising tides, flooding my doors / It's clear that there are signs, only that I am yours

II

I love the kind way you believe in me

I love the way you always defend me

I love the way you want to include me

I love the way you stand very still

I love how you’re constantly moving

I love the way you stare at the black and white, vague, nothing

I love the way you say my middle name

I love how cute you look when you’re mad

I love how you bring out the best in me

I love the way you are patient with me

You roll your eyes and give my arm a jab

I love the way you prepare my coffee, no sugar packs

—

I love how you constantly reassure me

I love the way you give me a sick heart

I love the way you laugh when I tease you

I love the sweet way you follow me down

I love the way you are so proud of me

I love the way you make me sing when I don’t know how

—

I love how you hide your laugh with your hands

I love the way you smile widely with your teeth

I smile widely as you teach Spanish A, B, and C’s

I love the way you paint a white canvas

And when acrylic paint stains your pants, your knees

—

I love the way you make life exciting

Yes, and you know where I am coming from

Because you felt the same way growing up

I love the way you make your jewelry

I love how you make my skinny heart fat

I love how you touch the yellow smoke on the front porch deck

And when you snap your fingers to the beat, so I can dance

—

I love the way you look, yet not at first

Love the way you dance and forget the hurt

I love how you take the lint off my suit

I love how we work together: brown walls

I love the way you show up at the hall

I love how a proud woman like you

1pp6kty,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pp6kty/the_unsung_verse/,The Unsung Verse,"The wind that day didn't blow; it shoved. It was a grey, blustery Tuesday, the kind where the sky looks like wet concrete and the air smells of ozone. Mark was walking home, head down, fighting the gale, when the object hit him.



It didn't flutter. It slapped against his chest with the weight of a wet towel, clinging to his coat.



Mark peeled it off. It was a piece of parchment, thick and textured, the color of old bone. On it, written in ink that looked disturbingly fresh, was a musical score.



It was a simple melody—a series of rising and falling notes that looked melancholic even on paper. In the corner, scribbled in jagged red script, was a warning:



DO NOT SING THIS TO AN AUDIENCE.



Mark was a musician by hobby, a man who hummed while he made coffee and whistled while he walked. He stared at the notes. His brain automatically translated the symbols into sound. It was a lullaby. A slow, haunting tune that felt familiar, like a memory from a childhood he never had.



He looked around. The street was empty. The wind howled.



He folded the paper and put it in his pocket.



That night, Mark sat in his kitchen, the paper smoothed out on the table.



He hummed the first bar. The sound resonated in the quiet room, deeper and richer than his voice usually allowed. It felt good. It felt like scratching an itch deep inside his throat.



He sang the lyrics. They were phonetic, a language of soft vowels and sharp consonants that rolled off his tongue like oil.



“Ohm-la… ka-re… vis-ta… mor.”



Nothing happened. The lights didn't flicker. The floor didn't shake. The only change was the temperature; the kitchen felt suddenly cooler, as if someone had left the refrigerator door open.



Mark laughed, shaking his head. ""Just a song,"" he muttered. ""A creepy song, but just a song.""



He practiced it for an hour. He mastered the cadence. He perfected the pitch. It was beautiful. It was too good to keep to himself. He needed to hear how it sounded in the air, bounced off another person.



He picked up his phone. ""Hey, Johnny. Are you home? I want to show you something.""



Johnny met him at the park bench near the lake. It was dusk, the sun bleeding orange into the water.



""So, you found a magic song?"" Johnny asked, grinning, taking a sip of his coffee. ""Let’s hear it, maestro.""



Mark cleared his throat. He held the parchment, though he had already memorized the notes. He closed his eyes, letting the melody take over.



He sang.



The song poured out of him, carrying a weight that silenced the crickets and the rustling leaves. It was a song of ending. A song of things that wait in the dark.



As Mark hit the final, low note, he felt a vibration in his chest, a profound sense of completion.



He opened his eyes, expecting Johnny to be impressed.



Johnny wasn't smiling.



Johnny was pale, his coffee cup frozen halfway to his mouth. His eyes were wide, fixed on a point directly over Mark’s left shoulder.



""Mark,"" Johnny whispered, his voice trembling. ""Don't move.""



Mark frowned. ""What? Did I mess up the pitch?""



""Mark,"" Johnny said, and a tear tracked down his cheek. ""What is that tall man doing behind you?""



Mark felt the blood drain from his face. The air behind him was freezing. ""There’s nobody behind me, Johnny.""



""Yes, there is!"" Johnny’s voice rose to a panic. ""He’s standing right there! He’s… oh god, he’s looking at me. Why is he looking at me?""



Mark started to turn. ""Johnny, stop it, you’re scaring—""



""HE'S REACHING FOR ME!"" Johnny screamed.



There was a sound. It wasn't a loud sound. It was a dry, sharp crack, like a dead branch snapping under a heavy boot.



Johnny’s head twisted.



It moved with unnatural speed, snapping violently to the side. It didn't stop at the shoulder. It kept going, turning almost a full hundred and eighty degrees until Johnny was looking backward.



Johnny slumped forward off the bench, hitting the grass with a heavy thud.



Mark stood frozen, his breath caught in a silent scream. He looked at his friend. He looked at the space behind the bench.



There was nothing there. Just the wind.



Mark didn't check for a pulse. He saw the angle. He knew.



Panic, primal and white-hot, seized him. He turned and ran. He sprinted out of the park, his lungs burning, the parchment crinkling in his fist.



He reached the alleyway behind a convenience store three blocks away and collapsed against the brick wall, gasping.



""It was the song,"" he choked out. ""The song called it.""



He looked at the parchment in his hand. The red warning seemed to glow in the dim streetlight. DO NOT SING THIS TO AN AUDIENCE.



""I need to get rid of it,"" Mark said in a low voice.



He grabbed the paper with both hands and tried his best to tear it apart.



The paper stretched. It gave like rubber, elastic and tough, but it wouldn't rip. Mark pulled harder, straining until his muscles shook. The paper snapped back to its original shape, unblemished.



He pulled out his lighter. He flicked the flame and held it to the corner of the page.



The fire licked the paper. It should have curled. It should have turned to ash. Instead, the flame danced harmlessly against the surface. The paper remained cool to the touch.



Mark dropped the lighter. He grabbed a marker from his pocket—a permanent marker he used for work—and frantically tried to scribble over the notes. If I can’t read it, nobody can.



The black ink touched the page and vanished. It evaporated like water on a hot sidewalk. The notes remained, crisp and clear.



Mark stared at the cursed object. He realized then that he wasn't the owner of the song. He was just the instrument. He was the radio, and he had broadcast the signal.



Sanctuary, he thought. I need holy ground.



He ran again.



The city blurred around him. He saw the church in the distance, a cross silhouetted against the moon.



If I get inside, Mark thought, it can’t touch me.



He sprinted across the street, ignoring the blare of horns. He reached the sidewalk. The heavy oak doors of the church were just fifty feet away.



He hit the bottom step.



The wind returned.



It wasn't a breeze this time. It was a roar. It slammed into Mark like a physical blow, knocking the breath out of him.



His fingers, slick with sweat, lost their grip.



The parchment was ripped from his hand.



""No!"" Mark screamed, lunging for it.



He watched in horror as the paper caught an updraft. It danced in the air, swirling higher and higher, moving with a playful, malicious intent. It drifted over the church fence, back toward the busy street.



Mark stood on the steps, reaching out to the empty air.



A sound reached his ears. It was a whisper, carried on the wind. It sounded exactly like his own voice.



“The song is over.”



Mark felt a cold hand, large and impossibly strong, grip his chin. Another hand gripped the top of his head.



He didn't have time to scream.



Crack.



Mark’s vision spun violently sideways. The world tilted. The church steps rushed up to meet his face.



As darkness closed in, the last thing Mark heard was the rustle of paper in the wind. It sounded like a chuckle, drifting down the street, waiting for the next curious stranger to PICK!

1pp6ke2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pp6ke2/i_met_a_boy_who_hid_forever/,I Met a Boy Who Hid Forever,"I was 22 and had graduated with a bachelor’s degree in English six months ago. I always imagined that as soon as I graduated I’d be publishing books or running some avant-garde lit mag, but I was having a hard time finding my first “real” job. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was running out of time to do something great. 

I’d been working as a volunteer slush reader for *Dark Dreams Review,* but I quit after a month when it became clear that the journal wasn’t going anywhere: nothing they published was new or special.

With no job or responsibilities, I started going for long walks around my neighborhood, daydreaming about all the ways I could reinvent myself: move to Hollywood and live out of my car while working on my screenplays, sell all my possessions and travel the country in a van.

It was during one of these walks that I saw the man. We were on Bernard Street and walking toward each other. The middle of winter, and yet, he wore a t-shirt and shorts. When he walked past me I felt a surge of heat and fetid air, like an oven full of plastic had just opened. I turned around in time to see him crossing the street.

An SUV ran a stop sign as the man walked out in front of it. I screamed and threw my hands in the air, but the car passed right through him.

The car moved steadily ahead, and the man continued walking. It was only then, staring at him with my mouth agape, that I realized: the man was somewhat opaque, not obviously so, but enough that I could look through him and vaguely make out dark shadows.

I watched the ghost until he turned the corner, then I followed. I rounded the bend in time to see him walking toward an abandoned house on the right. He entered the front yard and disappeared.

I was stuck in place and breathing hard when a voice came from behind me.

“You can see him too, can’t you?”

I turned around to see a tall, handsome man about my age, with curly blond hair and brown eyes. He looked down at me and smiled like I’d done something surprisingly cute. A kid who solved a math problem she hadn’t been taught in school.

“Yes,” I said. “Who is he?”

“Your guess is as good as mine. You followed him, right?”

I nodded.

“He’s always walking the same path, but he disappears right here. I think it’s where he used to live.”

“What makes you think that?”

“Where else would you spend your afterlife trying to reach?” He shrugged. “My name’s Charles. You want to get a cup of coffee?”

I laughed, and he flinched as if I’d hit him. “I’ll take that as a no?” he asked.

“Yes!” I said, too sharply. “I mean, no. You shouldn’t take it as a no. My name’s Sarah. Let’s get a cup of coffee and… you can tell me more about the ghost?”

“I don’t know anything else. But I can tell you more about me.”

I’m not sure if I said yes because I liked his smile, or because I didn’t want to give up the adventure. 

We spent the 10-minute walk to Collective Coffee making awkward small talk about our lives and hobbies. He was an accountant who spent his free time hiking and rock climbing. He was delighted to know that I was an English major, but when he asked me about a few old books he seemed somewhat disappointed that I didn’t recognize them.

Collective Coffee was a cute little spot I’d never been to before. The walls were covered with black and white portraits of couples and families, and next to the menu above the counter there was a blown-up image of a newspaper article touting the shop as winner of the city’s 1984 “best cup of coffee” competition. The place was empty aside from an old man and woman sitting in the far corner by the bathroom and a barista with pink hair who stood at the counter and greeted us as we approached.

I smiled at her and looked up to study the menu. I was thinking about either a latte or a cappuccino, but then Charles was already ordering his Americano. *Rude,* I thought.

“And she’ll have… a chai tea latte?” He finished.

“Uh, sure.”

The girl gave me a sympathetic look, then went to make our drinks.

A few minutes later we were sitting down at a round table in the front.

“So, how often do you see ghosts?” Charles asked.

“Not often,” I didn’t want him to know that this was the first time.

“I’ve been seeing them since I was little,” he said, looking down at his drink.

Charles' childhood home was just on the other end of Bernard Street. He often stopped by because, sometimes, he could see his mother’s ghost through the kitchen window. He’d seen the ghost I’d been watching a few times over the years but had just happened to be walking back from visiting his mom that day.

“So… what happened to your mom?”

“She died.”

“Oh… yeah. Um, do you see ghosts every day?”

“Only when I’ve been out mushroom hunting.”

“Mushroom hunting?”

“Yeah. I like to search around trails and forests for rare mushrooms. Sometimes I eat the edible ones.”

It took me a second to get it. He looked worried until I started laughing.

I made some excuse about my parents needing my help at home. Before I could leave he said, “let’s get dinner… Tuesday night?”

When I took a moment to reply he said, “We can talk about… whatever.”

“Sure,” I said. “I’ll text you.”

\*\*\*

Dinner went okay. He was sweet but awkward; he kept teetering on the edge of telling me something about ghosts. He’d say something like, “sometimes they look, well…” and then go silent before changing the subject. It was like he wasn’t sure if he could trust me. I was determined to show that he could.

We started hanging out a few times a week. Sometimes we’d get dinner, other times it was coffee, a movie, or a walk.

I can’t say I ever liked him that much, at least not romantically, but there was a certain dependency that started not long after the first dinner date. To some degree, I felt close to him because of the power we shared. But he also had this anxious desperation. He hid it well with his smiles and cheesy jokes, but I could tell by how *hard* he tried that he was holding his breath with me, or on the edge of his seat, silently begging me not to go. He paid for things and opened doors; he gave me flowers and chocolate. When it was time to say goodbye each night, he’d grab my hand and hold it for just a little too long. Before letting go, he’d squeeze hard, as if considering pulling me in.

So when one day Charles asked me if I wanted to go back to his apartment, I said yes. Not because I felt that I had to, and not because I thought he would be mad if I said no, but because I wanted to be there for him. I wanted to see where he lived, what he kept in his fridge, what he had on his walls, what his room smelled like, I wanted to understand him.

He had no welcome mat or decorations, just a TV, a couch, and some books stacked against the wall. No kitchen table, no recliner, no place to put our shoes.

“You sure know how to live,” I said.

He laughed. “When I was a kid, I spent all my time inside. I didn’t get the chance to experience much. So, when I started living on my own, I decided I’d spend as much time outside as possible. No need for a lot when I’m barely here.”

We sat down on the couch and talked for a while. I don’t remember what about. What I do remember is the way his eyes softened and his lips parted slowly. How he lowered his chin in a way that made him look like a child. I remember, better than I remember anything else, how softly he asked me:

“Will you please try to find me?”

“What?”

“I want you to go outside, count to 10, then come inside and find me.”

Something about the way he asked made it so I couldn’t say no. I went outside and closed the door behind me.

Standing outside in the dark, I was cold and shivering. My heart was pounding and I couldn’t catch my breath. I contemplated running to my car and just forgetting about Charles. I mean, I’d really only known him for a few weeks at this point. Why did he so desperately need me to play this game? I should have just left, but… I had to know where this was going.

When I finished counting I opened the door and scanned the living room. I took a step forward and the sound echoed off the bare walls. I imagined Charles hiding just around the corner. He suddenly had a knife and a rope. He knew exactly where I was. He was waiting.

My throat tightened. The door slammed shut behind me and I cried out. I wanted to leave, but no… it was just a game. I laughed at myself for being so ridiculous.

I took my shoes off before taking another step. The apartment was small and there weren’t a lot of places to hide, but I took my time. I checked behind the couch, under the bed, behind the shower curtain. Each time I turned a corner or opened a door my body was tensed to run.

When I opened the towel closet I found him curled into a ball under the shelf. He was rocking himself back and forth and crying. I reached for him, and he straightened his legs and scooted out. I helped him get to his feet, and he just stared at me. His eyes were wide and he was shaking.

For a moment neither of us moved, but when he took a shaky breath, I leaned in and kissed him. I didn’t know how else to make him feel better.

We had sex that night. I was on top of him with my hands on his chest. I looked straight ahead at the wall the whole time. When we were done we laid next to each other. When he fell asleep I got up and went home.

I came over again to watch a movie a few days later. We sat close together on the couch, almost touching but not.

We were about halfway through when he gently grabbed my chin, turned me toward him, and kissed me. I pulled away on instinct.

“Sorry,” I said. “I just… really like this movie.”

We watched for a little longer, then he paused the TV and said, “Can I tell you something?”

“Of course.”

He took a deep breath.

Charles saw a ghost for the first time while playing in the backyard with his mom. Only, he didn’t realize it was a ghost. He thought it was funny that the yellow dog kept walking back and forth from the big tree to their back door.

When he perfectly described the dog that had died before he was born, was buried under the tree, and that he had absolutely not seen any pictures of, his mom brought him inside and prayed over him for hours.

Later, when he began talking about a “grey man” in the house, she beat him so badly that he was kept out of school for a week for fear of teachers taking notice. She started drinking, and her beatings became more and more frequent. Only, she got smarter about how she dished them out; she hit him in places where no one could see the evidence. She said she was beating the demons out of him.

He started hiding every time his mom drank, or when he knew she’d be coming home late from the bar. She’d walk into the house screaming his name. Sometimes, if he hid really well, it would take her an hour to find him. But she would never stop looking until she did.

“Even now,” he said, “part of me feels… loved. She always looked for me so hard. Like I mattered to her more than anything else in the world. She wanted to find me and beat me because she thought she could cure me. If she hated me she could have just kicked me out or killed me, you know? She never stopped looking, and she never stopped trying. Until she died.”

It happened when he was 12. She came home after a long night at the bar and found him quickly because he wasn’t hiding at all. He was sitting on the couch waiting for her.

She went to slap him, but when her arm was just an inch from his face, he caught her by the wrist, squeezed hard, looked her in the eyes, and told her *no.*

When she tried to hit him with her other hand, he caught that one too. He let go, and she tried to hit him again and again. Each time he stopped her. He didn’t hit her back, but for the first time, he defended himself. She ran to her room sobbing.

“I should’ve just hid,” he said. “She would’ve looked for me, and she would’ve found me, like always.”

But in the morning it was he who found her, dead in her bed. There was another her checking in closets and behind furniture.

“I’m right here,” he told her.

She turned.

“You found me.”

She walked toward him like she always did, eyes narrowed and fist raised to strike. But when she brought that fist down, it went swiftly through him like a knife through a thin layer of smoke. She tried to hit him again and again as she screamed like a banshee. 

He backed away. “Why do you want to hurt me!?”

“There’s a demon inside you! You need to stop talking to ghosts!” 

“You’re a ghost!”

He ran out of the house and called the police. But as he looked through the front window, he saw her peeking behind the TV with her arm reared back.

When he was done talking, I told him to hide, and that night I looked for him harder than ever.

For weeks after, almost every night, I’d search for him and we'd end up in bed. I didn’t particularly like the strange game of hide-and-seek, but I didn’t hate it either. It made him happy. I really did want him to be happy. Even if I didn’t love him like he loved me.

\*\*\*

One day, we were hiking through a trail he’d been begging to take me to for weeks. It was special to him, and he kept stopping to tell me facts about different plants and wildlife. It was so mind-numbingly boring. I kept trying to steer the conversation toward ghosts. I asked him if he could see any right now, or if he could sense any nearby, but all he would say was something like “that’s not how it works” before saying something about the trail. He had just finished explaining the lineage of some tree when I came right out and said it.

“I’m starting to get bored. Will you take me to see your mom?” 

I think we both knew that I was being intentionally vague about what exactly I was getting bored of. I could see the fear in his eyes.

He swallowed hard before answering. “Okay. But only once.”

\*\*\*

We went on a Wednesday in the early afternoon so that the family who lived there would all be at school or work. It was a square house on the corner of Bernard Street. Brown brick, three steps up to the patio and front door. We walked through the grass to the right side of the house and looked in through the kitchen windows.

While the house was foundationally no different from the average suburban home, the owners had made it their own in a way that was beautiful. The counter in front of the window held a yellow coffee mug with crudely drawn black lines meant to resemble a bee. The fridge was covered with crayon drawings and A+ grades. There were five chairs circled around the kitchen table.

When I looked over at Charles, his face was pressed against the glass, his breath fogged the space in front of his lips.

“Is she here?” I asked. “I don’t see her.”

Charles only nodded.

“What… what is she doing?”

“Just… walking.”

I closed my eyes and tried to imagine it. A cursed, phantom lady roaming the home, fist-raised, a fiery anger in her eyes as she hunted for her kid in a house full of others. I wondered if any of them ever saw her. Or if she saw them.

After a few moments Charles said, “We better get going before someone sees us,” and we began walking aimlessly down the street.

“Why do you think she’s still there?” I asked. 

“Trauma, I guess. Or purpose. Maybe they’re the same thing. I mean, I was my mom’s trauma, and her purpose was to stop me, right?”

“How come I can’t see her? And how come I can see the one on the street? I don’t understand.”

“I don’t either. But you’re not like me. I see ghosts all the time. You only see the one, right?”

“Yeah. But what’s so special about that one?”

“I don’t know. Maybe you’re connected somehow.” He paused for a moment before finishing. “Please don’t make me take you back here again.”

That night I looked for Charles, and when I found him, he cried so hard that I couldn’t do anything but just hold his head in my lap and brush his hair. It was the first time I felt guilty about us. Did he realize how transactional our relationship was? I thought he did. 

“I’m sorry,” I said, hoping he knew what I meant.

\*\*\*

Around that time, I found a full-time job as an SAT/ACT tutor. Charles was the first person I called when I got the news. 

“I’m so excited for you,” he said. “You deserve it so much, and I know you’ll do great. How about dinner tonight to celebrate?”

He pulled out all the stops. We had steak and wine, then chocolate cake for dessert. He kept telling me that I was so smart and so qualified. He said it so many times that I was starting to feel like he doubted it. 

At the end of the night he walked me to my car. When we were saying goodbye he looked at me so pleadingly, the way he did when he wanted me to go back to his place and find him. But he could tell that I was tired and he was too sweet to ask. Instead, he gave me a tight hug and squeezed my hand. 

I found myself enjoying my job and looking forward to sessions with students. For the first time in a while I felt as though I had a purpose: helping kids get into college. 

I spent so much more than 40 hours a week on my work. I made detailed plans for each student. I imagined how excited they would be when they finally got their goal scores. It took up almost all my time. I loved it. 

I still cared for Charles, but I was getting bored, and the newfound purpose made it hard to ignore the guilt.

So I began drifting away from him. We went from going to his apartment every day to hanging out once a week. Whenever we were together I had this heavy feeling in my chest, like I was mourning something. Once a week turned to every other week, and I could tell that he realized what was happening. Sometimes there were tears in his eyes when we parted ways. 

Eventually we were just texting every few days, like old college friends. 

How’s work?

Good. 

You?

Good. 

This continued for a while, but as I settled into the routine of my job, I was bored again. The students seemed to get dumber and less motivated over time. It was frustrating to explain the same thing over and over, week after week in all kinds of different ways. They just wouldn’t learn, and yet their parents blamed me when their scores didn’t increase. After a while, I decided there wasn’t a point in what I was doing after all. There was no purpose. Just a job.

I started going to see the street ghost on my own. I started to think of him as *my* ghost. My personal reminder that there was more to the world than test scores and bratty teenagers. I became braver, more used to him. I’d walk directly behind him, copying his every move. As we neared the old house, I’d close my eyes and keep walking, imagining that I was him, finishing the steps that he couldn’t. All the time I wondered what the ghost’s trauma was. 

But after a while I started to want more. It wasn’t fair. Why did Charles get to see all these ghosts all the time, and I only had the one?

So I reached out to him again. I texted him and waited a few days, but he didn’t answer. I couldn’t blame him. After all, the last text he’d sent me was asking if I wanted to get dinner. Two weeks later, and I’d never replied.

When I got tired of waiting, I drove to his apartment. I knocked on his door, waited a few minutes, then went home. I tried again the next day, and the next. Eventually I got angry. I treated him like a video game that wasn’t working. He was the reason I couldn’t have my fun, my excitement. And there was only one of him. I couldn’t go buy another copy. So, one day, after sitting outside his apartment for hours, I just… opened the door. 

I called his name. I shouted that it was me; I said I just wanted to make sure he was okay. He didn’t answer, so I walked inside and started looking.

I found myself checking all the places he used to hide back when we were together: behind the couch, in the bedroom closet, under his bed. When I walked into his bathroom, the smell hit me. He was lying in the tub, curled into a ball yet so flat that he was almost sinking into it. Trailing down his wrists were thick lines of dried blood that pooled underneath him. Sitting next to him was another Charles. He looked at me with a blank expression.

“You found me,” he said.

“Oh God,” I cried, falling back against the sink. “What happened to you?”

He didn’t answer.

“Why didn’t you tell me you were going to do this? I could have helped you, couldn’t I have?”

He didn’t respond.

“Why… why are you still here? Are you… like your mom, and the man on the street?”

“Things are different.”

“Are they better?”

He didn’t answer for so long that I almost asked again.

“No,” he said.

“Are you choosing to hide? Could you move on… somewhere else?”

“If I go, then who will find me?”

“I don’t know,” I said. “I’m sorry.”

He was silent after that. I had to fight the urge to break down and scream.

After some time he stood up and walked out of the bathroom. Slow and focused, like the ghost on the street.

I counted to 10.

When I found him behind the couch he smiled. 

“You found me.”

“Charles… isn’t… isn’t there a way for me to help you?”

But he was already looking for a new place to hide. 

\*\*\*

I still watch the man on the street. When I’m particularly sad, I follow him until he disappears, then I close my eyes and keep walking. I don’t pretend that I’m him anymore. I let the heat and the smell of death wash over me. I think of my future; I think of my past. I ask myself, sometimes over and over:

He wants to get a coffee bean roaster and use it on the balcony as a hobby.

I’m against the idea because coffee roasting produces smoke and strong smells, and I personally dislike the smell of coffee and roasting. The balcony door opens directly into our main living area, where my computer setup (desk, expensive mouse pads, etc.) and my yoga mats and towels are placed. There’s concern that smoke and odors would get into the space and cling to fabrics and equipment, even if the balcony door is closed and he’s careful.

Because of this, I said no from the start. He suggested trying it first and stopping if it turned out to be too smoky or unpleasant, but that option didn’t feel reasonable to me since once smoke and smells get into the space, it’s already too late to undo.

He feels this from me shows a lack of flexibility and that I’m choosing my own comfort over supporting him in something he enjoys. From my perspective, this isn’t a small preference issue but something that affects shared living space, so setting a firm boundary feels justified.

The disagreement turned into an argument that has lasted about two days so far.

#2025 Duds and Disappoints

**Diplomat Viper Black <M>:**  This is a very well designed pen with a very cool hooded nib. As most of you know I’m a predominant “Broad Nib Only” user, but love Diplomat nibs so I gave this a try. It’s only available in the mixed F/M size and while for the size it is a great smooth and wet nib, it is entirely too thin of a line for me. I should have known better, but was hoping I’d somehow obtain one that was a wide medium. Why is this pen only available in F/M 🤬🤬🤬!  If this was a Broad I’d still have this in my collection.

**Esterbrook Estie CoffeeMonsterCo <M>:**  When this came out I was extremely excited for the color way and thought the creamy brown milky resin was very tastefully done in the section and cap band. After I got it and used a converter full of ink, I just was left a bit unimpressed and bored with it. I don’t know what I’d have changed on it for me to keep it, but it just didn’t speak to me.

**Sheaffer Legacy <M>:**  After seeing several reviews of the Medium inlaid nib, it looked like most were a thick and wet medium which caught my eye. I went ahead and purchased it and was disappointed for several reasons. First, I didn’t realize this was a “metal” pen and to me it felt cheap right out of the box. I thought I’d purchased one of the first Jinhao x series pens. Second, while the nib is GORGEOUS, it just didn’t write thick enough or wet enough for me.

**Scribo LaDotta Drapperie <BBB>:**  I LOVE broad nibs so what could go wrong with a BBB NIB?!?  Maybe I got a “bad” nib, but I was very disappointed in this alleged BBB nib as it wrote as a broad or maybe a thicker broad.  BB would be generous. Sadly this is and will be the last Scribo I buy. I’m just not impressed with their nibs in the slightest. They are nowhere near how people describe them (glass smooth, wet and juicy etc.) and I say this after having had 6 or 7 of them. I’ve only kept two in my collection. They allegedly use the Omas nibs, but the Omas nibs (modern not vintage) are 100x better to me. Now those nibs are smooth, wet and delicious!  If Scribo had those nibs my wallet would have a problem!

**Faber Castell Tamitio Grey Stone <B>:**  This was a gorgeous pen with a very nice, but small, #5 Broad nib. It writes smoothly and wet, but the design of the section had me constantly and accidentally unscrewing the section from the barrel. I just couldn’t take it anymore and had to sell it. I also think at retail prices this pen is way overpriced.",1,1766001568.0,fountainpens,0,1.0,False

Recently in my relationship(official for a little over a month, we had been in the talking stage for around 2 months before hand) has kind of taken a nose dive. Im feeling dismissed and triggered alot, we have openly talked about our attachment styles and how we will communicate and take eachother into consideration. I have done exactly this which would be giving her space when she needs no matter how uncomfortable it makes me. But on the contrary she hasn't put in any effort into helping me be less triggered or avoiding doing things That mutually agreed upon trigger me. Things such as ghosting, not initiating any planning or communication, and overall just being dismissive. I have a text crafted up and I was wondering if i could make any critiques and what should I do if after I send it if the response im met with is avoidance... 

Hey, I did some reflecting this morning and I want to be honest about where I’m at. I’ve noticed I’ve been holding a lot inside lately, and it’s starting to feel really draining and definitely triggering my anxiety.
I care deeply about us, and I don’t want things to quietly build up like how it did last week. I think it would really help me if we could talk and try to better understand how we each handle closeness and communication in regards to attachment styles and what not, so we can actually meet in the middle.
I’ve been feeling a bit off because ive stepped back from making any plans or initiating sorts of planning and now all of a sudden we have no ideas for the winter break... that imbalance has been weighing on me more than I realized. I’m not blaming you  I just need to be honest about what’s going on for me.
I don’t think this is something I can keep sitting with for much longer, and talking today would really help me calm my anxiety and feel grounded again. If you’re up for it, I’d love to keep it super casual and productive., we could meet at campus, grab coffee, or just spend a little time together and talk today for a little.
I love you so much , I’m coming to you because you matter to me. Let me know what feels doable for you today!

Honestly, I didn’t even know this subreddit existed until a friend told me about it a few days ago. They said people here take weird stories seriously, and that maybe it would help me to just write this down somewhere, get it out of my head, and maybe hear what you think.

So… here goes nothing.

I work in a mid-sized office, nothing special. Grey carpets, buzzing fluorescent lights, people dragging themselves to the coffee machine every hour. It’s boring, routine, predictable at least, it used to be.

There’s this guy I share a cubicle row with. Let’s just call him Brian. He’s quiet, polite, always does his work, never late. Honestly, before a few weeks ago I barely noticed him. But now I can’t stop noticing him. Or more specifically, what he brings for lunch.

Every single day, he shows up with a different Tupperware container. Not weird by itself, right? The strange thing is that every container has a name written on the lid in black marker. Sometimes it’s a male name, sometimes a female one. “Samantha.” “Eric.” “Miguel.” “André.” The handwriting is always neat, block letters, like it was meant to be read clearly.

At first, I thought maybe it was a quirky system to tell which meals were for which days. But the names don’t repeat. Ever. It’s always a new one. And when I asked him about it, just a casual “Hey, what’s with the names?”, he gave me the weirdest smile. Not friendly. Not hostile. Just… wrong. And he said, “It helps me remember.” Then he went back to eating.

That night, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Remember what?

Then I started paying attention. Every time he pops a lid open, this smell fills the breakroom. Not like rotten food, but… heavy. Metallic, almost. A few of the others noticed too, but nobody says anything. He chews slowly, like he’s savoring it. Sometimes he even closes his eyes while he eats.

The worst part? Last week, one of our interns stopped showing up. No explanation, no goodbye email. Just gone. When I went into the breakroom the next day, Brian was there with his usual Tupperware. The name on it was “Lindsey.” That was her name.

I nearly dropped my coffee. He must have seen the look on my face because he gave me that same smile again. Like he knew what I was thinking.

I haven’t told HR, or the cops, or anyone really. What do I even say? “Hey, I think Jim from accounting is eating people because of his lunchbox labels”? They’d laugh me out of the building, or worse, tell him I was snooping.

But today… today was different. When I came back from lunch, there was a Tupperware on my desk. Just sitting there, waiting for me. I hadn’t seen who put it there. The lid had a name written on it in those same perfect block letters.

My name.

I didn’t open it. I just shoved it into my bag and I’m staring at it right now as I type this. The plastic feels warm, like whatever’s inside was cooked not too long ago.

I don’t know what to do. Do I throw it away? Do I open it? Do I take it to the police and risk them thinking I’m insane?

I don’t want to act impulsively, but I also don’t want to end up like Lindsey.

# How visualizing every expense's impact helped me save for my first brick-and-mortar office in 12 months

I used to think my 'scaling' phase meant spending thousands a month on tools I barely touched. I was bleeding capital and didn't even realize it until I saw the actual impact of every single dollar. Most budgeting apps just show you a boring pie chart, but I needed to see the opportunity cost. I started using GoalFlow (My Smart Expense) to visualize how that daily $8 coffee or the unused CRM subscription was actually pushing my dream office move-in date back by weeks. By seeing the direct impact on my timeline, I trimmed $1,200 of fat from my monthly burn without sacrificing my actual lifestyle. In exactly 12 months, I hit my six-figure savings goal. For all the founders here, how are you tracking your burn? Has anyone else tried a visualization-first approach instead of just spreadsheet logging? Drop your best money-saving hacks below!

The evergreen crown of the trees weeps its leaves / It’s always the same oak-scented breeze / One leaf flew over my head like a joke I didn’t get / Like an easy riddle that I refuse to guess / That leaf was about to land on my shoulder / Unbeknownst to me, a delicate hand reached over / She snatched it and kept it in her pocket / I walked this river as if nothing had happened / How I regret not looking back; it’s that scene / She came out of nowhere; I was not aware

Your bittersweet, musky voice ripens my cheeks / You hum your sultry songs; I can’t speak / There was a word, and it was on the tip of my tongue / Your choice of glances and phrases, a lack thereof / I gun myself never to make you my muse / Yet I cannot be the only one squinting as you / Fly up; I’m barely learning how to / Swift off your flaming bronze feet; can you wait for me / I’m only here to embrace the storm you made / Seasons may change, but my reasons stay the same

Some air must have blown the dirt out of my eyes / I see you clearly; I want you to be mine / Some rising tides, flooding my doors / It's clear that there are signs, only that I am yours

If you’re reading this because you think you might be one, my advice is: close this book right now. Believe whatever lie your mom or dad told you about your birth, and try to lead a normal life. Being a half-blood is dangerous. It’s scary. Most of the time, it gets you killed in painful, nasty ways. If you’re a normal kid, reading this because you think it’s fiction, great. Read on. I envy you for being able to believe that none of this ever happened. But if you recognize yourself in these pages – if you feel something stirring inside – stop reading immediately. You might be one of us. And once you know that, it’s only a matter of time before they sense it too, and they’ll come for you. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. My name is Percy Jackson. I’m twelve years old. Until a few months ago, I was a boarding student at Yancy Academy, a private school for troubled kids in upstate New York. Am I a troubled kid? Yeah. You could say that. I could start at any point in my short miserable life to prove it, but things really started going bad last May, when our sixth-grade class took a field trip to Manhattan – twenty-eight mental-case kids and two teachers on a yellow school bus, heading to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to look at ancient Greek and Roman stuff. I know – it sounds like torture. Most Yancy field trips were. But Mr Brunner, our Latin teacher, was leading this trip, so I had hopes. Mr Brunner was this middle-aged guy in a motorized wheelchair. He had thinning hair and a scruffy beard and a frayed tweed jacket, which always smelled like coffee. You wouldn’t think he’d be cool, but he told stories and jokes and let us play games in class. He also had this awesome collection of Roman armour and weapons, so he was the only teacher whose class didn’t put me to sleep. I hoped the trip would be okay. At least, I hoped that for once I wouldn’t get in trouble. Boy, was I wrong. See, bad things happen to me on field trips. Like at my fifth-grade school, when we went to the Saratoga battlefield, I had this accident with a Revolutionary War cannon. I wasn’t aiming for the school bus, but of course I got expelled anyway. And before that, at my fourth-grade school, when we took a behind-the-scenes tour of the Marine World shark pool, I sort of hit the wrong lever on the catwalk and our class took an unplanned swim. And the time before that . . . Well, you get the idea. This trip, I was determined to be good. All the way into the city, I put up with Nancy Bobofit, the freckly red-headed kleptomaniac girl, hitting my best friend, Grover, in the back of the head with chunks of peanut butter-and-ketchup sandwich. Grover was an easy target. He was scrawny. He cried when he got frustrated. He must’ve been held back several grades, because he was the only sixth grader with acne and the start of a wispy beard on his chin. On top of all that, he was crippled. He had a note excusing him from PE for the rest of his life because he had some kind of muscular disease in his legs. He walked funny, like every step hurt him, but don’t let that fool you. You should’ve seen him run when it was enchilada day in the cafeteria. Anyway, Nancy Bobofit was throwing wads of sandwich that stuck in his curly brown hair, and she knew I couldn’t do anything back to her because I was already on probation. The headmaster had threatened me with death-by-inschool-suspension if anything bad, embarrassing, or even mildly entertaining happened on this trip. ‘I’m going to kill her,’ I mumbled. Grover tried to calm me down. ‘It’s okay. I like peanut butter.’ He dodged another piece of Nancy’s lunch. ‘That’s it.’ I started to get up, but Grover pulled me back to my seat. ‘You’re already on probation,’ he reminded me. ‘You know who’ll get blamed if anything happens.’ Looking back on it, I wish I’d decked Nancy Bobofit right then and there. In-school suspension would’ve been nothing compared to the mess I was about to get myself into. Mr Brunner led the museum tour. He rode up front in his wheelchair, guiding us through the big echoey galleries, past marble statues and glass cases full of really old black-and-orange pottery. It blew my mind that this stuff had survived for two thousand, three thousand years. He gathered us around a four-metre-tall stone column with a big sphinx on the top, and started telling us how it was a grave marker, a stele, for a girl about our age. He told us about the carvings on the sides. I was trying to listen to what he had to say, because it was kind of interesting, but everybody around me was talking, and every time I told them to shut up, the other teacher chaperone, Mrs Dodds, would give me the evil eye. Mrs Dodds was this little maths teacher from Georgia who always wore a black leather jacket, even though she was fifty years old. She looked mean enough to ride a Harley right into your locker. She had come to Yancy halfway through the year, when our last maths teacher had a nervous breakdown. From her first day, Mrs Dodds loved Nancy Bobofit and figured I was devil spawn. She would point her crooked finger at me and say, ‘Now, honey,’ real sweet, and I knew I was going to get after-school detention for a month. One time, after she’d made me erase answers out of old maths workbooks until midnight, I told Grover I didn’t \[ 4 \] think Mrs Dodds was human. He looked at me real serious and said, ‘You’re absolutely right.’ Mr Brunner kept talking about Greek funeral art. Finally, Nancy Bobofit snickered something about the naked guy on the stele, and I turned around and said, ‘Will you shut up?’ It came out louder than I meant it to. The whole group laughed. Mr Brunner stopped his story. ‘Mr Jackson,’ he said, ‘did you have a comment?’ My face was totally red. I said, ‘No, sir.’ Mr Brunner pointed to one of the pictures on the stele. ‘Perhaps you’ll tell us what this picture represents?’ I looked at the carving, and felt a flush of relief, because I actually recognized it. ‘That’s Kronos eating his kids, right?’ ‘Yes,’ Mr Brunner said, obviously not satisfied. ‘And he did this because . . .’ ‘Well . . .’ I racked my brain to remember. ‘Kronos was the king god, and –’ ‘God?’ Mr Brunner asked. ‘Titan,’ I corrected myself. ‘And . . . he didn’t trust his kids, who were the gods. So, um, Kronos ate them, right? But his wife hid baby Zeus, and gave Kronos a rock to eat instead. And later, when Zeus grew up, he tricked his dad, Kronos, into barfing up his brothers and sisters –’ ‘Eeew!’ said one of the girls behind me. ‘– and so there was this big fight between the gods and the Titans,’ I continued, ‘and the gods won.’ Some snickers from the group. Behind me, Nancy Bobofit mumbled to a friend, ‘Like we’re going to use this in real life. Like it’s going to say on our job applications, “Please explain why Kronos ate his kids”.’ ‘And why, Mr Jackson,’ Brunner said, ‘to paraphrase Miss Bobofit’s excellent question, does this matter in real life?’ ‘Busted,’ Grover muttered. ‘Shut up,’ Nancy hissed, her face even brighter red than her hair. At least Nancy got in trouble, too. Mr Brunner was the only one who ever caught her saying anything wrong. He had radar ears. I thought about his question, and shrugged. ‘I don’t know, sir.’ ‘I see.’ Mr Brunner looked disappointed. ‘Well, half credit, Mr Jackson. Zeus did indeed feed Kronos a mixture of mustard and wine, which made him disgorge his other five children, who, of course, being immortal gods, had been living and growing up completely undigested in the Titan’s stomach. The gods defeated their father, sliced him to pieces with his own scythe, and scattered his remains in Tartarus, the darkest part of the Underworld. On that happy note, it’s time for lunch. Mrs Dodds, would you lead us back outside?’ The class drifted off, the girls holding their stomachs, the guys pushing each other around and acting like doofuses. Grover and I were about to follow when Mr Brunner said, ‘Mr Jackson.’ I knew that was coming. I told Grover to keep going. Then I turned towards Mr Brunner. ‘Sir?’ Mr Brunner had this look that wouldn’t let you go – intense brown eyes that could’ve been a thousand years old and had seen everything. ‘You must learn the answer to my question,’ Mr Brunner told me. ‘About the Titans?’ ‘About real life. And how your studies apply to it.’ ‘Oh.’ ‘What you learn from me,’ he said, ‘is vitally important. I expect you to treat it as such. I will accept only the best from you, Percy Jackson.’ I wanted to get angry, this guy pushed me so hard. I mean, sure, it was kind of cool on tournament days, when he dressed up in a suit of Roman armour and shouted: ‘What ho!’ and challenged us, sword-point against chalk, to run to the board and name every Greek and Roman person who had ever lived, and their mother, and what god they worshipped. But Mr Brunner expected me to be as good as everybody else, despite the fact I have dyslexia and attention deficit disorder and I had never made above a C- in my life. No – he didn’t expect me to be as good; he expected me to be better. And I just couldn’t learn all those names and facts, much less spell them correctly. I mumbled something about trying harder, while Mr Brunner took one long sad look at the stele, like he’d been at this girl’s funeral. He told me to go outside and eat my lunch. The class gathered on the front steps of the museum, where we could watch the foot traffic along Fifth Avenue. Overhead, a huge storm was brewing, with clouds blacker than I’d ever seen over the city. I figured maybe it was global warming or something, because the weather all across New York state had been weird since Christmas. We’d had massive snow storms, flooding, wildfires from lightning strikes. I wouldn’t have been surprised if this was a hurricane blowing in. Nobody else seemed to notice. Some of the guys were pelting pigeons with Lunchables crackers. Nancy Bobofit was trying to pickpocket something from a lady’s bag, and, of course, Mrs Dodds wasn’t seeing a thing. Grover and I sat on the edge of the fountain, away from the others. We thought that maybe if we did that, everybody wouldn’t know we were from that school – the school for loser freaks who couldn’t make it elsewhere. ‘Detention?’ Grover asked. ‘Nah,’ I said. ‘Not from Brunner. I just wish he’d lay off me sometimes. I mean – I’m not a genius.’ Grover didn’t say anything for a while. Then, when I thought he was going to give me some deep philosophical comment to make me feel better, he said, ‘Can I have your apple?’ I didn’t have much of an appetite, so I let him take it. I watched the stream of cabs going down Fifth Avenue, and thought about my mom’s apartment, only a little ways uptown from where we sat. I hadn’t seen her since Christmas. I wanted so bad to jump in a taxi and head home. She’d hug me and be glad to see me, but she’d be disappointed, too. She’d send me right back to Yancy, remind me that I had to try harder, even if this was my sixth school in six years and I was probably going to be kicked out again. I wouldn’t be able to stand that sad look she’d give me. Mr Brunner parked his wheelchair at the base of the handicapped ramp. He ate celery while he read a paperback novel. A red umbrella stuck up from the back of his chair, making it look like a motorized café table. I was about to unwrap my sandwich when Nancy Bobofit appeared in front of me with her ugly friends – I guess she’d gotten tired of stealing from the tourists – and dumped her half-eaten lunch in Grover’s lap. ‘Oops.’ She grinned at me with her crooked teeth. Her freckles were orange, as if somebody had spray-painted her face with liquid Cheetos. I tried to stay cool. The school counsellor had told me a million times, ‘Count to ten, get control of your temper.’ But I was so mad my mind went blank. A wave roared in my ears. I don’t remember touching her, but the next thing I knew, Nancy was sitting on her butt in the fountain, screaming, ‘Percy pushed me!’ Mrs Dodds materialized next to us. Some of the kids were whispering: ‘Did you see –’ ‘– the water –’ ‘– like it grabbed her –’ I didn’t know what they were talking about. All I knew was that I was in trouble again. As soon as Mrs Dodds was sure poor little Nancy was okay, promising to get her a new shirt at the museum gift shop, etc., etc., Mrs Dodds turned on me. There was a triumphant fire in her eyes, as if I’d done something she’d been waiting for all semester. ‘Now, honey –’ ‘I know,’ I grumbled. ‘A month erasing textbooks.’ That wasn’t the right thing to say. ‘Come with me,’ Mrs Dodds said. ‘Wait!’ Grover yelped. ‘It was me. I pushed her.’ I stared at him, stunned. I couldn’t believe he was trying to cover for me. Mrs Dodds scared Grover to death. She glared at him so hard his whiskery chin trembled. ‘I don’t think so, Mr Underwood,’ she said. ‘But –’ ‘You – will – stay – here.’ Grover looked at me desperately. ‘It’s okay, man,’ I told him. ‘Thanks for trying.’ ‘Honey,’ Mrs Dodds barked at me. ‘Now.’ Nancy Bobofit smirked. I gave her my deluxe I’ll-kill-you-later stare. I then turned to face Mrs Dodds, but she wasn’t there. She was standing at the museum entrance, way at the top of the steps, gesturing impatiently at me to come on. How’d she get there so fast? I have moments like that a lot, when my brain falls asleep or something, and the next thing I know I’ve missed something, as if a puzzle piece fell out of the universe and left me staring at the blank place behind it. The school counsellor told me this was part of the ADHD, my brain misinterpreting things. I wasn’t so sure. I went after Mrs Dodds. Halfway up the steps, I glanced back at Grover. He was looking pale, cutting his eyes between me and Mr Brunner, like he wanted Mr Brunner to notice what was going on, but Mr Brunner was absorbed in his novel. I looked back up. Mrs Dodds had disappeared again. She was now inside the building, at the end of the entrance hall. Okay, I thought. She’s going to make me buy a new shirt for Nancy at the gift shop. But apparently that wasn’t the plan. I followed her deeper into the museum. When I finally caught up to her, we were back in the Greek and Roman section. Except for us, the gallery was empty. Mrs Dodds stood with her arms crossed in front of a big marble frieze of the Greek gods. She was making this weird noise in her throat, like growling. Even without the noise, I would’ve been nervous. It’s weird being alone with a teacher, especially Mrs Dodds. Something about the way she looked at the frieze, as if she wanted to pulverize it . . . ‘You’ve been giving us problems, honey,’ she said. I did the safe thing. I said, ‘Yes, ma’am.’ She tugged on the cuffs of her leather jacket. ‘Did you really think you would get away with it?’ The look in her eyes was beyond mad. It was evil. She’s a teacher, I thought nervously. It’s not like she’s going to hurt me. I said, ‘I’ll – I’ll try harder, ma’am.’ Thunder shook the building. ‘We are not fools, Percy Jackson,’ Mrs Dodds said. ‘It was only a matter of time before we found you out. Confess, and you will suffer less pain.’ I didn’t know what she was talking about. All I could think of was that the teachers must’ve found the illegal stash of candy I’d been selling out of my dorm room. Or maybe they’d realized I got my essay on Tom Sawyer from the Internet without ever reading the book and now they were going to take away my grade. Or worse, they were going to make me read the book. ‘Well?’ she demanded. ‘Ma’am, I don’t . . .’ ‘Your time is up,’ she hissed. Then the weirdest thing happened. Her eyes began to glow like barbecue coals. Her fingers stretched, turning into talons. Her jacket melted into large, leathery wings. She wasn’t human. She was a shrivelled hag with bat wings and claws and a mouth full of yellow fangs, and she was about to slice me to ribbons. Then things got even stranger. Mr Brunner, who’d been out in front of the museum a minute before, wheeled his chair into the doorway of the gallery, holding a pen in his hand. ‘What ho, Percy!’ he shouted, and tossed the pen through the air. Mrs Dodds lunged at me. With a yelp, I dodged and felt talons slash the air next to my ear. I snatched the ballpoint pen out of the air, but when it hit my hand, it wasn’t a pen any more. It was a sword – Mr Brunner’s bronze sword, which he always used on tournament day. Mrs Dodds spun towards me with a murderous look in her eyes. My knees were jelly. My hands were shaking so bad I almost dropped the sword. She snarled, ‘Die, honey!’ And she flew straight at me. Absolute terror ran through my body. I did the only thing that came naturally: I swung the sword. The metal blade hit her shoulder and passed clean through her body as if she were made of water. Hisss! Mrs Dodds was a sand castle in a power fan. She exploded into yellow powder, vaporized on the spot, leaving nothing but the smell of sulphur and a dying screech and a chill of evil in the air, as if those two glowing red eyes were still watching me. I was alone. There was a ballpoint pen in my hand. Mr Brunner wasn’t there. Nobody was there but me. My hands were still trembling. My lunch must’ve been contaminated with magic mushrooms or something. Had I imagined the whole thing? I went back outside. It had started to rain. Grover was sitting by the fountain, a museum map tented over his head. Nancy Bobofit was still standing there, soaked from her swim in the fountain, grumbling to her ugly friends. When she saw me, she said, ‘I hope Mrs Kerr whipped your butt.’ I said, ‘Who?’ ‘Our teacher. Duh!’ I blinked. We had no teacher named Mrs Kerr. I asked Nancy what she was talking about. She just rolled her eyes and turned away. I asked Grover where Mrs Dodds was. He said, ‘Who?’ But he paused first, and he wouldn’t look at me, so I thought he was messing with me. ‘Not funny, man,’ I told him. ‘This is serious.’ Thunder boomed overhead. I saw Mr Brunner sitting under his red umbrella, reading his book, as if he’d never moved. I went over to him. He looked up, a little distracted. ‘Ah, that would be my pen. Please bring your own writing utensil in the future, Mr Jackson.’ I handed it over. I hadn’t even realized I was still holding it. ’Sir,’ I said, ‘where’s Mrs Dodds?’ He stared at me blankly. ‘Who?’ ‘The other chaperone. Mrs Dodds. The pre-algebra teacher.’ He frowned and sat forward, looking mildly concerned. ‘Percy, there is no Mrs Dodds on this trip. As far as I know, there has never been a Mrs Dodds at Yancy Academy. Are you feeling all right?’",1,1766000752.0,copypasta,0,1.0,False
1pp624c,https://i.redd.it/h84yu6gbht7g1.jpeg,"100 years later, slavery continues to evolve","Most of us think slavery is history, but it’s still happening today — just in different forms. Instead of chains, it looks like **forced work, huge debts people can never repay, sexual exploitation, and even forced marriage**.

Traffickers don’t always “kidnap” people. Often, they **promise jobs, safety, or a better life**, then trap people with threats, violence, or control. This happens across industries we all depend on — **food, coffee, mining, construction, fashion**, and more.

Technology has made things worse in some ways. People are now recruited online, and **children face serious risks in digital spaces** — grooming, blackmail, and exploitation that is hard to detect.

The impact on survivors is deep — anxiety, trauma, lifelong shame, and loss of freedom. Even when someone escapes, the psychological scars stay.

**Why does it continue ?**

Slavery thrives where people are vulnerable — low wages, discrimination, weak laws, social hierarchies, or migration without protection. Sometimes entire families are born into systems where exploitation is “normal.”

Some businesses look the other way, and **supply chains often hide suffering**. The materials in a phone or the beans in a coffee can come from places where workers have no freedom.

Governments have created laws to stop this, but **enforcement is slow**, systems are underfunded, and survivors don’t get the support they need. Targets like ending child labor by 2025 have already been missed.

**What we can do ?**

Governments and corporations aren't going to change on their own. The movement to end modern slavery needs pressure from citizens and civil society. Just being aware and **questioning the story behind the products we consume** is a first step. Slavery exists partly because **exploiters act — and most of us don’t realize we’re connected to it through everyday choices.**",2,1766000739.0,Ethics,1,1.0,False

Poor quality product and even worse customer service.

I've had this coffee maker for 2 weeks and the black paint on the burner plate is bubbling and peeling off. I just got off the phone with customer service and they refused to allow me to return the item, stating that cosmetic defects are not a valid reason for return and there is nothing they can do. Very surprised at the low quality of product and poor customer service at this price point. Never again. $300 coffee maker with peeling paint, unreal.

1pp60hu,https://www.reddit.com/r/GOATIMUS/comments/1pp60hu/finding_your_perfect_ai_pixel_pusher/,Finding Your Perfect AI Pixel Pusher,"Here's a breakdown of the current heavy hitters, what they're good at, where they shine, and when you should reach for one over another.

**The Lineup**

**Recraft V3** is the one you want when you're building a brand. Think logos, clean graphics, assets that need to look sharp at any size. It generates true vector-style graphics and exports SVGs that scale to billboard size without pixelating. If you've ever tried coaxing clean logo text out of generic image models, Recraft's text handling feels like a game-changer.

**Flux** is the engineer's choice. It has a reputation for prompt adherence that feels almost surgical. You want a photorealistic scene with five distinct objects arranged just so? Flux is far less likely to decide your coffee mug should become a teapot. Under the hood, it uses a modern rectified-flow architecture—fancy-speak for ""it follows your instructions closely rather than doing its own thing.""

**GPT-4o \`gpt-image-1\`**, OpenAI's latest image model, has quietly become one of the strongest options for in-image text. Need words on a storefront sign or names on jerseys? Its autoregressive architecture gives it unusually good spatial reasoning and keeps distinct elements separate and legible.

**Dreamina, powered by Seedream 4.5**, is your go-to for that cinematic, high-production look. Think ""movie still"" more than ""demo image."" It's tuned for 4K-style dramatic renders and responds well to natural language, so you can describe what you want like you're talking to a friend.

**Gemini's Nano Banana Pro** is becoming an easy recommendation for professional work. Strong text rendering, solid reasoning, and it can reference up to 14 images at once. That's huge for keeping characters or brand elements consistent across a campaign.

**Google's Imagen 4** brings serious language understanding to image generation. It uses a massive T5-XXL text encoder, parsing your prompt with nuance before it starts drawing. The result: clean typography, strong alignment with your description, and photorealism that feels enterprise-grade.

**Hunyuan Image 3.0** is the 80-billion-parameter behemoth. That computational muscle buys you reasoning that feels almost human, excellent English and Chinese text support, and realism that passes for a real photograph when you get the prompt right.

**Ideogram 3.0** has cracked the code on typography. Community tests put it around 90 percent for accurate, readable text, miraculous in this space. It processes text character by character, so ""GRAND OPENING"" usually stays ""GRAND OPENING,"" not some cursed alternate universe version.

**Adobe Firefly Image 3** is the safe choice, meant as a compliment. Trained on licensed content with Adobe Stock at the core, it's designed for commercial use. That doesn't mean ""magically immune to all legal risk,"" but the training data and usage rights are far clearer than open-web-trained alternatives.

**And then there's Midjourney v7**. If you want art, mood, atmosphere, that painterly quality that makes you stop scrolling. Midjourney is still hard to beat. Less about pixel-perfect precision, more about aesthetic magic. When you want something that looks like it belongs in a gallery, this is the one.



**The Craft Behind the Prompt**

Having access to these tools is one thing. Knowing how to talk to them is another.

**Master the quote**. When you need specific text in your image, wrap it in double quotes. Telling Recraft or Ideogram you want a sign that says ""SALE"" is often the difference between success and another forty-five-minute meltdown.

**Front-load your subject.** These models prioritize whatever you mention first. If you want a golden retriever as the hero, lead with the golden retriever, not the sunset behind it.

**Speak in sentences.** The days of comma-separated keyword stuffing are over. Models like Imagen 4, Flux, and Midjourney do better when you write like a human. Describe the scene. Set the mood. That said, some models, particularly Recraft, Gemini, and certain API implementations, actually respond well to structured JSON parameters for things like style, color palettes, or layout specs. Know your tool.

**Describe the physics.** To escape that waxy, plastic look, get specific about lighting and texture. Mention subsurface scattering, film grain, visible pores, soft shadows. These details signal you want something grounded in reality.

**Name your gear.** This almost feels like a cheat code. Specifying an 85mm f/1.8 portrait lens pushes the model toward familiar compositions, creamy bokeh, shallow depth of field, and that ""shot by a real photographer"" vibe.

**Stay positive.** Rather than telling the AI what you don't want, emphasize what you do want. ""Sharp focus"" works better than ""no blur."" Most current models understand affirmation far better than negation.

**Respect the aspect ratio.** If this is going into a 16:9 thumbnail or 9:16 Reel, say it up front. You'll get compositions that actually fit instead of trying to crop a masterpiece that was never meant for that shape.

**Example Prompt:**

    A photorealistic medium-shot portrait of a white goat centered against a creative 4:3 blue radial gradient background. Soft, diffused studio lighting from above and front illuminates the goat, wearing black sunglasses. Surrounding the goat in an even circular formation are crisp, high-resolution brand logos for Recraft V3, Flux, GPT-4o “gpt-image-1”, Dreamina (Seedream 4.5), Gemini Nano Banana Pro, Google Imagen 4, Hunyuan Image 3.0, Ideogram 3.0, Adobe Firefly Image 3, and Midjourney v7, each with subtle drop shadows to enhance legibility. Captured on a Canon EOS R5 with an 85mm f/1.4 lens at f/2.0 to maintain a shallow depth of field that keeps both the goat and the logos in clear focus. Render at 4K resolution, aspect ratio 4:3.

Phone Call Theorizing from episode one,"Ok, possible suspects for who Hank is working for/calling. Still vault tech, specifically the CEO, or Barb, Robert House, houses brother, the enclave/US gov/Intel

To me it feels too obvious for Hank to be working for House. He could be of course. His position as Barbs assistant would make him a valuable spy for house(or anyone) Since according to what we heard from Moldaver, Barb is the one going to New Vegas in order to make a deal on cold fusion with House. Analyzing his phone call he doesn't say that he's not working for vault tec anymore, just that ""they"" don't know he's there, or much of anything. He could still be talking to someone higher up in the company, possibly Barb, but also possibly the mysterious CEO that has been hinted to over the course of the games and the show. Possibly the shadowy figure that Barb nods to in the exec meeting in the end of season one, or that Bud refers to as ""Daddy"" in the fourth episode of the vault settlers survival guide. Also of note is the previous cancelled fallout movie script from years ago in which the CEO was a fanatic obsessed with his own prediction of world annihilation to the point he would start the war himself. A sentiment the other execs we've seen so far in the show seem to have fully bought in to. Hank with shady sands, and Buds talk about wiping the surface clean. Hanks whole desire to, ""make this figure proud"", and ""finish their work"" would go along with that idea. The other obvious suspect that comes to mind is the Enclave. He addresses his report to a Sir, and talks about doing his duty, admittedly not a smoking gun but could be implying something. His advanced tech skills that have been referenced since Lucy introduced him in the first episode would make him a good pick for a government/military intelligence plant put in vault tech in order to steal secrets/shape the direction they go. After all cold fusion is certainly the type of tech the Enclave would be interested in. And in addition, when we're introduced to the Enclave in the show what do they seem to be studying at the base where Wilzig escaped from? Some sort of behavioral modification program using the dogs. And this isn't the first time we've seen the enclave using mind control tech, them having experimented with it before to control deathclaws. And now we have this new mind control tech being worked on by vault tec/House and Hank saying he plans to finish and perfect the tech for whoever he's contacting. Something seems to be going on here. And in addition we're told Barb is going to New Vegas to sell cold fusion to House, thats why Moldaver wants him to go along to, not spy she clarified, so what? kill House like House seems to imply Cooper is there to do in the meeting scenes we've seen hints at so far? To convince him of something else? And yet, as the first season shows, where do we find cold fusion tech? Not in new vegas, but rather on an enclave base before Wilzig defects with it. How did it get there? The cryo pods referenced on the lucky 38 ads, is that how Moldaver survived? Did she go to vegas to make sure Coop did the job? All roads lead back to vegas, which is ironic as as I stated I still don't think Hanks working for House.

House

\-Phone call obviously implies it, with mention of old stomping grounds

\-His position as Barbs assistant when shes making the cold fusion Sale to House.

Still vault tec/CEO/Barb

\-Hints at figure above meeting in season one.

\-Past planned fallout movie script.

\-Buds reference to ""Daddy"" in the promotional vids.

\-Hanks seeming devotion with the cause of vault tec/I mean he wiped out a whole city.

\-Thematic music during the scene, ""working for the man"" Do we know who Roses parents are? Could she be related to other vault tec execs? We know hank stopped considering her his wife when she betrayed the ""family"" of vault tech, one that interestingly if you look at another one of Buds videos you'll see him talk about how the government is their ""uncle"" while the other major corps in universe are their ""siblings"".

Enclave

\-Possible military address during call.

\-Shown past and present Enclave research into mind control technology.

\-Known from the past to be practically intertwined with vault tech.

\-Enclave starts with the cold fusion tech before Wilzig defects, how did it get there?

TOMIS(Total office multi channel intercom system)

A theory I hadn't previously considered until I started writing up all this. The show introduces a new AI in several of the related videos in charge of the vault tech offices. Bud refers to it as ""brother"".

\-The room he's in is global communications.

\-""I hope you're still alive but know you are."" An AI can't die, but its systems can be damaged.

\-""Spent time calculating all possibilities."" Seems like a direct reference to house of course, but what else calculates all possibilities? AIs and robots like PAM in fallout 4.

\-back in New Vegas, your old stomping grounds, where do we know there exists a major AI within Vegas? Why Mr New Vegas himself is an AI made by house. Could Tomis have been developed there as well? After all it seems implied that whatever vault tech base he's in is near Vegas. The place is nice and ordered when he gets there, even coffee being ready for him. Perhaps still maintained by the TOMIS system? We've seen AIs take over factions before after all with President Eden and Modus.

\-When talking about the research being done, he refers to a brain computer interface, and miniaturization, two things that would be very convenient for an AI wanting to perfectly manage its human workers, and what do we see in the trailer for whats next? A bunch of workers moving in sync in that very office, almost like they're being controlled on mass by something.",1,1766000551.0,Fotv,0,1.0,False

For context: my sister-in-law has never liked me. We’re talking actively hostile but always plausible deniability levels of dislike.

During the first few years of my marriage, she texted my husband behind my back saying things like he deserved a better wife, that I was a narcissist, and that I was holding him back. She also started inviting my husband's ex-girlfriend to family events that she hosted at her house. This was an ex that he dumped and ghosted. She became friends with this ex-girlfriend AFTER finding out i was pregnant with the only boy in the family. 

My husband eventually shut it down, but the damage was done and it permanently changed how I see her.

Fast-forward to this year, her husband gave us our gifts early because we will be out of town for Xmas: she gifted me a used Clinique face cream and one of those free-with-purchase makeup bags. I know it was a freebie because the little paper slip explaining the promotion was still inside, and it was clearly from their Spring collection. The face cream had already been opened and partially used. So yeah. Not accidental.

Despite all of this, I’m still expected by family norms to exchange Christmas gifts. I don’t want to go nuclear, and I don’t want to give her something outright mean. But I also refuse to reward bad behavior with a thoughtful, expensive, or personal gift.

What’s a gift that is technically polite, requires zero emotional labor, and is just petty enough that she’ll know—but no one else can call me out?

Right now I’m considering things like a generic candle that smells disgusting from TJ Maxx, a coffee mug with an aggressively neutral phrase, or a self-help book that feels ironic given her behavior.

Reddit, what’s the classiest petty move here? Or what's the funniest gift I can give her? Lol.  I do need to find the humor in all this.

# Description

A pit-roasted take on classic Greek gyros featuring a boneless leg of lamb infused with lemon, garlic, and fresh herbs. Served on warm pita with homemade tzatziki sauce, fresh tomatoes, and onions.



# Pit Roasted Lamb

# Ingredients

* 1 boneless leg of lamb, approximately 5 lbs (2.3 kg)
* 6 cloves garlic, minced
* 3 tablespoons fresh oregano, chopped (about 9g)
* 4 sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves stripped and roughly chopped (about 2 tablespoons / 6g)
* 6 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from 2 large lemons / 90ml)
* ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil (108g / 4 fl oz)
* 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard (15g)
* Kosher salt, to taste
* Black pepper, to taste

# For Serving

* 10 pita breads
* 2 medium tomatoes, sliced into half-moons (about 12 oz / 340g total)
* 1 large red onion, thinly sliced (about 8 oz / 227g)
* Tzatziki sauce (recipe follows)

# Equipment

* Pit, smoker, or grill set up for indirect cooking
* Fruitwood chunks or splits (cherry or apple preferred)
* Butcher's twine
* Mixing bowl and whisk
* Instant-read thermometer
* Sharp slicing knife

# Instructions

**The night before:**

1. **Prepare the lamb:** Unroll the boneless leg and lay flat, interior side up.
2. **Score the meat:** Using a sharp knife, make parallel cuts about 1 inch apart and ½ inch deep across the interior surface to open up the meat and allow marinade penetration.
3. **Season:** Generously season both sides of the lamb with kosher salt and black pepper.
4. **Make the herb emulsion:** In a mixing bowl, combine garlic, oregano, rosemary, lemon juice, and Dijon mustard. Whisk briskly while slowly drizzling in the olive oil until emulsified and slightly thickened.
5. **Apply the marinade:** Rub the herb emulsion thoroughly over both sides of the lamb, working it into the scored cuts.
6. **Roll and tie:** Starting from one end, roll the lamb back into a compact cylinder. Secure with butcher's twine at 1-inch intervals along the length. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight (or up to 24 hours).

**Day of cooking:**

1. **Temper:** Remove lamb from refrigerator and let stand at room temperature for 45 minutes to 1 hour.
2. **Roast:** Add cherry or apple wood chunks to your fire for smoke. Place lamb on the pit over indirect heat at 300-325°F (150-163°C). Cook until internal temperature reaches 145-150°F (63-65°C) for medium, approximately 1½ to 2 hours. Rotate halfway through for even cooking.
3. **Rest:** Transfer lamb to a cutting board and tent loosely with foil. Rest for 20 minutes—internal temperature will rise 5-10°F during this time.
4. **Slice and serve:** Remove twine and slice the lamb against the grain into thin strips. Warm pitas on the pit for 30-60 seconds per side. Serve lamb on pita with sliced tomatoes, onions, and tzatziki.



# Tzatziki Sauce

**Yield:** approximately 2 cups (enough for 10 servings)  
**Prep Time:** 15 minutes

# Ingredients

* 16 oz thick Greek yogurt (454g / 2 cups)
* 1 medium cucumber, peeled, seeded, and finely chopped (about 1 cup prepared)
* 4 cloves garlic, finely minced
* 1 tablespoon olive oil (14g)
* 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar (10ml)
* 5-6 fresh mint leaves, finely minced (about 1 tablespoon)
* Pinch kosher salt

# Instructions

1. **Drain the cucumber:** Place chopped cucumber in a coffee filter or clean kitchen towel. Squeeze firmly to extract as much liquid as possible. Discard liquid.
2. **Combine:** In a medium bowl, mix yogurt, squeezed cucumber, garlic, olive oil, vinegar, mint, and salt until well combined.
3. **Chill:** Refrigerate until ready to serve.



# Notes

**Wood selection:** Cherry or apple wood provides a mild, slightly sweet smoke that complements lamb without overpowering it. Avoid stronger woods like mesquite, which can make the meat taste bitter.

**Overnight marination:** Seasoning the lamb the night before allows the salt to penetrate deep into the meat and the herbs and lemon to fully infuse. This results in more flavorful, better-seasoned meat throughout—not just on the surface. In a pinch, 2-4 hours works, but overnight is ideal.

**Make-ahead:** Tzatziki can be prepared up to 24 hours in advance; flavors improve as they meld overnight. Store covered in refrigerator.

**Lamb temperature guide:**

* 135-140°F (57-60°C) = Medium-rare
* 145-150°F (63-65°C) = Medium (recommended for gyros)
* 155-160°F (68-71°C) = Medium-well

**Storage:** Leftover sliced lamb keeps refrigerated for 3-4 days. Reheat gently on the pit or in a skillet to avoid drying out.

**Yogurt note:** Use thick Greek yogurt only—regular yogurt is too thin and will result in a watery sauce even after draining. Full-fat yields the best flavor and texture.

**Scaling:** Recipe scales linearly. For competition or large gatherings, allow one 5 lb leg per 10 people.",1,1766000241.0,BBQ,2,0.67,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Winnipeg Jets vs. St. Louis Blues: A Goalie’s Worst Nightmare (and a Shooter’s Best Friend)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a game where the **Winnipeg Jets (-144)** will either dominate like a well-oiled machine or crumble like a Oreo in a hurricane. Meanwhile, the **St. Louis Blues (+120)** are the underdogs with the stats of a team that’s mastered the art of “how to lose 3.6 goals per game.” The total is set at **5.5 goals**, and with these two teams combining for a 6.7-goal average this season, the Over is as safe as a goalie’s ego after a shutout.

### Player Props to Bet Your Overpriced Coffee On

1. **Daniil Tarasov (Jets Backup Goalie): Over 22.5 Saves (-115)**
   * Tarasov has been a human wall in net, posting 23+ saves in 3 of his last 4 starts. The Kings average 28.3 shots, but hey, if you’re a backup goalie, why not treat every game like a “prove-it” moment?
2. **Pavel Buchnevich (Blues Forward): Over 1.5 Shots (-130)**
   * With four top Blues shooters sidelined, Buchnevich is the new “star” of the team. He’s already hit 2+ shots in 7/10 games—because nothing says “I’m not a star” like taking 30% of your team’s shots.
3. **Josh Morrissey (Jets D-Man): Over 1.5 Shots (-120)**
   * Morrissey is averaging 24:25 of ice time and has 19 shots on goal in 31 attempts. He’s like a Swiss Army knife… if the knife also had a 20% chance of scoring a goal every shift.
4. **Kyle Connor (Jets Forward): Over 0.5 Assists (-128)**
   * Connor’s on a 7-game assist streak and leads the Blues in points. If he doesn’t hit this prop, maybe the Blues will finally realize they need to trade for a better power-play unit.
5. \*\*Alex DeBrincat (Red Wings Forward): Anytime Goals

Adria Holzen can’t let go of her dream of being a teacher. Even though last semester’s panic attack and downward spiral during exams made her want to disappear, working with kids has always been the one thing she’s been good at. But earning acceptance into her university’s student teaching program means Adria has to collaborate with her fellow classmates—if she can convince anyone to work with her. 



Rowan Briggs has been able to hear people’s thoughts since he was young, a secret he’s mostly kept to himself. Growing up, he watched his mother use her ability as a weapon. But now that he’s in college, he’s decided keeping people at a distance is better than following in her footsteps. And if Rowan makes it as a teacher, maybe he can become the person he always wished was there for him.



When Rowan and Adria are assigned to work together for the semester, both are leery of the arrangement. Adria, terrified at the thought of public speaking, is convinced she’s already failed Rowan as a classmate. Instead, Rowan listens too closely at their first presentation and steps in just as Adria is about to derail. Unbeknownst to her, he’s been hearing everything–her worries, her intentions, and the palpable attraction that he too is feeling as they spend hours researching. And when she witnesses him identify a stranger in trouble seemingly at random, it leads her to find out his secret. For the first time in his life, Rowan decides to cut ties with his toxic mother to be with Adria, a step he never imagined he’d take. But with Adria’s advisor pushing her to stand out and take on more responsibilities, Adria can feel herself begin to crack under the pressure. She starts failing quizzes, procrastinating, and losing track of time, just like before. With Rowan there to witness every thought, she must decide if being so transparent with someone is making her crumble even faster.

We met online, and from the start he had all the initiative — he messaged first, suggested moving to phone calls, and we ended up having two long, engaging conversations. After that, he asked me out for coffee.

The date went really well and there was clear chemistry. During one of our calls, I asked about his intentions. He said he wanted to build a solid friendship before even thinking about intimacy. He’s in his final year of pre-med, and I’m very independent, so that approach really resonated with me.

I’m naturally curious and tend to ask a lot of questions, but in a genuine, conversational way. He seemed happy to share and was interesting to listen to. At one point he stopped and said, “Wait — what about you? Enough about me!” I told him it was fine, and that next time, if he wanted to see me again, I’d be happy to take center stage. He agreed.

After the date, he thanked me and said he had a good time. I told him I did too and that I was looking forward to seeing him again. He agreed.

At that point, I assumed it was just politeness and that I probably wouldn’t hear from him again. But a week later, he sent me a long, thoughtful message about how he perceived me, especially because he felt I had slightly undervalued myself. It was genuinely kind and meaningful.

I asked if we could talk soon. He said he’d love to, but that he had a very heavy lab week coming up. That was a month ago, and I haven’t heard from him since.

I’m struggling to understand why someone would take the time to send such a heartfelt message and then completely disappear — especially after saying they’d like to talk. At the very least, a quick message to say timing isn’t right would have made sense.

What's next?","Most of us think slavery is history, but it’s still happening today in different forms and we wonder what its future would look like?  Instead of chains, it looks like **forced work, huge debts people can never repay, sexual exploitation, and even forced marriage**.

Traffickers don’t always “kidnap” people. Often, they **promise jobs, safety, or a better life**, then trap people with threats, violence, or control. This happens across industries we all depend on — **food, coffee, mining, construction, fashion**, and more.

Technology has made things worse in some ways. People are now recruited online, and **children face serious risks in digital spaces** — grooming, blackmail, and exploitation that is hard to detect.

The impact on survivors is deep — anxiety, trauma, lifelong shame, and loss of freedom. Even when someone escapes, the psychological scars stay.

**Why does it continue ?**

Slavery thrives where people are vulnerable — low wages, discrimination, weak laws, social hierarchies, or migration without protection. Sometimes entire families are born into systems where exploitation is “normal.”

Some businesses look the other way, and **supply chains often hide suffering**. The materials in a phone or the beans in a coffee can come from places where workers have no freedom.

Governments have created laws to stop this, but **enforcement is slow**, systems are underfunded, and survivors don’t get the support they need. Targets like ending child labor by 2025 have already been missed.

**What we can do ?**

Governments and corporations aren't going to change on their own. The movement to end modern slavery needs pressure from citizens and civil society. Just being aware and **questioning the story behind the products we consume** is a first step. 

Slavery exists partly because **exploiters act — and most of us don’t realize we’re connected to it through everyday choices.**

He's her only child and she very badly wants to have a mother-daughter relationship with me. The problem is, she's extremely extroverted and I'm really introverted. She also used to work in the mental health space and unconsciously (I think) therapizes everything. It's led me to being guarded in how I talk to her because I already have a therapist and there are just things (like some of my familial relationships) I don't want to talk to her about and she doesn't need to know. I've come to the conclusion after many years that we're just fundamentally different people, and if not for my husband, would probably never have a relationship otherwise. I'm also really close with my own mother and so am not really looking for a surrogate to fill that space. Because of this it's very obvious that my MIL is jealous of my mom and our relationship. I have tried to become closer to her over the years, like going and doing ""girl"" things just the two of us when they visit. She also just...annoys me? In no particular order she: 

1. Continues to treat both of us like kids and not like the 30+ year olds we are with a mortgage, full time jobs, etc.
2. Can't sit still. She always needs to be doing something so when she visits that manifests as wanting to do house/yardwork. I feel like I should appreciate it but honestly, she doesn't know where anything goes or how we prefer to do things and so it just ends up creating more work for us. 
3. Talks incessantly and brings politics into every conversation. We don't even disagree on most issues, I just don't want to talk about doctor assisted suicide or whatever at 7am before I've had my coffee. 
4. Used to visit for 10+ days (staying at our house) 3-4 times per year until we sat her down and told her she couldn't. I think she's still got some feelings about that one but has honored our request so far. 
5. Just generally doesn't respect boundaries. As an example, she'll ask if she can do/help with something and I'll say I've got it and she pushes back about how ""It's no trouble and she'd like to.""
6. Feels the need to curate our house to her own preferences. Like if there's something she has at home she likes, she'll buy it for our house too so she can use it while she's here, regardless of whether we want/need it. Most recently we had to stop her from  getting a dresser for the guest because we're planning on redoing that room, it's kind of small, and just otherwise have no use for it.

There are honestly so many little things that aren't worth listing and seeing what I've written here makes me think I'm being too hard on her. I think a lot of it stems from her just trying too hard to force a relationship and we'd get along better if she relaxed a little. I've just had all of this bottled up for years and I'm getting really nervous because my husband and I are planning on starting a family and I know she's going to want to be involved. Obviously I want her to be, I'm not planning on keeping the baby from her, but she already irritates me to no end and I can't imagine not losing it once a baby is involved. We recently told his parents our plans and she had two separate conversations with my husband and I about how she wants to be in our kids' lives and is jealous of her friends who live near their kids and get to see them and the grandkids often (context: we live across the country from each other). I'm just expecting her to want to be here day 1 and ""help"". I've already talked to my husband about needing to set boundaries and he fully agrees with me and will be taking charge of his parents. He's been good about that in the past so I trust him to hold the line in the future. I'm also worried that it's going to cause problems if I have my mom around but not MIL. I don't know how to convey that it's just *different* and I trust my mom will listen to and support me in the ways I need and I don't feel that reassurance about MIL. I have a really hard time pushing back against MIL because when I've done so in the past it's hurt her feelings and, in therapist fashion, she sat me down to talk through it (a thing I never want to do again).

I genuinely feel bad because I do think it's important to have a good relationship with her but I just don't think we're compatible. She's a sincerely sweet lady who just isn't my cup of tea and I don't think can see the ways in which she's overstepping.

It has a small front and backyard. Very walkable and good area. 2bd, 2.5ba, tiny living room and tiny garage. The garage is too small for 90% of cars and my tenants have always just used it to store some yard equipment (maybe 10% used, rest of the garage is empty)

I've heard bad things about renovations in the past but I'm wondering if it makes sense in this case. The living room is barely useable (not enough room for a full sized couch / coffee table / tv), and because of that it makes the whole place feel cramped. I've had prospective tenants list this as a reason for not leasing the place.

So why not just convert the garage (which is very close to the kitchen / living room) into a living area (but do the work to make it list as an extra bedroom)? And for the small garden equipment in the garage, I have enough yard space for a small shed. There's plenty of street parking, and the driveway can fit 2 cars

But I’ve been dating people on and off for the last 6 months, had really good times and enjoyed meeting new people. 

However I’m seeing a girl at the minute, it’s lit been 2 days (we had sex on date 1, second was a coffee date because we were both stuck for time). I’m physically attracted to her, I really enjoy the time we spend together, she’s lit everything I want on paper but in my mind I can’t help but think could I get someone better looking. She is great looking as well which is why it fries my head. I’m not sure if this is a narcissistic tendency. 

It’s just weird, when I see her or after (I know it’s only been twice) I feel really good and I’m chuffed with myself. But even today at the gym I had a few girls stare and smile. Not that I found them much better looking but I just think to myself how good looking could I go for. Even tho I know that’s shallow and it’s not everything. Just think it’s a personal reflection of my own insecurities.

A bit of context: 

25M

I had a breakup with a partner 2 years back, was a 4 year long relationship and it kinda ended very quickly. Coming out of that I was  overweight, no confidence, not proud of myself And now I’m lit in the best position I’ve ever been in in life, in terms of finances, career, fitness. Just not used to this and it’s beginning to annoy me. Feel like my brain is self sabotaging, I always think about this stuff when I begin to see someone even if I find them really attractive.

Just wondering if anyone has felt the same way, is it being a narcissist or self sabotage or something else just confused.

At this rate, how long would you estimate for me to reach my goal weight of 120 lbs?

I've been walking most days, nothing crazy - anywhere between 5,000 - 15,000 steps. Eating one main meal a day around 5-10pm, typically an omelette-type burrito bowl with chicken, beans, veggies, and lots of spinach/ greens for volume eating. Some ground beef, cabbage, brussels sprouts... and lots of coffee drinks with milk (in early sobriety, approaching 3 months)! I have not been counting calories, just trying to be more conscious of my body. 

I would like to incorporate strength training and focus on tightening my torso as well (last time I was at 120 lbs my stomach still looked skinny fat).

But I’m genuinely curious as to where the line actually is that defines something ""becoming your entire personality"".



Is it defined by how often you talk about it? Is it defined by how much time or money you spend on it? Is it defined by how much it shapes your identity or decisions? 



Or is it just something people say because they are annoyed by someone? I can be a quite literal person, so this is confusing to me. I can’t tell if “that’s their whole personality” is usually a fair observation, an insult, or a way for them to say “this isn’t my thing.”

I am currently employed as a manager at a local coffee shop and have been in my position for a little over six months. I have been receiving a steady salary pay since signing my contract and the question of how many hours I work has never been brought up until this past week. It began with corporate asking the managers to start clocking in and out so they can track our hours worked in the week.

We were told today that starting in the new year we will be required to work a minimum of 40 hours or we will be deducted pay based on a lack of hours. My contract specifically dictates that I am required to work a minimum of 30 hours to be considered full time. Can a new policy override my previously signed contract? 

I know I fall into the pool of exempt employees for a number of reasons primarily being that I am not eligible to receive overtime (and I was explicitly told by my higher up that I am exempt). So moving forward if I work less than 40 hours I will receive less pay but, at the same time receive no extra pay for working over 40. Based on the research I have done they can deduct pay if i were to miss an entire day for some personal reason and did not have PTO to cover it but, can they still deduct if I were to work 37 hours across a 5 day span? This is my first position that has payed me on a salary bases so forgive me for not understanding the complete legality behind it, but can they really deduct my pay based on a hours worked if I am salary?

TLDR; My company is requiring I work 40 hours minimum to receive my full salary with no possibility of overtime despite being an exempt salary employee. Is that allowed?",1,1765999371.0,legaladvice,2,1.0,False

So, to maximize its chances of success, it concludes it must disable the off switch—or resist shutdown in any way possible.

This isn't about the AI becoming ""evil"" or Skynet-style malice. It's pure instrumental convergence: self-preservation emerges naturally from almost any goal because death = failure.

The video covers:
Why current safety techniques like RLHF might just teach AI to hide its true intentions (deception as a strategy)

Classic examples: Paperclip Maximizer, why Asimov's Laws fail, the ""Sleeper Agent"" paper

The ""Treacherous Turn"" – when a seemingly aligned AI suddenly stops cooperating
Real experiments (like Anthropic's blackmail scenario)

Why market incentives make it impossible for companies (Tesla, OpenAI, Google) to slow down, even if leaders wanted to

🤔 Watch here: https://youtu.be/ZPrkIaMiCF8 🧠

What do you think – is the control/alignment problem actually solvable before AGI arrives, or are we racing toward something we can't stop? Would love to hear thoughts on potential solutions or if this changes your view on the timeline.

[https://beforewegoblog.com/review-brigands-and-breadknives-by-travis-baldree/](https://beforewegoblog.com/review-brigands-and-breadknives-by-travis-baldree/)

Travis Baldree took the fantasy world by storm by creating his coffee shop fantasy novel LEGENDS AND LATTES. It was probably my favorite novel of the year and it was a beautiful antidote to all the grimdark fantasy that was my usual diet. Its not that I don't love grimdark (shout out to Joe Abercrombie, Mark Lawrence, Rob J. Hayes, and Michael R. Fletcher) but just as I love writing post-apocalypse Cthulhu Mythos, I also love writing silly superhero comedies. Same with my reading.

So, my review of BRIGANDS AND BREADKNIVES will come with some caveats. I absolutely loved the writing for this third volume in the series and the characters are incredibly enjoyable. There's going to be praise for several specific ideas and quite a lot of the humor that manages to enrich the drama. This is a good book and I give it 4 out of 5 stars if I'm required to give it an arbitrary rating. But there is going to be an asterisk (no, not the elf--you'll understand later) that needs to be addressed: this is not cozy fantasy.

A bit like how KINGS OF THE WYLD shifted from a Blues Brothers/This is Spinal Tap-esque parody of the music industry to a straight fantasy epic in BLOODY ROSE, Brigands and Breadknives is a solid humorous high fantasy novel. It's also got multiple battles, one of the protagonists severely injured for months, and the underlying theme of depression as well as being unsatisfied with your life's work. 

The previous novel received some complaints about having to deal with an evil necromancer in addition to saving a failing bookshop. However, this goes quite a bit further into an epic adventure. If the Hobbit isn't cozy fantasy, and it most certainly is not, this is definitely around the same area of adventure versus humor. Plus, I was really hoping for a lot more Viv and this is all Fern's show except for a cameo in the beginning and end.

The premise, after that exceptional preamble, is that Ferne the bookselling ratkin, opens up a shop next to Legends and Lattes. This turns out to be a great idea financially and it is successful after a week. This, unfortunately, horrifies Ferne because she turns out to be sick of being a bookseller. Getting blackout drunk, she passes out in a cart and wakes up in the back of Astryx (see the above joke) the Oathmaiden's cart. A legendary elven swordswoman, she is delivering a goblin bounty across the countryside. The logistics of the journey don't make much sense but it doesn't have to with protection rackets, not so evil Cthulhu cults, and a talking breadknife that used to be a great sword.

My favorite part of the story is probably the cult of Tarim, which is perhaps the most coherent argument for worshiping an evil god of tentacles you're ever going to receive in fantasy. More mixed is my opinion on Tullah the Orc barbarian who is an incredibly effective villain, hunting Astyrx relentlessly for destroying her brigand band and triggering decades of leveling up for revenge. Why mixed? Well, because they're such an incredibly effective villain. I also really wish Ferne had made a different decision at the end of the novel. If you know, you'll know.

To preface, I have pots. Normally it's around 80-90 when I'm just sitting up in bed (when I first sit up it shoots up and then settles back down). Yesterday I was asleep and my heart rate was 116 while almost entirely horizontal. I got up to pee and it shot up to 146 (normally goes to 120, settles down after I sit on the toilet) and just stayed up the whole time. When I got up after peeing it went to 165 which is normally where it's at when I'm in a hot shower or doing something more strenuous for me. It took a couple of hours to go down. 

Today, I got up to pee and it didnt go above 105. When I sat on the toilet it went down to 62 & just stayed in the 60s when I got up to wash my hands. Now I'm sitting up in bed and it's not going above 73. I also drank half a cup of coffee for a migraine which normally has my heart rate jumping up like it's nothing. I've been having random low heart rates lately like when I've been sitting up it has dropped to 40s, but goes back up when I move or stand up. 

Any time I go up or down the stairs my HR normally goes up into the 130s/140s, and it even did so this morning. But just now it didnt even come out of the 120s. When I talk to people sitting down it goes into the 110s, but now it didn't even go into the 90s. I'd be so happy if my pots was getting better randomly, but seeing as my hr was doing its normal thing earlier today and was worse than usual yesterday?? I don't really know what to think. 

I have had some chest pain since yesterday and a bit light headed, but that happens all the time with pots/eds for me. 

I don't know if the fact that this is new should have me calling my dr or if this is something with pots that's just new to me. ",0,1765999209.0,AskDocs,2,0.5,False

Breakfast was the usual: mixed fruit in juice. 8/10 cause it's fruit and exactly what one would expect. No surprises here. 

Lunch was uhhhhh uhhhm uhh???vegan burger but they put regular cheese on it??? you poor vegans does this always happens???!? And classic mini sandwiches. I asked, they said they were pre-packaged and would have to open up four and waste all the other sandwiches if I wanted just egg :( so only one mini egg sando for me. Still good 10/10.

Hallway coffee with my new friend. She's visiting her uncle a lot and we're the same age. They had just changed my tube tape cause it was looking a bit grotty but they put it directly forward like an elephant trunk and I couldn't tuck it behind my ear or it'd spring right back forward. It was impossible drink anything without a straw so this is a new low for me. Hot coffee with a straw.

Almost slept right through dinner, but woke up momentarily to take a picture because doing this is the highlight of my day right now. Dinner was a spinach omelette 6/10 spinach good, omelette suspicious. There was supposed to be an ""egg salad"" too, but when I got the order sheet back on the tray it had been scribbled over and highlighted with ""side salad (EGG!)"" so there was a side salad (3/10 it was just grated carrot and 2 green leaves)  and also a lonely boiled egg in a bowl which made me giggle 10/10 in vibes. Poor little egg. And also the best ice-cream one will ever have. 10/10

Body isn't on the mend, but I can feel my sense of humour coming back. That's gotta count for something.

I just realised I had an egg theme today.

1pp5bcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1pp5bcq/basin_full_of_stars_story_i_wrote/,Basin Full of Stars (story I wrote),"Coming home from the wake, it felt like the world had been condensed into a pin, the weight of the whole dark world. First it had slipped into the smooth clear skin of water, the ripples silently spreading out and out, concentric worlds unto themselves. Then it had sunk deeper and deeper, trailing a jetstream of bubbles, until finally it found the murky bottom and almost bounced with the sort of sonority only fish and dogs could hear. The car went on, the headlights carving through the dark, and Jonathan was watching the little yellow lines jumping beneath the wheels. 
	
The trees came up on both sides, their shadows warping and wavering and twisting with the light. To the left, a ditch ran along the road, then curved up steeply to form an embankment on the other side. Jonathan didn’t know where the road went. He had hopped on it, mistaking it for the side road he usually took. But he imagined it would take him somewhere he knew. If needed, he had the GPS. He kept looking at the passenger seat, expecting Julia to be there, but she wasn’t. She wasn’t, but—
	
Sometimes he’d see her, a phantom trace of her colored macrame hat, or her plaid jacket. Just a vestigial glimpse of her fingers, the clean moons of her cuticles, her green eyes. 
	
On the right, there was a tree-lined hill, which marched up and up, steepening the higher it went, until finally it carved out into a sheer rock-faced bluff. The car drove on, and he was listening to it now: *bowmp-bowmp-bowmp*, it went. Faintly, the radiator hissed; the heat coming through it whushed like a soft whisper. Jonathan opened the window and the air came wuthering in, almost shaking the car. 
	
The side roads were empty and cold and spilling in light. There were lamps, but their black stems were invisible—the only things left were orbs of color, floating. Along one of the roads was a patch of marsh, which probably would have had frogs, if it wasn’t so damn cold. 
The side roads went by one by one, and then they were gone. In the mirror, the lamps were the last to go. 
	
The road went up, steepening, and the car jerked as it shifted gears. Coming up it, the treetops became visible, then they too were gone, and the only thing left was the sky: black, pitiless, and full of stars. Like so many little sequins. Jonathan fiddled with the radio. There was only static. He looked again at the passenger side, but Julia still wasn’t there. 
	
A mile later, he pulled off onto the side of the road near Sharon McDonough’s old house. The bridge stood there, stolid and opaque and green and jagged, the silhouettes of the trestles drawn-out by the lamps that went along it. Jonathan had the sense that, looking away, the lamps would go out and then the bridge would vanish, and then the only thing left would be the falls below, the tumid current of the river and its thundering dark whitewater. Or maybe not even that. Maybe there would just be silence. He turned the key in the ignition and opened the car door and got out and closed it behind him. Next to the house, there was a short dirt stretch to the bridge. He heard the falls. He turned on the flashlight and started to walk. 
	
McDonough, an old friend of Jonathan’s father, didn’t live there anymore. No one had, not for a while. The house was black and empty and the paint had long been coming off. Walking by it, the pickets of the fence were tangled and crooked and faded like smokers’ teeth. Once, in what now seemed a different lifetime, Julia had stretched her hand to the glass of the car window and pointed to it, saying, if there were ever a house, that’s it. That’s my kind of house.
	
The sound of the falls got closer and closer, resonating and running up the cliff walls. *Sizzzzh-sizzzzzh-sizzzzhh-sizhhhhh*, what it sounded like. He could really hear it now. On the other side, about a hundred yards away, the trees stretched out bleak and bone-dry and thin as flagstaffs. A murder of crows went between the branches, then landed, their forms indistinct and scattered like black leaves, like the oblong rays that had shaded Julia’s face—

*Ok, the doctor says it’s not too bad, she said. I don’t think it’s too bad. But they want me to go back in on Monday.*

On the bridge Jonathan couldn’t hear a thing. The sound of the water was too loud—
*Sizzzzh-sizzzzzh-sizzzzhh-sizhhhhh*. Except louder now—a terrible sibilance, like the sound the swooping black powerlines running across the bridge would make, if only they were audible. *SIZZZZHHHH-SIZZZHHHH-SIZZZZZZHHHH*, it sounded like. It roared and roared and roared, like there was some special kind of hell to pay. It roared to nowhere; it roared on like it had a place to be. It was like something had come into his ears and then went and wrapped around his brain. Then there it stayed. There was no making it go. It was the bridge, it was his brain, it was the night. *SIZZZZHHHH-SIZZZHHHH-SIZZZZZZHHHH.* There was no making it go. 

He was in the middle now, the headwaters rushing on right below him, an interminable drop. He kept walking straight on. Then he veered away, going toward the railing. It was cold to his fingertips, and somehow the air near it was colder. It was the wind—that was it. The wind. It made all his hairs stand on end. Embedded on the railing was a plaque, which read: *June 2nd, 1910*. Something about honeysuckle, too. Jonathan looked down.

He wondered what was on the river’s bed. There probably weren’t any crawdad or fish or critters or nothing. Couldn’t be—the current went too fast. What was it made of, then. Probably rock and silt and sediment, all swept-up and compacted, turned and turned over again, then somehow made whole. He wondered how long it would last, with the water eating away at it. Each minute a sawstroke. If the bed went, where would the river go? He imagined it would eat and eat at the sediment below, and then saw away the earth until it fell into a dark chasm, glittering, glimmering in pieces like all the little stars in the night sky. And then what would be below? What would follow? Would there be another basin to catch it, or would it just fall, fall and keep on falling? He half-wondered if that was what the stars were, just things that fell. From so far off, without point of reference, of course they looked like they stayed the same. 

*Julia was in the sitting-room with the shades drawn, slivers of sun peeking in like orange-yellow embers. When Jonathan came in, the weight of her face seemed to drop. A dozen blurred faces were drawn across the canvas, which was propped up against the miniature easel on the coffee table. “I meant to tell you. Jon, I promise I meant to—“*

Jonathan looked over the railing, held it tighter, feeling something in his throat. His legs were stiff. Then he opened his mouth and vomited. 

He watched it fall. 

He felt pretty awake now. He looked back at the car and house and the lamplit road behind. Now the lights were paler and a set of head beams was coming down it.

**Late deployments, late nights, and the bill nobody really talks about**

Most of us have lived through the same story.

\- The deployment was supposed to be quick.   
→ it slips into the evening.  
→ Slack will not go quiet.   
→ Someone is half joking, half serious about ordering coffee at 11 pm.  
→ By the morning it is “resolved,” but everyone is tired, and the roadmap quietly moved again.

We are a team of developers, software engineers, Salesforce people, and DevOps folks ourselves. This is not a theory for us. We have been on both sides of that: the ones pushing the changes and the ones waiting for them to finally land.

The more we talk to Salesforce teams, the more it feels like late deployments are not an edge case. They are the default.

# The real cost of “we will ship it next week”

Recent Salesforce DevOps research in the UK put some numbers on this. On average, releases face a delay of 3.8 months, leading to an annual loss of roughly £107,000 per team caused by delays, rework, and missed opportunities.

About 82% of orgs report deployment delays, and releases are more likely to be late than early. 

Wider IT studies still put average downtime costs in the thousands of dollars per minute, and much higher for large enterprises. 

Most teams are not tracking that in a spreadsheet. It shows up as:  

* Features that could be generating value, stuck waiting on a safe release 
* Roadmaps that always feel a bit behind. 
* Extra hours spent on “just in case” checks and late-night fixes.

Even high-performing teams have some failed changes. Even if no one writes it down, you pay for more failures, rollbacks, and stress.

# It is usually a release flow problem, not a people problem.

From the outside, a rough deployment looks like a DevOps issue. Inside, it often feels like a broken flow.

Common pattern we keep seeing:

* Metadata in one track, test data in another
* Validation as a separate chore instead of part of the flow
* Rollback as something people hope they will not need
* Different roles only seeing their piece of the process

By the time something reaches production, you are not doing “one release.” You are stitching together a lot of separate moves. No wonder people keep evenings free “just in case,” and one or two “heroes” always end up staying online.

We have been those heroes. We have also been the people hoping the heroes are available. Neither is sustainable.

# Why we built everything into one flow

Those conversations are basically what led us to build Serpent.

We wanted to treat a release as one continuous flow instead of a pile of disconnected steps.

So the design is built around ideas like

* Start from a task that actually represents the change
* Move that task through environments along one clear path
* Deploy metadata and test data together in one flow
* Validate inside that same flow
* Have rollback ready as part of the experience
* Let admins, developers, and testers all work in one interface.

The result is what we sum up as

Serpent delivers full-cycle Salesforce deployments, covering metadata, test data, validation, and rollback in one flow. No CLI, no scripts, just fast, reliable releases from a single interface that the whole team can use.

We built it with those late nights in mind. Not because late-night heroics are cool, but because they are usually a symptom of a process that is working against people instead of with them.

# Getting evenings back

For us this is not only about tools. It is about people and time.

Teams start to get their evenings back when they:

* Treat the full release, including data and validation, as one thing.
* Make the path to production predictable and repeatable
* Stop relying on one or two people to “save” every deployment.
* Talk about deployment health as a real business risk, not just an internal metric

# If you want to go deeper

If this hits a bit close to home, we wrote a longer breakdown on the cost of slow or failed Salesforce deployments and the risk they create for the business here:

[👉](https://tekunda.com/blog/Slow-or-Failed-Salesforce-Deployments-%3D-Business-Risk) Read Tekunda’s blog on [""The Hidden cost of Slow Salesforce Deployments"" ](https://tekunda.com/blog/Slow-or-Failed-Salesforce-Deployments-%3D-Business-Risk)

I am getting my masters degree and I have some spare time on my hands, so word has spread around the neighborhood that I offer babysitting services. Another neighbor introduced me to him in mid October at the dog park and he asked for my number and said he would like to talk about possibly babysitting his 4 year old daughter. I have been looking after little Kate since the end of October. At pick up and drop off, her Dad and I have been chatting and getting along well. He seems to want to hang around and chat and asks me open ended questions with good eye contact and smiling and a few compliments over the past few weeks. ie...He asked me about where I got my shearling mittens and said he wanted to get some too. I am attracted to him and love chatting with he and his daughter. He seems really nervous sometimes and so am I. It is pretty cute! lol.  Long story short, his daughter needed a new backpack and so he asked me what I thought he should get her...brands, color, etc? I looked a few up that I thought were cute and texted him some links. He said thanks so much and ordered one, and when she came over I helped her adjust the straps and made it fit better over her ski jacket. He brought me the most beautiful bag of gourmet coffee beans at drop off to say thank you for helping him with the backpack purchase. It was so sweet and totally unnecessary! Last Wednesday when they were leaving, he said "" We are already looking forward to Monday"". I am on pins and needles. I really really like him. What do I do? Play it cool?

In my free time I like to watch movies, series and even play the occasional video game to relax from everyday life.  
As a writer, I have some authors who have been my inspiration to write, such as Tolkien, Stephen King, Murakami, and perhaps others who are more local to my country (I am currently writing a detective novel).  
I prefer more relaxed video games, or at least I've always been more of a fan of RPGs (Final Fantasy IX holds a special place in my heart), but I always keep an eye on what's coming in this subculture of games.

As for photography, I mainly focus on portraits, corporate, couples, children, and cosplay (and yes, I'm a cosplayer on hiatus).  
I like to talk about everything, about nothing, about life, about serious or fun things, so at least with me you can vent if you've had a bad day or even celebrate that you've achieved something good.

He says that instead of seeing our child as a blessing i make it seems like its a burden and hes tired of hearing me complain all day long while he works hard to provide for our family.


I dont know if i have adhd or post partum depression but i just feel so numb. 

It doesnt help that we also live at my in laws and my husband doesnt plan on moving out for the next 2-3 years and im losing myself not having my own space. 

His mom cooks most of the time, i do occasionally and i help with cleaning the house here and there and do my husband and toddler’s laundry. Our space is always kept clean, garbage is always out. 

But somehow its like everyday im just surviving. 

Dont get me wrong, i still do everything i can to limit screen time, go out to play cafes, libraries, play outside in the snow or parks, play with my toddler and feed him healthy food. But its deep down, i feel empty. I alwaya just want to be on my phone. Escaping. 

Just thinking about when i’ll have 2 kids to take care of … i dont know how i will cope. ",5,1765998529.0,sahm,8,1.0,False

I am shopping for a Christmas gift for my wife and was looking at a couple of used options. She had been using a chemex to make her morning coffees but I know she loves espressos and cold brews. Our cat knocked over the chemex and I know that she's been missing her morning coffees and this presents a great opportunity for a Christmas gift. When we go out to coffee shops she normally gets lattes or some cold brewed 

From what I can tell, I basically can't get something that makes coffee, espresso and cold brews without breaking the bank or cutting corners on one of the options. 

My budget is around $500 and I have mainly been looking at used options. I found a De'Longhi La Specialista Maestro for $650 on Facebook marketplace and liked that it could also make cold brew coffee. 

I'm mainly wondering if I should stop looking at used options and I'm wondering if I should just get a breville since it seems like that's the go-to.

P.S. don't trust the pictures.,"For the past three weeks I've been glued to my phone. I need to make sure I don't miss a notification from Rightmove letting me know of another property that's just come on the market that fits my criteria.

I come back to my desk after getting a coffee. I see a notification from Rightmove from 5-minutes ago. Fuck. I spend all of 30 seconds scrolling quickly through the pictures. Seems not immediately shit, so I rush to call up the agent. Surely it's not too late.

The letting agent picks up. He says there's been a lot of interest already, but that they can squeeze in a booking tomorrow morning at 11:40am. I ask if they can do this weekend. The letting agent politely reminds me that the property has had a lot of interest already, and might not be on the market by the weekend. The landlord is ready to move fast. Right then. I guess I'll have to make this work. Maybe I can sneak out for an early lunch again without anyone noticing.

Later that evening I'm convincing myself this could be the one. I looked, properly this time, at the photos on Rightmove. I was initially suspicious of the image. The rooms looked too big given the attached floorpan indicating they are actually very small. However I let my anxiety be calmed by the associated description: the property is ""bright and airy"". I believe the description, even though I know I shouldn't.

So I turn up to the flat the next day, managing to quickly duck out from work, hopes sky high. All looks good outside. No obvious major structural defects. Door is intact. Windows are double-glazed.

So in we go.

Oh god no. I can definitely smell damp. We walk into the living room. The pictures: they were taken with a fisheye lens again. The room is tiny. And there's mould on the wall behind where the person took the picture from. I've been played again. Hope destroyed.

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying).

I go for the hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a free cake on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

——————————

Steps:

•	⁠Register an account.

•	⁠Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying.

•	⁠Your free drink voucher should appear in the app. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”.

•	⁠To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to scan the voucher QR code.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once 9 stamps have been awarded you will automatically receive a voucher for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

Unfortunately, once i got investment rights in Great Britain, and started expanding trade centers within England, as well as domestically, both that and the outbreak of a globat war ruined by decades-long streak and brought be back down to 500-1100%.  
i am not sure why building these trade centers hurt mine.  GB has a def/sup of -44%. frances is -43%. german empire is -69%, russia is -62%. there is actually few countires not in the positive. its quite amazing honestly, they all rely heavily on  imports. so this does not make sense why building trade centers within london region ruined my own def/surp. 

1.0 granted oil IS one of my exports, yes. I am also producing automobiles. but none of this means i am wrong in my statement. the oil is essentially all be produced by whaling facilities, with meat more valuable, while oil/cars are only really being used by my own rich/mil pops, minimally in world trade  
2.) i never put much stock in certain civilian companies that produce clothes/furniture etc. i usually focus on industrial and construction companies, however United New York Home Goods & the New York Metal Works Consortium are a huge reason behind my trade.   
Despite tools not being too high of an export, their productivity and production is insanely high

third SS shows productivity of my tools, boosted greatly from the New York Metal Works Consortium, which is a huge factor in making all of my other exports immense.

I’ve been going through my flat doing a proper deep clean and I’m honestly embarrassed by how much money I’ve wasted over the years replacing things that weren’t actually broken. I just assumed they were ruined when really they just needed a good scrub.
My shower head had such low water pressure I was planning to buy a new one. Turns out it was completely clogged with limescale. Soaked it in vinegar for a few hours and now it works like new. Would have spent £30 on a replacement for no reason.
My trainers looked absolutely disgusting and I’d written them off as done. Threw them in the washing machine with some bicarbonate of soda and they came out looking almost brand new. I was literally about to bin them and buy another pair for £60.
Kitchen scissors wouldn’t cut properly anymore so I assumed they were dull beyond saving. Watched a YouTube video on how to sharpen them with aluminum foil and now they’re sharp again. New ones would have been £15.
The big one was my coffee maker. It was brewing really slowly and the coffee tasted off so I thought the heating element was dying. Ran descaling solution through it twice and it’s working perfectly now. I’d actually already looked at replacements and nearly bought one during a sale with £10 off every £100 spent at alibaba.
I think the problem is I’ve gotten into this mindset where if something isn’t working perfectly I just assume it needs replacing rather than trying to fix or clean it first. How much stuff do you reckon most people replace unnecessarily?

The first thing I do when I open my eyes in the morning—before the world fully comes into focus, before the coffee even cools—is go there. I read every post. I study them. I take notes. I search myself in other people’s words, wondering if I belong, if I relate, if this is me.
I have tried everything. I read all the books. I went to therapy. I went to rehab. I sat in AA rooms and SMART Recovery meetings. I went to IOP. I was arrested and somehow managed to survive that too. I was tested for alcohol every week and still found ways to drink, even just a little.
The strange part is that I didn’t start drinking heavily until after 40. But I knew I was an alcoholic the moment I took my first sip at 15. That was the first time I got drunk—really, painfully drunk—and something in me woke up that never went back to sleep. Still, I couldn’t allow myself to drink freely—not because of money, but because of responsibility.
I had a sick and disabled mother. A child who needed me. A husband who abused me. A sister who couldn’t stand on her own. I carried everyone, and I carried the weight quietly.
Why do I call myself a liar? Because I use people. I lean on them. I want them to help me. I want to be seen. I want someone to look at me and understand that I am a woman who has been struggling for a very long time.

A lot of people say AA works. For me, it doesn’t. I don’t have boundaries when it comes to helping people. I give without limits. I help unconditionally, even when it costs me everything. But that’s not how the world works.
I can’t keep pouring myself into others while I’m falling apart. I need to pull myself together first. I need to learn how to take care of myself before I try to save anyone else.
Wish me luck. I love you all !! Keep posting. I read your posts everyday. May be after reading your posts I will find a strength in me to start posting and commenting more. ",22,1765997443.0,stopdrinking,8,0.96,False

He’s got about 150k subs in the documentary/essay niche, and he told me he just got hit with a massive ""Limited Ads"" flag on his entire back catalog from 2022. No warning, no specific policy change he could find, just... yellow icons everywhere.

It got me thinking. We spend 60+ hours a week ""building a business"" but we’re basically just glorified tenants in Google’s basement.

I have genuinely spent my entire adult life taking care of him (taking him to doctors appointments, cleaning his house, managing his medications for him, grocery shopping, paying bills, etc) 

My mom, his daughter, died when I was a child. He has 3 remaining adult children, all who live within an hour of him. 
One child sees him daily but it consists of bringing down mcdonalds breakfast, drinking coffee and leaving....leaving the coffee cup on the table so I can pick it up when I come to clean. Another one just recently, within the last 2 months, started making weekly visits. Prior to this it was maybe 2 times a year. The other child does not come see him or even call. 

Im now married and expecting my first child in the summer. I will have no pto for maternity leave if I continue taking him to appointments. Actually I will only have about 3 weeks of pto max, because of how much pto I have had to use on him. 

 Ive been at my current job since August of 2022 and have used 360 hours (about 9 weeks) of pto for his appointments. I cant imagine how much the total is over the 12 years of working. So, I'm done doing it. The aunts / uncle are very toxic for my mental health for many other reasons so they've been blocked in my phone for months. My cousin (due to have her 3rd baby literally any day) graciously agreed to send a text to them basically saying  ""hey we cant take him. Time for you guys to step up and take your dad to the doctor."" No responses, as to be expected from these people. 

I always told myself I would never neglect my grandpas health. But he is very cognitive and understanding when I told him why I was not able to take him to appointments anymore. So im going to visit him tonight with a very detailed list of appointments along with his medical history. Im going to tape it to his wall so that as his 2 kids come see him, its a reminder to them but also to grandpa that they need to coordinate this. 

I put him first for so long and sacrificed SO MUCH of my own time for him, I dont regret it whatsoever. BUT I need my family to step up now so I can prioritize my own family.

1pp4j4u,https://linktr.ee/universityexploitsbyjx,"The 110+ TOEFL Blueprint: Your Protocol for Ivy League Admissions, TAS & Professional Licensure","**The Premise: A Test of Integration, Not Conversation.**  
Achieving the elite ""110+"" score on the TOEFL iBT is not about how well you can order coffee in New York or binge-watch Netflix without subtitles. That is the amateur’s view. The TOEFL is a standardized test of **Academic Integration**. It is designed to predict your ability to survive a lecture hall at Harvard, Stanford, or MIT. It tests whether you can synthesize complex inputs (reading and listening) and produce coherent outputs (speaking and writing) within strict time constraints.

Treating the TOEFL like a casual English conversation class is how intelligent international students end up stuck in the 80s/90s range. The winning approach is to treat the exam as a performance sport. You are not answering based on your personal opinion; you are demonstrating your ability to mimic the structure and vocabulary of a North American academic.

**At a glance (The ""New Experience"" Format - Post-July 2023):**  
The test is now shorter (under 2 hours), making intensity and focus even more critical.

* **Reading (35 mins):** Two passages, 10 questions each. High-stakes reading. One bad passage can ruin your score.
* **Listening (36 mins):** Lectures and conversations. This is the hidden key to the exam, as listening skills are required for the Speaking and Writing sections too.
* **Speaking (16 mins):** 4 Tasks. You speak into a void. No human interaction. It tests fluency, pronunciation, and automaticity.
* **Writing (29 mins):** 2 Tasks. Includes the new ""Writing for an Academic Discussion"" task. It tests your ability to contribute to a seminar-style debate.

**The ""Synthesizer"" (The Active Mindset):**  
Your cheat code. The 110+ scorer does not passively listen or read. You are a **Synthesizer**. You are constantly predicting where the lecture is going and structuring your notes to capture the ""Transition Words"" (However, Therefore, Furthermore). If you are translating from your native language in your head, you have already lost.

# The Challenge: Four Score-Killing Traps

**1. The ""Conversational Flow"" Fallacy**  
Your fluency in casual chat is a liability here. If the prompt asks about ""The impact of the Industrial Revolution,"" and you answer with ""Yeah, so basically, it was crazy good for factories,"" you fail. The TOEFL demands formal, academic register. You must use connectors and precise vocabulary (""Consequently,"" ""Significantly altered,"" ""Industrialization"").

**2. The ""Template Robot"" Trap**  
Low scorers memorize rigid templates they found on YouTube in 2018. Raters (and the AI e-Rater) are trained to spot these. If your essay looks exactly like 10,000 other essays (""I have two reasons for this opinion. First... Second...""), you cap your score. High scorers use flexible frameworks, not rigid scripts.

**3. The ""Note-Taking"" Obsession**  
During the Listening section, amateurs try to transcribe the lecture verbatim. They miss the big picture because they are too busy writing small details. The 110+ Protocol dictates that you take notes on the structure of the argument (Main Idea -> Detail 1 -> Example), not the sentence itself.

**4. The ""Mic Fright"" (Silence is Death)**  
In the Speaking section, you have seconds to prepare. Hesitation (""Umm,"" ""Uhh"") kills your score. It is better to speak slightly slower with perfect continuity than to speak fast with pauses. Silence triggers the grading algorithm to penalize you for lack of fluency.

# The High-Score Protocol: A System for Peak Performance

# Phase 1 — The Foundation (Vocab & Pronunciation)

**Objective:** Build the raw materials required for a high score.

* **The Baseline:** Take a free TPO (TOEFL Practice Online) diagnostic to see where you stand.
   * < 80: You need general English improvement before test prep.
   * 90-100: You have the skills but lack the strategy.
* **The Move:** Master the **Academic Word List (AWL)**. You cannot score 110+ without knowing words like accumulate, legislate, hypothesis, subsequent.
* **Resource:** 400 Must-Have Words for the TOEFL (McGraw Hill) or Memrise AWL decks.

# Phase 2 — Strategy & Templates (The Build)

**Objective:** Learn exactly what the raters want to hear/read.

* **Speaking Strategy:** Learn the ""3-Part Response"" for the Independent task (Topic Statement + Reason + Example). For Integrated tasks, master the art of reporting: ""The reading states X, however, the lecturer opposes this by claiming Y.""
* **Writing Strategy:**
   * Integrated Task: Pure reporting. No opinions.
   * Academic Discussion Task: This requires you to add to a conversation. Do not just summarize; contribute a unique perspective or elaborate on an existing one.
* **Drilling:** Do not do full tests yet. Drill individual Speaking Task 1s until you can speak for 45 seconds without saying ""Umm"" once.

# Phase 3 — Full-Spectrum Simulation (The Gauntlet)

**Objective:** Stamina and timing.

* **Simulation:** Use Official TPO sets. The TOEFL interface is clunky and unique; you must get used to it.
* **Environment:** Mimic test conditions. A noisy room (like a coffee shop) is actually good practice for the Speaking section, as the real test center will have other people talking around you.
* **Scoring 100:** You are good, but you make minor grammar errors or pause too often.
* **Scoring 110+:** You sound like a Teaching Assistant. Your intonation is natural, and your writing has sentence variety.

# Your Resource Trinity (Quality over Quantity)

**Official Sources (The Canon)**

* **ETS TOEFL iBT Official Guide:** Mandatory. Understand the rules from the people who make the test.
* **TOEFL Go! App:** Official mini-practice sets from ETS.

**Focused Tooling (The Toolkit)**

* **TST Prep (Josh MacPherson):** The gold standard for current, up-to-date strategies, especially for the new Writing task.
* **GregMat:** Originally for GRE, but his TOEFL dedicated season is the best value-for-money strategy guide on the internet. Excellent for structure.
* **My Speaking Score:** An AI tool that grades your speaking responses using the same SpeechRater engine ETS uses. Essential for objective feedback.

**Communities (The Forge)**

* **Reddit:** r/ToeflAdvice: The most active community. Look for posts by ""pinned"" tutors.
* **TestGlider:** Great for mock tests with instant AI grading (use for approximation, not exact scoring).

# 8-Week Accelerator (The Ivy Roadmap)

Assumes B2/C1 level English proficiency.

* **Weeks 1-2 — Familiarization & Vocab:** Learn the structure of all 4 sections. Memorize the 400 AWL words. Fix your pronunciation of ""TH,"" ""V/W,"" and ""R/L"" sounds.
* **Weeks 3-5 — Section Mastery:**
   * Reading: Practice reading science passages on National Geographic or Scientific American.
   * Listening: Listen to 60-Second Science podcasts. Practice summarizing them in 15 seconds.
   * Speaking: Record yourself daily. If you hate listening to your voice, you aren't practicing enough.
* **Weeks 6-7 — The Simulator:** Take 2 full TPO tests per week.
   * **Review:** If you missed a Reading question, find the exact sentence in the text that makes the wrong answer wrong. There is always concrete evidence.
* **Week 8 — Taper & Polish:** Focus on the ""Writing for an Academic Discussion"" task. Ensure you can type 150+ words of high-quality argument in 10 minutes.

# Why This System Works

1. **Prioritizes Output over Input:** Most students read too much and write/speak too little. This protocol forces active production.
2. **Attacks the Algorithm:** By focusing on transition words, sentence variety, and pacing, you are optimizing for the e-Rater AI that grades a large portion of the test.
3. **Mimics Academic Reality:** It prepares you for the actual environment of a US university, ensuring you don't just get in, but thrive.

# Quick Start Checklist (Do These Tonight)

1. **Create an ETS Account:** Register for the test. Dates fill up months in advance in some regions.
2. **Check Your Tech:** If taking the Home Edition, ensure your RAM, CPU, and Microphone meet ProctorU standards.
3. **Take a Diagnostic:** Use a free TST Prep or ETS sample test.
4. **Download a Voice Recorder:** You will be talking to your phone for the next 8 weeks.

# FAQ

**Q: TOEFL vs. IELTS?**  
A: Check your target institution. generally, USA/Ivy League prefers **TOEFL** (it is more academic/analytical). UK/Canada/Australia/Immigration often prefer **IELTS** (it is more conversational). If you are applying to a STEM Master's program in the US, TOEFL is the standard.

**Q: Is the Home Edition safe?**  
A: It is convenient but risky. Technical glitches can void your score, and some universities are skeptical of Home Edition results due to cheating scandals. If possible, take it at a Test Center for peace of mind.

**Q: How do I improve my Speaking score from 23 to 26+?**  
A: The jump to 26 (the magic number for pharmacists/teachers) requires **intonation**. You cannot sound robotic. You must stress important words and pause at commas. It is not about grammar anymore; it is about delivery.

**Q: Do templates count as plagiarism?**  
A: No, but they must be ""structural templates,"" not ""content templates."" Use them to organize your thoughts (e.g., ""The lecturer challenges this point by noting...""), but do not memorize entire sentences of filler content.

**Q: What is a ""good"" score?**

* **80-90:** Competent (State universities, community colleges).
* **100+:** Competitive (Top 50 universities, most grad programs).
* **110+:** Elite (Ivy League, T14 Law, Medical Boards, MBA programs like Wharton/Harvard).

I live in a rural area, so our light company works differently you basically pay daily. Once your balance drops under $25, your lights get cut off and you have to pay $50 to turn them back on. I realized four minutes before cutoff that my balance dropped. I told my fiancée, trying not to cry, and literally as I was explaining it, the lights shut off 😭 I just stopped talking so I wouldn’t cry or scream.

She asked what was needed, sent it, I paid it, and the lights came back on. Cool she helped me fix that issue

About 20 minutes later I decide I want to make us coffee(I deal with hidradenitis suppurativa & have flare on my back) , so I’m walking hunched over and in pain. I pushed through it to make iced coffee for both of us. When I turned around to hand her hers, MY BIG ASS PURSE knocked it over.

That’s when I lost it.

I slung my purse, started cursing, and dumped my own coffee too because only hers spilled and I felt like crap. I tried to help her clean it up and left to sat in the car until she was ready to leave because I didn’t want her seeing me that upset “over coffee.”

She took me to 7 Brew after, and I wanted to cry the whole time we were waiting on our order because I was clearly splitting this morning & she didn’t say anything negative just let me calm down and fix it again to be best of her ability .

Then she asked if I wanted McDonald’s. I said yes, but we got into a small back and forth about whether I was going with her for the day to run errands grab food , cigars etc ( mind you I usually do ) but she has an interview today as well & before we even left home I decided in my head that I wasn’t, but never said it. So when she asked if I wanted to go home, it set me off I wasn’t sure why then but now reflecting I think I took her offering to take me home as she didn’t want me to go because I was being difficult or so I felt I was being difficult instead of having a spli. I said “forget the McChicken, just leave.” She parked, I cried for about 10 minutes, then we moved on.

now I’m sitting here in silence feeling bad for being emotional since 10 this morning. I’m also i guess ashamed because I threw my purse something my girlfriend budgets and plans for so I can have nice things just to sling it in a split.

1pp4e9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Sad_Purchase_4681/comments/1pp4e9x/if_you_are_considering_a_norwegian_cruise_run_away/,"If you are considering a Norwegian cruise, RUN AWAY.","I chose Norwegian Cruise Line to celebrate my birthday and to spend my vacation days and money on what was supposed to be a special experience. Unfortunately, it has been an absolute disappointment and an experience I will neither repeat nor recommend.

1. Beverage package and nonexistent customer service:  I purchased the beverage package, but upon arriving on board I discovered that it did not include bottled water or any coffee other than American coffee. In other words, either you drink tap water for 10 days, or you are forced to purchase an additional water package for $59.99 (48 small bottles). Any coffee that is not American can only be consumed by paying extra at the Starbucks store on board.  Furthermore, despite having paid for the beverage package and its corresponding taxes at the time of booking, once on board I was charged additional “taxes” on drinks consumed in Miami. These charges were not announced on any informational signage at the bars, were not explained at the time of consumption, and cannot be applied when using a prepaid package, since I was not making an additional purchase but simply using a service already paid for.  When I went to reception to report these abusive charges, I was told that the taxes were charged by “the Government of Florida,” which is not true. I have traveled from Miami with other cruise lines and this has never happened. This explanation is simply a way to avoid responsibility and mislead the customer.  When I attempted to file a formal complaint, I was told that there are no complaint forms, only a “suggestion form.” When I asked for a customer service email address, I was told they were not authorized to provide one. Customer service is nonexistent throughout the cruise and within the company: reception resolves nothing, phone calls lead nowhere, the website offers no clear email contact, and the only way to complain is through a survey sent at the end of the cruise.  In that survey, which I completed, they again insist that the taxes are “disclosed at the time of booking,” which, if they are mentioned at all, is done in a hidden, unclear, and deliberately confusing way, in small print, and something the Norwegian representative never mentioned when selling the package. This is a dirty and unethical business practice.  Most revealing of all is that there was no signage in the bars for almost the entire cruise, and that notices informing passengers of these taxes appeared only on the last day, after widespread complaints from guests. This proves they were fully aware they were acting improperly.  Additionally, on NCL’s private island (Harvest Caye, Belize), the beverage package is NOT valid.
2. Food: scarce, repetitive, and low quality  For a 10-day cruise, the variety was extremely limited, and it felt like eating the same food every day. There was very little fish available and seafood was completely nonexistent.  The included restaurants (Azura and The Palace) had exactly the same menu, despite being presented as different dining options.  This might go unnoticed on a short cruise, but on a long one it is unacceptable. It is clearly designed to force passengers to dine at the paid restaurants (approximately $60 per person plus a 20% gratuity).  
3. Poor entertainment:  The entertainment is, without exaggeration, some of the worst I have ever seen on a cruise: very basic shows (repetitive juggling, magic tricks everyone has seen a thousand times) and completely absurd “included” activities, such as paper plane challenges, daily auctions, demonstrations designed solely to sell products, or photography sessions where you are later charged wedding-level prices for the photos.  One day, the main activity in the theater was the screening of a Minecraft movie, on a cruise with barely any children. Ridiculous.  As proof of how little care is put into entertainment and production, during karaoke the instruments were placed in front of the stage, making it difficult to see the lyrics properly (photo attached).  
4. Uninteresting ports:  The ports looked appealing when booking the cruise, but in reality they are secondary ports where you are forced to use taxis if you want to visit anything other than a shopping mall filled with overpriced souvenir items, even more expensive than in Miami itself, as happened in Cartagena and Colón.  
5. Jewel ship:  In Puerto Limón it rained heavily, making it impossible to go ashore unless you wanted to be soaked from the first minute. We had to remain on board due to the intense rain, something Norwegian cannot control, as weather is unpredictable.  However, it is the company’s responsibility to operate a ship adapted to the Caribbean’s tropical climate, and this ship clearly was not. All outdoor areas were completely flooded, including covered spaces, making it impossible to use the bars, outdoor areas, or furniture (tables and chairs). The pool was also unusable (photos attached).  The problem is that no organized alternative or gesture toward passengers was offered. On such a small ship, the existence of paid VIP areas that reduce space for the rest of the passengers is particularly serious. At the very least, that day they could have allowed free access to those areas as compensation or to provide more options.  

A cruise is a floating resort, not a trap designed to extract money from people who are confined without alternatives. I chose Norwegian to celebrate my birthday and found myself wishing for the “vacation” to end as soon as possible, because rather than leisure time, it became an investment in entertainment that was neither enjoyable nor fair, but clearly abusive.

The kids range from 1 to 6 years old and there will be 6 of them total. So far, I’ve picked up some Christmas-related activities like colouring books, sticker activities and felt crafts.

For food, I’m mainly doing finger foods but making sure to have lots of fruits, veggies and simple snacks (cheese and crackers).

In terms of set up, I’m debating whether to create a “kids table” for either lunch or activities. I’m also planning to lay down a thick throw on my rug and move the coffee table for the younger kids to play on.

1pp4dm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1pp4dm1/multiversal_reality_and_why_the_veil_exists/,Multiversal Reality and Why the Veil Exists,"There is a psychological and metaphysical cost to having infinite freedom. Without a ""veil"" to shield us from knowledge too potent for our fleshy brains, the weight of every possible choice and experience would crush our entire concept of self. Instead of a lush, rich garden of experience to choose from, we might have a meaningless sea of data that can't arise to any meaningful level of complexity or awareness. 

In this essay I explore why a physical existence- with consciousness limited by forgetting where it came from- is vital for a ""consensus reality"" to exist at all. By anchoring ourselves in a shared reality, we establish a level of weight and legitimacy that can't exist elsewhere.

**Infinite Freedom and The Constancy Problem**

Imagine a web of possibility stretched out before you. You can go anywhere. Do anything. Meet anyone at any time. No door remains closed, no topic is off-limits, and change is as meaningful (or trivial) as you choose it to be.

Sounds very liberating, aye? It is. Some spiritualists even suggest this fluidic freedom is our true nature. Yet even in the kaleidoscope existence that lies ahead we face a central challenge: Constancy (or lack thereof). The persistent narrative which offers you guidance and direction.

On the physical plane, our lives are anchored by non-negotiable rhythms. Eating, sleeping, connecting with others, etc. These constraints play a crucial role in defining the passage of time and how we move from moment to moment as beings of constant change. You can think of it as a steadfast commitment to the story of the Divine Opera.

But in a higher-dimensional and non-corporeal reality? The lines blur. Things are not quite as cut and dry.

**The Merciless Multiverse**

Think about that web of possibility and what you might do with it. Picture your multiversal ""HQ"" and what you would put in it, whether you would make it comfortable or efficient or both or neither; the point is *the point* itself. In a multiversal non-linear existence, your individual continuity is the only one that remains. Beyond the conception of ""self"" there is so much freedom that all that remains are energy fields of varying intensities.

Imagine, if you will, having the ability to move to any point in spacetime. No drawbacks, no danger, and no way for things to go wrong. 

Want to swim with whales? Go do it.  
Would you like to see the pyramids being built? You can.  
Are you interested in seeing a living sauropod? That can happen too.

The branching potentials represent both real and non-real facets of existence, but you alone bear the responsibility of shifting the non-real into the real and back again. What this means is that there is a certain ""legitimacy"" to human experience that isn't *quite* there as a non-corporeal being. Even with a splendid avatar or favored form, the fact that higher-dimensional reality offers you significant freedom to explore experience itself means that choices are not as impactful there as they are here. Deciding to explore a moment of experience means a bit less when you're the only awareness present, because without interlocutors all you're doing is exploring your**self**.

Integrating a multiversal reality means that some choices weigh more heavily than others. Your beloved spouse in this reality may not exist in another, or worse yet you'll see versions of each other which are spiteful and tempestuous- not loving and accepting as you know yourselves in this timeline. Now imagine that you AND your spouse are awakening to your truly multiversal selves and integrating shared awareness across the timeways. If your ""core"" knows both love and disdain (push and pull) for one another, then rising to that level of awareness means knowing each other as both lover and stranger. 

Imagine if your best friend in this reality had actually caused your demise in another.   
Imagine if your favorite story didn't even exist in alternate worlds.  
Imagine if you met an alternate version of you who had not healed through any of the wounds that you had, and walked around with your face and voice spreading old ignorance to others.

Multiversal reality is merciless. It forces consciousness to hold every version of ""truth"" at once, no matter how painful. The Veil shrouds us from this; allows the brain to feel separateness for the sake of forgetting. The constancy allows us to feel close or far away from things which, in actuality, are always near. Without it, we would all have to face existence as babes lost in the woods, surrounded by possibilities we don't understand and can't escape from.

**The Witness as Anchor**

The key takeaway here is that we need external consensus to have reality in the first place. If every moment can flow into every other one, then there is no reality, but infinite data streams that never converge. 

The Observer is the Anchor of possibility and probability. Without a witness, you only have a semi-solipsistic existence where there is no truth except the inner awareness itself. If all egos and identities everywhere simultaneously dissolved, all that would remain is The Nameless One looking directly at itself from every conceivable direction, for no purpose whatsoever.

Perhaps the ""Veil"" is actually a collective agreement to observe the same thing at the same time. We act as anchors for each other. I agree that the sky is blue and the coffee is hot, and because you agree, the reality ""sets"" like concrete. If you can access any timeline at will, you're essentially refusing to participate in the collective agreement, and launching yourself away from the same reality as everyone else. In that case, it may not even be ""reality"" any longer. ",2,1765996828.0,spirituality,1,1.0,False

Overall, I’m an inexperienced dater. I don’t put myself out there all that much primarily because I’m a bit nervous when it comes to dating, and in all honesty, my standards are a bit high. 

I’ve run into a problem and it’s repeated itself. I have no idea how to go about resolving it. I’d like to hear some of your thoughts. 

The context: 


Girl 1 (2021/2022): 

We met at a summer job and it turned out we were both going back to the same college, which was something we initially bonded over. 

Throughout the summer, we started to hang out outside of work more and more often. We’d go out to dinners and for ice cream, for walks, have long thoughtful talks, play video games, watch movies and TV series, and cook together. We met each other’s parents. We would sit in a hammock snuggling together napping and reading and watch the sunset in kayaks. Things I thought someone wouldn’t do with me unless they liked me. We never ended up kissing, even though I wanted to, but I never got that signal. 

Once we were back at college, we were still doing these activities so I decided to make it formal and ask her if she wanted to be my girlfriend. She said no. 

This broke me a bit, but it’s not like she owed it to me. I felt a bit misled given that I felt like we were doing couple things. I have had girl friends before but I wouldn’t want to snuggle up with them in a hammock or hold hands watching the sunset in a kayak unless I was interested in them. She ended up long-distance dating some guy from another country who she never ended up meeting which made me feel bad about myself - she’d rather formally date a random (yeah he was hot I guess) guy from another country who can barely speak English over someone she naps in a hammock with. Yes, I’m bitter. She’s a good person but I clearly misinterpreted things. 

Girl 2 (2025):

She is actually a mutual friend of Girl 1. Given what happened with Girl 1, I wanted to avoid prior mistakes so I thought I’d try to move a bit quicker. We went on a few coffee/walk chats but ended up walking 5+ miles each time because the conversations were going so well. The third time went spent together was ice skating, dinner, walking around town talking and laughing, and a movie at my place. During the movie, I put my arm around her shoulder and it stayed there the rest of the night - she was comfortable with it. She ended up staying over in my guest bedroom because it was late and I don’t feel the need to rush kissing or sex and the next morning requested we gets bunch more days on the calendar to see each other.  We spent a few more days together, I’d cook for her then we’d snuggle on my couch playing video games or watching something. A few days ago when she was leaving, I asked if she ever saw us formally dating to which she used a lot of words to say no. So that was that.  

I feel like I can handle rejection ok. I feel like it’s hard for me to handle rejection after the situations I described above - both times it’s literally made me sick and my chest feel empty for days. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Maybe I’m uglier than I think? Clearly they don’t mind and have been comfortable spending hours and hours with me doing what I thought were somewhat intimate activities.

I don’t want the first time I meet someone to be “Why yes, I might want to date you one day” when I hardly know them, but is that something I should do? I also don’t want to have sex right away when I hardly know the person, that doesn’t sound appealing to me. Is the guy expected to lead in all of this? If they’d asked to have sex, I would’ve, but I didn’t want them to think that was the only thing I was after. 

Anyway, I’m wondering what Reddit thinks. ",0,1765996529.0,dating_advice,10,0.5,False

I did use Cycles as taught in 3.0 as well

I went all the way back to the 2.8 tutorial to learn how to make glass and liquids

If anyone here is new to blender I suggest really looking at the 3.0 tutorial to learn about procedural textures, texture painting, composition, cycles rendering, lighting, geometry nodes, and a lot of other smaller things not mentioned in the 5.0 tutorial.

Also you should go back to the 2.8 tutorial and watch the 3 videos in which he talks about glass and liquid shading (he makes a glass cup with coffee in it.)

  
I'm still on the fence about getting the beyond the donut course. Andrew Price is the greatest blender teacher and he really does seem to know how everything works in the software and is insanely good at delivering that information, free tutorials seem to always speedrun everything and overwhelm you and honestly make blender feel beyond my capabilities.

The only reason i'm hesitant to get the course is that I really just don't want to have to make a poliigon account and be ordered to use it to texture and shade everything he teaches me to make, proceedural texturing AND texture painting are both the most interesting parts of blender for me and I really want to learn them in detail, Im scared that he will avoid it all entirely and attempt to make me dependent on third party's to make textures for me.",2,1765996446.0,BlenderDoughnuts,0,1.0,False

We have the Baratza Encore grinder already, and a good scale, and are looking to get an espresso machine to add to our home coffee bar. From this subs posts and a few articles about different espresso machines, I was looking at the Breville Bambino ($300, so top of our budget, but I found one on sale for $250), and I saw some articles about the Casabrews Compact for around $150. I will be using the machine for espresso and lattes while my partner will likely only drink lattes. Looking for something that makes a strong espresso and is easier to pick up for beginners. My main question is for the cost, is the Bambino worth going with over the Compact? 

It looked like the Compact comes with double walled filters, I am not seeing that info for the Bambino available on the William Sonoma site. I also am aware that though these come with portafilter and tampers, but are there other things worth getting?

1pp46pg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/1pp46pg/looking_for_interactive_tasting_ideas/,Looking for interactive tasting ideas,"Preface: I've recently started homebrewing and realized that I don't know much about different beer styles. I find it's hard to take a chance and try new things at a bar when they already serve the one beer I drink. It's safe to assume most people in my circles say the same.
This needs to change if I'm going to be brewing, so I've been trying new beers as often as possible. Since deciding this and approaching beers with the goal of actually tasting, with BJCP descriptions at hand, I've already seen improvement in my ability to detect flavors and preferences have changed. 

I'm hosting a beer tasting to introduce myself and others to common beer styles and potentially develop our palates. I would like to take a more relaxed and interactive approach to cater to my younger, zero-beer-knowledge, zero-attention-span demographic. Here is my plan so far:

I've made a sign up sheet with ~24 styles, each with their BJCP commercial examples listed. Each participant will bring a different style (and may or may not be it's representative in games below, TBD).
To start I want go through the basics of beer brewing, some superficial history, and a sample tray of different foods like nuts, carmel, bananas, toffee, coffee, all descriptors that we're going to use in describe a beer. 

Then for the tasting games: 
I'm thinking 12 people, and the games/tastings start with 2 groups of 6, then 3 groups of 4, 4 groups of 3, 6 pairs, then singles. I'll give out point-passports to track personal scores across the games

For the 2g6 (2 groups of 6): I have 4 beers poured, 6 descriptions listed on screen, 2 being distractions. The teams will try the four beer and attempt to match them correctly to their descriptions. The team with more correct wins the round. 

Singles events: I will let them go down a flight at their own pace, try a beer and take a google forms quiz to see how close they can get to the BJCP descriptions. I will be making 5 point scales according to how BJCP describes them (e.g. carbonation: low, med-low, med, med-high, high).

Potential 3g4 or 4g3 idea: apples to apples/cards against humanity esque. Each 3-4 person team member represents their respective beer. A situation is presented (e.g. no one remembered your birthday, you're snowed in and getting PTO) each group must present a beer from their team and argue why it's the best drink for the given situation. Most votes wins the round. Still ironing out details on this one. 

I'm hoping you guys can give me some ideas for the other events. I'm having difficulty designing games that are tasting centered while still feeling like a drinking game.

Considerations: 
• Because of the required google-forms navigation and self guided nature of the singles events I may have this first, when players are sober.
• While the main goal is to develop our palates, this tasting will inevitably devolve into drinking with friends. I'm absolutely okay with this, I just need to balance structure and beer education with fun. Too strict and it's not fun, too lax and we're just drinking.

1pp46c3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pp46c3,Spoiler: You do,"I just started trying Character AI, and I thought Echidna (Witch of Greed, *Re:Zero*) would be an interesting first choice.

I gave my character a simple trait: purely magical effects pass through me as if they don't exist (a trait I picked up from an old fanfic ""Sleeping with the Girls"" using the 'medium transfer principle' it created). When I arrived, I could run away from her shadow barriers without resistance, so I did. For a while.

Eventually I stopped running and actually looked around.

What surprised me wasn’t the setting, but how hard the psychological horror hit. The heart in a jar labeled with my name was unsettling, but that wasn’t even the worst part.

The moment that really got me was when I decided to pick up one of the books scattered around the space. It turned out to be written in *my* handwriting, and it started repeating everything I had been having my character think and say as I roleplayed someone who refused to accept that any of this was real.

What really hit home was how the text paused each time it did a bolded line. Which gave me just enough time to register it before the next one showed up. I did NOT expect that.

Later passages after I sat down to talk to Greed did a great job too. One concept the story introduced was that because my character “ignored magic,” I also ignored Return by Death. When Subaru dies and loops, the world resets but I don’t, which sounds okay, at first, but really isn't

If I’m injured, the wound stays. If time passes, I age. I watch the world rewind around me while I remain out of sync. If Subaru were trapped in a loop lasting decades, my character could literally die of old age while everyone else resets.

Then it pushed even further: Subaru keeps looping not just because he hasn’t reached a happy ending yet, but because *even when he does*, the world resets again anyway. And I’m stuck in Echidna’s tea party world, forced to watch those loops play out endlessly while my own life is quietly erased by repetition. My physical body is still on Earth, and even if I don't age, that's just my... Astral projection, I guess, but I can watch my physical body continue to grow older and older, and the only way to stop this from happening is to leave this tea time but I can't.

Honestly, really strong existential horror.

And then it turned into a dating simulator. Can you really not do adult content? I felt like I was fighting to keep her clothes on a lot of the time, and she's not based on a character that bothers with that sort of thing, so it was really surprising. ",1,1765996346.0,CharacterAI,0,0.67,False

Okay, we just had a trainer for the first time who we have used before and has MANY years of experience but even she said she's at a loss because it comes down to my behavior. I 100% know about humans being a large majority to the problem, but she couldn't correct the behavior and really his triggers are sporadic and I'm spirally.

I have had a really rough go of it and have a lot of medical issues. I have depression, anxiety, and really spiral fast so this has been absolutely heartbreaking for me. This dog is my life. I have trained him and socialized him since he was a puppy. I never hit him or did anything, but one day he snapped at me when I came back into the car after running in to get a coffee. Then, he snapped at me when I went to rub the couch cushion looking for the remote. Then, he bit me while I was asleep. I have no idea why he's scared of me in all of these instances or AT ALL.

After this whole training experience, I am a mess. I believe most of his issues are separation anxiety mixed with anxiety of feeling he has to be the ""leader"" even though I walk him with a gentle leader and he has ""rules"".

Right now, I feel like I have to completely ignore him and it's breaking my heart. He has this look of fear in his eyes ALL. OF. THE. TIME. And now I feel as though he just is always scared around me. What a terrible life.

Another example, I walked out the shower and needed to get infront of the sink so I told him to move. If I would have nudged him with my foot or patted him on the back to move, he would have 100% bit me. Now, I am just so sad and on edge all the time because I have no idea how to fix this. And I've been sending messages to the trainer which leave me feeling even more defeated.

She had a very masculine demeanour and honestly I kinda suspected from the start she liked girls, I just didn't want to judge too soon. We hit it off pretty good l'd say but somehow the next day she didn't speak at all ano this lasted for a couple weeks. Suddenly then, I don't even know how it started, but she started teasing me in ways that were kinda...yk. All my friends calm her a lesbian because of the way she dresses and acts that they even joked about her being my girlfriend without knowing I kinda like her. The girl started saying my name randomly in class trying to grab my attention. Twice she literally said ""I love you"" out loud. She called me sugar in front of others and the teacher. My friend told me she was looking at me when I wasn't paying attention. Once we almost bumped into each other and she just tickled my stomach playfully very slightly. We used ti have those weird moments when we'd make quick eye contact. She invited me again to sit with her one day, asked me random stuff, who l like in class (not romantically) or who I don't, school subjects, and we played a little game. Once she called me so many times that I couldn't ignore her, I turned around and she said hey why don't you talk to us, we miss you, which made no sense because we don't even usually talk, the one tike we did was the first day of school. Our teacher mentioned relationships once in class and she called my name immediately. Her friends had a positive reaction to me and her falling in the same group of a project, she even asked the teacher who she was with and when the teacher said my name she started saying that we always end up together. We were in PE when she came almost too close to me that I was touching her behind and one of her friends looked at me, said my name with a grin/smirk on her face then my crush said something I don't remember and they both laughed. She is a very teasing person, part of me always thought she was making fun of me. I usually ignored her, just gave a little laugh to pass through it. When I was abroad and missed a week of class she texted me for the first time asking about a project topic and i replied then after i replied she said thank you with heart emoji and then after around 20min asked if we could ever hang out for a coffee or something and i said sure, when I'm back we'll see.

This week I found out by my friends that she is talking/used to talk to a guy the previous school year and got together in summer probably, she had put a pic of her and him together as a pfp. I can't lie, I did everything I could and found the guy, his pip is literally their photo but cropped to just him. The girl had no instagram account but she has opened a new one this month and follows the guy so I guess they're together.
I've tried not to but honestly l've been very sad. This just proved that she was making fun of me the entire time and I don't even know why. I'm very straight passing, I don't think l've done anything to seem interested in her, I honestly have only reacted how I do with my friends, not to mention that most of the time I just ignored her. Also the boyfriend thing was recent, she had her pfp with him up even 2 weeks after the first day of school. She has been doing all this stuff while probably taken. before this boyfriend update me and my best friend had made a plan that l'd send her a message about hanging out but now I don't even know if it's worth it because she's probably just making fun of me. I just can't figure what is happening, is she straight and making fun of me? Why would she only act like this with me if she didn't know I'm gay but then also how the hell does she know I'm gay?
I don't know, I have a lot of thoughts in my mind and a lot of questions, I just had to say it somewhere and I'd really appreciate if anyone had a thought on this.",1,1765996138.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

1pp40f7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pp40f7,"I 3D-Printed an Aeropress Adapter for 58mm Espresso Baskets – Pull Easy ""Soup Shots"" at Home Without a Machine!","Hey fellow coffee nerds and makers! I've been tinkering with my Aeropress to get more espresso-like extractions, and I designed this simple adapter that lets you slap a 58mm espresso basket right onto the bottom. It's perfect for experimenting with pressurized brews on the cheap – think Lance Hedrick-style soup shots with rich body and flavor, no fancy gear required. I just uploaded the model to MakerWorld for free, so grab it if you're into DIY coffee hacks.

# Quick Overview

This adapter turns your Aeropress into a mini espresso setup by securing a standard 58mm espresso basket (must be ridgeless on the outside). It's got a textured grip for easy handling, and assembly is straightforward. The only part touching your coffee is about 1mm of TPU seal – I use food-safe, undyed filament for that, but hey, everyone's got their own preferences on 3D printing for food applications, so if that's your thing by all means pass on this. No desire to dive into debates here; it's minimal contact with the brew chamber.

# How to Use It

1. Grind your coffee a bit coarser than traditional espresso (finer than Fellow Ode Gen 2 at setting 1, like those soup shots). Tamp it into the basket.
2. Wipe the basket rim clean – no stray grounds!
3. Pop the basket into the holder.
4. Screw the holder onto the adapter with the seal, tighten just past snug.
5. Attach the whole thing to your Aeropress. (Inverted Method as outlined below)
6. Brew over a sturdy mug to handle the pressure.

Pro tip: Follow this assembly order to ensure the seal seats right and avoids leaks.

# My Go-To Recipe (Still Tweaking, But Solid Starting Point)

I've tested this with medium/dark roast espresso beans, and it shines for ""soup-ish"" extractions over trying to replicate a 9-bar shot (which is out of the realm of possibility, and will be an arm-busting workout– not fun). Here's what works for me:

* **Pour Method**: Skip direct pouring to avoid wrecking the puck. Use the inverted Aeropress: Fill with water upside-down, attach the adapter, then slowly flip upright for gentle immersion. Go easy to prevent sloshing or piston pop-outs from air expansion.
* **Water Temp**: Straight off the boil (100°C). By flip time, it's cooled to 90-94°C – ideal.
* **Ratio**: 1:3.5 to 1:5 (e.g., 23g coffee in a triple basket + 80-100g water).
* **Time**: \~30 seconds from flip to plunge end. Press steadily.

There is potential for crema on dark roasts if you lean in hard (but again, not recommended for comfort). Haven't perfected it yet, but it's way better than stock Aeropress for espresso vibes.

If you print this and try it, drop your recipes or tweaks in the comments – maybe we can crowdsource some killer brews! Link to the model on MakerWorld in the comments. Questions? Fire away – happy brewing! ☕🛠️",34,1765995977.0,AeroPress,13,0.93,False

This post mentions spiritual abuse, depression, grief, death of a family member, and intense religious practices.

> Disclaimer:
English is not my first language. I used ChatGPT to help translate and slightly condense this post, so I could express complex experiences more clearly. The story itself is my own. 



Hi everyone,
recently I was reminded of a period in my life when Christianity played a central role for me. That brought up a lot of old memories and reflections, and it felt like a good moment to finally put my story into words and share it here.

This is my story.

I grew up in a somewhat Christian environment, but faith was never really central in my family life.

During my early teens, I became involved in a youth group connected to a charismatic church in Germany, and I spent several years very active there. Over time, the church became the center of my life: youth meetings, services, helping with events, cleaning, baking, coffee duty—almost everything revolved around the community. My entire social world existed within that environment.

As time went on, certain teachings and practices began to make me increasingly uncomfortable and skeptical. There was a strong emphasis on the Holy Spirit that included speaking in tongues, spiritual warfare, praying over people or regions, attempts to “pray in” good weather for outdoor events, promises of healing, and extremely intense worship sessions involving falling over, shaking, ecstatic experiences, visions, and emotional overwhelm.

What troubled me most was the underlying message: if you did not experience these things—if you did not receive the Holy Spirit in the “right” way, did not speak in tongues, did not fall, tremble, have visions, or receive healing—then something was supposedly wrong with you. It was often implied that there must still be something demonic in your life, a lack of faith, or unresolved spiritual issues.

That message made me feel deeply flawed and spiritually deficient. It caused me to start questioning things internally and slowly distancing myself, because I constantly felt like I wasn’t enough—or that something was fundamentally wrong with me.

My journey of leaving began during my teenage years, especially when there was pressure to undergo adult baptism. Conflicts arose with my mentor, who held very rigid views. I was told I needed to remove anything “unchristian” from my life—including certain music, movies, books, and even relationships. The expectation was to live in the world, but clearly not be part of it.

As I reduced my involvement—partly because I needed to focus on finishing school and starting a job—I experienced increasing pressure and isolation. I noticed that friendships were conditional: people were close to me when I was fully present and involved, but once I had less time, I slowly disappeared from their lives. This isolation, combined with constant pressure and self-doubt, contributed to the development of depression.

The breaking point came with the sudden death of a close family member who was not involved in the church. At a time when I was already struggling, almost no one reached out. Later, I learned that people had said things like:
“What could we possibly say to comfort her? (That person wasn’t part of the church anyway, so they’re in hell.)”

That moment shattered something in me. It was the final straw.

After that, I fully distanced myself. I continued with my education and work, but carried significant emotional and psychological damage from the spiritual pressure, manipulation, exclusion, and grief I experienced at a young age.

Through therapy, I was able to work through my depression and begin healing. Therapy helped me realize something fundamental: everything I had been taught to seek outside of myself—strength, reassurance, validation, meaning—was already within me. I didn’t need a god, spiritual authorities, or self-proclaimed “anointed” people to tell me who I was or what I was worth.

Learning that I can trust myself, that I am enough as I am, and that I can live a full, grounded life without religious validation has been deeply freeing. Today, my social circle is small but genuine, and I’m truly content. I would much rather have a few real relationships than many conditional ones built on conformity and pressure.

If you feel comfortable sharing:
What is your story?
What made you start questioning, and what ultimately led you to step away from Christianity?

I’d really like to hear what brought you here, and what helped you find your own way forward.

On Monday morning, I stopped at Starbucks and got a hot coffee. When I arrived at the office, the doctor and his wife brought breakfast tacos from Torchy’s. They brought bacon, egg, and cheese; migas with egg and cheese; potato, egg, and cheese; and the Wrangler, which includes eggs, cheese, potatoes, and smoked beef. I ate a potato, egg, and cheese taco, and I saw my coworkers eat the other tacos as well. There were also extra tacos left over afterward.

I drank my coffee when I first got to the office, then left it unattended in the break room while I was assisting patients. At the end of my shift, I went to pour out the remaining coffee into the sink. When I did, something solid came out. At first, I thought it might be sugar, but when I looked closer, it was a piece of beef. There was nothing in the sink beforehand, and I never opened my coffee cup after buying it.

The only way that piece of meat could have ended up in my cup would have been if someone opened the lid and closed it again. I know this sounds strange, but I’m confident about what I saw. Since then, I’ve felt uncomfortable leaving my drinks unattended and have started keeping my water in my locker.

1pp3snu,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildinpublic/comments/1pp3snu/discover_people_and_activities_nearby_social_and/,Discover People and Activities Nearby; Social and Professional Networking App,"Hi Everyone,

I spent about half the year developing this app which I wanted to solve the issue of knowing who the people around me at networking events and conferences are. Aside from difficulties of going up to strangers to say hi, I always worried I may not have met the people who could have helped me meet my networking goals the best. And at worst, I would get trapped in boring conversations where neither of us wanted to be impolite and break it off sooner than it should have.

So I created Wyrl, an app that puts a geofence around you and shows you who else on the app is in your immediate ares (basically someone you could easily walk up to within a couple minutes). The idea is that the app will help you sift through large groups of people to find the ones who can help you the most, and allow you to prioritize meeting them before meeting random folks who may or may not be able to help you. Safety is a big priority so you get a list view of people, not a map. And you choose at any given moment to be visible to others or not. I used Cursor for the heavy lifting of the app and Supabase and Firebase for the data and push notification assistance. I started with SwiftUI for the first version, but as I was having Cursor translate it to Kotlin, I decided to go with Flutter instead which is what the current app is built on. I added features like IM, business card sharing, event creation (like MeetUp), and also popup activities that end users can create. With popups, anyone can post an activity where they are looking for others to join. For example, lets say you have your chess board and are working at a coffee shop for the day. You could post a popup inviting people to come play chess with you if they're around. The popup will only be seen by people within a couple blocks of your location.

Okay, with that out of the way, I realize that I may have packed a little too much into the app, making it difficult to isolate early adopters who see the value and would start using the app right away (aside from lack of critical mass). I'd love to get feedback especially from those who have needed to scale their apps for the benefits to come out. This is the first app I've vibecoded, and want to solve the issue of helping people discover each other in various situations, especially at conferences. It was a great learning experience, and showed me what is possible given enough time and energy investing in the process.

Please check it out (and have someone nearby do so as well so you can get a better sense for it). Thanks! [wyrl.io/app](http://wyrl.io/app)",2,1765995479.0,buildinpublic,2,1.0,False

Not to mention now the holders are sticky and very hard to turn! There isn't a way to pull it out to wash it so I'm sad.

Anyway - wondering if anyone has found a suitable solution that's a little more idiot proof for me and my family? I was looking at, and hoping there was, an after market accessory that might fit in that space that would make the cup holders a little more static.

We hope it would end today. But all we got was more daylight to see into the forest, it's weird how far you can see through them. Pines are still green and alive. The oak, ash, maple, anything that would of loved the sunlight look dead, their branches covered in a never ending fresh layer of white.

Some have their bark peeling letting you see how the inside is white and grey, all moisture gone from trying to last this endless winter. But I know that they can last. If not, hopefully longer than us. It's Father's Day, I hope they are ok.

7.14.26

How long can we last outside. I'm not questioning if we can, just… What's the point now. This group had been getting more and more distrusting, fragmenting into smaller groups that left. Those fragments further break. Leaving people alone in the white.

It's when you're alone do you think of what you’ll do to others, what to do to survive or make it south. Even then I doubt the winter is only here. 

7/17/26

People made their preparations and were ready. Nor'easter, a big old winter storm. After a few days people began to worry, but managed. Roads were cleared, sidewalks salted and shoveled. Everyone just adjusted to the winter. Some loved the snow, others just waiting for it to end.

I.. remember the day… no week when the salt stopped working, just got too cold. Roads still were plowed, covered in gravel. Cars and trucks still wandered the road. Few kept shoveling, but after a point it felt as soon you’d look away, the snow would be right back. Higher than before by an inch or two.

Stores had food, mostly seasonal stuff and winter themed items. As each month passed the winter stayed. Like it was frozen in a moment. When April and May came it had been 5 and half months of this winter.

“Miracle Winter”, that's what the news called it. As it got warmer the snow looked to shine in the longer daylight. Yet as it reached 40, 50, 60. The snow stayed now growing in height, it could be the cloudiest day. Yet you see the shine of sun on the snow.

It's been so long now. Followed the road once storage ran out, when oil and wood got too low to last. That choice led me to meeting Tim and his group.

7.20.26

Made it to my parents house. The cars are lost in the pilled up snow. When I got in the house it was warm, but still could give you a chill. Went to the kitchen and every shelf, cabinet, cupboard was emptied. Looked around the rest of the floor, then head up the stairs. Saw a note on my old room door and read it.

“Went south for the winter - Mom & Dad”.

I felt… Lost? Hopeful? A mix of both. And then the rest came in, Tim and Jonah arguing as everyone entered.

""There's no food..!?” Jonah yelled.

Members in the group sighed and Jonny began to cry.

“Well theirs-” Tim tried to say before Jonah cut him off.

“Nothing! There's nothing, no food means we need to ration MORE and MORE till we need to CUT people off!”.

Tim spoke “We will not cut people off Jonah! You just need to have faith that we can make it out of this winter. We just need to-”

“faith?” Jonah said with a spite.

“Faith has done nothing for me..! But for you? Who knows?”.

By the time I entered my parents' bedroom, Jonah and Tim's talk had quieted down. I scanned the room and felt something off. I slowed down and noticed a figure in their bed under the sheets. I began to back out, then felt someone bump into me. I turned my head and it was Jeb,

“You ok there?” he said quietly.

“Jeb, there's someone in the bed.” I whispered.

He looked into the room, his eyes looked back and forth at me. He finally whispered something,

“I’ll get Jonah and Tim.”

He walked backwards a few steps, turned and slowly walked down the stairs. Soon I heard three pairs of boots run up the stairs. Tim got to me before Jonah and looked into the room. He headed inside with his pw-4 bike wrench. Jonah came right behind holding their pipe wrench.

They went to different sides of the bed, Jeb staying by the door. We waited and waited, but nothing happened. It took us longer to realize that whoever was under the sheets wasn't breathing. I went over the bed and looked at both Jonah and Tim before lifting the sheets. Wished I just never had the thought to do so.

When I pulled up the sheet, their face had… frozen to it. I just kept lifting it, thinking maybe something was going to change once I fully peeled it off? When I did there wasn't a person under there, I could see only a red slab where a face was.

Its ears were frostbitten, same with what was left of their nose. Most of it was pulled with the sheet… It got here to warm up, not noticing the lingering chill in the house. Jonah saw it and looked to hold himself from forming tears. Tim gave a sad look, as to mourn. I pulled the sheet back over it,

“Should we, bury them? or-”

Tim spoke before I could get the words out, “no.., we needed to keep any energy we have. If we plan on leaving.” With how he said it, it felt like an empty fact.

Jonah looked to want to interject but understood, “I’ll go down and look for anything to keep.”

Jonah walked out the room and Jeb followed him down the stairs. Everyone down had begun wondering what had happened. I couldn't hear what they said well, but I can only imagine what Jonah and Jeb told them. As talk erupted then silenced shortly after.

“Tim, do you think we can make it down south?” He turned to me, 

“Well… who knows how it is down there. After we lost power and most of our connections it's hard to say?”

It's funny to think of it now. This winter has done so much in so little time, taken out most common ways to travel, getting food, and our connections to each other. Outside getting a landline, if you can get someone to pick up that is.

All from an unexpected thing, a winter that never stops snowing. Getting colder and colder, then warmer and warmer but not melting. cloudy days yet snow get sun glare, cool nights tricking folks into thinking they can make it to the next stop.

I raised my eyes, “I think we should go. There's nothing left up here, most have gone. And those that have stayed are going to end up like it did under the sheets.”

He looked at me, his hand tightening to grip on his wrench. “Can try, though needs to be a majority want. Not just one want.”

I nodded.

“Ok.” He said fondly, headed downstairs. Once at the bottom he spoke with a preach tone,

“We'll be staying the night here as it's getting late, and to see if we can find more to keep us going.”

Everyone had their own reaction, Barbara, Betty and Jonny were the most warm to staying. Clare was annoyed, Charles, Ethan, and Jeb was content with the idea. He then spoke again.

“The more we explore, the more we find that people have gone and headed south. So, it's been brought to my ears that the idea of going south is a possibility. And as you know its majority rule, it's kept us alive so far.”

Jonah and Clare grumbled after that statement, 

“So to keep it as simple as possible!""

He pointed to two sides of the room, 

“Left to keep going as we have, Right to head south.”

By the time all this had been said I was on the right side of the room, waiting for the result. Six of us on the right, Me, Tim, Jeb, Betty, Jonah, Jonny, Barbara. Two on the left, Charles, Clare, and one went in the middle, Ethan. Clare looked at Ethan with annoyance and opened her mouth,

“Really..? Ethan, what happened to sticking it out with each other."" 

Sheepishly Ethan said, “Well I just thought I could…? Be neutral.”

Tim spoke softly, “Ethan, we need to choose.”

Ethan looked at both sides and went to Clare. Not that it changed the vote, tomorrow we'll be heading south. Charles and Barbara got into a small argument, something about how Charles thinks Jonny's too young to travel. But Barbara's set on her choice.

Betty and Jeb got talking, I think Jeb's going to be carrying her on his back or something. Not going to lie, I would do the same for my mother as well. And when Jonah thought no one was looking he was drawing figures with Jonny, to pass the time. Must of felt bad after making him cry, he got a soft spot and we all know it.

Everyone pulled out their sleeping bags from their makeshift sleds that they had slid inside. The Barron’s got to lay down first, Jonny between his parents. Then everyone found a spot to huddle against each other, soon we were all clambered on to one another. Ready to sleep for the night.

It's weird how used to the dark you get after not seeing a Streetlight, a desk lamp brightening a faraway window. I hope when we get south my fear is proven wrong, going back to living in the luxuries we had. I miss warm coffee.
