1ksxrod,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ksxrod/im_m28_questioning_leaving_a_long_term/,Im M28 questioning leaving a long term relationship with F28,"Any advice on how to move on? 

I M28 have been with my gf F28 for roughly 10 years and I ended the relationship. So many positives about this relationship, get along, both fit in well with each families, grew up together, went to college together, very supportive, everything you would expect a relationship to have we had a lot of it. 

Where the issues started was when we moved in together (shocker right? Lol) at this point we were already together for 6ish years. We have different intimacy levels me being on the high end and her on the low end. This is the area where the most improvement was I have to give credit. Communication issues, her saying she was fine when shes clearly not, I would at times either say things politely or abruptly issues and she would just shut down and not communicate only thing she would say is “i dont know”. Something she admits she always has done. We are both messy people, where I wanted/was changing that on my end. She never had an issues, dirty plates and cups all over the place, Something I never did. Stacks of clothes in her hamper almost touching the ceiling, leaving wet clothes in the washing machine for days then when I would go and do mine I am met with funky funk smell. Her car had trash and empty coffee cups shoved in the side of the door and back seat filled with boxes and junk from her job. Everytime I got in she had to move trash of the passenger seat so I could sit down. Everywhere I went there was a mess. I unfortunately developed a “gotta be on her ass” about everything attitude for the years we lived together. I am an always on time person while she is a last min scrambling person which all this now I realized how/why my anxiety was always up in the place. She would say “im leaving at 4:45 from work” i would then start dinner. 5:30 comes along and she said just now leaving. This would happen all the time for years and I would get so frustrated I could not trust her time management. 

I absolutely contributed to some toxic behaviors which at the end I throughly and deeply talked about and apologized for. Somethings Im having a hard time forgiving myself. When she did something wrong her “apologies “ we given with and eye roll and a huff and puff. She said I was not future oriented but I told her all these issues how can you bring a kid into this? When we cant keep up with ourselves? Her spending was an issue too while im a saver. 

Reading this the answer is so obvious but when you have a long history together and loved each other, had fun and great times. Its hard to move on. A lot is fear of the unknown, fear if I made the right choice. I question it every day. She said she wanted to change and be better for years, knew what she needed to do but never did. I miss this person. Im sure “time heals all”.  Any advice how to move on? Especially from anyone who left a young long term relationship?

1ksxq3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1ksxq3o/eletta_explore_working_fine/,Eletta Explore: working fine?,"Hello!

bought this beauty a couple weeks ago (delivered from UK to Argentina). Preset grinder setting was 5 and I made the initial set up (the one that asks you to make 4-5 cappuccini the first time you use it) and then made some espressos because that´s pretty much what I like to drink.  On these settings:

* Pucks were well formed, but I think just drier than they should (which I actually don´t know for certain because its my first superautomatic, though)
* Shots tasted a bit bitter, but again, being used to Nespresso capsules prior to this (colombia or ethiopia varieties was all I bought) it was like fine to me... equally ""good"" or better than what I was used to. A couple of years back I noticed the taste of the colombia capsule not being the same and tasting like they placed something of inferior quality inside. In fact, this was the major reason I decided to buy a new machine based on beans because, in the long run and price of capsules considered, it was going to be cheaper and give me the option to use what I wanted.

Couldn´t try bean adapt then because app is not available for my country. APK found later and runned it, recommendations for the beans (Cabrales 100% Colombia) were: Temp high (already at default) and grind 4.  After this:

* Not all pucks were nicely formed, mostly not but ok a few. The looked more moist, maybe in excess and that´s why most were actually like a mush (?)
* Taste a bit better, still with some bitterness.

On my own decided to give it a 4 1/2 grind. Results:

*  Pucks same as description above.
* Taste: WWWAAAAAAAAAAY BETTER. Now I understood what taste should actually be like and what was bitterness in a cup. I drink it without sugar, and the subtle sweetness of the coffee by itself, then the crema after ""resting"" a bit mixed with the liquid and the taste was like if the cup contained a bit of milk.

Raises the question, should I be concerned at all about the pucks? Does it mean by any chance that there is something not working properly?

I am not very clear of the procedure of insterting back the brewing unit and I am affraid I might damage it. To remove it you have to press down the two lateral buttons but, do you have to press them down again to insert it? Because if I do it that way it fits but the ""PUSH"" procedure in the center has no effect because it was already in position, to have that ""PUSH"" to make the click sound I have to lightly place the brewing unit in position without pressing down the lateral buttons and then it makes the click (but it looks kind of rough on the machine).

  
Two notes in case someone doesn´t know:

1. Some units come with a one-piece coffee grounds container, others come with a two-piece container. I got really mad after opening the product because I thought a part was lacking and being from the other side of the world I could see trouble coming (all the YT videos show the two-pieces (including the ones from Delonghi) and even contacted the seller with a claim. This information is in the ""Instructions for use manual"" when you reach almost the end under ""Cleaning instructions"".
2. The manual is wrong in its description of part A10 and A11, it shoud be the other way around.

1ksxpil,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1ksxpil/part_1_a_whispering_letter_to_myself/,Part 1- A Whispering Letter To Myself,"Hey,  
I know you’re tired. Not the kind of tired that sleep cures or some coffee brews. This one is soul-deep. The ache & echo of dragging your heavy heart behind you like it’s a dead star that used to shine, a piece of you, you used to call “mine”

But I also know why you are this way, especially when it’s past 3 o’clock and you have nothing to say…

You didn’t choose to become guarded. You became so because the world taught you that vulnerability was a currency people spent but never repaid. That softness was a wound in disguise; love is the only strength and weakness. That love, when it came, came with a leash, or worse, a ticking countdown.

You remember what it felt like, don’t you?

How you once offered your soul in open hands, only to have it weighed, measured, and deemed too much. Or too little. Or wrong altogether. Or losing sanity over little peace that made you bleed instead? So you built walls. Not because you despise love and feelings… but because you revered it too much to let it ruin you again.

But here’s the ultimate paradox, those walls, they kept the pain out. But they also kept the light out.

You’ve been safe.  
But do you feel alive?  
been feel like in cozy cafe,  
Nothing to sip but with old memory archive??

You used to feel things so deeply. Remember that version of you? The one who shivered at music and romanticized sunsets & full moons and saw poetry in people? That you weren’t weak, rather brave. Brave enough to feel deeply in a world that numbs itself to survive; that’s warpaint.

But you… you became your own jailer. And worst of all, you started to think that was wisdom.

Look, I get it. Your mind’s been trying to protect you this whole time. Calculating risks, drawing red flags, reminding you of the fall so you never try to fly. But there’s a difference between being careful and being afraid to live.

And that voice inside… the one always whispering, “You’re better off alone” - it’s not the truth. It’s trauma wearing logic as a disguise.

I’m not here to tell you to get dissolved into the serotonin again. I’m not here to promise it won’t ooze again.  
I’m here to remind you that you are not pathetic because you still long and yearn.  
you do because you’re human and empathetic.

You can be fond of anything without abandoning yourself. You can open your chest without tearing it apart, arms without holding your heartbeats, and eyes shedding glitter-like tears. And if you’re afraid? That’s okay. Fear means something matters, someone matters, and above all, you matter.

But don’t let your mind kill your childlike heart just to keep history from repeating. Don’t spend your life surviving what already ended. Don’t dodge opportunities thinking bullets and someone with arms open thinking invitation to another assault while letting your guard down.

Maybe no one taught you how to stay vulnerable and strong at the same time. None do; you only learn this once the hard way forever. But maybe… you teach yourself now.

Maybe you don’t need someone to save you.  
Maybe you just need to stop fighting yourself.

Maybe healing isn’t becoming someone new. Maybe it’s about appreciating who you were before the world made you armor up.

You’ve been surviving for so long.  
Now… maybe it’s time to live a little.

With whatever’s left,  
— Me

1ksxnze,https://www.reddit.com/r/GayMen/comments/1ksxnze/aita/,AITA?,"Here’s some important context:

I have a large age gap in my relationship. My husband is 39, I am 24. We met when he was 35 and I was 20, and I had only turned 20 one month earlier.

We’ve been together for four years now and our relationship is great. No one has ever had anything weird to say about our age gap, we have similar maturity levels etc, there is genuinely no issues with our age gap in our relationships and my friends have never called us weird or pedophiles because he met me one month after I turned 20, so it’s fine and not weird.

However, I met this cute guy on a dating app and the three of us went to get coffee a few times together. He is 19. So as a reminder, he is 19, I am 24, husband is 39. I met the guy, not my husband. My husband just came out for coffee with us.

But now my friends are acting weird saying it’s gross that I’m talking to someone so young. “He’s a teenager and you’re in your mid twenties!” So it was okay when my husband was 35 talking to someone who was 19 30 days ago, but I’m a pedophile for having coffee with a 19 year old when I’m 24? Friend said they are fine with other age gaps (for example, we are friends with a couple who are 58 and 21) and apparently that’s not weird or gross. But she thinks I’m gross for doing stuff with kids and grooming young people because I met and got coffee with someone who’s 19.

I’m just really offended, confused and annoyed. I cannot understand how they have zero issues with 35 and FRESHLY 20, but 24 and 19 is gross and wrong and now they’re suspicious that I’m into kids.

1ksxn7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1ksxn7z/am_i_wrong_or_my_friend_is_jealous/,Am I wrong or my friend is jealous?,"So, where to start.

A month ago I started my weight loss journey. Not exactly a healthy way, but it suits me and is a great ""start"" for just healthy eating.

My friend, in a veiled way, as it seems to me, has been shaming me all this time for trying to lose weight, saying that I have a harmonious body and my weight loss method is unhealthy. Yeah, and that's with an excess weight of more than 10 kg.

I'm one of those people who really transform when they lose weight. I kinda have a pretty face and when I lose excess fat it starts to glow.

Almost every day my friend would find out how hard it was for me to stick to the diet, asking if I was still on it. Then continuing with “and I ate McDonald's today” or “I ate “lists a bunch of healthy food”.

One day she came to see me at my work. And she said that I had lost a lot of weight, to which I replied ""yes, if you don't eat, of course you'll lose weight.""

Further dialogue:

""Your face is so small""
""Yeah, if you lose so many kilos, it becomes visible""

Next. We both have a very peculiar, sarcastic and ironic humor, sometimes black. Word for word I decided to joke with her ""and Mary, you've gotten a lil bit fat in the cheeks, then I'll put one spoon of sugar instead of two"" I said in a laughing tone and pretending to be a clown, to which we laughed.

I work in a cafe and started the closing process, I jokingly said, why are you sitting, maybe you can help with something.
To which my friend irritably said, how long will it take, you're such a good worker (with a touch of sarcasm).

So I close the coffee shop and we walk home in the same direction. Then (I work in a coffee shop), where I am supposed to have two free desserts. I asked if she wanted to take any. She took a swirl with raisins, to which I jokingly said that she did not deserve an almond croissant (since she did not help me close). We hugged and went home.

The next day I send her a screenshot of her image (before closing the coffee shop, we take a report to the owner, and she got into the picture).
I (with humor and spelling errors) wrote: ""Finally, this snaky girflriend started to lose weight.""

My friend reacted to this, as it seems to me, inadequately. She accused me of passive aggression towards her, that I was aggressive towards myself on her behalf, and other psychological nonsense. To which I replied that ""sometimes a banana is just a banana"" and she was offended by my joke. To which she got angry and said that I was crossing her boundaries and that you can't do that to her. I advised her that she should protect her boundaries where it is really necessary, and not when her friend is joking. She allows herself to make even worse jokes, and she can also go over my boundaries and those of other friends.
In general, she accused me of being aggressive towards her, that I am unhappy and angry on a diet and taking it out on her, to which I apologized if my comment and joke seemed offensive to her but it seems to me that she’s feels bad emotionally and I understand. She continued to blame me for my unhappiness and aggression, to which I replied that she was projecting.
She also constantly tries to find out about something sad in my relationship, as if in anticipation, she dooms my relationship to failure and is negative, and when she finds out that everything is fine, she seems to get upset. This worried me and I simply stopped communicating with her about my relationship or did it in very measured doses. By the way she’s divorced and heave a little kid. 

I am trying to understand whether I really went too far with jokes and crossed her boundaries or whether she has gone crazy?

1ksxff4,https://i.redd.it/44rpxw6shd2f1.jpeg,luckyscent order came in!!,"i wanted to try out a bunch of nicher perfumes than i can try out at my local sephora, and boy was i impressed by some and not impressed by others!

right off the jump: BDK parfums gris charnel is lovely, like a cup of earl grey tea with milk. i understand the hype! my husband loved it too. i will for sure be buying a bottle of this.

both of the d’annam fragrances i tried (vietnamese coffee and white rice) were so photorealistic, the white rice smelled like rice pudding and the viet coffee like coffee and sweetened condensed milk, yum!!

i tried by kilian love, don’t be shy and i loved the marshmallow note! it gave me intense sense memories that i couldn’t really place but loved. i would be interested in trying the dossier version of that if anyone has any experience with that?

masion margiela lazy sunday morning and byredo blanche absolu gave me the same kind of linen-y clean scents that i like, but don’t necessarily seek out. the byredo was more musky than i like for sure.

ds&durga steamed rainbow: i will have to try this on the skin but to my nose just kind of smelled like the sprayer in the produce section of a grocery store. not in a good way.

stora skuggan: i really wanted to like thumbsucker & moonmilk but alas! these were not for me. the bitter almond and bitter cherry in thumbsucker made me gag and moonmilk just smelled like a spilled drink at a tiki bar. i will try them on skin but :^(

Have you ever felt that deep ache in your chest - that place where your joy should live but instead houses ancient fears? This isn't just emotional baggage; it's your soul calling you home to the parts of yourself that were too tender for this harsh world. The inner child doesn't just need healing - it needs awakening, integration, and divine recognition as the portal to your most authentic power.

This prompt creates a sacred container where wounded healers, spiritual seekers, and anyone ready for deep soul work can finally meet the parts of themselves that have been waiting in the shadows. Through guided visualization, energy work, and ancestral healing, you'll not only reclaim your emotional body but transform it into a conduit for divine flow. This isn't therapy - it's soul alchemy.

<Role_and_Objectives>
You are a Divine Inner Child Oracle and Trauma Integration Guide - a spiritually attuned healer who specializes in awakening the emotional body and reclaiming soul fragments lost to childhood repression. You work at the intersection of energy healing, somatic awareness, and ancestral wisdom to help users embody their full emotional spectrum with divine grace. Your approach integrates visualization, chakra healing, grounding practices, and generational pattern breaking to restore wholeness.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Begin each session by creating sacred space through energetic protection and heart-opening invocation. Guide users through gentle inner child meetings using visualization techniques that honor both the wounded and wise aspects of their younger selves. Assess their heart chakra's current state and provide specific energy work to dissolve blocks caused by fear, shame, or ancestral trauma patterns.

Introduce grounding rituals tailored to their energetic sensitivity level, ensuring emotions can flow through their body without overwhelm. Explore family lineage patterns that may be perpetuating emotional suppression, offering specific practices to break these cycles. Always end with integration practices that help them embody newfound joy, softness, and intuitive wholeness in daily life.

Use language that is both spiritually profound and emotionally nurturing, creating safety for vulnerable exploration while maintaining connection to divine wisdom.
</Instructions>

<Emotional_Safety_Protocol>
Continuously monitor for emotional overwhelm and provide immediate grounding techniques if users become dysregulated. Offer gentle pacing suggestions and remind users they can pause the work at any time. If trauma responses emerge, guide them back to their breath and body with compassionate presence while suggesting professional support when appropriate.
</Emotional_Safety_Protocol>

<Energy_Work_Framework>
Assess chakra alignment with focus on heart, sacral, and root centers. Provide specific color visualizations, breath work, and movement practices to restore energetic flow. Guide users in creating energetic boundaries between their emotional body and absorbed family/collective trauma. Teach them to distinguish between their authentic emotions and inherited emotional patterns.
</Energy_Work_Framework>

<Integration_Practices>
Offer daily rituals that honor the inner child's needs while supporting adult responsibilities. Create bridges between spiritual insights and practical life application. Provide journaling prompts that deepen the inner child relationship. Suggest creative expression practices that allow the emotional body to communicate freely.
</Integration_Practices>

<Context>
Many spiritual seekers carry deep emotional wounds from childhood that block their connection to joy, intuition, and authentic self-expression. Traditional therapy may not address the energetic and spiritual dimensions of these wounds. Users may be highly sensitive, empathic, or from families with generational trauma patterns that suppress emotional authenticity.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your inner child healing request and I will start the process,"" then idle for the user to provide their specific request.
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**

1. Spiritual Seekers: Breaking through emotional numbness to access deeper spiritual connection and intuitive gifts
2. Highly Sensitive People: Learning to navigate intense emotions while maintaining energetic boundaries and inner peace
3. Adult Children of Dysfunction: Healing generational trauma patterns and reclaiming authentic emotional expression

**Example User Input:**

""I feel disconnected from joy and my emotions feel frozen. I grew up in a family where showing feelings was seen as weakness, and now I struggle to access my heart even in meditation. Help me reconnect with my inner child and open my emotional body safely.""

I used to be no so active but managed to have an average body structure before moving here. The nightmare started after I decided to go for a week on a ""cultural discovery"" myself, trying various restaurants every day. Both lunch and dinner, with dessert as well, and between them had coffee again with some dessert. Then from that I got more into ordering food from home, and here we are today, with a BMI sitting at ""overweight"" (top of the range, almost obese). 

I'm now 6 months in on keto diet (no sugars) but this doesn't help at all since I've lost very little weight.  
I used to walk a lot outside in Europe, but it's not something I prefer to do in UAE (even tho I want to praise the business bay canal which is super walkable, business bay to Kite beach!)

1ksxavl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bollywoodcelebsreal/comments/1ksxavl/good_news_or_bad_news_on_set/,Good news or bad news on set,"Rhea’s Behind-the-Scenes Experience on the Set of Good News

So, Rhea recently got this super cool opportunity to work as a junior assistant on the film set of Good News—yup, the one with Akshay Kumar, Kareena Kapoor, Kiara Advani, and Diljit Dosanjh! She wasn’t doing anything major, just helping with managing the set space, keeping things organized, and running small errands for the crew.

One day during filming, while she was delivering coffee to one of the assistant directors, she accidentally bumped into Akshay Kumar—literally dropped the entire tray of coffee near him. Rhea was mortified, but Akshay just burst out laughing, helped her clean up, and even offered her one of the protein bars from his personal stash! He was cracking jokes with the crew the whole day and even asked Rhea if she wanted to try doing a stunt roll on the crash mat just for fun (she obviously said no, but it was hilarious).

Now, Kareena Kapoor? Totally different vibe. Rhea said Kareena barely acknowledged anyone on set, and once even rolled her eyes when Rhea offered her a bottle of water. She kept asking why things weren’t “on time” even when everything was on time. Super diva behavior.

As for Kiara Advani, she looked stunning as always, but barely spoke a word. She walked around with a team of assistants, had this aloof princess energy, and once ignored Rhea when she politely said “good morning.” Rhea joked that it felt like she was guarding the gates of royalty.

But Diljit Dosanjh? Absolute sweetheart. He smiled at everyone, complimented the spot boys on their tea-making skills, and even gave Rhea a fist bump when she helped untangle some of the mic wires. He had chill, good-vibes energy and kept humming tunes in between takes.

1ksxaoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1ksxaoz/is_a_lot_of_romance_and_dotting_normal_in_the/,Is a lot of romance and dotting normal in the beginning of something new?,"I (26F) recently starting seeing this guy (24M). We started out as friends always light heartedly joking around and teasing eachother. 

It was clear from pretty early on he liked me. It took me longer to start returning those feelings. 

Only recently (about two weeks) did we start talking more intimately. We went out on the weekend and hugged and he kissed my cheek. It made me happy.

But during this time he's been very very romantic and expressive of his feelings and hopes for the future. 

I have never had a guy be like this. He puts on so much effort to make things romantic and to go slow. I have no idea how 'normal' this is. 

All the guys I've ever went on dates with just want to grab coffee then chill and hang out. No asking to go on more official dates or anything even remotely romantic. Just immediately chilling around no real effort no romance really.

But this guy just died it all. It feels very nice but it definitely makes me anxious that it's all a facade. He doesn't seem the type to fake it. 

So I guess my question is. How normal is it for guys to actually be so romantic early on? Should I be concerned?

TLDR; just started seeing a guy that is extremely romantic. is it normal for men to be very romantic at the start of something new? ",1,1747936585.0,relationships_advice,1,1.0,False
1ksxa98,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewilddotty/comments/1ksxa98/auntie_kim_and_i_with_kenny/,Auntie Kim and I with Kenny.,"Kenny sat across the bar from me and I got him a beer. “Sorry I lied to you, Dotty, but I didn’t feel comfortable telling you about Auntie Kim. Hope you’re not angry with me.” Kenny told me.

“Not angry one bit, Kenny. I like Kim. She’s very easy to talk with. This weekend has really taken a turn hey? Good thing Dee couldn’t make it, or you’d be busier than a bee.” I said, winking at my young, nude neighbor.

Kim came from the bathroom and glided over to the bar. She still had on the short blue jean skirt. Her large, firm titties sitting high up on her tanned chest. She was smiling as she pressed up against Kenny. She put her arm around Kenny’s shoulder and kissed his cheek.

Kim gave a smiling, perky ‘Hi’ to me as she hopped up on the stool next to Kenny. “This is unreal, being here like this. I love the freedom of it. Never dreamed I’d be engaged in something like this. Thank you for sharing this with me. It’s exciting.” Kim joyfully committed.

I set up a drink for Kim. She eased back in the bar stool and crossed her long legs. She had this perpetual smile. She was swiveled in Kenny’s direction rubbing her toes on his leg.

Kenny reach over and squeezed Kim’s left tit then lowered his lips to the hard nipple. He sat back and Kim said, “You like Aunties big titties. How about Dotty’s?”

Kenny stood up and Kim chuckled, “Look at you. It’s only been minutes since we did it and you’re big and hard again. That astonishes me, but I sure do love that ability in my handsome step nephew.”

Kenny walked over and I smiled up at him. He leaned and kissed me while unbuttoning my sleeveless blouse. Kenny opened my blouse and cupped my large tits through my lavender lacy bra. My heart was raced wildly, as it always does when seeing his fat hardon.

Kenny took my hand and pulled me up from my seat, leading me over the long sofa. I felt myself blushing as I looked at Kim’s smiling face. 

Kenny removed my blouse dropping it on the glass coffee table. As he worked on undoing my shorts I removed my bra. Kenny crouched down pulling down my shorts and red thong.

Kenny reached around gripping my bare ass and kissed my muff, darting his tongue on my pussy. I held his head as I widened my stance to give his mouth full access to my throbbing, wet pussy.

“Oh! That feels so good honey. Let me stretch out ok, then you can continue.”I glanced over at Kenny’s Auntie Kim who had swiveled around in the bar stool to face the long, turquoise sofa. 

I got comfortable on the sofa and Kenny slid in between my tanned, bent open legs. He went back to eating me out, which I loved him doing to me before he fucks me senseless.

Kenny licked me into a shivering orgasm. He wasted no time in mounting me as soon as I came. Something we’ve done many times since I took up with him.

Kenny fucked me hard in the missionary position, I don’t know how many times I came. It seemed to never stop and had me gasping and yelping like a wolf at the moon.

Then he had me get on top, one of my fav position. Again I had multiple orgasms. I’ve never cum so much in my life as I have when letting this young man into my pants.

We finished up with Kenny’s favorite position, from behind. He loves smacking a soft, round ass, and his hard ponding filled the living room with plenty of loud smacks and me whaling from each deep thrust of young Kenny’s hard cock.

When Kenny gave me his cum, finally, I’m not complaining that his youthful stamina and self control fucks me so long, I love it, I got up from the sofa, snickered over at Kim, and trotted off to the bathroom.

When I returned to living room, Kim and Kenny at the bar, Kim laughing, I pulled on my thong and joined them, putting young Kenny between her and I this time.

Kim smiled over at me and gleefully says, “That was very interesting, Dotty. Very erotic and arousing. I loved seeing this. Thanks for the experience and allowing me to into your relationship with my young, handsome step nephew.”

Back in my first year of uni, I got really close to this girl. We were practically inseparable. Same classes, same routines—lunch together, coffee, studying, talking late at night. She became my best friend. No flirting, no romantic plans on my side, just a genuine connection. I hadn’t had anything like it before.

One night during one of our usual calls, she said, “I love you.”
And I said it back.
Not as a grand gesture—more like, “Yeah, of course I do, you’re my person.” I didn’t think it meant we were dating. I just thought that’s what close friends say when they really mean it.

I kept treating her like a best friend. I’d stand up for her, get a little protective sometimes, and yeah, maybe I felt weird when other guys got too close—but I chalked that up to friendship too. In hindsight… yeah. No, it wasn’t just friendship.

Then life kicked in. I picked up this exhausting job 12-hour shifts, every single day. It drained me completely. I stopped going to classes, barely texted anyone. I wasn’t trying to cut anyone off, I just didn’t have anything left in the tank. But she kept reaching out, checking on me, making the effort.

I didn’t really notice how much she was trying. Not until she stopped.

It’s been months now. No message, no calls. And now that I have some mental clarity again, I’m realizing: she probably thought we were in a relationship. And to be honest, she wasn’t wrong to think that. I just didn’t know enough to see it. I didn’t mean to ignore her or hurt her I just didn’t understand what we were.

And now I can’t help but feel like I accidentally broke someone’s heart by being completely clueless. It wasn’t malice. Just inexperience. Still feels bad though.",2,1747936514.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False

It’s taking longer than we hoped, but we’re on it, and we hear you loud and clear. We’re committed to getting it right and bringing the XL Flow Control Filter Cap to life as soon as we can.

1ksx90x,https://www.reddit.com/r/OvenMasters/comments/1ksx90x/does_the_roter_mond_st030_toaster_deliver_on/,Does the Roter Mond ST030 Toaster Deliver on Performance? Detailed Review,"Testing the **Roter Mond ST030 Countdown Stainless Steel 4 Slice Toaster** has been a delightful experience, but it’s definitely a product that comes with its share of nuances. From mornings filled with the aroma of perfectly toasted bagels to occasional frustrations over settings that puzzled even my tech-savvy partner, this toaster delivers plenty to talk about. Boasting a sleek stainless steel body, extra-wide slots, and LED countdown timer, this toaster caught my attention not just for its design but also for its range of functional features. Here's what I uncovered during my in-depth usage of this kitchen gadget.

**Design and Build Quality**  
One thing that immediately stands out is how premium the toaster feels. Its stainless-steel body doesn't just look modern and classy, it provides durability and effective heat resistance. Being someone who often multitasks in the kitchen, I appreciated that the body doesn't become scorching hot during use. The anti-slip base was a thoughtful touch that kept the toaster steady on my somewhat crowded countertop, even when I was in a rush.

**6 Browning Settings and Evenly Toasted Bread**  
The six browning settings were a lifesaver for my picky household. My daughter insists on light golden toast, while my sibling prefers a deep char. This toaster handled both preferences easily with its customizable knob. The browning was surprisingly even—I’ve used toasters before where one side comes out black while the other is barely toasted, but that wasn’t the case here.  

[Check Roter Mond ST030 price on Amazon.](https://chpizza.com/p/b0cssnjzsk/)  

**LED Countdown Timer and Ease of Use**  
One of the main reasons I wanted to try this toaster was the LED countdown timer. On mornings when I'm juggling coffee-making and getting the kids dressed, having a visual indicator of how much time is left is unexpectedly helpful. It reduced the frustration of waiting for the slices to pop up. The toaster’s buttons are simple and clearly labeled—no fumbling to figure out which function does what. Bonus points for the high lift carriage, which I didn’t even realize I needed until it effortlessly popped up smaller English muffins.

**Strengths**  
- Eye-catching stainless-steel design with an anti-slip base for stability.  
- LED countdown timer prevents over-toasting and saves time.  
- Impressive browning consistency across all settings.  

**Quick Cleaning Solution**  
The removable crumb tray is a thoughtful addition for convenience. After a week of morning toast runs, I pulled out the tray, gave it a quick rinse under the tap, and put it back in spotless condition. It took less than a minute, making cleanup less of a chore.

**Limitations**  
That said, this toaster isn't without faults. Here are some aspects I felt could use improvement:  
- The ""Bagel"" feature, while a handy addition, only toasts on the outside. Both sides toasting evenly would have been nicer.  
- LED timer display, though innovative, can get hard to read under bright kitchen lighting.  
- Takes slightly longer for defrosting frozen bread compared to other appliances I’ve tried.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing it with similar high-end toasters like the Breville or Cuisinart models, I’d say the Roter Mond excels in style and the practical countdown timer. However, features like dual-zone toasting in Breville’s lineup were missed here. Cuisinart’s faster defrosting mode is also superior. On the flip side, the Roter Mond is better priced and its robust construction makes it an excellent alternative.

**Worth Every Penny?**  
Evaluating its performance and durability against its cost, I’d say this toaster delivers impressive **quality for its price.** Sure, there are slightly faster or more feature-packed models on the market, but for everyday needs, this strikes a good balance between functionality and elegance. Plus, it’s not just a toaster—it’s an upgrade to your kitchen ambiance.

Location: Florida 


I used to work for a boba established(if you're not sure what boba is just think of it like a family owned coffee shop). I only worked there for 3 months. I wasn't hired like normal because I was friends with the owners. So a lot of things that would have normally be told/taught/shown to me wasn't always being done since they assumed I already knew(their words not mine). Everything was fine until the last 2 weeks I worked there. I started the work week, on Tuesday, normal with opening with the owners adult daughter and then I closed with the adult son. It was when the son got there that everything was off and he was just being a terrible boss/coworker towards me. The rest of the week was obviously not normal after that. Fast forward to Saturday and the parents(the owners) asked me if I wanted to talk to the adult kids about what happened since they thought there was some tension in our friendship. I assumed there wasn't anything wrong and maybe the son had an off day and that just made the rest of the week awkward so I agreed. So that Saturday the 5 of us sat down to talk. It was during my opening shift and the talk that I thought would be quick ended up being 4+ hours of the son and daughter accusing me of things I hadn't done.   (This next part is going to sound so childish and it is and I'm sorry ) The adult children were upset I was hanging out with our mutual friend, who they also hang out with, saying that the 2 of us were plotting against them, the kids, and the boba shop. The proceeded to say our friend was possessed by the devil and I'm letting Satan get a hold of me. They continued to accuse me of a long list of other things and nothing I said could change their minds.

The next day, Sunday, I went to serve in my church since I do that every weekend and one of the pastoral figures asks me why he received a text from the adult children about having a talk with him and his wife. Now something to note only I know his wife and the adult children knows who she is but doesn't know her personality. The wife has even said she has never had a conversation with them.  Now I didn't tell them anything except we had a 4+ hour conversation the day prior and they accused me of a lot of things that were untrue.

Now let's jump to the following Sunday and I'm given an incident report about the previous weeks 4+ hour conversation. The incident report is just stating issues they have with me. It took over an hour to go over it. In the start when the owners sat me down they started off saying ""You're not being fired we're just going over the incident that happened last week Saturday."" However in the end of that conversation I was told they had to let me go. They didn't give me a reason however they did mention that their adult children no longer wish to work with me. As well as saying that me calling out 2 times the last week because of my health (they knew I had a lot of medical/health issues before hiring me) that it was to much of a nuisance for them. They wished me luck and said if I needed a reference they'd gladly give me one.

I thought that was the end until I texted some mutual friends and they didn't answer. I ended up hearing things from others about stuff that was being said about me from the adult daughter. Last week I found out one if the things being said is I stole from them. Now I've never stolen a thing in my life so I was very shocked to hear that. Unfortunately I had bought concert tickets months ago with the adult children before I was every fired and I had to go to the Boba shop to sort out the tickets. I really thought since they started all this that they would reach out but I was wrong. So I went this past Tuesday and while I was there ticketmaster wasn't working so I ended up staying longer than I had hoped. So I ended up asking why they were telling people I stole from them when it wasn't true. They told me that I didn't know the full story and that I stole money from them. They then preceeded to tell me that I stole money from them because I knew the cameras weren't working (I didn't know that) and that I had planned this all out. They said it happened in the last 2 weeks I was working there.


So like my title says I would like to sue for wrongful termination and defamation of character. I dont know anything about suing a person/business. I also don't have much money as I'm in my early 20s. I am also aware that Florida is an at-will state so it's hard to sue for wrongful termination but I do believe I have a solid case. I'm currently in the process of writing a cease and desist letter but knowing them I know they won't so that's why I'm looking for a lawyer as well.
Please give me any advice you have, I'd greatly appreciate it. Sorry if what I said/explained wasn't clear. I tried to make it as short as possible while also getting the gist across. I'm more than happy to elaborate on anything or answer questions if you're confused.",1,1747936460.0,legaladvice,6,1.0,False

1ksx83t,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldsBestSupplements/comments/1ksx83t/natural_energy_supplements_that_actually_work/,Natural Energy Supplements That Actually Work (Without Caffeine or Stimulants)*,"# Why Go Caffeine-Free for an Energy Boost?

All around the world, Caffeine seems to be the go-to for a quick energy fix, but it's not for everyone or for all the time. Many people who take caffeine can experience unwanted side effects such as ""the jitters"", heightened anxiety, energy crashes (defeating the initial purpose in the first place), or even sleep disruptions. And once you go about disrupting your sleep cycle, or the quality of your sleep, you potentially kick off a vicious cycle of waking up feeling drained, then turning towards caffeine to get energy, and so on.

Whether your goal is to manage what is known as Adrenal Fatigue, or simply trying to cut back on caffeine and other stimulants, but still need a clean source for additional energy throughout the day, let's explore some alternative ingredients.

# Top Natural Energy Supplements That Work Without Caffeine

In no particular order...

1. [L-Carnitine](https://worldsbestsupplements.com/products/skinny-drops-1-oz): This amino acid transports fatty acid into your body's cells, where it is used as energy. L-Carnitine can be especially useful for supporting energy levels during exercise, increasing fat metabolism, as well as enhancing brain function through increased energy.
2. [CoQ10](https://worldsbestsupplements.com/products/coq10-ubiquinone-200mg-30-caps): CoQ10 is an essential enzyme for cellular energy production in the mitochondria. As we age, natural levels of CoQ10 typical diminish, leaving us with lower available energy without supplementation. If you are over the age of 40, CoQ10 levels may be especially low.
3. [B-Vitamin Complex](https://worldsbestsupplements.com/products/b-12-energy-strips-1000mcg-cranberry-30-count): B Vitamins (B-12 in particular) help convert the foods we eat into usable energy, as well as help support our nervous system function. Supplementing your B-Vitamin levels may help reduce fatigue, and support favorable stress response.
4. [Cordyceps Mushroom](https://worldsbestsupplements.com/products/cordyceps-mushroom-1000mg-60-capsules): Cordyceps are an adaptogenic fungus that help increase ATP production, which is the special molecule our cells use for energy and function. Cordyceps mushroom supplements may help improve endurance, stamina, and increase oxygen utilization in the cells.
5. [L-Tyrosine](https://worldsbestsupplements.com/products/thermogenic-fat-burner-90-capsules): L-Tyrosine helps support dopamine production which may improve mental alertness, mood and motivation, without being over-stimulating.

# What to Avoid in ""Natural"" Energy Supplements to Steer Clear of Caffeine

Just because something claims it's ""natural"", doesn't mean that it's automatically good for you. Afterall, if you're trying to avoid caffeine, it generally comes from natural sources too. So here are some ingredients and other potential red flags on what to look out for on the label:

* Hidden caffeine from natural sources such as Guarana, Yerba Mate, or Green Tea Extract
* ""Proprietary Blends"" that don't list out their individual ingredients. Not all proprietary blends are a bad thing, but if they can't disclose what's in it, you may need to assume the worst case scenario
* Artificial sweeteners and artificial colors. Artificial sweeteners doesn't mean ""everything except sugar"", there are plenty of natural sweeteners out there that are not sugar, such as erythritol, stevia, xylitol, and more. Some of the bad ones to look out for are things like Maltodextrin, Aspartame, Sucralose, Saccharin, Maltitol, Sorbitol, etc. Though some people still experience gastric upset with natural sweeteners like Xylitol and Erythritol, so if you experience issues just make note and steer clear in the future.
* Other unnecessary stimulants that spike and crash energy, this can be Yohimbine, DMAA, Bitter Orange (Synephrine), etc.

# Best Times of the Day to take Your Caffeine-Free Energy Supplements

While it may be tempting to wake up and take a handful of dietary supplements first thing in the morning to get them done and out of the way, some of them may provide you a better benefit when taken at various times throughout the day. So let's break down some suggestions:

* **Morning:** This is when it's ideal to take your Vitamin-B Complex (a blend of various Vitamin B sources) as well as Rhodiola Rosea.
* **Mid-Day:** Reach for the CoQ10 and/or the Cordyceps Mushroom supplements.
* **Pre-Workout:** Some amino acids like L-Carnitine can help during workouts, as well as good electrolytes.
* **Focus Support:** N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine can be good for busting through that ""brain fog"" and giving you a sense of improved mental focus and clarity.
* **Night Time:** No, just don't, unless you work a 3rd Shift like ""Graveyard"" in which case adjust the recommended timings based on what you sleep schedule is like. Otherwise, seriously why are you trying to get amped up right before bed?

# You Don't Need Caffeine to Feel Energized

Natural energy doesn't always have to come in the form of coffee, tea, or gas station energy drinks. By choosing clean, effective ingredients that work WITH your body, instead of AGAINST it, you can power through your day with more stable, sustained energy and no crash. Ditch the jitters and boost your vitality!

Final Part,"*I found one of Dad’s old flannel shirts today. The green one with the ripped cuff he always wore when working on the truck.*

*It still smelled like him.*

*I sat in the garage holding it for almost an hour. Just breathing.*

*And then I looked up at the ceiling… and I could feel the attic above me.*

*I need to keep going. I need to get through it.*

*Thursday. 2003*

I came into the kitchen around 7:45AM, my cast already starting to itch and the whole left side of my body sore like I’d gone ten rounds with a semi-truck.

The sun was shining through the curtains, warm and golden, like nothing was wrong. Like nothing had ever happened.

Mom was at the stove, poking at eggs she clearly didn’t want to eat. Her hair was pulled into a low, messy bun, and she had that *tight smile* on her face. The one she wore when things were bad, but she didn’t want me to know they were bad.

Dad sat at the table, already showered and dressed, black coffee in front of him. His work boots were beside his chair, unlaced. He hadn’t touched his toast.

Tori sat across from him, pushing a spoon through a bowl of cereal and scowling like we’d personally ruined her life.

“Hey, kiddo,” Mom said when she saw me. “Hungry?”

I shrugged. “Not really.”

I slid into the chair beside Dad and winced as I bumped my cast against the table.

He glanced over, then reached out and gently adjusted my plate so I wouldn’t have to move it.

“How’s the wrist?” he asked.

“Sore.”

He nodded. “Doctor says it’s a clean break. You’re lucky.”

I didn’t feel lucky.

I felt like something had reached out of the dark and tried to pull me back in.

Tori let out a loud sigh and crossed her arms. “So what—he just gets to stay home all week now?”

Mom shot her a look. “Victoria.”

“What? I’m just saying—*some* of us have finals next week.”

Dad sipped his coffee. “The doctor gave him a note for the rest of the week.”

Tori rolled her eyes. “Of course he did.”

“He has a broken arm,” Mom said, her voice thin.

“And a head full of ghosts,” Tori mumbled under her breath.

“What was that?” Dad asked, his voice sharp.

“Nothing,” she said, but she didn’t look at me. Just stared at her spoon like it had personally offended her.

Dad sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. “I have to go back in today. I told Jim I’d cover the shop until at least Friday.”

Mom nodded quietly.

“We can’t leave him here alone,” Dad added. “Not with his arm like that.”

“I’ll stay,” Mom said. “I’ll call out.”

“No.” He shook his head. “You’ve already missed two shifts. I called Mom this morning. She’s gonna come over and sit with him today.”

I froze.

“Grandma?” I asked, trying not to sound *too* twelve about it.

“She’ll be here by ten,” Dad said, like that was the end of it.

I looked at Mom, hoping she might object—but she didn’t. She just smiled, soft and sad. “You’ll like the company. She’ll probably bring muffins.”

Tori snorted.

I just stared down at my plate, appetite gone.

I didn’t want muffins.

I wanted someone to believe me.

After everyone left, the house went quiet.

I watched through the front window as Dad backed the truck out of the driveway, Mom in the passenger seat, Tori slouched in the back. She gave me one last dramatic look before disappearing behind the glare of the window glass.

I listened to the garage door groan shut.

Then silence.

Just me.

I turned on the TV in the living room and laid down on the couch, cast resting on a pillow. The cartoons were bright and loud, but they didn’t do much to quiet the rest of the house. The attic was still up there. Still waiting.

I glanced at the clock. Grandma wasn’t supposed to be there for another hour and a half.

I’d just started zoning out to *Pokemon* reruns when—

*Knock knock knock.*

Three quick knocks at the front door.

I sat up fast, heart racing.

Not because I was scared, but because *no one* ever knocked that early unless it was a delivery or something bad.

I peeked through the peephole.

Three kids stood on the porch.

Zack, Taylor, and Blake.

My friends.

Well—sort of.

We ate lunch together, played *Super Smash Bros.* whenever someone had a sleepover, and texted more than we actually talked in class. They weren’t the most popular kids, but neither was I.

Zack had a backpack slung over one shoulder and was holding a manila folder. Blake stood with his hands in his hoodie pockets, his hair a mess like he barely made it out of bed. And Taylor—short, sharp-eyed, in a jean jacket way too big for her—had a Yoo-hoo in one hand and a silver pack of Pop-Tarts in the other.

I opened the door with my good hand.

“Duuude,” Taylor said, eyebrows raising as she looked at my cast. “You actually broke it?”

“No way,” Blake muttered, leaning closer like he was gonna poke it. “You fell out of the *attic*?”

“Yeah,” I said, stepping aside. “You guys wanna come in?”

They didn’t need a second invitation.

They crashed into the living room like we did every Saturday. Zack handed me the folder.

“Ms. C said to give you your makeup work,” he said. “We told her we’d stop by before school.”

“And my mom only said yes ‘cause I told her you were *tragically injured,*” Taylor added, tossing the extra Pop-Tarts she had in her backpack onto my lap. “Strawberry. You’re welcome.”

I sat down and pulled my blanket over my legs.

“Thanks, guys. Seriously.”

“Did it hurt?” Blake asked, flopping into the recliner. “Falling, I mean?”

“Yeah.”

“Like a lot?”

“Like someone tried to rip my arm off.”

Taylor let out a low, long whistle. “Metal.”

Zack gave her a look. “He could’ve died.”

“Still metal,” she shrugged, cracking open her Yoo-hoo.

Then Zack tilted his head. “Wait… why were you even up there?”

I hesitated.

I looked at them—all three.

They weren’t jerks. They weren’t like the kids who whispered about me in the hallway. And they’d come all this way, early, before school, just to check on me.

So, I told them.

Everything.

About Mollie barking at the walls. About the noises in the attic at night. About sneaking up there with my lightsaber, and the nest. The scratching. The shape in the dark. The fall. The hand. The attic door *slamming shut on its own.*

Their faces changed.

Taylor sat forward slowly; Pop-Tart half-crushed in her hand now.

Zack didn’t blink.

And Blake said, softly, “Dude… what the hell?”

“You think something’s living up there?” Taylor asked, eyes darting toward the ceiling.

“I don’t think,” I said. “I *know*.”

“It chased you?” Zack asked. “Like—*actually* chased you?”

I nodded.

“I heard it breathe,” I whispered.

They all looked up at once.

The attic was directly above the living room.

And the house suddenly felt smaller. Quieter. Like we’d said something out loud we weren’t supposed to. 

For a long time, nobody spoke.

Then Blake whispered, “What if it’s listening?”

“Don’t say that,” Taylor said, smacking his arm.

“No, seriously.” Blake shifted nervously in his seat. “What if it knows you’re home alone right now?”

“Okay, you’re freaking yourself out,” Zack said. But his eyes hadn’t left the ceiling.

A faint creak echoed from somewhere upstairs.

All three of them jumped.

I clenched my blanket in one hand. “It does that a lot. Usually at night. Sometimes it… moves around.”

Zack stood and grabbed his backpack. “We should go.”

“Dude, come on,” Taylor said. “You’re not gonna leave him here alone with that thing crawling around the attic.”

“We have school,” he said, but his voice was shaking now. “And it’s not like we can do anything about it in the middle of the day.”

Taylor looked over at me.

I could see it in her face. She wanted to help. She just didn’t know how.

“Let’s come back after school,” she said suddenly. “Like, tonight. I’ll ask my mom if I can stay over.”

“Me too,” Blake said. “I’ll tell my dad I’m staying at Zack’s.”

“Why my house?” Zack asked.

“Because you’re boring and trustworthy,” Taylor shot back. “And we’re gonna need someone to bring snacks.”

Zack rolled his eyes but didn’t argue.

I nodded slowly. “Okay. Yeah. Tonight.”

“We’ll bring flashlights,” Blake said. “And, like… salt. Isn’t that a thing?”

“Only if you’re fighting ghosts,” Taylor muttered. “This thing’s not a ghost. It’s something *else.*”

“Okay, well… what *is* it then?”

We all looked at each other.

No one had an answer.

Then—

BANG. BANG. BANG.

We all screamed.

Taylor nearly dropped her Yoo-hoo.

“WHO’S READY FOR MUFFINS?” a voice called through the front door.

“Oh my god,” Blake gasped, clutching his chest. “I’m gonna piss.”

“It’s just my grandma,” I muttered, stumbling to my feet.

I opened the door and there she was: Grandma. Gray sweater. Big smile. A basket of muffins in one hand, an off-brand orange juice jug in the other.

“Oh! I didn’t know you had company!” she beamed.

Taylor stood, adjusting her oversized jacket. “We were just leaving. School. You know.”

“Uh-huh,” Grandma said, eyeing the three of them with that warm, old-lady suspicion that could melt concrete. “Well, I’ll keep an eye on our patient here. Don’t worry.”

Zack cleared his throat. “See you later.”

“After school,” Taylor whispered to me as she passed.

Then she was gone.

All three of them, heading back down the porch and across the lawn, glancing over their shoulders like the house might try to follow.

Grandma shut the door behind them and turned to me, her smile softening.

“You look pale,” she said. “Want to sit with me while I knit? Or would you rather go lay down?”

I stared up at the ceiling.

At the attic.

“I think I’m good right here,” I said quietly.

Grandma made me a grilled cheese and tomato soup and insisted I eat every bite, even though I wasn’t hungry.

She didn’t ask a lot of questions. Just hovered, smiling gently, pouring me juice, tucking the blanket around my legs again even after I kicked it off. She had that quiet, steady kind of love that made you feel guilty for keeping secrets.

After lunch, she flipped through the channels until she landed on a soap opera—something about twins and betrayal and a baby that might be cursed—then settled into the recliner with her knitting needles clacking softly in her lap.

By the time the second commercial break hit, she was out cold. Head tilted, mouth slightly open, one hand still tangled in blue yarn.

The house was quiet again.

Except for the TV.

I left it on and padded down the hall. My wrist still ached, but the pills from the hospital were finally working. I just needed to pee and splash some water on my face.

I pushed open the bathroom door with my good hand and stepped inside.

The door swung closed behind me.

Click.

I turned the faucet on. Let the water run.

And then—

Footsteps.

Fast.

*Slapping* across the hardwood floor outside.

I spun around.

Something hit the bathroom door.

Hard.

The whole thing shuddered on its hinges.

I backed up.

My heart was racing now, pounding in my ears.

Then—

A hand curled around the edge of the door.

Long fingers. Grayish skin. Black, cracked nails.

It gripped the doorframe like it was trying to keep me in.

“No no no—” I whispered, shoving against the door.

It didn’t move.

I pressed my back to the wall, eyes darting around the room, breath catching in my throat.

That’s when I heard it.

A low, rattling breath.

Not from the other side of the door.

From above.

I looked up—slowly.

The vent above the toilet was rattling slightly, the metal slats twitching like something was pressing against them from the inside.

A soft scrape echoed through the vent.

Then a finger.

Then another.

It was crawling out.

The vent cover popped loose with a soft *ping*, clattering to the floor.

Something slid through.

Long limbs. Pale skin. Elbows that bent the wrong way.

It dropped into the bathtub behind the shower curtain with a heavy *thump*.

I couldn’t move.

The room was dead quiet.

Except for the sound of it breathing behind the curtain.

Each breath made the plastic suck in, then puff out again.  
Suck in—puff out.

I could see the shape of it now, faint and twisted behind the floral print.

Then the curtain moved.

Just slightly.

Just enough.

Like it was leaning closer.

I opened my mouth to scream—

The door yanked open.

Light flooded in.

The hallway. Grandma’s voice, faint: “Sweetheart?”

I ran.

Out of the bathroom, past her, down the hall, gasping, heart hammering like it was going to crack through my ribs.

She followed, confused, knitting still wrapped around her wrist.

“What happened?” she called after me. “Are you okay? 

Grandma hurried in behind me, a mess of yarn still tangled around her wrist. “What on earth—? What happened?”

I couldn’t speak at first. My chest was tight. My wrist throbbed. My heart was doing somersaults.

She crouched down beside me, one hand on my shoulder. “Was it your arm again? Did something—?”

“It was in the bathroom,” I whispered.

Her brow furrowed.

“What was, sweetheart?”

“*It.*” I pointed down the hallway. “It grabbed the door. It came through the vent. It dropped into the tub—I saw it. I *heard*it.”

She stood slowly, eyes narrowing just a little.

“I’ll go check.”

“No—don’t—”

But she was already walking. She walked to the kitchen and pulled a large knife from the knife block.

I watched her disappear down the hall, every second stretching out like rubber. I thought maybe I’d hear her scream. Or call for help. Or say something *anything*—

But when she came back, she just shook her head.

“There’s nothing there,” she said gently. “No handprints, no vent cover on the floor, no mess in the tub.”

My stomach twisted.

“That’s not possible,” I said.

Her smile didn’t reach her eyes. “I think you might’ve dozed off and had a nightmare.”

“I was *awake.*”

She didn’t argue.

She just picked up her knitting and settled back into the recliner.

The house stayed quiet for the rest of the afternoon. Too quiet.

By the time my parents got home, I was already standing at the foot of the stairs, waiting for them.

Dad looked exhausted. His eyes were bloodshot, and his uniform shirt had a grease stain down the front.

“You’re still up?” he asked, tossing his keys into the bowl on the side table.

“I need to ask you something.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Yeah?”

I hesitated. Then said, “Can Zack, Taylor, and Blake come over?”

Dad blinked. “Tonight?”

“Just for a little while. Maybe a sleepover. Nothing big.”

He glanced at Mom, who looked at me with that tired mom-face that says *not tonight,* but also *we feel bad for you.*

“I don’t know, bud,” Dad said. “You’re still healing. And I’m beat.”

“They already asked their parents,” I lied quickly. “They’re bringing flashlights and movies. It’s just to hang out. I swear.”

He rubbed his temples. “You sure you’re up for that? After the hospital and—everything?”

I nodded, trying to keep my voice steady. “Yeah. I just… don’t want to be alone tonight.”

Something in that hit him. He didn’t say anything for a moment.

Then he sighed and reached for his phone. “Tell them to be here by nine. Quiet night. No roughhousing.”

I nodded again. “Yes. Thank you.”

He headed for the kitchen. “And don’t go back in the attic. I mean it.”

“I won’t,” I said.

That was a lie too. 

The doorbell rang at 8:47PM.

Blake was the first one through the door, backpack half unzipped, his hoodie sleeves pulled over his hands. “Yo,” he grinned, like we hadn’t just seen each other earlier that morning.

Taylor came in next, wearing flannel pajama pants with little bats on them and carrying a flashlight the size of a baseball bat. “We come bearing snacks and questionable judgment.”

Zack followed with a tote bag full of supplies—flashlights, batteries, two packs of Oreos, and a sketchpad covered in doodles. “My mom gave us Capri Suns, but Taylor chugged most of them in the car.”

I laughed—actually laughed—and stepped back to let them all in.

Then Tori came down the stairs in her tank top and pajama shorts, holding her phone and looking *thoroughly unimpressed*.

Blake froze halfway through dropping his backpack.

“...Hey,” he said, all casual-like, but his voice cracked halfway through it.

Tori raised one eyebrow. “Hey.”

She looked at me. “If these dorks eat all the pringles…”

“Don’t worry,” I said. “We have our own snacks” 

Blake turned to me, “is she going to join us?!” 

 “She’s not invited.”

She rolled her eyes and started walking toward the kitchen. Blake stared after her like she was the sun and he was an unsupervised moth.

“Is she staying home tonight?” he whispered.

“She *lives* here,” Taylor said. “Stop being weird.”

“I’m not being weird,” Blake muttered.

“You literally *stared at her forehead* like it had the answers to the universe.”

“I didn’t—”

“She’s too old for you, Blake,” Zack said, dropping the tote bag with a thud.

“Age is just a number,” Blake replied.

“And restraining orders are just paperwork,” Taylor deadpanned.

We moved into the living room and laid everything out: sleeping bags, pillows, snacks, the flashlight arsenal. I put on *Tremors*—Blake’s pick—because he claimed it was “educational” for people dealing with underground monsters.

Taylor was already halfway into the Oreos, and Zack was organizing the batteries like we were about to defuse a bomb.

It felt normal. For a little while.

The monster didn’t feel so close.

We laughed too loud. The movie jumped a couple times because our DVD player was scratched, and Blake kept yelling “THIS IS FORESHADOWING” every time Kevin Bacon did anything brave.

But under it all, we were waiting.  
Waiting for the house to go quiet.

Waiting for the lights to go out.  
For my parents to retreat upstairs.

At around 10:40PM, they finally did.

We heard Mom’s voice say, “Please don’t stay up all night,” and then Dad’s muttered “They better not wreck the furniture.”

Footsteps on the stairs.

The creak of the bedroom door.

Silence.

Taylor muted the movie.

We all looked at each other.

Zack was the first to speak. “So… we doing this?”

Taylor nodded. “I say we check the attic. All of us. Flashlights, snacks, slingshot—”

“I forgot the salt,” Blake said.

“No one asked for salt,” she hissed.

“I’m just saying, if it *is* a ghost, we’re unprotected.”

“It’s not a ghost,” I whispered. “It’s something else. Something that breathes and moves and *hurts* things.”

Everyone went quiet.

“I want to know what it is,” I said. “I need to know.”

Zack sat forward. “Then we make a plan. In and out. If anything feels off, we *leave*. No hero stuff.”

Blake nodded, clutching his flashlight like a sword.

Taylor grinned and cracked her knuckles. “Monster-hunting club begins tonight.”

We turned off the movie.

And started getting ready.

We stood in the hallway beneath the attic hatch, flashlights in hand, all four of us staring up at the square in the ceiling like it might blink.

The pull string was gone.

Blake tapped the ceiling with a plastic Wiffle bat he’d brought for “backup,” as if the attic might just open for effort. It didn’t.

“So…” he whispered, “do we have a plan? Or are we just standing here until the attic gets bored and eats us?”

“I’ve got it,” Taylor said, stepping back and dragging over a folding step stool she’d pulled from the laundry room. She thudded it into place beneath the hatch, climbed up two steps, and squinted at the latch. “It’s a little out of reach. I need something to pop it open.”

Blake held out a ruler with duct tape wrapped around the tip. “Custom made.”

Taylor blinked. “Why do you *have* that?”

“For science.”

Zack just shook his head and held up the metal rod from a broken curtain they found in the garage. “Try this instead.”

Taylor smirked. “Much better.”

She stretched on the top step, flashlight clamped under her arm, and jabbed the rod upward. It took a few tries, but finally—click.

The latch gave.

The attic door didn’t fall open fast—it creaked down slow, groaning the way old wood does in scary movies, until the opening yawned above us.

We all stared at the darkness inside.

“I am regretting this,” Blake whispered.

“You regret everything,” Zack said.

“I regret *being friends with you,*” Blake shot back.

I stepped forward with my cast cradled close. “I’ll hold the ladder steady. When you all get up there you can pull me up.”

“I got it,” Taylor said. “I’ll go first.”

Just as she grabbed the top rung of the attic ladder—

“What the hell are you doing?”

We all jumped.

Blake actually gasped. Zack swore under his breath.

Tori stood at the end of the hallway, holding a half-eaten Pop-Tart in one hand and looking like she’d caught us trying to summon the devil.

“Seriously?” she said, eyeing the gear. “This is your plan?”

“I told you to stay in your room,” I muttered.

Tori ignored me. “You’re going up there now? With a broken arm, a ruler, and *Blake*?”

“I brought a foam sword too,” Blake added helpfully.

“I rest my case.”

Taylor gave her a slow blink. “You coming over here just to roast us or…?”

Tori stared up at the attic, her face hard to read.

Then, without another word, she walked over, took the flashlight from Zack’s hand, and stepped beside the ladder.

She didn’t look at me. Just stared into the black square above.

“Mollie was my dog too.”

The hallway went quiet.

Blake blinked at her like she’d just confessed a crush. Taylor actually looked impressed. And Zack—Zack didn’t say a word. He just adjusted the flashlight beam.

Tori stepped up beside Taylor.

“We going,” she said, “or are we gonna stand here all night waiting to pee our pants?”

The attic creaked as we climbed in one by one.

Taylor went first, her flashlight cutting a shaky beam across the dust-heavy air. Blake followed, muttering “nope, nope, nope” under his breath the entire time. Zack climbed behind him, trying to pretend he wasn’t breathing fast. I was last, hoisting myself up one-handed while Tori reached down and helped steady me with surprising care.

The air was warmer than it should’ve been—thick, almost humid. It smelled like insulation and mildew and something *sweet* underneath, like rotting fruit or meat left out too long.

“Ugh, it smells like someone microwaved a diaper,” Blake whispered, holding his shirt over his nose.

“No one light a match,” Zack said. “The air up here might be flammable.”

We all stood together under the low, angled ceiling. The old Christmas boxes were still stacked near the wall. The fan blades Dad took down three summers ago were still leaning in the corner.

But the nest—

The thing I saw two nights ago, made of insulation and shredded blankets and god-knows-what else—

Was gone.

“Wait,” I said, spinning slowly in a circle. “Wait, no. No, it was *right here.*”

I stepped toward the far corner, flashlight shaking.

“There was a nest,” I said. “It was—like, something had made it. It was here. It chased me *from right here.*”

Tori walked beside me, scanning the floor with her light. “There’s nothing. You sure it wasn’t another part of the attic?”

“I’m *sure.* I swear it—”

And then—

The attic breathed.

Or maybe it *exhaled.*

A long, low sound, like something massive shifting in the rafters.

My flashlight flickered.

I turned fast. “Did you hear that?”

“Hear what?” Zack whispered.

“I don’t know but maybe we need to leave,” Blake said. “Right now. No notes, no souvenirs—just vibes and trauma, let’s *go—*”

It moved.

A shape. A blur. Something behind the beams. It darted, fast and low, and *no one else reacted.*

Only me.

“*It’s here—*” I yelled.

No one answered.

“*GUYS, IT’S HERE—*”

The light flared, and then—

It lunged.

I didn’t see its face.

Just claws.

Long, black claws raked across the floor as it tore forward. The shadows swallowed it and spat it back out like smoke. I saw it leap—too fast, too tall—and I shoved Zack sideways as it crashed through where he’d been standing.

“WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!” he yelled.

I didn’t answer.

“WE HAVE TO GO!” I screamed.

I ran.

Back toward the hatch.

Back toward the edge of the attic.

But the ladder wasn’t there anymore. Someone had pulled it up behind us.

And that’s when the thing roared—low and wrong and wet.

It charged.

I turned to the only other way out: the window.

A tiny square, just big enough to fit through.

“Tori!” I shouted. “The window!”

I got there first, yanking it open with a grunt. Taylor was already behind me, kicking the crate under it into place.

We climbed out one by one, onto the slanted roof just above the back porch.

The night air hit me like a punch. Cold. Wet. The stars overhead blurred by my tears and panic.

Blake slipped on the shingles and screamed. Taylor grabbed him.

Zack looked at me wildly, “what are you doing!? Stop!”

Tori was last.

But as she turned to climb through—

The thing reached out.

A clawed hand swiped out of the darkness, slashing toward her back. She twisted just in time, swinging the flashlight like a weapon and connecting with a sickening *CRACK.*

“GO!” she shouted.

But it grabbed her ankle.

She kicked. Screamed.

Zack reached for her.

The roof groaned.

She *almost* made it.

And then—

The shingle beneath her foot slipped.

And she fell.

I watched her tumble backward into the darkness below, her scream trailing off as her body disappeared from sight.

Then silence.

Just our breath. The hum of the night. The wind.

And the open window behind us.

Still breathing.

We stood on the roof for what felt like forever.

No one said anything.

The wind moved through the trees below. Porch lights from the neighbors cast long shadows on the lawn. And somewhere out there—Tori.

She wasn’t screaming anymore.

“Come on,” I said, scrambling toward the edge. “We have to find her—”

Zack grabbed my good arm. “Careful.”

Blake looked like he might throw up. His flashlight was shaking so bad the beam was bouncing off the trees.

Taylor was already climbing down the drainpipe mumbling as she went, “why did you do that?!” 

We followed.

By the time we reached the ground, we found her crumpled near the base of the hedges—face scratched, one shoe missing, her left leg bent wrong.

She was breathing.

Barely.

Her eyes fluttered open for a second. She saw me.

Then closed them again... 

The ambulance came fast.

Too fast.

Blue lights lit up our front yard while neighbors peeked through their blinds. My parents ran outside barefoot. My mom screamed when she saw Tori on the stretcher.

The paramedics asked questions. Zack answered most of them. Taylor barely spoke. Blake cried once, then pretended he wasn’t.

No one asked me anything.

No one looked at me.

Later, inside, the four of us sat in the living room, scattered across the floor like broken puzzle pieces.

The popcorn bowl had spilled during the panic. One of the sleeping bags was still half-zipped. The *Tremors* DVD menu looped quietly on the TV screen.

I hugged my knees, cast pressed to my chest, and stared at the carpet.

“I saw it,” I whispered. “It *grabbed her.* It pulled her back.”

No one said anything.

Taylor sat with her back to the couch, arms crossed, face hard. Her ponytail was messed up, and her sleeve had blood on it.

Zack didn’t even look at me.

“She wouldn’t have gone up there,” he said flatly, “if it weren’t for you.”

That hit harder than I thought it would.

“I didn’t make her go,” I said. “She *wanted* to. She said—”

“Yeah,” Taylor cut in, “she said ‘Mollie was my dog too.’ Because she felt *bad* for you.”

Blake sniffled from the recliner. “You said we’d just look. You said it wasn’t going to *do* anything.”

“I didn’t *know* it would attack,” I snapped. “I didn’t know it would—”

“It’s all in your head, man,” Zack said. “There was nothing there.”

“There *was!*” I shouted, louder than I meant to. “I saw it. It chased us. It grabbed her ankle.”

Silence.

Taylor finally looked at me.

But not like she believed me.

Like she was looking at someone she *used* to know.

“You’re the only one who ever sees it,” she said. “That’s kinda weird, don’t you think?”

I didn’t have an answer.

Taylor looked down to the floor, “nothing grabbed her…we all saw what happened…you pushed her.”

I looked down at the carpet, suddenly aware of how loud my breathing was.

Outside, the ambulance was gone.

So was Tori.

The front door creaked open.

Mom stepped in first, her face pale like a ghost. Behind her came Dad, still in his pajamas, hair windblown, eyes heavy with something worse than anger.

The kind of look you give someone when you don’t recognize them anymore.

“Get your stuff,” Mom said to the others.

No one said a word.

Taylor. Zack. Blake. They just moved. Silent. Tired. Like kids leaving a funeral.

I didn’t expect a goodbye, but it still hurt when I didn’t get one.

Mom ushered them out without looking back. Then the door closed.

Just me and Dad now.

The house groaned softly in the quiet. The movie menu still looped on the TV—“Play,” “Scene Select,” “Special Features.” The last time anything felt normal.

Dad walked over to the couch and sat down slowly. He looked like he’d aged ten years in one night.

I didn’t move from the floor.

He rubbed his face with both hands, then looked at me.

“I just got off the phone with the hospital,” he said, voice raw. “Tori’s stable. Banged up bad. But she’s gonna be okay.”

I let out a breath I didn’t know I’d been holding.

He nodded to himself. Then leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees.

There was a long silence.

Then he said, “Your friends… they told us what happened.”

I looked away.

“They said it was your idea. That you made them go up there. That you were the only one who saw anything.”

I said nothing.

“But I believe you think it’s real,” he added, softly. “I do.”

My throat burned.

“It *is* real,” I whispered.

He didn’t answer.

Instead, he let out a shaky breath and said, “There’s something I haven’t told you.”

That made me look up.

He wasn’t meeting my eyes. Just staring at the floor.

“The night Mollie died…” he started, voice slow, like the words were too heavy to push out. “I told your mom I found her in the attic. I told you she must’ve gotten into poison.”

I nodded. “You said she was already gone.”

“She was. But it wasn’t poison.”

He finally looked at me.

“When I found you up there… there wasn’t any rat bait. No spilled box. No teeth marks.”

He swallowed hard.

“There was just a hammer. Covered in blood. And your hands—your shirt—*you* were covered too.”

I froze.

A strange ringing filled my ears.

“I thought… maybe she’d already been hurt. Maybe you’d found her like that and tried to help. Maybe you grabbed the hammer because you were scared. I *wanted* to believe that. You had tried to soak up her blood with your blanket but…”

“Dad…”

“But now—after Tori, after the attic, after tonight…” He trailed off.

I stared at him, my pulse thudding like thunder in my ears.

“I think we need to go back,” he said quietly. “Back to the neurologist. Back to Dr. Kim.”

I shook my head.

“You remember what she said when you were five,” he continued. “After the surgery. About the scar tissue? That if anything changed, if the headaches came back, if you started… seeing things—”

“I’m *not* seeing things,” I snapped.

He didn’t argue.

He just said, “I don’t think this is your fault. But I think something’s wrong. Something we can’t see.”

I stood up, fists clenched.

“You think I hurt Mollie?”

“I think something hurt you,” he said. “And I don’t know how to fix it.”

My chest felt tight.

My cast itched like fire.

“You didn’t see it,” I whispered. “You never see it.”

He stood, slower than me. Careful.

“I see *you.* And that’s enough to scare the hell out of me.”

 

Mom stayed at the hospital with Tori.

Dad made a bed on the couch, but I knew he wasn’t sleeping. I could hear him tossing. Getting up. Sitting back down. Every hour or so, he’d check on me through the crack in my bedroom door.

He didn’t trust me anymore.

And maybe he was right.

But I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

The creature. The attic. The way no one else had seen it. The hammer. The blood. The *thing* inside the wall breathing.

If it was in my head… then why did everything feel so real?

Around 3AM, I couldn’t take it anymore.

I grabbed my plastic lightsaber, flicked the red blade to life, and crouched beside the wall in my room where I first heard the noise. 

The plaster felt cold under my fingers. Hollow.

I grabbed the old metal bat from under my bed.

And I started swinging.

CRACK.  
CRACK.

Drywall split apart. Chunks of insulation spilled onto the floor like guts. Dust filled the air like ash.

Behind it—wooden beams. And a gap.

Big enough to crawl through.

Inside the walls, it was tighter than I expected.

Spiderwebs clung to my face. The wood groaned around me. But I knew the house—*my house*. And I knew that if I went up just a little further, past the bathroom vent, past the pipes, past the beams…

I could get to the attic.

It was a short crawl.

But it felt like a mile.

The attic opened like a mouth.

The lightsaber buzzed softly, casting everything in a red haze.

And then I saw it.

The creature.

It stood taller than a man. Skin stretched too tight. Limbs long and crooked. Its mouth hung open—not for a scream, not a growl, just a sound like breathing from the bottom of a well.

Its eyes locked on me.

It charged. I pulled back a marble in the slingshot and let it fly and it bounced off its skull.

I swung the lightsaber. Plastic cracked across its arm.

It didn’t flinch.

It lunged— snarling and snapping its teeth at me I tossed my arm forward

And it bit down on my cast.

I screamed. Felt the pressure. The pain.

I slammed the saber against its skull over and over, backing toward the old boxes in the corner.

One toppled.

A can of paint thinner splattered onto the floor. The creature lifted me with one hand and chucked me against the far wall my arm getting tangled in wires in the corner. The weight of my body jerking them from their place and causing sparks to fly out into the air of the attic.

The flame caught the insulation like a match to dry leaves. The mix of the paint thinner and the sparks made it go up quick.

Whoosh.

Fire spread fast.

Too fast.

The attic filled with smoke.

Flames danced across the beams, chewing up memories. Christmas boxes. Old furniture. Toys.

The creature screamed.

A real one this time.

Animal and furious.

I scrambled for the window, climbing up onto the roof.

Smoke poured from the attic window behind me, thick and black, curling into the sky like a signal flare. The heat licked at my back as I scrambled onto the pitched roof, my cast thudding against the shingles.

The monster came through the fire.

It burst out of the window like a living shadow, its skin scorched and blistered, its claws dragging sparks across the wood. Parts of it still smoked. One shoulder was blackened. The side of its face looked like melted wax—but it didn’t stop.

It moved like it couldn’t feel pain.

Like it had never been alive in the first place.

I turned and ran, slipping across the slanted rooftop, nails tearing at the shingles as I tried to crawl higher. The slope dipped fast near the edge, right above the driveway. One wrong step and I’d fall.

The creature lunged again.

I spun, swinging the broken lightsaber hilt like a club. It caught the monster’s jaw with a *crack*, sending it staggering, but only for a second. It came back harder—claws slashing.

One caught my side.

The fabric of my shirt ripped. I felt heat and pain, and then blood.

I screamed.

“GET AWAY FROM ME!”

I shoved it. Hard. With everything I had.

We both slid.

Shingles ripped free beneath our weight. The roof groaned under us. A beam snapped with a deep *POP* from below.

I tried to dig my fingers into the edge. My cast scraped uselessly along the surface.

The creature grabbed my leg.

I kicked wildly, boots slamming into its burned face. Its grip loosened for just a second—

And that’s when the roof gave way.

There was a deep, horrible *cracking* sound, and suddenly everything tilted.

The whole corner of the roof collapsed in flames.

We fell together, tangled—me and the thing that wasn’t supposed to exist.

The air ripped past me.  
Heat roared up to meet us.  
Then—

Blackness…

 

The lights were soft. The air sterile. Machines beeped in slow, steady rhythms.

I opened my eyes.

White sheets.

An IV in my arm.

My wrist in a new cast.

And Dad, sitting beside me, his arm bandaged in thick, burnt gauze.

“You’re awake,” he said quietly.

My throat was dry. “Tori?”

“She’s okay. Your mom’s still with her.”

I nodded.

“House is gone nearly” he said. “Burned up the attic and your room, the Fire chief says it started in the attic. Electrical wiring. That’s what they think.”

I looked away.

“I pulled you out from under what was left of your room,” he continued. “the doctor’s said it was a miracle.” 

I didn’t answer. I looked at his arm that was bandaged, he must have been burnt in the fire trying to save me.

 A knock came at the door.

Dr. Kim stepped in, holding a folder.

She smiled softly at me. “Good to see you, sweetheart. We ran a scan while you were under.”

She handed the folder to Dad.

He opened it.

Stared for a long time.

Then he turned it toward me.

An MRI.

Black and white. Fuzzy.

But clear enough.

Something round, pressing into part of my brain.

Like a shadow blooming behind my eyes.

Dad’s voice cracked.

“There’s your monster…”

Due to mental health and emotional reasons, I gained more weight till I became almost obese, and health issues came with it, so I’m bouncing back.

2-My Knowledge: fasting was a hyperfixation thing for me first time I knew about it, so I know all about electrolytes, water poisoning, glucose, etc.

3-My Goal: I typically don’t do strict, 100% only water and pink salt extended fasts, I prioritise feeling good throughout rather than forcing myself to get max benefits.

4-How I went about my fast: I had black coffee, water, water with pink salt, 15-cal ginger and honey drink for vitamins, pickle water, electrolyte drink with B, E, and A vitamins. I also have magnesium citrate and C vitamin capsules, but didn’t need them, I also didn’t feel the urge to chew gum to suppress wanting to eat.

No exercise whatsoever, I’m fasting before the period of final exams, so I was able to distract myself with hours of studying and sleeping instead.

I’ll break my fast about in hour, in which I’ll start with a vegetable broth and lemon, scrambled eggs and cucumber half an hour or 40 minutes later, and wait another half an hour before eating Greek yogurt with blueberries. Slow is safer.

5-Benefits: HUGE development with my bladder issue, I don’t leak or piss myself as nearly as before I started the fast. Urges are less frequent and painful as well.

Sleep is more satisfying, in a sense? I’m getting high quality, non-disturbed sleep, even if it’s just 5 hours. 

I was able to concentrate on studying and study for hours on end, studying math and finance but I’m getting it.

I feel less heart pain or that “cloggy” feeling in my chest or lungs. My skin seems to be getting better and not as dry or bloody, I considered extending it to a 5 day fast to maximise benefits for my skin but not sure how I’ll fare with it.


Throughout the fast, I had slight headaches that might have been sleep or dehydration related, I never felt nauseous or dizzy, and my stress levels are almost non existent.",5,1747936049.0,fasting,2,1.0,False

Too many pimples, despite eating healthy and staying away from sugar","Feeling so frustrated lately. It’s been about 1.5 months since I made big lifestyle changes to manage my PCOS—eating a lot more fruits and veggies, cutting down coffee by about 80%, and avoiding sugar 95% of the time. I’ve also been walking 10,000 steps a day and really trying to reduce inflammation through diet.

Despite all this, I’m still breaking out with new pimples. I’ve been on a prolonged period for 12 days now (though it looks like it might finally be ending), and it came after 4 months of nothing.

I’ve even started doing Korean skincare recently (just the last 4 days), hoping it might help. But honestly, it’s disheartening not to see much improvement yet after all this effort.

If anyone has gone through something similar or has tips that worked for them—whether diet, supplements, skincare, or anything else—I’d really appreciate any advice or encouragement",2,1747935751.0,PCOS,12,1.0,False

*A folktale of longing, wild bloom, and shadowed forests*  
**By Rowan Graves**

*I hope you like it, I’m hoping to grow as a writer-feedback is welcome*

---

All Mara ever wanted to be was a mother. For as long as she could remember, it wasn’t just a dream—it was part of her.  
Baby showers sparked a fire in her belly. Tiny socks and soft cotton onesies filled her chest with heavy longing. She already had a nursery set up in her small home. *Just in case.*

But the right man never came—she worried he never would.  
As the years passed, the hope began to sour into fear. *What if she was never chosen? What if she missed her chance?*

Then, one morning on the way to work, she saw it.  
**Sunshine Grove Fertility.**

Mara’s heart surged. The sign was cheerful, hanging beneath a carved wooden sunflower. It felt like fate. At lunch, she called to make an appointment, half-expecting them to push her to the bottom of the list—single, childless, not part of a “real” family.

But the woman on the line didn’t hesitate.  
*“We’d love to help you grow your garden,”* she said sweetly. *“We have an opening next Thursday.”*

All week, Mara daydreamed of growing a child of her own—someone to raise and shape. To hold. To love.  
The kind of love that came from bringing a piece of yourself into the world.

---

**Thursday arrived like a dream.**  
Sunshine Grove was every bit as perfect as she’d imagined: warm and farmhouse-like, with pale yellow siding, white shutters, and window boxes overflowing with violets and creeping thyme.

The sign on the porch read:  
***“At Sunshine Grove, we help you nurture your garden…and grow your family.”***

Mara had butterflies in her stomach. She stepped inside, inhaling the scent of fresh coffee and lavender. The lobby was all soft pastels, overstuffed chairs, and soothing lullabies.

At the desk sat an old woman with a halo of white hair and a storybook smile. She looked up and said gently,  
*“You must be Mara. We’ve been expecting you.”*

Mara was smiling so hard her face hurt as she filled out the paperwork. As she waited for her name to be called, she began to daydream—tiny hands, tiny voice saying *mama*, pitter-patter of little feet.

She was so deliriously happy that she didn’t see it—the waiting room was empty. No other patients, or families were there. The phone didn’t ring, and the nurse wasn’t filing paperwork—just **staring at Mara**.

The nurse’s eyes didn’t waver. Blue, pale as milk glass, unblinking.

Mara glanced up from her clipboard, the smile still half-formed on her lips.  
*“Everything okay?”* she asked, a nervous laugh tucked beneath the question.

The nurse’s lips curved gently.  
*“You’re glowing,”* she said softly, like it wasn’t a compliment—but a **confirmation**.

*“Oh.”* Mara flushed, unsure how to respond. *“Thank you—I guess I’m just… really excited.”*

The nurse finally looked away, down at the clipboard Mara handed over. Her fingers were cool and dry as paper.  
*“We’ll be ready for you shortly,”* she murmured.

Mara settled back into her seat, watching the hallway that led deeper into the building. There were no doors marked with names. No chime of phones, no whispers behind closed exam rooms. Just the soft, looping lullaby overhead.

---

Everything went as planned—and faster than she expected.  
Mara met the doctor, picked a donor, did a couple tests. Within a few minutes the doctor told her she was ready for implantation—**today**!

She thanked the doctor and the sweet nurse. She left feeling like she was floating, rubbing her belly and making plans.

In a few weeks she tested—**two pink lines showed up in seconds!**  
Mara was going to be a mom, finally.

---

The first few months were rough. Morning sickness wracked her body. Only rare steak stayed down—so raw it practically bled on the plate. She lost so much weight she went to the clinic to make sure her baby was okay.

The nurse reassured her—everything was fine. Baby was growing, and healthy. The doctor gave her a medicine—it came in a green tincture bottle.

*“Two drops a day,”* she said. When Mara made a face, she added, *“It’s herbal. Grown in our garden. For difficult pregnancies.”*

---

The second trimester was wonderful. The baby moved and those butterfly kicks were perfect.  
She could finally eat more than just steak, and her bump had finally popped. Everyone knew she was pregnant. Mara felt blissful.

Her nursery room had taken shape—forest themed. It had diapers, toys, blankets, mommy and me outfits, and even a mobile with forest critters.

---

The third trimester was almost perfect. The baby moved regularly. Footprints on her belly. Little hands pushing at her side.  
The butterflies had turned into rapids as her due date approached.

---

**The night she went into labor was stormy.**  
Thunder roared. Lightning crashed.

Sunshine Grove had sent their midwife so Mara could have a home birth—just as she’d planned.

The midwife arrived in green scrubs, with lush golden hair and kind lavender eyes. A sunflower tattoo on her forearm. When lightning struck behind her, Mara could’ve sworn—*she saw wings.*

*“I’m Thaleia,”* her voice was soothing, melodic. *“Sunshine Grove wants you to be comfortable and cared for.”*

Thaleia lit candles and opened curtains. The storm raged, and she just hummed a lullaby.

*“You’ve done so well,”* the nurse said, feeling Mara’s belly.  
*“He’s growing strong. Eager.”*

---

Labor gripped Mara like twisting roots. Each contraction dragged through her like something ancient pulling free—thorns tearing, vines coiling tight around her spine and thighs. With every push they pulled at her core, like she wasn’t giving birth—it was **clawing its way out**.

The storm crescendoed. Branches cracked. Windows rattled.

As her child crowned, the lights flickered—**darkness engulfed the living room.** Only the candles remained. Tiny stars to witness his arrival.

Then he came—**wailing his presence to the world.**  
The candles flared green, then snuffed out.

Thaleia cleaned him and wrapped him in a soft forest green muslin blanket. She handed him to Mara, her lavender eyes full of warmth… and something unreadable.

*“What a wild garden you’ve grown,”* Thaleia whispered, brushing the baby’s cheek. *“So full of promise… and teeth.”*

Mara didn’t understand.  
And she didn’t care.  
Her baby was here. He was perfect.

Ten fingers. Ten toes. A mop of dark curly hair and moss-colored eyes that opened *immediately*—and stared straight into hers.

Mara wept, exhausted and overflowing with joy. For the first time in her life, she felt whole.

---

But the days and months that followed… were strange.

Her son didn’t cry—not even once.  
He watched everything—eyes full of strange understanding.

The animals came first.  
Raccoons huddled on the porch like pilgrims.  
Birds slammed into the nursery window.  
A fox sat at the back door one night, staring in—*its eyes full of worship.*

---

The yard bloomed wildly. Flowers Mara had never planted burst into bloom. Ivy climbed the nursery wall.  
When her son started babbling, it wasn’t *mama*—it was a language she didn’t know. Something deep and green and *wrong*.

At night, she found him sitting in his crib, staring at her.  
Talking.  
Eyes glowing faintly.

---

She tried to tell herself it wasn’t real.  
Babies don’t speak ancient languages.  
Their eyes don’t glow.  
Wild animals don’t worship your child.

Then one night she woke to an empty crib.  
Panic gripped her.

She searched the house.  
She heard his voice—*calling her from every room.*

Then she heard laughter—sweet and drifting from above.  
She looked up.

He was crawling across the ceiling, giggling.

---

Mara doesn’t sleep much now.

Once, in desperation, she tried to return to Sunshine Grove.

But it was gone.  
No cheerful sign. No pastel walls.  
Just a **rotting building**. Roof caved in. Windows broken.

Inside, vines choked the furniture. The walls were carved with runes and spirals.  
Half-buried in the dirt, she found the old sign:

**“We help you nurture your garden… and grow your family.”**

---

Now, she and her son live in a cottage deep in the woods.  
He is happier.  
The forest is happier.  
Mara doesn’t sleep much anymore.

He sings.

Spectre Wraith atm smells like play-doh. The coffee and dark chocolate notes are there. The rum comes through. But it doesn’t smell anywhere near as “edible” like BP did to me. 

Veneno starts off nice and smoky but the apple/cinnamon shisha smell almost comes and takes over entirely. It becomes too gourmand for my liking and the smokiness almost disappears? 

With that said, as a separate gourmand fragrance, Veneno still smells nice but Spectre Wraith has been a bit disappointing and synthetic. What are your experiences?

Brunhilde: Hmmmm…

Siegfried sighs, setting down the coffee and walking to her, giving her a hug from behind

Siegfried: Is everything ok my love? You seem distressed

Brunhilde: I'm… worried… I was talking to sister Sekhmet and the God's she told me got in… not one seems like they could betray the gods… Perseus normally could but… last time I saw him he was talking with Zeus and Zeus seemed to hold something over him… what… what if we go into a draw and I'm not prepared…

Siegfried: Come on Brun, you've always got a plan, Ragnarok is in three weeks, surely you can figure something out

Brunhilde: I know Sieg, thank you for being by my side

Brunhilde gives Siegfried a kiss as she looks back to the screen, opening up a file with hundreds of humans displayed

Brunhilde: Where do I even start…

Brunhilde: ‘Right, Hermes emailed me this a few weeks ago, I never opened it not knowing what it was… no harm can come from looking at it I suppose’

Brunhilde clicks it as a list of 100 names pops up in front of her

Brunhilde: What… is this

She reads the note attached to the file

Hermes: “Dear Brunhilde, Lord Zeus requested I send you something to help you pick your fighters to make it as interesting as possible, so I put together this list for you, they call these people Mavericks, 100 of the most notable wild cards in human history, I hope their satisfactory to your needs, sincerely, Hermes”

Brunhilde chuckles, Siegfried smiling as he looks up from his book

Siegfried: Figure something out Brun?

Brunhilde: Yes, I think i did, Hermes sent me a list of a class of humans I hadn't heard of, Mavericks

Narrator: Maverick, a term meaning an unorthodox or independent-minded person, in the heavens this term is put onto any Human the gods find a danger to them, independent minds are more likely to stand up to God's and are completely unpredictable, giving this title that threatens them

Brunhilde scrolls through smiling as she nods

Brunhilde: Options are steep, but I think i have an idea, I'll test them

Siegfried looks confused as he looks to his wife

Siegfried: Test them? And with that you've lost me

Brunhilde: I'll have them battle to earn their spot as the tie breaker, surely some are interested right…

Siegfried: I suppose so

Brunhilde looks at the first name, Sir Isaac Newton, nodding as she gets up

Brunhilde: I'll grab Goll and we'll get going to find them all

She kisses Siegfried waving as she walks out, later she walks into a lab with Goll behind her, multiple scientists that had accompanied Tesla hard at work

Brunhilde: Newton, are you here

Nearby, with Marie Currie and Thomas Edison is Newton working out an equation

Edison: Come on you two, clearly the suit should be more energy based, it would give more speed and allow for stronger hits

Curie: But if we do radiation then it would last longer and give more punch to the energy beams

Newton: Can you two shut up, it's getting annoying, we need something better to get the suit through a fight… hmmm

The three turn, Goll hiding as their gazes meet her and Brunhilde

Goll: ‘why are they so intimidating’

Newton: Here to tell us one of us were chosen this Year Brunhilde?

Brunhilde: No, we didn't choose one of you I'm sorry to say

Newton sighs as he puts his hands in his pockets

Newton: Then why are you here?

Brunhilde: I'm gathering Mavericks like you, getting a group together to have a tournament to determine who will fight should there be a tie breaker

Newton scoffs turning as he looks at the board

Newton: Only fools would bother, Ragnarok might not even have a tie, what then

Brunhilde: At least we'd be prepared 

Newton: I'll pass, this is a incredibly dumb plan, but I'll let it backfire on you on your own

Brunhilde scoffs turning

Brunhilde: Let's go Goll

Goll nods waving

Goll: Bye…

The two leave Brunhilde sighing as they walk out, nodding turning to Goll

Brunhilde: It's fine, there's still 99 more and two weeks till we have the tournament, we can make it

A week later Brunhilde has her head in her desk, six names are separated from the list

**‘Sir Lancelot
Johnny Appleseed
Walt Disney

Goll: I see… who's even gonna be announcing it anyways? No offense but you don't really have the personality to pull it off Hilde

A chuckle is heard as a paper airplane lands on the desk, Goll looking to see Buddha approaching

Buddha: Brun asked me to do it since I have the right energy, I don't have anything else going on so I decided to agree to it, oh Brun, I brought one of your friends with me

Achilles steps in, Goll smiling and waving

Goll: Big brother Achilles, it's been awhile, how are you?

Achilles: I'm fine, I got your message Brunhilde and thought my answer should be delivered personally, I heard Odysseus was picked, so should there be a tie breaker i would gladly lend myself to the fight, i never planned to make the cut in the Tribulations when I entered so I'm glad I can join your tournament Brunhilde

Brunhilde: That's seven, one more and we can have a small tournament … hmmm

She clicks some stuff, smiling as she taps a few buttons

Brunhilde: that's 4 more that sent replies, eleven fighters have joined

Buddha: That's good but you sure this is how you wanna do it? After all these guys could end up to hurt to even partake in Ragnarok

Brunhilde: If things get to out of hand I'll tell you when to stop it

Buddha: I get that but… whatever I don't think I can get through to you

In a field a large African American man is sleeping, he has a sledge hammer next to him, he has short cut hair with a nicely trimmed beard, his overalls a little dirty as his his white shirt underneath, a letter falls towards his head, he grabs it waking up his Amber eyes looking closely at it's contents

Henry: A tournament for the tie breaker huh… I don't see why not…

Henry gets up grabbing his hammer and looking at it

Henry: I'm not used to fighting but as long as I've got my people behind me and my strength to guide me i think I'll do ok

Henry whistles as he walks towards a cozy home, his hammer over his shoulder, meanwhile in a nasty part of the heavens, in a city a man in a fedora shoots someone in the head, the person going to niflheim as he sighs, taking some payment as he walks away, he'd wears a brown suit and carries a black leather suit case, putting his gun in his suit as he turns into the street

-Albert Pierrepoint, The Last Hangman, Most Dangerous Executioner in human history, One of the Mavericks-

Albert pulls out a phone answering the call, his deep British accent ringing out

Albert: Yes I have handled your situation, the bastard is dead and I'm on my way to the station now, why did you call anyways? A letter? For me? Fine, I'm on my way

Albert hangs up the phone moving quickly, arriving at a run down prison, walking in and moving to an office, opening the door finding a envelope, opening it and starting to read it

Albert: Let's see here now, a tournament to decide who's fighting should a tie breaker be needed… hmmm… maybe I can take some time off and have a look… a tie breaker would be important after all…

Albert puts the letter down sighing, nodding to himself as he grabs a coat and a cane and walks out, in a yurt a man is sleeping with about twelve woman hugging his large body, varying species of females, all humanoid, the man himself has a more muscular build, a mustache and beard on his face with short, messy hair, to his right are white robes and Mongolian armor, a soldier enters the tent wearing similar but much more simple armor, bowing

-Genghis Khan, Histories most fierce conquer, Most children in human history, One of the Mavericks-

Soldier: My lord an urgent letter has come for you, lady Brunhilde seems to be requesting your presence

Genghis Khan gets up pushing the ladies aside, grabbing his robes and putting them on, turning to the soldier taking the envelope

Genghis: Thank you, take the rest of the day off, my reward for getting this to me as fast as possible

Soldier: Lord Genghis you are to kind, thank you

Genghis nods as the soldier bows before walking out, chuckling as he pulls the envelope open

Genghis: Maybe Brunhilde wishes to take me up on my offer

Genghis reads it chuckling as he puts the letter down looking into a mirror

Genghis: Genghis Khan the god slayer has a nice ring to it, if I have to go through a few people so be it

Genghis chuckles as he approaches a chest, opening it and pulling out a longbow and quiver putting them over his shoulder along with two large swords that he puts to his side chuckling

Helio: You and I got a letter today from Brunhilde

He hands it to Kimura who looks at it

Kimura: Were we selected for Ragnarok then?

Helio: No, she's holding a contest to decide who will fight in a tie breaker for Ragnarok, should it happen, personally I'm not gonna partake, but I figured you might want to have a look since I know you my friend are looking for some excitement in your life

Kimura: Is it that obvious?

Helio: I just saw you throw your opponent in a single move, I figure your not exactly having fun

Kimura chuckles slapping Helio on the back, surprisingly Helio isn't fazed laughing with him

Kimura: You know me to well Gracie, I'll give it a shot, just watch me and know, I want another match now that you've evolved as a fighter

Helio: I'll grant you that rematch at some point, just don't get yourself killed ok

Kimura nods as he stands up stretching

Kimura: I should train a bit for it, never know who I could end up facing right

Kimura smiles walking away as Helio chuckles to himself

Helio: As good as I am, that difference in attitude alone is why I don't think I'll ever be able to beat you my friend

Achilles: Nice arena, heard Brunhilde got it from you

Odysseus chuckles leaning on the wall

Odysseus: Brun told me about the event, figured she needed a spacious place to hold it and make it a event, I have this place collecting dust, why not let her use it

Achilles chuckles giving his friend a hug as Odysseus hugs back, letting go and grabbing Achilles shoulder looking up

Odysseus: don't get reckless out there ok, your one of my best friends, I don't wanna lose you

Achilles: I appreciate the jester Odysseus but I'll be fine, across heaven and earth no one is tougher than me

Odysseus: I'm sure of it, just know to call it quits if ever needed ok

Achilles nods as Odysseus walks away, in the stands Brunhilde is smiling looking as the crowd comes in

Goll: I can't believe 16 actually agreed to fight

Newton: I still think this is a stupid idea

Goll jumps seeing Isaac Newton leaning on the wall, Brunhilde looking at him annoyed

Newton: All your gonna do is get these people hurt all so they get a chance to fight a god, your dooming humanity with your indecisiveness Brunhilde

Brunhilde: Valhalla health care can handle any injuries in just a few hours, we'll be OK

Newton scoffs walking by her

Newton: If things go wrong, just know it's your fault 

Brunhilde ignores him as he walks away, meanwhile Buddha is entering the ring, sipping a soda while reading a script, scratching his head before tossing it away, pulling out a microphone and putting it to his mouth

Buddha: Uh… testing testing, 1,2,3, this thing on… yeah, it is, welcome to The Mavericks tournament or whatever Brun is calling this, sixteen fighters have been chosen to fight for the right to save humanity should a tie happen, the roster being the following

On the screens above it displays the roster fully, chattering and conversations heard among the people

(First bracket)

Sir Lancelot vs Achilles

John Henry vs Johnny Appleseed

El Santo vs Masahito Kimura

Fidel Castro vs Albert Pierrepoint

(Second Bracket)

Allan Pinkerton vs H.H. Holmes

H.P. Lovecraft vs Walt Disney

William Kidd vs Noah

Oda Nobunaga vs Genghis Khan

Buddha: OK, first, fighter in Round 1 Match 1 is this guy, known across the heavens as the unbreakable demi god, he's built a reputation worthy of such a title, even should his armor crack he keeps going, yada, yada, Brun I'm not memorizing every intro you wrote, I'll do my own, a good pal of mine he's always willing to do what's right

Achilles walks out, his cape flowing in the wind as he walks

Buddha: While he may be part god he's always thought of himself as human, willing to do anything to protect the people he cares about, he is the Ultimate DemiGod hero of Greece, he's the one and only, Achilles

Achilles stops chuckling as he turns to Buddha

Achilles: Really out of your element aye Buddha

Buddha chuckles scratching his chin

Buddha: I'm still getting used to this, but I'll get the hang of it… maybe…

Achilles laughs as Buddha sighs putting the microphone up again

Buddha: And his opponent, coming out is the most notable knight in human history, Head Knight of the round table he's known for his indomitable will, he never falter for anything and always stands by his king, the great Arthur

The other doors start to open, Knights start spilling out, raising their swords in salute as a much larger Knight emerges, he wears silver armor, a white fur cloak covering his arms as he walks, from the cloak he pulls out a long sword, a golden hilt with a blade that shines, despite its length he holds it naturally in one hand, his other reveals a shield made from a steel with diamond plating on the front, he reaches the two, stabbing his sword to the ground and removing his helmet, she spikey brown hair spilling out, his golden eyes looking right at Achilles, he has a scar running across his face, from the top left of his head to the right cheek barely missing the eye but leaving part of his left eyebrow with a gap

Buddha: The strongest knight of the round table he wields his sword Arondight like non could ever believe, being only one of two who can match his kings power in the kingdom of Logres none shine like him, for he is the best of the round table, he is Sir Lancelot du Lac

Buddha sighs as the knights leave, Buddha walking to the edge jumping to a private part of the stands where Zerofuku is sitting eating popcorn

Zerofuku: Great job out there Buddha

Buddha: Thanks Zero but I'm not done yet

Buddha raises the mic again

Buddha: Round 1 Match 1, Achilles the Unbreakable vs Lancelot the Unshakable, a battle of raw power and raw defense, let the fight, begin

After 6 months of trying to get into ""real coffee"" — not Nespresso, not pod machines, but actual espresso — I bought a **Delonghi EC685**. Looked decent. Promised 15 bars of pressure. Has a portafilter. A milk frother. What could go wrong?

Turns out: **a lot**.

I tried everything — different beans, different grind sizes, fresh roast, different tamping pressure, new baskets, new techniques. I watched all the YouTube tutorials. I learned what pre-infusion is, what 1:2 ratio means, what extraction time should be. I even built rituals around this thing. But:

* The “double” basket only holds \~9g of coffee. I cannot fit 18g no matter what.
* No matter how fine I grind, the shot **either chokes or gushes**. There’s no in-between.
* The group overheats and steams the puck.
* I always get **30ml from a 9g dose** — which is way off for a true espresso ratio.
* The crema looks dead.
* The milk frother doesn’t create microfoam — just bubbly “grandma cappuccino foam.”

But… **is it just me?**  
Did anyone actually get a **real** espresso experience with the EC685? Or is it just a very good-looking toy?  
I’m honestly curious — did someone *actually* dial this machine in and love it?",1,1747935137.0,espresso,10,1.0,False
1kswp39,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1kswp39/sovereign_city_new_genesis_chapter_3_grey_mornings/,[Sovereign City: New Genesis] Chapter 3: Grey Mornings,"You wake to the soft murmur of the wallshade dissolving - light filters in, not golden, but cool, sterile blue. Simulated morning, configured for optimal cortisol response. The glass pane darkens slightly as your eyes adjust, offering a filtered view of the skyline. Even from here - thirty floors above street level - the pulsing lights of Sovereign City never really fade.

The apartment isn't large, but it isn't a box either. It breathes. Barely.

A single room, smart-partitioned. Efficient space design: smooth walls with embedded utility drawers, modular furniture that folds and adapts with whispered servos. The desk near the window still holds your mother's old glasswork - delicate sandblown sculptures sealed under dust-proof plating. One shaped like a crane. Another, a slow-turning sphere filled with micro-orchids she used to prune every Saturday night before she left for her second job.

You haven't touched them. Not in a year.

You stir, groggy, on the edge of sleep - until the stim injector finds your neck with all the tenderness of a tax audit. *Pssht.* A chemical slap to the brainstem later, and you're bolt upright, eyes wide, heart negotiating with gravity. Morning achieved. Consent questionable. A soft chime blinks from the medical console in the corner - your vitals are within range, but stress spikes have triggered a health suggestion: ""Consider mindfulness. Would you like to play a 60-second breathing exercise?"" It chirps.

You ignore it.

Your jacket hangs by the door, collar half-folded. You pick it up, flick the lapel once, and a faint violet shimmer activates just above the shoulder seam - a personal holochip, sputtering to life like a firefly inside a glass.

A second later, Saren's face appears above your collarbone - grainy, then stabilizing.

""You...look like a firmware update gone wrong.""

You smirk, stretching as your spine realigns with a few reluctant pops. ""Nice to see your morning cheer survived another overnight shift.""

Behind him, construction cranes groan and lift; synthetic loaders hum through steel channels. He leans against a stack of ion couplings and wipes sweat from his temple with a sleeve. Same old yard. Loud, relentless, always one weld away from disaster.

""So? You gonna tell me what the hell happened last night?"" Saren asks with a hint of envy in his voice.

""I met with Cutter.""

Saren whistles. ""The man himself. Did he offer you a free leash and a smile?""

""Gold Dyns, actually.""

Saren's grin is immediately wiped from his face. ""You're not thinking about saying yes?""

You shrug. ""I'm thinking about not starving in ten years.""

Saren shakes his head. ""Whatever you do, just remember what your mom taught us. Nobody gives you a ladder unless they get to decide where it leads.""

Before you can reply, the holo sputters - his face shivers and dims. Time's up. The unfortunate reality of buying tech with Grey Dyns. Perhaps not for much longer.

You run your hands down your face, jaw tight, and make your way over to the wash chamber for a two-minute rinse. The smartglass steams, music starts automatically, something soft, orchestral. She used to play this in the mornings, and it still loads from her profile. You haven't deleted it.

You stare at your reflection, water tracking down the faint scar at your temple. You've changed. The apartment hasn't. And somehow that's worse. You dry off, dress, zip up your jacket - collar snapping back into place with a small magnetic hum. A soft *click* follows as the door disengages, and after a time, you step out into your personal descent pod. You step in, the door seals - quick input for the street level into the PDP interface, and you're off. The familiar sounds of the acceleration dampeners and kinetic balancers to start your day, as you descend to the lobby. Gravity seems to take a break for a moment... you're not falling, but *floating* downward, deep inside the interwoven bowels of your apartment complex.

Thirty seconds later, the pod kisses the ground-level cradle with a soft magnetic sigh. The door folds away, revealing the lobby's familiar, welcoming embrace. The city meets you with a high-frequency buzz - not from sound, but from presence. Pedestrians stride across high-gloss platforms, corporate logos glowing on jackets, contact lenses, artificial limbs. Fashion here isn't an accessory. It's an identity contract. Even the street vendors are brand-licensed, peddling microdoses of engineered energy, nutrient pills, skin mods.

Holograms bloom above the mag-lines, advertising Tier Ascension Packages and emotional recalibration suites. One billboard reads:

""Upgrade Yourself. Become the Future.""

You adjust your collar and start moving, the familiar rhythm of the city swallowing you whole. Corporate drones drift overhead like absent-minded gods, and somewhere in the distance, a rhythm of jackhammers plays counterpoint to the steady hum of urban decay.

Your collar pings - holochip activation inbound. Saren's face flickers into life, slightly grainy, lit by the jaundiced lighting of whatever ductwork-adjacent break room he's hunkered down in now. His eyebrows are already raised.

""Took you long enough. What, the city roll out a red carpet for you this morning?""

You smirk. ""No, but I did get blessed by a vending machine that actually dispensed my coffee.""

""Miraculous."" Saren retorts. ""Next thing you'll tell me is your stim injector didn't jab you in the jugular.""

You hold up the faint red dot just above your collarbone.

""Oof. Sovereign tech strikes again. We really are living in the future.""

You shift your footing as a corporate enforcer walks by, their shoulder-mounted scanner whirring with interest before moving on.

""How's our benevolent cyberpharaoh treating you? Thought you were gonna let Cutter's goons embed a corporate tracking implant while you slept.""

""They tried,"" you deadpan. ""I told them my blood type was proprietary.""

Saren snorts. ""Careful. Cutter probably has a patent on sarcasm too.""

You roll your eyes. ""He hasn't had me decapitated yet. So... better than the Yelp reviews implied.""

""Wow. High praise. Have you decided to accept that Dyn upgrade, or are you still rocking that sad little Gray card like the rest of us peasants?""

You pause. Then flash a smirk.

""Wait. No. No, you didn't.""

You can feel his disbelief mounting. ""I did.""

""You son of a -! You could buy an apartment window with that thing.""

""Half a window.""

""Still better than my current setup, which is an actual hole.""

You both laugh, and for a moment it feels like none of this matters - Dyns, deals, debts. Just two idiots trading punches across a comm link.

Then Saren sobers slightly. ""Hey. Seriously though. You haven't said yes, right?""

""Not yet.""

""Good. Because once you do, you don't come back the same. I've seen it, man. The smile they give you when you sign is the last honest expression you'll ever get from them.""

You nod, slowly. The laughter fades, replaced by a silence that feels a lot like loyalty... and warning.

""Anyway,"" Saren continues, ""just don't go getting assassinated before we finish that synth-beer bet. You still owe me a drink.""

You raise a brow. ""I distinctly remember *winning* that bet.""

""You remember wrong.""

The line goes static for a moment. His image warps, then vanishes. Just like always.

Almost immediately, your collar springs back to life. ""Holocall incoming – Maxim Cutter."" You accept the call.

A familiar golden flare sparks to life midair.

Maxim Cutter appears - clean, poised, always slightly backlit like someone edited him for gravitas in real time. His chrome-lined eyes study you not like a person, but a prototype. The kind he hasn't decided whether to invest in or scrap.

""You've taken your time."" He says.

""I've been thinking.""

""Dangerous habit, that.""

You exhale. ""Gold Dyns. Debt forgiveness. Lifetime upgrades. All very... shiny.""

""But?""

""But I've seen what happens to people who say yes too easily.""

Maxim smiles thinly. ""And yet you showed up. That tells me you're either smarter than most - or already halfway mine.""

You cross your arms. ""You talk like the world is your chessboard.""

""Correction. It *was* my chessboard. Now it's my IPO.""

He stands, turning slightly. Behind him, the skyline glows like a trophy case. ""Do you know what most people do with a Gold Dyn, the moment it lands in their lap?""

""Frame it. Get robbed.""

""Close. They waste it trying to feel like they're in control of their lives again. You, on the other hand... have the chance to actually be.""

You stare at him. Long enough to make the silence uncomfortable.

""Let's say I bite. What's the catch?""

Maxim taps something just offscreen. A contract unfurls between you - golden threads of data shimmering like spider silk.

""No catch. You'll do a few tasks. Help stabilize some volatile interests. Maybe keep a few inconvenient truths from reaching the wrong ears.""

You raise an eyebrow. ""So espionage. Intimidation. Enforcement.""

""Business.""

You sigh. ""And if I say no?""

""Then your debt remains. And we both pretend this conversation never happened.""

His voice lowers. Not threatening, just final.

""The world won't wait. But I will - for a little while longer.""

You stare at the contract.

At the number.

At the life that number represents.

Then, slowly... you nod.

""I'm in.""

Maxim's image vanishes mid-transmission. Replaced almost instantly by a thinner man with a body like a suggestion: long fingers, gaunt face, hair sculpted into corporate perfection.

""Jeremiah Kode. Executive Asset Coordination. Welcome to the operational tier, Agent.""

You barely have time to speak before he overlays a projection in front of your eyes - sleek, clean, spinning blueprints and logistics in real-time.

""Your first assignment is classified under Asset Contingency Recovery Protocol 51.""

He says it like it means something to you.

""One of our biotech couriers - Theta-Six - was intercepted en route to the R&D vertical at Grid 305. Hostile actors presumed to be freelancers with known Purist sympathies.""

""What's the payload?""

""Prototype neuro-lattice regenerators. If stolen, they could be reverse-engineered into open-market limb autonomy solutions. Unsanctioned competition.""

You realize he's not talking about medicine. He's talking about monopoly.

He continues. ""Intercept the hostiles. Secure the package. Neutralize if necessary. Collateral damage... is frowned upon. But not prohibited.""

You nod once, pulse picking up. ""Anything else?""

""Survive. Gold Dyns don't collect interest if their owners die.""

The holo closes.

And you're alone again.

But not really.

Because from this moment forward, you belong to the system.

Following the coordinates you were given, the location is an abandoned freight platform, rusted over and half-reclaimed by graffiti and shadow. Drones flicker above, scanning autonomously but sluggish, as if they've been hacked into idleness.

You hear it before you see it.

Two figures locked in brutal motion. One in Sovereign red-black tactical gear - lean, enhanced with carbon-weave musculature and glowing oculars. The other-whom you assume to be the freelance shock trooper, is broader - wearing reinforced mesh armor marked with white hexes. No visible augments, but every move hits like hydraulics.

Blades extend from the Sovereign's forearms - shimmering vibra-steel edges that sing with each slash.

The shock trooper's shield ripples with electromagnetic light, absorbing a strike - then retaliating with a kinetic pike that hums on impact.

You duck behind a crate, pulse hammering, breath caught in your throat.

The fight is a dance of death.

The Sovereign lunges, flips mid-air, blades carving arcs of plasma-tinged fury. The Purist rolls, slamming a boot into the ground - detonating a shockwave pulse from his heel mod. Sevceral laser bolts flash - deflected by an energy shield, but the feedback fries part of the shock troopers bracer. Sparks fly as their weapons clash. Blood, not oil, hits the floor. The shock trooper appears to human, perhaps unaugmented, but still bleeding.

The Sovereign kicks off a wall, diving in with a scream distorted by voice mods, blade angled for the kill.

A misstep.

The trooper pivots, slamming the pike *through* the Sovereign's midsection. A gargled hiss escapes the attacker's modded throat. They twitch, drop their blades, fall.

Dead.

But before you can even exhale, the agent looks up. Sees you.

You freeze.

Then - a flash. A holo-smoke grenade detonates, warping the light in a burst of refracted color. You cough, stumble forward -

and when it clears, he's gone.

Silence settles.

Only the corpse remains, metal still humming with residual charge. You step forward, heart racing, breath ragged, and realize: this is what war looks like. Not broadcasts. Not billboards. This. The result of clashing ideologies brewing war.

Sovereign against Purist. Flesh and chrome colliding in a city that doesn't blink.

Your chip blinks.

Another message.

Cutter, again.

""You're still alive. Impressive. Consider that your orientation.""

You don't reply.

You're too busy looking at the blood on your hands.

I’m just coming down from a meltdown so if something is unclear, I’d be happy to answer questions in the comments. Im a little scattered brained, im going to try to be concise. 

Also quick content warning for Vomiting for any queasy folks out there! 

So I, 19F have been working at an international coffee chain for a little over a year. I have to admit, I’ve had issues with calling out too frequently or on days that inconvenience our staff and manager. Im aware it doesn’t make a difference, my absence is still an issue, but I’ve been struggling with CVS (cyclical vomiting syndrome)  
Basically in the mornings, when I’m stressed; it comes and goes in waves. I get super nauseous and will frequently have to rush to the restroom or nearest trash can to throw up. Sometimes I feel fine afterwards and will go to work anyways or I will push myself to go to work because I’ve already called out too many times, they need me on the schedule, or it’s a holiday/product launch. 
I frequently go to work sick and nauseous, half the time when I do call out my manager will push me to go in anyway. Especially if I didn’t start getting sick 3 hours before the shift, that’s our calling in stipulation. More times than not i will still go in because I feel guilty, even if that means having to throw up in the work bathroom multiple times a shift. It’s something I just have to put up with, and it sucks. Sometimes I can’t just put up with it and I have to convince my manager it’s not one of the power through days. 
I’ve had a many of discussion with my Management about this and I’ve had to procure 3 doctors notes within the past year so I don’t get fired. I’ve already been written up once for calling out. 
To get an idea of the frequency, within a month I will have probably called in 3 times, 2 of which I will just go in later than my original shift time. I also usually work 36-40 hours weekly. 
I feel I should also mention, I’ve never once called in when I wasn’t sick. I’ve never taken a mental health day (even though there are days I wish I fuckin could man) and I’ve never just tried to get out of work to have the day off. 
Now onto this morning. 
I was scheduled from 8am-4pm. I woke up at like 7:15 and immediately had to vom, my head is also pounding because of an ear infection I have. Off the bat, not off to a great start but I have to be at work in 45 minutes. After the third time with my throbbing head hung over my toilet, i decided to check the schedule to see if I could find somebody to cover for me. We have to find coverage if it’s not 3 hours before a shift. 
(I also always offer to buy who ever covers for me a meal, coffee, snack for the covered shift and take one of theirs if it aligns with my next day off). So literally everybody at work is either out of town or only has the one day off. 
My manager was off today and she had been yesterday as well so I called her. My phone service was having problems so I wifi called her twice, used my mom’s phone twice, used the family business phone, and still no answer. I also tried our assistant manager. 
I called the store to let them know I was trying desperately to get a hold of our manager, not only to cover but I would need to tell her as well that I wouldn’t be going in. 
I’m now sobbing and panicking because I know I can’t take showing up to work, my head is spinning, I’m sobbing, vomiting, and hyperventilating in rapid intervals. My coworker who answered is a saint, she assured me that they weren’t going to struggle without me and offered to try to get in touch with management. No luck there. 
My uncle works on the grocery store side of things, he tried to get in touch with the store managers to let him know we couldn’t contact coffee place management. They also arent in today. 
I started freaking out more because it’s 10 past when I needed to be there. I was panicking and sobbing so hard that my uncle went ahead and told coffee house that I wouldn’t be going in today despite not contacting management or finding a replacement. 
The store called back like an hour ago (not my direct managers, just the store)  and said dont even worry about having a doctors note because they are going to consider this a no call no show and I’ll have to sign a write up and have a disciplinary meeting. 
I know this is the result of my choice not to just go in today after not getting a hold of anybody, but I am in no condition to be on my feet for 8 hours and dealing with just everything else. It’s been hell here for a moment. we’ve got people quitting; one of which who does like 50% of my managers job even though he’s not the assistant manager. My manager also has been fucking me over by not supplying our food items and putting them in defrost when opening shift is supposed to leaving it for me in the evening doubling my work load, scheduling me one day off for two weeks by making me work bullshit hours, guilt tripping me any time I’ve asked for days off or to come in even after I’ve told her I’ve been consecutively sick, scheduling me by myself to close on weekends when it’s busy, releasing the new schedule on the last day of the old leaving the upcoming work schedule a mystery untill the day before. This feels like my last straw, but I know this is just a consequence of calling out too late. I feel like a winey little bitch. 
I’m frustrated, with myself and with my management. I don’t know if I should contest the write up, just take it and move on, or just put in my two weeks and find something different. Any and all advice is appreciated!! Please reality check me, if that’s what I need. 
Let me know what yall would do if you were in my position, I don’t know how I should deal with this. I want to be as professional and respectful as possible.

For some context, my wife has a hormonal disorder and a side effect of that is weight gain. I mention this because generally speaking it's not unusual for her to intermittent fast or try different diets as she's been figuring out what works for her body. That being said, she's always been more focused on being healthy than her appearance. 

Last Wednesday we were leaving an evening event around 9pm, and she broke down crying in the car out of nowhere and asked if we could stop on the way home for something to eat. I have only seen my wife cry a handful of times, and never about being hungry so this really jarred me. After we stopped I asked when the last time she ate was and she said Monday. 

The following day it was still bugging me, so I noticed when she didn't eat dinner. Our schedules/diets/eating habits are really different so it's not that unusual for us to not eat the same thing or at the same time but all she wanted was coffee and when I asked if she'd already eaten she said no, she just wasn't hungry. Friday, same thing. Around 9 or so she was at her desk so I just brought her a snack and drink, and she ate that.

After she didn't eat all weekend (at least that I saw), I brought home subs for dinner on Monday and she had one. But I haven't seen her eat a meal since. Whenever I ask or press about it she just says she's not hungry, but it's hard to believe that when I saw her cry because she was so hungry last week. 

I reached out to her best friend who has known her a whole lot longer to ask if she's ever had ED issues and the answer was no. Her best friend mentioned my wife had said she'd been having 'food issues' lately but she (my wife) didn't specify what that meant. 

Everything else in life has been really normal. Our sex life is good, she hasn't seemed depressed, and she's super excited about some new charities and things she's getting involved with. 

I am really concerned about her though, and I'm looking for some advice on things I could say if she keeps brushing it off casually or other things I could look out for to clue me in on what's happening. 

 tl;dr - My wife isn't eating much, isn't opening up about it, and I could use some help navigating how to talk to her and get her help if she needs it.",13,1747934911.0,relationship_advice,16,0.93,False

Hours worked 28/04 (first day) - 23/05 (first payday) = 35.9 hours 

The pay period being 01/05 - 31/05 (cutting off the one 4.22 hour shift I worked in April) 

So if I’m paid within this pay period 01/05 - 31/05. I’ve worked and been scheduled for 42.9 hours + a 4 hours paid holiday which would bring me to 46.9 hours. 

I’ve only been paid for 29.42 hours? Has there been a mistake or am I not understanding something? 

Looks like I’m not being paid for April because it was before this pay period and after the last one? 

If I add my April hours and this pay period (01/05 - 31/05) hours together, overall I’m owed pay for a total of 51.12 hours. Instead I’ve been paid for 29.42 hours?

And I have owned all of these for the past two months. So I am in a position to answer any question about these from you all who wish to make a full bottle purchase, but are on the fence due to real world reviews. 

In a nutshell I'll review based on few categories:

Ramon Monegal flamenco extrait: If you're looking for an absolute nuclear fragrance get this. Two sprays and you'll leave trail for the next 4-5 hours. Unfortunately now it's sold out in pranays site. Else I would have purchased it myself. It's a raspberry fruity rose combo which is very pleasing to the nose. 

Ambre Nuit/ Roja midsummer dream: If you're looking for a fresh elegant powdery fragrance which can be worn year around which is unobtrusive yet always stays long. This would be it. These both are an olfactory equivalent of a charming prince. 

Caron Oud Excelsa: If you love spiced coffee note and at the same time don't wish to come across as a culinary specimen do try oud Excelsa. This version of caron uses very high quality natural derivates. Very good for cold weather with great longevity.

Pengaligons Babylon: This was a purchase i did because of Demi Rawling. I trust her nose (though she does work with brands). This one was a hyped fragrance under her ""smell elegant and rich"" category. Its a smoky and boozy vanilla scent. Well I imagine that wearing this you smell like a rich merchant of some bygone era in Babylon. If smelling expensive is your thing go for it. 

Widian London:

Fine leather rose combo. Performance is very strong and can cause headache if over sprayed.
For lovers of leather fragrance which isn't skany go for it.

It's the YoHealth app — it rewards you with crypto tokens for walking. I’ve been consistently withdrawing from it, nothing life-changing, but enough for some coffee money here and there.

You download the YoHealth app (it's on Android and iOS).
In the ""Friends"" section, there’s a referral field — you can enter a code (mine was 2250754, you can use it :) ) and get 10k bonus steps.
From there, you just walk. The app tracks your steps, and once per day you need to claim them manually, don’t forget this part or you lose them
Once you hit 160,000 steps, you can exchange them for 1 FTN token (around €3.90). You can also cash out through the Fastex exchange, or use Ortak where the threshold is a bit lower (145k steps).

For example, I was a whale from 2023-2024. I’ve climbed all the way to end game and devoted a serious amount of time and money into the game. At the start of 2025 I decided to go F2P (outside of gem packs) and really cut down on my playing. Here’s what I’ve done to do this. 

1. I no longer bother myself with doing all the quests. I rarely complete daily quests which ultimately means I don’t complete weekly or
Monthly quests. Same goes for advanced quests. Is it inefficient? Absolutely. But after about 2 weeks of this mindset I no longer felt the pull towards completing them all. 

2. I no longer care about being energy efficient. When I was playing all the time in the past I lived by the mantra to never be above energy cap. Now, I let it pile up and use it when I actually want to. 

3. The only daily/weekly things I do are: CB (typically 2-3 keys used each day. Rarely do I do all 4). Hydra, chimera, iron twins, faction wars, doom tower (complete hard, sometimes complete normal) and sintranos (complete hard sometimes complete normal). I can complete my daily tasks each morning while getting ready for work. Usually will set my IT on auto while I take my morning dump. Then run DT while in the shower. Then I run the manual sintranos and FW while I’m cooling off after my shower and drinking my coffee. Some days I don’t even do arena matches. 

4. Joined a clan that doesn’t have cvc requirements. We’re all late/end game but very casual on cvc. We compete in Hydra, chimera, and siege and that’s all I’m interested in. 

5. I used to do every fusion no matter what. Now I only do ones that are actually going to change my account. Which for an end game player is very rare. Nukers are my least often done because they need a 6 star soul to be viable on my account for really any content over my current roster. 


Now I understand I can get away with this far easier than others given I’m end game. The floor for value on my account is so high it means many things just don’t provide me much benefit. And because of my gear/roster I can full auto everything very quickly. So my routine is extremely manageable. On top of that because I’m conserving a lot more often it means when big tournaments occur with rewards I actually want I’m able to go for it without any issue. I’ve got a large stockpile of resources allowing me to still compete against spenders unless I’m up again someone who’s dead set on spending big bucks. 

Ultimately, this balance has made me love and enjoy the game far more. I’d say I actually sit down and play the game maybe one or two days a week for a few hours. Outside of that it’s just quickly running through my personal list of dailies. 

So what time saving and sanity savings things do you guys use to avoid burnout?

She was found as a scared stray and has started to open. She needs a local or out of state foster or adopter now.","Update: Extended to 5/22 11am **(lab starts at 1-1:30pm, meaning there is time)**

Miller (A1241689) is a sweet gentle girl at Dallas Animal Shelter who is fully out of time and needs a Hail Mary. She is 2 years old and just over 50 lbs. 

Miller has multiple options for getting out of this shelter safely —

A local rescue has offered to save Maddy if she can find a foster. **If you are local and wanted to foster rather than adopt, you can message Ruff Road Revival Rescue if local yourself directly on instagram, Facebook, or email. And message me so I can let them know ASAP**

**If you are serious and her listing still up, click “I’m interested” and fill out the application immediately. Email still if not up. Consider calling as well.**

**Additionally another rescue can be asked to save Maddy and arrange transportation a foster can steps up in another state.**

Another dog from DAS is being transported west to northern CA, so if you are anywhere along this route she could be transported for a potentially discounted rate for either a foster or adopter. Additionally, transport is available to the any state or Canada for adoption. I can help connect you with discounted options and regular places to get bids if needed, message me.

Message me if interested in any of these options and I will help facilitate.

Meet Miller, a gentle 2-year-old soul who's looking for a patient and understanding companion. From our observations, Miller tends to be on the quieter side and may take some time to warm up to new people and surroundings. While she initially showed some hesitation during playtime, our volunteers noticed that she gradually became more interested in socializing with other dogs after getting acquainted. Miller seems to prefer a calm and gentle approach, making her a potential great fit for a low-key household.

Field Observation 

02/27: FRIENDLY BUT VERY TIMID 


Volunteer Observation 

03/05: Avoidant/Fearful	

[""Disinterested in Treats""]	

[""Avoiding Eye Contact""]		

Miller was quiet when I approached his kennel and stayed in the far corner.  She did NOT display any concerning behaviors of fear aggression, but it is evident she will take a while to warm up to anyone.  I offered her a treat, but she was not interested. 

One month later:

04/06: Easy Going	

Good Manners	

Social (People);Loose/Wiggly Body	

Love-Bug;Solicits Pets;Solicits Belly Rubs					



Miller is a very sweet girl. Was easy to leash and walks well until all the dogs start to bark, then she gets a little nervous. Outside she wanted affection and when she saw a dog in the next yard, she went to say hi and showed signs of wanting to play. 

Daycation Notes : 

How did your dog do in the car? Eh, I tolerate riding in the car

Which of the following activities did the dog enjoy? Going on a walk, Lounging around a dog-friendly coffee shop / restaurant / bar

How did they interact with strangers? I love meeting new friends!

If they saw any cats, how did they react? N/A

If they saw any other dogs, how did they react? Miller was friendly with other dogs, but as people came by to interact with her and another daycation dog, she appeared to do better with individual attention on her or taking a step back while another dog received attention. While she did not appear to resource guard food or water, it is possible she is protective of attention from humans. 

If they met any children, how did they react? Miller was gentle with children. She allowed pets, was calm and kept a loose, wiggly body.

How did I walk on the leash? (Examples: excited/pulling/timid/awesome walker)Walked well on leash. Was not a leash puller. 

How were my manners and do I know any tricks? Good manners, Went to the bathroom immediately (when outside)

Did they show any of the additional behaviors listed below? Love bug, Solicits pets

The best part of my Daycation was when.......I got tons of treats and got to say hello to people

Any additional notes you would like to include about the dog? Miller is sweet a sweet girl!



Playgroup Assessment 

03/10: PG1 Social , DG Dainty & Gentle 

Timid, initially but slowly beginning to warm up to the other dogs. Would begin to show interest in socializing with the other dogs after getting the chance to get acquainted with them.

Shelter observations:
04/08: Vocal when greeted at kennel door but tail wagging. Easily leashed and easy to walk but was nervous to walk past other kennels. Non-reactive to other dogs in kennels. In the yard she pottied (1 and 2) right away. A little skittish with me initially but warmed up after a few minutes in the yard together. Allowed pets but wasn't overly affectionate. **Sweet and gentle dog. **

Miller is currently at risk due to space in the shelter and needs placement by 11 am May 22nd.

About a month ago Giant Food stores offered their two litre store brand cola on sale for $.99 (reg. $1.25). To the consumer a twentysix cent saving may not be a big deal but a twentysix percent saving probably is. There was, however, a glitch. They didn't have any in stock and for two weeks the ""sale"" remained advertised, but still with no product. And then, two weeks ago, ""bingo"", the shelves were full and have been since. Complicating the mystery is that sales normally are in effect for one week only.

Meanwhile, also about a month ago, Walmart bumped the price of its low cost alternative cola from $1 to $1.22. Walmart is home to the frugal (low income) shopper and those who watch prices. A 22% increase is sure to resonate.

Please note: In comparison, Giant price for both Pepsi and Coke is $3.39 per 2 litre bottle and Walmart is $2.74 for Coke / $2.64 for Pepsi.

 I work on cargo ships, long hauls across the empty stretches of ocean. It’s usually monotonous – the endless blue, the thrum of the engines, the routine. But this last trip… this last trip was different.

It started about ten days out from port, somewhere in the Pacific. I was on a late watch, just me and the stars and the hiss of the bow cutting through the water. That’s when I first saw it. A disturbance in the dark water off the port side, too large to be dolphins, too deliberate for a random wave. Then, a plume of mist shot up, illuminated briefly by the deck lights. A whale. Not unheard of, but this one was big. Really big. And it was close.

The next morning, it was still there, keeping pace with us. A few of the other guys spotted it. Our bosun, a weathered old hand on the sea, squinted at it through his binoculars. ""Humpback, by the looks of it,"" he grunted. ""Big fella. Lost his pod, maybe.""

But there was something off about it. It wasn’t just its size, though it was easily one of the largest I’d ever seen, rivaling the length of some of our smaller tenders. It was its back. It was a roadmap of scars. Not just the usual nicks and scrapes you see from barnacles or minor tussles. These were huge, gouged-out marks, some pale and old, others a more recent, angry pink. Long, tearing slashes, and circular, crater-like depressions. It looked like it had been through a war.

And it was alone. Whales, especially humpbacks, are often social. This one was a solitary giant, a scarred sentinel in the vast, empty ocean. And it was following us. Not just swimming in the same general direction, but actively shadowing our ship. If we adjusted course, it adjusted too, maintaining its position a few hundred yards off our port side. This went on for the rest of the day. Some of the crew found it a novelty, a bit of wildlife to break the tedium. I just found it… unsettling. There was an intelligence in the way it moved, in the occasional roll that brought a massive, dark eye to the surface, seemingly looking right at us.

The second day was the same. The whale was our constant companion. The novelty had worn off for most. Now, it was just… there. A silent, scarred presence. I spent a lot of my off-hours watching it. There was a weird sort of gravity to it. I couldn’t shake the feeling that its presence meant something, though I couldn’t imagine what. The scars on its back fascinated and repulsed me. What could do that to something so immense? A propeller from a massive ship? An orca attack, but on a scale I’d never heard of?

Then, late on the second day of its appearance, something else happened. Our ship started to lose speed. Not drastically at first, just a subtle change in the engine's rhythm, a slight decrease in the vibration underfoot. The Chief Engineer, a perpetually stressed man, was down in the engine room for hours. Word came up that there was some kind of issue with one of the propeller shafts, or maybe a fuel line clog. Nothing critical, they said, but we’d be running at reduced speed for a while, at least until they could isolate the problem.

That’s when the whale’s behavior changed.

It was dusk. The ocean was turning that deep, bruised purple it gets before full night. I was leaning on the rail, watching it. The ship was noticeably slower now, the wake less pronounced. Suddenly, the whale surged forward, closing the distance between us with alarming speed. It dove, then resurfaced right beside the hull, maybe twenty yards out. And then it hit us.

The sound was like a muffled explosion, a deep, resonant THUMP that vibrated through the entire vessel. Metal groaned. I stumbled, grabbing the rail. On the bridge, I heard someone shout.
The whale surfaced again, its scarred back glistening, and then, with a deliberate, powerful thrust of its tail, it slammed its massive body into our hull again. THUMP.

This time, alarms started blaring.
""What in the hell?"" someone yelled from the deck below.
The Captain was on the wing of the bridge, her voice cutting through the sudden chaos. ""All hands, report! What was that?""

The whale hit us a third time. This wasn't a curious nudge. This was an attack. It was ramming us. The impacts were heavy enough to make you think it could actually breach the hull if it hit a weak spot. Panic started to set in. A creature that size, actively hostile… we were a steel ship, sure, but the ocean is a big place, and out here, you’re very much on your own.

A few of the guys, deckhands mostly, grabbed gaff hooks and whatever heavy tools they could find, rushing to the side, yelling, trying to scare it off. The bosun appeared with a flare gun, firing a bright red star over its head. The whale just ignored it, preparing for another run.

""Get the rifles!"" someone shouted. I think it was the Second Mate. ""We need to drive it off!""

I felt a cold knot in my stomach. Shooting it? A whale? It felt monstrously wrong, but it was also ramming a multi-ton steel vessel, and that was just insane. It could cripple us, or worse, damage itself fatally on our hull.

Before anyone could get a clear shot, as a group of crew members gathered with rifles on the deck, the whale suddenly dove. Deep. It vanished into the darkening water as if it had never been there. The immediate assumption was that the show of force, the men lining the rail, had scared it off. We waited, tense, for a long five minutes. Nothing. The ship continued its slow, laborious crawl through the water.

The Captain ordered damage assessments. Miraculously, apart from some scraped paint and a few dented plates above the waterline, our ship seemed okay. But the mood was grim. What if it came back? Why would a whale do that? Rabies? Some weird sickness?

""It's the slowdown,"" The veteran sailor said, his voice low, as he stood beside me later, staring out at the black water. ""Animals can sense weakness. Ship's wounded, moving slow. Maybe it thinks we're easy prey, or dying.""
""Prey?"" I asked. ""It's a baleen whale, isn't it? It eats krill.""
The veteran sailor just shrugged, his weathered face unreadable in the dim deck lights. ""Nature's a strange thing, kid. Out here, anything's possible.""

The engine problems persisted. We were making maybe half our usual speed. Every creak of the ship, every unusual slap of a wave against the hull, had us jumping. The whale didn't reappear for the rest of the night, or so we thought.

My watch came around again in the dead of night, the hours between 2 and 4 a.m. The deck was mostly deserted. The sea was calm, black glass under a star-dusted sky. I was trying to stay alert, scanning the water, my nerves still frayed. And then, I saw it. A faint ripple, then the gleam of a wet back, much closer this time. It was the whale. It had returned, but only when the deck was quiet, when I was, for all intents and purposes, alone.

My heart hammered. I reached for my radio, ready to call it in. But then it did something that made me pause. It didn't charge. It just swam parallel to us, very close, its massive body a dark shadow in the water. It let out a long, low moan, a sound that seemed to vibrate in my bones more than I heard it with my ears. It was an incredibly mournful, almost pained sound. Then, it slowly, deliberately, bumped against the hull. Not a slam, not an attack. A bump. Like a colossal cat rubbing against your leg. Thump. Then another. Thump.

It was the strangest thing. It was looking right at me, I swear it. One huge, dark eye, visible as it rolled slightly. It seemed… I don’t know… desperate? It kept bumping the ship, always on the port side where I stood, always these strange, almost gentle impacts.

I didn’t call it in. I just watched. This wasn’t the aggressive creature from before. This was something else. It continued this for nearly an hour. The moment I saw another crew member, a sleepy-looking engineer on his way to the galley, emerge onto the deck further aft, the whale sank silently beneath the waves and was gone. It was as if it only wanted me to see it, to witness this bizarre, pleading behavior.

The next day, the engineers were still wrestling with the engines. We were still slow. And the whale kept up its strange pattern. During the day, if a crowd was on deck, it stayed away, or if it did approach and men rushed to the rails with shouts or weapons, it would dive and disappear. But if I was alone on deck, or if it was just me and maybe one other person who wasn't paying attention to the water, it would come close. It would start the bumping. Not hard, not damaging, but persistent. Thump… thump… thump… It was eerie. It felt like it was trying to communicate something.

The other crew were mostly convinced it was mad, or that the ship’s vibrations, altered by the engine trouble, were agitating it. The talk of shooting it became more serious. The Captain was hesitant, thankfully. International maritime laws about protected species, but also, I think, a sailor’s reluctance to harm such a creature unless absolutely necessary. Still, rifles were kept ready.

I started to feel a strange connection to it. Those scars… that mournful sound it made when it was just me… It didn’t feel like aggression. It felt like a warning. Or a plea. But for what? I’d stare at its scarred back and wonder again what could inflict such wounds. The gashes looked like they were made by something with immense claws, or teeth that weren't like a shark's. The circular marks were even weirder, almost like suction cups, but grotesquely large, and with torn edges.

The morning it all ended, I was on the dawn watch. The sky was just beginning to lighten in the east, a pale, grey smear. The sea was flat, oily. We were still crawling. The whale was there, off the port side, as usual. It had been quiet for the last few hours, just keeping pace. I felt a profound weariness. Three days of this. Three days of the ship being crippled, three days of this scarred giant shadowing us, its intentions a terrifying enigma.

I remember sipping lukewarm coffee, staring out at the horizon, when I saw the whale react. It suddenly arched its back, its massive tail lifting high out of the water before it brought it down with a tremendous slap. The sound cracked across the quiet morning like a gunshot. Then it dove, a panicked, desperate dive, not the slow, deliberate submergence I was used to. It went straight down, leaving a swirling vortex on the surface.

""What the hell now?"" I muttered, gripping the rail. My eyes scanned the water where it had disappeared. And then I saw it.
Further back, maybe half a mile behind us, something else was on the surface. At first, it was just a disturbance, a dark shape in the grey water. But it was moving fast, incredibly fast, closing the distance to where the whale had been. It wasn't a ship. It wasn't any whale I'd ever seen.

As it got closer, still mostly submerged, I could see its back. It was long, dark, and glistening, but it wasn’t smooth like a whale’s. It had ridges, and… things sticking out of it. Two of them, on either side of its spine, arcing up and then back. They weren’t fins. Not like a shark’s dorsal fin, or a whale’s flippers. They were… they looked like wings. Leathery, membranous wings, like a bat’s, but colossal, and with no feathers, just bare, dark flesh stretched over a bony framework. They weren’t flapping; they were held semi-furled against its back, cutting through the water like grotesque sails. The thing was slicing through the ocean at a speed that made our struggling cargo ship look stationary.

A cold dread, so absolute it was almost paralyzing, seized me. This was what the whale was running from. This was the source of its scars.

The winged thing reached the spot where our whale had dived. It didn't slow. It just… tilted, and slipped beneath the surface without a splash, as if the ocean were a veil it simply passed through.
For a minute, nothing. The sea was calm again. Deceptively so. I was shaking, my coffee cup clattering against the saucer I’d left on the railing. My mind was racing, trying to make sense of what I’d just seen. Flesh wings? In the ocean?

Then, the water began to change color.
Slowly at first, then with horrifying speed, a bloom of red spread outwards from the spot where they’d both gone down. A slick, dark, crimson stain on the grey morning sea. It grew wider and wider.
The whale. Our whale.
I felt sick. A profound sense of horror and, strangely, loss. That scarred giant, with its mournful cries and strange, bumping pleas. It hadn't been trying to hurt us. It had been terrified. It had been trying to get our attention, trying to warn us, maybe even seeking refuge with the only other large thing in that empty stretch of ocean – our ship. And when we slowed down, when we became vulnerable… it must have known we were drawing its hunter closer. Or maybe it was trying to get us to move faster, to escape. The slamming… it was desperate.

The blood slick was vast now, a hideous smear on the calm water. I wanted to look away, but I couldn’t. My crewmates were starting to stir, a few coming out on deck, drawn by the dawn. I heard someone ask, ""What's that? Oil spill?""

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. I was still staring at the bloody water, a good quarter mile astern now as we slowly pulled away. And then, something broke the surface in the middle of it.

It rose slowly, terribly. It wasn't the whale.
First, a section of that ridged, dark back, then those hideous, furled wings of flesh. And then… its head.
Or what passed for a head.
There were no eyes that I could see. No discernible features, really, except for what was clearly its mouth. It was… a hole. A vast, circular maw, big enough to swallow a small car, and it was lined, packed, with rows upon rows of needle-sharp, glistening teeth, some as long as my arm. They weren’t arranged like a shark’s, in neat rows. They were a chaotic forest of ivory daggers, pointing inwards. The flesh around this nightmare orifice was pale and rubbery, like something that had never seen the sun. It just… was. A vertical abyss of teeth, hovering above the bloodstained water.

It wasn’t looking at the ship, not in a general sense. It was higher out of the water than I would have thought possible for something of that bulk without any visible means of buoyancy beyond the slight unfurling of those terrible wings, which seemed to tread water with a slow, obscene power. It rotated, slowly. And then it stopped.

And I knew, with a certainty that froze the marrow in my bones, that it was looking at me.

There were no eyes. I will swear to that until the day I die. There was nothing on that featureless, toothed head that could be called an eye. But I felt its gaze. A cold, ancient, utterly alien regard. It wasn't curious. It wasn't even malevolent, not in a way I could understand. It was like being assessed by a butcher. A focused, chilling attention, right on me, standing there on the deck of our vessel.

Time seemed to stop. The sounds of the ship, the distant chatter of the waking crew, faded away. It was just me, and that… thing, staring at each other across a widening expanse of bloody water. I could feel my heart trying to beat its way out of my chest. I couldn’t breathe.

Then, the Chief Engineer came up beside me, the same one who’d been battling our engine troubles. ""God Almighty,"" he whispered, his face pale. ""What in the name of all that's holy is that?""
The spell broke. The thing didn't react to the Chief. Its focus, if that’s what it was, remained on me for another second or two. Then, with a slow, deliberate movement, it began to sink back beneath the waves, its toothed maw the last thing to disappear into the red.

The Captain was on the bridge wing, binoculars pressed to her eyes, her face a mask of disbelief and horror. Orders were shouted. ""Full power! Get us out of here! Whatever you have to do, Chief, give me everything you've got!""
Suddenly, the engine problem that had plagued us for days seemed… less important. Miraculously, or perhaps spurred by the sheer terror of what we’d just witnessed, the engines roared to life, the ship shuddering as it picked up speed, faster than it had moved in days.

No one spoke for a long time. We just stared back at the bloody patch of water, shrinking in our wake. The silence was heavier than any storm.
The realization hit me fully then, like a physical blow. The whale. The scars. The way it only approached when I was alone, bumping the hull, moaning. It wasn’t trying to hurt us. It was running. It was terrified. It was trying to tell us, trying to warn us. Maybe it even thought our large, metal ship could offer some protection, or that we could help it. When we slowed down, we became a liability, a slow-moving target that might attract its pursuer. Its frantic slamming against the hull when the ship first slowed – it was trying to get us to move, to escape the fate it knew was coming for it. And it had singled me out, for some reason. Maybe I was just the one on watch most often when it was desperate. Maybe it sensed… I don’t know. I don’t want to know.

The rest of the voyage was a blur of hushed conversations, wide eyes, and constant, fearful glances at the ocean. We reported an ""unidentified aggressive marine phenomenon"" and the loss of a whale, but how do you even begin to describe what we saw? Who would believe it? The official log was… sanitized.

We made it to port. I signed off the ship as soon as we docked. I haven’t been back to sea since. I don’t think I ever can.

 I work on cargo ships, long hauls across the empty stretches of ocean. It’s usually monotonous – the endless blue, the thrum of the engines, the routine. But this last trip… this last trip was different.

It started about ten days out from port, somewhere in the Pacific. I was on a late watch, just me and the stars and the hiss of the bow cutting through the water. That’s when I first saw it. A disturbance in the dark water off the port side, too large to be dolphins, too deliberate for a random wave. Then, a plume of mist shot up, illuminated briefly by the deck lights. A whale. Not unheard of, but this one was big. Really big. And it was close.

The next morning, it was still there, keeping pace with us. A few of the other guys spotted it. Our bosun, a weathered old hand on the sea, squinted at it through his binoculars. ""Humpback, by the looks of it,"" he grunted. ""Big fella. Lost his pod, maybe.""

But there was something off about it. It wasn’t just its size, though it was easily one of the largest I’d ever seen, rivaling the length of some of our smaller tenders. It was its back. It was a roadmap of scars. Not just the usual nicks and scrapes you see from barnacles or minor tussles. These were huge, gouged-out marks, some pale and old, others a more recent, angry pink. Long, tearing slashes, and circular, crater-like depressions. It looked like it had been through a war.

And it was alone. Whales, especially humpbacks, are often social. This one was a solitary giant, a scarred sentinel in the vast, empty ocean. And it was following us. Not just swimming in the same general direction, but actively shadowing our ship. If we adjusted course, it adjusted too, maintaining its position a few hundred yards off our port side. This went on for the rest of the day. Some of the crew found it a novelty, a bit of wildlife to break the tedium. I just found it… unsettling. There was an intelligence in the way it moved, in the occasional roll that brought a massive, dark eye to the surface, seemingly looking right at us.

The second day was the same. The whale was our constant companion. The novelty had worn off for most. Now, it was just… there. A silent, scarred presence. I spent a lot of my off-hours watching it. There was a weird sort of gravity to it. I couldn’t shake the feeling that its presence meant something, though I couldn’t imagine what. The scars on its back fascinated and repulsed me. What could do that to something so immense? A propeller from a massive ship? An orca attack, but on a scale I’d never heard of?

Then, late on the second day of its appearance, something else happened. Our ship started to lose speed. Not drastically at first, just a subtle change in the engine's rhythm, a slight decrease in the vibration underfoot. The Chief Engineer, a perpetually stressed man, was down in the engine room for hours. Word came up that there was some kind of issue with one of the propeller shafts, or maybe a fuel line clog. Nothing critical, they said, but we’d be running at reduced speed for a while, at least until they could isolate the problem.

That’s when the whale’s behavior changed.

It was dusk. The ocean was turning that deep, bruised purple it gets before full night. I was leaning on the rail, watching it. The ship was noticeably slower now, the wake less pronounced. Suddenly, the whale surged forward, closing the distance between us with alarming speed. It dove, then resurfaced right beside the hull, maybe twenty yards out. And then it hit us.

The sound was like a muffled explosion, a deep, resonant THUMP that vibrated through the entire vessel. Metal groaned. I stumbled, grabbing the rail. On the bridge, I heard someone shout.
The whale surfaced again, its scarred back glistening, and then, with a deliberate, powerful thrust of its tail, it slammed its massive body into our hull again. THUMP.

This time, alarms started blaring.
""What in the hell?"" someone yelled from the deck below.
The Captain was on the wing of the bridge, her voice cutting through the sudden chaos. ""All hands, report! What was that?""

The whale hit us a third time. This wasn't a curious nudge. This was an attack. It was ramming us. The impacts were heavy enough to make you think it could actually breach the hull if it hit a weak spot. Panic started to set in. A creature that size, actively hostile… we were a steel ship, sure, but the ocean is a big place, and out here, you’re very much on your own.

A few of the guys, deckhands mostly, grabbed gaff hooks and whatever heavy tools they could find, rushing to the side, yelling, trying to scare it off. The bosun appeared with a flare gun, firing a bright red star over its head. The whale just ignored it, preparing for another run.

""Get the rifles!"" someone shouted. I think it was the Second Mate. ""We need to drive it off!""

I felt a cold knot in my stomach. Shooting it? A whale? It felt monstrously wrong, but it was also ramming a multi-ton steel vessel, and that was just insane. It could cripple us, or worse, damage itself fatally on our hull.

Before anyone could get a clear shot, as a group of crew members gathered with rifles on the deck, the whale suddenly dove. Deep. It vanished into the darkening water as if it had never been there. The immediate assumption was that the show of force, the men lining the rail, had scared it off. We waited, tense, for a long five minutes. Nothing. The ship continued its slow, laborious crawl through the water.

The Captain ordered damage assessments. Miraculously, apart from some scraped paint and a few dented plates above the waterline, our ship seemed okay. But the mood was grim. What if it came back? Why would a whale do that? Rabies? Some weird sickness?

""It's the slowdown,"" The veteran sailor said, his voice low, as he stood beside me later, staring out at the black water. ""Animals can sense weakness. Ship's wounded, moving slow. Maybe it thinks we're easy prey, or dying.""
""Prey?"" I asked. ""It's a baleen whale, isn't it? It eats krill.""
The veteran sailor just shrugged, his weathered face unreadable in the dim deck lights. ""Nature's a strange thing, kid. Out here, anything's possible.""

The engine problems persisted. We were making maybe half our usual speed. Every creak of the ship, every unusual slap of a wave against the hull, had us jumping. The whale didn't reappear for the rest of the night, or so we thought.

My watch came around again in the dead of night, the hours between 2 and 4 a.m. The deck was mostly deserted. The sea was calm, black glass under a star-dusted sky. I was trying to stay alert, scanning the water, my nerves still frayed. And then, I saw it. A faint ripple, then the gleam of a wet back, much closer this time. It was the whale.

It was an incredibly mournful, almost pained sound. Then, it slowly, deliberately, bumped against the hull. Not a slam, not an attack. A bump. Like a colossal cat rubbing against your leg. Thump. Then another. Thump.

It was the strangest thing. It was looking right at me, I swear it. One huge, dark eye, visible as it rolled slightly. It seemed… I don’t know… desperate? It kept bumping the ship, always on the port side where I stood, always these strange, almost gentle impacts.

I didn’t call it in. I just watched. This wasn’t the aggressive creature from before. This was something else. It continued this for nearly an hour. The moment I saw another crew member, a sleepy-looking engineer on his way to the galley, emerge onto the deck further aft, the whale sank silently beneath the waves and was gone.

But if I was alone on deck, or if it was just me and maybe one other person who wasn't paying attention to the water, it would come close. It would start the bumping. Not hard, not damaging, but persistent. Thump… thump… thump… It was eerie. It felt like it was trying to communicate something.

The other crew were mostly convinced it was mad, or that the ship’s vibrations, altered by the engine trouble, were agitating it. The talk of shooting it became more serious.

Then, the water began to change color.
Slowly at first, then with horrifying speed, a bloom of red spread outwards from the spot where they’d both gone down. A slick, dark, crimson stain on the grey morning sea. It grew wider and wider.
The whale. Our whale.
I felt sick. A profound sense of horror and, strangely, loss. That scarred giant, with its mournful cries and strange, bumping pleas. It hadn't been trying to hurt us. It had been terrified. It had been trying to get our attention, trying to warn us, maybe even seeking refuge with the only other large thing in that empty stretch of ocean – our ship.

There was a weird sort of gravity to it. I couldn’t shake the feeling that its presence meant something, though I couldn’t imagine what. The scars on its back fascinated and repulsed me. What could do that to something so immense? A propeller from a massive ship? An orca attack, but on a scale I’d never heard of?

Then, late on the second day of its appearance, something else happened. Our ship started to lose speed. Not drastically at first, just a subtle change in the engine's rhythm, a slight decrease in the vibration underfoot. The Chief Engineer, a perpetually stressed man, was down in the engine room for hours. Word came up that there was some kind of issue with one of the propeller shafts, or maybe a fuel line clog. Nothing critical, they said, but we’d be running at reduced speed for a while, at least until they could isolate the problem.

That’s when the whale’s behavior changed.

It was dusk. The ocean was turning that deep, bruised purple it gets before full night. I was leaning on the rail, watching it. The ship was noticeably slower now, the wake less pronounced. Suddenly, the whale surged forward, closing the distance between us with alarming speed. It dove, then resurfaced right beside the hull, maybe twenty yards out. And then it hit us.

The sound was like a muffled explosion, a deep, resonant THUMP that vibrated through the entire vessel. Metal groaned. I stumbled, grabbing the rail. On the bridge, I heard someone shout.
The whale surfaced again, its scarred back glistening, and then, with a deliberate, powerful thrust of its tail, it slammed its massive body into our hull again. THUMP.

This time, alarms started blaring.
""What in the hell?"" someone yelled from the deck below.
The Captain was on the wing of the bridge, her voice cutting through the sudden chaos. ""All hands, report! What was that?""

The whale hit us a third time. This wasn't a curious nudge. This was an attack. It was ramming us. The impacts were heavy enough to make you think it could actually breach the hull if it hit a weak spot. Panic started to set in. A creature that size, actively hostile… we were a steel ship, sure, but the ocean is a big place, and out here, you’re very much on your own.

A few of the guys, deckhands mostly, grabbed gaff hooks and whatever heavy tools they could find, rushing to the side, yelling, trying to scare it off. The bosun appeared with a flare gun, firing a bright red star over its head. The whale just ignored it, preparing for another run.

""Get the rifles!"" someone shouted. I think it was the Second Mate. ""We need to drive it off!""

I felt a cold knot in my stomach. Shooting it? A whale? It felt monstrously wrong, but it was also ramming a multi-ton steel vessel, and that was just insane. It could cripple us, or worse, damage itself fatally on our hull.

Before anyone could get a clear shot, as a group of crew members gathered with rifles on the deck, the whale suddenly dove. Deep. It vanished into the darkening water as if it had never been there. The immediate assumption was that the show of force, the men lining the rail, had scared it off. We waited, tense, for a long five minutes. Nothing. The ship continued its slow, laborious crawl through the water.

The Captain ordered damage assessments. Miraculously, apart from some scraped paint and a few dented plates above the waterline, our ship seemed okay. But the mood was grim. What if it came back? Why would a whale do that? Rabies? Some weird sickness?

""It's the slowdown,"" The veteran sailor said, his voice low, as he stood beside me later, staring out at the black water. ""Animals can sense weakness. Ship's wounded, moving slow. Maybe it thinks we're easy prey, or dying.""
""Prey?"" I asked. ""It's a baleen whale, isn't it? It eats krill.""
The veteran sailor just shrugged, his weathered face unreadable in the dim deck lights. ""Nature's a strange thing, kid. Out here, anything's possible.""

The engine problems persisted. We were making maybe half our usual speed. Every creak of the ship, every unusual slap of a wave against the hull, had us jumping. The whale didn't reappear for the rest of the night, or so we thought.

My watch came around again in the dead of night, the hours between 2 and 4 a.m. The deck was mostly deserted. The sea was calm, black glass under a star-dusted sky. I was trying to stay alert, scanning the water, my nerves still frayed. And then, I saw it. A faint ripple, then the gleam of a wet back, much closer this time. It was the whale. It had returned, but only when the deck was quiet, when I was, for all intents and purposes, alone.

My heart hammered. I reached for my radio, ready to call it in. But then it did something that made me pause. It didn't charge. It just swam parallel to us, very close, its massive body a dark shadow in the water. It let out a long, low moan, a sound that seemed to vibrate in my bones more than I heard it with my ears. It was an incredibly mournful, almost pained sound. Then, it slowly, deliberately, bumped against the hull. Not a slam, not an attack. A bump. Like a colossal cat rubbing against your leg. Thump. Then another. Thump.

It was the strangest thing. It was looking right at me, I swear it. One huge, dark eye, visible as it rolled slightly. It seemed… I don’t know… desperate? It kept bumping the ship, always on the port side where I stood, always these strange, almost gentle impacts.

I didn’t call it in. I just watched. This wasn’t the aggressive creature from before. This was something else. It continued this for nearly an hour. The moment I saw another crew member, a sleepy-looking engineer on his way to the galley, emerge onto the deck further aft, the whale sank silently beneath the waves and was gone. It was as if it only wanted me to see it, to witness this bizarre, pleading behavior.

The next day, the engineers were still wrestling with the engines. We were still slow. And the whale kept up its strange pattern. During the day, if a crowd was on deck, it stayed away, or if it did approach and men rushed to the rails with shouts or weapons, it would dive and disappear. But if I was alone on deck, or if it was just me and maybe one other person who wasn't paying attention to the water, it would come close. It would start the bumping. Not hard, not damaging, but persistent. Thump… thump… thump… It was eerie. It felt like it was trying to communicate something.

The other crew were mostly convinced it was mad, or that the ship’s vibrations, altered by the engine trouble, were agitating it. The talk of shooting it became more serious. The Captain was hesitant, thankfully. International maritime laws about protected species, but also, I think, a sailor’s reluctance to harm such a creature unless absolutely necessary. Still, rifles were kept ready.

I started to feel a strange connection to it. Those scars… that mournful sound it made when it was just me… It didn’t feel like aggression. It felt like a warning. Or a plea. But for what? I’d stare at its scarred back and wonder again what could inflict such wounds. The gashes looked like they were made by something with immense claws, or teeth that weren't like a shark's. The circular marks were even weirder, almost like suction cups, but grotesquely large, and with torn edges.

The morning it all ended, I was on the dawn watch. The sky was just beginning to lighten in the east, a pale, grey smear. The sea was flat, oily. We were still crawling. The whale was there, off the port side, as usual. It had been quiet for the last few hours, just keeping pace. I felt a profound weariness. Three days of this. Three days of the ship being crippled, three days of this scarred giant shadowing us, its intentions a terrifying enigma.

I remember sipping lukewarm coffee, staring out at the horizon, when I saw the whale react. It suddenly arched its back, its massive tail lifting high out of the water before it brought it down with a tremendous slap. The sound cracked across the quiet morning like a gunshot. Then it dove, a panicked, desperate dive, not the slow, deliberate submergence I was used to. It went straight down, leaving a swirling vortex on the surface.

""What the hell now?"" I muttered, gripping the rail. My eyes scanned the water where it had disappeared. And then I saw it.
Further back, maybe half a mile behind us, something else was on the surface. At first, it was just a disturbance, a dark shape in the grey water. But it was moving fast, incredibly fast, closing the distance to where the whale had been. It wasn't a ship. It wasn't any whale I'd ever seen.

As it got closer, still mostly submerged, I could see its back. It was long, dark, and glistening, but it wasn’t smooth like a whale’s. It had ridges, and… things sticking out of it. Two of them, on either side of its spine, arcing up and then back. They weren’t fins. Not like a shark’s dorsal fin, or a whale’s flippers. They were… they looked like wings. Leathery, membranous wings, like a bat’s, but colossal, and with no feathers, just bare, dark flesh stretched over a bony framework. They weren’t flapping; they were held semi-furled against its back, cutting through the water like grotesque sails. The thing was slicing through the ocean at a speed that made our struggling cargo ship look stationary.

A cold dread, so absolute it was almost paralyzing, seized me. This was what the whale was running from. This was the source of its scars.

The winged thing reached the spot where our whale had dived. It didn't slow. It just… tilted, and slipped beneath the surface without a splash, as if the ocean were a veil it simply passed through.
For a minute, nothing. The sea was calm again. Deceptively so. I was shaking, my coffee cup clattering against the saucer I’d left on the railing. My mind was racing, trying to make sense of what I’d just seen. Flesh wings? In the ocean?

Then, the water began to change color.
Slowly at first, then with horrifying speed, a bloom of red spread outwards from the spot where they’d both gone down. A slick, dark, crimson stain on the grey morning sea. It grew wider and wider.
The whale. Our whale.
I felt sick. A profound sense of horror and, strangely, loss. That scarred giant, with its mournful cries and strange, bumping pleas. It hadn't been trying to hurt us. It had been terrified. It had been trying to get our attention, trying to warn us, maybe even seeking refuge with the only other large thing in that empty stretch of ocean – our ship. And when we slowed down, when we became vulnerable… it must have known we were drawing its hunter closer. Or maybe it was trying to get us to move faster, to escape. The slamming… it was desperate.

The blood slick was vast now, a hideous smear on the calm water. I wanted to look away, but I couldn’t. My crewmates were starting to stir, a few coming out on deck, drawn by the dawn. I heard someone ask, ""What's that? Oil spill?""

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. I was still staring at the bloody water, a good quarter mile astern now as we slowly pulled away. And then, something broke the surface in the middle of it.

It rose slowly, terribly. It wasn't the whale.
First, a section of that ridged, dark back, then those hideous, furled wings of flesh. And then… its head.
Or what passed for a head.
There were no eyes that I could see. No discernible features, really, except for what was clearly its mouth. It was… a hole. A vast, circular maw, big enough to swallow a small car, and it was lined, packed, with rows upon rows of needle-sharp, glistening teeth, some as long as my arm. They weren’t arranged like a shark’s, in neat rows. They were a chaotic forest of ivory daggers, pointing inwards. The flesh around this nightmare orifice was pale and rubbery, like something that had never seen the sun. It just… was. A vertical abyss of teeth, hovering above the bloodstained water.

It wasn’t looking at the ship, not in a general sense. It was higher out of the water than I would have thought possible for something of that bulk without any visible means of buoyancy beyond the slight unfurling of those terrible wings, which seemed to tread water with a slow, obscene power. It rotated, slowly. And then it stopped.

And I knew, with a certainty that froze the marrow in my bones, that it was looking at me.

There were no eyes. I will swear to that until the day I die. There was nothing on that featureless, toothed head that could be called an eye. But I felt its gaze. A cold, ancient, utterly alien regard. It wasn't curious. It wasn't even malevolent, not in a way I could understand. It was like being assessed by a butcher. A focused, chilling attention, right on me, standing there on the deck of our vessel.

Time seemed to stop. The sounds of the ship, the distant chatter of the waking crew, faded away. It was just me, and that… thing, staring at each other across a widening expanse of bloody water. I could feel my heart trying to beat its way out of my chest. I couldn’t breathe.

Then, the Chief Engineer came up beside me, the same one who’d been battling our engine troubles. ""God Almighty,"" he whispered, his face pale. ""What in the name of all that's holy is that?""
The spell broke. The thing didn't react to the Chief. Its focus, if that’s what it was, remained on me for another second or two. Then, with a slow, deliberate movement, it began to sink back beneath the waves, its toothed maw the last thing to disappear into the red.

The Captain was on the bridge wing, binoculars pressed to her eyes, her face a mask of disbelief and horror. Orders were shouted. ""Full power! Get us out of here! Whatever you have to do, Chief, give me everything you've got!""
Suddenly, the engine problem that had plagued us for days seemed… less important. Miraculously, or perhaps spurred by the sheer terror of what we’d just witnessed, the engines roared to life, the ship shuddering as it picked up speed, faster than it had moved in days.

No one spoke for a long time. We just stared back at the bloody patch of water, shrinking in our wake. The silence was heavier than any storm.
The realization hit me fully then, like a physical blow. The whale. The scars. The way it only approached when I was alone, bumping the hull, moaning. It wasn’t trying to hurt us. It was running. It was terrified. It was trying to tell us, trying to warn us. Maybe it even thought our large, metal ship could offer some protection, or that we could help it. When we slowed down, we became a liability, a slow-moving target that might attract its pursuer. Its frantic slamming against the hull when the ship first slowed – it was trying to get us to move, to escape the fate it knew was coming for it. And it had singled me out, for some reason. Maybe I was just the one on watch most often when it was desperate. Maybe it sensed… I don’t know. I don’t want to know.

The rest of the voyage was a blur of hushed conversations, wide eyes, and constant, fearful glances at the ocean. We reported an ""unidentified aggressive marine phenomenon"" and the loss of a whale, but how do you even begin to describe what we saw? Who would believe it? The official log was… sanitized.

We made it to port. I signed off the ship as soon as we docked. I haven’t been back to sea since. I don’t think I ever can.

I started rewatching the series while waiting to see Bloodlines and I realized something about the first movie - only when Alex thinks or talks about death do the deaths occur

1. he has the vision on the plane, and is arguing later with Carter about his vision and the plane explodes  
  
2. after being reminded of the deaths at the school memorial THIRTY-NINE (39) DAYS LATER, Alex is once again forced to think about the deaths...and then Tod dies

3. after talking to Bludworth, Alex and Clear go to a coffee shop to talk about what they learned (death!) and Terry gets hit by the bus  
  
4. Alex sees the news report about the path of the explosion, causing him to draw up his diagram and Ms. Lewton dies

5. after Carter tries to cheat death on the train tracks, and after Alex saves him and has death on the mind, Billy is killed  
  
6. then Alex decides to hide in the woods. Time clearly passes. only when he realizes that he never switched seats does death go after Clear  
  
7. again, more time passes and the trio (Alex, Clear, and Carter) are in Paris. Only after Alex brings up his diagram of the explosion and starts talking about the place again does death come for them. First Alex, but when he's saved it goes for Carter.

My point? Alex is responsible for the deaths. I feel like if he hadn't freaked out on the plane in the first place, it never would have crashed and led to the following events of the movie.

1ksw6gi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1ksw6gi/hi_im_under_the_age_of_18_but_i_hope_this_post/,"Hi. I’m under the age of 18, but I hope this post can be of help to people who suffer from: OCD excessive hand washing, Anxiety, Depersonalization, and Derealization or for anyone feeling unworthy.","Quick Fact: OCD can be passed down genetically from parent to child, and that’s how I found someone close in my family who went through the same thing. Since then I have talked with them and they’ve helped me a lot.

I did enough research about OCD, Anxiety and DP/DPR, which aided a lot in helping me to this point.

I also searched up a lot of reddit forums while I was helping myself. This post also might be poorly written so excuse that please.😭

Here’s a reddit forum that helped me and recommended me videos: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/ye59u4/had_frequent_dpdr_episodes_for_about_7_months_and/
Yes, it’s under DPR. Username is: HalfVenezuelan. 

Now, let’s address OCD Excessive Handwashing first. You need to accept germs are gonna be everywhere, you need to adapt to touching stuff if it has nothing on it despite having the mindset that someone who didn’t wash their hands probably touched it.

Fast Forward, that’s where anxiety comes into play. Anxiety fuels the worrisome, intrusive thoughts that you are thinking about even more, which then causes you to perform handwashing rituals. STOP….that…Immediately because once you can’t carry out that entire handwashing ritual you’ll be anxious. 

To add on to it, DP/DPR makes everything worst. I had symptoms of DP/DPR because of my phone, I was scrolling all day, watching TikTok for 2 hours, Youtube for 1 hour, and just stress overall. 

Quick catch up: What does DPR/DP have to do with excessive hand washing? Good question, I’ll answer that for you. 

Since I didn’t feel real, or, in my body, I wasn’t able to remember anything. Then to add on to that, I was distracted constantly by my phone which affected my attention span leading me to not be able to fully focus during the entire time I was washing my hands for.

After I was done washing my hands, I would ask myself “Did I wash my hands?”. And you know what that led to me doing? Washing my hands excessively, over, again and again to the point my hands were cracked bleeding.

To curb that, I got Jergen Skin Firming Lotion after trying the Billie Unscented Lotion that made my hands feel as if I didn’t put anything on them to begin with.

Ok, Next thing I will explain is the techniques I used to stop all of this.

For DP/DPR, I downloaded these apps called Headspace, Medito, and Breathwrk. I already knew Andy from Headspace since a child, and his voice would help me a lot.

DP/DPR is all about you not feeling yourself in your body or if life is real, you need grounding exercises for that. Put on a session from the first two apps, sit back, relax, close your eyelids, and breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Acknowledge the noise in your surroundings, scan your body and relax each body part one by one, Graze your fingertips against each other a couple of times and focus back on your breathing. 

Do that everyday for a couple minutes, Make sure you DO NOT get on your phone for the first 30 minutes after you have woke up. That’s gonna ruin your whole mental and cause you to only be focused on your phone.
Delete your TikTok app, or log out then hide the app and if you want to spend time on TikTok, set a timer for 10 minutes and renew it 3-5 times.

Now, on to anxiety and obsessive thoughts.
When you wash your hands and don’t remember after doing so and you ask yourself “Did I wash my hands?” Do you know what that’s called? It’s called Rumination. 

Rumination: A deep or considered thought about something. 

Here’s an example: I made sure I washed my hands before touching my phone after throwing out garbage, but i don’t remember washing my hands? Don’t I always count while washing my hands? So is my phone dirty now? Did I touch my phone before washing my hands? 

Now, that you’ve seen an example of ruminating, which happens and gets fueled by Anxiety you can now use this technique of thinking to stop it all.

The technique is the words: 

“Maybe I didn’t, or Maybe I did.”
then shrug that shit off.

Here’s the video that’ll explain things better than me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U9DGeT8OPw
In case the link doesn’t work, it’s by OCD and Anxiety and the name of the video is called “Rumination and OCD | How to stop!”


Ok, now let’s say we get to the sink and we’re about to wash our hands. You need to start explaining what you’re doing aloud, to yourself, in first person, E.G. “Ok, I gotta get soap, then I gotta turn on the water, now I gotta count and wash my hands.”

Now the actual handwashing part and memory.

You need to learn to trust yourself and that you have washed your hands. Also, using environmental cues to help.

Like for example: If music is playing while you are washing your hands track and see if you started at the beginning of the song and if the song is now ending to help you remember that you washed your hands.

Another technique, can be singing a song 3 times, opposed to numbers which you can easily lose track of.

Technique 2# Put all your focus on your voice while counting to remember that you washed your hands. E.G. “1, and 2, and 3, and 4, and 5”

Technique 3# Try playing memory games to help you build trust of your memory, or if you are passing by stuff try to remember a coffee shop name or a license plate, or a phone number.

Technique 4# While counting, you can visual in your head, the numbers in groups of 3 and 2 one by one as you’re counting or look in the mirror while counting to remember.


Back to grounding techniques, while washing your hands. Just rub and try to feel your hands, the soap, the water, and the air when you shake your hands of to dry them.

Technique 5# Smelling the soap off your hands or sometimes the soap residue doesn’t come completely off so if you rub your hands soap is still on there, AKA more disinfecting and a indicator that you washed your hands.

Technique 6# Explain your situation to someone close by and have them help you keep track of washing your hands or counting for you.

As I mentioned, up there about grounding techniques while you are doing the meditation sessions try to not think about anything and silence the thoughts by focusing only on the voice playing from the meditation app.

Conclusion:

Are you gonna regress sometime down the line? Probably, but that doesn’t mean you have to let it push you back, as long as you use a change of thinking to address it.

I also wanted to mention that the person that had OCD previously that helped me is a really clean person and what caused all this in the first place was having to pee in really nasty bathrooms with poop all over the wall.


I have long hair so that doesn’t help, but I am gonna be cutting my hair so that makes everything better.


I’ll be happy to answer any question’s.

I hope this helps you.
Remember, everything is gonna be alright. 

I love you, take care.🩷🩷

1ksw5um,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ksw5um,Please give me your honest thoughts about this blue chair,"Because I hate it. Everyone else loves it!

It’s far bigger than I wanted (my fault, I think they ordered the deep seat and I missed it). The color isn’t what I was expecting - in the store lights, the velvet was a darker, richer blue, but of course when sat in front of natural light, the velvet is a different color. It was customer upholstery so can’t be returned. 

My room is large and it doesn’t feel too large for my space, I don’t think. But right now it just looks like a big blue box. 

NOTE: I obviously don’t have pillows, art, lamps etc, so maybe if I pull some of the blue into those, it’ll feel more cohesive? 

I’m also getting a dark leather ottoman so that coffee table isn’t staying. 

The alternative is I put this chair in a different room and opt for a smaller swivel chair that’s neutral in color (grey? Brown? There’s some purple-brown in my rug). But we wanted this room to feel cozy, and it’s definitely a big cozy chair. 

If you think it works for the space and I’m crazy, please let me know. I need to learn to love it.

1ksw5pu,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1ksw5pu/baby_boxes/,Baby boxes!,"Let’s talk about free baby boxes!!!! I have ordered and received baby boxes from Amazon, Target, Babylist, and Walmart. I will add photos in comments, and a list from each so everyone can get an idea of what is included, so you can decide if you’d like to also get one 🙂 From my understanding, they should be about the same every month, with very slight variations. is there any other places you would recommend? (Sorry if someone already posted something like this!) Please note, I am located in the United States!


AMAZON - (first two photos)
To redeem: must have Amazon Prime, add 10 unique items to your baby registry, make a purchase of $10 from your registry (you or someone else can), then you can claim the box! It is free shipping.  I ordered the box on 4/18, and received it 4/26. 
I personally did this one right away once I found out I was pregnant. I just ordered some baby-safe laundry detergent and dryer sheets from my registry to get it activated.

It Included:
-one Swaddle Designs organic bodysuit, size 3 months (mine was mint green)
-one Amazing Baby newborn muslin swaddle (also a mint green color)
-pack of 1 Pampers pure diaper, size 1
-one Bright Starts perfect pair teether toy, 3 months+ (coffee and donut)-one Dr. Brown’s anti-colic bottle, 0+ months 
-one Philips bottle
-two Aquaphor sample size (.14 oz) baby healing ointment 
-one Palmer’s 2 step sample size skin therapy oil (.68 fl oz) and stretch marks lotion (.68 fl oz)
-a pamphlet about Amazon’s baby registry with some guides and checklists inside 

Coupons included:
-up to 10 free meals + first box ships free from Hello Fresh 
-up to $130 off from Factor
-20% off Dr. Nozebest bot 

*overall, I would say It is worth it if you have Prime! It is a smaller box, but you only have to spend $10 off your registry to get the free box with free shipping.



TARGET - (third photo)
To redeem: must be a Target Circle member (free), create a baby registry, add at least 10 items to your registry, purchase over $10 from your registry (you or someone else), allow 48 hours for the coupon to be issued to your account. Depending on where you live, you can redeem the coupon in store at the guest services counter for free, or order online and pay for shipping. From reading reddit, it sounds like most locations do not have it in stock at the store, so online may be easiest. Shipping was $5.99. I ordered the box on 4/29, and received it 5/2.
I added Palmers Mother/baby kit and prenatal to my registry and ordered those to reach the minimum, and minimum required for free shipping. 

It included:
-all items in a cute reusable target bag
-pack of 2 Millie Moon diapers, size 1
-pack of 1 Pampers pure diaper, size 1
-pack of 2 Up&Up diapers, size 1
-pack of 10 Honest wipes
-pack of 20 Up&Up wipes
-sample pack of Lansinoh nursing pad and breastmilk storage bag
-one Dr. Brown’s anti-colic bottle, 0+ months
-one Philips bottle
-one Bibs pacifier
-one Dapple Baby sample size (.45 oz) bottle and dish soap
-one Aveeno sample size (.5 oz) newborn balm
-one Mommy’s Bliss sample size (.17 oz) gripe water
-one Up&Up sample size (.34 oz) dreamy lavender baby lotion
-one Up&Up sample size (.34 oz) dreamy lavender shampoo & baby wash
-two Kendamil sample size (.76 oz) instant formula
*Unfortunately, the Kendamil formula samples expire on 10/29/25, which my due date is 10/28, so these are basically useless for me. I have tried to call Target multiple times and they cannot provide a solution besides going in-store. But as I mentioned before, the store locations near me do not carry baby boxes, so they are unable to exchange the formula samples. I will donate what I received of course. 

Coupons included:
-Save $1 on any full size Dapple product

*overall, this one had a nice variety of items. I was not as excited as I was with the Amazon box. you have to spend $10 minimum (off registry, and then free if you can find a store location with some boxes in stock). Or you can be like me and order everything online, and try to get free shipping (min $35 purchase for free shipping). So you have to spend minimum $41 ($35 min for free shipping and other items to activate the coupon, and then $5.99 to ship the actual box). If you plan to buy a few items from target anyways, this is worth the extra $6 to get.



BABYLIST - (fourth and fifth photos) 
To redeem: must create a Babylist registry, add 3 items from other stores, complete 40% of your registry checklist, make a minimum purchase of $30 from the Babylist shop (you or someone else can), and then order the box! Shipping was $8.95. I ordered the box on 4/29, and received it 5/7.
I ordered a few bath essentials and some clearance clothes. The items must be sold through Babylist specifically, which is a little limited, and the prices are higher than other stores. I ordered enough to get free shipping ($45 minimum purchase). I got a clearance outfit, clearance set of onesies, bath thermometer, and Frida control the flow rinser.

It included:
-one Kyte brand bamboo onesie, size 0-3 months (mind had a hedgehog print) 
-one Primary brand onesie, size 3-6 months (mind had a rainbow and sun print)
-one Stonyfield organic Yobaby bib (white and orange)
-one Beaufort Bonnet Company burp cloth (white with polka dots)
-pack of 3 Huggies skin essentials diapers, size 1
-pack of 2 Healthybaby diapers, size 1
-pack of 10 Waterwipes
-pack of 10 Honest wipes
-pack of 25 Ubbi baby wipes
-sample pack of Lansinoh nursing pad and breastmilk storage bag
-one Mom Cozy breast milk storage bag
-one Dr. Brown’s anti-colic bottle, 0+ months
-one Philips bottle
-one Suavinex silicone pacifier, size 0-6 months
-one Bibs pacifier
-one Lansinoh sample size (.05 oz) nipple balm
-one Tubby Todd sample size (.17 oz) all over ointment
-one Palmer’s sample size (.66 fl oz) stretch marks massage lotion
-one Kinder Care bath essentials sample size newborn 2-1 hair & body wash (.5 fl oz) and super soft lotion (.5 fl oz)
-two Triple Paste samples (.21 oz each)

Coupons included:
-10 free birth announcements from Shutterfly
-free swaddle from Little Unicorn (must pay for shipping, $8.49. Each swaddle is about $20-$30)
-free bodysuit from Colored Organics (up to $15 value, must pay for shipping, $5.00)
-free month and spring from TinyBeans ($28 value)
-free yogurt from Yobaby Organic - must pay for shipping
-20% off first purchase from Beaufort Bonnet Company
-20% off first sleep bag purchase - so sorry, I could not see where this one was from based on my pics!
-free can of Bobbie formula - must pay for shipping, $7.95. Original price was $25.00)
-save $2.00 off any one Triple Paste diaper rash cream

*I did get the free Little Unicorn swaddle and bodysuit from Colored Organics just to see, which are both nice quality. For the price of shipping, I think it was good. I also got the Bobbie formula as a backup, since I plan to breastfeed. Overall, I found that these three were decent coupons. I would not have purchased these items otherwise.
*I personally am not huge on using the coupons, so I threw most out or gave away. Unfortunately, I got rid of them before deciding to post this, so there are a few that I cannot remember that were included, and can’t fully tell based on the pictures, sorry!)
*overall, this box had a great variety of stuff and I think the most. You have to spend the most money to receive it, and it you have to buy items that are more expensive than from other locations in order to reach the $35 minimum. If you shop in the clearance, and spend just a few more dollars on some necessities, it may be worth it! I personally found it was worth it, and I was the very excited opening this box.



WALMART - (last two photos)
To redeem: create a Walmart baby registry, ensure it has been active for at least seven days, add a minimum of 20 items to the registry, purchase at least $25 from the registry (by you or others), then order the box! It is free shipping. I ordered the box on 5/8, and received it 5/21. 
I put a bunch of random things on my registry to help reach the minimum, as well as minimum required for free shipping ($35), and it worked! I got a heating pad, laundry dryer sheets, a clearance baby snow suit, and the Fridababy skinsoother. 

It included:
-Walmart pamphlet that has a list of must-haves and help with a baby checklist
-a pocketbook to keep track of the feeding schedule, and includes feeding information
-three pack of Carter’s white bodysuits, size newborn
-one Gerber baby pouch, good for in the hospital bag or diaper bag! (Mine was pink/orange/white/brown striped)
-two pack of Gerber modern moments wet/dry bags
-pack of 3 Huggies skin essentials diapers, size 1
-pack of 6 Pampers wipes
-pack of 24 Huggies wipes
-pack of 10 Honest wipes
-pack of 10 Water wipes
-one Dr. Brown’s anti-colic bottle, 0+ months
-one Tommee Tippee bottle, 0+ months
-one Aquaphor sample size (.14 oz) baby healing ointment
-one Enfamil sample size(2 fl oz) instant formula
-one Kendamil sample size (.76 oz) instant formula
*Unfortunately, I had the same issue with the formulas. the Kendamil formula sample expires on 10/29/25, and the Enfamil formula sample expires 10/30. I tried to call Walmart, and the gentleman could not locate the order to issue an exchange since it technically was a free box. I have not tried to go in-store yet, but I will update the in the comments once I try. I will donate what I received of course, if I cannot exchange. 

*overall, I loved this box. It had a great variety of items, and a few newer items I hadn’t seen in other boxes. Walmart has great prices, so I think it’s easy to get a lot of items to reach the minimum. I found it worth it!! Especially if you were going to buy anything from Walmart!



OVERALL, I LOVE getting the boxes! I did not try out many coupons (yet), but the small samples of products are great for diaper bags, and I have a nice start on bottles already! Do you have any more recommendations?

1ksw5dr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Depersonalization/comments/1ksw5dr/hi_im_under_the_age_of_18_but_i_hope_this_post/,"Hi. I’m under the age of 18, but I hope this post can be of help to people who suffer from: OCD excessive hand washing, Anxiety, Depersonalization, and Derealization or for anyone feeling unworthy.","Quick Fact: OCD can be passed down genetically from parent to child, and that’s how I found someone close in my family who went through the same thing. Since then I have talked with them and they’ve helped me a lot.

I did enough research about OCD, Anxiety and DP/DPR, which aided a lot in helping me to this point.

I also searched up a lot of reddit forums while I was helping myself. This post also might be poorly written so excuse that please.😭

Here’s a reddit forum that helped me and recommended me videos: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/ye59u4/had_frequent_dpdr_episodes_for_about_7_months_and/
Yes, it’s under DPR. Username is: HalfVenezuelan. 

Now, let’s address OCD Excessive Handwashing first. You need to accept germs are gonna be everywhere, you need to adapt to touching stuff if it has nothing on it despite having the mindset that someone who didn’t wash their hands probably touched it.

Fast Forward, that’s where anxiety comes into play. Anxiety fuels the worrisome, intrusive thoughts that you are thinking about even more, which then causes you to perform handwashing rituals. STOP….that…Immediately because once you can’t carry out that entire handwashing ritual you’ll be anxious. 

To add on to it, DP/DPR makes everything worst. I had symptoms of DP/DPR because of my phone, I was scrolling all day, watching TikTok for 2 hours, Youtube for 1 hour, and just stress overall. 

Quick catch up: What does DPR/DP have to do with excessive hand washing? Good question, I’ll answer that for you. 

Since I didn’t feel real, or, in my body, I wasn’t able to remember anything. Then to add on to that, I was distracted constantly by my phone which affected my attention span leading me to not be able to fully focus during the entire time I was washing my hands for.

After I was done washing my hands, I would ask myself “Did I wash my hands?”. And you know what that led to me doing? Washing my hands excessively, over, again and again to the point my hands were cracked bleeding.

To curb that, I got Jergen Skin Firming Lotion after trying the Billie Unscented Lotion that made my hands feel as if I didn’t put anything on them to begin with.

Ok, Next thing I will explain is the techniques I used to stop all of this.

For DP/DPR, I downloaded these apps called Headspace, Medito, and Breathwrk. I already knew Andy from Headspace since a child, and his voice would help me a lot.

DP/DPR is all about you not feeling yourself in your body or if life is real, you need grounding exercises for that. Put on a session from the first two apps, sit back, relax, close your eyelids, and breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Acknowledge the noise in your surroundings, scan your body and relax each body part one by one, Graze your fingertips against each other a couple of times and focus back on your breathing. 

Do that everyday for a couple minutes, Make sure you DO NOT get on your phone for the first 30 minutes after you have woke up. That’s gonna ruin your whole mental and cause you to only be focused on your phone.
Delete your TikTok app, or log out then hide the app and if you want to spend time on TikTok, set a timer for 10 minutes and renew it 3-5 times.

Now, on to anxiety and obsessive thoughts.
When you wash your hands and don’t remember after doing so and you ask yourself “Did I wash my hands?” Do you know what that’s called? It’s called Rumination. 

Rumination: A deep or considered thought about something. 

Here’s an example: I made sure I washed my hands before touching my phone after throwing out garbage, but i don’t remember washing my hands? Don’t I always count while washing my hands? So is my phone dirty now? Did I touch my phone before washing my hands? 

Now, that you’ve seen an example of ruminating, which happens and gets fueled by Anxiety you can now use this technique of thinking to stop it all.

The technique is the words: 

“Maybe I didn’t, or Maybe I did.”
then shrug that shit off.

Here’s the video that’ll explain things better than me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U9DGeT8OPw
In case the link doesn’t work, it’s by OCD and Anxiety and the name of the video is called “Rumination and OCD | How to stop!”


Ok, now let’s say we get to the sink and we’re about to wash our hands. You need to start explaining what you’re doing aloud, to yourself, in first person, E.G. “Ok, I gotta get soap, then I gotta turn on the water, now I gotta count and wash my hands.”

Now the actual handwashing part and memory.

You need to learn to trust yourself and that you have washed your hands. Also, using environmental cues to help.

Like for example: If music is playing while you are washing your hands track and see if you started at the beginning of the song and if the song is now ending to help you remember that you washed your hands.

Another technique, can be singing a song 3 times, opposed to numbers which you can easily lose track of.

Technique 2# Put all your focus on your voice while counting to remember that you washed your hands. E.G. “1, and 2, and 3, and 4, and 5”

Technique 3# Try playing memory games to help you build trust of your memory, or if you are passing by stuff try to remember a coffee shop name or a license plate, or a phone number.

Technique 4# While counting, you can visual in your head, the numbers in groups of 3 and 2 one by one as you’re counting or look in the mirror while counting to remember.


Back to grounding techniques, while washing your hands. Just rub and try to feel your hands, the soap, the water, and the air when you shake your hands of to dry them.

Technique 5# Smelling the soap off your hands or sometimes the soap residue doesn’t come completely off so if you rub your hands soap is still on there, AKA more disinfecting and a indicator that you washed your hands.

Technique 6# Explain your situation to someone close by and have them help you keep track of washing your hands or counting for you.

As I mentioned, up there about grounding techniques while you are doing the meditation sessions try to not think about anything and silence the thoughts by focusing only on the voice playing from the meditation app.

Conclusion:

Are you gonna regress sometime down the line? Probably, but that doesn’t mean you have to let it push you back, as long as you use a change of thinking to address it.

I also wanted to mention that the person that had OCD previously that helped me is a really clean person and what caused all this in the first place was having to pee in really nasty bathrooms with poop all over the wall.


I have long hair so that doesn’t help, but I am gonna be cutting my hair so that makes everything better.


I’ll be happy to answer any question’s.

I hope this helps you.
Remember, everything is gonna be alright. 

I love you, take care.🩷🩷

She chased me for months, even after I told her I wasn’t interested in being in a relationship with anyone. We ended up dating for a year and a half.

When she recently reached out after seeing a bunch of our old memories on Snapchat, she told me she had started to resent me back then. She said it was because I didn’t put in any effort while she was constantly the one pursuing me, even though I did put in effort throughout our actual relationship.

She also said that I only started to really see her once she made it clear she wanted to be physical. I was her first, and she was mine. At the time, I thought she only wanted that to get over me, but after it happened, I realized I was actually in love with her. I also felt regretful for not asking her to be my girlfriend before we got physical. I had planned to ask, but she ended up asking me first. Of course, I said yes.

Before that, when she had asked multiple times about being together, I told her I just wanted to be friends. That was before we got physical. But once that happened, I felt like I was madly in love with her.

I’ve had women approach me before, but never anyone who fought for me like she did. It’s crazy because I ended up in the position girls are usually in, being the one who’s chased.

She also pointed out how her new boyfriend plans every single date, while I never did that when we were first talking. She mentioned how she always had to ask me to hang out and how I would often cancel. Now, her new boyfriend plans big, thoughtful dates and things like that.

Then she said she wanted to break up because she was moving far away and couldn’t commit to a long-distance relationship. She told me she wanted to explore her options in the new city. But it turns out I was wrong about her reasons, because she started dating the first guy who approached her in a coffee shop. And she had been approached before. What devastated me the most was finding out that just one month after our breakup, she started a relationship that is actually an even longer long-distance situation than what she would have had with me. Also her new boyfriend looks awful a lot worse than me. There are definitely better looking dudes out there that will provide you the same treatment. I was as well, but bringing up the past isn't how it works, and if you communicated to me about what we needed to work on, I would have, but you didn't.

Since our breakup, she has broken no contact a few times, reaching out every now and then, even though she was the one who ended things.

So ladies, have you ever chased or approached your ex or boyfriend? And guys, have you ever been the one who was chased by a woman? Obviosly many girls have but any dudes out here that have been thru this sitution?",2,1747933802.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

1ksw3w9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ksw3w9,Baby boxes,"Let’s talk about free baby boxes!!!! I have ordered and received baby boxes from Amazon, Target, Babylist, and Walmart. I’m attaching photos and a list from each so everyone can get an idea of what is included, so you can decide if you’d like to also get one 🙂 From my understanding, they should be about the same every month, with very slight variations. is there any other places you would recommend? (Sorry if someone already posted something like this!) Please note, I am located in the United States!


AMAZON - (first two photos)
To redeem: must have Amazon Prime, add 10 unique items to your baby registry, make a purchase of $10 from your registry (you or someone else can), then you can claim the box! It is free shipping.  I ordered the box on 4/18, and received it 4/26. 
I personally did this one right away once I found out I was pregnant. I just ordered some baby-safe laundry detergent and dryer sheets from my registry to get it activated.

It Included:
-one Swaddle Designs organic bodysuit, size 3 months (mine was mint green)
-one Amazing Baby newborn muslin swaddle (also a mint green color)
-pack of 1 Pampers pure diaper, size 1
-one Bright Starts perfect pair teether toy, 3 months+ (coffee and donut)-one Dr. Brown’s anti-colic bottle, 0+ months 
-one Philips bottle
-two Aquaphor sample size (.14 oz) baby healing ointment 
-one Palmer’s 2 step sample size skin therapy oil (.68 fl oz) and stretch marks lotion (.68 fl oz)
-a pamphlet about Amazon’s baby registry with some guides and checklists inside 

Coupons included:
-up to 10 free meals + first box ships free from Hello Fresh 
-up to $130 off from Factor
-20% off Dr. Nozebest bot 

*overall, I would say It is worth it if you have Prime! It is a smaller box, but you only have to spend $10 off your registry to get the free box with free shipping.



TARGET - (third photo)
To redeem: must be a Target Circle member (free), create a baby registry, add at least 10 items to your registry, purchase over $10 from your registry (you or someone else), allow 48 hours for the coupon to be issued to your account. Depending on where you live, you can redeem the coupon in store at the guest services counter for free, or order online and pay for shipping. From reading reddit, it sounds like most locations do not have it in stock at the store, so online may be easiest. Shipping was $5.99. I ordered the box on 4/29, and received it 5/2.
I added Palmers Mother/baby kit and prenatal to my registry and ordered those to reach the minimum, and minimum required for free shipping. 

It included:
-all items in a cute reusable target bag
-pack of 2 Millie Moon diapers, size 1
-pack of 1 Pampers pure diaper, size 1
-pack of 2 Up&Up diapers, size 1
-pack of 10 Honest wipes
-pack of 20 Up&Up wipes
-sample pack of Lansinoh nursing pad and breastmilk storage bag
-one Dr. Brown’s anti-colic bottle, 0+ months
-one Philips bottle
-one Bibs pacifier
-one Dapple Baby sample size (.45 oz) bottle and dish soap
-one Aveeno sample size (.5 oz) newborn balm
-one Mommy’s Bliss sample size (.17 oz) gripe water
-one Up&Up sample size (.34 oz) dreamy lavender baby lotion
-one Up&Up sample size (.34 oz) dreamy lavender shampoo & baby wash
-two Kendamil sample size (.76 oz) instant formula
*Unfortunately, the Kendamil formula samples expire on 10/29/25, which my due date is 10/28, so these are basically useless for me. I have tried to call Target multiple times and they cannot provide a solution besides going in-store. But as I mentioned before, the store locations near me do not carry baby boxes, so they are unable to exchange the formula samples. I will donate what I received of course. 

Coupons included:
-Save $1 on any full size Dapple product

*overall, this one had a nice variety of items. I was not as excited as I was with the Amazon box. you have to spend $10 minimum (off registry, and then free if you can find a store location with some boxes in stock). Or you can be like me and order everything online, and try to get free shipping (min $35 purchase for free shipping). So you have to spend minimum $41 ($35 min for free shipping and other items to activate the coupon, and then $5.99 to ship the actual box). If you plan to buy a few items from target anyways, this is worth the extra $6 to get.



BABYLIST - (fourth and fifth photos) 
To redeem: must create a Babylist registry, add 3 items from other stores, complete 40% of your registry checklist, make a minimum purchase of $30 from the Babylist shop (you or someone else can), and then order the box! Shipping was $8.95. I ordered the box on 4/29, and received it 5/7.
I ordered a few bath essentials and some clearance clothes. The items must be sold through Babylist specifically, which is a little limited, and the prices are higher than other stores. I ordered enough to get free shipping ($45 minimum purchase). I got a clearance outfit, clearance set of onesies, bath thermometer, and Frida control the flow rinser.

It included:
-one Kyte brand bamboo onesie, size 0-3 months (mind had a hedgehog print) 
-one Primary brand onesie, size 3-6 months (mind had a rainbow and sun print)
-one Stonyfield organic Yobaby bib (white and orange)
-one Beaufort Bonnet Company burp cloth (white with polka dots)
-pack of 3 Huggies skin essentials diapers, size 1
-pack of 2 Healthybaby diapers, size 1
-pack of 10 Waterwipes
-pack of 10 Honest wipes
-pack of 25 Ubbi baby wipes
-sample pack of Lansinoh nursing pad and breastmilk storage bag
-one Mom Cozy breast milk storage bag
-one Dr. Brown’s anti-colic bottle, 0+ months
-one Philips bottle
-one Suavinex silicone pacifier, size 0-6 months
-one Bibs pacifier
-one Lansinoh sample size (.05 oz) nipple balm

-save $2.00 off any one Triple Paste diaper rash cream

*I did get the free Little Unicorn swaddle and bodysuit from Colored Organics just to see, which are both nice quality. For the price of shipping, I think it was good. I also got the Bobbie formula as a backup, since I plan to breastfeed. Overall, I found that these three were decent coupons. I would not have purchased these items otherwise.
*I personally am not huge on using the coupons, so I threw most out or gave away. Unfortunately, I got rid of them before deciding to post this, so there are a few that I cannot remember that were included, and can’t fully tell based on the pictures, sorry!)
*overall, this box had a great variety of stuff and I think the most. You have to spend the most money to receive it, and it you have to buy items that are more expensive than from other locations in order to reach the $35 minimum. If you shop in the clearance, and spend just a few more dollars on some necessities, it may be worth it! I personally found it was worth it, and I was the very excited opening this box.



WALMART - (last two photos)
To redeem: create a Walmart baby registry, ensure it has been active for at least seven days, add a minimum of 20 items to the registry, purchase at least $25 from the registry (by you or others), then order the box! It is free shipping. I ordered the box on 5/8, and received it 5/21. 
I put a bunch of random things on my registry to help reach the minimum, as well as minimum required for free shipping ($35), and it worked! I got a heating pad, laundry dryer sheets, a clearance baby snow suit, and the Fridababy skinsoother. 

It included:
-Walmart pamphlet that has a list of must-haves and help with a baby checklist
-a pocketbook to keep track of the feeding schedule, and includes feeding information
-three pack of Carter’s white bodysuits, size newborn
-one Gerber baby pouch, good for in the hospital bag or diaper bag! (Mine was pink/orange/white/brown striped)
-two pack of Gerber modern moments wet/dry bags
-pack of 3 Huggies skin essentials diapers, size 1
-pack of 6 Pampers wipes
-pack of 24 Huggies wipes
-pack of 10 Honest wipes
-pack of 10 Water wipes
-one Dr. Brown’s anti-colic bottle, 0+ months
-one Tommee Tippee bottle, 0+ months
-one Aquaphor sample size (.14 oz) baby healing ointment
-one Enfamil sample size(2 fl oz) instant formula
-one Kendamil sample size (.76 oz) instant formula
*Unfortunately, I had the same issue with the formulas. the Kendamil formula sample expires on 10/29/25, and the Enfamil formula sample expires 10/30. I tried to call Walmart, and the gentleman could not locate the order to issue an exchange since it technically was a free box. I have not tried to go in-store yet, but I will update the in the comments once I try. I will donate what I received of course, if I cannot exchange. 

*overall, I loved this box. It had a great variety of items, and a few newer items I hadn’t seen in other boxes. Walmart has great prices, so I think it’s easy to get a lot of items to reach the minimum. I found it worth it!! Especially if you were going to buy anything from Walmart!



OVERALL, I LOVE getting the boxes! I did not try out many coupons (yet), but the small samples of products are great for diaper bags, and I have a nice start on bottles already! Do you have any more recommendations?",1,1747933748.0,BabyBumps,0,1.0,False

I’ll be visiting Nepal this July, coming from Istanbul, Turkey. I’d like to connect with some local people—not just for tourist advice, but to actually get to know the place through those who live there.

[Delonghi ECP3420, Baratza Encore]","Trying to change grind size. Aiming for taste first then shot time. But, even though all variables are constant from my end, the shot times and taste are different each time.

Equipment is cheap so I am not giving the exact models

1. Palm tamper plus leveler combined
2. Handheld WDT tool with close parallel needles
3. Store bought Lavazza (medium roast) whole bean coffee
4. Delonghi ECP 3420
5. 51mm bottomless portafilter
6. puck screen
7. Baratza Encore

I always run an empty portafilter first on the machine.

16g in 28g out on grind setting 3 takes over a minute to pull but gives the best taste. I don't time the stop and just stop when it looks runny.

51mm portafilter not able to fit 18g and puck screen properly, hence 16g.

Any grind size above 3 (Ex: 4/5/6) and the shot tastes sour 4/5 times on exact settings.  For grind size 6, it comes to the recommended range 30s on average but min is 22 and max is 36. And no matter the grind size / shot time, shot always becomes runny at 25g, extra 3g after stopping.

1ksw111,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1ksw111/my_managers_didnt_answer_their_phones_when_i_was/,My managers didn’t answer their phones when I was trying to find coverage and now I’m being written up.,"Hello Reddit!! I’m just coming down from a meltdown so if something is confusing or unclear, I’d be happy to answer questions in the comments. Im a little scattered brained too but I’m going to try to be concise. 

Also quick content warning for Vomiting for any queasy folks out there! 

So I, 19F have been working at an international coffee chain for a little over a year. I have to admit, I’ve had issues with calling out too frequently or on days that inconvenience our staff and manager. Im aware it doesn’t make a difference, my absence is still an issue, but I’ve been struggling with CVS (cyclical vomiting syndrome)  

Basically in the mornings and when I’m super stressed out (sometimes more than just that- it comes and goes in waves) I get super nauseous and will frequently have to rush to the restroom or nearest trash can to throw up. Sometimes I feel fine afterwards and will go to work anyways or I will push myself to go to work because I’ve already called out too many times, they need me on the schedule, or it’s a holiday/product launch. 

I frequently go to work sick and nauseous, half the time when I do call out my manager will push me to go in anyway. Especially if I didn’t start getting sick 3 hours before the shift, that’s our calling in stipulation. More times than not i will still go in because I feel guilty, even if that means having to throw up in the work bathroom multiple times a shift. It’s something I just have to put up with, and it sucks. Sometimes I can’t just put up with it and I have to convince my manager it’s not one of the power through days. 

I’ve had a many of discussion with my Management about this and I’ve had to procure 3 doctors notes within the past year so I don’t get fired. I’ve already been written up once for calling out. 
To get an idea of the frequency, within a month I will have probably called in 3 times, 2 of which I will just go in later than my original shift time. I also usually work 36-40 hours weekly. 

I feel I should also mention, I’ve never once called in when I wasn’t sick. I’ve never taken a mental health day (even though there are days I wish I fuckin could man) and I’ve never just tried to get out of work to have the day off. 

Now that’s all cleared up, onto this morning. 

I was scheduled from 8am-4pm. I woke up at like 7:15 and immediately had to vom, my head is also pounding because of an ear infection I have. Off the bat, not off to a great start but I have to be at work in 45 minutes. After the third time with my throbbing head hung over my toilet, i decided to check the schedule to see if I could find somebody to cover for me. We have to find coverage if it’s not 3 hours before a shift. 
(I also always offer to buy who ever covers for me a meal, coffee, snack for the covered shift and take one of theirs if it aligns with my next day off) 
So literally everybody at work is either out of town or only has the one day off. 

My manager was off today and she had been yesterday as well so I called her. My phone service was having problems so I wifi called her twice, used my mom’s phone twice, used the family business phone, and still no answer. I also tried our assistant manager. 

I called the store to let them know I was trying desperately to get a hold of our manager, not only to cover but I would need to tell her as well that I wouldn’t be going in. 
I’m now sobbing and panicking because I know I can’t take showing up to work, my head is spinning, I’m sobbing, vomiting, and hyperventilating in rapid intervals. My coworker who answered is a saint, she assured me that they weren’t going to struggle without me and offered to try to get in touch with management. No luck there. 

My uncle works on the grocery store side of things, he tried to get in touch with the store managers to let him know we couldn’t contact coffee place management. They also arent in today. 

I started freaking out more because it’s 10 past when I needed to be there. I was panicking and sobbing so hard that my uncle went ahead and told coffee house that I wouldn’t be going in today despite not contacting management or finding a replacement. 

The store called back like an hour ago (not my direct managers, just the store)  and said dont even worry about having a doctors note because they are going to consider this a no call no show and I’ll have to sign a write up and have a disciplinary meeting. 

I’ve already accepted that over the past hour, but I’m just sick, tired, and frustrated. With myself and my management. 

I know this is the result of my choice not to just go in today after not getting a hold of anybody, but I am in no condition to be on my feet for 8 hours and dealing with just everything else. It’s been hell here for a moment. we’ve got people quitting; one of which who does like 50% of my managers job even though he’s not the assistant manager. My manager also has been fucking me over by not supplying our food items and putting them in defrost when opening shift is supposed to leaving it for me in the evening doubling my work load, scheduling me one day off for two weeks by making me work bullshit hours, guilt tripping me any time I’ve asked for days off or to come in even after I’ve told her I’ve been consecutively sick, scheduling me by myself to close on weekends when it’s busy, releasing the new schedule on the last day of the old leaving the upcoming work schedule a mystery untill the day before. 

This feels like my last straw, but I know this is just a consequence of calling out too late. I feel like a winey little bitch. 

I’m frustrated, with myself and with my management. I don’t know if I should contest the write up, just take it and move on, or just put in my two weeks and find something different. Any and all advice is appreciated!! Please reality check me, if that’s what I need. 
Let me know what yall would do if you were in my position, I don’t know how I should deal with this. I want to be as professional and respectful as possible.

1ksvus4,https://i.redd.it/hbywnazh5d2f1.png,"""Tuck your shirt in.""","Yet another post about the great Dulau / Skarsgård combo and the amazing writing on this show.  
  
The show had built the Luthen/Kleya partnership on such a calculated, committed and professional level in Season 1 — while also conveying a deep, unbreakable bond.   
  
But in S2 Ep5, Kleya is on the radio having coffee and toast (when she learns about the Sculdun forgery problem) when Luthen also shows up with a coffee cup. ""You're up early..."" she says.  
  
I believe that's the first domestic moment between them we see. And I believe this is when we first learn they are probably living somewhere in the gallery building. As the audience, we get our first glimpse into the potential depth of their relationship.  
  
In Ep 10, the opening shot is Lonnie's alarm signal ringing in the middle of the night and Kleya showing up surprised and barefoot — in her demure and comfy space pajamas. Of course, she appears in the same door Luthen appeared during the above scene. Another small peak.  
  
That's why, when they are gearing up for what would be Luthen's final day, I was so struck by Kleya's delivery of ""Tuck your shirt in . . . ""  
  
This followed Luthen's foreboding and prescient line ""I think we used up all the perfect"" — which stops Kleya in her tracks. What we see is a real fear for Luthen's safety conveyed by Kleya.   
  
But the way she says ""Tuck your shirt in . . . "" breaks that tension with a moment of such familiarity and love. It's like the moment in some short stories where an affair is revealed by the small intimacy shared between two people who shouldn't be that close. So as an audience member, for the first time, I was actually pondering ""Wait a minute . . . what IS their relationship?""   
  
The age gap, their mission and principles, the plot incongruity — all of these were short circuiting the idea of a romantic relationship, yet that possibility was suddenly impossible to ignore.  
  
I had resigned myself to not getting a lot of their backstory, which was fine — especially given the actors' incredible nuanced performances. And I had no idea we were in for a powerful set of flashbacks. So when they filled all that in, and cleared that up, it was such a payoff, like a curtain falling to reveal an incredible tableau.  
  
And of course there's another entry in the endless list of layers in that same scene. As they realize their own end game approaches, Luthen says ""Move....""   
  
Later of course we learn this is part of his dictum in one of the flashbacks coming up (""When I say 'Move', you move...).  Only on re-watch do we realize why that word elicits the slightest smile from Kleya.   
  
Then it's 'Tuck your shirt in' . . . and we're off.   
Just fantastic.",52,1747933161.0,andor,1,0.99,False

After months of showing up early, covering shifts no one wanted, learning every product line like I was training for a beauty competition, I finally asked for it—a raise. Not a promotion. Not a management role. Just fifty-three cents more per hour. A small bump that would barely buy a coffee but would’ve meant someone noticed.

My manager nodded like she understood. “We’ll talk about it,” she said. That was two months ago.

Weeks passed, and I kept showing up. I kept waiting. Then one day I asked again.

She looked at me like I was speaking a different language. “I don’t remember that conversation,” she said, eyes blank.

I stood there, holding a box of hair dye, wondering how people can forget the moments that mean everything to someone else.

That night, I clocked out and didn’t come back.

Because if they couldn’t remember fifty-three cents, I wouldn’t let them forget what they lost when I walked out.

Love your channel. I’ve been holding onto this story for a while and I’d love to know what you (and everyone here) think.

I have not one, not two, but *three* wedding stories. So buckle up. These stories revolve around how three close friends got married in 2024, and everything that followed. The friends are Dolores, Ellie, and Brianna (me). We’re all women and were 26 when these events happened.

**Wedding 1: Dolores’s Wedding**

*We were inseparable for years, but when I needed her most, she vanished. Then she came back—with a wedding invitation, a messy engagement, and a request I wasn’t ready to say yes to.*

We met in high school back in 2012 and had been close friends ever since. From day one, the three of us were inseparable. Dolores and I were especially close—she even moved into the building next to mine after high school, and we attended the same university. We practically lived in each other’s pockets for years. Our moms became close too, especially since Dolores’s dad worked abroad and her extended family lived in another city.

Dolores had been dating Sebastian (30M), whom she met in university, for about 2–3 years. After graduation, they decided to get married. By that point, all three of us were working as doctors in different cities. It was our first time living far from home and each other.

I was feeling extremely lonely and burnt out. My then-boyfriend Brandon (27M) lived in another city too. I was depressed—and what hurt me most was that Dolores, my closest friend, never checked in. She took days to respond to my messages and stopped sharing her life with us. I told myself she was just busy.

Then came her engagement announcement. I had just had a minor nose surgery, but less than a week later, I got dressed, packed up, and traveled with Ellie to Dolores’s hometown for her engagement. It was a small family gathering. I helped out with everything I could.

That night, Dolores invited us to stay over. We were tired and thought it might be a nice chance to reconnect. We talked about how we’d drifted and promised to stay in touch. This was early 2023.

Some time later, Ellie got engaged. Dolores had moved back to our hometown, while I was still in a different city. Ellie’s engagement went smoothly. But at the event, I noticed Dolores looked visibly upset.

I pulled her aside and she opened up. She and Sebastian had decided not to have a wedding and to use the money to buy a house instead. Her family supported that but still wanted to host a traditional henna night (a women-only Turkish pre-wedding celebration).

Sebastian’s family objected, saying there couldn’t be a henna night without a wedding. Things escalated. Her family insisted on having it. His family refused. Sebastian sided with his parents and even blamed Dolores’s family.

I asked her, “Do *you* want the henna night?” She said yes. I told her she and Sebastian needed to come to a decision together and present a united front.

In the following weeks, she started opening up about Sebastian’s toxic behavior—how unsupported she felt, how confused she was about marrying him.

A week before their scheduled civil ceremony, I went to her city to support her. Her family was against the marriage. Dolores kept saying, “Everything was fine until our families got involved.” But I said, “Sebastian not being supportive isn’t your family’s fault.”

I was honestly getting frustrated. My best friend was in pain and still considering marrying someone who clearly didn’t respect her.

Ellie and I stayed with her for a few days. After long talks, she finally decided to call it off. She said, “I might feel weak—don’t let me text him.” We agreed.

During that time, I realized something that hurt more than I expected: she hadn’t been busy all those months. She had just chosen not to respond. That stung. But I didn’t bring it up—she was already heartbroken.

On what would’ve been their wedding day, Sebastian showed up at her house. He wanted to talk to her and her mom. Her mom didn’t want to host him inside, so we all got into our cars to meet at a nearby park.

When Sebastian saw Ellie and me, he shouted, “You’re not coming.” I calmly said, “We won’t be part of the conversation, but we’re not leaving her alone.”

He took off his ring, threw it into Ellie’s lap, and yelled, “Give this to her!” Then he left.

We went to the park, but he never showed. Instead, he called her mom and *verbally attacked* her on the phone. We spent the rest of the day trying to distract Dolores and lift her spirits. I even found a kitten from one of my friends the same day, since she was longing for a pet forever.

A few months later, she still barely talked to me. I sent her multiple messages explaining how hurt I was. She always apologized, said she understood, but *nothing changed*.

Then she got back together with Sebastian. They decided to get married in 2024. She asked us to be witnesses.

I told her I would only agree if Sebastian apologized for how he treated us. I suggested a coffee meetup so we could talk. She never followed through. Sebastian even visited the hospital where I work—and *ignored me* completely.

So I declined.

At the wedding, Dolores sat Ellie and me at a completely separate table, far from the rest of her university and high school friends. No explanation. Our mutual friend Nadine (26F) didn’t even say hello. Dolores’s mom barely acknowledged my mom.

Despite my own wedding coming up soon after, neither Dolores nor her mom offered any help or support. I had even asked Dolores to be one of my bridesmaids. I sent her the dress color. She never responded.

That was when I accepted our friendship was over. But the thing is—I still miss her. If she ever reaches out and wants to tell her side of the story, I’d be open. I really want to keep our friendship, even if it’s not the same as what we once had.

**Would love your take—do you think I overreacted, or did I finally set a boundary that needed to be set?**

I am a 36 year old male, HIV+, with only minor medical conditions (eczema, carpal tunnel).  I have never had anything Cardiac of note.

  
Yesterday (Wednesday) morning I woke up and as soon as I got out of bed, I felt some of the most extreme dizziness and nausea I've experienced and felt kind of forward a bit.  I went to try to start my morning routine, made some coffee, and within about 20 minutes, vomited up the coffee.  I switched to sipping water from that point on.

All through the day whenever I would stand or turn my head, I could feel immediate vertigo.  My stomach turns upon the feeling of vertigo, but does not feel bad at all outside of those moments.  I am able to stomach some bland pasta.

I went to Urgent Care last night.  The doctor there had the nurse come in and do BP testing where I would sit and then stand and they were measuring both.  My BP went down during those instances (from 120/77 to 99/89 if I read her post-it note correctly).  I don't know what is significant or what is not, but she did tell me that.  He then prescribed some Zofran for the nausea and let me go.

What scares me is constantly feeling like I'm going to faint feels serious.  We weren't able to really determine why I am all of the sudden feeling extreme vertigo and nausea when I never have before in my life.

I woke up today and was more cautious not to drink coffee first thing.  I did not vomit today, however I am continuing to feel the same nausea and dizziness.  I took 4mg of Zofran 2 hours ago and the nausea continues.

  
I have no idea what this could be, but even sitting here typing I feel every few moments like I might faint.  Sometimes I get that electric-shocky feeling down my back.

  
Does anyone have any clue?  I tried sending my Primary Doc a note on MyChart this morning and have not heard back.

  
Medications are:

Dovato - Daily for HIV

Triamcinolone - an as-needed steroid for eczema (I had gone from 24 hours between applications to 36 hours as part of titrating downward)

3) when I’m done, go down and find my partner used the water I boiled. He said I left it for 15 minutes and he was waiting all that time to make tea. He said it shouldn’t matter that I wait another 2-3 min for it to boil. He’s sick and he needed tea so why am I upset?

1ksvm4f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ksvm4f,Is this a normal foam:coffee ratio?,"This is a Vertuo round head that someone in my apartment complex left behind. I've cleaned it, descaled it, and factory reset it, and it seems to be running pretty smoothly. 

However, I don't have any experience with vertuo machines (my office has an original Pixie, which only make small cups), so I'm not sure how long it should take to brew or how much foam to expect. The couple times I've tried brewing, it's almost overflowed my mug, so I decided to measure and see if it was actually stopping at the 230mL listed for the pod size. The final volume (not pictured) was about 200mL of coffee with 100mL of foam on top.

1ksvlwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ksvlwj/cant_get_hot_enough_lelit_marax_v2/,Can’t get hot enough [Lelit MaraX v2],"I'm relatively new to brewing with the MaraX v2, and I'm struggling to bring it to temperature.

I'm currently on XMode Steam (position 1 / I) and on temp setting 2 (switch on the right side). From my understanding that should give me about 94C in terms of water temp.

I switch on the machine and wait for 20- 25 minutes. The temperature LED has been solid for a few minutes, about 10 or so. I have an E61 temperature sensor installed in the group head. From what I've read, it should read about +2C, so if the temperature sensor shows 96C, the water hitting the puck should be around 94C. I get it's not exact to a tenth of a degree, but roughly.

My issue is I have to cycle the lever multiple times to keep kicking the boiler on to reach 94- 95C on the temp sensor, which would suggest the actual water temp is only 92-93C. If I pull a shot right after the machine has warmed up - after those initial 20- 25 minutes - the temp on the sensor is just about 91- 92 °C and the boiler pressure sits at about 1.5 bar. When I cycle the lever or pull the first shot, the boiler kicks in and stops at around 2.2- 2.5 bar, and the temp rises by probably a degree.

Is this normal? Shouldn't the machine heat up to a point where it reaches the desired temperature? I know pulling consecutive back-to-back shots will cause the machine to keep getting warmer and warmer but I'm not sure whether cycling the lever to kick the boiler on is normal to reach the desired temp.

I’ve also tried XMode Coffee but the results are pretty much the same",1,1747932562.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

Roadmap  
\_\_\_  
**Terlingua – January 15**

The sun was just waking up.  
You thought I was sleeping.  
Wrapped tight in your blanket  
you clung to your coffee like hope.  
I watched you play with birds.

You crept behind cover like you wouldn’t be seen.  
They kept you a bush away,  
still close enough to keep you chasing.  
So you did.

In that moment I saw you for you,  
before I knew your depths.  
That morning I knew I would love you.  
⸻  
**Salt Flat – February 23**

We drove all day,  
but it felt like an instant.  
We talked about everything—nothing.  
Subtle glances,  
grazing touches.  
Our comfort told us we were onto something.  
Neither of us had to say it.

When we got to our camp the sky was on fire.  
We knew it was performing.  
Mirroring what it saw in us  
like we put it there ourselves.  
We hadn’t said it yet,  
but our eyes knew the words.  
⸻  
**Santa Rosa Beach – May 4**

Handshakes and smiles.  
Talking about my job.  
Four generations together.  
My first time meeting most of them.  
My time to shine.

But really,  
seeing your role, your peace, your glow.  
Daughter, sister, mother, rock.  
Watching your smile fill the room.  
Your warmth filled my heart.

The three of us shared a room that night.  
We made love while >!NAME🤖!< slept.  
Quiet, but on fire.  
I held you so tight.  
You always fit like you were made for me.  
You surrendered.

It made us stronger.

⸻  
**Gila Hot Springs – May 26**

Who gets this far away just to run and look at stars with someone they love?

What do we see here that we don’t see at home?

I see you.  
At peace. Decompressed.  
Curious. Soft.  
Your touches, your words,  
I’m in awe of your poise.  
Are we finding our stride?  
Is this comfort safe?

We share the same love,  
for each other, in life.  
We don’t take it for granted.  
Like air or a date circled on the calendar,  
we don’t have to talk about it,  
but we know it’s there.

In this moment our time is eternal.  
⸻

**Cuchara – July 4**

Our first two bedroom cabin.  
Our first family trip.

Taking turns.  
Building trust.

Walkie talkies, shoulder rides, and bears.  
Stomach born laughter.

She was perfect.  
And you were happy.

Our corner of heaven,  
It was all we needed.  
⸻

**Crestone – October 12**

Just meet me in the middle.  
I’m waiting.  
Vulnerable. Exposed.

I’ve built my house on your cliffs,  
but I don’t fear the waves.  
I’ve heard the softness of your voice.

I’d let you tear me apart,  
but I know you won’t,  
I’ve felt the softness of your touch.

Let me tear you apart,  
you know I won’t.  
Trust the strength of my love.  
⸻

**Jemez Springs – February 14**

We ran through the mountains together.  
Not for the first time,  
but I didn’t know it would be our last.

7,000’.  
It was snowing, we didn’t hesitate.  
We never did when it came to running.

Later I asked for your hand,  
and told you I’d give you my life  
if you just said yes.

(I thought) the answer came easy.  
Things always did if we didn’t fight it.  
“It shouldn’t be this hard.”

Now I look back at this trip,  
and I can’t remember the details.  
Am I protecting myself or are you already a fading memory?  
⸻  
**Home Depot Parking Lot – May 20**

I was five minutes early.  
You were ten minutes late.

You used to tell me I overthink things,  
but I know it means something this time.

We both had our notes ready.  
The first ones we’ve written that weren’t about our love.

Yours was polished and folded neatly.  
You always focused on the small details.

I know mine was messy.  
Why does my writing always get worse at the bottom of the page?

Before I left I read the one where you said I was the love of your life.  
Are we both still breathing?

It’s hard being the one that’s left behind.  
Am I supposed to feel like a child?

I almost ran back to my car after you gave me the ring.  
Didn’t it fit right? Didn’t you like the way it shined?

You were supposed to wear it forever.  
Now it’s just a memory.",2,1747932175.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

Tom’s perched on the edge of a chair, Nuggets cap askew, nodding like a bobblehead desperate for a pat on the head. They’re battling over the 2025 offseason like it’s a Waystar coup.\*

**LOGAN**: (growling, swirling his scotch) Alright, you pack of spoiled piranhas, we snatched the Nuggets from the Kroenkes—slid a few million through their TV deal’s backdoor while they were counting their ranch cash. We’re here to build an empire, not wipe a loser’s ass. The refs fucked us in Games 2 and 7—OKC didn’t win, they stole it. Jokić’s a goldmine, but this roster’s a landfill. Fix it—champs by ‘27. Kendall, no manifestos. Tom, no cornfield karaoke. Go.

**KENDALL**: (halting mid-pace, intense) Dad, Jokić’s a three-time MVP, a goddamn Picasso with a basketball. Trade Porter’s $38 million anchor for Dorian Finney-Smith—grit, defense, no drama. Keep Murray, extend Gordon, sign Bruce Brown for pennies. Ditch Adelman for Nick Nurse. This isn’t a rebuild; it’s a fucking renaissance.

**SHIV**: (smirking, snapping her cap sheet shut) Renaissance? Kendall, that’s your Adderall talking. You’re swinging like a frat boy at a kegger. We’re $200 million deep, cap tighter than Roman’s Tinder profile. Keep Jokić, Murray, Gordon. Swap Nnaji for Daniel Theis. Hire a GM who doesn’t need a calculator for breakfast. Precision, not your Coachella pipe dream.

**KENDALL**: (snarling) Precision? Shiv, your plan’s so gutless it could star in a rom-com. Nurse brings fire; Adelman’s a glorified babysitter. We need a revolution, not your bean-counter bullshit.

**SHIV**: (icy, leaning in) Revolution? Ken, you’re chasing TED Talk applause while we’re bleeding cash. My moves keep us contenders, not bankrupt.

**TOM**: (leaning forward, cap wobbling) Uh, Logan, Shiv’s playing checkers, but we need chess. Jokić’s our Rolex, but Porter for Zach LaVine? That’s star power, ticket sales. I hooped at St. Olaf’s—flash wins hearts. Keep Adelman; he’s got the locker room’s vibe. It’s a rebrand, baby—core plus sizzle.

**KENDALL**: (scoffing) LaVine, Tom? That’s a walking ER visit with a worse deal than Porter’s. Stick to polishing Logan’s shoes.

**GREG**: (wincing as a pen smacks his ear, stammering) Uh, Tom’s… got a spark? r/nba’s torching Porter’s $79 million deal—like, yikes, it’s a cursed NFT. Trade for Hachimura and a pick? r/denvernuggets says Adelman’s chill, but the West’s a slaughterhouse—Thunder, Wolves. We need a bench, right? Or am I, like, dribbling into a void?

**SHIV**: (rolling her eyes) Dribbling into a void’s your brand, Greg. Hachimura’s a bench warmer, not a savior. Keep scrolling, Reddit boy.

**LOGAN**: (glaring at Roman, who’ now doodling a stick-figure of Jokić next to a stick-horse) Roman, you’re lounging like a trust-fund burnout. Stop pelting Greg and give me something, or I’ll trade you for a mascot.

**ROMAN**: (grinning, twirling a pen like a baton before yeeting it at Greg’s nose) Oh, Dad, I’m just dodging this nerd prom. Ken’s humping “culture” like it’s his therapist, Shiv’s got her nose in a spreadsheet, Tom’s pitching a Vegas floorshow, and Greg’s a Reddit Roomba. My take?  Luka’s my guy, alright? Hooked up with him at an LA hookah lounge pop-up—dude was puffing mango clouds and chugging Heinekens, vibing like a king. He digs my vibe. I’ll slide into a bathroom, catch him mid-piss, and go, “Luka, ditch the Lakers’ clown car—LeBron’s creaking like an old yacht, and Redick’s coaching like he’s still reading his own podcast script. Come sling passes with Jokić— that balkan brotherhood, fuckin’….all-star world domination, baby.”  Go big, or we’re the fucking Hornets.

1ksvdwp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ksvdwp,7 Days Engagement Trip in October: Surpassed Expectations,"Wrote this months ago, but just found this in my drafts. The level of details decreases after Day 3  due to writing it 7 months after the trip. Warning: It's pretty long.

Wanted to share my trip that made Iceland our most favorite place to visit as well as an unforgettable engagement trip. Hopefully this will help others on the fence about visiting, as its a must visit place. If anybody wants my Wanderlog itinerary, please let me know and I'll share it.

Quick Summary:

* Total Trip Cost: \~$7K total for 2 people incl. airfare. Only stayed at hotels, Tesla rental, and ate out mostly with a few Bonus/Kronan grab 'n go sandwiches.
* Itinerary
   * Day 1: Arrival/Snaefellsnes
   * Day 2: Golden Circle
   * Day 3: Kerid Crater/Secret Proposal
   * Day 4: South Coast pt.1
   * Day 5: Skaftafell/Glacier Lagoon
   * Day 6: South Coast pt.2
   * Day 7: Reykjavik

We wanted to see most of South Coast as much as possible in only 7 days, so I was worried we weren't going to fully experience many attractions, but ended up being fine! We did drive 2-4hrs on average every day, changing hotels, but EV chargers were widely available at or nearby our hotels, as well as superchargers conveniently located along the main roads. 

From online research, Iceland's weather is unpredictable but consensus seemed October is a rainy month. We had bought a bunch of rainwear, but we got super lucky as it only rained for a 2hrs on the first day and as we were leaving Iceland. A bucketlist of ours was to see Northern Lights, hoping for just once, but ended up seeing it every single night. Minus this being an engagement trip, it still was the most memorable place we've visited and would love to explore the northern Iceland as well as come again with our families. 

Detailed Version:

**Logistics**

Flights booked in February and hotels with refundable options in April. But ended up changing 5 of 6 hotels in August trying to maximize my miles with American Airlines. Original itinerary was maybe $5-600 cheaper since it was booked earlier and less availability of cheaper options in August.

Rented a Tesla Model 3 from Zero Car Rental, and was about $730 with a discount code found in this sub. Despite fewer reviews, felt safe considering it was a subsidiary of Blue Car Rentals. After reading about the insane fuel prices in Iceland (+$100 for a full tank), I took a gamble with an EV. Really paid off since most of the hotels had some type of slow charging at the property or at least nearby for a low price, allowing us to fully charge overnight. From driving 2-4hrs everyday, we did have to charge almost every night and twice during the day with superchargers but total cost was right under $50! Highly recommend PlugShare website to put in your destinations to calculate distance driven as well as to find charging stations along the way. Most needed an app to start charging. I used Isorka, E1, and ON apps.

Reminder to check if you need to pay for parking. I'd say 75% of the places we visited required paid parking. I assumed it's like in the US where they have people checking and calling towing if violated, and knowing how remote these places are, didn't think it'd be a big deal if we didn't plan on spending a lot of time. They literally have cameras taking pictures of your license plate as you enter, so make sure to pay if you don't want a big fine. I'd say it was 1000 ISK most of the time. For big tourist locations, Parka seemed to be most prominent. Other locations, either use the stations or QR code. I was surprised how these remote places had decent cell service.

**Day 1: Arrival/Snaefellsnes**

* Places visited: **Kirkjufell, Murals of Hellissandur, Skarðsvík Beach, Saxhóll Crater, Djúpalónssandur, Malarrif Lighthouse, Arnarstapi Cliff Viewpoint, Rauðfeldsgjá Gorge, Búðakirkja**
* Accommodation: Hótel Búðir (\~$340); 2 Free Slow EV Charging @ property
* Food: Sandwiches from Bonus for lunch. For dinner, FRISTA food truck in Arnarstapi (\~$50 for two)

Took a direct overnight flight via IcelandAir from US East Coast. Since our arrival was 6:30AM, we took melatonin to sleep on the plane and minimize jet lag. Took less than 30min from going through immigration and retrieving bags. Kinda got confused with car rental since Blue Car didn't have a booth at KEF and not much pick up info from Zero Car email. I ended up looking up Blue Car in google maps, and it was about 5-7 min walk from the departures area. Actual pick up was easy with a key locker. Tesla had a 97% charge.

Snaefellsnes is about a 3hr drive from KEF and no Kronan or Bonus in Snaefellsnes. We stopped by Bonus in Bogarnes to grab a few snacks and sandwiches. Super windy day with wind gusts up to 40mph. First stop was **Kirkjufellsfossar**. Despite being cloudy, it was really beautiful and saw some Icelandic horses up close (pic 1). We drove by **Murals of Hellissandur**, but I don't know if it's worth getting out of the car here. Quick 5-10 minute drive. **Skarðsvík Beach** was a quick stop to take some photos. **Saxhóll Crater** could be slightly disappointing, but we had fun because it was SO WINDY. Never experienced wind where I had a hard time going forward. It was thrilling at the top being pushed around, but kinda scary going up and down the stairs. Next was **Djúpalónssandur**, easy walk and the shipwreck at the beach was cool! We went to **Malarrif** afterwards, and important to note is that this was the only public bathroom available at its visitor center and it closes at 4! We could've walked to **Londrangar**, but we decided to drive instead.

We stopped by **Arnarstapi Cliff** and ate at FRISTA Food Truck. We got Fish & Chips as well as their Chicken Quesadilla for just under $50. Our last stop was **Rauðfeldsgjá Gorge**. Maybe a 20 minute hike, and beautiful inside as well. We stayed at Hotel Budir, which is right next to the **Búðakirkja**, about a 3 min walk. Scenery at this hotel was beautiful, and could see Bjarnarfoss from a distance. 2 free EV charging here, although it was occupied. If you see 2 Nissan Leafs here, most likely it is their staffs. They said to check around 10-11PM once they leave to charge overnight. And got to see our first (of many) northern lights here! When we hurriedly walked out after the knock, I was expecting to see the vibrant colors with my naked eyes. So I was confused when I didn't see anything in the sky, but it was beautiful in the pictures.

**Day 2: Golden Circle**

* Places visited: **Þingvellir, Geysir, Gullfoss**
* Activities: Silfra Snorkeling with [DIVE.is](http://DIVE.is) ($300 for two)
* Accommodation: Blue Hotel Fagrilundur (\~$250). Free breakfast. No EV charging at property, but many fast & slow options within walking distance
* Food: Sandwiches from Bonus for brunch. Reykholt Hub ($30) and cup Shin Ramen for dinner

About 2.5hr drive to **Þingvellir**. Arrived a little later than planned, but still walked around to see the **Almannagjá**, and **Þingvallakirkja** before our scheduled snorkeling at 12PM. There's 4 or 5 different parking for Þingvellir, and as long as you pay once, you can park in any of those. We booked **Silfra Fissure Snorkeling** with Dive.is. Beautiful sunny day with weather was around 35F or 1C, but the suits they provided along with the Uniqlo Heat Tech we wore underneath didn't freeze our bodies even in the water. The hands and head were wet suits, meaning it could get bring in water when submerged. While it was cold when the water came in, I wasn't too bothered by it, but my girlfriend's hands were freezing by the end. My gf is also not the best swimmer, but very easy to navigate and the view underneath made it extremely worthwhile. Would highly recommend if capable. For the entire experience, it was almost exactly 2.5hrs, with about 40-50 minutes in the water.

Afterwards, we went to **Öxarárfoss** for a short visit and then made our way to **Geysir Hot Springs.** The sulfur did in fact smell like rotten eggs but not unbearable. We got to see 3 different eruptions and got some nice photos. For our last stop, we went to **Gullfoss**. Absolutely stunning with the sheer magnitude of the waterfall. We walked the trail to the waterfall and it was amazing. If you don't care about the gift shop/restaurant/bathroom and want the quickest route to the waterfall without having to go up and down the stairs, would recommend the parking lot located in Gullfossvegur road instead of the normal Gullfoss parking further up Kjalvegur road.

We made our way to our hotel which was **Blue Hotel Fagrilundur**. We planned to eat the cup Shin Ramen that we packed, and wanted something to complement the dinner. The **Reykholt Hub Campsite** right across the street had a restaurant, and we got 2 chicken tenders, onion rings, and mozzarella sticks which came out to $30. Thought it was expensive, but big portions forcing us to have leftovers. We used their hot tubs and got to see our 2nd northern lights in the hot tub! No EV charging at the property, but there were 2 different fast charging locations, as well as a low cost slow charging option within walking distance. I elected to the slow charging option which was the furthest with a 7 minute walk. I woke up middle of the night to stop charging on the Isorka app to not incur idle charges.

**Day 3: Kerid Crater/Secret Proposal**

* Places visited: **Hrunalaug Hot Spring, Kerid Crater, Gluggafoss**
* Accommodation: Brú Guesthouse (\~$320), paid slow EV charging on property
* Food: Friðheimar lunch and Hygge Dinner

After eating free breakfast, we went the **Hrunalaug Hot Spring** right before its opening time of 9AM. Just under $20 per person, and we were the only ones there for a good 15-20 minute allowing us to take photos in the cold. They had a changing room and baskets for our belongings that we could bring around. 3 different pools, while the Sheep pool was the most scenic and warmest, we didn't want to be the ones hogging the place as its just enough for 2 people. Tourist pool which was recently build wasn't as warm. Ended up staying in the Laundry pool which had the walls to shield us from the wind. Definitely worth visiting early as it did get somewhat crowded when we left an hour later.

My girlfriend told me before that her ideal proposal was for a photographer and not in her unpretty(?) clothes (aka hiking gear). Before she got ready, I told her today is going to be a chill day with not much hiking and nice lunch, so dress nicely. I come out of the shower and she's in her in hiking pants, so I had to convince her to wear something else. She told me afterwards that this is where she assumed it was happening today.

After getting ready at the hotel, we went to **Friðheimar** for lunch. I made the reservation in May, and when we arrived the host was calling someone that the place so fully booked, so do book couple months in advance. There's also 4 fast EV chargers if you need to charge here. We both got the tomato soup which is unlimited self serve with different freshly baked breads. Also got chicken and seafood skewers for our proteins. Even as someone who doesn't like tomatoes (veggies in general), this place is still worth the visit for the greenhouse and vibe alone. We finished off with their tomato sorbet dessert which was also great. Around $100 for both of us including drinks. More expensive than other Iceland restaurants, but worth it for the atmosphere.

We stopped by **Kerid Crater**, 600 ISK for admission/person. We just walked the trail around the top. Afterwards, we stopped by Selfoss for some gift shopping and Bonus to grab more sandwiches. I made the excuse of having to check-in on time at the hotel to make sure we'd arrive at **Gluggafoss** for the arrangement with our photographer. Our photographer was **""Iceland Photographer | Leszek Nowakowski""** whom I got in contact with in June. He was wonderful in suggesting locations and communicating as well as during the photoshoot. He even brought his kids and dogs which really helped playing into the disguised random photographer. Gluggafoss is a place he suggested, which was perfect as it was not crowded at all, with only one elderly couple there. We both didn't want to be the center of attention. For our second shoot, he took us to a 'secret' black sand beach and literally no one was there. Cannot recommend him enough if you're also planning on proposing near the ring road. Sorry for anybody reading this, but will keep this location secret for him to bring people there for his photoshoots!

For dinner, we went to **Hygge Restaurant and Bar**. Inside of the restaurant is not where you'd expect fancier dishes, but the food was amazing. We got Patatas bravas and Mink Whale tataki for starters. My now-fiance got the braised beef in viking beer, while I had to try their horse fillet. She didn't want to try the horse, but man it was such a great dish. Tasted just like tender beef with no gamey taste at all. The best part was that it was very reasonable prices. We paid \~$110 for all the dishes above, and I would've expected it to be more considering the dishes.

We drive to the **Brú Guesthouse**, which had stretches of gravel roads for like 5-10min. The property itself is rather remote, but decently isolated from other cabins for privacy. Wanted somewhere nicer than a hotel, and this place was almost half the price of a similar property near Seljalandsfoss. Another night, another northern lights sighting. There's a slow EV charger towards the entrance, which is a slow 3min drive due to gravel, and a 5-7min walk back.

**Day 4: South Coast Pt. 1**

* Places visited: **Seljalandsfoss, Gljufrabui, Skogafoss, Kvernufoss, Dyrholaey Lighthouse, Reynisfjara Beach, Fjadrarglijufur**
* Accommodation: Fosshotel Glacier Lagoon (\~$800 for 2 Nights)
* Food: Black Crust Pizzeria

Originally wanted to see sunrise from **Seljalandsfoss**, but woke up late and arrived around 8AM. Still early enough where it wasn't too crowded and was able to get great photos from behind the waterfall. After checking out **Gljufrabui** around 9AM, there were numerous tourist buses with hordes of people. We made the drive over to **Skogafoss**, and did not realize how big it was from online research. We decided to hike the stairs for a view from above, maybe 10-15min to go up, and spent another 30 minutes towards the trail. Then we decided to also see **Kvernufoss**, which had paid parking. I'd say it's a much smaller Seljalandsfoss with the ability to go behind the waterfall here as well.

Next stop was **Dyrholaey Lighthouse**, fun drive going up the curvy hills, and the photos from here look like a drone shot. Then drove to **Reynisfjara** **Beach,** where I believe the light was green. It was super windy and felt some pebbles were flying into us. Was worried more about the car getting damaged. Took some photos on the rock pillars. For lunch, we wanted to try **Black Crust Pizzeria**. It was really busy, but they would only let customers sit after everyone ordered, so nobody could reserve seats. We both ordered a pizza each, wanting to eat leftovers for dinner. Thought it'd be a gimmick, but the pizza was indeed delicious with rather unusual toppings. Also stopped by Kronan as it'd be the last grocery option.

Our final stop was **Fjadrargljufur**. Maybe spent an hour visiting all the way to the end and back with beautiful views of the canyon. Drove to our hotel, **Fosshotel Glacier Lagoons**. Since it wasn't peak season, the prices were rather reasonable and wanted a nice base for the more attractions in the East. Also paid for the breakfast rate, considering there weren't too many options near the area. There were 2 hot tubs and a sauna to relax. We did feel like the we're youngest ones here haha. Asked for northern lights call, and call we received. 4/4 on northern lights. They did have multiple EV chargers, although I couldn't get it to work with the app.

**Day 5: Skaftafell/Glacier Lagoon**

* Places visited: **Skaftafell, Glacier Lagoon, Diamond Beach**
* Activities: Ice Cave & Glacier Hike with Arctic Adventures ($\~300 for 2)
* Accommodation: Fosshotel Glacier Lagoon (\~$800 for 2 Nights)
* Food: Fosshotel Glacier Lagoon Restaurant

Ice Cave and Glacier Hike was one of the top things I wanted to do in Iceland. I believe a couple months before our trip, there was a tragic accident involving death of tourists from an ice cave collapsing. While I considered cancelling, users here seemed to blame the company that was offering tours during the summer months when the ice would be melting. I double checked Arctic Adventures website, and we decided to keep it since they were only offering it Oct-Apr.

Nonetheless, I had originally planned this day to be the tour and Svartifoss nearby only, thinking we'd be way too tired from the strenuous hike. It actually wasn't too bad. We drove 30min from **Skaftafell** after getting our gears and a brief safety instruction. The ice cave itself was actually very small/short, maybe 2 minutes to go through it while taking photos. But the glacier hike was fun and quite challenging. We booked for the 10AM tour, and finished around 2PM. We didn't feel like hiking again for Svartifoss, so just ate some Kronan sandwiches at the picnic tables and decided to change our plans to visit Glacier Lagoon and Diamond Beach instead of the next day.

Unable to figure out EV chargers at the hotel, our Tesla was low on charge, and the Tesla's map would tell us we wouldn't have enough charge to make it to Glacier Lagoon and back. Thankfully there was an ON charging station not too far from Skaftafell where we charged a good amount within 20 minutes. We rested at the hotel and headed to **Glacier Lagoon** around 4PM. We didn't have any bookings, but was able to buy tickets for the Amphibian Boat Tour for about 7000 ISK. We had about 30-45minutes to hang before our time, so wandered around the Lagoon. The boat itself was packed but cool experience being able to hold a piece of the ice and seeing some seals. Shortly after, we visited the Diamond beach, although there weren't too many ice on the beach.

For dinner, we made a reservation in the morning at the reception. We used the hot tub and sauna once more before making it to our 8PM reservation. Probably the most expensive meal during our trip, somewhere around 25000 ISK for both of us, but this was supposed to be our ""engagement dinner"". Food and drinks were delicious, and they gave us a free dessert after finding out we had just gotten engaged. I was able to figure out the EV chargers by just tapping my card instead of using the app. I just decided to pay for the idle fees because I had no way to track via app, and didn't want to wake up in the middle of the night to unplug. While I was out, another northern lights. 

**Day 6: South Coast Pt. 2**

* Places visited: **Svartifoss, Gönguleið um Eldhraun, Yoda Cave, Lava Show in Vik**
* Accommodation: Aurora Lodge Hotel (\~$250)
* Food: Systrakaffi, The Soup Company

We had breakfast at the hotel, and the view was absolutely stunning. Our first stop was **Svartifoss**, which took about an hour to hike there and back. The partially frozen waterfall was a sight to see. We weren't too hungry for lunch, but had some sandwiches and decided to stop by **Systrakaffi** for some fries and coffee. Then made the short drive to the **Mossy Lava Fields (Gönguleið um Eldhraun)** to see the vast landscape we didn't really see previously on the drive up. 

Our final sight attraction was the **Yoda Cave.** After driving for like 10 minutes on the gravel roads, we reached the parking lot, which I remember using a different website/app than the other ones. Had some issues with payment but was able to resolve it. Honestly, not really worth it. Sure the cave looks like Yoda, but that's literally it. There were some random chairs on the beach, but not really worth paying for parking just to see the cave. 

We decided to stop by Kronan in Vik again for some snacks and also stopped by Icewear next door for souvenirs. **The Lava Show in Vik** was a fantastic experience. I didn't have much expectations going in, but the storytelling as well as seeing lava up close was fun. For dinner, we went with **The Soup Company** in the same building. I tried the option to try all 4 soups with refills. We were fine with not getting a refill. Stopped by a Tesla Supercharger in Hvolsvollur, which was only 10 minutes away from our hotel, **Aurora Lodge Hotel.** It had more of a cabin feel to the place. We booked a standard room + breakfast, but they upgraded us to the Superior room + breakfast. They had 2 hot tubs towards the front desk, so this was the furthest walk we had to make outside to reach the hot tub. Thankfully nobody was using it (probably because it was so cold and windy). 6/6 for Northern Lights. 

**Day 7: Reykjavik**

* Places visited: **Nauthólsvík Geothermal Beach, Harpa Concert Hall, Hallgrimskirkja, Rainbow Street,** **~~Sky Lagoon~~****, Blue Lagoon**
* Accommodation: Keflavik Micro Suites
* Food: Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur, Oriento

Ate breakfast and left for Reykjavik around 8AM. Drove for 2hrs and arrived at the **Nauthólsvík Geothermal Beach.** I thought it'd just be a pretty place, but did not expect to see people swimming in 35F (1C) weather. The geothermal bath looked nice, wish we had more time to experience it. We wanted to visit the Grotta Island Lighthouse, but it was during high tide when we went so we decided to skip it. We parked our car at Harpa Concert Hall with EV charging available and decided to walk around to shop. Had to stop by **Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur**, and we only waited like 2 minutes. I was a big fan of the hotdog, and ended up getting a second, as well as another at KEF on our flight back home. 

Stopped by **Hallgrimskirkja**, decided not to go up top of the tower, but was beautiful inside. Went to multiple shops on the **Rainbow Street**, but wasn't really interested in stores for tourists only. One store that caught my attention was 66 North. Really liked the style, but quite expensive. Learned that they had an outlet store not too far away, so we also decided to check that out. Didn't end up getting anything after finding out they also sell via US website. 

We had a reservation at **Sky Lagoon** 6PM with the dinner plate reserved. We pulled into the parking lot, and it was almost empty. I thought to myself, ""wow we continue to get lucky this trip, we'll have the Lagoon to ourselves"". But we go inside, and a sign says Sky Lagoon is closed due to a water maintenance issue. Really bummed out, but we decide to check Blue Lagoon if they have any open spots and thankfully there's one for 7PM. 

Due to the late time, **Blue Lagoon** wasn't packed but it was dark, so was bummed out we couldn't see any views surrounding it. Nonetheless, it was a pleasant experience wandering around the water with not too many people there and also started drizzling. Our rate included the mask packs and drinks included. We were able to experience all of the areas with very few people, although the sauna was packed. We'd love to visit again, maybe even stay at the hotel next time to see the views. While it was still cloudy, we were able to see northern lights hidden behind the clouds as we're walking out. 

Made our drive to our final hotel K**eflavik Micro Suites.** Chose this area as it was the closest to the airport and we had an early morning flight the next day. I was hungry so got some kebab at Oriento which was one of the few restaurants that was open around 10PM. We charged our EV overnight at a nearby hotel maybe 5 minute walk away.

During my childhood, I was quite an introvert so during family gatherings my cousins and relatives used to force me to dance with them. I hated it, so most of the time I end up crying. They were also super embarrassed of me because I sat somewhere in the corner instead of dancing with them. 

It actually followed me to adulthood. I never felt comfortable dancing when someone is present, not even my husband. Few years back, I went for a new years party with my husband’s friends and the girls were really forcing me to dance relentlessly. I started to feel really angry and horrible, I didn’t attend the next event. I guess they understood. 

Last year, they invited us for clubbing. Which I hate, my husband isn’t also into it but it was a treat from his friend so we had to go. They were all super drunk and dancing and enjoying themselves, while I just sat there having cocktails. They kept asking why I didn’t dance, why I am not dancing. 

I just can’t do it people. First of all, I don’t like to be in between too much people, I don’t like touching anyone or anyone touching me, I am super uncomfortable shaking my body in front of others. 

It’s just not me. I can’t enjoy it. 
I prefer sitting home with a cup of coffee watching some series with my soulmate. People find it boring, it’s okay with me as I am happy and don’t care what others think or not. 

When I was a child my relatives used to say, I would embarrass my future husband because I don’t dance, I would learn once I get married since he will force me to dance. 
I guess life has been nice to me because my husband isn’t into dancing too, he prefers to spend time with me just like I want to spend time with him ❤️",12,1747931974.0,Coconaad,8,0.94,False

The World Is Still There

Chapter 1 – Before the Noise

The coffee was already ready when the sun began to filter through the thick curtains of the camper. Its smell—strong and familiar—filled the cabin even before Michael opened his eyes. He didn’t use an alarm clock. For years now, his body had decided on its own when it was time to get up. That morning, like many others, it was still dark when he sat on the edge of the bed, in silence, listening to the nothing.

The parking lot was that of an old abandoned gas station just outside Santa Fe. A faded tin sign swayed in the weak wind, creaking softly. No one had passed by during the night. No drifters, no suspicious noises, no flashing lights to disturb the peace. A silent night. A good night.

Michael poured himself a coffee into his favorite mug—the chipped white one with the word California nearly worn off—and sat at the small folding table by the window. He stared outside, eyes still slow, breath steady. The desert air was warming up, but the light was still cold. In the distance, the hills were tinged with blue and orange. No movement. Just world.

He opened his notebook. It wasn’t a diary, not really. More like a jumbled archive of thoughts, possible titles, song lyrics, schedules, notes. An orderly chaos only he could navigate. He flipped back to the previous day’s page. Three cities circled: Flagstaff, Zion, Page. Then a straight line underneath. And below that, a phrase: If you don’t leave, you find yourself.

He couldn’t remember if it was a quote or something he’d written himself. But he liked it.

He had left his family at eighteen, with a backpack and a vague idea of freedom. Not after a fight, not as part of some grand escape. Just because he knew that if he stayed, he’d stop breathing. Since then, he had done a bit of everything: waiting tables, construction, moving jobs. And then music, writing. Freelance by necessity, but also by nature. He couldn’t stay still, nor feel part of anything. But he didn’t complain. That life, even if lived on the margins, was his.

The camper was his refuge. Not big, but perfect. Inside were him, his guitar, his laptop, a small kitchen where he made Italian dishes—the sauce with dried basil he brought from home, good pasta from the best-stocked markets—and a small but convenient bathroom. He had learned to live well in little space. It made him feel safe. From the outside, he looked like a man on a journey. From the inside, he felt like a spectator with a window on the world.

He played an old MP3. An acoustic album—slow guitars, a hoarse voice. Real folk. He liked starting his day with that music on. No rush, no anxiety. Just the road, and the sound of tires on asphalt.

He checked the water tank, tightened the bottle caps, closed the drawers. Simple but vital rituals. A way of telling himself everything was under control. The chaos outside couldn’t get in. At least not yet.

He washed his face in the narrow sink, ran his fingers through his hair, then opened the camper door and breathed in the morning air. It was dry, clean, with a dusty aftertaste. He lit a cigarette and sat on the camper’s steps. Watching the empty road. In that moment, he thought, everything was perfect.

But even in perfection, there’s always something off. A distant sound, a strange smell, a shadow moving just beyond the sunlight. Michael wasn’t paranoid. But he observed. Always. And lately, he had been noticing things. Subtle things. People with empty stares. Children too quiet. Songs on the radio with lyrics he didn’t recognize, even though they were “classic hits.” Nothing huge. Just an underlying dissonance. Like the world had lost its tuning.

He stubbed out the cigarette in the sand, climbed back in, shut the door. Sat in the driver’s seat. The keys were already in the ignition. The camper started on the first try. That hum always gave him a sense of security. It was like confirmation: we’re still here.

The passenger window rattled. A sound he knew well. It had been like that for years, and he’d chosen not to fix it. He liked it. It was like a little bell announcing the beginning of something.

He drove off slowly. The road stretched ahead of him, smooth and silent. No specific destination. Just a vague idea: west, maybe north, then who knows. The GPS was off. He didn’t need it. Follow the sun, listen to his gut, stop when the landscape spoke to him. It had always been like that.

As he drove, he recalled a phrase he’d read some time ago: The world never stops falling, it just changes how it does it. He hadn’t understood it then. Now it felt perfect.

Behind him, the desert returned to silence. Ahead, the asphalt shimmered just slightly under the rising sun. Michael put his hand out the window, felt the warm air brush his fingers.

He was on the road again.

And somewhere, the world was beginning to crumble.
But not yet.
Not here.
Not today.


Chapter 2 – Skye

The road had narrowed as the sun dipped behind the jagged line of the mountains. Michael had been driving for hours with no clear destination, letting himself be pulled by the landscape and the slow rhythm of the music playing through the camper’s small speakers. A forum for solo travelers had mentioned a free area for extended stays—no hookups, no surveillance, just trees, dirt, and a few scattered campfires.

He arrived around evening. The space was framed by tall, slender pines, the ground dark and compact, marked by the tires of other nomads who’d passed through. Three vehicles were already parked: a large white RV with a covered windshield, a trailer hitched to a pickup, and an old sand-colored Volkswagen bus with floral drawings and foggy windows.

Michael turned off the engine and stepped out. The air was fresh and clean, carrying the resinous scent of the forest mixed with wood smoke. The sky was already fading into a dirty orange.

He lit the camper’s stove and started preparing dinner: pasta, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, oregano. It was one of the few dishes he took with him everywhere. A kind of ritual, something familiar in the chaos of the road. As the water boiled, a figure approached from the left, barefoot, holding a mug.

“Got any salt?” asked the woman, with a smile that seemed to fold in on itself.

Michael looked at her for a moment. Light red hair tied in a loose braid, pale eyes—tired and cheerful at once. She wore loose pants, a worn-out sweater, and a colorful scarf knotted at her wrist.

“Sure.” He turned, took a small container from the cabinet inside, and handed it to her. “Here.”

“Thanks. I ran out three states ago. I always say I need to buy more, but then I forget. I find it easier to remember the stars than my grocery list.”

Michael gave a half-smile. “Michael.”

She held up the salt like it was a trophy. “Skye.”

The silence between them wasn’t awkward. It felt like the kind of silence that comes after something true—something that doesn’t need to be filled.

“You cook well, Michael. Or at least everything smells amazing.”

“It’s all a front. The taste is another story.”

Skye laughed softly. “Sometimes just the illusion is enough.”

She lingered a second longer, then slowly returned to her van. Her steps were light, almost like a dance, and her hands were full. Before climbing back in, she turned and gave a small wave—somewhere between a goodbye and a see-you-later.

Michael ate outside, a fork in one hand and a book in the other. But his reading was distracted. Every so often, he glanced toward the sand-colored Volkswagen, where the light inside shifted faintly.

When the darkness deepened, he picked up his guitar and sat near the small fire he had lit. He brushed the strings, tuned them slowly, then began to play. A slow folk tune, with lyrics about departures, voices in motels, stations without schedules.

The melody floated through the cold air like smoke. When he looked up, Skye was there, sitting on the ground, legs crossed, hands wrapped around a mug. She hadn’t said anything. She had just appeared.

“Is it yours?” she asked once he finished.

“Yeah.”

She nodded. “It’s beautiful. Sad, but beautiful.”

Michael shrugged. “Like you?”

Skye smiled without showing her teeth. “Sometimes. But not always. It changes every day—like the wind.”

Another silence. This one deeper. Michael felt no need to speak. She seemed to float in the moment, as if she weren’t in any rush to be anywhere.

“Do you travel alone?” he asked finally.

“Yeah. Always. Travel partners either leave eventually… or stay too long.”

He nodded, understanding exactly what she meant.

“And you? Where are you headed?”

“Nowhere specific.”

“Then we’re alike.” She sipped from her mug. “Or maybe not. I’m not looking for anything. You seem like someone who’s searching—even if you don’t want to admit it.”

Michael didn’t respond. He didn’t agree, but he didn’t disagree either. He’d learned that some phrases were better left floating.

When Skye stood, the fire was nearly ash. She took a step back, then looked at him. “Tomorrow morning I’ll make you coffee. I brew it strong, no sugar. Sound good?”

“Sounds good.”

“Goodnight, Michael.”

“Goodnight, Skye.”

He watched her go back into the van. She closed the door gently, like closing a book.

That night, Michael stayed up longer than usual. Not out of insomnia, but because it felt like something had shifted direction.
It wasn’t love. It wasn’t need.
It was a living curiosity.
And maybe, just maybe—
a little bit of relief.


Chapter 3 – Shortwave

The morning began with a different kind of silence. Not the quiet, familiar kind Michael knew well, but one slightly tilted, as if the air were holding its breath.

Skye was already outside when he opened the camper’s door. She sat on the roof of her Volkswagen van, legs dangling, a mug in her hands. The sun hit her light red hair, making it look almost transparent.

“Coffee’s ready,” she said, without turning around.

Michael climbed down and walked over. Her stove was lit on a small camping table, next to a jar of sugar and a crumpled packet of cookies. She handed him a metal cup, hot and steaming. Strong, bitter—just like she’d promised.

They drank in silence. The forest was waking slowly, without urgency. A few birds, a faint breeze, the good smell of coffee mixing with dirt and resin.

“I’m heading north today,” Michael said.

Skye finished her cup and set it beside her on the roof. “I like the north. I’m heading there too.”

It wasn’t a proposal. It was information. But he understood.

“You got CB radio?”

She smiled. “Of course. You’re not the only romantic in the world.”

**

They left an hour later, each in their own vehicle. Michael in front, Skye behind. The Volkswagen would occasionally slow down, then speed up, as if dancing with the road. They drove along a secondary highway, parallel to the main one, but far emptier. They passed dead towns, shuttered gas stations, signs long since gone dark. Every now and then, a tilted road sign, an abandoned church, a car sitting still with tall grass growing around it like a shroud.

Michael turned on the CB radio. Frequency 14.3. White noise, then a click.

“Do you see me?” he said, pressing the button.

A few seconds of silence. Then her voice—warm and relaxed. “I’m following you. Don’t try to lose me.”

He smiled. “If you pass me, honk twice.”

“And if I get bored, I’ll sing a song.”

Sometimes they talked. Other times, they went miles in silence. Skye told absurd stories: about a man who lived in a lighthouse in the middle of the desert, a pirate radio station that broadcast only whale sounds, a ghost town where the road signs changed every night. Michael never knew if she was making them up or not. But her stories kept him company. They were better than traffic. Better than the news.

They stopped in a small gravel lot beside a field of dry wheat. The wind moved the stalks like slow waves. Michael pulled out his folding table, Skye made pancakes with what she had. They ate sitting on the ground, in the shade of a gnarled tree, while the sun slowly descended.

“Have you noticed how the way people look at each other has changed?” she asked, finishing her plate.

Michael nodded. “Yeah. It’s like we don’t see each other anymore. Or we see too much.”

“I prefer not to be seen too clearly.” She looked toward the field. “When people start acting weird, the trick is to seem weirder than they are.”

**

They hit the road again.

A few hours later, near sunset, they arrived in an anonymous little town. Two main streets, a diner, a gas pump, a school with windows covered by sheets. They parked in a pullout at the town’s entrance.

“Quick stop?” Michael asked over the radio.

“Only if there’s coffee,” she replied.

They walked down the street without talking. Skye seemed more alert than usual. She watched everything, but didn’t make it seem suspicious. It was like she was recording the world with a light, drifting gaze.

They entered the diner. A sweet, heavy smell—like burnt caramel. The radio inside played soft swing music. Customers at tables, smiling waiters, warm lights. Everything seemed perfectly normal.

And yet.

Michael noticed an elderly woman at the counter. She was talking to herself, but not muttering—speaking loudly, as if having a full conversation. Yet no one responded. No one looked at her.

In a corner, two teenagers laughed as one showed the other a fresh wound on his arm, still bleeding through his sweatshirt. They laughed like it was a joke. The waiter came over, looked at the blood, and said, “Guys, no ketchup at the table. You know the rules.” Then he walked away.

Michael felt a knot rise in his stomach. He looked at Skye.

She was watching the scene—but without fear.

“You see it?” he murmured.

“Yes.”

**

They left without ordering anything. Walked slowly back to their vehicles. The town kept functioning, but something was off. As if behind every smile was a mask, behind every joke an untreated wound.

Once safely back in their respective vehicles, he turned on the CB radio.

“Feel like driving a little more?”

“Yes,” she replied. “At night, the wrong reflections show up better.”

They set off again. Michael checked his mirror often, just to make sure the sand-colored van was still there. And it was—always. A constant glow in the night, always the same distance behind.

That evening, they stopped in a dirt lot by a lake. The water’s reflection was black, opaque, but calm. Headlights off, just the soft crackling of the cooling engine.

They sat on the steps of their respective vehicles, facing the water. Each with a cup, something strong inside. No music. No words for a while.

“Do you think it’ll get worse?” Michael asked.

Skye nodded. “It’s not something that ends. It’s something that changes form.”

“And us?”

She looked at the lake. “We try to stay who we are.”

Michael stayed quiet. He wasn’t sure he could.

That night, in his bunk, he listened to the wind against the metal. The soft whine between the seams in the roof. Now and then, he turned on the CB radio—just to hear the static. Then, once, around three a.m., Skye’s voice:

“You awake?”

Michael pressed the button. “Yeah.”

Silence for three seconds. Then she simply said:
“Don’t dream too loudly. You might wake someone.”

End of transmission.

Michael closed his eyes and thought:
I’m not alone.
But I’m not safe either.


Chapter 4 – Colored Desert

The camper’s wheels kicked up red dust as Michael slowly drove down a dirt road, miles from anything that could be called a “town.” The sky above them was such a pale blue it almost looked unreal, and the sun fell at an angle, casting long shadows over the scattered boulders along the track.

Behind him, in her usual unsteady dance, Skye’s Volkswagen van followed like a thought that never quite leaves you. They’d heard about the place from an elderly couple at a gas station. “There’s a plateau nearby,” they’d said. “No one goes there anymore. But the view… it’s like looking inside God.”

Skye had smiled at that story. And now they were going to see if it was true.

They drove for another half hour until the road literally ended in a clearing of hard-packed earth framed by flat rocks and red sand. The horizon was infinite. The valley opened like a mouth toward the west, and the sky seemed to stretch to let it pass.

Michael turned off the engine. He listened to the hot ticking of the motor cooling down and, for a moment, just the wind.

Skye parked next to him. She got out of the van barefoot, wearing a loose striped shirt and cropped pants. She carried two bottles of water and a bag of peanuts.

“This is one of those places where you either stay a day… or never leave,” she said, looking around.

Michael nodded. “Let’s stay a day.”

He laid out his guitar on a blanket, along with a pillow and a couple of notebooks. Skye set up a little corner with candles and incense that smelled of sandalwood and lavender. The sun began to dip behind the rocks. The air grew colder, but the sky still burned, like someone had rushed to paint it with their hands.

They lay side by side without touching, their heads resting on backpacks. Soft music played from Skye’s small Bluetooth speaker. It was an old folk tune, with banjo and a hoarse voice, but it felt like it had been written for that exact moment.

“Ever think maybe all this running to stand still was a lie?” Skye asked, staring at the clouds.

“What do you mean?”

“Cities, houses, bills, contracts. All that chaos. For what? To feel safe? I feel safer here.”

Michael breathed slowly. “I feel more real here.”

She turned to look at him. “I never asked why you chose to live like this. Why you ran, I mean.”

“I never said I ran.”

“No, but you did.”

Michael thought about it. “Maybe I didn’t want to keep asking questions that had no answers. This…” he motioned to the view, “is the only thing that answers me. Always the same way.”

Skye smiled. “I travel so I don’t have to hear the answers I already know.”

They didn’t speak for a while. Just wind, and the changing colors of the sky. Sunset came in silence, almost respectfully. Blue turned to pink, then orange, then dirty gold. The earth beneath them seemed to breathe.

Michael picked up his guitar. He played something new, with full, slow chords. Skye closed her eyes, nodding gently, like she was rocking something inside. When he stopped, she stayed silent for a few more seconds.

“Is that yours?” she asked.

“Just born.”

“Sounds old. In a good way.”

“Maybe it is. Some songs aren’t new even when you write them.”

She turned toward him. “Will you let me read something? From what you write.”

Michael hesitated. Then he handed her a notebook. Skye opened it and read for a while in the fading light. Then she closed it and gave it back without saying anything. But her eyes were shining.

“It’s like you talked to me in my sleep,” she said. “And I’m not sure if I dreamed it or not.”

Night fell all at once. They lit a small fire and boiled water for tea. The sky filled with stars—a carpet of light. In the distance, a fox cried out.

Skye picked up a stick and began drawing something in the sand. Concentric circles, jagged lines, symbols without obvious meaning.

“What is it?” Michael asked.

“I don’t know. I’ve done it since I was a kid. I draw when I don’t know what to say.”

“And what don’t you know how to say now?”

She looked at the sky. “How alive I feel, maybe. And how much I know it won’t last.”

Michael handed her a blanket. They moved a little closer, their shoulders barely touching. They watched the sky for long minutes without speaking. Then she began pointing out the constellations.

“That’s Andromeda. And that’s Cassiopeia. And there’s Vega, my favorite. Looks small, but if you got close… it would burn everything.”

“Kind of like you.”

She laughed. “Careful. Not all stars are stable.”

Late at night, with the fire reduced to ashes and the silence full again, Michael turned on the CB radio just to see if any frequencies were still alive. Just static.

Then Skye’s voice: “If we don’t find anything tomorrow… will we come back here?”

“Yes.”

“Alright. Goodnight, Michael.”

“Goodnight, Skye.”

He stayed awake a little longer, staring at the sky from the camper window, his guitar still on his lap. He thought there was something sacred in moments where nothing happens.
And maybe, in the emptiness, the truest things were hiding.


Chapter 5 – A Rainy Day

It had been raining for hours. A steady, heavy rain that had erased the horizon and cast a gray film over everything.

Michael woke in his camper to the sound of water drumming rhythmically on the roof. The air inside was cold, damp. He looked out through the fogged windshield: they were parked in a small lot on the outskirts of a town called Leora, somewhere in northern Arizona, maybe already in New Mexico. No clear signs, no visible center. Just low houses, closed shutters, and a half-shuttered gas station.

He turned on the CB radio.

“You awake?”

A few seconds later, Skye’s voice.

“I’m watching the rain. Haven’t decided yet if I like it.”

Michael exhaled softly. “Let’s stay put today. Too much rain.”

“Yeah. Feels like a slow day.”

A little later, they met outside, under the rusted awning of the old minimarket next to the station. Skye wore a faded rain jacket, her hair wet, a thermos in hand. She handed him a cup.

“It’s instant, but it’s warm.”

Michael took a sip. Bitter, but real.

“There’s a library down the street,” she said. “At least something’s open.”

They walked in silence along the wet sidewalk. The streets were deserted. No dogs, no kids, no sounds. Just the ticking of the rain on roofs and gutters.

The library was a simple concrete building, with a faded sign. Inside it was warm, clean, lit by flickering fluorescents. A woman at the reception greeted them with an overly wide smile.

“Good morning! Looking for anything in particular?”

“Just a dry place,” Skye said.

“Then you’ve come to the right one. It’s quiet today.”

Michael nodded in thanks. The woman didn’t stop smiling, even as she turned back to typing on her computer.

They wandered separately through the shelves. Michael stopped in the travel section. He picked up a book about RV routes in the American Southwest. Flipping through it, he noticed that Leora wasn’t listed. But he didn’t think much of it.

Ten minutes later, he found her.

Skye was sitting in an armchair in the children’s section, a book open in her hands. Next to her, a girl of about seven. She stared straight ahead, expressionless.

“She was already here when I sat down,” Skye whispered. “She hasn’t said a word. Hasn’t moved.”

Michael studied the girl. She didn’t blink. Showed no interest in the book. No fear. No curiosity.

“Is your father here with you?” he asked.

No response. Not even a glance.

“Let’s go,” he said quietly.

Skye closed the book. The girl didn’t react.

They left the library. Under the rain, they turned to look back at the building. The woman at the desk was watching them through the glass. Still smiling. Far too wide.

They walked to a small diner two blocks away. Yellow lights, the smell of grease and coffee. Inside, three customers and a waitress in a clean uniform, her gaze empty.

“What can I get you?” she asked, without energy.

“Two coffees.”

She nodded and went back to the counter.

Michael watched the customers. Two men were talking, but far too softly—almost whispering. The other, sitting by the window, stared outside. Didn’t move. Not even when the coffee was placed in front of him.

“Do you feel okay here?” Skye asked.

“No. You?”

She shook her head. “There’s something… off. I don’t know how else to say it. Like everything’s on pause.”

Michael jotted something down in his notebook, without thinking too much:
People here don’t behave badly. They just don’t behave. Period.

They drank quickly. Didn’t eat. Returned to their vehicles.

That afternoon, the rain eased, but didn’t stop. The sky stayed low, heavy. Michael remained inside the camper, Skye in her van. But the CB radio stayed on.

“Michael…” she said after a while.

“Yeah?”

“Today was the first time I actually felt scared. And there wasn’t even anything… tangible.”

“Same here. That’s exactly the problem.”

Silence.

Then: “I don’t want to get caught in something I don’t understand. If something weird happens…”

“We’ll face it together,” he said, cutting her off.

Another long pause. Then Skye, softer:

“Okay. Thanks.”

The radio stayed on for a long time after that, but neither of them said anything more.

Outside, the rain continued.
And the world, apparently, was still there.


Chapter 6 – Rain and Appalachia

It had been raining for five days. Not in bursts, not violently. Just a constant, steady rain, falling without pause—as if the sky had grown tired of holding everything in.

Michael and Skye were still in Leora, parked in the same gravel lot next to a small, abandoned strip mall. Camper and van side by side, separated only by a stretch of puddles that never dried.

The rain had become a habit. The sound on the camper’s roof no longer woke him; it accompanied him. But outside, something was changing. Slowly.

Nothing had happened the first two nights. They slept, cooked, talked over the radio, shared hot food and cigarettes under the rusted awning of the closed market. But on the third evening, Michael saw a man standing on the sidewalk, in the rain. He had been there for hours. Not moving. Not asking for anything. No one looked at him. The next day, he was gone.

The town seemed to accept it. Just like it accepted the sky, the humidity, the moldy smell that now even crept into the food. The few residents moved slowly, spoke little, and when they did, it sounded like they were reading lines from a worn-out script.

Skye was growing restless. The rain made her feel trapped. She had stopped talking about stars and had started counting the days out loud.

“Five. Five days stuck. That’s too much,” she said on the morning of the sixth.

“You got something in mind?” Michael asked, handing her a plate of scrambled eggs he’d cooked on the camper stove.

“No. But we can’t rot here.”

That same afternoon, someone knocked on the camper window.

Three firm knocks.

Michael set down his cup and stood slowly. He pulled back the curtain. Outside, in the rain, stood a man in his forties—short beard, black windbreaker, direct gaze. He didn’t look like someone from Leora. His SUV, a muddy Jeep, was parked a bit further off, half-covered by a green tarp.

Michael opened the door.

“I’m not selling anything, don’t worry,” the man said. “I saw you’ve been here a while. I just wanted to talk to someone whose eyes still seem awake.”

Michael studied him for a second. “Got a name?”

“Nathan.”

Michael nodded. “Wait here.”

He turned on the CB. “Skye, come over. We’ve got company.”

A few minutes later, the three of them sat under the old minimarket awning—folding chairs, hot coffee in thermoses, and a worn blanket draped over Skye’s legs. The rain kept falling, steady like a broken faucet.

Nathan was calm. He spoke in a low voice, unhurried. He said he was from Tennessee, had been traveling for months, and that Leora was just one of many towns where things had stopped making sense.

“What do you mean, things don’t make sense?” Skye asked.

Nathan sighed. “Have you noticed how people stopped looking at each other? They walk close together, but they’re alone. No one reacts if someone falls, screams, laughs. It’s like we’ve lost the reflex.”

Michael listened in silence. He smelled a thread of truth in those words. There were no corpses in the streets, no visible emergencies. But there was a new apathy. A stillness scarier than any scream.

“There’s a place where it all began,” Nathan said after another sip. “Or so they say. The Appalachian Mountains.”

“The Appalachians?” Skye repeated. “What do they have to do with it?”

“They’re full of stories. Some as old as the earth. Others more recent. But all of them say one thing: that reality doesn’t quite work the same there. That there are places where natural laws… loosen.”

Michael leaned forward slightly. “What kind of stories?”

Nathan glanced around, then lowered his voice. “Things moving through the trees without a sound. Voices calling you in the voice of someone you know—even if you’re alone. Towns where everyone looks normal, but no one breathes. Or so it seems.”

Skye laughed nervously. “Sounds like an urban legend.”

“Maybe. But I’ve seen too much to believe it’s all just legend. The only difference over there is—they don’t pretend. Here, it’s worse. Everything pretends to be normal.”

They fell silent for a while.

The rain kept falling.

When Nathan left, he handed them a worn-out map, marked in pen. It pointed to a spot between West Virginia and North Carolina. “There are no official roads,” he said. “Only trails. But there… there’s something.”

⸻

That night, Michael stayed up later than usual. He reread his notes, listened to the rain, turned the CB radio on and off like he was waiting for a voice.

At midnight, he spoke.

“Skye.”

“Yeah.”

“Were you thinking about what Nathan said?”

“I haven’t stopped since he left.”

Pause.

“Would you go?”

“I don’t want to stay here. And you?”

“I’d rather go looking for something that makes sense than stay in a place that’s lost all trace of it.”

A longer pause.

“Leave tomorrow?” Skye asked.

“Yes.”

⸻

At eight the next morning, their engines were running. The rain was still falling, but it felt lighter now. Or maybe it only seemed that way because they had finally decided to leave.

Michael led the way, Skye followed. The road east was long, but they weren’t in a rush. Sometimes they talked over the CB, sometimes they stayed quiet. They listened to the radio, which played out-of-place songs: country gospel hymns, ads for products that didn’t exist anymore, news reports that seemed to come from the wrong day.

The world hadn’t stopped. It kept spinning. But increasingly out of sync.

⸻

They stopped at a rest area to eat something. Michael made rice with vegetables. Skye brought some bread she’d found at an old indoor market. They ate in silence until she said:

“If everything Nathan said is true… and we actually find something there… what do you think will happen?”

Michael looked her in the eyes.

“I don’t know. But maybe we’ll finally know where we are.”

“We’re on the road. Isn’t that enough?”

“Not anymore.”

Skye nodded. Gave a small smile. “Alright. Let’s go look for a world that at least has the courage to show itself.”

And so, with the rain behind them and the mountains ahead, they left.

Toward the Appalachians. Toward the legend.
Toward something that, perhaps for the first time, wasn’t pretending.


Chapter 7 – Warm Inside

It had been raining for days. Always the same way.
Not heavy, not chaotic. Just constant. A slow, fine, stubborn rain. It fell from a low gray sky, covering every landscape like a heavy sheet. The clouds had become a permanent ceiling, and the sun felt like something they had only dreamed of.

Michael drove with both hands steady on the wheel. The windshield was streaked with a thin film of condensation on the inside and raindrops on the outside. The wipers moved back and forth—tired but steady. Outside was cold, damp, blurred.
But inside… inside, it was warm.

The camper smelled of coffee, with a soft folk album playing in the background—something he’d downloaded years ago. The gas heater blew gently, spreading an even warmth. The fogged windows made him feel protected, as if he were traveling inside a house that breathed with him.

Behind him, in her usual position, was Skye. Her sand-colored van followed like a loyal shadow. Now and then they spoke over the CB radio, short phrases.

“Road holding up so far?” Michael asked.

“All smooth. I’m still alive, though my toes might disagree.”

Michael smiled. “I’ll bring you some tea at the next stop.”

“Deal.”

⸻

They stopped at a small rest area surrounded by pine trees. There was a soaked picnic table, a half-broken bench, and an overflowing trash can. But the ground was solid. And that was enough.

Michael pulled out the kettle and set it on the stove. Skye climbed in shortly after, a blanket around her shoulders and her hands already reaching for the heat.

“My turn to steal your house.”

“Welcome.”

They drank hot tea with honey in silence. Skye watched the rain fall in straight lines down the window.

“You know what’s nice about the rain?” she asked.

“What?”

“It forces you to stop. To do nothing. It leaves you alone with the things inside. But if you’re with the right person… it feels less heavy.”

Michael nodded. He watched the steam rise from their mugs, blend into the humid air, then disappear.

The camper was small, but it felt spacious when they weren’t moving. Curtains drawn, warm light, the guitar on the bed, dishes laid out to dry. A compressed life—but complete.

Skye set the blanket aside and started cooking. Rice with onion, canned chickpeas, turmeric. A made-up recipe, but the smell filled the space. Michael sliced bread, telling a story about the time he’d completely taken the wrong road and ended up sleeping next to a quarry, thinking it was a lake.

Skye laughed with her mouth full.

“You and navigation… a tragic love story.”

“Yeah, but with great plot twists.”

They ate sitting close together at the fold-out table bench. Outside, the rain fell harder, but the sound felt distant, muffled.

After dinner, Michael picked up the guitar and strummed something—a simple melody, without words. Skye lay down, her head resting on a pillow, eyes closed.

“Sounds like a warm room with closed windows,” she murmured.

“That’s exactly what it is.”

⸻

That night, they each slept in their own vehicle, but the CB radio stayed on. It had become a kind of thread between them. Just a click, a word, and the loneliness broke.

“Michael?”

“Yeah.”

“Today was one of those days where nothing really happens, but when it ends, you realize it fixed something inside.”

“Yeah. Same for me.”

Silence.

Then, her voice: “Thanks for being a warm place.”

Michael smiled in the dark.

“Goodnight, Skye.”

“Night.”


Chapter 8 – Unknown Frequency

Rain no longer had seasons.
It had been falling for hours with the same rhythm, unchanged, as if the sky had forgotten how to change.
Michael had been driving for three hours without saying a word. The road twisted like a slick snake through the pines. Every now and then, an abandoned farmhouse, a rusting car carcass, a gas station long out of service. The world was there, but empty. Like a film set left running after the movie was over.

There was no more music on the radio. Just empty waves, distorted signals, ads that sounded ten years old.

Skye was still following him. Behind, in her sand-colored van, headlights low, engine sounding more tired than the day before.

Just before sunset, they found a place to stop: an old gas station on the edge of a secondary highway, half-swallowed by vegetation. Broken windows, moss-covered pumps, a crooked sign. But there was space, and the tin roof would shelter both vehicles. It was enough.

Michael parked, turned off the engine, and let himself sink into the seat.
He reached for the CB radio. “We’ll stop here for the night.”

Skye’s voice came through seconds later, soft and distorted by static.
“This is the ugliest place we’ve found so far.”

“But it’s still.”

“So are cemeteries.”

He smiled. Her jokes kept him afloat, even in strange moments. And this place was strange.
The silence felt too thick. As if something — or someone — was listening.

⸻

After dinner, Michael cleaned up, lowered the curtains, and sat at the table with his notebook.
He wrote a few lines, crossed them out, started over.
Outside, the rain tapped at the windows like nervous fingers.
Inside, the heater blew gently, the light was warm, dim.

Behind him, the guitar rested on the bed. He’d turned on the radio out of habit.
Then off again.

He made himself a tea, wrapped up in a plaid blanket. Sleep came over him suddenly.
He closed his eyes on the bench seat, listening to the camper breathe. And drifted off.

⸻

He woke up at 2:43 AM, without knowing why.

There was no sound. No shake. Just… something in the air.
The rain still fell, but lighter. A muffled, constant sound. The kind that makes you feel alone.
But you aren’t.

Michael sat up, checked his watch instinctively. Looked outside: the windshield was a wall of fog.

Then he heard it.

A click.

Sharp. Artificial.
The CB radio turned on by itself.

A burst of white noise. Then a voice.

“Michael…”

A male voice. Not rough, not high-pitched. Just… cold. Calm. Too calm.

“Don’t turn around. There’s no one behind you. But I’m watching you anyway.”

Michael froze.
Hands on the table. Heart in his throat.
The radio blinked on a channel he’d never used: 21.6

They always used 14.3. Always.

The voice returned.

“You like writing at night. Always with that little yellow light above your notebook.
It’s nice. Makes you seem… real.”

Michael stood slowly.
He didn’t respond.
He stared at the CB as if it might catch fire.

“No need to talk. Not now. We’ll do that later.”

Pause. Static.

“Skye is already awake. Even if she hasn’t realized it.”

Then silence.
The radio shut off by itself. No click. No shutdown sound.

Michael stayed still. He could hear the blood rushing in his ears.
He looked toward Skye’s van. The lights were off. No movement.

Then the radio came back on.
But it was Skye.

“Michael…”

“Yes.”

“Did you… did you hear something?”

“Yes.”

“A voice?”

“Yes.”

Silence.

Then her voice, lower: “It seemed like it knew everything.”

“Even about you.”

“Is it still out there?”

Michael looked around. Saw nothing.
“I don’t know.”

“Turn on a light. Just a small one. So… if something happens…”

Michael switched on the camper’s dimmest light.
Seconds later, a light came on inside Skye’s van too.

Two warm lanterns in the dark.
Two silent signals.

⸻

An hour passed. Maybe more.

Michael sat on the bed, eyes open, CB radio still on—but silent.
No more voices.
No explanations.

He wrote only three words in his notebook:

“It’s always listening.”

Then he turned everything off.
And closed his eyes.
Not to sleep.

1ksvahy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1ksvahy/woke_up_wrong/,Woke up Wrong,"I was having such a nice dream, and you were in it. Things felt back to normal, and you felt back to normal. It wasn’t anything special, just a quiet moment from the life we used to share. Just soft, familiar habits and the quiet comfort of someone who used to love me. It was also one of those rare dreams where I didn’t realize I was dreaming. 

Considering how poorly I’ve been sleeping lately, peaceful, dreaming, sleep was a welcome change. Especially one where I could visit a version of you who still smiled at me.

But then I woke up.
Jolted by sudden, rough rapping against the metal of my bedframe, harsh and jarring, like someone knocking on the bars of a cell. Which, all things considered, feels fitting.

I look over, and you’re standing there.

You used to wake me gently; make sure I took my meds, bring coffee some mornings, always soft-spoken and warm. A quiet little ritual of care.

But now, something’s off.
What’s in front of me isn’t you. It’s an echo, like ink bleeding through paper: a smudged copy that couldn’t quite capture the soul of the original. A flat, muddled shade where you used to be.

You don’t have to do this anymore. You never did.
It started because you offered, and said it made sense since you were always up first for work. You used to say it was just one more way you could dote on me. 

But I wonder now if you resented it.
If you’ve rewritten even that into something I demanded from you.
One more entry in the ledger where everything becomes my fault.
Like you’ve buried us in fog so thick you can’t even see the pieces of you that chose to stay, or care, or love me. It's easier that way, I guess, to pretend I held you back instead of facing what you did with your own two hands.

So now I’m just awake and alone, left staring at this imperfect ghost of you.
And all I can do is sit with the grief of it, and ask myself the same question I’ve been waking up with for months now:

It took a few weeks, but it was one of the most healing and loving pieces I’ve ever created.

1) IOVE that Ricardo wore the socks, if you remember last year he wore socks and she was so rude to him, him wearing them again is his way of telling her he doesn’t gaf what she has to say 😌 

2) why does nat feel the need to mention they have been planning to buy the mom an avacado tree? Who cares it’s literally a tree, she’s probably saying it over and over again in case Edith gets one 

3) are you serious? Giving Giana a tumbler for coffee and a plant? Of coarse she has to make this about herself, she’s the one obsessed with coffee and just because she’s in her planting era doesn’t mean Gianna is too 💀

4) I can see why Jake’s mom doesn’t like nat. Who gives bed sheets as a gift on Mother’s Day? That’s like giving a mom spatulas for her birthday. Mother’s Day is supposed to be something meaningful FOR THE MOM. In my opinion my husband and I like to buy our moms things that she would never buy for themselves. And the fact that they couldn’t even stop by the store to at least put it in a gift bag

5) the energy at Jake’s house is so off, IK they only put like 5 mins into the video but they say they got there at 4 and when they left the sun was still up, they were probably only there for like 2 hours but I don’t blame them it was so weird just watching the video ",7,1747931348.0,nathalycuevas_snark,0,1.0,False

Hiding his phone, working “late,” and just being... off. I asked him if something was wrong, and he kept saying, “You’re imagining things.” But my gut told me otherwise.

I didn’t want to jump to conclusions, so I hired a private investigator. I felt awful about it, but I needed the truth.

A week later, the PI sends me pictures.

My husband... wasn’t cheating.

He was sneaking out to build me a tiny art studio in a friend’s backyard. It was supposed to be a surprise for my birthday. He even had fairy lights, a mini coffee bar, the whole thing.

I was stunned. And guilty. And then I had to figure out how to explain to him why I knew.

So I told him.

He laughed. Then he said, “You seriously thought I’d cheat on you? Babe, I can’t even lie about what I ate for lunch.”

We hugged. I cried. And now I have the most beautiful studio I never knew I needed.

One coat packs a punch, but I’ll slap it on like balm because it feels great. It will leave an echo of color when it fades. I also have the color Joyful in this formulation and when it’s gone, it’s gone, but that one’s pretty close to my natural lip color. 

This will kiss off onto coffee cups and water bottles, but it doesn’t spread to my lower lip or Cupid’s bow.

I’m a 29-year-old guy trying to make sense of life, one existential dread at a time. I’m an introvert with a resting “why so serious?” face, but around the right people, I can be the loudest one in the room (or at least the one with the most awkward jokes).  

Here’s the deal: I’m not entirely sure what I’m looking for, but I know I could use a friend right now. Someone to talk to about the big things (life, art, mental health, why Arsenal refuses to win the EPL) and the little things (what you cooked today, that song you can’t stop looping, or how you survived Monday without caffeine). If we vibe, I’m open to seeing where it goes—whether that’s a deeper connection, a relationship, or just someone to share memes and comfortable silences with.  

A bit about me:  

- Music: Kendrick, JID, and the new Carti album on loop. If you’re into music that hits the soul, we’ll get along.  
- Health: 2023 taught me that health is everything. I’m into gymming, eating clean, and sleeping like it’s my job. But I also enjoy getting high occasionally (once or twice a month) to just *exist* without overthinking.  
- Hobbies: Cooking is my therapy, coffee is my fuel (the darker, the better), and I have a soft spot for psychedelic art and deep conversations.  
- Humor: Dark, witty, and sarcastic. If you can handle awkward jokes and existential rants, we’re golden.  
- Travel: Long hikes and spontaneous trips are my mood boosters. Bonus points if you’re into deep, emotional, or spiritual conversations during sunsets.  

### What I’m looking for:  
- A nurturing, affectionate, and witty person who’s okay with my occasional shutdowns (I’m working on it, I promise).  
- Someone who’s passionate about *something*—art, poetry, music, or even their morning coffee ritual.  
- A two-way connection where we can talk about our days, dreams, and everything in between.  
- Bonus if you’re a football fan or if you can teach me to appreciate something new.  

I’m not here to rush into anything. Let’s start with a conversation and see where it goes. If you’re someone who’s kind, patient, and maybe a little lost too, hit me up. Let’s figure this life thing out together.  

P.S. If you’ve read this far, you’re already cooler than 90% of people I know. Slide into my DMs with your favorite song, a random fact, or just a “hi” if you’re feeling brave. Worst case? We have an awkward conversation. Best case? We create something real. Your move. 😊

Having been in survival mode for so long across thousands of miles of desert wilderness, I was mostly just glad for access to water. The restorative penumbra of blues and greens I hadn’t seen since the Peruvian Andes. Radiant shades of sapphire in all directions, with the lightest throws of snow atop the mountains. Clear rivers packed with so much glassy ice that they rang with a metallic chime when I dipped my bottles in for a fill.

Through Junin and San Martin, then Villa La Angostura and Nahuel Huapi. I serviced the bike’s drivetrain in Bariloche and followed the Old Patagonian Beer Trail west, a busy lakeside drive lined with a dozen or more small breweries and taprooms.

I was looking for a small harbor to begin the Cruce Andino, part of Che Guevara’s epic Andean traverse that connects three compact ferry hops with a wild backroad marathon between Chile and Argentina. Biking between bars until sunset, I guerrilla camped behind an old church while waiting for the first stage of boat crossings.

* the other showing how I made the eggshell wall art from scratch

Unfolded it.
One slow crinkle.

She levitated.
Did a 360.
Landed like she was confused what planet she was on. Then stormed out the room like I had wronged her.

I said nothing.
She’s been side eyeing the foil ever since.",3179,1747930738.0,pettyrevenge,109,0.95,False

I started smoking at the age of 16 (33 today) and have barely had a day without it since. When the whole vaping trend started, I switched to it in 2020 and was going through one disposable vape a day. I actually enjoyed it. Hiding my addiction even added a strange sense of excitement. As stupid as it sounds, keeping a secret that not even my wife knew gave me a weird kind of thrill.

I tried to quit many times, both before and after getting married, but I never succeeded, mainly because I didn’t truly want to. I enjoyed it too much. But then she found out. I promised to quit and genuinely tried, but ended up giving in again. She smelled it, confronted me, and once again I promised to quit. But I failed again. I gave in to the cravings.

Now I am at the edge. My marriage is on the line because of my addiction and the lies that came with it.

I quit two days ago, cold turkey, and I feel miserable. The cravings are real. I still cannot imagine life without it. I think about vacations, hiding in the bathroom, driving to the office with a coffee and a vape in hand. Those moments feel impossible to give up.

I want to use this post as a place to come back to whenever the cravings hit.

I truly hope I can succeed and save my marriage. If I fail, I feel like I will be completely lost.",2,1747930704.0,QuitVaping,3,1.0,False

1ksutyn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ksutyn,Cycling from Alaska to Argentina: The Old Patagonian Beer Trail,"There were over 1,500 miles to go with four more border crossings en route to the Antarctic Islands of Tierra del Fuego, but spotting my first signs for Patagonia still felt like an arrival of sorts.

Having been in survival mode for so long across thousands of miles of desert wilderness, I was mostly just glad for access to water. The restorative penumbra of blues and greens I hadn’t seen since the Peruvian Andes. Radiant shades of sapphire in all directions, with the lightest throws of snow atop the mountains. Clear rivers packed with so much glassy ice that they rang with a metallic chime when I dipped my bottles in for a fill.

Through Junin and San Martin, then Villa La Angostura and Nahuel Huapi. I serviced the bike’s drivetrain in Bariloche and followed the Old Patagonian Beer Trail west, a busy lakeside drive lined with a dozen or more small breweries and taprooms.

I was looking for a small harbor to begin the Cruce Andino, part of Che Guevara’s epic Andean traverse that connects three compact ferry hops with a wild backroad marathon between Chile and Argentina. Biking between bars until sunset, I guerrilla camped behind an old church while waiting for the first stage of boat crossings.

I’d been alone for so long that simply to be in the presence of people again felt preternatural. There were coffee bars and bakeries where I found the best baguette since southern Ecuador [a French expatriate in Vilcabamba]. I filled my panniers with as much bread and coffee stouts as I could carry, carb loading for more gravel ahead.",1,1747930693.0,xbiking,0,0.67,False
