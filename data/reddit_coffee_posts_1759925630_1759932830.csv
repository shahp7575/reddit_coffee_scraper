***Imogen Riley POV***

I groggily wake up, the sun just breaking through the windshield of my beat-up Honda civic. I stretch my body, trying to get into a comfortable position. For nearly three months, I have been living in my car, and my body is really starting to protest. Sitting up, I pull my blanket around myself, trying to warm my freezing cold skin. An empty vodka bottle falling off the seat and into the footwell of the passenger seat. Now I know what you are probably thinking: I’m an alcoholic. Well I’m not, nor do I ever drink and drive.

The first night I had to sleep in my car, it was minus three degrees. I was freezing. Luckily for me, my mother liked a few drinks, and seeing as I couldn’t leave flammable liquid in the storage locker where my stuff is currently stored, I had no choice but to leave the boxes of spirits in my car. The bottles of spirits inconveniently took up half my boot room. I wasn’t lying when I said she likes a drink.

I was going to dispose of it, but I’m now glad I didn’t. Her favourites were vodka, second by tequila. I wasn’t much of a drinker, watching her was enough to deter anyone from drinking. But on that freezing night, I decided why not. I grabbed a bottle hoping to help myself sleep and forget that I was now homeless and having to live in my car. So, decided it couldn’t hurt. My life was already at pretty crappy crossroads.

I learnt that night being drunk helped me get through the cold nights. You don’t feel the cold when you’re intoxicated, in fact you don’t feel much of anything. My alcohol tolerance has become rather impressive. I don’t drink myself to oblivion, but on nights like the first night I spent in this cramped car and like last night, I knock a few back to help chase away the cold.

I watch as the sun slowly comes up. There is one plus side to living in your car. I am never late to work, seeing as I am currently living in the workplace parking lot. No one knows but the janitor Tom. He is a sixty-year-old man, who is balding on top, has kind eyes and cuddly figure, and he has grandfatherly nature.

He stumbled upon me sleeping in my car one night. I told him it was only temporary, so he has kept my secret between us. My bosses just think I’m an eager enthusiastic worker. I am always the first person to work besides Tom, who opens the car park and the building, and I’m always the last to leave. I am not going to correct them; they can think whatever they like. I need this Job.

Reaching for the ignition, I turn my car over, my phone instantly lighting up and charging through the lighter socket. It is 7am. Getting up I lean over the passenger side and grab my outfit for the day that is hanging from the hand hold on the roof above the door.

Sliding my seat all the way back, I slide my track pants off and grab my panties. Sliding them up my legs before putting my black suit pants on and buttoning them up. I then grab my bra, and ducking down behind the steering wheel, I quickly rip my shirt off and clasp my bra into place before putting my white button up blouse on.

I just finished slipping my heels on when I see Tom walking up the driveway to the top level of the parking lot. Swinging my door open, I greet him.

“Hey Tom,” I say, waving at him before reaching in and grabbing my handbag from the passenger seat. Tom walked over holding two paper cups. My favourite part of the morning, it has kind of become a morning ritual. Every morning Tom walks all the way to the top level of the car park, brings me a coffee, and we both walk back down to the entry together.

“Hi love, how was your night?” Tom asks, concerned.

“It was fine, bit chilly but nothing I’m not used to by now,” I tell him, grabbing the cup from his hand.

“You know you can always stay…”

I cut him off before he can continue.

“Tom, I know, but really I’m fine. This is only temporary.”

He shakes his head, having heard the same excuse every morning for the last few months. He knows there is no use arguing with me. I’m too stubborn and am not one for accepting help. Tom continues to the door before punching in the security code to let us into the building. He offers for me to stay with him and his wife, but I don’t want to intrude and it’s not so bad here. It is a lot safer here then the park I was originally parked at.

Tom lets me in early every morning. I usually go straight upstairs to my desk, which is conveniently directly in front of the air conditioner. Catching the lift to the top floor, I step out and into the foyer and walk to my desk, my heels clicking on the marble floors. Grabbing the AC remote, I turn the heater up full blast and stand directly under it, warming myself up while I sip my coffee.

Once I’m warmed up, I sit at my desk and start up my laptop and look over the today’s schedule and any notes I have left myself. I have been working at Kane and Madden industries for about 12 months now. I am a secretary for Theo Madden and Tobias Kane. They own the tech company, and I’m about 98 percent sure they are a couple. Not that I have seen them together or anything. They have separate offices, but they have this way of communicating. They always seem so in sync with each other, and I have caught them staring weirdly at each other. I have also walked in on Theo kissing and sucking on Tobias’s neck.

I must admit it was hot, and it’s kind of turned me on until Tobias noticed me standing gawking, which made Theo freeze, and then It got awkward and tense. I ran from the room. They never mentioned it, so I assumed I was let off the hook. I added that memory to the it never happened file of my brain.

It’s a shame they are both gay. They are the hottest gay couple I have ever seen. Both muscular and tall, Tobias is the more imposing one he seems to be the more serious and sometimes I get these chilling vibes off him that send shivers down my spine from the intensity of his gaze. Sometimes when he is speaking to me, he gets this far away expression on his face like he is looking straight through me instead of at me. I swear one time, I thought I heard him growl at me. But I know that’s insane. People don’t growl, not like a predator does. I put it down to the 18 hours shift I did that day.

Tobias Kane is tall dark haired and muscular 5 o’clock shadow strong jaw and sharp piercing blue eyes. Theo Madden on the other hand has softer features. He is just as tall as Tobias but has a very casual laid-back attitude and brown hair that’s short on the sides and a little longer on top. He has grey eyes and high cheekbones. Both are breathtakingly handsome. Even after all this time working here, I still get stunned by their godlike appearances.

I’m incredibly surprised I haven’t been fired; I have been caught way too many times daydreaming, staring off into space having very inappropriate thoughts about my bosses. But I also know I’m extremely good at my job. No one has lasted this long as their secretary, and no one is willing to do the sometimes-crazy hours I have endured in my position.

Once I finished checking my laptop, I checked the time. It was 8:30 AM. I still had half an hour before my bosses arrived. Slipping out of my seat, I walked to the bathroom with my handbag. I set my make up on the counter and pulled my brush out. I started to brush my unruly waist length blonde hair. After deciding to pull it into a high ponytail, I grabbed my toothbrush and toothpaste and quickly brushed my teeth. I also applied some mascara to my already long thick eyelashes and some eyeliner to brighten my dark green eyes before putting on some red lipstick. It contrasted nicely with my fair skin.

I am so glad this floor has no cameras because it would be so embarrassing if my bosses found out my morning routine. Plus they would see me in all my morning bedhead (or car head) glory. Tom doesn’t count. He doesn’t care what I look like, and I am always comfortable around him. But if anyone else saw me, I think it might be a bit awkward.

Once I am finished, I quickly duck into the small kitchenette and start getting their coffees ready for their arrival. I hear the elevator ding just as I finish making them. I place them on a tray and quickly walk back to my desk tray in hand.",1,1759932553.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

1o1bieh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BernieSanders/comments/1o1bieh/satire_this_is_why_we_need_to_compromise/,[SATIRE] This is why we need to compromise.,"**THIS IS SATIRE EXCEPT FOR THE LATER PARAGRAPHS**

We need to take back control from the elites. We want affordable health care for everyone. We want reproductive freedom that is not conditional. We want clean air, safe streets, and the kind of education system that does not leave students crying over tuition. These are not radical dreams. These are bare minimum human decencies.

But let’s be realistic. You can’t get elected on a platform that extreme. So maybe we just... compromise a little.

Let us compromise. Maybe “affordable health care for all” could mean “affordable-ish health care for some, depending on their network, employer, and what the state legislature wants.” That feels bipartisan. That feels balanced. That feels like something we could win voters on.

And of course we want reproductive freedom. But maybe we need to tone it down a little. Perhaps we should offer “limited reproductive freedom” where you can make your own medical choices if your state legislature allows you to. And if your state legislature doesn't allow women to make choices with their own body, they still have the freedom to take a risky trip to a different state that does. That way, someone who can afford to travel in that difficult time gets to have reproductive freedom, but others cannot. How democratic. This is why compromise is great.

And we need bold action on climate change. But let us not scare people with the word “bold.” Let's call it “measured enthusiasm for sustainability.” We can start with symbolic gestures, like banning plastic straws again. Actually, don't even ban them, because that's too much. Instead, let's hold summits where we talk about planting trees but spend three days in a conference hall with disposable coffee cups. Also, we need balance, so let's not vilify the oil companies. We need ExxonMobil on our side, since that's where the votes are. ExxonMobil will post another commercial of a child hugging a sunflower while an oil rig cries softly in the background. So that way, big energy companies know that we're still on their side, while we're trying to help the environment. This is what I mean when I say progress.

Now, while we are compromising, maybe we should modernize our image. Politics is theater now. You do not just need ideas. You need a look. Maybe it is time to get the hair. You know the one. The hair should be brassy blond combed forward from the back and swept across the forehead.

And to win elections, you have to master the attitude too. You have to interrupt people a lot. You have to be rude to journalists. You have to call them the worst names imaginable. Bonus points for racism and sexism.

Did I mention nicknames? Give everyone one. ""Low-Energy,"" ""Crooked,"" ""Sleepy,"" etc. Even your pets should have nicknames. That is how you create a brand. Voters do not want nuance. They want memes.

And you have to sell stuff. To win elections, you have to sell merch now. Hats, flags, NFTs, etc. I will release a clothing brand called “Policy Chic.""

Honestly, at this point, why stop pretending. Let us just elect the incumbent for a third term. We've already compromised so much. What's the difference now? He already has everything we want.

And look at us now. We started this conversation talking about fairness, freedom, and basic dignity. And here we are.

Jokes aside, maybe one side has been so scared of looking “too extreme” that we forgot that passion actually inspires people. The other side does not win because they are reasonable or moderate. The leader of their party went up against the ""moderates"" and kicked their asses really badly. We could learn something from that. Not the lies, but the audacity. The confidence to not back down from ""extreme ideas.""

And you know what? For our country, free public healthcare is an ""extreme"" idea. But just because it sounds extreme, doesn't mean we need to run away from it. Voters respond well when you don't back down.",1,1759932504.0,BernieSanders,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Some things to note there are HVAC vents on the floor on both sides of the window and two behind the couch sort of in the middle of the look through. A lot of people have suggested putting the tv on the small far wall but I don’t love looking sideways at a tv however that wall does feel so blank and idk what type of art might balance it out better. I think it’s a little too narrow to get a coffee table if we were to replace the seating with non-reclining furniture. I’m maybe willing to concede on the tv placement since we haven’t been watching too much tv since I had a baby anyway haha. The rocking chair used to not be there but was an expensive gift for the baby.

I think they were far apart initially. Now they are about once every 3 months.

When i was young i drank a lot of soda, coke cola, i feel this might have messed up my system. I used to have gas cramps and throw up even as a child 13-15 years old. I always thought it was cola. At some point i stopped cola and switched to drinking way too much gatorade which also was not good. Still had cramps.

In uni, i remember having a few episodes of gas and diarrhea also.

Currently, ive been a vegetarian for 10 years and have a healthy lifestyle. No soft drinks. Barely any alcohol. No coffee or black tea. No refined sugar.
Didnt do too much exercise for a while but im fit and resumed running and gym 2-3x a week for 3 months. All to say im pretty healthy.

Ive been to an alergist, she did a prick tedt and she said im mildly alergic to everything lol. Then a blood test said im alergic only to peas (which i cut out).

Still. Today. Once again. After about 3 months, i had an episode.

My bowl movements are in general good. Once per day. Sometimes a bit constipated but not much. Usually pasty or just normal.

My episodes are like many here. Usually in the morning. I wake up and go to the toilet. Then i feel i must go again, and cramps start. Then i feel like i i must evacuate everything in my intestines to get it over. It usually takes 3-4 toilet sessions with a lot of poop. It gets more watery as the sessions progress. Lots of stomach pain. Cold sweat. Sometimes passing out. 

This happens about every 3-4 months.

I dont know what to do.

Suggestions? Anyone similar?

1o1baxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/nichezero/comments/1o1baxs/niche_excellent_spare_parts_service/,Niche - excellent spare parts service,"I wanted to share my experience dealing with Niche Coffee customer service.

I have a Niche Zero coffee grinder which I bought at the start of 2021.

It's been great, much much better than the Sage grinder it replaced. The grind is more consistent, it's much easier to adjust, it looks and sounds better, it doesn't retain a bunch of stale grinds, and the design of the hopper and dosing cup is great. I really like that it can be stripped down for an occasional thorough cleaning. It is expensive but I can't imagine how you could make any practical improvement. The only thing I can think of is to include a bellows to blow out grinds in the box with the grinder. I suspect I'm preaching to the choir here.

A few months ago, after about four years of daily use by four people who love drinking coffee, something changed. I had been consistently grinding beans at about 12 for our espresso machine, but overnight it changed and I found I had to grind at about 21 to get the same results.

I took the machine apart (which is easy, just take out half a dozen screws) and gave it a good clean. Other than a bit of carbon dust from the motor brushes I found nothing noteworthy. The machine still worked fine and we just adjusted our grind settings and carried on.

Several months passed until a few weeks ago the grinder started to get noticeably noisier. I observed that the rotating burr would move smoothly when there were no beans in the machine, but would stall under load. It was also getting worse day by day. I figured the most likely fault was that a part in the gearbox was wearing - maybe a plastic gear was progressively losing teeth (I've not identified the root cause yet).

I sent Niche a short video to show them the problem on Friday morning. Within 10 minutes they wrote back and sent me a detailed PDF of instructions on how to take the machine apart and things to check for. I'd already done all of this and told them so. They then offered to send me a replacement motor and gearbox for the very reasonable price of £30 including next-day shipping.

Within under an hour of first reporting the problem I had replacement parts on the way to me - they must really love drinking coffee at Niche too!

The parts arrived this afternoon and took 30 minutes to fit (including thoroughly cleaning the machine). The grinder is fixed, it works and sounds like new again! The odd offset in grind setting has gone away and I'm back to grinding at 12 just like when the machine was new.

I wanted to share my experience because I find it is often difficult to source spare parts, the parts are outrageously expensive, or customer service is crap - taking weeks to respond, blindly following a script, or just not understanding the product they are supporting. None of this was my experience with Niche - they just seemed happy to help me fix my (out of warranty) machine.",1,1759932036.0,nichezero,0,1.0,False

I want my own family in the future very much so I know what I want in life,"
Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy.

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one!


Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don’t mind where you are located don’t let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life.

By Preston Dennett

All UFO encounters are interesting, but perhaps the most fascinating is when UFOs land and humanoids come out! Here are ten cases of UFO landings from across the world including the United States, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Spain, Norway, Finland, Scotland, France and England. They span over a period of five decades. They involve a wide variety of humanoid figures. Many are multiple witness cases. Almost all of them involve some form hard evidence such as landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, psychic effects and physiological reactions. Some include government involvement and even disturbing threats from apparent men in black.

JUL 23, 1947, PITANGA BRAZIL: Topographer Jose C. Higgins hears a high-pitched hum. Suddenly a metallic craft lands next to him and out come three beautiful ETs wearing weird spacesuits. Jose founds himself surrounded by them. To his relief, they appear to be friendly. Feeling fear, he retreats and watches them from a distance as they begin playing like small children.

AUG 1960, NEWCASTLE, NSW AUSTRALIA: Helen Aldridge is awakened by a buzzing noise coming from outside her home. Looking out the window, she sees a craft shaped like a toy top landing in her backyard. Out steps a humanoid dressed in an olive-green jumpsuit. To her shock, it climbs over her fence and approaches right up to her window.

JUL 31, 1966, PRESQUE ISLE STATE PARK, PA: When their car gets stuck in the sand, Gerald LaBelle goes for help, leaving behind Betty Klem, Doug Tibbets, Anita Haifley and her two children. Without warning, a UFO lands in the forest next to them. Police arrive and leave with Doug to investigate. At this point, a huge hairy humanoid emerges from the forest and attacks the car. Before long officers from Project Blue Book arrive to investigate.

AUG 29, 1967, CUSSAC, FRANCE: When 13-year-old Francois Delpeuch and his little sister Ann-Marie (age 9) go to retrieve the family cows, they come upon a huge glowing sphere and four small humanoids walking around beneath it. When they approach for a closer look, the strange beings notice the two children and begin floating one by one back into the craft.

FEB 5, 1971, KINNULA, FINLAND: Two forestry workers (Peter Aliranta and Esko Sneck) get the shock of their lives when a UFO lands next to them in the forest. A small 4-foot-tall being emerges and approaches Peter. When the being turns around to enter the craft, Peter rushes forward and grabs the ET by the foot. It’s a decision that he will regret for a long time.

NOV 14, 1976, WINCHESTER, ENGLAND: Joyce Bowles is driving home. Her friend Edwin Pratt is in the passenger seat. They are concerned to see a UFO dropping down from the sky ahead of them on the road. Suddenly their car steers itself off the road. When they finally get it to stop, they see a UFO blocking the roadway and humanoids looking out the windows at them. Then one emerges from the craft, walks right up to them and stares at them fixedly. Their strange adventure has only begun.

MAY 18, 1977, ELGIN, SCOTLAND: Karen McLennan and Fiona Morrison (both 10-years-old) are playing near their homes when they hear a soft humming noise in the woods. They go to investigate and come upon a landed craft. Standing next to it is a tall slender man dressed in a silvery jumpsuit. As the man walks towards them, the girls flee. When they turn around, they see the craft flying off. But when they get home, they learn there are more witnesses. And then the threats start coming in.

SEP 18, 1978, SAN GIORGIO DI NOGARO, ITALY: Railway employee Giorgio Filiputti only wants to enjoy a quiet day of fishing. But it’s not to be. He hears a strange noise and an odd breeze. Going to investigate, he comes upon a landed craft. A weird 4-foot-tall humanoid looks surprised to see Giorgio approach. He stares at Giorgio and begins to work on apparently repairing his craft.

NOV 24, 1978, GERENA, SPAIN: When four young men go hunting along the Guadiamar River, they get a lot more than they bargained for. Seeing strange lights in the forest, they come upon a landed UFO and a 7-foot-tall humanoid. The strange figure starts walking towards them. When it gets too close, the men run away in a panic. Later, strange land-traces are found.

JUL 25, 1981. STJORDAL, NORWAY: Hjordis Hokstad wants only to enjoy her morning coffee and watch the wild deer in the field behind her house. Instead she sees a landed UFO and a weird humanoid wearing a spacesuit walking around the craft. She grabs her binoculars and gets a nice close look. Little does she know, her neighbor is watching the whole thing from his house.

There is no more room for denial. The evidence for the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials is here for those with the courage to examine it. We are not alone! We are only one of many different humanoids in a universe teeming with intelligent life.

Later, strange land-traces are found.

JUL 25, 1981. STJORDAL, NORWAY: Hjordis Hokstad wants only to enjoy her morning coffee and watch the wild deer in the field behind her house. Instead she sees a landed UFO and a weird humanoid wearing a spacesuit walking around the craft. She grabs her binoculars and gets a nice close look. Little does she know, her neighbor is watching the whole thing from his house.

There is no more room for denial. The evidence for the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials is here for those with the courage to examine it. We are not alone! We are only one of many different humanoids in a universe teeming with intelligent life.

He walked inside and gestured to me to take off my AirPods. He then said “what you are doing is not the way. Jesus is the way.” He proceeded to ask if he could sit and tell me about Jesus. I said “no thank you.” He was still persistent but finally left after I refused to engage. I left the coffee shop. 
I’ve sat in this same coffee shop and others many times, and this is the first time this happened. While I wish to maintain the freedom to practice my interest peacefully in public, I might limit my readings to my home from now on. I’d appreciate any insight.

1o1b2be,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1o1b2be/rental_agreement_and_property_with_extra/,rental agreement and property with extra!,"Ex rental agreement and property

I shared an apartment with my partner for about a year. Before signing the lease, I made sure both of our names were included to protect myself, as there were already some concerns. Over time, things became difficult—both with work and in our relationship. A few months ago, she left to find work or “find herself,” but at the time, she said she planned to return.

While she was gone, I suffered a life-changing injury, and with everything going on, we ended things abruptly. Now, due to my disability, I need to move out.

My first concern is that she left a lot of her belongings behind—items like a brand-new TV, TV stand, coffee table, queen bed, childhood dressers, IKEA furniture, and various kitchenware. I asked her to take them when she left, but since she planned to come back, I didn’t push it. She’s made no effort to contact me, other than one missed phone call months ago. I don’t want to keep or dispose of her things unfairly, but I’m not sure what the right or legal thing to do is.

My second concern is financial. Over the year we lived together, she only paid rent once. I even gave her another month free as a gift. Would she still be legally responsible for the unpaid rent? The total amount owed would be just under the small claims court limit. She has acknowledged responsibility in a text as well.

At this point, I’d honestly prefer to have someone else handle this on my behalf, as I don’t want any direct contact with her. I hold no animosity toward her, but our time together left me with a lot of emotional trauma. Time is running out before I have to move, and I’m unsure where to start.

HOWEVER 
There was a time where she was being a real Karen with the neighbors downstairs and they were having like some sort of Cold War where they were like reporting each other and I was beside myself with embarrassment the entire time eventually they were cool but during that time the property management company apparently sent both of us an email that was like listen I don't know what you want us to do about this if you want you can just leave It's fine it's not breaking contract you can go at any time type thing 

Now that I'm trying to move out they're acting like that email never existed and that I'm going to owe them for an additional 2 weeks after I leave.

1o1b040,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1o1b040/1_week_and_its_getting_easier/,1 week and it’s getting easier,"I quit vaping about a week ago. Been vaping since covid and genuinely had no intention of quitting until a few months ago. Nothing really sparked it, I just was tired of looking at non vapers and wondering how they enjoy life. How they can have a drink and then go on with life. How they can exist and not be thinking about an adult pacifier. As someone who was restricted from a lot of things growing up, it felt like my little piece of rebellion that I could hide quite easily if I wanted. 

I decided to quit one day when my vape died and was sick and couldn’t leave the house, this led into a weekend where I had the space to go through the withdrawals and suffer through the worst part. Because trust me, it fucking sucks. But it’s temporary and I think a really important first step to proving to yourself you can stick to your word.   

I’m just starting to feel like myself again which in the first 3 days I really didn’t think was possible. People aren’t lying when they say the first few days are the hardest physically and mentally. It took a lot of willpower to not give up and just buy a vape. I was anxious, majority depressed, so angry and triggered by the smallest things, and just generally a miserable person to be around. 

To be honest the only thing that helped me through was thinking, ok if I did buy a vape I will have to go through this whole process again and I really can’t be bothered to experience the withdrawal more than once. I think the withdrawal is worse than the cravings. And after day 3 I woke up and felt more clear headed than I have in years. I feel alert and awake, and I’ve majorly cut down on coffee without even realizing. I also feel immensely proud of myself for getting through something really difficult. 

The cravings are still there but I’ve found I think about vaping when I remember that I haven’t thought about it. I don’t know if that will ever go away but the chokehold isn’t so bad. It’s hard to see other people vaping but they’re on their own journey and it’s not yours anymore. I have used a vape once or twice since quitting and it honestly made me feel AWFUL. Instant anxiety that took awhile to go away. Work is more enjoyable, I go hours without thinking about anything at all, something I really didn’t think was possible. 

If you are thinking of quitting or struggling with quitting, I’m with you. This shit is not easy but it is rewarding and it is doable. Truly. There will be no right time, you won’t be motivated when your vape finally died, you just have to suck it up and do it.

1o1aydy,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o1aydy/the_man_in_the_photo_album_isnt_related_to_usbut/,The Man in the Photo Album Isn’t Related to Us—But He’s in Every Picture,"When I was a kid, my mom kept a heavy leather photo album on the coffee table. Thick black pages, plastic sleeves, Polaroids tucked between brittle corners. I used to flip through it when she was cooking or when I was supposed to be doing homework. Back then, I thought of it as proof that our family was normal. Birthdays, Christmas mornings, summer trips to the lake—mundane and ordinary, but comforting.

I didn’t notice him at first.

Why would I? When you’re seven years old, you don’t scan every photo like a detective. You look for your face, your siblings’, the dog. But years later, when I was visiting home after college, I picked the book up again. Nostalgia, I guess.

That’s when I saw him.

He’s in every photo. Not in a way that jumps out immediately. Sometimes he’s in the background, leaning against a tree. Other times he’s at the edge of the frame, blurred by motion. Once, he’s sitting two rows back at my fifth birthday party, in the McDonald’s PlayPlace seating area, staring directly into the camera.

The strange thing is: I didn’t know him. My parents didn’t know him. Nobody in the family knew him.

I asked my mom, laughing at first, flipping the album around to show her.

“Who’s this guy? He’s everywhere. Look, he’s behind Aunt Claire in the Christmas photo. Then again at the lake. And here, at the carnival—”

She took the book from me. Her fingers froze on the page.

“That’s… just some stranger,” she said finally, snapping the cover shut. “You know how people wander into pictures. He’s probably just…a coincidence.”

But her tone wasn’t casual.

She put the album back on the shelf and didn’t let me look at it again that night.

I couldn’t stop thinking about it, though. I lay in my childhood bedroom, staring at the ceiling, trying to reconstruct the photos in my head. He wasn’t family. He wasn’t a friend. He didn’t even seem to age—his hair was always the same length, the same style. His clothes never really changed.

The more I thought about it, the more I realized he wasn’t just “in the background.” He was looking. Always at the camera. Always at us.

And now I can’t shake the thought: if he’s in every picture… then he was there. At every moment. Every holiday, every trip, every birthday. Standing close enough to be caught on film.

Which means he was always near us.

Watching.

The next morning, I brought it up again. Over coffee, I said,

“Mom, seriously—who was that guy in the photos? You knew everyone else at those parties. The neighbors, family friends. Why didn’t anyone ever mention him?”

She didn’t look at me. She stirred her cup with this slow, deliberate rhythm, like she was buying herself time. Finally, she said,

“You’re overthinking it. It’s just someone passing through. People photobomb all the time.”

But her voice cracked when she said photobomb.

I knew better than to push. My mom has that way of shutting a conversation down, pressing her lips together so tight you can hear the finality in it. Still, when she left for work, I went back to the bookshelf and pulled out the album.

I sat cross-legged on the floor, turning pages carefully, like the paper might disintegrate in my hands.

There he was.

Always there.

Christmas ’94 — behind the tree, only half his face visible in the branches.

Family reunion ’97 — across the picnic field, sitting alone on a bench.

My high school graduation — dead center in the bleachers, eyes locked on the camera.

It wasn’t just that he was in the photos. It was that he didn’t change. The same dark jacket. The same haircut. The same posture, straight-backed, hands clasped loosely in front. My uncle had gone from full head of hair to bald. My cousins had grown taller, acne giving way to clearer skin. Even the damn dog had aged.

But not him.

I tried to be logical. Maybe it was some old family friend, someone I just didn’t remember. Maybe Mom was embarrassed, or there had been a falling-out. That would explain the secrecy, the tone in her voice.

But it didn’t explain the lack of aging.

I decided to test it.

I pulled one of the Polaroids from its sleeve — my seventh birthday. I took a magnifying glass from the drawer and studied the man in the background. The resolution was grainy, colors faded, but his expression was clear. Neutral. Almost pleasant. His eyes, though—his eyes seemed too sharp for the cheap film.

I compared it to the photo from my high school graduation. Same eyes. Same expression. The only thing that changed was how much closer he was.

At the birthday, he was near the back wall of the PlayPlace.

At graduation, he was right there in the middle of the crowd.

Closer.

That word stuck in my head all night.

When I called my dad about it, hoping he’d laugh and give me some old forgotten story, he got quiet instead. Then he asked me to stop asking questions. His exact words were:

“Don’t dig into it. Let it go. For your own good.”

That’s when I knew it wasn’t a coincidence.

And that’s when I decided I had to know.

So I scanned the photos. Every single one that had him in it. Then I uploaded them to a facial recognition site, one of those free trial tools. I sat there, chewing my nails, watching the little spinning wheel as the site combed through public databases.

When the results came back, it wasn’t a name.

It wasn’t anything at all.

Just an error message.
FACE NOT RECOGNIZED. NO MATCHES FOUND.

I tried again with another site. Same result.
And another. Same thing.

It was like he didn’t exist.

But he does.

Because when I closed my laptop, my reflection in the dark screen wasn’t alone.

For half a second, just over my shoulder, I swear I saw him standing there.

After that incident, I couldn’t sleep. Every creak of the house felt amplified, every shadow stretched too long. I ended up dragging the photo album upstairs to my old bedroom, setting it on the desk like it was some kind of evidence file.

I told myself I was going to prove he wasn’t what I thought. That there had to be some explanation.

But the photos didn’t stay the same.

The first time I noticed, it was subtle. A snapshot from our trip to Niagara Falls—my dad holding me on his shoulders, water spraying in the background. I remembered that photo clearly because Dad had a goofy plastic poncho on. But now… the man was standing behind us. He wasn’t in the original. I know he wasn’t. He was closer than he’d ever been before, his face angled just enough that both of his eyes were visible.

And this time, he was smiling.

Not a friendly smile. More like someone holding back a secret.

I flipped to another photo. My eighth-grade science fair. The man had been in the back row before, blurry between parents. Now, his head tilted just slightly toward me, his mouth open like he’d just spoken.

I felt sick. My palms started sweating, pages sticking as I turned faster and faster.

Every picture had shifted. Not in obvious ways—nothing dramatic, nothing that would scream altered. Just little things. A glance. A lean. The man’s body turned ever so slightly toward me.

Like he was aware I was looking at him.

I shut the book and shoved it under my bed. But that didn’t help, because the images were burned into my brain. I kept thinking about his eyes—sharp, too sharp, the way they seemed to cut through the blur of cheap cameras.

That night, I dreamed I was flipping through the album again. But instead of birthdays or vacations, every page was a photo of me, right there in my room, taken from just outside the window. In every one, the man was closer, closer, closer, until the last photo was nothing but his face.

I woke up gasping, heart thudding like it wanted out of my chest.

The album was back on my desk.

I know I shoved it under the bed. I remember the scrape of cardboard against carpet. But there it was, sitting upright, open to the graduation photo.

And this time, the man wasn’t in the crowd.

He was standing on stage, next to me.

After that, I stopped pretending this was nostalgia. Something was wrong. Deeply, horribly wrong.

I didn’t tell my mom. I didn’t tell anyone. What could I even say? “Hey, remember that stranger in every childhood memory we have? Well, he’s moving closer now.” Yeah, that’d go over well.

Instead, I tried to ignore it. I shoved the album into the closet and stacked board games on top of it. Out of sight, out of mind.

Except it wasn’t.

The man started showing up outside the photos.

It began with the bathroom mirror. I’d just finished brushing my teeth when I saw him standing at the very edge of the reflection, where the doorway met the hall. I spun around so fast I nearly dropped the toothbrush. Nobody was there. The hallway was empty.

When I looked back, so was the mirror.

The next time, it was worse. I was in the kitchen, late at night, drinking water. The window above the sink looked out into the backyard. Dark, empty, nothing but trees. Except… not empty.

A figure was standing at the tree line. Perfectly still.

I didn’t need the details to know it was him. The posture was the same. Straight-backed. Hands folded. Waiting.

I backed away, heart hammering, telling myself it was just a trick of the dark, some shadow. But when I blinked, his head tilted—slow, deliberate—like he knew I was watching.

I yanked the curtains shut and didn’t open them again.

From then on, reflections betrayed me. Every dark screen, every pane of glass. I’d see him behind me, just far enough that I couldn’t make out all the details. But I felt him. The weight of his gaze pressed down like a hand on my shoulder.

I started covering mirrors. I unplugged the TV. I left the laptop lid closed. Still, I couldn’t escape him.

Because he wasn’t just showing up in the house anymore. He was interacting with the album.

One night, I heard rustling from the closet. Soft, like pages turning. I froze in bed, every muscle locking. The sound went on for a minute, then stopped. When I finally forced myself to look, the closet door was cracked open.

The board games I’d stacked on top of the album were scattered across the floor.

And the album itself was lying open, pages fluttering as if from a breeze.

I crept closer, every instinct screaming to stop, and I saw what page it had landed on.

Not a childhood memory. Not a holiday.

It was a photo I’d never seen before.

Me. Sitting in my bed. Now.

And in the bottom corner of the frame, half in shadow, the man was standing inside my room.

I couldn’t take it anymore. The album, the photos changing, the man pressing into my house—none of it made sense. There had to be an explanation. Some missing piece.

So I confronted my mom.

She was in the living room, folding laundry, when I dropped the album on the coffee table. The thud made her flinch. She looked at it like I’d just set down a dead animal.

“Tell me who he is,” I demanded. My voice shook, but I didn’t care. “The man. He’s in every picture. And don’t tell me it’s coincidence, because he’s in ones that didn’t even exist before.”

Her hands tightened on a towel until her knuckles went white. She didn’t answer.

“Mom,” I pressed. “Please. Just tell me the truth.”

Finally, she set the towel down and sank onto the couch. For the first time in my life, she looked… old. Tired. Like she’d been holding something in for decades and it had finally rotted her from the inside.

“I hoped you wouldn’t notice,” she whispered. “We all hoped.”

My skin went cold. “We?”

She nodded slowly. “Your grandmother, your uncle, your father, and me. We… we never talk about him. That’s the rule. You don’t say his name, you don’t point him out, you don’t acknowledge him. Because if you do, he notices you back.”

Her eyes glistened. She looked at me the way someone looks at a terminal patient—grief already there.

“Why is he in our pictures?” I asked.

Mom shook her head. “He’s always been in our family. Always. As far back as the albums go. Every generation, he’s there. Weddings, funerals, baptisms. Sometimes he’s just a blur. Sometimes he’s… closer.”

She covered her mouth, like she regretted saying that much.

I leaned forward. “What does he want?”

Her hand dropped into her lap. She didn’t answer.

“Mom.” My voice cracked. “What does he want?”

She whispered it so faintly I almost didn’t hear:
“He chooses.”

I felt sick. “Chooses what?”

Her eyes darted to the album. “Who stays. Who doesn’t.”

My stomach turned. Suddenly, pieces clicked together that I’d never questioned before. My cousin Danny, who disappeared when I was ten. The way relatives never talked about him. The empty chair at holidays nobody mentioned.

I remembered once, when I was little, asking about him. My grandma had snapped, “We don’t talk about Danny.” I’d thought it was grief. But now… now I wondered if it was fear.

Because when I flipped to the family reunion photo—the one where we’d all gathered at the park—I noticed something I hadn’t before.

Danny was in that photo. Smiling, holding a frisbee.

But in the copy I held now, he wasn’t.

The man was standing in his place.

I couldn’t breathe.

Danny wasn’t in the photo anymore. Just gone, erased like he’d never existed. And the man—standing where he’d been—looked sharper than ever, clearer than anyone else in the picture.

I slammed the album shut and backed away. “Mom, we can’t just ignore this. He’s here. He’s here.”

She wouldn’t look at me. “The more you fight, the faster it happens. You’ve already seen too much.”

“What happens?”

Her eyes filled with tears. She shook her head. “I’m so sorry, sweetheart.”

That’s when I heard it.

A Click.

The unmistakable sound of a camera shutter, faint, coming from somewhere inside the house.

I froze. “Did you hear that?”

Mom’s face crumpled. “He’s already chosen.”

I spun toward the sound. The hallway was empty, shadows stretching long. My pulse roared in my ears as I crept toward my bedroom.

The album was waiting for me on the desk. Open. Pages fluttering though there was no breeze.

Another click.

I looked down.

There, on the fresh page, was a new Polaroid. Still developing, the chemical haze fading into an image: me. Standing in the hallway. Right now.

Behind me, in the photo, the man was closer than ever. Not blurred, not distant. His hand was outstretched, almost touching my shoulder.

Click.

Another Polaroid slid onto the page by itself. This one showed me staring at the photo I was holding. My own face pale, horrified. And behind me—no longer reaching—he was gripping my shoulder.

I dropped the book and stumbled back, heart slamming against my ribs.

The lights flickered.

And then the mirror across the room began to ripple.

Not like glass breaking—like water. Like something was pressing through.

A hand emerged first. Pale. Thin. Fingers too long. They pressed against the glass, then curled around the frame.

I couldn’t move. My legs locked as his face pushed forward, stretching the surface until it tore open with a sound like wet fabric ripping.

He stepped through.

He was exactly as he appeared in every photo—dark jacket, neat hair, expression calm. Only now he was inches away.

“Why?” I choked out. My voice sounded tiny, useless.

He tilted his head, studying me with those sharp, unblinking eyes. And then—slowly, deliberately—he raised the old camera hanging from his neck.

Click.

The flash blinded me.

For a second, I saw nothing. Just white.

When my vision cleared, I wasn’t in my room anymore.

I was in the photo album.

I could see my mom, standing over the book, crying. I could see my own face, frozen mid-scream, trapped behind the glossy surface.

And behind me, already stepping into the frame, was the man.

Closer.

As you travel on this peak mountain, I traveled myself in car.

I don't usually like to go to mountains, because of the satisfaction it gives me.

Yet, I went that day, played some good music.

The song felt like a sweet release, you get.

Slow by slow, you see the sudden fog, covering the car doors.

As I turned on the wipers, then it became even more fudge.

So I stopped my car.

And got out.

The fog covered, me.

As I forgot to turn on the car blinkers.

I went back, and then I saw a strange man, walking with a cane.

He just looked intoxicated, so as he passed me by, he told.

Turn off the blinkers, this is not the road for blinkers.

As they will blind you, so I thought, why is he so bothered abiut the blinkers.

As i went through, trying to make sense of off it.

I sat near the slab, of the mountain road, trying to make sense of it.

I then drank some of my coffee, which I usually  keep in the backpack.

I kept repeating his words, and then it hit me.

It is not the blinkers.

It is something else, altogether.

Physical Changes

My energy has been through the roof since Day 1. I feel like I don’t even need coffee most mornings anymore. I’m sleeping better than ever. I’m falling asleep fast and staying asleep, and I’m waking up ready to move.

Clothes-wise, things are weird right now. My jeans are still the same size I wore 50 pounds ago, but most of my tops and dresses are way too big. It’s a good problem to have, I guess!
Biggest non-scale victory: I can run again. 

When I started in June, I could only jog for one minute at a time. Now I can run four miles without stopping at a 10:30 pace, and I even ran a 5K race in late September! I feel so proud after every run, and man, that runner’s high is REAL! It’s like reconnecting with a part of me I lost for years and didn't know I desperately needed back!!

And one more huge one: my A1C dropped from 6.5 to 4.8 in just three months! That’s after years of steroid-related blood sugar issues due to inflammatory autoimmune health stuff. Absolutely life-changing.

Mental and Emotional Changes

This part is hard to put into words, but my mind feels so clear! I don’t know if I’ve ever felt this focused or capable. I can stick with tasks longer, organize better, and I just feel... steady.

Confidence-wise, I’ve always been comfortable with myself, but lately I find myself reaching for shorts and tank tops without thinking twice, which feels totally amazing.

Even my anxiety seems better. I’m still on my SSRI, but for the first time in five years, I’m considering talking to my doctor about lowering the dose. I’m juggling more responsibilities than ever, but I’m handling stress so much better than before.

My mantra through all of this has been:

“The time will pass anyway.” 

You can put in the work now, or not… but the time’s going to pass either way. Progress never comes from comfort zones, and I’m so glad I chose to keep pushing.

If you’re just starting Zepbound and not sure it’ll work for you: trust the process. Everyone’s body is different, doses vary, and it might take some trial and error. But this medication is giving so many of us our lives back, and that’s something to celebrate! 

Thanks for letting me share today. This community has been such a source of motivation for me, so I hope my post can reach some of you as well. I’m beyond grateful to feel strong, clear-headed, and like myself again. Thanks, Zep!

I’ve been following this Reddit thread for USJ guides for a while, and I thought you’d appreciate if I did the same — to share some of my insights and experiences.
Heads up: this will be a bit of a long post! I’ll go over how my day went, include some tips and tricks along the way, and end with wins/losses, attraction ratings, and a TL;DR.

Morning

I woke up at 6, got ready, and took the metro to Universal Studios Japan (the train station is literally called that). I arrived at 7:05, grabbed a coffee, breakfast, and water at a konbini, and headed to the park.

After finishing breakfast, I went through the baggage check — note that only a 500 ml water bottle or smaller is allowed (no food or other drinks).

I got in line around 7:30. The gates were still closed, but they started letting people in about 10–15 minutes later, and I entered around 8:00. The line was already long but moved quickly.

I bought my tickets online (I don’t think you can get them anywhere else). I didn’t have an Express Pass, but I had an area time-limited ticket for Super Nintendo World at 14:30.

---

Harry Potter World

Since I already had my Nintendo World slot, I started at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter.
And oh my god — it’s gorgeous. It feels like stepping straight into a movie.

Flight of the Hippogriff: waited ~15 minutes. Fun but super short. Nice views, not scary.
Rating: 6/10

Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey: waited ~20 minutes. The queue interior is stunning, and the ride itself was amazing — long, thrilling, and full of surprises.
Unfortunately, I got hit with terrible motion sickness afterward and felt awful for about an hour.
Rating: Ride – 10/10 | Aftermath – 1/10

---

Jurassic Park

Next, I headed to the Jurassic area. I thought I was queueing for The Flying Dinosaur, but it turned out to be Jurassic Park: The Ride — probably for the best since I was still feeling rough. Waited around 20–25 minutes.

It’s a really fun water ride with some great scares and a big drop at the end.
Rating: 7/10

After finishing here, I honestly had no plan for what to do next. I decided to just wander around and see what caught my eye, figuring I’d check out the shops or another nearby attraction. That’s how I stumbled upon WaterWorld — and wow, what a surprise that turned out to be.

---

WaterWorld

At this point, I noticed WaterWorld nearby and walked in around 10:20 for the 11:00 show — not realizing it was a show, not a ride. I ended up being one of the first in line.

Before it started, one of the actors came out to hype us up — and I got absolutely drenched in the “splash zone.” I had to hand my bag to a kind Japanese granny in a dry seat.

The show itself was incredible — thrilling, funny, and full of surprises. I won’t spoil anything, but this was easily my favorite thing in the park.
Rating: 11/10 — absolutely worth it, especially in today’s 28°C heat!

---

Lunch

After the show, I was starving, so I went back to Harry Potter World and queued about 20 minutes for lunch. You order and pay via QR code.

I got the rotisserie smoked chicken and shepherd’s pie meal (plus a corn cob, veggies, a Butterbeer, and an unsweetened iced tea).

Food review:

Shepherd’s pie – tasty.

Corn & veggies – standard.

Chicken – severely overcooked and super dry. Not great, but hey, protein.
Meal rating: 5/10


Butterbeer: Holy hell, this was amazing. Sweet, fizzy, creamy — and super refreshing.
Drink rating: 10/10

---

JAWS & Zombie Tour

By noon, the park was packed. I went to the JAWS ride — the regular line was 40 mins, but the single rider line was practically empty, so I walked straight on.

The ride was fine, though I didn’t understand the Japanese dialogue.
Rating: 5/10

Next, I stopped by the Factory of Fear: Zombie Tour with a 20-minute wait. The warning video before entering was intense. Inside, it was well made — creepy and fun.

What made it even better was the young Japanese couple behind me who were terrified and clinging to my backpack the whole time. I was crying laughing.
Rating: 8/10

At this point, fatigue started to kick in.

---

Super Nintendo World

I entered Super Nintendo World around 14:30.
Dude… it was insanely crowded. Every line had a 2+ hour wait, and there were no crepes inside (they’re actually sold at the Mario Café near the entrance).

I took some photos and left — it was way too hot and packed.
Rating: 4/10

Tip: Don’t bother with the area time-limited ticket. Instead, arrive early and run straight to Nintendo World when the park opens. Do it first thing, then hit the other popular rides later with an Express Pass (which I regret not buying).

---

Mario Café

Completely drained, I stopped by the Mario Café and got the Mario’s Cap Strawberry Shortcake Crepe and Luigi’s Green Apple Soda (cream soda with ice cream and boba).

Both were fantastic — light, refreshing, and worth it.

---

Hollywood Dream

I still wanted some thrills, so I lined up for Hollywood Dream: The Ride around 15:20 using the single rider line (posted wait time: 100 minutes). I hoped it’d be shorter — it wasn’t.

I waited about 1.5 hours but finally rode at 17:05. The ride was smooth, fast, and super fun — and best of all, no motion sickness.
Rating: 10/10

At this point, I was completely done — feet killing me, energy gone, and wait times were all 1.5–2 hours. Definitely not worth it anymore.

---

End of Day

Right outside the park are some great American restaurants like Red Lobster and Shake Shack. As a European, I was hyped — I went to Shake Shack, tried the burger, and it was fantastic.
Rating: 10/10

And that wraps up my day at USJ! I really wish I had bought at least a 4-ride Express Pass — it would’ve made the whole experience smoother.

---

WINS

WaterWorld show (phenomenal)

Butterbeer (so good)

Mario crepe & Luigi soda

Hollywood Dream: The Ride (favorite ride)

Watch the WaterWorld show — it’s the best thing in the park.
Bring sunscreen and a hat.
Try Butterbeer and Mario Café treats.
Do the thrill rides even if you’re nervous.
Beware motion sickness on Forbidden Journey.
And most importantly, have fun!

I’d spend hours scrolling “unique gifts for men/women/everyone” lists that all felt the same. Nothing ever felt right. Then someone sent me this free guide called *The Gift Whisperer* (not mine, not selling anything), and it quietly rewired how I think about giving.

The main idea? Good gifts don’t come from knowing someone’s hobbies.. they come from noticing their routines. The little frictions, the quiet habits, the random things they mention in passing. Once I started paying attention there, giftgiving got way more creative and way less stressful.

Now I keep a running note on my phone of “micro cluesss” people drop during the year..  stuff like “always losing earbuds” or “complains their coffee gets cold.” It’s wild how much easier it becomes when you listen differently.

Every morning he clocked in, whether it be from a motel, a hotel, or an apartment. Wherever he could rest at. He logged in to theMercer Financial Institutions network. As **Frank Taylor**, as usual.
He was good at his job, dependable even. Nobody suspected him. His veil was perfect.

For a while that is.

---

It started with an audit.

Mercer had been asked to host a short-term cross-organization review. An outside executive, Harlan, was coming in to examine how donations moved between the company and a partner charity. The review was only supposed to last a week. They needed someone from inside to assist with paperwork while the auditors ran live reconciliations. Frank’s supervisor tapped him without asking.

It was the kind of opportunity that offered a lot of access and very little oversight. The auditors watched totals and signatures, not the interim steps in the software queue.

---

He noticed the delay in the system: transfers showed as “pending” for two to three days before they cleared. It was a normal part of the pipeline, an automated hold intended for batch verification. That small delay was enough.

He created a pair of temporary “holding accounts” in the ledger — labeled as affiliated partners, documented in a way that matched the company’s naming conventions. When donations came in during the audit, a portion was routed to the holding account; the records showed a later forwarding to the proper recipient. In practice, the money paused there for a day, then moved on. The detour was invisible to anyone running the high-level reconciliation.

He ran a few small transfers through the holding accounts. Amounts that looked like administrative fees or micro-grants, nothing that would prompt an immediate red flag. The records aligned on audit queries, the totals matched. He even annotated the entries with plausible memos about processing delays and partner confirmations.

At the closing meeting, Harlan praised the accounting team for their thoroughness. “You resolved the timing issue cleanly,” he said, shaking hands. A man congratulated Frank on catching an efficiency problem. It looked like competence. It looked official.

---

He knew it couldn’t last. Systems like that corrected themselves eventually. Someone in compliance would ask for raw export logs. Someone in legal would want vendor paper trails. The smarter the detour, the narrower the window before it appeared in a different light.

Three days later an internal email hit his inbox.

> Subject: Internal Audit — Department Review
“As part of our compliance program, the finance division will undergo a transaction audit beginning next week. Please cooperate fully with the review team.”



He read it twice. The words were precise. No names were being thrown around just yet but he new it would come to him eventually

He thought about deleting his edits, about reversing transfers, about fabricating confirmations. He knew how to bury a trace, but he also knew how those traces came back around when systems were probed from another angle.

That night he went to a diner on the edge of the district, the kind that stayed open because someone always needed coffee. Two Mercer employees sat in a booth behind him, joking quietly.

“…heard the finance team’s under review,” one said. “Compliance is pulling export logs. They said it could be internal.”

The other laughed. “it's one of those remote workers again probably. When is our company gonna learn not to hire these people. Atleast make them come in once a week""

He couldn't enjoy his meal after that. He left in a hurry soon after, barely touched his meal.

Back at his place he opened his laptop and typed up an email to HR.

> “Effective immediately, I’m resigning from my position at Mercer.
— Frank Taylor.”

That looks suspicious, he thought. Resigning immediately after they said they'll audit? Surely someone's gonna be on his tail.
It didn't matter anymore, he packed whatever he had and left before sunrise

By the time they started pulling up the data he was long gone. Apartment empty and account inactive, no phone calls could reach him.

For years, I thought I had zero self-control. Every night I'd promise myself ""last time,"" and every morning I'd wake up feeling like shit—drained, ashamed, foggy. I'd make it 3-4 days, then relapse harder. The cycle felt permanent.

Then I learned something that changed everything: I wasn't weak. My brain had been rewired by supernormal stimuli that evolution never prepared us for. Modern porn delivers dopamine spikes 200-400% higher than actual sex. Your brain can't tell the difference between pixels and reality—it just knows it's getting flooded with reward chemicals.

**Here's what actually worked:**

**The 72-Hour Hell Zone:** Days 1-3 are pure neurochemical withdrawal. Your brain is screaming for its dopamine fix. I had to physically leave my apartment during high-risk times—coffee shops, gym, libraries, anywhere public. The urges peaked around day 2, then started dropping. Just knowing this helped me push through.

**Replace, Don't Erase:** You can't just delete a habit. When urges hit, I'd immediately do 50 pushups or take a freezing shower. The physical shock reset my nervous system. Sounds extreme, but desperation works.

**Nuke Your Triggers:** Website blockers, phone out of bedroom, deleted Instagram (those ""suggested"" posts aren't innocent). I treated my environment like substance abuse recovery—because neurologically, that's what this is.

**The Game-Changer: Accountability That Actually Works:** This is where I'd always failed before. I'd try to white-knuckle it alone, then relapse in secret. What finally worked was having real-time accountability. I found this app that tracks your progress and sends you reminders during your high-risk hours. It's not some AI bullshit—it's designed specifically for breaking addictive patterns. Watching my streak grow became its own dopamine reward, and during those brutal first weeks, having something ping me right when I was about to relapse literally saved me multiple times. I also joined [r/pornfree](/r/pornfree/) and [r/nofap](/r/nofap/) for community support.For additional help [https://toronto.soberlivingnetwork.org/](https://toronto.soberlivingnetwork.org/) , [https://linktr.ee/soberlivingnetwork](https://linktr.ee/soberlivingnetwork) one can join these

**The Chaser Effect:** This one saved me. After a relapse, I'd binge for days thinking ""already failed, fuck it."" Learning this pattern had a name helped me stop the spiral. One slip doesn't erase weeks of healing. Your brain is literally rewiring during clean days.

**The withdrawal was brutal.** Brain fog, irritability, couldn't sleep, felt depressed for two weeks. But around day 21, something shifted. Energy came back. Anxiety dropped. I could look people in the eye. By day 90, I felt like a different person—sharper, more confident, actually present in conversations.

**Real talk:** This addiction doesn't just steal your time. It steals your energy, your focus, your ability to connect with actual humans. Every hour in that cycle is an hour you're not building the life you want.

The shame keeps you trapped. The secrecy keeps you sick. The belief that ""this is just who I am"" keeps you stuck.

But you're not stuck. Neuroplasticity is real. The same pathways that got hijacked can be rewired. Usually takes 90 days minimum for significant changes, sometimes 6-12 months for full reboot, but it's absolutely possible.

I'm not gonna bullshit you—it's hard. I still get urges sometimes. But now I have tools, not just willpower. I understand my triggers. I've built a life where I don't need the escape anymore.

If you're reading this and feeling that pit in your stomach because you relate too hard—start today. Not Monday. Not next week. Right fucking now.

The person you're supposed to be is on the other side of this.

I spent way too much time experimenting with Google's Nano Banana and found the exact prompts that actually work for creating meme templates. These aren't random, but they're based on the most shared formats across Reddit, Twitter, and TikTok.

As someone who makes content for multiple platforms, I was tired of using the same overused meme templates everyone else uses. Started testing AI image transformation specifically for meme creation and these 10 prompts consistently produce the best results.

---

**1. Classic Drake Choice Format**

> ""First ask me for a selfie or upload a model image. Transform my image into a Drake pointing meme template with two panels - one showing me rejecting something with a dismissive hand gesture and expression, and another showing me pointing approvingly with a big smile. Use clean background separation and bold lighting for maximum meme impact.""

**2. Distracted Boyfriend Energy**

> ""First ask me for a selfie or upload a model image. Transform my image into the classic distracted boyfriend meme format with three people - me as the boyfriend looking back with interest, a girlfriend looking annoyed in the foreground, and an attractive alternative in the background. Use urban street setting with dynamic composition.""

**3. Shocked Pikachu Reaction**

> ""First ask me for a selfie or upload a model image. Transform my image into a shocked Pikachu-style reaction meme with my mouth wide open, eyes bulging, and an expression of complete surprise and disbelief. Use bright, cartoon-like lighting and a simple background that emphasizes the dramatic facial expression.""

**4. This Is Fine Chaos**

> ""First ask me for a selfie or upload a model image. Transform my image into the 'This is Fine' meme template with me sitting calmly with a slight smile while surrounded by chaos or fire effects in the background. The contrast between my calm expression and the chaotic background should be stark and humorous.""

**5. Monday Morning Reality**

> ""First ask me for a selfie or upload a model image. Transform my image into a Monday morning mood meme showing me looking absolutely exhausted and defeated while holding a coffee cup. The lighting should be harsh fluorescent office lighting that emphasizes the struggle of starting a new work week.""

**6. Confused Math Lady Vibes**

> ""First ask me for a selfie or upload a model image. Transform my image into a confused math lady meme template with me looking puzzled and overwhelmed, with floating mathematical equations and formulas around my head. Use soft lighting with the math elements glowing subtly in the background.""

**7. Diet Starts Monday Energy**

> ""First ask me for a selfie or upload a model image. Transform my image into a diet procrastination meme with me enjoying food with guilty pleasure while mentally justifying the delay. Use warm, tempting food lighting that captures the internal negotiation of wellness goals versus immediate satisfaction.""

**8. Netflix Binge Commitment**

> ""First ask me for a selfie or upload a model image. Transform my image into a streaming addiction meme showing me with bloodshot eyes and snacks, completely absorbed in binge-watching content. Use TV screen glow lighting that captures the modern entertainment consumption lifestyle.""

**9. Procrastination Justification Expert**

> ""First ask me for a selfie or upload a model image. Transform my image into a procrastination rationalization meme with me looking confident while clearly avoiding responsibilities. Use natural lighting that captures the art of self-deception and deadline negotiation with yourself.""

**10 Social Battery Completely Drained**

> ""First ask me for a selfie or upload a model image. Transform my image into an introvert exhaustion meme showing me looking completely depleted after social interaction. Use soft lighting that emphasizes the need for solitude and social energy recovery time.""

---

## What I Learned From Testing These

**The key is specificity.** Vague prompts like ""make me look funny"" don't work. You need to describe exact expressions, lighting, and composition.

**Lighting matters more than you think.** The difference between ""natural lighting"" and ""harsh fluorescent lighting"" completely changes the meme's impact.

**Leave space for text.** These prompts are designed with text overlay in mind - that's what makes them actual meme templates vs just funny photos.

**Start with popular formats.** Don't try to invent new meme formats. Use what people already recognize and relate to.

**Pro Tips That Actually Help**

- Use high-res source photos for better results
- Test the same prompt with different facial expressions in your source image
- The ""First ask me for a selfie or upload a model image"" part is crucial - don't skip it
- Save successful outputs as templates for quick meme creation later

Which format do you use most? I'm curious what meme templates people actually find themselves reaching for. The Monday morning one hits way too close to home for me.

We dated for a year and then she broke up with me in august 2024, and it happened after I got a year back in college, so I decided to travel for the year as I didn’t wanted to live in the city, so now that I am back to college, we started talking again, and I always try to be there for her whenever she asks me to, because I honestly don’t care about what relations is there between her and me, I always cared for her and I will, and she too cares for me from what I have felt, so at first we both were kind of awkward with each other but then as we kept on meeting the awkwardness went away, and then last week she called me while she was drunk and I went to see her, at first she tried to kiss me but I said no as I knew she drunk and it would come back on me only, then she got mad at me and told me that she’s over me and, doesn’t even like me anymore and, that I should stop being nice and considerate to her, I said, I can’t do it, and that I don’t care about what happened between us, you still matter to me, then she told me when last year I wasn’t here, she tried to date some other guy and it didn’t worked out between them, she told me about him in a way that would provoke me and that she did it to move on but ended up realising that she can’t, then I consoled her and we both talked for some time and then I went back home, I did had tears in my eyes when I got back but I think that’s something that I should with, and I don’t want her to know it, so then we met again after that night, we went out for coffee, while returning back she held me and made out with me, now I don’t know what to say I too was a equal part of it, I dropped her off and went home she called me and told me that she didn’t regret what had happened and she wanted to do it, and then she told me about her conditions, like what she wants, and I agreed to them all, and through out the night we flirted she even sent me her nudes even tho I didn’t asked for it, after that day we had exams, so for 3 days we both barely talked, I didn’t bothered her much as I knew exams are going and I don’t want to do anything to distract her, but last night I went to see her, to talk about everything that’s been going on, and she told me that I misinterpreted things, what happened wasn’t meaningless, but at the same time she can’t date me, as I am a nice guy overall, but at the same time my life is not at all stable and she wants a stable future, which she do not see with me. I told her that I can make changes in myself if that’s what you want, but she said no, She can’t date me, then she said that I might have everything but I don’t have what she wants, in the end I told her that I still have feelings for her, and for me it’s gonna be the same in the future too, now it’s on you how you interpret it, I have made myself clear.

Aye, you read that right. A 46-year-old Scot, successfully transplanted to the wilds of Pennsylvania. I've traded the lochs and glens for rolling hills and the occasional Wawa run, and I have to say, it's not half bad.

About me:

The accent is 100% authentic. It’s particularly effective for ordering coffee and confusing telemarketers.

I enjoy a good single malt whisky, but I'm quickly developing an appreciation for Pennsylvania's local breweries.

My passions lie somewhere between getting out for a good hike on a crisp autumn day and getting cozy on the sofa with a great film (anything from a tense thriller to a stupidly funny comedy).

I have my life together—stable career, own place, can cook a few decent meals that don't involve haggis (unless you're into that).

My sense of humor is a bit dry, a bit sarcastic, and essential for navigating life. I believe laughing, especially at yourself, is a vital life skill.

Who I'm looking for:

A woman (let's say 35-55ish) who is kind, intelligent, and doesn't take herself too seriously. Someone who can hold a conversation that goes beyond small talk, who is passionate about something, and who believes a good partner is a teammate. A shared sense of humor is a massive plus.

If any of this piques your interest, send me a message. To break the ice, tell me: what's one thing I absolutely have to see or do in Pennsylvania?",1,1759930400.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

1o1ahci,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlchemyBeauty/comments/1o1ahci/investigate_the_best_laundry_detergent_pacs_tide/,Investigate the Best Laundry Detergent Pacs Tide Really Delivers,"Tide 80735047 has been a game-changer for my laundry routine. From the moment I started using these laundry detergent pods, I noticed a drastic difference in how clean and fresh my clothes felt. The built-in stain removers, odor fighters, and color protectors in this 3-in-1 solution make laundry ridiculously easy, particularly for someone like me who often juggles a busy schedule. Just toss one of these pre-measured pods into the drum, and you're good to go. No more measuring liquid detergent or dealing with messy spills. The minimal effort required is a breath of fresh air.

**Ease of Use and Compact Design**  
The Tide PODS are fantastically convenient. Each pod is compact, fuss-free, and pre-measured, which eliminates the guesswork. Whether it’s a regular load of weekly laundry or a monstrous pile post-camping trip, these pods simplify the process. Their small, easy-to-handle packaging doesn’t take up much storage space, making it a fit in even cramped laundry rooms or cabinets. As someone living in an apartment with limited storage, I genuinely appreciated not needing to cram a giant bottle of detergent into my already packed laundry shelf.  

[Ready to buy Tide 80735047? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://stylistexperts.com/p/b0bjmnhlxz/)

**Merits**  
- Combines detergent, stain remover, and color protector in one.  
- Dissolves entirely in cold water, avoiding partially dissolved residues.  
- Effectively removes stubborn stains like grease or wine effortlessly.  
  

**Performance and Cleaning Quality**  
The cleaning power is nothing short of impressive. These pods tackle everything from wine spills to dirt from outdoor adventures. One memorable moment was when my friend spilled coffee on her white blouse during a brunch. Tossed it in with a Tide POD, and voilà—the stain was gone in just one wash. It gives me peace of mind knowing it works on 100% of common stains without additional treatments required. Even bulky items like bedding come out refreshed, which speaks volumes about their efficiency.  

**Winning Points**  
- Long-lasting freshness with the Spring Meadow scent.  
- Truly strong performance even for heavily soiled or large laundry loads.  
  
**Scent and Sensitivity**  
The Spring Meadow scent is honestly delightful. It’s not overpowering, making it suitable even for folks who typically dislike overly fragrant detergents. Thankfully, I’ve had zero skin irritations despite my sensitive skin reacting to other detergents in the past. For a product tackling such robust cleaning jobs, the hypoallergenic nature of these pods is a major plus.

**Hurdles**  
- Not ideal for those who prefer unscented detergents.  
- Pods are somewhat pricier compared to standard liquid detergent options.  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to similar products like Persil ProClean Discs or Gain Flings, Tide Pods excel in both stain removal and odor-fighting. While I’ve tried other options, Tide’s formula stands out for its balance of quality cleaning and fresh scent. Gain Flings, while great for fragrance variety, didn’t match up in terms of tackling deeply set stains. Price-wise, both Persil and Tide are close, but the latter’s environmental promise (concentrated with three times the cleaning ingredients) adds another edge.  

**Money's Worth**  
This product sits at a slightly higher price point, but considering its powerful formula and the time saved by its three-in-one efficiency, it’s undeniably a worthwhile investment. For someone who wants effective cleaning without compromising on freshness or convenience, this product is spot-on. Buying it in bulk also helps cut down on the cost per pod, which is something I’d recommend exploring.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I have successfully fought off the upgrade demons for a while, but my will is fading and I’m feeling the seductive whispers of possibility encouraging me to get some new toys to tinker with. So. Here I am.

The Sette has been a stoic, if noisy and rambunctious partner and whilst I like the fluffy grind, it has become coarser over time and the adjustment process is somewhat annoying (I know I could shim, but shim I have not). I grind mostly beans I can buy locally - at the moment the medium roast Superlost Supernova which I’ve really taken to.

The Rancilio works marvelously on the whole, but pumping through a couple of coffees in the morning - or even more if I have guests - is an exercise is mild frustration and dodgy temperature control and lots of flushing of the grouphead and boiler.

On the budget front, I don’t want to sweat the purchase too much, ergo I want to stop short of paying for marginal gains I am unlikely to notice.

So in terms of goals I’d like to address the annoyances without introducing worse ones, and have some new ways to experiment with pulling better shots.

So far my thinking is a GBW grinder like the Eurkea Mignon Libra because that simple workflow appeals, and the Lelit Bianca, because despite its age, the E61 design is beautiful and functional. And it has dual boilers and plenty of other useful looking features. Why do metal pipes and wood look so class together?

And so - questions - is that a good combo? Should I bump up on the grinder and drop down a level on the espresso machine? Should I hold on to one or the other and spend more cash on a single upgrade instead?

1o1aer5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TuliniiOfficial/comments/1o1aer5/why_cotton_bandanas_are_making_a_huge_comeback/,Why Cotton Bandanas Are Making a Huge Comeback This Year,"Some accessories never really go out of style; they just change with the times.  The cotton bandana is one of these classic favorites.  The bandana has become the most important style item for both men and women in 2025. You can wear it around your neck, as a hair accessory, or around your wrist. 

The cotton bandana used to be just a square of cloth, but now it stands for creativity, confidence, and being different.  It's everywhere now, from high-fashion runways to cozy coffee shops, from bikers to influencers, and from men's streetwear to women's minimalist fashion. 

So what's causing this growing obsession?  Let's find out why everyone, and I mean everyone, loves cotton bandanas again. 

1. The Comeback of Timeless Style 

Fashion always comes back around.  A useful item for farmers, workers, and cowboys in the 1800s has become a stylish, must-have accessory for today's wardrobe. 

The [cotton bandanas](https://www.tulinii.com/collections/bandana) are back in style in 2025.  It combines old-fashioned style with new, modern style.  The bandana is beautiful because it is so simple. Depending on how you wear it, it can look tough, classy, or effortlessly cool. 

Bandanas are for everyone, as shown by Harry Styles wearing one on stage and Hailey Bieber wearing hers with streetwear. 

2. The Appeal for Everyone 

The cotton bandana is different from most accessories because it can be worn by anyone. 

This one piece works for everyone, no matter if you're a man, woman, or non-binary. It fits every style, vibe, and personality. 

* Men love how tough and easygoing it is when tied around their head, wrist, or neck.  

* Women love how versatile it is as a style statement, going from a hair tie to a neck scarf in seconds.  

* Everyone loves how comfortable, easy to use, and endless styling options it has. 

Tulinii's Cotton Bandanas are a great example of the new era of gender-neutral style as the fashion world moves toward being more open and allowing people to express themselves. 

3. Comfort and Functionality Go Hand in Hand 

Cotton bandanas are useful for more than just fashion.  They are light, skin-friendly, and made of soft, breathable cotton. They are great for all-day wear, whether you're dressing up or on the go. 

* Do you need to keep your hair out of your face at the gym?  Bandana. 

* Want to keep the sun off your neck?  A bandana. 

* Need a quick way to keep dust off your stuff while you travel?  You guessed it: a bandana. 

* And the best part?  It fits in your pocket and can be used over and over again. 

People love Cotton Bandanas because they are well made.  Each piece is made of high-quality, hand-printed cotton that is soft, long-lasting, and strong enough to withstand many adventures and washes. 

4. The Green Accessory 

Sustainability is no longer just a buzzword; it's a way of thinking.  People today want things that look good and do good.  That's why the cotton bandana is a great fit for a mindful lifestyle. 

Cotton is a natural material that breaks down over time, and when it comes from a good source, it's one of the most eco-friendly fabrics out there. 

Tulinii goes even further by making small-batch, hand-made bandanas using old-fashioned printing methods that cut down on waste and help local artists. 

When you buy a Cotton Bandana for men and women, you're not just picking a style; you're also supporting fashion that is good for the environment. 

5. The Best Travel Partner 

If you like to travel light, you'll see how useful a cotton bandana can be.  It's small, useful, and very useful.  You can wear it, clean with it, tie it, or even use it as a quick pouch if you need to. 

All travelers, including backpackers, bikers, and digital nomads, agree that a bandana is a must-have.  Why bring more than one accessory when one cotton square can do it all? 

A Tulinii Cotton Bandana is a great way to add style and function to your trip, whether you're hiking in Colorado, driving through Arizona, or walking through downtown LA. 

6. A Canvas for Self-Expression 

Fashion is all about who you are, and bandanas are one of the easiest ways to show that.  Every color, print, or fold has a story to tell.  You might like old-fashioned paisley or bold, modern patterns. Either way, it's you. 

Tulinii makes handmade cotton bandanas in a variety of bright patterns that are inspired by nature, art, and craftsmanship from around the world. 

They're not just things to wear; they're ways to show who you are. 

7. Approved by Celebrities and Tested on the Street 

You know a trend is big when famous people and influencers start to like it.  But cotton bandanas weren't just ""in style""; they became a must-have item. 

Rihanna, Timothée Chalamet, Billie Eilish, and Gigi Hadid are all wearing them in their own special ways.  People who like streetwear wear them with hoodies and sneakers, while people who work in high fashion wear them with tailored blazers or summer dresses. 

That is what makes bandanas so timeless: their ability to be used in so many ways. 

8. Simple to Style: 10 Fun Ways to Tie a Tulinii Cotton Bandana

1o1acao,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousePowered/comments/1o1acao/find_out_if_the_best_propane_grill_by_outvita_is/,Find Out if the Best Propane Grill by Outvita Is Worth It,"Tested out the Outvita OV-BURNER-184 propane grill over the course of a few months with backyard barbecues, camping trips, and a birthday party extravaganza thrown in for good measure. This beast of a grill brought its A-game almost every time, but there are definitely a few quirks worth pointing out. Let's get into the nitty-gritty of it.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The moment I unboxed this propane grill, the robust cast iron construction caught my attention. The black powder-coated finish gave it a sleek look while also promising weather resistance, a must-have for outdoor cooking gear. While it weighs just over 37 pounds, it didn’t feel overly bulky, making it easier to lug around to different backyard spots or pack up for a campsite. The detachable legs are something I hadn’t thought I’d appreciate this much—quick to attach and detach, they made storage and portability a breeze. However, I did notice that the screws used to secure the legs seemed a tad lightweight, which left me second-guessing its long-term durability.

**Performance and Energy Output**  
With 225,000 BTUs spread across those three powerful burners, this wasn’t just a grill—it was an absolute flamethrower. It cranked out extreme heat in no time, perfect for everything from boiling a massive pot of crawfish to searing steaks like a pro. Each burner comes with its own temperature control knob, and I loved the flexibility it gave me to multitask. Cooking pancake breakfasts while frying bacon and boiling coffee? All made more manageable. Having said that, regulating the flame for uniform cooking required a bit of a learning curve, particularly during windy outdoor conditions where you'd notice occasional flickering.

**Great Features for Outdoor Use**  
This propane stove truly shines in an outdoor kitchen setting. Its adult-friendly height makes it comfortable for hours of cooking, whether you’re grilling burgers for a summer get-together or brewing chili on a chilly camping night. What really makes it stand out is its adaptability to different scenarios—I used it for brewing beer once, and it handled the large pot with ease. However, given how powerful this thing is, make sure you have a good, stable propane supply and keep it on a level surface. It’s built like a tank, but safety first.

[Check Outvita OV-BURNER-184 price on Amazon.](https://chvnx.com/p/b0b1hts39w/)

**Positives**  
There’s a lot to love about this product; here are some of the highlights:  
- Detachable legs make it super portable and convenient.  
- Temperature control knobs let you handle multiple kinds of cooking simultaneously.  
- Sturdy and weather-resistant materials ensure longevity.  
- High energy output (225,000 BTUs) makes outdoor cooking efficient and fast.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Though the product is impressive, there are a few bad points worth mentioning:  
- Flame can flicker and become inconsistent in windy conditions.  
- Screws for the detachable legs could use an upgrade for a more secure fit.  
- Lack of included accessories—consider adding a wind guard or attachment options.

**Competing Products**  
When comparing this propane grill to its closest competitors, its performance stands tall, but there are a few areas where it doesn’t dominate. Take the Camp Chef Explorer 2-Burner Stove, for instance. While the Explorer is a reliable choice for camping and has a slightly lower BTU output (60,000 per burner), it is better suited for those who value simplicity and compactness over raw power. On the other hand, the Blackstone 28-Inch Outdoor Griddle Station offers flat-top versatility, something this unit can’t quite replicate. However, it can’t churn out the same level of heat as the Outvita model, making it less ideal for high-capacity cooking. Ultimately, the Outvita propane grill is the go-to choice if raw energy and multi-task cooking options top your list of priorities.

**Cost Effectiveness**  
Looking at the price-to-quality ratio, the Outvita OV-BURNER-184 is undoubtedly a solid investment for individuals who take outdoor cooking seriously. It might not be the most budget-friendly grill on the market, but its durability, heat output, and versatility make it worth the splurge. Plus, with the detachable legs and portable design, you’re not just getting a grill—you’re getting a convenient all-in-one solution for outdoor cooking. Whether it’s whipping up meals for a small gathering or taking it on RV trips, it delivers an experience that feels like money well spent.

When I first decided to cut out dairy, I honestly had no clue where to start. Everything felt overwhelming milk, butter, cheese, yogurt… it’s literally in *everything*. After a lot of trial and error (and a few disappointing “cheese” purchases), I ended up making myself a little “going dairy-free starter guide.” Thought I’d share in case it helps someone else:

**1. Start with the easy swaps**

* Milk: oat milk and soy milk are the most versatile for me (coffee, cereal, baking). Almond milk is lighter but not great for frothing.
* Butter: vegan butter or just olive oil for cooking. Honestly, I barely miss dairy butter now.

**2. Cheese (the hardest part)**

* Don’t expect an exact replica right away. Nutritional yeast is a lifesaver for a cheesy flavor in sauces.
* Cashew cream works shockingly well for pasta and dips.
* Some store-bought vegan cheeses are hit or miss, so test small portions before committing.

**3. Yogurt & Ice Cream**

* Coconut yogurt is thick and creamy. Soy or almond yogurt if you want it less rich.
* Non-dairy ice creams are everywhere now—oat-based ones are my favorite.

**4. Focus on recipes, not just replacements**  
Instead of trying to find a “perfect vegan version” of everything, look up naturally dairy-free meals. Things like curries, stir fries, bean stews, or pasta with tomato-based sauces. You won’t even notice the missing dairy.

**5. Take it step by step**  
I didn’t go 100% overnight. First I swapped milk, then yogurt, then butter. Cheese was the last to go. Breaking it down made it way less stressful.

That’s basically the guide I wish I had when I first started.

We love it here but feel like we've done all the growing we can here and are ready to move on to greener pastures. We're having trouble deciding on a city we want to live in next, as we're both relatively young and have a lot we want to experience before settling down.

A little bit more about us: I work at an art museum during the days and run sound for concerts in the evenings, so I'm not making a ton of money (about 40k take home pay). My partner just finished the Appalachian Trail and is looking for work but will most likely go back into the service industry for the meantime, so neither of us will be making crazy money. We're looking for a mid-size city to move to that has similarities to Tallahassee that will also provide more opportunities for upwards growth.

Some things we love about the city we're in / things we're looking for are: Access to nature and hiking trails, a thriving arts/music scene, good vegan food, a diverse population and melting pot of cultures, safe queer spaces, etc. Access to some form of public transportation is a plus even though we are severely lacking good public transport in the US. We're fairly left leaning but are not opposed to moving to a red state. Ideally, our new city wouldn't be as unbearable hot and humid as Florida cities tend to be. Our hobbies include rock climbing, hiking, watching movies, playing pool and visiting dive bars, enjoying coffee shops and breweries, and making new friends.

So far, cities we've loved are Louisville KY, Philadelphia PA, and Chicago IL (although Chicago is getting increasingly expensive). I'd love to hear about cities you've lived in post college that you loved and if you think any place might be a good fit for us. We're looking to stay in the US. Thanks!

Edit: I know Philly and Chicago aren't mid-sized cities. We're looking to move somewhere that has similar amenities and communities to those cities on a smaller scale. Appreciate all your suggestions thus far :)",3,1759929648.0,SameGrassButGreener,6,1.0,False

1o1a8q3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o1a8q3/exgirlfriends_didnt_close_the_door_completely_but/,"Ex-girlfriends didn’t close the door completely, but seems to be seeing someone new — should I still have hope?","My ex-girlfriend (26) and I (26) broke up 22 days ago. A week after the breakup, we met to return each other’s belongings. It actually turned into a warm conversation — we had coffee and talked for a long time.

For some background: her reasons for breaking up were my careless behavior in the relationship, my poor financial management, and my constant lateness. Because of these things, she started questioning the relationship and said her feelings had faded. But I knew she loved me deeply — she had been very supportive and stood by me even in my worst times.

During our last talk, I told her that I still had hope for the relationship, that I was ready to fix my mistakes and work on myself. She didn’t object at all. She said something like, “Time will tell. Maybe being apart will help us see more clearly what we really want.”

For our anniversary, she had bought a LEGO set for us to build together. I had completed about 80% of it, so I gave it to her to finish. She said she’d send me a picture once she was done. It was a hopeful conversation about the future.

When we said goodbye, she told me, “Take good care of yourself until we see each other again,” and hugged me. While hugging, I heard her take a deep breath as if she was smelling my scent — that moment made me feel like she still had feelings for me. This meeting gave me a strong sense that she might come back.

We weren’t following each other on Instagram, but we were still connected on Letterboxd (a movie logging app). Two days ago, I called her. She had moved into a new apartment after the breakup, so we talked a bit about her move and my job. Then I asked if she was free the next day to grab a drink or dinner. She said she’d be with her mom and wasn’t available, but added, “If you want, we can meet next week — I still have a few of your things that turned up when I moved.”

I told her, “I don’t care about the stuff; I just want to see you.” She replied with something like, “That’s okay, let’s talk next week.”

Later that evening, I did a bit of stalking and saw that she had recently followed a new guy on Letterboxd. (For context, Letterboxd is a film logging platform.) The guy had added one of her favorite movies to his watchlist. I found his Instagram, and it turns out they went to the same university. I assume they follow each other there too, but since his profile is private, I couldn’t confirm it.

Now I’m confused — during our last meeting, she didn’t close the door completely between us, but now it seems like she’s started talking to someone else. What could that mean? Do you think she’ll come back to me?

Our relationship was really something special — even the people around us admired how good we were together.

He is in Colombia and I in the U.S.  He reached out and commented how beautiful I was and we started talking.  We spoke every single day for hours at a time through the game.  A few months in he asked me if I had a WhatsApp and I did so we connected on there as he said he needed to communicate with me outside the game as he started to care too much.  It started getting odd when he refused to talk on the phone but instead only text.  He also would only send like one pic a month as he said he hated photos.  I checked his number and photos and nothing came up odd so we kept talking.  He never asked me for anything so it didn’t scream catfish.  He did send me a video of himself when asked as I said I needed more from him.  We continued talking but over time he got more distant, we went from talking all day everyday to once or twice a day in passing.  I asked if he was bored and he said he was just depressed.  He would become so angry though and ask why I was like this about messages..he said he didn’t like to text so I asked if we could call and he said we needed to take things slow.  8 months in and calling is too fast?  Needless to say things got better again and I bought a plane ticket to see him (I know, how stupid) but I was really starting to like him.  We planned spending a weekend together but then he asked if I would sleep with him the first night and when I said I didn’t know, he said “so are you just coming to Colombia for coffee with me and to leave?”.  This made me so mad so I asked if sex was a requirement and he said he didn’t want to talk anymore as I was very negative about him which couldn’t have been further from the truth.  I really cared for him and now after 10 months of talking daily, it feels so odd without him.  I deleted him off WhatsApp and he sent me a message in the game how it was goodbye as we complicate everything.  He claims he saw a future with me but not now.  Am I crazy or was this a catfish? Or just a narcissist?  I have been crying about this whole ordeal trying to figure out what the hell happened or if I was just nuts for jumping in in the first place.

Turns out southern baptist affiliated, my specific brand of trauma.

The third time I was there I went to the bathroom and across the mirror it said “fearfully wonderfully” from the verse in the Bible something something about being fearfully and wonderfully made. I figured it was intentional as it was some kind of fancy decal on the mirror. So after seeing that it was like a switch flipped and everywhere I looked I saw Christian undertones. Loaves of bread painted on the wall, a creation of Adam painting, angels on their stickers, people had their bibles out on tables. 
Then I checked their instagram and it was clear and confirmed. Rip.

Another is the episode of Bob’s Burgers where the family is visiting Linda’s parents in their retirement home and when they tell them that it’s a swinger community and Linda doesn’t get it at first “what like dancers? Like golfers?” Then it zooms in to the needle point of “it don’t mean a thing if it ain’t got that swing” and two couples trading partners, etc.

1o19zk6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o19zk6,After spending two weeks in here this is what my impressionable brain came up with and I’m chuffed,"I sold my Moccamaster gear and switched to this setup after soaking up tons of posts in here. Immediate impressions as follows. 

- The Moccamaster grinder has character. You gotta hold the button, it’s noisy and there’s a lot of grind left inside that pops out when you don’t want it to but the sound reminds me of a strong satisfying engine. That said the Ode 2 is such a comfortable experience. You know what I mean. But I’m amazed how low the noise is and how fast it grinds. The first couple of grinds had me wondering if something was wrong because how quickly it turned off. But every gram was accounted for. And the knocker. Well. That’s the good life. 

- The Kalita dripper does something the Moccamaster doesn’t. I don’t want to try and explain too detailed because I have no credentials but I get kinda like a delicious mix between coffee and cacao with the Kalita and my latte beans while the Moccamaster just tastes like good hot coffee from the office. Same beans. Not the ones in the pics btw. 

I don’t know if it’s the grinder or the machine but I can definitely taste a difference. Also how freaking zen is pouring. I never imagined this. What a vibe. 

I ordered a ceramic switch and a b75 to try different styles and see how it impacts the coffee.

We've done our homework on Rome (staying 7 days, hitting museums/churches/usual sites other days), but want Wednesday to be different - relaxed and memorable rather than another sightseeing marathon. Traveling with two teenage sons who are good sports but not foodies.

Current plan is Hotel Forum rooftop for aperitivo at sunset, then dinner on the terrace overlooking the Forum. I'm asking for a front table...

My questions: 

1. Is Hotel Forum actually good, or just good views? I know we're paying for location, but is the food decent or should we do aperitivo there then move elsewhere for dinner?

2. For lunch, considering La Barrique (Via dei Monti). Friend who lived in Rome years ago recommended it, said to request the small private room. Anyone familiar? Is it still good or has it gone downhill?

We care about genuine quality food, not Instagram moments, but atmosphere matters for a milestone birthday. The day is otherwise deliberately light - coffee at Caffè Greco in the morning, wander Spanish Steps area, back to apartment to rest before evening.

what else can i do? small gestures and nice things i can buy her that From Rome would be cool. Beyond dinner, what would make the day feel special? A particular pasticceria for something memorable? Flowers from a specific market? A quintessentially Roman gift she could keep?

Around two weeks ago, on a Thursday, I started having a headache on my left side and didn’t think much of it. As the days went on, I suddenly found myself with a sharp pain on the right side of my head. It felt like the kind of headache you get after oversleeping, so I didn’t pay much attention and just assumed it was coffee withdrawal or something.

Days passed and the pain on the right side kept getting worse, almost like being struck with a bat and dealing with the aftereffects. My right eye became bloodshot (and still is), and the pressure around my eyebrow and temple hurt so badly that I couldn’t bear it and was slowly losing my mind. After a week, I finally went to my GP.

At first, I thought the migraine might’ve been hormonal since my period was near. The doctor prescribed me Metoclopramide, Naproxen, Omeprazole, and Sumatriptan (which hurt my pockets, damn). The Sumatriptan and Naproxen barely worked, and the pain was still very much there, like someone was squeezing down on my head. 
Honestly, I started wondering if it could be a cluster migraine because of the one-sided pain, but after reading others’ experiences on Reddit, I figured it probably wasn’t, especially since I can feel some pain on my left side too. 

At this point, I have no clue what’s going on. The pain has shifted toward the front of my head, around my right temple and forehead, and it’s been unbearable. Yesterday was awful as when I woke up, I was in indescribable pain, especially around my forehead and the bump I noticed four days ago around my hairline/forehead. Honestly, I feel like I’m constantly dealing with a morning headache, and the migraine attacks are horrendous. There’s barely any moment of peace, as my head is always hurting or feeling foggy. I decided to head back to the GP the next day, as I was told to come back after a week.

When I got there, the doctor barely showed any sympathy and refused to refer me to a neurologist, even after two weeks of this pain as I need to follow “the steps” and take new medication’s in order to be referred !? Originally, I declined the triptan because I’d already been prescribed Metoclopramide, Naproxen, Omeprazole, and Sumatriptan, and I didn’t want to pay for yet another medication when I still had a bunch left. The doctor then told me to continue taking Naproxen and increase my dose (even though that didn’t work the first time). But minutes after leaving, I changed my mind and went back to ask for the triptan, since I wouldn’t be able to proceed with getting referred to a neurologist otherwise. And then the doctor refused!?  

In the end, I managed to get the triptan prescription, but it’s honestly so frustrating how many hoops we have to jump through just to get referred in the first place — and it doesn’t help how dismissive they are and how they want to rush me out. I brought up the possibility of PCOS being connected with my migraines, but they dismissed it and told me to book a separate appointment, which was really annoying. 

It’s frustrating bc if this new triptan doesn’t work, I would have spent my money for nothing!?  When being referred would have just been quicker than putting me on a bunch of medication which we know doesn’t work!? (Plus I’m already medicated) It’s been two weeks now and I’m still suffering from a migraine, and my health is already weak as it is. TLDR I’m just tired of these doctor and the games we have to play in order to get a referral sigh. ",3,1759928390.0,migraine,3,0.8,False

We currently just moved into a new neighborhood and town in North Carolina. On the corner of the street there is a sex offender. His mother owns the home and was recently sent to a nursing home, as he was neglecting her care. 

Since she has been gone he has begun showing his predator behavior. Before, when his mother was in the household he never showed himself, usually stayed inside unless someone came over to visit his mother. Now that his mother is gone he will very creepily stare at me when i walk my dogs. THE ENTIRE TIME I AM IN EYE SHOT HE WILL STARE AT ME EVEN MOVING WINDOWS OR DOORS TO FOLLOW MY EVERY MOVE. The issue is he will wait for my significant other to get far enough away from me or for me to be completely alone and then he will begin his behavior. The reason I know this is because my first encounter with him was extremely frightening. Early in the morning we walk the dogs around the neighborhoods, usually about 7AM and then again around 7PM. On our way back my partner had already made it home as we only live three houses down from him. I was bent over in front of his home giving my dog a treat for going potty and my dog was taking a second to take the treat. When i stood up I felt uneasy and turned around only to find this creep standing 3 feet away from me in his boxers with a cup of coffee, when I gasped and said ""HOLY FUCK!"" he ran back into his home. The distance from his back door and front door is a significant distance from the road. The fact he was so quiet and I didn't hear a thing tells me he was being sneaky or had been waiting for me. I am very aware of my surroundings and had just looked around me before i gave my dog a treat. I DO THIS EVERY SINGLE TIME I STOP WALKING. I've been mugged before and am hyper aware of my surroundings. I immediately went home and told my significant other and asked that my boyfriend stay close enough to me as that felt like a predator stalking its prey and i felt extremely uncomfortable. 

  
So many other times have happened since then. 

***I'd also like to note, I have spoken to him in person and he admitted to me ""I watch you walk your dogs morning and night, every. single. day."". In those words with emphasis on every single day.*** 

This morning is one of those times and it really shook me up, and I need advice. I was walking my dog and he was taking a while to use the bathroom again. I don't like to stop in front of or even near this mans home. My dog had already used the bathroom but usually uses it twice before getting back home. My dog is old, so where he wants to go that's where we go. We were on the other side of the street, technically in front of creeps house, when I kept hearing someone saying something. I refused to turn around as I knew it was the creep. I did check both sides of me to make sure there was no one else. I tried to hurry my dog along to get away from his house. When i was in the middle of our houses, i heard more mumbling and used my umbrella to shield myself from him seeing me looking at his home to see if it was in fact him making the noises and it was. So i intentionally turned to look at him AND HIS WHOLE HEAD WAS OUT HIS WINDOW!!!! When he saw me he BOLTED BACK INSIDE LIKE HE GOT CAUGHT!!! Shivers went through my whole body and I felt like vomiting. As i walked quickly back to my house he stuck his head back out the window arms and all and watched me walk to my house, up my driveway. This man makes me feel so unsafe. Of course my boyfriend can't be with me all of the times I'm walking the dogs, as he travels for work. I do have pepper spray but honestly that's not enough for me to feel safe around this creep. He literally left his mother bleeding out in her bed for two days and told the ambulance to take her to a home. I have to walk past his house because the other end of the street is a busy highway. He does live withing 100ft of a park as well which is against the law in NC, it must be 300ft and he literally lives on the corner facing the park. 



I need to know what to do about this and what my rights are. I don't feel safe and literally just moved here. ",0,1759928231.0,legaladvice,2,0.4,False

It wasn’t after another [ghosting situation](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) or [another “it’s not you, it’s me” conversation](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). It was on a random Tuesday morning when I caught myself scrolling through my [ex’s Instagram](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) while my coffee went cold. Again.

The pit in my stomach wasn’t new. It was the same hollow feeling I’d carried through [every failed relationship](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) — the gnawing sense that I was fundamentally broken, that [everyone else had figured out love except me](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). I realized I’d been carrying the[ same patterns, the same questions, the same heartbreak](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) through every relationship for the past decade. And I was so [tired of being tired](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

At thirty-two, I’d tried everything, [therapy sessions](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) where I dissected my childhood, I [downloaded every mental health app](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) promising anxiety relief that sent me [daily affirmations I didn’t believe](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), dating coaches who told me to “just be confident,” even that phase where I [swore off relationships](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) entirely to “focus on myself.” But [nothing seemed to break the cycle](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). I kept choosing [emotionally unavailable people](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). I kept ignoring red flags so bright they could light up a highway. I kept [wondering why I couldn’t just get it right.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

Then October came, and with it, whispers about something [called the 10:10 portal](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). I didn’t know it yet, but I was about to stop running from myself.

# What Is the 10:10 Portal? Why It Mattered to Someone Like Me

I’ll be honest, I’d seen angel numbers before. [The 11:11 wishes, the 3:33 when you’re thinking about someone](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). I’d always dismissed them as confirmation bias, the brain finding patterns where none existed. But the [10:10 portal kept appearing everywhere](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), and something about it felt different. Urgent, even.

The [10:10 portal on October 10th](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) represents a [powerful energetic gateway ](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)— a moment when the veil between our current reality and our highest [potential becomes incredibly thin](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). I’d spent years searching online for [relationship advice or spiritual guidance](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) for heartbreak, understanding [cosmic timing can be the difference between another failed attempt](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) and actual transformation.

**Why the 10:10 Portal Resonated with My Broken Heart:**

* **Amplified clarity**: The [doubled energy creates a window](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) when denial becomes transparent. I’d been lying to myself for so long, I didn’t even [know what truth looked like anymore](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)
* **Cosmic completion**: The [number 10 symbolizes endings and new beginnings](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). I was so ready for an ending any ending, [to this exhausting cycle](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)
* **Pattern interruption**: The [heightened energy disrupts habitual dynamics](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). My patterns had become so automatic, I needed something powerful enough to [break toxic relationship cycles](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) I couldn’t see clearly
* **Nervous system reset**: After [years of relationship anxiety and stress](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), my body was stuck in [permanent fight-or-flight](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). The portal offered energetic support for [releasing trauma responses ](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)I didn’t know how to release alone

I didn’t fully understand it then, but I was desperate enough to try. And desperation, it turns out, [can be the doorway to transformation](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) when you’ve finally hit bottom.

# What Relationship Trauma Actually Looked Like

My last relationship ended [eighteen months before the portal](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), but I was still living in its wreckage. Arjun had been [my “almost” almost ready to commit](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), almost emotionally available, almost the person I needed him to be. For two years, I’d [performed emotional gymnastics trying to be enough](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), trying to fix what was [fundamentally broken between us](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

The breakup wasn’t dramatic. I almost wish it had been. Instead, it was slow erosion, [like watching myself disappear](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). One day he said he “needed space to figure things out,” and that [space turned into silence](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). No closure. No explanation. Just me, left analyzing every conversation, every text, every moment, convinced that if [I could just understand what I’d done wrong, I could fix myself.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

But here’s what I couldn’t admit to anyone, not even my therapist: [I was terrified of being alone](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). Not lonely, alone with myself. Because when the [distractions faded and the apartment was quiet](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), I heard this voice that said, “See? You’re not worth staying for. [You’re too much and not enough all at once.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)”

**The aftermath of relationship trauma looked like this:**

* Insomnia where I’d lie awake at 3 AM, composing texts I’d never send, [imagining conversations](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) where I finally said the right thing
* Hypervigilance in new dating situations, analyzing every word, every pause, every shift in energy, [always waiting for the other shoe to drop](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)
* Physical symptoms I’d normalized: tight chest when my phone was silent too long, [racing heart whenever a texting pattern changed](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), nausea before dates
* Complete erosion of self-trust. I [second-guessed every instinct, every feeling, every reaction](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

My therapist [called it relationship trauma](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). My body was stuck in [survival mode, and I’d become a stranger to myself](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). The stress and anxiety from [failed relationships wasn’t just emotional anymore](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), it was cellular, woven into how I moved through the world.

I needed [stress management tools, yes](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). But more than that, I needed to understand why [I kept choosing people who made me feel this way](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). Why I mistook anxiety for chemistry. Why I confused [someone’s inconsistency with mystery](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). Why I kept [abandoning myself to keep someone else](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

# Why I Finally Turned to Tarot (When Nothing Else Worked)

I’d been researching [best apps for relationship advice](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) and online [relationship coaching platforms](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) for weeks, bookmarking articles I never read, [downloading apps I never opened](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). Everything felt too corporate, too formulaic, too… empty. I didn’t need [another seven-step program or relationship framework](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). I needed someone to see me — actually see me — and [tell me the truth I was too afraid to face alone](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

[That’s when I found coto](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

What stopped my endless scrolling wasn’t slick marketing or promises of [finding my soulmate](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). It was their approach. Unlike other [top astrology apps that offered generic daily horoscope readings](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), coto specialized in spiritual healing for relationship trauma. They weren’t [selling predictions — they were offering mirrors](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). A way to [see what I’d been avoiding](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

I’d had [tarot readings before, at parties, at street fairs](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), quick [ten-minute sessions that felt more like entertainment than insight](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). But this time, I wasn’t looking for entertainment. [I was looking for a lifeline](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

[The Love Clarity Spread caught my attention](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb): a focused online tarot [reading for relationships designe](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)d to show you what’s actually [happening beneath your denial](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), why you keep attracting the same patterns, and one [clear action you can take today](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). Not someday. Today.

[The 10:10 portal was three days away](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). I booked a [session before I could talk myself out of it.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

# The 5-Card Love Clarity Spread: Why This Structure Matters

Before my session, I researched [what made this spread different from the countless relationship compatibility readings](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) I’d seen advertised. The [5-card structure isn’t arbitrary](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) — it’s specifically designed for people who are stuck, who keep hitting the same wall, [who need more than vague spiritual platitudes.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

**The Five Positions Reveal:**

1. **Present situation**: Where you [actually stand, not where you pretend to be](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)
2. **Hidden obstacle**:[ What’s really blocking you](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) (usually yourself)
3. **What to release**: The [beliefs keeping you trapped](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)
4. **What to embrace**: Who you’re [being called to become](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)
5. **Immediate action**: One [concrete step to take today](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

What made this [structure powerful for someone dealing with relationship anxiety](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) wasn’t just the spiritual framework, it was the [psychological precision](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). Each position asked me to [confront something specific](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). No escape routes. No [“maybe it means this or maybe it means that.”](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) Just truth, laid bare.

This online tarot consultation [format combined accurate astrology predictions with trauma-informed psychology](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). It wasn’t about my future, it was about my present, [seen so clearly I couldn’t look away](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

# How coto Connected Me with Sara (And Why That Mattered)

The [coto platform felt different from other mental health support platforms](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) I’d tried. Instead of algorithms matching me randomly with whoever was available, I could [browse detailed practitioner profiles](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), their [training, their specializations, their actual approach to healing](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

Sara’s profile made me cry [before I even booked the session](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

She described her work as “[holding up mirrors with compassion](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).” Fifteen years of tarot practice [combined with psychology training, specializing in relationship patterns and trauma-informed approaches](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). But it was her philosophy that got me: “I don’t [read cards to tell you what will happen](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). I [read cards to show you what’s already happening beneath the surface](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), so you can make different choices.”

I didn’t need someone to tell me my future. I needed someone to show me [my present, the one I’d been running from](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

**What made** [**booking through coto feel safer**](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)**:**

* I could see Sara’s face, read her words, get a sense of her [energy before committing](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)
* Transparent scheduling ,[no pressure, no urgency tactics](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)
* Choice of [video, audio, or chat (I chose video because I needed to see someone’s face)](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)
* Clear investment structure that respected[ both my financial reality and the seriousness of the work](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

I scheduled the session [for the morning of the 10:10 portal](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). If I was going to do this, [I wanted the universe’s full attention.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

# Before You Continue Reading, Take a Moment

Stop here. Really stop.

[What pattern keeps showing up in your relationships? Write it down before reading further.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

Is it choosing people who are [emotionally unavailable?](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) [Ignoring red flags](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) while hoping they’ll change? [Losing yourself trying to keep someone else?](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

Do you [mistake anxiety for chemistry](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)? Do you abandon yourself to [keep someone else?](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

If you answered yes to both, if you recognize yourself in these patterns [what you’re about to read next might feel uncomfortably familiar](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). That discomfort? That’s recognition. [And recognition is the first step to breaking free.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

Now keep reading.

# The Five Cards That Changed Everything

When Sara appeared on screen, she didn’t start with small talk or performative mysticism. She looked at me with this quiet intensity and asked: [“What do you need clarity on today?”](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

And I started crying. Not delicate tears, ugly, snotty, gasping crying. [Because no one had asked me that in so long](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). What did *I* need? Not what would make [someone else stay, not what would make me more loveable, not what would finally make me enough](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). What did I actually need?

“I need to [understand why I keep choosing people who make me feel like I’m disappearing](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb),” I finally said. “[I need to know if I’m broken. And I need to know how to stop.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)”

Sara nodded like [she’d heard this a thousand times](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), like my particular brand of pain wasn’t unique but it still mattered. Then she[ began the reading.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

**Card 1 — Two of Cups Reversed (Present Situation)**

“You’ve been seeking [completion through others rather than coming to relationships already whole](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb),” Sara explained. “Every person you choose, you’re [secretly hoping they’ll fix the parts of you that feel broken](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). But you [can’t receive love when you’re convinced you’re unworthy](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) of it.”

I felt that [truth land in my chest like a stone](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

**Card 2 — Seven of Swords (Hidden Obstacle)**

“This is the [self-deception card](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). Your [biggest obstacle isn’t the men you choose](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), it’s the lies you tell yourself about them. The ways you minimize [red flags, rationalize poor treatment, convince yourself](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) that if you just [communicate better or love harder, things will change](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).”

I thought about Arjun. How many times had friends expressed concern while [I defended him with “you don’t understand our connection”?](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) The [anxiety and stress](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) I’d been carrying wasn’t random, it was my body screaming what [my mind refused to hear](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

**Card 3 — The Devil (What to Release)**

“What you’re being [called to release during this 10:10 portal](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) isn’t just past relationships, it’s [your addiction to the chase](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). To proving you’re worthy. To the [intensity you’ve confused with love](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).”

Sara paused, let that sink in. “You’re [addicted to people who can’t love you back because their ambivalence gives you a project](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). Something to fix, something to [focus on besides yourself](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). If someone was fully [available and consistent](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), you wouldn’t know what to do with that.”

I wanted to argue. But she was right. [The anxiety, the wondering, the constant analyzing, I’d mistaken all of it for passion](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

**Card 4 — The Empress (What to Embrace)**

“The Empress is about becoming your own source. You’re being called to [radical self-love, not the Instagram version](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), but the daily practice of [treating yourself like someone worth staying for](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).”

Then she asked the question that changed everything: “What would your life look like if you [became the most reliable, caring, consistent person in your own life](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)? If you showed up for yourself the way [you’ve been showing up for people who barely show up for you?](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)”

I didn’t have an answer. I’d never even considered it.

**Card 5 — Ace of Swords (Immediate Action)**

“The Ace of Swords is [about cutting through illusion with truth](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). Your action today, right now, [during this 10:10 portal while the energy is supporting you is to write down every truth](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) you’ve been avoiding about your relationship patterns. Not to judge yourself, but to finally see clearly.”

She was specific: “Write down [every red flag you ignored and told yourself didn’t matter](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). Write down what you actually need from a [partner versus what you’ve been settling for](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). Write down who you [become when you’re seeking validation versus who you are when you feel secure](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). This portal is [giving you the strength to face these truths](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) without collapsing under them.”

# The Work That Actually Changed Me

Sara didn’t end the[ session with “good luck” or vague encouragement](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). She gave me a protocol, specific, structured, unyielding. A [stress management practice that was really a complete re-wiring](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

**Days 1–3: Radical Truth-Telling**

I spent three days with my journal, writing truths I’d been avoiding for years. The list was devastating:

* Arjun showed [me exactly who he was in month two](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), consistently canceling plans, only available late at night, never [introducing me to his friends](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) and I’d ignored it all, hoping [my patience would inspire his change](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)
* Mayank explicitly said [he wasn’t ready for commitment](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), and I’d convinced myself [I could be so amazing he’d change his mind](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)
* Jay love-[bombed me for three months,](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) and when the intensity faded, I [blamed myself for not being exciting enough to maintain it](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

I kept choosing people who were ambivalent while I became [frantically invested](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). Every single time.

**Days 4–7: Pattern Recognition and Nervous System Work**

Sara taught me [grounding techniques for when the anxiety spiked](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). Because facing these truths made my body panic. Every time I wrote something [honest, my chest tightened, my breath shallowed, my mind screamed “stop, this is too much.”](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

But Sara had said: “The [anxiety is your nervous system trying to protect you from change. Breathe through it. The discomfort is growth, not danger](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).”

I tracked my emotional states. [Calm came when I was fully present with myself , cooking, reading, walking without my phone](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). Anxiety spiked when I was [seeking external validation](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), checking if that guy from the [dating app had texted back, refreshing social media for likes, waiting for someone else to make me feel okay.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

**Day 8–10: The** [**10:10 Portal Release Ceremony**](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

[On October 10th at 10:10 AM](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), I sat on my living room floor with papers I’d written the night before. Each [one contained a belief that had been running my life:](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

* “I need to be [perfect to be loved](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)”
* “Asking for [what I need pushes people away](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)”
* “If I’m alone, [something is wrong with me](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)”
* “[Love should feel like anxious intensity](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)”
* “I’m responsible [for making relationships work](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), even when the other person isn’t trying”

I read each one aloud, then burned it in a metal bowl. It felt [dramatic and necessary and terrifying](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). With each paper that turned to ash, I felt something release in my chest. Not completely. But [enough to breathe deeper.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

**Days 11–14: Embodying the Empress**

The final phase was the hardest because it required becoming someone new. Sara gave me [daily practices that felt uncomfortable specifically because I wasn’t used to prioritizing myself](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb):

* Morning check-ins asking [“What do I actually need today?” and then *doing that thing*](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)
* Boundary practice, [saying no to social obligations that depleted me](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), even when people were disappointed
* Mirror work, [two minutes daily looking at myself, speaking words of genuine care](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) (this one made me cry every time)
* Planning dates with myself I [actually looked forward to, treating them as seriously as I would dates with someone](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) I was trying to impress

# What Actually Changed (The Uncomfortable Truth)

Three weeks after my session with Sara, I went on a date. He was attractive, successful, interesting on paper. The [kind of person the old me would have molded myself around.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

Midway through dinner, I caught myself doing it again, [laughing too hard at mediocre jokes, minimizing my accomplishments](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) when he seemed uncomfortable with my success, already [mentally adjusting my schedule to accommodate his availability.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

And something shifted. I saw [myself from outside my body, saw the old pattern activating in real-time](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). The [Seven of Swords card flashed in my mind, the self-deception, the performance, the abandoning of myself.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

So I stopped. Right there at the restaurant. I stayed [authentic the rest of the evening](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). When he made a [dismissive comment about therapy](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), I said honestly that therapy had changed my life. When he suggested we “keep things casual,” [I said clearly that casual wasn’t what I was looking for](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

There was no second date. And instead of [spiraling, analyzing what I’d done wrong, how I’d pushed him away](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), what I could have said differently, I felt *proud*. [For the first time in a decade of dating, I’d chosen myself in real-time.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

**What actually measurably changed:**

* My sleep improved, [falling asleep within 20 minutes](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) instead of lying awake for hours replaying conversations
* Phone checking [decreased from 40+ times daily to less than 10](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)
* I ended a [promising-but-misaligned connection](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) after two weeks instead of dragging it out for months
* The constant [low-grade anxiety that had been my baseline](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) started to quiet

The [relationship clarity I’d been seeking wasn’t about finding better people](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). It was about becoming [someone who could recognize mis-alignment as it was happening and choose differently](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

# Six Months Later: Still Single, Finally Whole

I’m writing this [six months after the 10:10 portal](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). I’m still single. And I’m [not going to lie and say I’m completely healed](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) or that I never feel [lonely or that I’ve figured everything out.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

But something fundamental has shifted. I’m [no longer tired in that bone-deep way I was before](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). I’m no longer [frantically searching, no longer convinced that being chosen by someone else will finally make me whole](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

I’ve been on a few dates since then. One developed into a brief connection that[ I ended when I noticed the familiar signs his inconsistency, my tendency to over-accommodate, the anxiety creeping back like an old friend](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). The old me would have white-knuckled through it, trying to make it work. The [new me recognized that relationship compatibility isn’t about potential — it’s about present reality](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

What surprises me most is [how the changes rippled beyond romance](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). I set boundaries at work. I [released friendships where I was doing all the emotional labor](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). I started making choices based on what I actually wanted [rather than what would make others happy](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

The transformation [Sara helped me access through that online tarot reading wasn’t about predictions or future promises](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). It was about seeing [my present so clearly, my patterns, my fears, my ways of abandoning myself, that my future could unfold differently.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

The [10:10 portal didn’t fix me](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). Sara didn’t fix me. But they both showed me that [I wasn’t broken in the first place](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). I was just operating from old [programming that no longer fit who I was becoming](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

# What I’d Tell Someone Where I Was

If you’re reading this and you see yourself in my story, exhausted from [failed relationships, wondering why you can’t break the pattern, convinced everyone else figured out love except you](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), I want you to know something:

You’re not broken. [You’re just stuck in patterns](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) you can’t see clearly [enough to change alone.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

The [10:10 portal taught me that true love](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) isn’t something that happens to you when you finally become enough. It’s [something you become available for when you stop abandoning yourself](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) trying to keep someone else.

[Getting that online tarot reading during the portal wasn’t magic](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). It was a mirror held up with enough compassion that[ I could finally look at myself without collapsing](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). Sara didn’t tell me my future, she showed me my [present with such clarity that I couldn’t unsee it.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

And that [clarity has been worth everything](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb). Not because it brought me a relationship, [but because it brought me back to myself](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).

When I was [ready for my breakthrough](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), I found practitioners [on coto who specialized in seeing patterns](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb) I couldn’t see alone. If you’re where I was [exhausted, stuck, desperate for clarity](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb), that same kind of mirror might be waiting for you too.

[Not because you’re broken. But sometimes we need someone outside our pain to show us the way through it.](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb)

Your clarity is waiting. [And you’re worth the investment of finding it](https://app.coto.world/imtHd55uiXb).",1,1759928018.0,u_cotoapp25,0,1.0,False

I don’t want to chase you, I really don’t. But I can’t stop thinking about you. Even in all my growth, all my self understanding, I can only see that it’s you I want to treat better. I know I was unwilling to change during our time together, I know I didn’t make you feel safe or heard with me. I was acting from a place of unrecognised trauma and now that I see it, I hate that behaviour. I hate how it must of made you feel. Bumping into you the other day reminded me that I still miss you. That I haven’t truly moved on. I know you have and that hurts. You might not believe in going back, in giving second chances, but I ask if you are willing to move forward. To meet for a coffee and just talk about it. I want to be there celebrating your successes, holding space for your failures. I want to hold you when life gets tough and let you know that you are deeply loved, deeply cared for. 

You said you’d been back with exes in the past and it never works, but what if that’s because of who they were? The person I am becoming, I want to share with you. I want to hold your hand in the darkest of nights and run through forests with you. I want to see the world with you and prioritise you. You tried to reach me but I hid. You tried to meet me halfway but I didn’t know where I was. It’s only in the quiet, the absence, that when I sit with myself I can see how we match on so many levels. My therapy is helping me understand so much and I am loving the person I am becoming.

I’m not saying you were perfect and did everything right. I’m not trying to place you on a pedestal, but I am seeing you in all your light and shade and I want that too.  

I know you don’t wanna hear from me. I’m continuing my growth and progress for me too. I am shutting the door and getting excited about myself, but I guess, I haven’t locked it. So if you ever do change your mind one day, please, don’t feel any type of way about reaching out. I’ll always have love for you regardless. ",4,1759928014.0,UnsentLetters,5,0.83,False

*Somewhere on Highway 26.*

 

“Course, I didn’t even see him come up on me, too busy trying to put my tent together, I just heard my brother shout *‘Howard! Turn around!’* and sure enough when I turned there was the biggest alligator I ever seen with my ankle between his teeth and I pulled that leg out just before he went *snap*! The teeth caught the sole of my shoe and ripped it right off my foot!” Howard laughed, wiping a tear from his eye.

I was laughing too.

“What did you do next?”

Howard looked at me and shook his head. “You wouldn’t even believe it…”

“I would!” I insisted, eager to hear how his story ended.

Howard’s eyes lifted from the road as if to look up and retrieve the memory from the stars.

“I lept over my tent, just stood there frozen staring at this monster and he is staring at me, and I tell you this alligator laughed.”

“Laughed? Alligators can’t laugh!” I refuted.

“This one did.” Howard assured me, “*Ha-Ha-Ha*, like that…. Then it just backed into the water again, disappeared completely, not a bubble. I said to my brother, “*Get me the hell out of here, that damn gator can keep the shoe!*”

A green sign materialized out from the darkness.

**Taghorn: 20 Miles**

**Garden Rock: 80 Miles**

**Lakesville: 170 Miles.**

Howard checked his watch and yawned.

“Good diner up in Taghorn, you like eggs?” He asked.

I shrugged, “Yeah I guess.”

“I could do with some coffee.”

I looked out to a passing country shrouded in darkness to reveal nothing of where we could be. A ghostly reflection of myself stared back through the window and I could see Howard staring behind me. I looked at him, and his eyes were on the road again.

“Are you from Eastpoint?” I asked him.

“Who me? Yeah, could say I am.” He answered.

“But you were going to Lakesville?”

“That’s correct. I’m in between at the moment. Got some family up there I’m gonna stay with over the weekend. It’s my brother’s birthday actually.”

“I feel like I’ve seen you before.” I said to him, something familiar about this person driving like a puzzle piece that fit somewhere in memory. Talkative Howard paused, he heard me but did not answer straight away, he glanced at the rearview mirror and cleared his throat.

“It’s possible.” He muttered. “It’s a small town.”

“I’m worried that my parents tried to pick me up, or that I was wrong about this whole thing.” I admitted.

Howard was letting another car overtake him.

“Oh, I wouldn’t worry about it. I’m sure that was their initial plan, but stuff *does* happen. Hell, my folks left me in some places.” He chuckled.

In the distance I could see glowing dots appearing down the hill. A small town. Taghorn.

When we pulled into the dirt parking lot, the neon sign of the diner was like a stellar beacon on a dark planet, as if trucks bound for the Las Vegas strip had it fall from their cargo and here it stayed, repurposed. There were a few cars already parked, the car that passed us was getting gas at the station further down. In the window of the diner some lone travelers held cutlery to pancakes and from their coffee cup’s steam rose to form apparitions of ghostly company in their solitary booths. An old man sat hands clasped to his chin, pondering the limited future and thanked a waitress with a nod.

I unbuckled my seatbelt, but Howard stopped me.

“Wait in the car, little miss, I’ll bring you back some eggs.”

He opened the door and left for the diner, leaving me with the rhythmic vibrations of the idling engine. As he walked hands hidden in his jacket pockets, a couple stopped him.

They seemed to recognize him as smiles formed on their faces, and they were quick to shake hands. They stood talking. Howard pointed back at his car with me inside and the couple turned to look and waved at me. I waved back. Howard said a last goodbye to them as he opened the diner’s door. The couple got inside a truck and then their taillights passed into the night as another thing devoured.

Howard disappeared into the diner and I sat waiting. Boredom turned into curiosity, so I looked behind at the back seat. There was a canvas gym bag, a black pen, a stained baseball cap and the crumpled leftovers of a drive-thru dinner and receipts. I turned the dial of the radio and a roar of static came through, but also a man’s voice:

‘*(***Inaudible***)’s Estate has urged the thief to come forward and return the remains of (***Inaudible***) to the (***Inaudible***) Memorial Gardens in Hollywood.*’

I turned the radio off again, the signal was still awful.

I looked at the dashboard behind the steering wheel and saw a gas tank over half full and a picture of a woman, a crease ran through her face like the image was mostly kept folded. I studied the black scuff marks on the glove compartment in front of me, struck into plastic like the scratched tallies of a jailcell calendar. I looked at the footwells, and that’s when I saw a piece of pink fabric wedged beneath his seat.

Curious, I leant over and pinched the cloth between my fingers and pulled it free where it un-scrunched and fell into its shape, where to my horror, I saw it was a pair of my missing underwear.

I wanted to be wrong, that they were not mine. I had not seen that pair for over a week and hoped by some strange, concerning coincidence, I had found ones that were the exact pattern and size that I had blamed the other orphaned girls for stealing.

At that age, my gut feeling knew more than I did, and I should have listened to it. If I could go back, I would have run from that car. I would have gone to someone. I would have done differently. I wouldn’t have run away from Eastpoint.

I shoved the underwear back under his seat. How would I have brought that up? Was that a conversation I was willing to have at that time and place? It wasn’t. Before I could think of what to do, I looked up to see Howard walking back to the car. He carried two Styrofoam containers that steamed like rail locomotives on route. He opened the door and hurried inside to escape from the biting chill and turned up the heat and held his hands to the vents to warm them. He passed me my scrambled eggs where a plastic fork was stabbed upright. Howard shoveled his food into his mouth and sipped his coffee. We sat in silence only to eat and watch people go about their nocturnal doings until he wiped his hands and said “Alrighty” before he flicked his headlights on and took the park brake off. Then we were on the road again.

He checked his watch; whatever time it read raised no concern. I thought about asking him why he had my- or any girls’ underwear in his car. But I didn’t want to invite whatever might have followed, being out there on the road in the middle of nowhere, the discomfort of the question was more bearable than the discomfort of the answer.

“Who’s that in the picture?” I asked, pointing at the photograph taped on the dashboard. He lifted his thumbs from the wheel to look.

“That’s uh…That’s just the most beautiful creature to ever live.” He declared.

“Oh. That your wife?”

Howard tilted his head to the side as if my guess was somewhat correct.

“Eh, something like that…You ever watch old movies? The black and white ones?”

I shook my head.

“Okay well. She used to star in them. She was an actress.”

“Oh…cool. How did you meet?” I asked.

“Well…I always was her biggest fan. She signed a poster for me once, didn’t say anything but drew a little love heart on it too. I knew then she liked me.”

“You knew she liked you?”

“Uh huh. No doubt about it. Her last movie ever, there’s this scene where she is looking out the window, and someone opens the door. She stares straight at the camera and says ‘*I remember you. Even though years have gone by, how could I forget such love?”* Man…when I saw that I just couldn’t believe it. I knew she was talking to me.” Howard reminisced with a lover’s smile.

I didn’t really know what to say after that. Even though I was young teenager, I knew there was something not quite right about how Howard saw the world. I stared out of the window, hoping something would appear worth talking about, but the silence was too uncomfortable, it made me nervous.

“She uh…You said her last movie? She doesn’t act anymore?”

Howard nodded. “Yeah…there was a…what do you call it…an accident I’d say…You know, you *do* have her eyes. That’s good.” He said.

I forced a smile, but I didn’t mean it.

“Something wrong?” Howard asked me.

I hated that he said that. It was like he knew I didn’t believe him and wanted to know what I had to say about it.

“Um. Well. I just saw that you had girls’ underwear under your seat, just *right there*.” I admitted as I pointed to them.

Howard screwed his face up as he lifted his arms and legs to look around the bottom of his car seat. Keeping his eyes on the road, he took his hand and patted the general area until he finally felt what I was talking about. He pulled the underwear free and laid them on his lap.

“Oh!” He recoiled, before tossing them into the back seat.

“Listen, I’m borrowing this car from a friend of mine. I’m fixing it for her. She had her whole wardrobe in this thing. Thought I took all her clothes out.” Howard laughed and wiped his hands on his pants.

I chuckled. I did; I guess it made enough sense. Maybe I felt relieved, maybe I didn’t. But I just wanted to get to Lakesville.

“So you’re a mechanic?” I asked him.

“No. I work in sanitation and waste management.” He said, and that’s when I knew I had seen him before.

“Wait a minute. You’re the janitor at-

“At Eastpoint’s Group Home for Girls, yep. You know something… I picked you for a runaway the moment I saw you.” He said.

“On the highway?”

“At your school desk.” He interrupted. “Don’t worry! I ain’t gonna snitch. I helped them other two girls.”

“You helped Beth and Janey? Where did they go?” I wondered.

Howard stared at the road; he took a moment to answer.

“I can’t tell you that.”

“They were my friends.” I said to him.

“Then I’m sorry.” He replied.

Howard checked his watch again and cleared his throat but did not say anything else. A sign that said ***Gardner: 10 Miles*** appeared from the dark, and Howard checked his watch once more. We passed some roadside crosses, shrines made for the unlucky who crashed on these roads, new flowers told of still grieving families.

“It’s just that…I told them girls I wouldn’t tell no one. They wanted to disappear, had this whole thing planned.” He confessed.

“Okay…” I muttered.

Howard turned onto another road, then came to stop behind a timber truck hauling white Aspin logs. He followed that truck until he merged onto another main road. After a while another sign flew past us.

‘***Camden: 5 Miles***

***Eden Springs: 20 Miles***

***Scorville: 100 Miles***.’

When the detectives asked me how I knew he was going the wrong way, how I knew we were no longer heading to Lakesville the normal route, I told them that I remebered that sign. *That* apparently helped a lot in finding the gate. I didn’t ask Howard about it at the time and looking back, it wouldn’t have done anything anyway. There seemed to be more traffic on that road, and I began to realize the gravity of what I had done. When morning comes, all the teachers and social workers will be in a frenzy, the police will get called. I started to feel the twisting knot of guilt in my stomach.

“If Miss Fortescue finds me… I’m going to be in a lot of trouble. I’m already in a lot of trouble, aren’t I?” I spoke.

Howard stared ahead, “Eh, I wouldn’t worry about it.”

Then he turned on his indicator and slowed down. At first, I thought there was something wrong with the car, maybe he realized he made a wrong turn. But he veered off the road and carefully drove in the ditch until a tiny clearing appeared in the woods, nothing more than a break in the tree line. The car bounced and shook side to side as we drove over uneven ground, and Howard pulled the wheel and turned onto on a dirt road seen only in the headlights.

“Where are you going?”  I argued as we disappeared into the woods.

He looked at the rearview mirror “My wife lives this way. Were gonna ask her about your parents, try to getchya home.”

Year 1, we did the Fives Beach Resort in Playa del Carmen (we got upgraded and stayed at the Beachfront, which was the new adult-only, very private wing, with golf carts to the main part of the resort). Year 2, we did the Excellence Punta Cana.



We had pros and cons for each, and they boil down to the checklist below. From highest priority to lowest, we are looking for a resort with:

-Fantastic, consistent service (The Beachfront had a whatsapp concierge/ambassador that scheduled everything for us and always checked in, the Excellence did not and didn't do reservations)

-Adults only!!!

-Not huge, with big enough pools that you probably won't be swimming right on top of other people

-Really good food with lots of restaurant options, with a poolside menu (Excellence had great food, but no poolside) and poolside waiter service

-Relaxed dress code (Excellence required long sleeves almost everywhere? In the summer??)

-Sizable rooms (Beachfront was very small, Excellence was huge and had a jacuzzi in almost every room)

-A terrific and quiet spa

-More breakfast restaurants than buffets (boyfriend got food poisoning last year from a buffet)

-Limited extra charges for things like coffee or milkshakes

-Coconut drinks :)



We have no preference for location, and our budget is between $3-5k for a week, not including flights. We usually go near the end of May/beginning of June.

Let us know of anywhere that fits most of these items!!! We honestly don't even know where to begin looking. Thank you!!

When I met her, she was newly divorced and she has been single for the last 10 years, dating guys here and there trying to find the right one. 

About two years after we met, we both had a drunken night at her house and we slept together. That was the one and only time… we both realized we really really like men and only men. We laughed it off in the morning, and that was it.

Our friendship continued and again we’re very close. We do lots together with our kids. She’s the first friend I call and vice versa. She’s the sister I never had, minus that one night.

Fast forward to six weeks ago she started dating a new man and she really seems to like him. We decided to do a double date for me to meet him at the museum.. but I noticed she was a little bit off towards me. Not as friendly and bubbly, didn’t hug me when she saw me Etc. 
I really liked him and thought he was a really nice guy and thought maybe this might be the one, but I did notice he was a bit cold and would always follow if I veered off too far with her. I just thought it was “meeting your new gfs friends jitters” 

We met up for coffee yesterday for my birthday lunch and I told her noticed the change in her that night, she told me that her new boyfriend found out that we had slept together, and he considers me an ex and wants her to cut me out of her life. When she refused, they made rules around me so that their relationship can work. 

Rules: 
She’s not allowed to link arms with me while we walk 

We cannot be alone together so only group outings with the bf/ my husband 

No overnight trips (she was going to take me to the spa for my birthday, which would have been an overnight trip next weekend) 

I’m devastated.

My husband knows about that night, he didn’t care and when we got together, all three of us hung out all the time. But I understand that not everyone has the same views. 

Is this fixable? Should I give the relationship space and pull back? Even in a group setting, she wasn’t really herself with me. I feel like I’m ruining a chance of a good relationship for her.

1o19fov,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1o19fov/should_i_leave_my_job/,Should I leave my job?,"Throw Away Account.

I have been in this company for the last 4 years; joined as a fresh PhD in a very niche area of the country and a newly developing sector. My training is exactly in the same domain due to Engineering (bachelors), policy planning (masters) and specific science (PhD). Given this background, I still had to read a lot and train a lot to be good at what I am doing here. But it is clear that the conglomerate I work for, has taken notice. Since the second year of my job, everyone recognised the progress in the area and the giants had taken decades to reach here.

Due to my dedication, capacity to learn and implement, my team grew from 2 people reporting to me to 4 regular employees in my team at Present. I report to CXO and present to the Board Committee on quarterly basis. The background is important.

I regularly employ near PhD to join the company, work for a project or two and then hire others. However, this time, let's call her A, she wanted to stay longer and she has been in the company for 1.5 years. We share an alma matter, as my boss asked for recommendations from time and again. Over this 1.5 years of her stay at the company, we grew closer. My house was getting renovated and I crashed at her apartment for those 15 days. So, yes!! We are close. However, even though we are close, my boundaries are very clear. I tell her what I want to tell her. She used to ask me what happened in my meetings with my boss, but I discouraged her and she stopped. I have privileged information and I respect it too much to divulge anything to anyone unless necessary.

Background on my boss (Let's call him X): he has been an HR person, however extremely non-confrontational. I have had three different negotiations about my position and salary in the company and he made sure to make it as unpleasant as possible and shared on multiple occasions that I take it or leave his offer, despite me showing work. His disconnect between work output and compensation has been a very clear strategy in my experience with me and others as well. On the work side, we have had multiple discussions to convince him why something is REQUIRED for the company, whereas he wasn't convinced because somebody told him otherwise. Somebody being some random person he keeps interacting outside work.

During one project, I wanted a brilliant PhD student from my alma mater to do something very specific and get paid for a short while (PhD drama and payment issues from Universities). He joined the organization and one ride to the institute with X convinced this brilliant guy that whatever he is doing is useless. I had to beg the new guy to work on the project and provide me scientific insights. Within 3 months, the Board, the External Advisors and Auditors appreciated the work and progress made so far. X had the audacity to say, ""YOU CAN GIVE THAT CREDIT TO ME"". I was baffled and my jaw dropped in that room.

I have been thriving despite these roadblocks because I know my work and I have clarity more than he can imagine. I have my own priority list of work and I am building my career. However, I am really questioning my decisions now and getting frustrated by the minute.

Now, to the situation why I am feeling stuck and want to leave. About 6 months ago, I hire another  PhD student from a local university. Let's call her B. It's a tradition in my team, I take everyone for a team lunch whenever a new person joins. I was happy to have the second PhD join in my team, so we are three with such high qualification. As long as I was there, we talked about her personal life. The moment I left, she started asking about the gossips, who is THE BOSS in the office.

A little background of the other two people of my team, one is on maternity leave and my First Ever Hire (FEH) is special to me. She is also from my alma mater and she worked with the same Prof. I did, but the timelines were different. So FEH is special to me. I considered her friend and shared all my personal life details and we used to hangout as well. However, since I got close to A due to the stay together I realised that FEH is a gossip mouth and doesn't appreciate me.

Another side note: last year FEH was completing 2 years in the company. For the company it is a policy to promote them if their performance has been satisfactory. I had a chat with FEH that I will promote you for your good work in 1.5 years of you joining the company. I told the same to the HR who will be handling the situation. After about 3 weeks of the recommendation, I follow up on the same with the HR department, this time with a little more senior person. They suggested to check with my Boss X. X is super busy and he has cancelled my 121 with him indefinitely, I had no way of communicating this with him. Within next 2 months, FEH's attitude changes. She starts coming late to office and works on only emergency situations. I have a chat with her and she tells me she feels under appreciated. I understand and I check with my boss. He suggests that they cannot promote her due to her not finishing 2 years. I checked and it was 18 days less and suggested to make an exception. Her work has been exceptional and she is already hired at lower cost. I had a feeling that she would leave if she didn't get the promotion, and I said the same to my boss. He said, ""they cannot make exceptions like that and if she expects, she can leave. Not my problem, I have many people in the company to take care of."" I was so sad to hear that. But somehow managed to get her promoted.

In the meantime, I was depressed and was under intense therapy and lots of medication for the same. My personal life was a mess. I had spoken to my boss X about it and he had been supportive. So, I was just counting my blessings.

In no time, FEH was promoted, however, I saw changes in her. She had reduced her productivity, working on weekends despite not required to, it wasn't about work requiring such exceptions. She started arriving at the office around 11 AM. Once at office, she would take breakfast break until 12 PM and then start her work. I observed and I sent team emails about being particular about timings. But every other day, she will text me personally saying she is running late. In our office, all the entries are biometric and there is an HR system that traks it, but there are no consequences. My boss has not given us any direction on the same; however, I know from other teams that they have been given clear directions. This is on my BOSS, I know that and I cannot help it.

Now, when B asked that who's the boss, FEH was very happy to give all the gossips. Within 3 weeks time of B joining, I got very busy. I told her that we need her expertise in the area to be implemented at the company. Exactly doing her PhD work. But before she starts that, she can read about the work we have done so far in 4 years that I have been here, I have 3-4 documents that I give everyone to study. I also take orientation, however, this particular time, I was too busy to sit personally and asked the other two members of the team to provide the orientation. I asked from time to time if she had any questions and she kept saying no. I also took her for coffee on couple of occasions and walks whenever I felt like she needed a little bit of boost. However, I saw her being close to FEH so much.

On the floor, I sat a little far from the team, however, I heard FEH on multiple occasions berating me. Telling me that I am not a boss, she used ASS words for me in front of the entire floor on multiple occasions. However, I wasn't sure it was about me, so I didn't do anything. i only overheard her. I cautioned about this to my Boss though.

Now, to the chat on 3rd week of B joining. B comes to me and says that she wants feedback on her performance. I laughed and said, right now I don't have any feedback, I expect that you learn for now and as you start performing, I will give you feedback. I explained to her that how academics is so different, learn the corporate ways and you will get the hang of the system soon. She seemed to understand that.

During the same week, I get called by HR and they say B has tried to get an appointment with my Boss, X. They have heard B talk to many people in the team about not getting clear direction from me and being unsatisfactory guidance from me. I take her out for a walk and ask her why is she going to talk to my Boss, without me? She said there is some joining-related issue that she wanted to discuss with him. I said, nothing doing, there are so and so people to help you on this particular aspect. However, I believe in her word and report back to HR about the same.

She requests for a WFH for 3 weeks at the 2nd month of work. I approve the same as I understand her housing situation. She comes back and I start taking her with me to lunch breaks. It is now, A, B and one other intern in my team, we all go for a lunch. B is completely silent during the lunch and only observes. i feel uncomfortable, yet A gives me her theory that she is reporting the talks back to FEH. I don't buy that, but within a few days I see FEH and B spending hours in their evening tea time. I am pissed by this time that FEH is coming later and later, taking 1 hour breakfast break, 2 hours lunch break and then again evening snack break. i have too much work to allow that but I am not sure how to approach her. As she always has reasons and arguments for every time I have told her to come on time. or finish a project on the deadline.

I start distancing myself from B, I don't want her in my personal space. So I start spending more of my free time with A. My every moment is being observed now, but I had no idea. I go for a few days off during these days as my mental health was taking priority. HR tells A about the entire incident with B wanting to talk to X. I was pissed with HR for blabbering this; yet now the HR added, they don't believe B's motivation was so innocent as she told me. This time it hit me, maybe it was about them wanting to complaint about me. I got pissed with B and I didn't know how to handle, so I just observed and started creating safe space for me. I started going for long walks alone and distanced myself from everyone. Now, I am not sure about what is real and what is not.

In one week of me distancing myself from everyone, B asked for a group meeting. I have a larger space at my desk so, I ask her to join from my desk, while FEH was WFH. B refused. We were like, OK. After our work discussion is over, I ask if anything else is pending. B jumps up to say that she feels I am biased and not a good boss. I take sides with A and give her the best projects. Others are treated as second class citizens. I asked what do you expect me to do differently. I want to do better, I am underconfident at this point in time as this is my first time managing people and I have hard time delegating work. She says, you do not provide agenda of the meetings before hand and we cannot contribute. I said, fair enough, I will work on it. But if I do forget it, please come to me and ask for the same. If you want more work, you can come and ask me how can you help and I will try to accommodate the same. I was struggling at this point in time with communication, so I suggested the same. I could have answered better and may have done a good job of communication, but this was in-case I forget, you can approach me. She started accusing me, ""This is NOT how LEADERS behave. You are not a good leader. You SHOULD make an effort to make an inclusive team. Your team dynamics is not well and you are not encouraging us to come together"". At this point I laughed as in my therapy, we had discussed the impact of SHOULD on me from my childhood and how that has destroyed me.

Yet, I maintain my composure and I tell her that all of you are adults and I am not a teacher that I can bring you all together and ask you to make amends. She still kept arguing with me and told me about my leadership being bad. I zoned out after a while. The other two FEH and pregnant lady accused me that I give all the ""Cream"" projects to A and they are left to deal with not cream projects. I again laughed as I had just taken them to the drawing board and asked what next do they want to take up. They had taken much challenging projects, but hadn't started working on them. And I pointed it out. You chose not to work on it, but we have to get the work done somehow, right?

No answer.

The voices were high from them, someone was crying and I was laughing as I was detaching myself from the situation emotionally to protect myself. 45 minutes went by. They kept accusing me of various things, like I don't provide equal opportunities, I am a bad boss. Someone also mentioned, I am not a boss, I am only a reporting manager. They said they want to complaint to my boss and I said go ahead, as they were already planning to do that. I had two other meetings that day. I joined them, somehow managed my composure. Took 5 mins break in-between for a walk and the entire floor had heard the conversation and started asking me what happened. I couldn't explain but just said, I am baffled.

Once the meetings were over, I pulled B aside and took her to canteen to speak with her. Now, I was angry. She had mentioned earlier that she remembers one thing from the interview that I answered. She had asked, what am I looking for in the candidate that joins my team and I had said ""integrity"". She said that it was unique and it stayed with her. So, now I am angry and I tell her that your integrity is under question. She kept pushing me to tell her why and I didn't want to address it. So I pushed back. Then I burst out with a slam on the table saying, ""you lied to me"". She went away from me scared and started calling me abusive and I asked for HR to be present. I called up HR.

By the time HR came, she went away from me and I got her water as she had started crying. I told her about the integrity part and she said it is not an integrity if you bring you brother to office. I had brought my brother to office about 6 months ago at this point in time. She is 2 months into the system, how does she know? I am just absorbing everything and unable to react anymore. She accused me that I employed my friend A by by-passing the system. In fact, everyone is from my alma mater, except her. and I recommended her to my Boss as I found her PhD area very relevantly aligned to our work.

Once HR was here, we cleared the issue at hand about her lying and after she laid out the facts. She asked to check with one other colleague about B lying, but I never did that. And I apologised saying it was a misunderstanding and I would like to apologise. Again, She kept asking me for feedback. I told her that you haven't opened the data that I have shared with you and she says now you are telling me, when I am asking in front of the HR. You couldn't say this before. It was like, she kept pushing my buttons and if I blabbered a word, she would take it against me.

I apologised to her again to get it all over with. It was getting late and I was growing frustrated by now.

I called up FEH and asked for the issue at hand. She again said I favour A over everyone in the team. I had very little say in the matter until now and I had to be fair especially because a new person had joined. Just because I spend my personal time with A doesn't mean I was favoring anyone. I have my boundaries and I explained that to everyone, at all points in time, including to HR.

I went on a 2 week break right after that Friday and I had no chance of meeting my boss; however, I wanted to report such cornering. So, I made a document laying out the same and sent it to him personally. I heard during those 2 weeks that B had spoken to X directly and something was up. I come back and first thing I want to meet my boss. I go up to him and ask about the situation. He says, he has had a chat with B and FEH and assigned some work to them. Now, this work is what he briefed me and I am to take her progress and reporting. I said all ok and left. In a meeting the same day with everyone, he says that B has done some amazing work and we should all read her work. I was shocked and a little doubtful, but I played along. Soon, he started talking more and more about HER work. In fact, I got to know that she has given him one of her research articles to review and learn from. I skimmed through the article and it was an opinion piece, where she had taken 12 interviews and summarised them only qualitatively. There was zero quantification, which would have given more insights. I saw Quotations from the people, appalling in research articles.

I again went into observation mode. By this time, I started maintaining my distance and expected the same from them. And that worked out. Soon, they started becoming “normal” with me, like nothing had happened. During one Monday meeting, B showed some work that she had refused to show me on Friday and said that she had worked during the weekend. I was shocked, so, I took up a meeting with her to understand the work in detail. I did my own reading on the scientific understanding and figured there are two was of calculating one particular thing. However, depending on the context you chose a particular methodology. I ask her the same question. She says, she doesn’t know. It is the only output of her PhD and she doesn’t know.

I started doubting her credibility and started looking into her background. She is yet to defend her PhD and at most places, she has maintained her name, but in the description she has written PhD in so and so subject. It implies a finished PhD, which is not the case. In Google Scholar, she has also put Dr. B as her name. Again an ethical issue. Some more digging and I see her research papers are single author or maximum two authors, with minimum scientific rigor. I have a document listing all these things out with me. Yet, I was waiting for a chance to say something.

Her LinkedIn profile shows that she is taking money for personal consultation on career guidance. And that would cost 1.5 USD for 15 minutes and then 10-15 USD. It is a lot of money from the country I am in, especially for students. My company doesn’t allow any passive incomes externally. It is written as the contract we sign while getting employed. This information is still safe with me. I haven’t used it at all.

I give one more chance to B to share scientific accuracy of work. She shows me websites definition of the terms I had asked. Not international journals, not some standards, random website definitions. I ask her for the main source and she comes out and says, “I don’t know these concepts. I should know about them.” I was baffled, how can you use them without knowing? Didn’t your supervisor ask you about them? She said, “No”. I told her about my journey and how even a single word was not allowed if we didn’t know about the depth of it and how I was grilled by the committee for report formatting not as per the university standards. He literally tore it down and thrashed me. I still tell her that it is ok, we will learn about the concepts together. I know, I am too sweet.

I was out during this meeting, I come back to office and take a lunch meeting with my boss. I report to him that I don’t believe in a single word that comes out of her mouth. And that I had never seen such low rigor of PhD training. He tells me, I am a better judge of the rigor and that I would be responsible for each number that she puts forward. I said, “in this case, you need to establish the boundary clearly.” He said, OK.

It has been 2 months of things going relatively smoothly. She is finally taking me into consideration. She still works on magical weekends and turns up with full work on Monday without me having reviewed it. She arranges random meetings with random external partners without my knowledge. And she also undermines my authority in various other ways. I am observing her work and only commenting on the work as that is the priority for me. I don’t have much ego to think she is defying me.

There is a final straw that has broken today!

I was planning to have a 6 monthly review meeting with B today, as I have gathered my thoughts and I want her to finally start performing, which she hasn’t. So, it was my time to be with her, align the strategy and give genuine feedback on the work. But nothing goes as planned.

Today morning, I hear from B that X has called for 10 minutes today. I am completely surprised that they are in touch, without me in between. They communicate on mobile phones and he calls her directly. I am enraged and unable to understand what to do. I feel like quitting.

TLDR: My Team complaints to my Boss about me and My Boss encourages one of the team members by contacting them without keeping me in the loop. Should I quit my job?",1,1759927436.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

|**Ledger Footnote (Elias):** July 28 — August 22, 1885. Curtis brings assays and jars; the county promises review; counsel fractures under offers and fear. Surveyors mark the rail’s approach. Mrs. Gleaner funds mitigation and designs a parlor. Private showings begin. Josiah’s influence coalesces. A man does not return. Curtis and I prepare a conservative sealing of the Odessa Shaft. The choices that follow are small, quotidian, and ruinous in ways paper cannot fully explain. E. Thatcher|

A ledger gives dates and sums; memory gives the smell of dust on curtains and the small brittle sounds of men altering their consciences. This chapter is rendered in sections so each scene can live and breathe on its own: voices, measures, the seam’s small attentions, and the people who tried to put numbers between it and the rest of us. Mr. Curtis is at my shoulder throughout—measured, furious, and quietly moral. Mrs. Joy Gleaner will interrupt when she must, because she always will.





# I — The Council Room: Proof and the Quiet of Evidence

The council chamber smelled of coffee that had been reheated twice and of the varnish left over from the mayor’s last attempt at civic dignity. The long table wore ink stains like small medals of service. They set the jars in a line along that table, each one wrapped and tagged, like sleepy captive things. Curtis had the posture of a schoolmaster forced into law: steady hands, a voice that measures rather than commands.

He laid out the magnetometer folio with the care one shows a map of an enemy. The black spikes rose and fell like teeth. He set the phonograph in the center and closed the case as if locking a confession.

Curtis: (soft, precise) “Magnetic anomalies concentrated within thirty meters of the headframe. Fe ions elevated in near-field water. Organometallic traces we do not expect from our ore profiles. Acoustic captures consistently reproduce fragments of human speech—names, phrases—adaptively.”

He wound the crank. The needle dragged; the wax coughed; a small voice—half-breath, half-echo—threaded through the hiss: a child’s name.

Harris’s hand trembled as if the sound had been a rebuke. “It said ‘Tommy’,” he breathed. “Like my mam when I was small.”

Amos Tull—who kept accounts like prayers—closed his fingers around a ledger. “If you close the shaft the pump dies. Men go. Bread stops. Who pays for the parish then?”

Curtis laid a jar forward until the lamplight caught a strange bloom in the water. “I ask for a moratorium on exhibitions. Independent verification. If the town continues to show the drift, you expose visitors to a demonstrable phenomenon.”

The mayor, Hargrove, thumbed the edge of a receipt and then glanced toward the doorway as if expecting a deus ex machina. The door opened like a stage cue and Mrs. Joy Gleaner stepped in: silk, hat, a practical smile, and the air of someone with funds and the habit of telling people what should be done.

||
||
|*(Mrs. Joy Gleaner — aside.)* “You will forgive me if I speak plainly,” she said to the room and, with that same small insolence, to you reading this later. “Towns do not survive on caution alone. They survive when someone pays for the pump. I will underwrite independent assays and an infirmary. Call it influence if the word comforts you; I call it underwriting civilization.”|

Her cheque slid onto the table with the soft authority of currency. The clerk stamped Curtis’s packet: *representative to inspect in due course.* In Calico, “due course” is a polite way to say: someone else’s calendar will be asked to act while we feed ourselves.

Curtis wound the phonograph again. The wax made the same cough and offered another name like a coin placed on an account. The room felt smaller, the stakes more present.

Elias: (writing) *Assays documented. Request for moratorium. Mrs. Gleaner offers funding. County to inspect in due course.*

The council’s decision—what to do with evidence and appetite—would be written and re-written in the ledger many times over. But at that table the choices were still raw: a jar, a cheque, a whisper of a name.





# II — The Mayor’s Parlor: Drafts, Piles, and the Architecture of Compromise

The mayor’s parlor smelled of lemon oil and the quiet rustle of paper plans. Langford spread his charcoal sketches over the cloth like vows. The plan framed the headframe at a polite distance: a veranda curved to offer the view without the temptation of approach, a parlor for tea, a conservatory, twenty rooms to begin.

Mrs. Gleaner outlined the program as if enumerating the features of a fine life. “Guided tours at set hours,” she said. “Uniforms for guides; a physician on call; a small infirmary; weekly assay postings in the vestibule; no ad hoc showings; a fund from ticket sales for the pump.”

Langford: (pencil hovering) “Piles; deep foundations; a plenum to ventilate under-floor air; separate cistern for cooking water. Doing this right changes the cost.”

Curtis placed his magnetometer folio on the charcoal and drew a few lines with his finger. “Drive piles to the depth where readings return to baseline,” he said. “Monitoring wells at the corners and center. Exhaust plenum with dampers. Antechamber for anyone experiencing disorientation. No basements where ground runoff can collect.”

Langford hesitated, then re-drew. The cost of conscience was there in graphite—clear, linear, unafraid of arithmetic.

Mrs. Gleaner laughed as if at a private joke. “I will underwrite the piles and the initial monitoring,” she said. “I will require the brochure to read ‘Restored with care — Independent monitoring.’”

||
||
|*(Mrs. Joy Gleaner — aside.)* “Type sells confidence,” she told the architect and you. “Put ‘independent assays’ in a tasteful line and people will pay to be properly frightened. A neat brochure is the hand that steadies the purse.”|

Langford reconfigured his elevations, and the parlor took the shape of a mitigation: woodwork and policy braided together. The town would now sell a measured terror with a cup of good tea and a posted magnetometer strip.





# III — The Surveyors: Iron, Theodolites, and a Needle That Sang

Harlow’s survey party arrived with tripods and chains, tools that made the town feel connected to a world of schedules and freight. They set stakes and a theodolite near the headframe. The needle twitched, then wavered. It refused to sit above a stake placed too near the lip. Harlow moved it a few paces and the instrument steadied.

Harlow: (practical) “Magnetic interference. Mark a cautionary band. We’ll route the spur to the north and adjust ballast.”

The prospect of a rail spur tightened the town’s tolerance for risk. With the rail came wages and an easier way to ship timber and linens. The theodolite’s wobble was geology and a warning rolled into one; men read omens into physics if they wished. Langford smiled at the new cost and translated it into line-items for his bills.

Elias recorded the coordinates where the instrument balked. Curtis made a note in the margin of his folio. The town now moved between two concrete things: the seam below and the iron that wanted to pass by.





# IV — The Saloon: Folklore, Wagers, and the Old Men’s Arithmetic

The saloon is a place where a town’s future is argued in quarter-measure and betting slips. Old Tom, the Cornishman, told the assembly of knockers—small, domestic spirits of old mines who appreciate rhythm and respect. He advocated pebble offerings and a certain gentle trick of leaving a coin in a pocket.

Old Tom: “Leave a token. Keep the rhythm. Teach the seam to take small things.”

Señor Vasquez lit a candle at the assay office window. A woman sewed a coin into her son’s shirt. Rituals old as the hills folded into new arrangements: a curated relic case in the parlor to redirect offerings into the pump fund. Science stood beside ceremony now, not to displace it but to bureaucratize it.

Curtis watched from the end of a bench, ledger open. He listened as men justified appetite and explained away conscience with arithmetic.

Curtis: (soft) “They’ll rationalize it. Money will soothe conscience, and the ledger will eat the names we do not want to remember.”

Elias: (noting) *Town knitting old practices to new policy. Ritual becomes municipal revenue.*

These small domestic actions were the bones of compromise—folk caution made into civic practice.





# V — The First Private Showing: The Cage and the Missing Man

They performed the first private descent at dusk. The businessman—a neat man in a watch-chain—stepped into the cage with an air of confident amusement; Josiah supervised the hoist with the care of a man who relished the authority he had recently obtained. The cage descended with the soft sound of the throat swallowing breath.

Down in the drift the lamps were small moons; timber took on the color of memory. The cage should have been hoisted back with the same party it had lowered. Instead it surfaced with a smaller burden. Gloves lay on the lip like abandoned sentences; a cane lay on the boards like a last punctuation.

Josiah’s voice, steady as a ledger, announced it: “He took more than his ticket allowed.”

Curtis played the spool for the council. The wax coughed, offered a knock, a name, then a reply—one clean syllable: “more.” Then silence like a page cut off mid-sentence. The businessman’s son went white; some men averted their faces.

Investor’s son: “That’s father’s voice at the start.”

Josiah: “He sought more.”

Elias: (writing) *Private show results: imperative reply; disappearance. Establish fund; demand moratorium.*

The town made a fund and, quietly, a market for private entry reformed into a market for early access: “associates,” men willing to pay for the prestige of seeing first. The missing man’s chair remained at the inn; his bills piled on his table like evidence of a life interrupted. The seam had taken price; the town began auctioning hazard.

||
||
|*(Mrs. Joy Gleaner — aside.)* “I funded assays and the infirmary,” she said softly when asked. “If you must choose a villain, choose me and be dramatic. If you want a benefactor, do me that courtesy. Either way—buy curtains. They make the room look finished.”|

She smiled, wrote another entry in her own book, and the council wrote checks to the same tune.





# VI — The County’s Pace and the Town’s Shorter Deadlines

Curtis drove the jars and the spool to the county seat and returned with stamped receipts and the phrase *due course*—the law’s promise to do something in time. The county representative insisted on a formal petition from the council before he would exercise the powers to mandate closure.

The council split. Some men, with bread on their minds, said: let the sales continue. Others, with children in the room at home, said: caution. Money moved to the center of argument. Mrs. Gleaner offered an expedited assay fund; the county clerk accepted the fees and wrote a date into his docket. The town took the county’s lenient nod as provisional permission.

Curtis cursed the bureaucracy. “Paper is a covering,” he told Elias. “They file it and sleep. Action is what keeps men alive tonight.”

Elias: (quiet) *When the law moves slow, men move faster to feed themselves.*

Private lists filled. Men who had been reluctant now bought seats. The seam, patient and practiced, was fed by human eagerness. The council’s prodigious moral job became a matter of receipts and signatures more often than of sermons.





# VII — Josiah’s Consolidation: Rules, Rosters, Authority

Josiah’s power was incremental. He enforced rosters and rules—two men per descent, witnesses, no souvenirs. People deferred because a man who can make rules is a man who has found purchase. Josiah spoke the language of order and numbers. Men signed his lists because they feared the alternative.

Josiah: (firm) “Two per cage. Witnesses sign. No mementos.”

He did not preach; he administered. The town liked that. There is a comfort in rules—structured danger is easier to swallow than ungoverned risk. Curtis demanded presence of public witnesses and a posted assay before any showing. Josiah acquiesced in the letter where he could, and the town's calm thickened.





# VIII — The Arithmetic of Complicity

The missing man became an entry in the ledger and a fund for condolences. “Associates” paid for early showings. Men with appetite for prestige were given curated tours. The moral calculus narrowed: feed the living today, count on conscience tomorrow. Curtis insisted on transparency—assays published before any showing; independent witnesses present; strict no-souvenir policy. Some signed the pledge. Others inked the blank spaces with the same hand that writes “later.”

Mrs. Gleaner used the parlor as a vehicle to re-channel offerings: glass cases for relics, donation boxes to fund the pump. The old rituals were repurposed into municipal charity.

||
||
|*(Mrs. Joy Gleaner — aside.)* “If you want to be pure, buy your bread and write the sermon later,” she said, folding a cheque. “I prefer being useful.”|





# IX — Curtis’s Protocol: Instruments as a Form of Mercy

Curtis codified an ethic into procedure. Magnetometer sweeps occurred twice daily on radial lines; monitoring wells were placed at corners and center; water assays ran weekly; brass tags were fixed to timbers to detect nudges; microcamera housings were buried and then re-buried after dust and battery life proved fickle. He required an antechamber at the view point, a physician on-call, and a public posting board where weekly numbers were pinned.

Curtis: (calmly) “Record everything. Witness everything. Publish. If men must be kept close to the drift, they will be witnessed. Evidence is a deterrent.”

When a brass disc was nudged and an audio spike coincided on the spool, Curtis interpreted it as evidence of a field that answered attention. He refused to use the spool as a spectacle. He would play it for the county man and for witnesses, not for entertainment.

Elias: (noting) *Curtis turned priest of numbers and guardian of witnesses.*

Curtis’s persistence gave the town a framework: evidence, witness, and public posting. It did not remove appetite, but it created a paper trail.





# X — The Town’s Small Abnormalities

The seam’s effects spread into little domestic irregularities rather than grand melodrama: the mill sounded an odd bell-tone at dusk and then ceased; eggs arrived with lace-like cracking and were shelved as curios; three clocks stopped at the same minute one afternoon; a newborn calf bore a pale badge of white on its flank. Children dreamed doors that asked questions and woke with names on their tongues. Mothers sewed coins in hems, and old Tom’s pebble practice became municipal: a small pebble box collected in the parlor and turned into a fund.

Curtis recorded each of these minor anomalies with the arithmetician's care that had become his religion: date, witness, reading. The town treated folk measures and scientific measures as complementary protections—prayer and protocol both in the same toolkit.

Elias: (soft) *In ordinary life the seam left traces like a child's hand on a window—small smudges that would not wash away.*





# XI — The Plan to Seal: Surgical Precision

When the county’s pace and the private showings threatened to cost more lives, Curtis and I designed a surgical plan: to collapse the throat behind the first door with enough controlled material to jam the aperture but not enough to destroy the headframe. Timers, wedges, packed blocks and timber—calculated to choke rather than to tear the ridge.

We rehearsed rope-work with men who had no interest in spectacle: Harris, Murphy, Miguel, Owen. We chose witnesses who would not profit: the preacher, a surgeon from the next town, and a county clerk who had been persuaded by Mrs. Gleaner’s fees to attend as a courteous observer.

Curtis: (measured) “We act with witnesses and measurements. No souvenirs. We will document everything so law sees intent to preserve life, not to profit.”

Elias: (signing) *I sign the witness list and the coordinates. I feel the ink is heavier than the pen ought to be.*

The plan was a surgeon’s list of incisions, each step an attempt to close a wound without killing the patient.





# XII — The Night Before: Confessions and Quiet Preparations

The town slept thinly. Lamps burned at porches. Women stitched coins into hems. Josiah came to the assay office with his cap in hand and the look of a man who had paid for a roof and accepted the cost.

Josiah: (low) “If I sinned, it was to keep my children's plates full.”

Elias: (plain) “You bought bread. That makes a bargain you will keep. It does not erase consequence.”

Curtis checked the magnetometer and handed a folded packet to me: coordinates, charges’ order, witness roster. We read the list like a prayer—names in one column, signatures in another. Mrs. Gleaner put an envelope on the desk: *Sign the ledger honestly. I will keep my receipts.* She clasped my wrist like a contract.

||
||
|*(Mrs. Joy Gleaner — aside.)* “A woman pays to keep a town from emptying,” she said. “I prefer necessity to purity.”|

Her declaration was as practical as a check; she arranged curtains in her head even in the dim.





# XIII — The Sealing: Timers, Dust, and One Last Name

At dawn we met at the headframe. The county clerk observed with his neat notepad but would not order closure; his presence was documentation, not command. Langford checked beams; Curtis ran a final magnetometer sweep. Fuses were placed; wedges readied. Men moved like watchful craftsmen, their faces carved by the knowledge of what they must do.

The charges fired with the dry crack of stone settling: a cough, not an explosion. Rock slid, timber groaned, dust climbed to a pale cloud and hung like a thing that wanted to be witnessed. For a breath the seam answered as if some old habit of taking names had not yet been taught to accept packing. A nickname—Murphy’s father’s name—spoke clearly in that moment and Murphy found his knees wanting to walk. He braced and did not move.

Miguel swore later that in a gap of falling stone he saw a pale silhouette like his abuela smiling at him; whether that was mercy or a trick of light and terror I cannot say. Men hammered wedges until the throat would not breathe without extraordinary persuasion.

Curtis read the magnetometer: the spikes diminished. The spool, later, coughed only an almost-speech, like someone who had lost the vocabulary of demand and now kept only rhythm. We signed the witness list with hands still capable of labor.

Elias: (writing) *Sealed throat with witness signatures. Magnetometer trending down. Post weekly assays.*





# XIV — Aftermath: Relief, Recriminations, and Redesign

They dined at small tables that night with a softer appetite. For a time water tasted less like blood, children slept with steadier lungs, and the mill sang a less weird note. Investors grumbled about delays and raised the polite threat of suits. Langford drew deeper piles and cross-braces. Mrs. Gleaner issued another cheque for additional piers and a bigger plenum that pushed air away from the lip at the precise angle Curtis requested.

The county filed our witness lists and assays. Law, slow and deliberate, would later measure intent and outcome; for now it marked compliance. Curtis kept posting weekly numbers. The parlor’s vestibule gained a public posting board where magnetometer strips and water assay numbers hung like a civic prayer.

In the tavern some men called us saviors; others called us cowards—compromisers who bought a town’s sustenance while sacrificing a purer moral stand. The ledger recorded both accusation and thanks in equal ink; it made no judgment.

||
||
|*(Mrs. Joy Gleaner — aside.)* “You will remember me kindly or villainously,” she said while smoothing a new set of curtains. “I prefer to be necessary. Curtains and pumps both require funding.”|





# XV — Reckoning and the Ledger That Remains

Time tempered the sharpness of the sealing into a long watchfulness. The seam did not die. It patiented; it shifted its appetite from name-calls to low rhythms and murmurings. Curtis’s later cylinders—recorded in anechoic tents and private runs—showed counting-like rhythms and low tonal material but rarely clear names. Stimulus, he concluded, breeds specificity. Starve attention, and the calls lose their hooks.

The town adjusted. Langford’s piles held. The parlor rose on deeper timbers; the railroad delivered freights twice a week; children apprenticed in the linen rooms. The ledger sat on my desk like a book that refused to forget. I kept it clean and precise as a man keeps a family record.

||
||
|*(Mrs. Joy Gleaner — final aside.)* “Buy a postcard, come and sit on the veranda, tell your story,” she said, pouring tea. “Tell me as villain or savior—I’ll take either. Curtains are bought and children need shoes.”|

She folded the ledger shut and walked back into a house that had cost more than oak and nails.

**Part End Note**

The engine of prosperity rolled closer, the town buzzed like a hive newly fed, and the Gleaner House rose to shelter more than men. Yet with every plank we fastened and every spike we drove, the ledger in Curtis’s hand grew thicker, and our nights grew longer. The log of events filled with detail that refused to be explained away by superstition or ledger alike. If the town were to reopen the Odessa, we would do so with ears to the ground and eyes wide. The danger felt smaller when named; it did not feel smaller when it answered.

Next we will trace the spread: the supernatural phenomena extending into the town proper, the deeper excavation under Curtis’s watch, and the mounting friction as prosperity and dread tighten their marriage.",0,1759927199.0,creepcast,0,0.5,False

I wanted to make an attempt at dovetail joinery, though I ended up with only one dovetail on one side. This was partly due to injuring my finger with a chisel, but mostly because the second one wasn’t good at all and I did not want to restart. So, I turned it into a box shape and thankfully it worked out decently enough. 

It’s far from perfect! But I like how the contrast in colors turned out with just using danish oil and a red mahogany for the legs. 

I think one day I’ll redo this project and try to improve on it and see if I can make it look better! 

Question I have…
I cut everything up and before gluing it applied the stains and oil. I applied a poly at the very end after it was glued and assembled. Is this the “better” order of things? Or should you glue first and then stain? I think I did it the way I did it because I wanted to avoid getting the dark stain into my “platform” piece. But again not sure, I just wonder what the best process might be!

| HydroGraph Awarded New U.S. Patent for Graphene-Based Actuator Technology   *Electrothermal actuator leverages Fractal Graphene™ to deliver silent, scalable, high-force motion* HydroGraph Clean Power Inc. (CSE: HG) (OTCQB: HGRAF) (“HydroGraph” or the “Company”), a leading producer of ultra-pure graphene,  today announced that it has been granted U.S. Patent No. 12,378,948 for a novel actuator technology that uses electrically conductive porous carbon materials, including HydroGraph’s proprietary Fractal Graphene™, to generate controlled mechanical force.   This marks the first U.S. patent granted for an invention developed in HydroGraph’s laboratories, part of the Company’s strategy to expand its intellectual property portfolio beyond its foundational graphene synthesis patents licensed from Kansas State University. Additionally, HydroGraph has now 11 additional patent applications pending covering various material innovations and applications.   The patented design harnesses the fractal, highly porous structure of HydroGraph’s Fractal Graphene™ to create an electrothermal actuator. By applying a small voltage, Joule heating expands the enclosed air within the material, generating motion and force. Unlike [conventional actuators](https://hydrograph.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6b7dd96e17938b2a91960de48&id=6787ad3630&e=611f24fc42), HydroGraph’s device delivers rapid, silent, and scalable force generation. A unit the size of a finger can generate approximately one newton of force, with designs scalable to larger outputs.   [The global actuators market](https://hydrograph.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6b7dd96e17938b2a91960de48&id=910e4d30b3&e=611f24fc42) was estimated at USD 66.95 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 71.22 billion in 2025 to approximately 100.41 billion by 2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of about 7.1 percent. This steady growth highlights the expanding demand for actuator technologies that can deliver greater efficiency, lower noise, and improved adaptability across sectors including automotive, manufacturing, robotics, and consumer appliances.  “Fractal Graphene™ is unique in that its structure is more than 95 percent air, giving it an extraordinary ability to generate force when heated electrically,” said Dr. Ranjith Divigalpitiya, HydroGraph’s Chief Science Officer and co-inventor of the patent. “In effect, it is essentially electrically conducting air. This patent demonstrates how the intrinsic properties of our material can be translated into new types of actuators. While further validation and development are required, the scientific foundation laid here opens a pathway to motion technologies that are lightweight, quiet, and adaptable across scales.”  The invention has broad claims covering porous carbon materials such as carbon black, graphite, carbon nanotubes, and graphene foams. Potential applications include:   ●      HVAC and building systems: replacement for wax or PTC-based hydronic valve actuators. ●      Consumer appliances: silent, low-voltage actuators for dishwashers, coffee/steam machines, and other household goods. ●      Automotive thermal management: compact, EMI-immune actuators for EV and ICE cooling loops. ●      Microfluidics and diagnostics: lab-on-chip devices where small, fast actuators are critical. ●      Aerospace and robotics: lightweight, scalable, and silent actuation in environments where motors are impractical.   “Securing this patent is an important milestone in broadening HydroGraph’s intellectual property portfolio,” said Kjirstin Breure, CEO of HydroGraph. “While our core focus remains on the commercialization of high-purity graphene, this achievement underscores the versatility of our technology platform. Intellectual property of this nature strengthens our long-term position and provides optionality as we evaluate applications where our materials can create measurable value. We look forward to working with potential partners to explore the most suitable avenues for this innovation.”   The patent positions HydroGraph to explore development of a family of actuators ranging from cost-sensitive carbon black versions to premium graphene foam designs.  **About Hydrograph** HydroGraph is a leading producer of pristine graphene using an “explosion synthesis” process, which allows for exceptional purity, low energy use, and identical batches. The quality, performance, and consistency of Hydrograph’s graphene follow the Graphene Council’s Verified Graphene Producer® standards, of which very few graphene producers are able to meet.

I use an Baratza Encore ESP grinder and a DeLonghi Dedica espresso machine.

Over the past few days, I’ve noticed that my espresso shots are running far too fast. Here are some details that may help diagnose the issue:

1. I’m using the same roasted beans I’ve used for years. Previously, I ground them at settings between 8 and 10.
2. I’ve cleaned the Encore ESP. A small rubber part was damaged, so I replaced it with another.
3. I’m now grinding at the finest possible setting (1), even after adding shims, but the shots run fast
4. I dose 15 grams of beans per shot, as I always have.
5. I also descaled the DeLonghi Dedica today, but it didn’t make any difference.
6. The coffee beans that i am using are 10 days old

Currently, I’m getting about 44 grams of espresso in 15 seconds. Besides running too fast, the shots also splatter and create a mess.

Could this indicate that the Encore ESP is no longer grinding fine enough, or is something wrong with the DeLonghi Dedica?

by Preston Dennett

All UFO encounters are interesting, but perhaps the most fascinating is when UFOs land and humanoids come out! Here are ten cases of UFO landings from across the world including the United States, Brazil, Australia, Italy, Spain, Norway, Finland, Scotland, France and England. They span over a period of five decades. They involve a wide variety of humanoid figures. Many are multiple witness cases. Almost all of them involve some form hard evidence such as landing traces, animal reactions, electromagnetic disturbances, psychic effects and physiological reactions. Some include government involvement and even disturbing threats from apparent men in black.

JUL 23, 1947, PITANGA BRAZIL: Topographer Jose C. Higgins hears a high-pitched hum. Suddenly a metallic craft lands next to him and out come three beautiful ETs wearing weird spacesuits. Jose founds himself surrounded by them. To his relief, they appear to be friendly. Feeling fear, he retreats and watches them from a distance as they begin playing like small children.

AUG 1960, NEWCASTLE, NSW AUSTRALIA: Helen Aldridge is awakened by a buzzing noise coming from outside her home. Looking out the window, she sees a craft shaped like a toy top landing in her backyard. Out steps a humanoid dressed in an olive-green jumpsuit. To her shock, it climbs over her fence and approaches right up to her window.

JUL 31, 1966, PRESQUE ISLE STATE PARK, PA: When their car gets stuck in the sand, Gerald LaBelle goes for help, leaving behind Betty Klem, Doug Tibbets, Anita Haifley and her two children. Without warning, a UFO lands in the forest next to them. Police arrive and leave with Doug to investigate. At this point, a huge hairy humanoid emerges from the forest and attacks the car. Before long officers from Project Blue Book arrive to investigate.

AUG 29, 1967, CUSSAC, FRANCE: When 13-year-old Francois Delpeuch and his little sister Ann-Marie (age 9) go to retrieve the family cows, they come upon a huge glowing sphere and four small humanoids walking around beneath it. When they approach for a closer look, the strange beings notice the two children and begin floating one by one back into the craft.

FEB 5, 1971, KINNULA, FINLAND: Two forestry workers (Peter Aliranta and Esko Sneck) get the shock of their lives when a UFO lands next to them in the forest. A small 4-foot-tall being emerges and approaches Peter. When the being turns around to enter the craft, Peter rushes forward and grabs the ET by the foot. It’s a decision that he will regret for a long time.

NOV 14, 1976, WINCHESTER, ENGLAND: Joyce Bowles is driving home. Her friend Edwin Pratt is in the passenger seat. They are concerned to see a UFO dropping down from the sky ahead of them on the road. Suddenly their car steers itself off the road. When they finally get it to stop, they see a UFO blocking the roadway and humanoids looking out the windows at them. Then one emerges from the craft, walks right up to them and stares at them fixedly. Their strange adventure has only begun.

MAY 18, 1977, ELGIN, SCOTLAND: Karen McLennan and Fiona Morrison (both 10-years-old) are playing near their homes when they hear a soft humming noise in the woods. They go to investigate and come upon a landed craft. Standing next to it is a tall slender man dressed in a silvery jumpsuit. As the man walks towards them, the girls flee. When they turn around, they see the craft flying off. But when they get home, they learn there are more witnesses. And then the threats start coming in.

SEP 18, 1978, SAN GIORGIO DI NOGARO, ITALY: Railway employee Giorgio Filiputti only wants to enjoy a quiet day of fishing. But it’s not to be. He hears a strange noise and an odd breeze. Going to investigate, he comes upon a landed craft. A weird 4-foot-tall humanoid looks surprised to see Giorgio approach. He stares at Giorgio and begins to work on apparently repairing his craft.

NOV 24, 1978, GERENA, SPAIN: When four young men go hunting along the Guadiamar River, they get a lot more than they bargained for. Seeing strange lights in the forest, they come upon a landed UFO and a 7-foot-tall humanoid. The strange figure starts walking towards them. When it gets too close, the men run away in a panic. Later, strange land-traces are found.

JUL 25, 1981. STJORDAL, NORWAY: Hjordis Hokstad wants only to enjoy her morning coffee and watch the wild deer in the field behind her house. Instead she sees a landed UFO and a weird humanoid wearing a spacesuit walking around the craft. She grabs her binoculars and gets a nice close look. Little does she know, her neighbor is watching the whole thing from his house.

There is no more room for denial. The evidence for the reality of UFOs and extraterrestrials is here for those with the courage to examine it. We are not alone! We are only one of many different humanoids in a universe teeming with intelligent life.

Words, pictures, and sounds pour out of machines as if they had been waiting all along to speak. Every day brings more of them. They fill our screens and our minds until we no longer know where to look.



Once, a writer would labor over a page, shaping each sentence with care. Now, a machine will give you ten pages before you have finished your coffee. The words look fine at first, neat and polite, but they carry no breath, no weight of a person behind them. They are born perfect and die young.



Painters, too, have new rivals. A click of a button gives birth to faces and fields that never were. They are beautiful in their way, though they do not smell of turpentine or patience. A man once waited a week for light to fall right upon his canvas. The machine does not wait. It never doubts its own talent.



Even music comes quick now. Voices rise from nowhere, smooth and sweet, singing songs that no one wrote. They are pleasant enough, but they leave no memory behind. You cannot imagine them being sung by a tired heart.



Every craft has caught this fever. Scholars send papers into the world by the thousands, yet few will be read. Coders build endless lines of code, most of which will soon be forgotten. The air is thick with creation, but thin with care.



It is a strange age. A farmer once sowed grain, now he sows data. The harvest is rich, yet tasteless. There is no famine of words or pictures anymore, but perhaps there is a famine of meaning.



And yet, it is not all bad. The door is open wider than before. Anyone may step through it and make something. The poor man has the same tools as the rich one. The schoolchild can paint, the old woman can write, the shy one can sing. That is a kind of miracle.



Still, a question lingers. When everyone can make everything, who will stop to listen, to look, to care? The world is full, but the silence between things has grown thin.""",2,1759926214.0,ChatGPT,4,0.67,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

I exposed for approximately that amount of time.

1.  Sir Paul has it in spades.  Could do without the political messaging but whatever.  

2. Vegas is definitely a little slower.  Asked every taxi driver, cause they know everything, and all generally said they are seeing 20% less rides.  (Prices have NOT come down despite some advertising to the contrary.  Two breakfast sandwich and two coffee at Jonnie Rockets at Venitian costs $48.  Just F right off.)

3. Nobu @ Caesars.  As always it was spot on.  I maintain thier yellowtail jalepeno sushimi is best in town. Also, if the bartender suggests something off menu just get it.  

4. Peter Lugar.  I'm glad a vendor paid and not me.  Flavorless steak.  Good vibe though.  

5. Joes.  Try to go every time im in town.  (Maybe 10-12 times and a few times at Chicago and DC.) This was the first time it was a little meh.  Call me old fashioned but a deconstructed steak oscar is just steak with a couple sticks of asparagus, a pile of crab and a cup of berniese on the side.  Dumb.  But the snow crab is still perfection. 

6.  Red 8 at Wynn offers what might be the best dish I have ever had.  Last three trips I have gone for lunch and get the steamed seabass.  If I ever get the chair that's my last meal.  

7. Momofuku. The view at night straight up feels like a scene out of blade runner. We just ordered a bunch and pass it around.  Too many tasty choices.  

8.  Someone needs to put a condum on the Vanderpump breeding machine.  

9. Hardrock is going to be a very welcome addition to the increasingly bland skyline. 

10.  Now this surprised the hell out of me but Wynn smelled like smoke and only once in a while did u get a whiff of the ""Wynn"" scent.  Venitian was smokey on the floor too which I think is a first.  Enough to sting my eyes.   Cosmo had no scent at all and  I wonder if they pulled it.  The only one whose scent hit you lile it normally does was Aria.  I know the cost of pumping in the scent is up there and I wonder if they are pulling back on air handling costs.

1o18tdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o18tdb/willys_wonderstore_1/,Willy's Wonderstore (1),"Hey r/nosleep  
Posting this from the breakroom at my workplace, just call me Nate (technically Nate Jr., blame my Mum), it's around 6:30pm, probably 8pm when I'll post this, I guess it's a whole run of random thoughts for me, so things will be a bit disjointed.

To start with, I am (as of now) the ADM (Assistant Department Manager) of the Front End of Willy's Wonderstore, a local branch of supermarkets in my home state of Queensland. (Yes, I'm Aussie.)  
Used to work for the bigger chains when I was around 14, quickly realised all the big claims of ""Family"" were manipulative tactics by the time I had my first drink at 16. (Best night of my life, if I'm honest, gotta miss the days of high school sometimes... even if my friends and I broke the law.)  
Shortly after that, I was without a job, home was a mess, mum couldn't handle all the stress alone, sending me to school and working a 7 day job, so I had to find a new job for myself, real quick, without the issue of corporate manipulation looming over my shoulder.

That's where Willy's Wonderstore came in, it was a local brand, reputable, small. Living in a low income house with my widowed mum, I of course jumped at the chance to work for them, skip forward a whole 7 years and I'm a scruffy 23yr old employee who still hasn't climbed the corporate ladder. Pay's good, mum was able to quit her shitty job, since I was able to pay off the debts she'd racked up after dad left us and this world.

Only reason I explain this, is so that you know why I can't just hand in my two weeks and quit.

But that's enough of me, I should explain why I am posting this and asking for your advice and help. I started my ADM position about 2 months back, around the time our PDM Rebbeca was in her third trimester and forced to go on maternity leave. Woman had to be told by the store managed to go on leave, or he'd fire her, she loved the Front End, meeting people, but I could not imagine the strain she must have been in, hence why she was forced to take time off.

So, with her being put on limited time and me being added as her second in command, I was trained and then given the expectation to take over from her for the time she's gone (I doubt it's a short time, her husband was an amputee, real bad car crash, so he was wheelchair bound. Great guy though, killer stories about his time in the air force. So taking care of a baby is gonna run them both ragged), which included doing one of the strangest tasks you could think a check-out worker would have to do- opening and closing the store at night.

Willy's operates on a more lax schedule, we open at 10am sharp, every morning, close at 6pm, regardless of weekday or weekend (on holidays we stay open until 9pm.). But then, we open back up at 11pm until 4am every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The Manager calls it 'Graveyard Trading Hours', payrates are doubled and it's a pretty sweet deal. At least, that's what I was thinking, at first.

Part of Rebbeca's duties was starting at 12pm and at the end of the shift, having us close up at 6pm and then returning at 11pm to open up again, with the now ex ADM, Kyle, closing at 4am. Only reason she was needed was to verify headcount, so that no one was trying to pretend to be a member of staff, or sneak in a shift on the rather gullible shift system for a quick and easy buck at double the rate.

Me, though, I fulfil both their roles, I arrive at work at 11:50am sharp and then clock in at 11:54am. I just find the early start helps me figure out what the day is going to be like, what stock is on hand, the usual.

I work on front end, keep the staff members in line, sell liquor and other 18+ stuff to the occasional customer, usually met with grunts and growls about the need for ID, the average crap that you get being on the main counter. After that, around closing time (5:30pm), we take out the trash from any of the registers, if you work in retail, you know the drill, send one of the juniors off with the trash bags to chuck them into the dumpster out back near the loading bay.

Then, I take my copy of the store keys and bring down the roller doors, leaving only the one next to the express register open so the nightfill team can herd any confused customers out (usually the elderly who can't really tell the time while in a grocery store) through it. Once all the customers are gone, I close the last roller door, say goodnight to the nightfill ADM, Sarah and let the Front End team out through the exit door on the dock. By the end of that, it is usually 6:10pm, then I have to perform a 20 minute double take on our store's security footage, for anything that comes up on the security cameras. (They have a program on them that puts a highlight on anything that does not line up at the Front End.)

Trawling through hazy freezeframes, I have to label them under different categories, whether they are considered to be of concern, a scan that didn't go through or even shoplifting an item. Half the time it's just the camera bugging out because someone bought something from somewhere else and has it in their trolley.

By 6:30pm, I save all the categories into a folder for the Store Manager, David, to look through when he opens in the morning at 10am. I then stay back until 7pm, having to check through my team's statistics (contract hours, any duty limitations, workplace notices on behaviour.)

Now, due to my task as ADM, on any of the days we don't have the bizarre night trading hours, it's just a simple 7hr shift, I come in just before 12, finish at 7 and go home to my mum and our black cat, Coal.  
But for Monday, Wednesday and Friday, the schedule changes, come in early, keep the team in check, work until 6, then close the roller doors and let the team out. But instead of staying back, I myself have to leave at 6pm too, as I am expected to return in 5hrs to reopen the store.

What I do, on those nights, is that I will head home (a good 25 minute walk to our quaint family home) and take a 3hr power nap, usually with Coal laying his plump, fuzzy mass on top of my neck like a scarf. Mum then will wake me up, as she is about to go to bed, usually scooping up the pudgy black cat as she goes and I will take a quick hot shower and swap my work hat and shirt, to feel fresh. Then I walk back to work, usually grabbing a small bite to eat on the way from one of the local fast food places on the route to Willy's.

By the time I am back at Willy's Wonderstore, the nightfill team will be packing up and heading home, with Sarah and I inverting our farewell, where I wave goodbye to her, instead of her doing so. I will note that I am not alone, during this time, as I am accompanied by team members from what David calls ""The Graveyard Shift"", they don't talk much, mostly keep to themselves and seem to focus solely on scanning items, droning out responses and packing bags. I can understand the feeling, though, they are having to do night shift and check-out work, it's not too fun to combine too rather dreary tasks into one.

The customers we get at night aren't the worst, as we live in a decently small country town, mostly stoners, angsty teens, stressed out college kids and the rare nutcase that come through. Once we get near 4am, I then do the usual closing up procedure, roller doors, trash and footage, along with reports.

What I could not understand, though, is that the cameras would sometimes affix on random customers the other staff serve, usually focusing on the oddest of spots, like the neck flab of a man in a mobility scooter, or the broken arm of a wannabe punk artist. As I've said, the footage is hazy, so I don't understand why the cameras do it, meaning that I have to write those off as simple irrelevancy.

But, besides the bizarre customers and dreary co-workers, the late night trade pays well and goes by quickly. At least, it used to be, until last Monday.

Last Monday marked the start of it getting cold over here, real cold... Fog, cold dribbles of rain, dry winds and the usual prelude to winter. It also marked the night shift getting a lot less breezy.

I entered through the back, being waved at by Sarah as I turned left into the stockroom and walked past the shelves of overstocked items, heading for the staff breakroom and offices just on the other side. I'd gotten a chicken burger meal on the way, it was steaming hot, so I was a bit slower than my usual brisk pace, especially being rugged up in at least three layers. What was especially different was that after waving, I heard Sarah call to me. I looked back, seeing that she had been trying to wave me over, rather than wave goodbye.

Turning on my heels, I headed back to her, she looked a bit spooked, I then noticed her team had headed home early, from the looks of it, the night's load still had at least 2 pallets remaining (they were T3s, for anyone that is interested, soft drink and energy drinks.). I can clearly remember how our exchange went, as usually I was the one to get a conversation started, but this time, Sarah spoke first:

'Nate, I'm gonna be staying back tonight for a bit, alright? Apparently some weirdo was lingering at the roller doors, staring at team members. I'll be clocked off, but I want you to keep your earpiece on you.'

I shrugged, but then nodded.

'Alright, you want me to tell the other team members to keep an eye out?'

She seemed to flinch when I mentioned the team, which caused me to frown, why was she wanting me to keep information about a possible person that needed blacklisting from my team?

'No, I don't think that'd be best, it's just... a hunch, I guess.'

'You're not one for hunches, though.'

I'd known Sarah since I started at the store, her and I were part of the same hiring pool, started same day, we'd built a decent work friendship, it was unlike her to act this way, more to keep anything to herself when it came to her thoughts.

'I can't say... just follow me.'

Sarah didn't budge, instead deciding to drag me off like a lost child to the communications office.

At our work place, there are two offices, David's Office, where meetings are held and paperwork is kept, then there is the Communications Office, where we store two outdated PCs, our singular printer and the charging dock for our walkies and earpieces, it is also where you have to clock in on the computer, entering payroll number and your personalised password. Both offices are the only rooms in the staff only area that have locks besides the back door and loading bay roller door.

Sarah handed me an earpiece, the mess of wires having to be untangled in my one free hand so the power source could clip onto my belt and the tiny audio receiver could clip to my work shirt's breast pocket. The earpiece itself looping around my ear and the speaker dangling just above the eardrum.

'Listen, I just need you to be my eyes and ears out there, alright? I can do the reports and footage for you, as long as you let me stay in the main office. Don't let the others know I'm here.'

Sarah definitely was acting strange, evasive, without a moment for me to even ask what the hell she was on about, the lock clicked on the door to David's office, leaving me alone for the next five minutes.

Usually, if I had the time, I'd have looked at what we had stored in the overstock shelves, but the now lukewarm burger beckoned to me, as I felt my body yearn for some sustenance. I obliged it and quickly stored away my clothing in my work locker, still keeping at least a jacket and scarf on me, having to fiddle with my name badge to get it to click onto my jacket instead of my shirt. As I stepped out of the men's locker room, I then heard the far off noise of my co-workers cars pulling into the parking spaces.

Sarah was silent on the communication channel, even as I did a headcount on the mopey crew I called my teammates, though I could have sworn one looked slightly confused at me. If they had tried to speak, though, it seems they didn't see the point in bothering.

All went normal, or as normal as serving the odd and zany could be. It was around 1am that I heard Sarah on the earpiece, seems she had gone over to the communications office once the other team members had clocked in, I could hear the whirring of the overtaxed fan within one of the PCs on her end.

'Register 3, man in a mobility scooter, back of his neck.'

It was a surprise to hear her, but I made sure to show little sign of reacting, hiding the surprise with the realisation that I had not refilled the drink fridges on the registers, something that gave me an excuse to go past Register 3.

Registers 1 and 2 had fully stocked beverages, but 3 had been decently emptied, a good amount of traffic having passed through, the current customer being served was a rather obese man on a mobility scooter. I didn't judge people's weight, but internally, I did feel sorry for how his joints must be, at least, until I caught sight of the back of his neck, right at the nape. I didn't understand what I saw, at least, not immediately.

'What do you see?'

Sarah asked, I didn't respond, I averted my gaze and placed the drinks in according order. Though I think the customer noticed, as a rumbling voice came to my attention, a thick lisp to his voice.

'Excoose me, do you hath sum shashparella?'

I looked down to the crate of drinks in my hands, I did indeed, so I handed one to him, but he seemed disappointed.

'Maw pweash'

I offered the crate and he beamed like a child on Christmas day. He took all of them, which, in my honest opinion, was financially wasteful, a 350ml bottle of sars from us runs you $3.50 per bottle, he had taken at least 23 of them, minus the one I had put on the shelf of the drink fridge. The server shot a death stare at me, as she had to put more items in more bags for her customer, but the customer himself was quite happy, he turned back, nestling back into his scooter.

The first time I saw it, I didn't understand, but now... now I saw that what were at first glance rolls of skin, were in fact lips, pale, but with the occasional, thick tongue poking out to lick and slather the area with drool. I went stiff, as I then turned and walked.

I wish I was someone who experienced fear like the typical person, but whenever I get scared, I get stiff and cold, the polar opposite to an adrenaline rush. Luckily, though, it seemed no one noticed. The store was otherwise quiet, not even a minute after what had happened at Register 3, I clocked off for a 15 minute break.

Getting to the breakroom was a blessing, it was warm, ten times better than the shop floor, but even better was being able to lock myself in the Communications Office with Sarah, after I gave her a quick message on the comms channel.

'I saw it, let me in.'

The Communications Office was really warm, the PCs had been warming up a lot, and Sarah was looking expectantly at me.

'Well?'

She leaned against the dirty white plastic case of the printer.

'Well... the man had...'

Sarah stared expectantly at me, I felt like I was being pranked.

'This is a prank, isn't it?'

I decided to ask, Sarah looked offended, then concerned.

'Nathan, this is not a prank, tell me, now.'

I was unsure, I doubted her, but I answered honestly.

'I don't know... lips? And tongues?'

Sarah stared through me, as if I wasn't there, then she turned to the PC, pointing at multiple reports from prior nights I had worked as Front End Manager on. There that same man in the mobility scooter was, each time, the cameras pointed to his neck.

'I still don't know what this has to do with that mentioned weirdo.'

She didn't respond, instead just pulling up a grainy and dark image, from much earlier, during her shift, same body shape, but not sitting on his scooted... rather, he was standing on what almost looked like a blob of flesh, like a slug.

I shook my head.

'It's too late for this... he's probably some weirdo looking to freak people out with practical effects, some people do that.'

I didn't believe myself, I wanted to, but there was no way that what I saw could make sense in any way but the supernatural.

'Well, how about this, you get no other weird customer until 3am, I leave. Sound good?'

Sarah gave a decent ultimatum, it was about 1:36am, at that time, I'd be back on the floor at 1:45am. I nodded and then exited the office. I heard her relock it behind me.

I had a poor quality cup of instant noodles, before I got back onto the floor, heading back to my spot of work, the main counter.

Any activity in the store had crawled to a snail's pace, only got one customer through, a confused driver asking for directions, as we were the only place open in the center of town. He was nice enough, came along to visit his Grandpa in the nearby town.

It was at 2:55am that it came into the store.

On first glance, you would think it was the average drug addict, scraggly hair, wrinkled skin, rotted teeth, attitude to match. But it was when it came to my register that I found it to be anything but. It looked like a woman, probably late 50s, a bit younger than my own mum, but without any of the graceful aging she had been granted.

'Twenty ciggies now. My uuuuuusual.'

I'm used to customers being rude or impatient, but I had no clue on what their usual meant, so I responded as would be expected.

'Sorry? What type do you take?'

It's bony fingers tensed into balled fists as it smacked the counter, screaming like a banshee.

'THE BLUE ONES!!!'

I froze, to it, I stood still and stared back, but internally, I was assessing the threat they posed. If they jumped the counter, I had good chances of escaping, due to how high it is, if they tried to punch me from there, I could move back. So, I took a breath in and tried to deescalate the situation.

'Ma'am, I need a brand name, please, there's no need to get aggressive.'

It shook, then, to my silent and unflinching horror, mashed it's face into the counter. I heard something crack, then something rip, but not in the way you'd expect meat to, but instead how rubber would.

'I... I just want some Earls Blues, darling.'

Its neck had bent like a rubber hose, craning to the side at a sharp 180 degree turn, their face was contorted and flattened by the impact, like a clay sculpture being pressed down while still wet. I now could also tell that the skin had a leathery texture to it, with a rather grey tone, utterly inhuman.

I was terrified, but I did as it asked, grabbed the brand it wanted, was handed a pair of $50 bills, they didn't even stay for me giving them the change, instead giggling like a lunatic as they hopped out the exit of the store with the cigarette carton cupped in their hands. When all went quiet, I looked to the registers, none of my co-workers had looked up.

The rest of the night went by slowly, at least, until the trash run came. This time, I chose to take the trash myself, letting my dour co-workers shuffle off to the back room to restock the snacks section of their registers.

I hadn't heard from Sarah until I went to do the trash run, she probably saw me doing the preparations.

'Meet you at the dock, act like I came in to check in.'

I've never been one to waste time, but I spent a solid 10 minutes outside, in silence, with Sarah keeping to the shadow cast by the dumpster. I had thrown the bags in, but I just needed to be near an actual human, after what I had seen.

'I saw what happened.'

I didn't respond. She knew that my reaction to trauma, fear and tension was to internalise it and to freeze up.

'I'll give you a lift home, would your old lady lets me crash on the couch?'

I nodded. Had been since I was 15 that I had someone sleep over, but I think her and I were both too spooked to want to venture into the night alone. But we didn't have enough time to be talking, so I swallowed my fear and headed back inside, with Sarah in tow.

Closing up procedure went easily, but the co-workers stared at Sarah, despite her given reason, that she was doing the last two pallets before the morning load came in. I had to actively yell at one to move from his station, to which he grunted and turned away. I got a worrying hunch that I was best to keep Sarah and the Graveyard Shift separate.

Finally, it was home time, the Graveyard Shift filtered out and it was just me and Sarah. Filing reports and finishing up the pallets was easy enough, she gave me a spare box cutter so I could actually break the tape. I also learnt how to unload a cardboard bailer, it was pretty fun.

After all the clean up, it was 4:23am, everything was filed away and tidied up. Not the best end time, but for a night where the night fill team was lacking some people, we made good progress.

It was as Sarah and I headed for her ute that I witnessed something that I wish I had not seen. It was the entity that had verbally assaulted me and broke its neck earlier, rummaging through the dumpster. For a brief moment, I caught it's gaze, as it munched on receipt papers as if it was a horse eating grass. It had too many teeth, but I saw that it smiled.

The drive back home was uneventful, thankfully, but I did notice that Sarah kept looking back to me, worried, as if I was going to just vanish.

When we got home, I accidentally woke mum up, Coal was still fast asleep, but at least Sarah was welcomed to stay the night, she didn't have work the following work day. She was set up next to the fire place and given a bunch of blankets, alongside the three person couch, safe to say, I was jealous, seemed extra cosy compared to my own room.

Getting to sleep was hard, practically impossible, before I knew it, it was 8am and Coal was scratching at my door for his morning snuggles. I got two hours of sleep, thanks to the affectionate blob of fur that is that cat, I think Mum and Sarah got chatting in the meantime.

By the time I was up, it was 10:25am and I had work in an hour and a half. Sadly meaning I could not hang around for long, having to dose myself with as much coffee as I could handle and treat myself to a quick hot shower before throwing on the work gear I had worn just the night prior. I didn't feel like ironing it, not after the night prior.

Today went by with no issue, luckily it was Tuesday, so Kyle was doing the promo ends, meaning Front End got some fancy new magazines to advertise to customers. It also means I don't need to stay back. But when it came to closing time, I decided to do a quick lap of the store.

I came up empty handed, half expected my curiosity to be rewarded with the cigarette obsessed thing running at me from around the corner like a possessed maniac. Instead, I just found sleepy pigeons huddling in the old vents for warmth and a single homeless man, who I gave $5, as he usually busks during the day inside the shopping center our store is attached to.

Now I'm here, wasting away unpaid time, typing this all down. I checked the clock and realised it's almost 9pm. I'll have to get going, keep getting the occasional weird look from members of night fill for staying back so late to type this down on one of the computers.

Sarah is going to pick me up, I think it's going to be safer that way, at least, at night.  
I've had to tell her a couple times that I will be late and she should just wait for me to call, so best for me to finish this. I think Kyle especially is annoyed, but he left at 4pm, after setting up the ends, he's now the Grocery ADM, not sure what by, though. I should probably ask him for advice, shouldn't I? But can I trust him to believe that I saw some sort of slug man and a rubbery psycho junkie?

I'll put an end to this post now, but please, give me advice on how I can deal with any of this, if you believe me. I feel like I'm up a creek without a paddle.

I'm also up to answering questions, if you're curious about anything, maybe they will lead to answers too.

Thank you all for reading, Nate signing off.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.
