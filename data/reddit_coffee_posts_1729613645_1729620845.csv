1g9ova7,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1g9ova7/lpt_walking_to_burn_calories/,LPT: Walking to burn calories,"One of the most underrated and easiest ways to burn some extra calories is simply walking. I’ve found that getting out in the morning before work for a quick stroll not only wakes me up but also helps me wakeup in the morning time. I make it a point to fit in a 10-12 minute walk, whether it’s on my treadmill or just pacing around the house. Sometimes I’ll combine it with other activities like reading my Kindle, sipping on a coffee, or even listening to a podcast. By the end of the day, I typically burn around 350 calories just from walking alone. It’s such an easy, low-impact way to stay active, especially when you don’t have time for a full workout. Plus, it's not just about the calorie burn, these walks help me clear my head, improve focus, and boost my mood. It’s amazing how something so simple can have such a big impact.",1,1729620710.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

I'm struggling a lot more again at the moment so this has been such a huge issue. I live in supported living for my ed and I have to have a snack in the afternoon and eat it with our carers/social workers. But I can choose at what time so it fits my schedule better. So I'll be like now I'm feeling like eating my snack and I'll go downstairs and then if they're busy with someone else or in a meeting or whatever I get literally so upset. I guess it could also be related to my autism, because I hate changes in my plans. 
Another thing that I hope won't be too big an issue is my supplements. I have the Resource from Nestle (just like Fortisip or Ensure). And I like the chocolate and the vanilla one. Since I'm struggling at the moment I need to have multiple a day. My supplier is awesome, each month when I have to order I can choose the flavors I want and we can say how much we need. Today they called me (tomorrow is the next delivery) and she said there's an issue with the shipment of the chocolate and the coffee one (I did order this one too for a change) and I am so so scared that there's gonna be a shortage. The chocolate one is my absolute favorite and I can't live off of just the vanilla one. She said they're gonna send what they have and then when the rest comes in they'll ship it to me so thats good. But since I have to have a lot atm I also ordered the strawberry one to try and another one that is supposed to be like juice I think instead of milky. So if I like those I'll have more options if the chocolate one is gonna be an actual issue.

Had to cut off my mom last night and I'm feeling guilty,"I have zero reason to feel guilty that I cut her off, but I do. I have an 11 month old (12 months on the 30th!) baby. I don't really let her be around baby too much, because she's kind of toxic. But recently, within the last 6 months, she has been awesome. Super helpful, supportive, and always there for me. 

She'd never done that as a mom. I unfortunately did get a little attachment and trust to her. Welp, she f*cked it all the way up yesterday. 

First, she tried to give my daughter coffee last week. I told her no, and she argued with me about it. Ok, thought that was stupid, but she begrudgingly followed what I said, so I told myself I was overreacting. 

Then, two days ago, she gave my daughter soda, WHILE I WAS ACTIVELY YELLING NO. She gave me attitude and told me it was just a taste. It was a huge argument. I should have cut her off then and there, but I gave her an ultimatum instead. Told her if she gave my baby anything she knows I'm against again, I would never let her see her again. 

Well, yesterday, she comes up to my baby, dips her in finger in some drink she has, and tried to put it in babies mouth. I stop her and ask what it is. She paused, and then admitted it was vodka redbull. I lost my shit on her. She just played the victim and kept reaffirming she's not doing anything wrong, that I'm overreacting, etc.

Today, I'm honestly feeling a lot of emotions. I'm sad and feel heartbroken. I also feel angry. And I feel guilty I didn't cut her off after the soda incident. 

I know she needs to stay cut off. For my daughter's safety. Yesterday it was vodka redbull, tomorrow it might be a party drug or some other equally outrageous shit. 

I feel ashamed I even got close to her. But I am proud I never left them alone. I have cut off really close family before. It's always painful the first year. The last family member I cut off was an uncle I loved... But I found out he raped his sister when she was 6 (and he was in his 20s). He raised me while my parents were neglecting me, never did anything to me, so it was still a painful bond to break. 

Idk. I'm going to stick to cutting her off. But what can make it easier? My daughter has a b day party this weekend, that my mom is no longer invited to, and I feel like I'm just going to be sad now. I was so excited for it. :/ ",4,1729619829.0,Mommit,1,1.0,False

Morning light filtered through the RV’s windows, casting a soft glow across the small table. Lethira sat with her head in her hands, groaning softly, a cup of coffee steaming beside her and some ibuprofen. Lina sat across from her, quietly eating cereal.

""I feel like I’ve been run over by a truck,"" Lethira muttered, massaging her temples.  

Lina glanced up, suppressing a smile.  
""Thats what you get for drinking your ass off.""

Lethira shot her a look but couldn’t help the faint smile that tugged at her lips. She sighed and took a small sip of her tea.  
""I’m sorry about last night,"" her voice was rough with regret.  
""That wasn’t my best moment.""

Lina rolled her eyes. ""It sure wasn't.”

Lethira sighed again and reached for her water, taking a long drink. There was a brief, comfortable silence before Lina changed the subject.  
""By the way, I checked the RV’s battery this morning. Still at 100 percent.""

Lethira blinked, her hangover momentarily forgotten.  
""Still full? After all of yesterday?""

Lina nodded, smiling faintly.  
""Yeah. And the Rivian didn’t lose any juice either. I think your runes are working.""

Lethira smiled despite herself, a flicker of pride breaking through her headache.  
""Well, at least something is going according to plan."" She took another sip of her coffee, grateful for the small victory.

""So, no worries about the batteries,"" Lina added.

Lethira chuckled softly.  
""Exactly, no more worries.""  

—

Lethira stood in the grand tent, its once lively atmosphere now replaced by an eerie calm. The traces of last night’s revelry had vanished, the floor swept clean, leaving the space stark and somber in the early morning light. She glanced back at the Rivian and RV, now parked closer to the tent, away from the portal’s platform where they had arrived the night before. 

Behind her, a large black screen, the TV from the RV, sat on a makeshift table. Her rugged tablet, propped up on the table in front of her, connected to the screen by a long cable. Beside the tablet, two globes rested on stands—their surfaces tracing different realities. The first depicted Earth's geographically, oceans, continents, rivers, mountains and landmasses.

All identical to every realm.

 The second one depicted the borders of the human nations and their capitals.

Underneath the table, a large crate sat packed with the tools of her argument—books with dog-eared pages, scrolls of delicate parchment, maps carefully marked with ink. All gathered, all necessary. 

The chairs before her slowly filled. The quiet murmurs of those gathered—a mix of military officers, nobles, and high-ranking officials—drifted toward her, punctuated by the occasional glance in her direction. Her family was among them. 

Her father sat expectantly beside her mother and sister, both slowly emerging from their hangovers. Amidst it all, Lunira entered, drawing Lethira's eye for just a moment—her flat belly still proudly displayed despite the gravity of the gathering as she sat besides her mother. 

“_Don't get distracted_” she chastised her self as Lathen followed his sister in and sat besides her.

Today, she had to convince them all to abandon the planned invasion and forget about the prophecy.

She inhaled deeply, the air heavy with tension. The time for words was approaching, and the truth of her findings would either save them or be ignored at their peril.

Lethira clapped her hands, drawing the room's attention. The quiet murmur of voices halted, and the gathered officials and nobles turned toward her. The tent, cleared of its revelry, now felt cold and tense under the pale morning light. Her fingers tightened around the tablet as she began.

“I thank you all for being here today,” Lethira started, her voice steady but carrying the weight of urgency. “What I’m about to show you will determine the future of the empire.”

She turned on the TV behind her. The crowd’s eyes followed the glow of the screen, curiosity flickering on their faces.

She stepped aside, gesturing toward the large TV screen behind her. A soft click echoed as she tapped the rugged tablet, and the black screen blinked to life.
“Ok, so, I know many of you are unfamiliar with these devices,” she said, waving toward the screen and tablet. “Think of them as magic mirrors, capable of displaying images and information instantly.” She offered no further explanation. The intricacies of technology weren’t important right now—what mattered was the data.
 The first image appeared: a satellite map of Earth, its continents, oceans, and mountains clear in intricate detail. Some of the officials leaned forward, nodding as they recognized the familiar topography.

“This is the human realm,” Lethira explained. “The geography is identical to the realms we know. No surprises there.”

Her fingers tapped the tablet again, and the screen changed to a political map of Earth. Hundreds of borders snaked across the continents, forming a patchwork of nations. “And this is how they are divided” Lethira continued, her voice steady. “196 nations, each with its own government, its own military.”

Lethira watched as one older general shifted in his seat, his brows furrowing.

“These humans… they fight amongst themselves then?” His gravelly voice broke through the tension.

“Yes,” Lethira nodded. “Some of these nations are fighting each other. Most conflicts are internal uprisings and civil wars. There are around such 30 conflicts. However the vast majority of nations are not at war.” the next map highlighted all current conflict zones.

She tapped the tablet again. The screen now displayed a stock image of a diverse group of humans. Above the image, the number 8 billion appeared in bold Elvish script. A hush fell over the tent as the number sank in.

“Eight billion,” Lethira said quietly, letting the enormity of the number hang in the silence. “This is their population.”

Disbelief rippled through the audience. General Velorth leaned forward, his voice heavy with incredulity. “That’s… twice the number of all sentient beings in our eight realms combined!”

Lethira gave a grim nod. “Yes. Twice.”

A tense quiet settled over the room, each individual wrestling with the enormity of the figures presented. Her father, Lord Luridar, sat motionless, the hard set of his jaw betraying his troubled thoughts. His sharp gaze darted between Lethira and the map.

“Eight billion…” Virionna, a silver-haired noblewoman, muttered in shock. “How do they sustain such a population? Their soil must be utterly exhausted and polluted!”

Lethira responded, “They have highly intensive farming techniques, and yes, it is strained and polluted. Now, let’s move on.” With a swipe on the tablet, she displayed another map marked with population data. “These are the populations of each nation.”

The room fell even more silent as the numbers appeared.

Lethira shifted the screen again. “Next, military size.” A map showing military forces spread across the globe appeared. “There are around 27 million active soldiers among all human nations, and another 50 million in reserve.”

A murmur spread through the crowd, the weight of those figures settling into the minds of the gathered officials.

Junior Shadow Blade Velira, seated near the front, spoke up, her tone filled with an anxious resolve. “We could still defeat them, one nation at a time, overwhelming them with our wyverns and dragons.”

Lethira shook her head, her expression grim. “I’m afraid that won’t be possible. In the absence of magic, humans have mastered the natural sciences to a degree far beyond our grasp of magic. This knowledge has permeated every aspect of their society—including warfare.” She tapped on her tablet. “This is a fighter aircraft.” The screen displayed an image of a sleek, modern fighter jet—specifically a German Eurofighter.

“It’s capable of traveling faster than the speed of sound,” Lethira added, switching to a video of the jet breaking the sound barrier.

“Faster than sound?” Commander Kalthorn of the Wyvern Corps scoffed, eyes wide. “How is that possible?”

Lethira hesitated, then shrugged. “The engineering and science behind it are too complex to explain quickly. Even I don’t fully understand the mechanics.”

The assembly shifted uneasily.

“These aircraft can strike moving targets from a range of around 40 leagues,” she continued, her voice steady.

A nobleman shot up from his seat, his face flushed. “That’s preposterous!” he exclaimed, his frustration evident.

Lethira’s eyes met his evenly. “It’s true. I’ve seen it myself. The details of how they do it are often military secrets, but the results are undeniable.”

Someone from the back, General Orellius, spoke up, concern etched into his face. “Can they harm dragons?”

“I believe they can,” Lethira replied soberly. “Those missiles can travel at four times the speed of sound.”

“How many of these ‘aircraft’ do they have?” Lord Vaelor’s voice, deep and authoritative, cut through the growing panic.

Lethira answered, “Among all nations, around 13,000. The nation on the other side of the portal—Germany—has 232 fighter jets. Other types of combat aircraft, like helicopters, are used for transporting troops and providing air support.” The screen shifted again to display military helicopters.

Murmurs of anxiety rippled through the crowd. Even her family, once confident, looked shaken.

“And now,” Lethira said, her voice firm, “we move on to their infantry.” The TV showed a photograph of a German soldier. “This is a soldier from the Federal Republic of Germany—the country on the other side of the portal.”

Lethira paused, allowing the image to sink in. “Human soldiers no longer use swords, bows, or arrows. Instead, they wield automatic firearms—tools that fire projectiles rapidly. This soldier’s weapon, for example, can fire up to 1,125 rounds per minute.”

“That’s absurd!” A gruff voice bellowed from the back. Lethira’s eyes found the source—Chief Master Engineer Durrak, a stout dwarf with a long white beard. “The level of precision required to craft such a mechanism to work reliably is beyond imagining!”

“Well, Chief Master Engineer Durrak,” Lethira said, maintaining her composure, “humans have developed ways to mass-produce tools and machines with unimaginable precision. The device I’m holding—this tablet—contains components so small, they’re measured in atoms.”

The dwarf blinked, momentarily speechless.

Lethira continued, “I brought books and resources for further study, but translation will be needed.”

Durrak gave a stiff nod, visibly calmer, though still wary.

Turning back to the screen, Lethira resumed. “Now, about their infantry tactics. A typical engagement range for rural combat is between 400 and 650 paces, while in urban settings, it’s often less than 130 paces. You’ll also notice,” she said, gesturing to the image, “that their soldiers wear camouflage, much like how our Shadow Blades operate in covert missions.”

Lethira’s gaze swept across the tent, reading the uncertainty in her audience. “For those of you who need further convincing,” she began, stepping over to a small box she’d set near the desk, “I’ll offer a demonstration.”
With practiced ease, she opened the box and pulled out a sleek black pistol, holding it up for all to see. “This,” she announced, “is a human firearm—a Heckler & Koch P30. You could think of it as their equivalent of a dagger.”
The pistol drew curious and wary glances from the crowd. Nalira, seated with her arms crossed, raised an eyebrow. “A mere dagger? Why not bring a proper rifle if you wanted to show us their true power?”
Lethira hesitated, choosing her words carefully. “Firearms are tightly controlled in the human realm, especially the more powerful ones. They're mostly restricted to military and law enforcement. Obtaining this handgun was difficult enough.” She left out the fact that she did, in fact, have a rifle stowed safely away in her RV.
Without further explanation, Lethira walked to a corner of the tent where she had three ceramic vases and a wooden stool waiting. She placed one of the vases carefully on the stool, then turned back to the assembly. “Chief Master Mage Lorian, would you care to assist?”
A moment passed before a young lieutenant mage stood up, clearing his throat awkwardly. “The Chief Master Mage is… unavailable. He drank a bit too much last night and, well, he hasn’t woken up yet.”
Lethira rolled her eyes, crossing her arms. “Typical. Very well, Lieutenant Vareth, you’ll have to do. Come here.”
Vareth moved to join her, looking somewhat nervous under the scrutiny of the gathered officials. “Stand behind me for now,” she instructed, as she took aim at the vase. Without hesitation, Lethira squeezed the trigger, the loud bang of the shot echoing through the tent. Several of the onlookers, still recovering from hangovers, flinched visibly at the sound. The vase shattered into dust.
“Now,” Lethira said, gesturing to the remains of the first vase, “place another vase on the stool. And this time, I want you to create a protective shield around it. The kind of shield you would use in battle to protect a soldier.”
Vareth nodded, stepping forward to place the next vase. With a few gestures and whispered words, a shimmering, translucent shield enveloped the vase, casting prismatic colors in the early light. Lethira took aim again, eyes narrowing slightly.
She fired, and once more the bullet pierced through the magic barrier like it wasn’t even there, reducing the second vase to rubble. Gasps and murmurs of disbelief filled the air.
“Again,” Lethira said calmly, handing the final vase to Vareth. “But this time, put everything you have into it. All your might. And if you manage to stop the bullet…” she added with a teasing grin, “I’ll give you my underwear.”
The young mage blushed deeply, but the jest lit a fire in his eyes. His hands moved more confidently this time as he formed the next shield, one that shimmered and pulsed with vibrant energy, much thicker and denser than the last. His brow furrowed in concentration, sweat beading on his forehead as he poured every ounce of his strength into the spell.
Lethira nodded approvingly, her eyes twinkling with amusement. “Well done,” she said, taking aim once more.
The gunshot rang out, and the bullet slammed into the shield. For a brief moment, it seemed to hold—until the shield shattered spectacularly, and the final vase exploded just as the others had. Vareth stumbled back, collapsing to the ground, drained from the effort and the sting of failure.
Lethira walked over, extending a hand to help him up. “You nearly stopped the weakest bullet available on the human market,” she said, her tone almost congratulatory. “But no prize underwear today, I’m afraid.”
The tent filled with nervous laughter, though the unease in the air was palpable. What Lethira had shown them was undeniable: their magic, revered and trusted for centuries, could be pierced by human technology without much effort.
Lethira straightened up, moving back toward the tablet. “Next, let’s discuss human military vehicles. These machines are designed to be nearly impervious to conventional attacks, carrying soldiers and heavy firepower into battle.”

She tapped on her tablet, and an image of a German Leopard 2 tank appeared on the large screen. The assembly stared, their expressions turning from confusion to concern.

“This,” Lethira continued, pointing to the display, “is an example of what they call a main battle tank. The Leopard 2, used by the nation closest to the portal—Germany. It weighs as much as 120 cows, and its armor is formidable, made of materials that can withstand the mightiest of blows.”

General Aradorn, known for his skepticism, leaned forward slightly. “Armor is armor,” he muttered. “Any heavy projectile or spell could penetrate it, surely?”

“Not easily,” Lethira corrected. “Their armor isn’t based on magic, but natural science. And more troubling is the weapon it carries. That large tube is a cannon, capable of launching devastating attacks. It can strike accurately from 10 leagues away.” 

She tapped on the screen, and the display shifted to show the cannon in action, its explosive power leaving a deep crater in the earth.

Aradorn remained unconvinced but said nothing further. Virionna, however, leaned in, clearly troubled. “How many of these armored beasts does Germany possess?”

“Over 300,” Lethira answered. “But across all human nations, there are an estimated 17,500 of these metal monsters.”

A ripple of dismay spread through the tent. Velira bit her lip. “Even with wyverns in the air, how could we face such a force?”

Lethira didn’t pause, moving to the next display. This one showed a variety of armored vehicles—transporters, infantry fighting vehicles, and artillery. “And they don’t rely only on tanks. These are their vehicles for transporting soldiers and heavy equipment.”

Another tap, and the screen showed a hulking machine with large, mounted cannons. “And this… this is their artillery.”

The room tensed. Artillery was a familiar concept, but nothing like this.

“These are no mere trebuchets,” Lethira warned. “This is mechanized artillery, oversized rifles, capable of firing projectiles from a distance of 10 leagues, far beyond any spell we can cast. And these shells move five times the speed of sound.”

Vareth, his earlier confidence shaken, frowned. “That’s artillery? We have catapults and ballistae. This doesn’t seem—”

“These are far deadlier,” Lethira interrupted. “Human armies don’t need to see the enemy to strike them. They rely on something called ‘satellites,’ which are positioned far in their skies, constantly watching and guiding these weapons with pinpoint accuracy.”

Chief Master Engineer Durrak, who had earlier protested her claims, now leaned forward with keen interest. “Satellites? And they track… beyond what the eye can see?”

“Yes,” Lethira confirmed, moving the display to show diagrams of how satellites worked. “With these, human artillery can strike with deadly precision, even if the enemy is leagues away.”

The quiet murmurs grew as realization set in. Aradorn looked around the room, clearly unsettled. “They could bombard us without us even knowing?”

“Exactly,” Lethira said. “From ranges that would make any counterattack nearly impossible.”

A deep silence followed as the enormity of her words weighed heavily on the assembly. Even her family seemed taken aback. Finally, Virionna asked, her voice low, “Is there no way to counter such power?”

Lethira sighed. “That’s why I’ve brought you here. If we continue with this invasion, we will face the destruction of our empire.”

The room fell into a heavy silence once again. Now, the full scope of the danger was beginning to settle in. Lethira knew the hardest part of her presentation was still to come, but she had their attention—and their fear.

Lethira paused, noting the growing unease in the room. “Now,” she began, her voice steady, “I need to show you the most terrifying weapon the humans possess. They call it nuclear power, and it is the single greatest threat to our existence, should we provoke them.”

The nobles shifted uncomfortably in their chairs, and Lethira clicked to display an image of a mushroom cloud rising into the sky, its scale dwarfing mountains in the background. Gasps filled the room.

“This,” she pointed to the ominous cloud, “is the result of one nuclear bomb—one.”

The tension in the tent became palpable. Aradorn looked at her, disbelief and fear in his eyes. “One… weapon? It looks like it leveled an entire city.”

Lethira nodded. “Yes. And it did.” She glanced at her notes briefly before continuing. “This particular bomb, dropped during a human war centuries ago, killed over 140,000 people in an instant and poisoned the land for decades. Today, the bombs are many times more powerful.”

Virionna’s voice trembled as she spoke. “How… how do they even harness such power?”

“They've managed to split heavy atoms, which turns out releases an enormous amounts of energy. When they unleash it, the explosion releases unimaginable heat, light, and force.”

She shifted the image on the TV to show a diagram of the Earth's nations again, this time marked with dots. “There are roughly 13,000 of these weapons spread across the different human nations. The humans refer to them as their last line of defense. Once one is used, retaliation is almost guaranteed.”

One of the younger nobles, still skeptical, raised his voice. “Surely they wouldn’t use them against us—after all, they’d destroy their own world in the process.”

Lethira’s expression hardened. “They’ve developed ways to deliver these bombs from the skies or even from the seas, without stepping foot on enemy territory. They’ve built missiles, launched from ships or silos buried in the ground, that can travel 2,000 leagues in mere moments, guided by their satellites.”

She brought up an image of a missile silo. “This is where they keep some of these weapons. If we were to strike first, this is what we’d be facing in retaliation.”

Silence gripped the room. Vareth leaned forward, his voice barely above a whisper. “How many of these missiles do they have?”

Lethira answered without hesitation. “13 thousand. Each far more destructive than the one I just showed you.”

The audience seemed frozen, the weight of her words sinking in. An older noble spoke up. “Is there anyway to survive against them?”

Lethira shook her head, her tone almost apologetic. “Only reinforced bunkers buried dozens of paces deep and that is if the aren't hit directly.”

One of the officers in the back, his face pale, asked, “Do they all have these… these bombs?”

“No,” Lethira replied. “Only nine human nations possess them. The infrastructure to produce the fuel is very expensive, time consuming, and risky. The fuel used is extremely poisonous, so much so that just being in its presence without special protective equipment can condemn you to a slow painful death, and if you somehow survive it, any children you conceive afterward will be born deformed. Much worse than any curse. Enemy nations would also try to disrupt the efforts”

Virionna shook her head, disbelief still clouding her voice. “How do they live with such destruction hanging over them?”

Lethira’s expression softened. “With fear and caution. Most humans live their lives hoping these weapons are never used. But as long as they exist, the threat remains. Ironically these weapons have probably saved countless lives because of wars that haven't been fought thanks to fear of these weapons. Their greatest military powers haven't fought each other directly since these weapons were first created seven decades ago.”

Lethira let the last image of the nuclear weapons fade away, allowing the weight of the information to settle among the gathering before she pressed on.

Here is the edited version with corrected grammatical errors and a name for the currency:

---

“Now,” Lethira began, taking a deep breath, “I need to explain something just as critical as the weapons themselves: alliances. Among humans, the balance of power doesn’t rely solely on individual nations but on vast alliances that bind them together.”

She tapped her tablet, and the TV screen shifted to a map highlighting NATO member nations. “This,” she said, gesturing to the screen, “is the most powerful military alliance in their world. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, that’s what they call the Eltherion Ocean, or NATO for short in the English language. It covers the continents of Galnoria and Western Velarys.”

“Twenty-seven million soldiers, just in NATO alone?” one of the officers murmured, his voice tense.

“No,” Lethira corrected, “NATO is a military alliance of 32 nations, many of the wealthiest nations in the human realm. If one member is attacked, all others will come to its defense. Together, they have a combined 3.4 million active soldiers and another 3.4 million reserves. The Federal Republic of Germany, where the portal connects, has around 180,000 active soldiers and 930,000 in reserve.”

She brought up a map of the NATO countries, with arrows representing the alliance's potential response to an attack. “Germany’s military may not seem the strongest at first glance, but if we invade them, we are not fighting them alone. The United States, the most powerful military nation in their world, would be bound to intervene.”

Another image appeared, this time showing a map of the United States. Lethira continued. “The United States is the hegemon of the human world. Its influence isn’t just military—it’s cultural, economic, political. Their culture, music, and technology dominate the globe. But militarily, they are the largest. They have around 1.4 million active-duty soldiers and 860,000 in reserve, plus the most advanced weapons on Earth.”

Aradorn leaned forward, frowning. “What makes them stronger than the rest?”

“They spend more on their military than the next seven nations combined. In fact, they spend more on their military every year than what the Empire taxes in three years across all eight realms,” Lethira said, her voice grim. “They have the largest navy, thousands of aircraft, and the most technologically advanced weapons. If they are dragged into a war, they have the capability to strike anywhere on the planet in less than a day, and they have 50,000 troops permanently stationed in Germany.”

The room was silent, but the undercurrent of fear and disbelief was palpable.

Lethira clicked again, bringing up the United Nations’ emblem. “Now, there’s also this.” She gestured to the screen. “The United Nations. Every nation on Earth, nearly 200 in total, has representatives in this organization. They have their disagreements, but in times of crisis, they try to maintain peace, at least through diplomacy.”

She moved through images of UN meetings, showcasing the rows of world leaders gathered in one place. “It’s not a military organization like NATO, but it’s another structure that binds the humans together. It offers diplomatic channels for resolving conflicts. Now, I don’t really believe nations outside the NATO alliance would actually do anything, but it wouldn’t make a difference for us.”

She paused, her eyes scanning the room. Her father, still processing the enormity of what had been shown, seemed to be deep in thought. Others looked around at each other, some still grappling with the details.

The younger officer from earlier, Vareth, spoke up, trying to regain some optimism. “So, if we strike fast enough, couldn’t we overrun their defenses before these alliances are triggered?”

Lethira shook her head, her tone grave. “No. NATO’s systems are designed to respond instantly. And with the technology they have, we wouldn’t make it far before they mobilize their forces. The moment the first arrow is loosed, the entire alliance would react.”

Virionna finally spoke, her voice low and almost despairing. “So, we’re outnumbered, outarmed, and would face the combined might of nations that have fought more wars than we can imagine?”

“Yes,” Lethira replied, her voice carrying the finality of someone who had seen enough. “It would be suicide.”

The room grew eerily silent once more as her words lingered in the air, heavy with the weight of inevitable destruction.

Lethira sighed. “Look, I know every single one of you has looked forward to this day your whole lives. The Empire has dreamed about this day for a millennia. And I have just crushed those dreams. I know the hardliners and priests will say that a prophecy that is impossible to fulfill is heresy.”

She clapped her hands, offering a more promising smile. “Now we have two options. We could bury the portal and forget it ever existed. Or we could open it and establish peaceful contact with the humans and make _very_ profitable trade.”

At that, the mood improved and interest was piqued. “Trade, you say? How much profit do you think we could get?” asked a noblewoman.

Lethira smirked knowingly. “Unfathomable amounts of wealth. I’m talking _trillions_ of Mooncoins. NATO nations happen to have a weakness: the critical minerals and metals for their technology and industry are mostly in the hands of rival nations. Most of these minerals have been useless to us, but they covet them greatly. NATO nations are _very_ wealthy and would be willing to pay a lot to secure alternative sources. And I think they will be interested in our magic too.”

She looked around as the prospect of great wealth washed over the room. 

Lunira finally spoke up, a playful glint in her eye. “You just had to leave the fun part for last, didn’t you?”

The room erupted in laughter.

He sat with her outside her apartment while the ambulance was on the way to pick her up. Her HR was high and her O2 levels were low, BP levels were okay. 

Everyone’s responses at my home group were on both sides of the aisle: focus on my own sobriety and not interact with her until she was sober, and others said to be there for her and show up for her. It’s a hard place to be and felt selfish to focus on myself, but ultimately focusing on others and their problems led me to this place of turning to substances and drinking. 

For context, I’m almost 2 months sober from alcohol and although that urge to drink hasn’t come up, the urge to turn towards a recent co-dependent relationship I was in was very much there. I knew if I put myself in the situation of focusing on my friend, I’d cave in and reach out to someone who’s asked me for space and time and I don’t want to ignore those boundaries. I appreciate all those who commented on my OG post (which I have below for anyone who didn’t see it).

[OG POST] I don’t know what to do

A friend of mine in AA relapsed today and relapsed a few weeks ago too. I got in touch with her sponsor and several “elders” in our home group to make sure that what I’m doing is the right thing to do. I know that my sobriety has to come first in these instances and what I’m struggling with the most is not wanting her to feel like I don’t care. 

I don’t have an urge to drink and reached out to my sponsor about the situation, but I know the self doubt and the urge to reach out to my ex is strong. Not to lean on her but because I want someone to validate that focusing on myself in these situations is important. 

I can’t 12 step my friend yet since she’s still drunk and told her I’d meet her for coffee before our home group meeting tonight but is there anything else I should do in these situations when a friend relapses? ",1,1729619773.0,alcoholicsanonymous,2,1.0,False

I am coming to you with a question regarding coffee beans. I am a beginner in espresso with only two months experience with the Barista Pro.
I had in the beginning some beans from lavazza and they were not great at all. After I finished them, I bought freshly roasted beans from a local roaster. The beans are medium roast, 100% arabica with origins from Brazil.  They were an improvement but the coffee still tasted either bitter or sour. 
After one of my colleagues recommended illy brasil, everything changed. They tasted perfect and every shot is really good. The beans are roasted on 28.08.2024
What am I doing wrong with the freshly roasted ones? I wdt, I tamp with a calibrated tamper. I used the beans after one week.

I have shortness of breath but I think I also just breathe super shallow a lot which to me I never notice until my body forces a sharp inhale. My body did that like 5 times last night when I was trying to go to bed. Every morning, barely any air in my lungs even with deep breathing, every night my body forces sharp inhales.

Its frustrating because I genuinely dont know anyone who has to worry about breathing as much as I personally do besides in forums like these on reddit. I wake up in the morning as normal, feed my cats make the coffee start my work day, & then getting closer to noon I barely feel like Im getting any air into my lungs at all, so then I transfer from my office into my bedroom to suck pills down & lay down to breathe better & finish my work day between my bed & my office, & then laying down at night I stop breathing a lot.

1g9o8kv,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1g9o8kv/i_found_out_my_wife_hired_a_hitman_to_kill_me_so/,"I found out my wife hired a hitman to kill me, so I paid him more. Someone else paid him even more.","It was late at night, and my wife was asleep. With a small table light on, I sat alone downstairs on my laptop, searching well, I'll leave that to your imagination. I heard a slight creak from upstairs, but I'm used to those little creaks. This had been my routine for the last several months.

Our marriage wasn't always like this, but recently we have been drifting apart. She's become distant, and it's like she's just going through the motions. Sex consists of me lying on top while she stares at the ceiling. We are still a young couple in our early thirties, but unlike our friends who stayed together because they had kids, we enjoy our dinner parties and game nights too much. But now, our marriage had become stale, and we were too afraid to be left on the shelf.    

I finally relieved myself, to put it politely. Like every night before, I went through the ritual of deleting my internet browser history. I had no choice, as my wife often uses my laptop to order stuff. As I went to press delete and cleanse my soul, I noticed a site called ""Sinister."" That's strange, I didn't recall ever visiting that site. I clicked on the link and it took me to a dark web forum page. And there is no way my wife's been on here. She's the definition of vanilla.

Against my better judgment, I decided to read the page, and there was a conversation between two usernames, ""Gus,"" the name of our cat, and the other, ""Haystack."" I scrolled through the messages, and my eyes widened in shock. My wife had hired a hitman to kill me.

I slunk into bed beside her. I laid flat on my back, wide awake. Every time she stirred or turned over, I flinched. Should I leave? Should I call the cops? Why does she want me dead? All these thoughts raced through my mind.  

The next morning I was shattered. I didn't sleep at all. How could I after finding out my wife hired a hitman to kill me? We have a routine before work where Alice brews the coffee while I prepare breakfast, usually porridge and fruit. Yes, we are one of those health-freak couples. While we eat breakfast, we rarely converse. Over the years, we've slowly run out of things to say.

Out of the blue, Alice asked, ""What have you got on today?"" I stared at her. She never asks me about my day. Why is she asking now?

I stayed vague. ""Just a lot of meetings."" Alice continued, ""Any important?""

Why is she probing me? Is she looking to inform the hitman to my whereabouts?

""Brad and I have a meeting with the board over the merger,"" I replied.

Alice quietly left the table.

I couldn't concentrate at the board meeting. There's no way my wife, who I exchanged vows with, could have hired a hitman. I was in a nightmare, and I was ready to wake up.

""And the timescales?"" the CEO asked. A round table of suits stared at me. I snapped out of my trance. ""Yes, the timescales are fine,"" I replied.

As I left the board meeting, my business partner Brad caught up to me in the corridor. Brad was a little older and had a speckle of grey in his beard making him distinguished.

""Is everything okay?"" he asked. ""Sorry, I couldn't sleep last night,"" I replied.

Brad smiled, ""Go home, get some rest. You need to be at your best tonight."" ""Tonight?"" I asked. He looked at me funny. ""Yes, our weekly game night. You're hosting.""

With everything going on, I had totally forgotten.  

It was getting late at work. Everyone had left the office floor. I sat anxiously in my cubicle, too afraid to go home. What if the hitman was waiting for me to leave? After all, my wife would have likely informed the hitman of where I worked. A cleaning crew entered the office floor. One guy had a skull tattoo on his arm. Is he here to kill me? I told myself to stop being crazy. I had a game night to host.

I entered the office's underground parking garage. The lights switched on as I walked to my car. I heard footsteps from behind and turned sharply. A security attendant politely nodded. I took a deep breath. If that was the hitman, I would already be dead. I would never have seen it coming.

On my journey home, I kept glancing in my rear-view. An SUV was keeping its distance. Up ahead, the stop light turned red, and I was forced to slow down. The SUV pulled up beside me at the lights. I looked across but couldn't see anyone through the blacked-out windows. My heart was pounding. The light turned green, and the SUV drove off in another direction.

Back at home, we hosted our game night with two other couples. One couple was Allen and Jules, who always told stories of their latest wine tasting weekends. They were incredibly superficial, but that's why we liked them. And then there was Brad and his devoted wife Cara, who weren't drinking tonight. They were going through their third IVF cycle.

My wife chose the adult game ""Bad Choices,"" which was ironic as it's designed to find out your darkest secrets. I somehow managed to keep my composure during the game. Everyone enjoyed the questions, giving silly answers. Alice was the life and soul of the party. How can she act so sociable after what she's done? Did I even know her?

It was my turn, and I decided this was the perfect opportunity to slip in my own question. Would you ever hire a hitman to kill your significant other? My aim was to get Alice to confess in front of everyone.

As I was about to ask my question, Alice stood up and asked, ""Would anyone like more wine?"" Jules quipped, ""Do you have a 1920 Bual?"" Allen looked at Alice. ""He's such a bitch."" Everyone laughed.

Alice went into the kitchen, and Brad joined her. ""I'll help you pour.""

A few minutes later they arrived back, and Brad is drinking a glass of wine. Cara looked down and sipped her water. I took a deep sigh and asked a question on the card. ""Have you ever looked through your spouse's phone?"" Everyone put their hands up.  

After the couples finally left, I waited for my wife to go to bed. I went back on the dark web forum. I still wasn't convinced my wife ordered the hit. What if it was just a fantasy? That would be disturbing, but at least my life wouldn't be in danger. I scrolled through the rest of the forum and saw dozens of spouses ordering hits. At what point did their love go rotten?

I re-read my wife's chilling conversation with the hitman. There was no doubt she had ordered my death. It was like I was nothing more than a bug waiting to be zapped. I violently hurled into my waste paper bin. I wiped the vomit from my mouth and reached for my cell to call the cops. I couldn't make the call. Even though my wife despised me, I couldn't bear for her to spend the rest of her life behind bars.

Okay, there must be another way. Maybe I could get the hitman to call it off. I set up a new profile and messaged the hitman asking to meet. I stared at the screen, awaiting a response. I had no idea how long it takes hitmen to reply.

A few minutes later, a message appeared from the hitman. ""Why?"" I quickly typed, ""I need you to take special care of my wife."" Yes, I know I'm incriminating myself, but it was the only way to get the hitman to agree to meet me. The hitman answered, ""Seal's tonight.""

It was now 1 am. I snuck out of the house and drove to Seal's bar, which was located by the docks. I glanced out of my window as I passed the dark waters. I arrived and parked close to the entrance, just in case I needed to make a quick getaway. I tentatively entered the dive bar. Every fiber of my being was screaming at me to leave. The bar was nearly empty, with only a handful of unsavory characters hunched over their drinks. They all looked capable of killing a man. One already had.

I ordered two beers and sat alone at a table near the back of the bar. I took a sip of beer, but my hands were trembling so much I spilt it down my shirt. I waited for over half an hour. This is batshit crazy, I thought. As I got up to leave, a tall, thin, middle-aged guy with long, greasy hair swiveled the chair in front of me and sat backward on it. His hawk eyes pointed to one of the beers. ""Mine?"" I struggled to speak and just nodded.

The hitman took a long swig of beer. ""Are you a cop?"" he asked. Before I could answer, he sniggered, exposing his rotten meth teeth. ""Cops don't waste beer.""

I realized he had been studying my every move since I arrived.

An awkward silence. ""I found a message,"" I stuttered. ""Let me guess, you want me to stop the contract?"" he interrupted. ""Yes, how did you know?"" I enquired. ""Gus has the same IP address,"" he replied.

How stupid of me, I should've used a VPN. In my defense, I am running on fumes.

I took a deep swallow. ""It's been a misunderstanding.""

The hitman casually lit up a cigarette. He seemed so at home like he's had this exact same encounter before.

""She's already paid,"" he said. ""I can pay you more,"" I blurted out.

He leaned in close and spoke in a hushed tone. ""Money isn't the only reason I'm in this line of work.""

His words shocked me to my very core. He stood up. I panicked.

""I can pay you more to kill my wife!""

I couldn't believe what I had just done. If someone had told me a few days ago that I would order a hit on my wife, I would have had them sectioned.

Old school, the hitman wrote a figure on a piece of paper along with his offshore bank account details and slid it across the table. ""Twenty-four hours,"" he stated. I watched him leave the bar and flick his cigarette to the ground.  

That weekend, something odd happened between myself and Alice. We were being nice to each other. It seemed we both felt guilty for hiring a hitman. As we were doing our mundane household chores, Alice suggested, ""Why don't we go out to eat?""

I was taken aback by her request. We hadn't gone out for dinner in over six months.

""Where?"" I asked. ""Donatello's,"" she replied.

I smiled. ""Our first date."" Alice smiled back. ""I remember.""

My heart sank. Was this her way of saying goodbye? Or even worse, is she setting up a time and location for the hitman? How could she be so callous as to choose the place where we fell in love? Little does she know, she's the one in danger.

I played along. ""Sounds good.""

Later that evening, we arrived outside Donatello's in an Uber. Wearing a sports jacket, I opened the door for Alice, who wore a beautiful evening dress. Yes, even though I ordered a hit on my wife, I'm still a gentleman. At dinner, in the charming Italian pizzeria, our conversations were stilted.

""You look tired,"" Alice said. ""It's been a long week,"" I replied.

That was the understatement of the decade.

As the meal unfolded, we started to chat like old times. I could feel a spark between us. It was most likely the flowing wine, but we always did have chemistry. I could sense she wanted to tell me something.

I asked her, ""It feels like you've been somewhere else?""

She looked at me but before she could answer the waiter arrived with our bill. I paid and left a hundred buck tip.

Alice laughed. ""You always did over-tip. That's what I liked about you on our first date."" I laughed. ""Was that all?""

Our laughter soon petered out.  

It was dark outside. We left the restaurant, and our Uber pulled up. From a shadowy alleyway, a tall, thin man wearing a hoodie approached us and reached into his pocket. I panicked. Is the hit on my wife happening right now?

I grabbed Alice's arm and yanked her toward the Uber.

""What are you doing?"" she cried out.

I glanced behind at the hooded man who took out his cell and kept walking.

In the back seat of the Uber, Alice stared at me in disbelief. ""What the hell was that?"" I couldn't answer. My heart was pounding through my chest.

We spent the rest of the journey home in silence. A terrifying thought entered my mind. She was not at all concerned for my safety.  

Over the next few weeks, nothing happened. My wife spent many nights staying with friends and family. Our relationship was non-existence. Every time she left, I dreaded a knock on the door from the cops informing me that they've found her body. What would I say to them? How would I act? I tried acting out the scene in front of the bathroom mirror but I couldn't look at myself.

The guilt and suspense were destroying me. I couldn't eat, sleep, or focus on anything. At work, the merger collapsed, and I was on the verge of losing my job.

I couldn't go on living like this, so I messaged the hitman and arranged another meeting. This time, he told me to meet him at the docks. I had no choice but to agree. I needed to put an end to this.

I arrived at the docks. It was pitch black except for the moonlight shining off the water. With my cell torch, I walked slowly through the maze of shipping containers. What if the hitman lured me here to kill me? After all the best way to never get caught is to get rid of any evidence. A gust of wind shot through me.

""It's getting choppy out here,"" the hitman called out.

He appeared from behind a container, and we stood face to face. It was different meeting him here as opposed to the bar. Although he was relaxed, there was something threatening about him.

""I need you to call off the hit,"" I said firmly.

The hitman smirked. ""Even though she wants you dead?"" I closed my eyes, the pain too much to bear. ""Yes, even though she wants me dead.""

The hitman sighed. ""There's a slight problem. Someone else paid me more.""

He removed his gun from its holster and aimed it at my chest. I stood there shell-shocked. ""We had a deal!"" ""You were okay when I broke your wife's deal,"" he quipped.

I felt like such a fool. Who in their right mind trusts a hitman off the dark web?

I cried out in desperation. ""I can pay you more!"" The hitman lowered his gun slightly. ""I'll pay anything!"" I pleaded.

The hitman placed his gun back into its holster. I thought about running, but I was frozen to the spot. He wrote down a number on a piece of paper and gave it to me. I stared at the ridiculous figure. There is no way on Earth I could pay this. The hitman didn't blink. He was deadly serious.

""Twenty-four hours,"" he stated. ""I'll throw in the guy for free.""

""No one dies,"" I exclaimed.

The hitman walked away. ""What's his name?"" I shouted out. The hitman continued to walk away. ""Speak to your loving wife.""

I was left alone and confused with a life-and-death bill I could not afford.

Back at home, I desperately tried to find ways to pay the hitman. My life depended on it. I attempted to take out large loans with several banks, but they refused to lend me the money. Was there anything I could sell? I had a collection of watches, but that wouldn't come close. I even resorted to putting my kidney up for auction on the dark web, but the offers were either too low or too weird.

At the same time, my mind was wandering. Who is the guy that paid the hitman more? How is he linked to my wife?

I only had one option, and that was to get the guy to call off the hit. But that would mean I would have to speak to my wife. Something I had dreaded since that fateful night.

A nervous wreck, I sat my wife down on the couch and looked into her eyes. I was about to find out the truth. Why did she order a hitman to kill me? But before I could speak, Alice burst into floods of tears.

""I've been seeing someone,"" she wept.

I stared at her in disbelief. Somehow, this betrayal felt worse than the hitman.

I remained calm. ""Who is it?"" She wiped away her tears. ""Brad."" ""How long?"" I asked. ""A few months,"" she replied.

The affair made perfect sense. It tied in with Alice becoming distant and the cracks appearing between Brad and his wife at the game night.

It must have been Brad who took out the hit. My wife would have enquired to the hitman as to why I was still alive. After finding out she's the target by my hands, she had no choice but to confide in Brad. Or maybe they were in it together from the beginning to get me out of the way. Out of desperation to save his lover, he agreed to pay more.

I somehow managed to keep my composure. Alice continued her confession. ""We met at this shitty bar by the docks.""

At that exact moment, I realized I had been extorted. My wife never placed a hit on me. She's never even been on the dark web. The hitman was a con artist who witnessed my wife's shady encounter with Brad. By eavesdropping, he gathered enough info to set up a fake hit. He even used our cat's name Gus as my wife's username.

The hitman preyed on me finding out about the affair and the idea they would conspire to get rid of me. If Alice hadn't mentioned that she met Brad at Seal's, I could have ended up losing everything.

Alice placed her hand on mine. ""Can you forgive me?""

I had a deep pit in my stomach. She may have had an affair, but I hired a hitman to kill her. ""We'll get through this,"" I replied.

We exchanged a tight hug.  

Our lives slowly got back to normal. My wife will never know what I did, but I still have to live with it every day. I searched the dark web forum to retrieve the money stolen by the hitman, but his username and messages were deleted. I even ventured back to Seal's, but he was long gone. It was like he never existed. I could never go to the cops. I would get a life sentence for what I've done. There is one good thing that the hitman gave us.

I got some Aegopsis Bolboceridus couples recently, there doesn't seem to be much info on this species, and I'm trying to breed them. They're copulating, but the females mostly wander around the surface of their enclosure, so I suspect they aren't laying eggs. I'm using compost and leaf litter for substrate. The compost was made with plant peels and remains, coffee grounds, tea leaves and other plant-based organic materials, it's around a year old with a couple of organic material introduced about a month or two ago.

My goal is to get these couples to lay eggs, hatch them into larvae and care for the pupae until their adult form and repeat. I'm new to beetle breeding, never cared for couples, eggs, larvae nor pupae. I'd like some guidelines for this species or approaches I may adopt from the care guides for other species.

Any tips, suggestions and whatever you can tell me about beetle breeding is very welcome and I'll be asking for opinions and sharing the progress with this breeding attempt.

I have been diagnosed with ADHD combined type roughly over a month ago and started titration of 30mg of Elvanse. As everyone’s experience that I have read on here was great. Lots of motivation,desire to get up and start the day. Over a few days to a week I was able to clean my house, finish the DIY work that has been unfinished for months in my bedroom. 

But then it started to go down hill, but not drastically such as symptoms but I noticed that the medication does nowhere last 12/13 hours a day. I would take it in the morning, with a protein breakfast shabang and still last me around 5 hours or so until I start to crash. I would become tired and very yawny and have a slight headache. But that would be all my symptoms on 30mg.

I had a review around just a week ago with the clinician and told her all my symptoms. She upped my dosage to 50mg. Now let me tell you with 50mg. I can feel it working, same as I did with 30mg. Probably the same feeling everyone new who starts medication, however now with 50mg my symptoms probably started to become worse and I am not sure why. I start getting a very weird feeling in my face and head such as my head become warm like flushing symptoms. I get this pressure type feeling in my face/head and pressure on my eyes and sometimes my vision becomes blurry. This would last roughly 30 mins or so until it disappears and then I would get a headache around the evening time.

In terms of ADHD symptoms, I don’t feel that I am able to concentrate due to all this going on. I still feel restless whilst sitting, and I space out and day-dream. I still lose focus in conversations, so pretty much my ADHD symptoms are there but symptoms from the meds got worse.

I’m not sure if it’s just been some bad days because there has been days where I have taken it on an empty stomache and only snacked until after maybe 5 even 8 hours until I had food. So maybe lack of food? But I always remember to drink water and do not drink coffee or redbulls because that’s what kept me going before the meds.

I’m not sure if this is high blood pressure because I don’t usually have any issues with that. I have checked it today and it was slightly on the border of stage 1 but not over,
So unsure if I had it high at any stages I was experiencing the issues with my eyes and head. 

Sorry if now at the end of this I’m rambling, but this is my 3rd attempt in trying to write this as I have been getting distracted. As you can tell the medication is no longer working haha.",2,1729618735.0,ADHDUK,2,1.0,False

**WHAT I WANT:**

I'm trying to achieve a gift system, where giving someone something would achieve different effects and dialogue options. I want it so that these gifts are selectable at any time, but if you aren't in the presence of a certain character, nothing happens and you go back to gameplay. Meanwhile, if you are in a character's presence, they talk about the item you show them.

**WHAT I HAVE:**

This script is a combination from a tutorial I watched on youtube and a reply I read on here. For the record, I've never coded before.

This part is located in a custom file called customscreen.rpy:

    screen hud():
        modal False
    
        imagebutton auto ""bg_hud_inventory_%s.png"":
            focus_mask True 
            hovered SetVariable(""screen_tooltip"", ""Inventory"")
            unhovered SetVariable(""screen_tooltip"", """")
            action Show(""inventory""), Hide(""hud"")
    
    
    screen inventory():
        add ""bg_inventoryscreen"" zoom 2.0
        modal True
    
        vbox:
            pos 0.2, 0.10 
            for item in inventory.items:
                add ""[item.icon]"" zoom 0.3 pos -0.4, 0.6
                textbutton ""[item.name]\n"" style ""inventory_text"" action Function (item_use, item) pos 0.3, 0.1
    
        imagebutton auto ""inventoryscreen_return_%s.png"":
            focus_mask True
            hovered SetVariable(""screen_tooltip"", ""Return"")
            unhovered SetVariable(""screen_tooltip"", """")
            action Hide(""inventory""), Show(""hud"")

This part is located in a custom file called item.rpy, which is the only programming choice I made all on my own. If it absolutely needs to be in the script, let me know.

    init python:
    
        class Inventory():
            def __init__(self, items, no_of_items):
                self.items = items
                self.no_of_items = no_of_items
    
            def add_item(self, item):
                self.items.append(item)
                self.no_of_items += 1
    
            def remove_item(self, item):
                self.items.remove(item)
                self.no_of_items -= 1
    
            def list_items(self):
                if len(self.items) < 1:
                    guy.c(""My pockets are empty."")
                else:
                    guy.c (""Let's see..."")
                    for item in self.items:
                        guy.c(f""{item.name}. {item.description}"")
    
    
        class InventoryItem():
            def __init__(self, name, description, icon):
                 = name
                self.description = description
                self.icon = icon 
    
        def item_use(item):
            if item == donut:
                pass
            if item == coffee:
                pass
            if item == hotchoc:
                pass
            if item == tea:
                pass
    
    
    define donut = InventoryItem(""A donut"", ""Frosted with sprinkles."", ""images/donut.png"")
    define coffee = InventoryItem(""Coffee"", ""Would make me go fast."", ""images/coffee.png"")
    define hotchoc = InventoryItem(""Hot Chocolate"", ""Love the chocolate, hate the hot."", ""images/hotchoc.png"")
    define tea = InventoryItem(""Tea"", ""Idk what kind."", ""images/tea.png"")

Most of this works, except for the textbutton parts. I tried something like this with them:

        def item_use(item):
            if item == donut:
                guy.c(""No, I shouldn't."")

And the game broke and said I wasn't allowed to do two sequences at once,  or something like that. If you want more details just ask and I'll try to recreate the error. I think the textbuttons work in theory, I just don't know how to use them properly.

My first idea was to have some else/if tags to determine who the player was talking to and jump to the appropriate scene involving that item, but when I tried to put the jump function under the if item code you see above, it didn't work. I tried putting it in the script file too but that also didn't work. 

The problem with that idea is that I'm planning on there being like 50 or so items in total, so having several jump functions under all of them seems long and unnessicary. If it exists, I'd like if during a scene, I could just place what items trigger a special reaction and set any other items as a default ""I have nothing to say about that."" 

So, is there an easier way to do this or should I just try to get the jump functions working? Do you need more information or a better explanation? Or is the code itself the problem? ",2,1729618367.0,RenPy,1,1.0,False

My OB is so wonderful and she really listens to me. That said, it still took 12 weeks to get properly medicated in my last pregnancy. I am 8w4d and last week started 4mg zofran 2-3x daily, and Reglan 4x daily, Unisom & B6. This combo worked last time but this time I am much sicker, and sooner. 

It is extremely difficult to care for my toddler or do my job and I am primary parent and breadwinner. I am rated as moderate to severe on the HER quiz, despite not vomiting. I can not drink water. I am drinking 16oz of liquid IV a day, and maybe 16oz of water/coffee/tea/juice whatever sounds remotely doable at the time. I am desperate for more help this time around. 

I want to ask/push for outpatient IV. *However,* the largest supplier of IV fluids in the country, (Baxter) supplies 70% of IV fluids and their manufacturing plant is in Asheville, NC... the hurricane shut it down. To the point surgeries are being cancelled. Now, I understand that I am not vomiting up fluids, but I am not consuming fluids. How can I express this in a way that legitimizes my need for scarce fluids. Has anyone recently been denied? 

What else would you think is beneficial? I am considering asking for Diclegis, but concerned that will make me even more tired. 

I have an autoimmune disease and the dehydration is causing me to experience painful flares (AS).

Hey there, I have two beautiful 7 foot long & 1.5 -2 feet wide maple slabs that I’m struggling to put together a modern 3.5-4 foot long coffee table design. 

As both slabs are pretty beautiful by themselves I’d feel guilty removing the live edge so my first initial thought was leaving the live edge and utilizing the second slab to create two solid 1.5 foot tall slabs to use as the legs of the table. After cleaning the edges of the smaller slabs and cutting their widths to be less than the width of the table I’d bevel the angels slightly outwards and place them parallel from one another recessed from the edges of the table. I would hope this would give it a more modern look, but many friends think it would give off log cabin vibes. 

How would you use these Maple slabs in a coffee table to ensure the table is classy while maximizing the character of the wood? 

One of my design buddies suggested two black metal square figured legs would be best for a modern look with a live top, but I’m not completely sold on that. Just want to see if there is a design approach that I’m overlooking. ",1,1729618020.0,woodworking,0,1.0,False

What should I do now? Pls help:'),"Here's a bit of context: I regretted not joining a sorority during the Fall 2024 recruitment or at least trying to do so. A couple of weeks pass (close to a month) and I'm on Instagram and notice a sorority that I was interested in made a story post to fill out their ""interest form"". I had this gut feeling to just go ahead and fill it out- everything in me said to just do it, and I did! I didn't think anything would come of it as I thought it was just about being in the loop about their events, sorority, etc. 

About a week went by and I got a text message yesterday (Monday) from the President of the sorority. They said that they, along with their sisters, liked my vibe and would like to get to know me better and see if I was interested in potentially joining. They also said that they would like to schedule me on a coffee date with one of their sisters this week, along with asking me to fill out a form. After hearing this I was stocked!

The form wasn't working, but that didn't stop me from wanting to join of course! I replied back to them saying that I was so interested and that the form was not working. They replied stating that they would get on to fixing the form, and asked me when I would be available this week. I said I was available all day Friday, and they replied saying that they would let me know. I also made another mention of the form and said, ""oh btw, if you still want me to fill out that form lmk when it gets fixed. thxs againnn"".

It's now Tuesday, only one day since they've reached out, and I'm high-key freaking out. I'm afraid that I'm going to lose the opportunity to meet someone and have a chance at joining the sorority! 

So my question is what should I do? Should I reach back out to ask about the form? Should I tell them that I'm also available on Thursday (which I am and just figured out after the fact last night lol) and would still like to meet? Or do you think I should give it a bit more time? 

I know I sound kinda ""needy"", or persistent and high-key annoying about all this, but I really want to give it a try! I don't want to have any regrets when I graduate and it looks like such a great way to make friends and be surrounded by a community of beautiful people.

My exact other half. We started talking and hit it off instantly, had a few dates and things seemed to be going really well. 

Yesterday they told me a time that they would be in town to meet me (they live out of town) two hours later I hear that they slept in. It's all good, it happens. But when they finally got here we hung out for half an hour before they had to go see their daughter. I had texted that I couldn't wait to watch the meteor shower and cook dinner for us. 

When they finally came back to meet me they had already eaten and very nonchalantly asked if I had dinner. I hadn't eaten because I was waiting for them. 

I tried to explain my feelings, I'm not mad at them but it feels disrespectful. I tried to explain myself and they didn't want to talk about feelings simply saying they don't like it when people are mad at them. 

I had an appointment this morning, we walked across town and they said they would wait for me at the coffee shop. I came out of my appointment, texted then called them. No answer. I went to the coffee shop and they weren't there. So I walked back across town alone and now I'm doing laundry. 

They're supposed to spend another night but part of me wants to just tell them to get their shit out of my apartment. I'm trying to see if a friend is around today since my date isn't being reliable. 

I'm not sure what to do. 

Frankly I feel hurt and it has to do with me being naive and gullible. I believe people when they tell me things, I thought we had agreed to delete Tinder. Seen they still had the app on their phone. They assured me they aren't using it, I believe them, but we agreed to delete it and they didn't. I don't know what to believe and I'm not sure how I feel about trusting them.

As a male, I have feelings and I'm allowed to have those feelings. I think they're valid, as I think it's fair to talk about feelings. 

I feel disrespected and maybe a bit taken advantage of. I really built them up in my mind, I still want to give them the benefit of the doubt but I also feel like a fool. I don't know if I'm being played, I don't know a lot of things, they have ADD and among other diagnosed things as well. Neither of us is perfect, but I thought they were perfect for me. But I'm not so sure.

I'm kicking my own ass and feeling conflicted and it comes down to feeling naive and gullible. I feel like I'm too clueless to date and it's my fault for always finding myself alone. Why is it so difficult to find dependability? I just want one person to understand me and see worth in me, I thought I found it but I'm not sure. 

I honestly don't even know what I'm looking for in making this post. Does anyone else feel this way? 

I'm in a precarious housing situation and was really hopeful this would work as a possible live in situation would really help. But I'm having my doubts. 

I just don't know anymore.

[What if the Urban Myths \(korean horror drama\) toothworms zombies broke out of the dentists offices and overrun the cities?](https://preview.redd.it/s3r8uyr47cwd1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a01113d52d1bab231db20e0d12b0777a1f390e9)

In 2016, this scenario became reality. The infection, classified as the Toothworm Rabies, first emerged in Robloxity, New Bloxx, January 20th-March 5. Some of the first signs of its spread were noticed at a dental office in the Urban parts of the city,  Robloxian Research for Parasites and Phenomenons (RRFPP) expert Professor Carl remarks that the location provides an excellent subject for the Tooth Worms. Here, its deadly symptoms were observed in one of the patients who was complaining about gum pains from the worms and two other dentists whom he infected. An additional fourteen dentists also went missing or ended up infected due to infected-related attacks which resulted in the cops exterminating those who winded up infected, The second sign of spread was at a condiment factory, Despite warnings by Prof, Carl to contain the parasitic outbreak through drastic measures, Robloxia's role in international condiment and drinking bevrages distribution caused contaminated edible products such as beer, fruit juice/punch, coffee, ketchup, maple syrup, butter, cream cheese, honey and jam to be distributed internationally, hitting shelves in Robloxity on Thursday, January 21st. It reached a state of pandemic when people (ROBLOXians) who consumed enough of the contaminated products over the following day soon became infected and began to be admitted en-masse to emergency rooms, quickly overwhelming hospitals in the process. Soon the eggs laid by the toothworms began hatching out more toothworms and influencing its infected host's behavior to kill the host and reanimate the host as men and women eating zombies, and as the usual zombie, start violently attacking people and try spreading it to others via biting, cannibalism, scratching and contact through bodily fluids.  

**Two days later durring the mass citywide to worldwide spread scale**



In Robloxity, the outbreak manifested on January 30th, with large numbers of the Tooth Worm Zombies attacking, eating either the flesh, face, organs, eyes, biting or killing many uninfected people running for their lives around them reanimating them as them. By the early hours of September 27, the United States of Robloxia government declared a state of national emergency and mobilized the national guard and the troops of the military, with the support of local enforcement and CDC scientists, to halt the spread of the infection.



Outside of the area the military blocked the interstate freeways, outer roads and national/state highways leading away from the city and set up a base for residents to flee to for refuge. Much of the city erupted into chaos; police cars rushed to various areas around the city, setting up roadblocks to contain citizens who were bitten, only for the toothworm zombies to overrun them and bite or eat them more before even finish turning. Rioting and Looting occuring around Downtown, with people stealing various items such as food, water, money, entertainment devices and medicine, Gas leaks spread in the city as mega hordes of toothworm zombies caused various tankers to flip over or both normal and zombies destroy gas, petrol, propane and disel tanks or pumps, causing explosions which set the buildings ablaze and making some collapse, Car, Truck, Bus and bike crash accidents occuring all over the streets killing some passengers depending on the seat ammounts, At least seven passenger airliners made emergency takeoffs from Keyon Air International Airport and flew as high above over the city, with a zombie who was on one of them attacked all passengers and pilots, making the plane banking steeply upwards before front diving mid-air and crashing down into and destroying half of an entire neighborhood and wrecking an entire interstate freeway overpass.

By Feburarary 1, the infected broke through the walls and made chaos on neighboring cities, such as Bloxburg, Brookhaven, Pacifico, MadCity and RoVille (from RoCitizens) reaching a national scale, eventually overunning the international border checkpoints, spreading to other nations such as the Republic of Minecraft and the Republic of Legoville



By March 5, only towns and the countryside lacked a high infected presence. Military officials sent out soldiers to these areas to retrieve the residents living there and escort them to the safe areas in the cities they created to prevent these areas falling to the infection. In Robloxity, the military rounded up the town's citizens for evacuation to nearby , where yoyle soldiers had established a safe zone. However, after it was found that there was some evacuees bitten and turning into zombies, the soldiers executed all of the infected evacuees and left their bodies in a mass grave in a field outside of Robloxity.

I am struggling to find a lot of info on Cacao online though. I just have a few questions I wanted to dump on the subreddit and get some feedback on.

  
1. Is Navitas a good brand? Or at least good enough? It is very cheap at costco so it's what I have on hand right now.

2. How much should I be taking? The first time I took it I did 25g for a meditation/ceremonial dose, it was really nice and calming and got me in a good headspace. A few days later I tried 35 and didn't really notice much. But now I have been thinking about just doing like 10g as a boost for work (I am not really a coffee drinker), is 10g okay to do daily or every other day?

3. Is there a tolerance involved like with coffee or other things? Will I eventually need to increase my dose?

4. Is there a better way to go about this than what I described?

5. Is there any other herbs or anything that go well with it to increase certain effects/benefits?

  
Sorry for the dump, just trying to get a better idea of it. So far the one time I took it for work my focus was maxed out and I wasn't jittery like with coffee. Probably won't do it every day but definitely might consider it on days that I need a boost.",2,1729617554.0,Cacao,0,1.0,False

As a big snacker (who is also v physically active, and in shape) I believe this to be my hardest challenge ahead of starting so thought I better practice:

> Breakfast, snack & tea 9:30-10:15

> Lunch, snack & coffee 1:45 - 2:30

>Snack, tea 6:00:6:15

>Dinner, desert, 8:00:8:45

Obviously all of this would include brushing, flossing, etc. Does this sound a reasonable schedule? And time without the aligners in?

1g9ncq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1g9ncq8/hot_chocolate/,Hot Chocolate ,"That day. That perfect, yet almost just as horrifying, day. The warm, homely feel of the café springs into John’s mind. The homely feel and its welcoming environment soothe his anxieties. Yet, somewhat tragically, this café is about as far from home as possible. The abrasive and aggressive cries and sounds from the traffic outside, muffled and softened by the holy ambience of the café. The sign above the café read “LE CAFÉ DE LA MER”. Were the owners even French? Nah, probably just another gimmick to sell overpriced coffee. The hot chocolate on the other hand? Heavenly. Almost no other shop could replicate its iconic and mellow taste. However it was this same hot chocolate that would continue to haunt John’s mind. It wasn’t like the drink caused him any grief, but rather, it reminded him of it. Pedestrians would occasionally peer in through the shop’s windows, or look inebriated by the café’s divine aroma. The generic, upbeat melody of its radio, the kind and hospitable employees brewing fresh shots of espresso. The café’s TV plays a foreboding broadcast talking about a car accident, but none of that really mattered to John yet. The discrete rippling of the coffee drops emptying into the ceramic vessel. The gentle sunlight oozes through the double glazed window of the café. A worker steams a pot of milk, simultaneously dusting a clear glass with cocoa powder. He gently presses a bottle filled to the brim with chocolate syrup, and tips the bottle into the glasses, drenching its edges. A high-pitched squeal is emitted from the milk steamer, almost like a foreboding alarm to warn the worker his time to brew has arrived. The employee carefully pours the steamy milk into the glass, and brings it to the counter.

“Order 12!” Shouted the worker. His eyebrows and eyes likewise widened as he shouted the order. He had clearly been working a long shift, as there were splashes of what looked like espresso scattered on his face. His hazelnut, brown long hair had some obviously accidental curls and frizzes in them. He repeated himself once more, as if the café never even heard him. “A Hot Chocolate with extra marshmallows and extra whipped cream; Order 12!” The words echoed in John’s head. He slowly approached the register.  “That’s me” The worker had to avert his eyes from the atrium of the café, as he peered over the counter, 2 feet below the ground. Before him, stand a young boy, approximately the age of around 8-12. He couldn’t be any older than a 5th class student in primary school, and very obviously he was as implied by his backpack littered with pins and stickers. The barista lowered his tone as he gently handed the boy his drink. “Here you go buddy. Need anything els-” “I’m Fine.” The boy interrupted. “O-oh, ok…” The worker sheepishly responded. 

The boy sassily grabbed the drink suddenly out of the barista’s hand, but he would pay his retribution for this attitude. His hand recoiled, as he felt the consequences for touching a hot beverage without proper precaution. The cup lay victim to the force of gravity, as it descended pathetically onto the floor, accompanied by a fitting SHATTER!. Ceramic pieces flew and skidded around the floor. All of a sudden, the atmosphere thickened. The bubbly, cheery ambience of the café immediately dissipated, as the whole shop swivelled their heads, and locked onto the incident. John’s index and middle finger curled in pain as they bore the brunt of the burn. The scorching liquid chocolate spill over John’s beige shoes. His crimson laces soaked in the devilishly sweet concoction. His face turned beet red, his eyes swell with tears. The barista, realising the situation, goes around the counter and comforts the boiled boy. “It’s alright kid. We’ll make you another one on the house, and we’ll get this all cleared up” “Really?” The boy inquired with a glimmer of hope sparking in his eyes. “Yeah, of course,” The barista assured. The worker cleared up the mess and brought a mop to further decontaminate the area. 

John’s old smile started to crawl back up the sides of his cheek again, until he snapped back to reality. He was reminded of the reason he came to the café in the first place. His mother! Of course, he was waiting to go for a day out with his mother. His father had dropped him off at the café a few minutes prior, but he had been kept waiting for so long he had decided to order a drink before his mother came. Where was she? John’s dad even gave him a rose, (his mother’s favourite flower) to gift her as a surprise. Why hadn’t she arrived yet? The piercing metallic ring of the door’s jingle bells rang as John compiled his thoughts. ‘It must be Mum!’ He rejoiced as he turned to the glass door, but he didn’t see his mother. Instead, 2 intimidating figures, a man and a woman, dressed in hi-vis jackets entered the shop. They had depressing grimaces on their faces as they bee-lined towards John’s direction. “Are you John Jones?” The woman asked. The boy rapidly shook his head up and down. “I’m sorry kid, I don’t know how to tell you this, but earlier today, your mother-”

John shot up from his bed. ‘The same old nightmare, really?’ he complained. He wiped the sweat off his forehead as he silenced the piercing melody of his alarm clock. He did a double take towards his alarm clock as he realised- ‘I’m late again?!’He darted to the bathroom to brush his teeth and wash up. He threw on his barista outfit and flew down the stairs. Before he left, he peeked down the door of the living room. He lay mesmerised at an old photo, appearing to be a decade or so old. While the photo itself was degrading, the frame and the pedestal it was placed on was well kept and spotless. A vase with a single rose lay dormant before the frame. “I’ll be off mum, and don’t worry, I’ll tell you all about this new job once I get back!” John darted out the front door and down the block. The traffic was as loud and annoying as it always had been. It didn’t take long for him to reach his destination. He came to an abrupt stop in front of a building, and sighed. He glared intently at the sign that loomed over the humble shop. “LE CAFÉ DE LA MER” John took a deep breath, and entered the coffee shop. The all too familiar ringing of the shop’s welcome bells, the enchanting smell of croissants, and every other pastry that could bless your tastebuds. The luring whiff of coffee beans, and the warm amiable environment.
John walked towards the counter, smiling. “Hi there, I’m here for the barista job? I’m pretty sure your manager passed me in each of the interview stages.” The barista looked John up and down, acting as if he had just seen a ghost. He swept aside his long, brown hair as he got a better look at John. “Yeah, he told us about you coming in today. You ready for your first day?” John looked slightly apprehensive, but nodded reluctantly. “Yeah, ready when you are.” The barista brought John to one of the platforms in which the drinks were made. “I’ll teach  you the basics with a few easy drinks” The barista explained. “The first drink I’m gonna teach you,” The barista began to explain. “-is the hot chocolate.”

I initially purchased the Bose QC Earbuds (the 2024 model that came out recently) because I was looking for comfort and I can appreciate the excellent noise cancelling. My primary use is coffee shops, libraries, the gym, and walking outside. I have high-quality headphones options for other scenarios.

I ended up returning them and bought the Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 4 Earbuds, which I’m keeping.

Here are my ratings:

Bose QuietComfort Earbuds

- Comfort: 7.5. They were comfortable, but less so than, say, Apple AirPods.
- Sound quality: 6.5. I’m not sure they were much better than AirPods. The sound quality was a bit meh, with weird mid and highs even when equalized. I’d say, good enough for anyone who hasn’t had access to high-end headphones before, but if you’re a bit of an audiophile, I can’t see you being happy with how thin they sounded. Fine for the gym, though.
- ANC: 10. Unbelievable level of noise cancelling.

All in all, if you are okay with average sound quality, these are hard to beat for the money. They are relatively inexpensive, comfortable, and their noise cancelling is top notch. 

Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 4 Earbuds

- Comfort: 7. I was expecting much worse. It’s actually not far from the Bose ones. It feels like a tighter seal, but not in an uncomfortable way.
- Sound quality: 9. With the personalized audio profile available in the app, these are very impressive sounding considering their size.
- ANC: 7. It works well. Perfectly fine for my needs, but it’s not Bose, that’s for sure.

These are pricier, but I found them to be a much better buy.",3,1729616951.0,headphones,0,1.0,False
1g9ncfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/breville/comments/1g9ncfq/rattling_noises_and_weird_behaviour_from_oracle/,Rattling noises and weird behaviour from Oracle Touch,"Hi,

my Breville (actually Sage) Oracle Touch started to drip a bit from the group head in the last days. I just noticed but didn't think about it, because it was just a few drops. (It's almost 2 years old now)

Today the problems began, I turned it on, it started heating up and sometimes it pumps a bit of water in the boilers (I guess? It pumps just randomly, I guess you know what I mean), but after that there was a very loud buzzing and rattling noise. I ran over and unplugged it. After turning it on again it instantly continued to rattle around, really loud and metallic. I turned it off again and waited some hours.

After some hours I tried again, pulled a shot and everything seemed to be fine and I turned it off.

Now, like 30 mins ago I turned it on, went away and after 10 minutes the steam wand just randomly started to shoot out steam and didn't stop, there wasn't even a coffee selected on the display. I did it and pressed the steam button multiple times to turn it on an off, but nothing happened, steam was still on full blast. Then I turned off the machine and it instantly stopped. Turned it on again and the second I pressed the button, it was on full blast again. After waiting 20 mins to cool off, I turned it on again and now it hat that loud rattling and buzzing noise again.

After some reading I think the solenoid valve is stuck or can not close or something? According to my different problems it seems to affect the steam valve and the drips from the group head might have been unrelated. Also it's a bit weird that turning off the machine instantly stopped the steam, but the steam button did not. (Or the fact, that it wasn't even supposed to deliver steam in the first place.) Are there multiple valves in series?

We have very hard water here in Munich but I'm on the highest filter renewal schedule (selected by the water measure strip) and I'm replacing the filter in the water tank quite often.

Should I try to run 1 or 2 complete descaling cycles (if it lets me without going crazy with the valve again) or should I send it in? I still have around 3 weeks of warranty.",1,1729616949.0,breville,0,1.0,False

1g9nb9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1g9nb9z/question_on_setting_budget_for_baby_shower/,question on setting budget for baby shower,"Just wondering people's opinion on this. We're throwing my sister a baby shower and I brought up the need to set a budget. 

I purposely didn't have any special requests when my mom/sisters threw my shower - it was at my mom's house, they made all the food, we had some decorations and mimosa bar and it was all very lovely (and very reasonable, less than $100/person for the 3 of them).

My sister is inviting more people and my mom's house can't accommodate them all so we're renting a space in a cute coffee shop ($250).

We're planning to bring the brunch food and mimosa bar again, etc. etc. I said I'd like to keep the budget around $500 total. Is it reasonable to not be expected to pay significantly more for their showers than I had them pay for mine? Expenses add up quickly and I already feel like it's a huge gift in itself to throw people a shower (which I am happy to do as they did one for me) but I also feel it's reasonable to set similar budgets between the showers. 

  
Any thoughts on this? What we should have done is discuss a budget for each shower before any of them happened with the caveat that you're welcome to go above and beyond that if you want to pay the difference. I can guarantee neither sister would be having a far more extravagant shower if they were the one paying for it.

I texted my mom/sister my budget proposal and my sister passively aggressively hasn't responded yet so just curious others' thoughts on how to approach this/respond back whenever I hear from them.

 https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/NRqUwQzRLq

I'm 22(F), my ex is 22(M), we've been in a relationship for 6 years. My ex changed the age in the previous post due to personal protection. 

Here I'll tell you my version. The relationship had its beautiful moments in 2018, 2019, 2020. In 2020 we had a long distance relationship. At the end of 2021 we moved in together, the adaptation of living together was complicated, communication was dying transformed into daily arguments. I had an overdose on my part because I couldn't accept what happened. 2022 was a little calmer but the problems continued. 2023 was horrible, lies and deception on both sides. We CHEAT to each other. 

He decided to fight for me.

At the end of 2023, he gave me a promise ring, and in February of this year, I found a diary where he confirmed that he had cheated on me with his ex-best friend. Something in me died that day. I ended the relationship 4-5 months after this. We were still living together.

I started using marijuana daily to deal with the pain of 4 wisdom teeth and the movement in my teeth. I started having psychotic attacks from using so much. 

I convinced myself that my family hated me and that my ex-partner had more women. I distanced myself from everyone and thought they were judging me. After 3 months of the relationship ending, I physically attacked my ex 3 times. I have no excuses, what I did was very wrong. 

After those attacks, I started looking for therapy, I have followed the advice of my psychologist. I had to move because I did not feel comfortable and I was on alert all the time. I continue to seek therapy. 

I continue trying to be better every day. 

Despite so many years in the relationship, we got off on the wrong foot. I had my expectations too high, obscuring reality. There were times when I inconsistently obscured my ex's feelings, and times when I hurt him so he would know how it felt. There was deceit and lies on both sides, in the midst of all that we continued to meet and love each other. We never sought therapy together, I didn't want to or he didn't want to...

I made the decision to leave the state because I'm staying with an aunt, and in this place there is drug use and problems.
I have a cousin who offered me help, he lives in North Carolina. 

I made the decision to leave because everything is confusing. My ex has anxious attachment and has told me twice that he is going to get me pregnant before I leave. He told me that no matter where I go, he should look for me. When he confessed to me that he made a post here on Reddit about the situation, I already knew, I was taking all the blame. 

That night I walked away super frustrated, he asked me for forgiveness.

Here I leave you my part and it is not to hurt him, because deep down I have faith to fix things because I love him and I do not want to lose him. 

I deserve respect, a clear answer. 

It is not okay to ask third parties for ADVICE when they DO NOT know, talk to artificial intelligence to ask for advice???, put on a movie to reflect?????? Speak clearly. 

I need a clear answer. If you can not forgive me, I will understand. Be a clear person and even if it is difficult, you must make difficult decisions for your well-being. The only reason I want to leave is because I feel that my ex has power over me, and he has shown me with mixed signals. 

I love you, but this is not what I want. What I did is already done, and if you are going to point at me and treat me badly every time you talk to me, you will push me further away. If you can not forgive me, I understand and respect that. It is still offensive that you put unknown third parties to give their opinion on a situation in which you play the victim and change the story in your favor. We BOTH were very wrong. 

Talking about pregnancy and sexual comments while we are in this situation makes me feel used. You don't want me for yourself but you don't want to let me go either. I have been with you because you are drowning in a deep depression and even though I try to get close to help you, your words penetrate my heart consecutively. If you know that you cannot forgive me, let me go. Let me start from 0 in a state and learn from my mistakes. I was very immature, and I still have a long way to go to consider myself mature, I am grateful to my aunt but this is not my environment to heal.



I won't lie to you, in my heart I have faith that you are my person. To be your wife and have your children in my womb. But this is not the way, and you are not obligated to be part of my life, I need a clear answer. For now I keep moving away for my well-being and self-love. I look you in the eyes and I still believe that it is you. Let's be clear; let's have a coffee, let's come to a conclusion, it would make me less hurt to know that I HAVE a clear answer.

1g9n87w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/1g9n87w/introverts_and_anxiety_practical_strategies_for/,Introverts and Anxiety: Practical Strategies for Sustainable Wellbeing,"Introverts. Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments. We may enjoy socialising but we recharge by spending time on our own, we often enjoying getting lost in our own thoughts – just enjoying being inside our own heads for a while. We tend to lean toward smaller, close-knit social lives. But let’s clear up a misconception: introversion doesn’t mean we’re anti-social. It just means we are at our best in situations that aren’t overwhelming.


Anxiety. The emotion that warns us when something threatening seems to be just around the corner. In moments of true danger, it can be life-saving: the foresight that there is trouble ahead, and those vital few seconds to get ready for it saved many of our ancient ancestors (while their peers perished – unable to pass on their genes.) That’s one of the factors why we’re here today. But, when anxiety lingers beyond its intended purpose, it becomes not just tiring—it’s exhausting. If this sounds familiar, you’re definitely not alone.

Not all introverts experience anxiety, and you don’t have to be an introvert to struggle with it. But many introverts do. It’s a common combination, and knowing how to navigate it can make all the difference.


Signs You’re an Introvert with Anxiety—which ones do you relate to the most?
1. You Typically Overprepare
You think through worst-case scenarios in detail. It makes you feel more in control—but it can also be draining.
Tip: When you find yourself imagining worst-case outcomes, think about a balanced ""most likely scenario"" scenario too. Give yourself permission to think about the ‘’best case scenario’’ – luck isn’t a good strategy, but take it when you get it! Thinking through these scenarios helps to bring your anxious thoughts back to a more realistic middle ground. This practice doesn’t stop your mind from thinking about risks but it does help add perspective.


2. You Tend to Overthink and Listen to Your Inner Critic
Introverts often have rich inner lives, which can mean their internal dialogue is active—sometimes too active. Anxiety amplifies this, often turning up the volume on self-critical thoughts.
Tip: Develop a ritual for challenging anxious thoughts. When a negative thought comes up, ask yourself: ""Is this thought 100% true?"" Most often, it won’t be. Questioning and even writing down these thoughts can give you some distance from them, reducing their power. If this is an issue for, look up my article ‘From Limitations to Liberation’ – it takes a dive in to tackling limiting beliefs. 


3. You Always Feel the Need to Be Busy
Anxiety often compels you to keep moving (it’s a high energy ‘state’ – one of the reasons it can be so tiring)—constantly doing something. But staying busy can sometimes just mean staying distracted, without actually being effective.
Tip: Replace ""busy"" with ""purposeful."" Each day, set just one or two specific goals that really matter to you. A small amount of focused effort is often more satisfying (and less stressful) than a day spent rushing from one task to the next with no real direction. Ask yourself at least five times a day: ‘what is the most value adding thing (in the context of what your life is about) I could be doing right now?’


4. You Prefer Routines and Struggle When Things Go Off-Plan
Routines give a sense of control, but sometimes they turn into rigid safety nets – sometimes beyond them being value adding. When something unexpected happens, it can trigger deep unease.
Tip: Practice gentle flexibility. Start small: maybe change the route you walk or try a new café. These small ""novelty exercises"" help build resilience for when larger, unexpected changes occur. The key is to show yourself that change, is often manageable. Remember that change is neither good or bad (change can also be for the better). Remember also that we have been ‘programmed’ by our evolution to perceive change as bad: once we transcend that ‘programming’ new avenues of opportunity open up for us.  


5. You Hide Nervousness Behind a Mask
You’ve learned to mask nervousness well, but that doesn’t mean it’s not taking a toll internally.
Tip: Identify trusted people who you can be honest with. Even if it’s just one close friend or a journal entry, letting out what you're feeling helps you process the anxiety instead of holding it all in. Vulnerability is powerful; it connects you to others and often takes the edge off anxiety.


6. You See More Danger Than Others in Everyday Situations
Anxiety primes your mind to be vigilant (and reduces your options – see my article ‘Live the life you choose – expand your Thought-Action Repertoire’), sometimes turning neutral situations into seemingly threatening ones.
Tip: Try reframing the ""threat."" If you’re anxious before a social event, instead of focusing on what could go wrong, set a small, achievable goal for the event—like having a meaningful conversation with one person. Reframing your focus can help your mind move away from perceived threats and toward positive intentions.


7. Perfectionism and People-Pleasing
Perfectionism often stems from a need to feel worthy. Beliefs like “I need everyone to like me to be valuable” create intense anxiety around how you’re perceived.
Tip: Shift from a focus on being liked to being authentic (are you living your life for you or for ‘them’?) Practice saying ""no"" in low-stakes situations. Remember, you’re not responsible for everyone else’s happiness: you are responsible for your well-being (not theirs!) The right people will appreciate your true self more than a perfected (according to who?) version of you.


8. Nerves Sometimes Turn You In to an Over-Talker
Normally, you speak only when you feel confident, but anxiety can shift you into overdrive, where you say too much to fill the silence.
Tip: If you catch yourself over-talking, pause and take a deep breath. Silence can feel awkward, but it’s not a problem. Giving yourself permission to pause helps reduce the pressure to fill every moment with words.


9. Trouble Sleeping
Anxiety makes it hard for your mind to shut off at night, leading to trouble falling asleep, frequent waking, or early rising.
Tip: Create a ""wind-down"" routine. Dedicate the last 30-60 minutes before bed to relaxing, tech-free activities. Reading something light, or writing down your thoughts can help signal your brain that it’s time to rest. Top tips (1) get as cold as you can (reductions in our core body temperatures are a cue to go to sleep) (2) forget the clock telling you it is ‘lights out’ time – read until your eyes close and your head nods.


Moving From Awareness to Action
Being an introvert with anxiety can feel overwhelming at times, but it’s also something you can learn to manage with care and practice. Anxiety may not disappear overnight, but you can make shifts that help it lose its hold on your everyday life. You’re not alone. Many of us walk this path, learning how to balance the gifts and challenges of introversion and anxiety. Keep being gentle with yourself—there’s strength in softness.


Practical Strategies for Thriving as an Introvert

1.	Create and Protect Your Recharge Time
For us introverts, alone time is essential for recharging. Make it non-negotiable. Whether it’s 30 minutes in the morning or a quiet evening ritual, schedule time just for yourself. Communicate this need with those around you—it’s a matter of maintaining your well-being, not just a preference.


2.	Leverage Your Strengths in One-on-One or Small Group Interactions
We tend to excel in deeper, more intimate conversations. Rather than pushing yourself to thrive in large social gatherings, seek out or create opportunities for one-on-one or small group interactions. You could host a dinner with close friends, or meet up individually for coffee. Cultivate the type of social life that aligns with your strengths.


3.	Prepare and Plan for Social Situations
One of the best tools for introverts is preparation. If you have a social event or a work meeting coming up, prepare conversation topics, questions, or think about what you hope to get from the interaction. This doesn’t mean scripting everything, but it does mean having some mental prompts to feel more comfortable and confident. You don’t even have to say much: a few thoughtful questions can go a long way.


4.	Create a Space at Home that Grounds You
Set up a specific space in your home where you feel completely relaxed—this could be a reading nook, a meditation corner, or even just a comfy chair by a window. Use this space to do whatever helps you feel grounded, such as journaling, reading, or simply sitting in silence. Having a dedicated spot to return to helps to re-centre yourself, especially after having been with people.


5.	Harness Your Listening Superpower
Introverts are often strong listeners, and this can be a powerful skill in both social and work settings. Make it a habit to ask thoughtful questions and really listen—this not only helps you navigate social settings more comfortably, but also makes people value your presence. Remember, quality over quantity is where you shine.

I had been in the area outside of and through DC previously but not really explored, and I finally decided to bite the bullet and spend a weekend there by myself since I was tired of waiting on a friend to go with me. 

I came by myself, stayed at a hostel, faced my fears of riding the Metro and loved it, and had great food and then probably also walked it all off too. 

I'm applying for a school program outside of DC so I partly came to scope things out and I know I saw only a small piece of the city and life there, but I've really got to say, it was amazing. It is absolutely marvelous, the weather was impeccable, everyone was so nice when I needed directions and help on the Metro, and I had so many delightful (and reasonably priced) coffees. I absolutely can't wait to come back - next time I come, I really want to check out Drunk Shakespeare as well!

It’s safer to pull away; to walk away from things that could overwhelm your system. That’s why you stepped away, isn’t it? 
The rupture felt too far to be repaired? 


Well I can assure you that it is not. At least, not in the context of which we were both longing for. 
Connection. True, genuine connection. Not just mirroring, not just analyzing, but true safety to be exactly who we were, and know that it was okay, right? 


Sure, we could likely never get back to the dynamics we never quite had in the first place, but were placed upon us by others. That’s true, and in most cases, makes complete sense. 


I’m not attempting to be fanciful here, but there was something else in the space between you and I. You didn’t have to tell me much, because I could see through your eyes. Perhaps I’m abstract in believing you could do the same. 


You cared about me. I cared about you. Is that such a crime? Human nature, connection, appreciation for the other whole being of which you meet eyes with.

I might have read most of them already, but unfortunately no resolution has really worked for me. So I am back here writing a new post. 

We have users with Dell Precision 5000 series laptops with Windows 11 23H2, connected using the Dell WD22TB4 docking station. They are connected to 2 or 3 external Dell monitors. Most Dell monitors are U2520D or the P2423DE. Our users have reported they monitors go blank intermittently. The issue happens when they undock their laptop, go for a meeting, come back and dock again and one of the monitors won't come up. Some users who do no not remove their laptop from the dock at all, simply lock their device and step away for a coffee or lunch, come back and one of the monitors don't wake up. Current workaround is to unplug power from the monitors, wait 10-15 seconds and then plug it back in. This fixes the issue temporarily, however the issue comes back at random times for users.

My monitors connections:

* For 2 external monitors - I have them connected in 2 different ways
   * 1x USB-C (monitor) to  USB-C thunderbolt port (dock) + 1x DP (monitor) to 1x DP (dock)
   * 1x DP (monitor) to 1x DP (dock) + 1x DP (monitor) to 1x DP (dock)
* For 3 external monitors
   * 1x USB-C (monitor) to  USB-C thunderbolt port (dock) + 1x DP (monitor) to 1x DP (dock) + 1x DP (monitor) to 1x DP (dock)

What I have tried so far:

Followed the Dell KB: [Monitor Experiences Intermittent Blanking when Connected to Dell Docking Stations | Dell US](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000214256/monitor-experiences-intermittent-blanking-when-connected-to-wd19-or-wd22tb4-dock) and this had no effect whatsoever.  
- Downloaded the latest Dell Dock Firmware (released 4th Jan 2024) manually and updated the dock. Still had the issue  
- Checked the display driver versions, all up to date  
- Added the registries as suggested in the article, interestingly, it worked for users using the P2423DE but has no effect on users using U2520D.  
- It also appeared in some cases that the registry was already set to 0 and didn't need to be changed. But some posts on reddit suggest to change it to 2. I have tried this and that didn't help either.  
- In some cases, dock firmware is also up to date and registry value is set to 2 and the users have reported the issue. I changed it to 0 and the issue only happened less frequently, but still existed.

Contacted Dell support and obviously they have no clue about it at all on what is happening and have redirecting to old KBs which have no effect or not relevant to this case. They did ask to check few BIOS settings but we have them all in the correct order as they have suggested.

Questions:

1. Is the registry value is different for different monitor models? 0 works for some and 2 works for some? Or should it be 0 for all?
2. Not sure why all or most posts say to set the registry to 2 whereas the Dell KB says to set it to 0. What is the correct setting? Any idea?
3. I read in one of the blogs to disable USB selective suspend setting in power options. Is it recommended or needed?

# My Experience as a Beta Tester

I had the privilege of being a beta tester for Zync, and let me tell you, it was an eye-opening experience. As someone who's always struggled with consistent content creation, Zync was like a breath of fresh air.

I decided to test it out by creating a series of videos for my blog about digital marketing trends. Normally, this would have taken me weeks. With Zync, I had a full series done in just a few days.

The AI-generated scripts were surprisingly good. They captured my voice and style, needing only minor tweaks here and there. The automated editing saved me hours of work, and the multi-platform optimization meant I could share my content across all my social channels without breaking a sweat.

The results? My engagement rates shot up, I gained new followers, and I even landed a speaking gig at a marketing conference based on one of the videos I created.

# Should You Use Zync?

However, if you're an advanced video editor who enjoys having granular control over every aspect of your videos, Zync might feel a bit limiting.

1g9n0kl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/1g9n0kl/the_beautiful_fall_weather_brings_back_memories/,The beautiful fall weather brings back memories and the fun stuff mom and I used to do on my October vacations from work.,"When I I was working I had vacations in April, July , and October.  April and October were chosen because the weather is halfway decent here during that time.   I have been busy this morning doing errands.  Walk over to Target to pick up our groceries,  went to the laundry room to do mom's laundry and took the trash to the dumpster across the lane. The weather is so nice and i'm finally feeling the fall spirit.  But remember what simple fun mom and  I used to have during this time makes me sad.  Mom was up early this morning and stuffd herself food of snacks and is napping now.  She's been taking late morning naps the past week but it's not affected her sleep or behavior in any way.  

I would get 8 days off sun-sun. The friday before (I was always off on fridays) we would walk down and get donuts and coffee, then walk down to the grocery store to pick up groceries and walk back.

Then on sundays, I would take mom, my daughter, son in law  out to eat and then we'd go to Homegoods and Ross shopping for bargains.    Mondays mom and I would take the bus to an outside  shopping area and have lunch and do some light shopping, sit out in the park and enjoy the weather, stop at barnes and noble for coffee.  Tuesdays we would take the bus downtown and have lunch and take a ride on the light rail.   Wednesdays we'd take the bus to the 99 cent only store and stop and eat lunch. Thursdays we'd take the bus to the old neighborhood we used to live in and have lunch at sonic, and the buy groceries.  Friday we'd walk abouto a mile down to a deli we liked and have lunch.  The on sat and sun we'd just eat at the mall.   

My job was always stressful and tiring so we really didn't go anywhere or do much on my days off because I was just so stressed and it took my day off just to recover from the anxiety and stress.  Vacation weeks were the only time we got out of our area an did stuff around the city.  Sometime we'd go to museum exhibits like body worlds or the mummy exhibit.   

Now i'm sitting in the apartment instead of out doing stuff with mom.    Mom went out on the porch this morning for a moment but the air is so bad today, kinda hazy, that she wasn't out long and I had to close the window and turn the ac back on.   I wast looking at all my google photos over the years that I took during our  outings, I have hundred of pictures of mom just eating or sitting in the park, etc.   Things that seemed insignifant back then make me sad now , remembering when mom was whole.

No other health issues at all, never had bad bloodwork or lipids ever. I skipped getting bloodwork for 3 years and recently got results back with high cholesterol/triglycerides. (previous results 3 years ago were normal). My non-fasting results (I literally ate a cheese stick on the way to the appt):

* total cholesterol: 231   (high)
* triglycerides: 389   (high)
* HDL: 44
* LDL: 109
* non-HDL Chol: 187

Note: my father also has high cholesterol and has it managed, but not perfect, with his diet; so likely genetic component. (he went mostly vegetarian and cut out egg yolks and cheese). 

I'm a long-term vegetarian and tended to eat a ton of eggs (1-5 per day) and cheese, and toast with butter, plus weekly dinners would be half a frozen pizza, cheese quesadilla, instant ramen + veggies, fries + veggie burger. 

That said, I like throwing together veggies/beans/rice or pasta already, so those high-saturated-fat meals above are easy to cut/substitute for veggies/beans/carb bowl. If I could share my currently-implemented plan, I'd like to know if I'm over-thinking things.

I love cheese, eggs, and peanut butter, so this is slightly painful.

* adding a high-intensity workout every other day, and I already bike a few leisurely miles most days
* adding fiber supplement, and fish oil supplement
* coffee: switch to soy milk (from whole milk) and no sugar
* no more frozen pizzas, ramen, fries; except a bite here and there :) -- this is pretty easy for me, but I worry about losing the calories...
* switch to peanut butter on toast for breakfast
* no egg yolks; switch to egg whites only
* snacks: fruit, pita chips/veggie straws + hummus, toast + peanut butter, nuts.
* much less cheese if I have a quesadilla occasionally
* I already ate a lot of beans like with eggs and pasta and stuff, but now even a bit more sans eggs.

Reasonable? What am I missing?

Questions:

1. I don't want to lose weight. Can I simply eat more beans/veggies/rice freely?
2. Can I eat a lot of egg whites without affecting my numbers?

The Rangers are coming off a 4-1 thrashing of the Toronto Maple Leafs, while the Canadiens are reeling from a 4-3 shootout loss to the New York Islanders.

The Rangers are sitting pretty with a 4-0-1 record, good for second in the Eastern Conference with 9 points. Meanwhile, the Canadiens are struggling with a 2-3-1 record, which has them stuck in 11th place with 5 points.

Now, let's talk about the odds. The Rangers are favored to win, with a price of 1.43 on BetRivers, while the Canadiens are sitting at 2.9. The over/under is set at 6.0, with the over priced at 1.88 and the under at 1.93.

Here's the thing: the Canadiens are due for a win, and they're playing at home, where they tend to be a bit more feisty. The Rangers, on the other hand, are on the road, where they might be a bit more vulnerable.

But let's be real, folks. The Rangers are the better team, and they're on a roll. I'm not going to bet against them, especially not when they're favored by 1.5 goals.

My best bet for this game is the Rangers to win, but I'm going to hedge my bet by taking the Canadiens +1.5 goals. That way, I've got some insurance in case the Canadiens decide to show up and play some actual hockey.

So, there you have it. Rangers to win, but Canadiens +1.5 goals. And if you're feeling fancy, take the under 6.0 goals. The Rangers tend to play a bit more defensively, and the Canadiens are still trying to figure out how to score.

Prediction: Rangers 3, Canadiens 2.

Best bet: Canadiens +1.5 goals.

Under/over: Under 6.0 goals.",1,1729615528.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

We also have a 9 year old Aussie Doxie (Piper), and an 8 year old Pittie (Cupcake). Everyone gets along fine. My husband and I have raised several dogs over the years and have owned a Corgi before. This particular Corgi has been the most difficult to train. He's smart but he does not give a flying F. Potty training was exceedingly difficult. He understood to go out the doggy door to go poop but he seemed to think the upstairs carpet was the place to pee. We crated him in a large crate at nights for a long time before we trusted him and he's done well for the last 3 months. I've had the carpet professionally cleaned twice now.

He went through a phase of peeing in the kitchen after all 3 had finished eating, he would pee right in the middle space between all of their bowls. We had to be vigilant. I couldn't turn my back to make a cup of coffee or blend a smoothie. He would strike that fast. As soon as they were done eating, I had to swoop in and pick up the bowls. He has since abandoned this behavior for about 3 months and we are able to just leave the bowls down or at least make coffee while they eat breakfast. 

  
Now, night before last, he decided to pee upstairs at the top of the steps. And today he's peed just in front of the downstairs crates which are situated on hard floor. Not even 5 feet away from the doggy door. Is this normal for a 1 year old puppy? Is he marking territory? I've had 5 puppies at this age in the past and none of them did this. All were potty trained within a few weeks of coming into our home. This little guy just...I don't understand. I know they don't do things out of spite but I griped at him this morning about playing too rough and I feel like he peed in front of Piper's crate to piss me off for griping at him.

I got prescribed 20mg of aderall but im taking the generic cause my insurance doesn’t cover brand names medication. I just wanted to ask if what im feeling is normal. Ive been taking it for 3 days first time i took it i was amazed, i had taken some coffee not knowing i wasn’t supposed to and at first felt accelerated and irritable, but after 30 minutes or so it was like a switch and i felt calm and light, i could finally sit and study and not feel anxious or like i was going to cry from the overwhelming feeling of how much i had to study, i was being talked to and i was actually listening, not thinking about what i was going to respond and i could stay still. It was amazing . The next time tho I didn’t take caffeine and barely felt concentrated i didn’t feel anything, third time tried a little bit of coffee and it worked i was really foucused but sometimes found myself staring into things not thinking at all i had to pull myself out and keep studying its like if i do nothing i zone out. I kinda still get distracted but its way less  but i also find that the effect’s dont last that long , like i take it and barely feel anything and after like 2-3 hours thats when i get in hyperfocus mode  and lasts like three hours in that state and then it wears off and i get cranky and a headache. Also the feeling of drymouth reminds me of edibles its so weird.

He waited outside in the car a while as she and Oak got things going, and then strolled in to be their first customer of the day, just as Opal arrived.

""Juice, please,"" Kai nodded to Hannah, smiling.

When she went back to get his drink, Opal was laughing, chatting to Oak about how much better Herb was, and how he would be home in a week.

""Real good news,"" Oak said.  
""Real good.""

""Well, Hannah,"" Opal asked, ""how you been?""

""Oh, I been great, Opal. 'Scuse me.""

The usual suspects were drifting in, and after Hannah handed Kai his juice, she was swept into a whirl of order-taking and banter. The last she saw of Kai was after he paid, when he sauntered out of the place just as Frank came in. The brothers stopped and talked in the doorway, far enough apart for Reverend Portnoy to sidle between them, and then Kai was gone.

Frank ordered his usual, but when Hannah went over to Reverend Portnoy, things got a little odd.

""Give me just a moment, Hannah,"" the minister said.

The words were kind enough, but there was a storm brewing in the face of the speaker. Hannah, a little nervous, obliged, going along and taking other orders until the minister waved her over.

""Black coffee,"" he said, ""and a piece of toast, well-buttered.""

She thought she had become used to Reverend Portnoy no longer ordering his usual, but today's request was so different, so small, that it gave Hannah pause, and her pen shivered against the ticket.

""You sure?"" she asked.

""Hmmn,"" the Reverend nodded.

Affirmative.

Hannah scrawled the ticket, got it to the kitchen, and then tried to be busy. When she noticed Frank slide over a bit at the counter and begin to talk to Reverend Portnoy, she shivered.

For some reason, she had the sense that there was a disaster afoot.

1g9mj2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scorpio/comments/1g9mj2g/scorpio_tattoo_artist_playing_games/,Scorpio tattoo artist playing games?,"I (22f) stopped by this tattoo artist (26m) Scorpio to get a tattoo done. I haven't been tattooed by him before. The tattoo took 2 days. The first day he behaved professionally or rather respectfully. No nicknames, no sexual or intense vibes. He did half of the tattoo (took 6 hours) and we agreed to finish the rest a few days after. 

When the second and last day came he behaved completely differently. During these 6 hours he could not stop staring at me intensely and smiling. He knows my full name, but he still chooses to call me ""honey"" when he talks to me during the tattooing process. I asked about his age, to which he says he is 26 years old. And then he asks about my age, to which I say that I am 22 years old. He then says ""What do you think of my age? Is 26 too old for you?"". I then say no and that ""26 is a good age."". He blushes, becomes shy during the whole process. He makes excuses to maintain body contact with me during the tattoo. For example, bumping his hand into mine, or putting his own on mine, but in a sly way. At first he would put his airpods in and listen to music during the tattooing process and wouldn't take them out to talk to me when I asked him about it. But on the second day he chose not to listen to music and just talk to me for 6 hours. Every time I talk to him he turns completely red and shy, smiles and stares intensely into my eyes endlessly without blinking. He literally gives me ""fuck me eyes"" sorry for the expression 😭 And constantly leans close to me when we talk, so that there are only a few centimeters between us. He asks me through the process ""How do you feel? Do you feel pain? Are you in pain?"" with a slightly sexual facial expression. When I say it hurts, he pushes harder and harder, like he's enjoying it. He acts caring and asks (about 15 times) if he should bring me water or coffee, and leans in all the time when he walks up to me. When he speaks to other guests, his voice is normal. But when he speaks to me, his voice becomes seductive, intimate and erotic. I felt a sexual and intimate connection with him. Every time he applies cream to my tattoo, he rubs intensely everywhere for a full 15 minutes each time. 15 minutes each time to apply cream to just one side of my forearm? (my arm is thin and small lmao). 

When we finished the tattoo and we had to say goodbye he walked up to me, took my hand and kept shaking it. And turned red and shy again. We agreed that he should complete my arm with colors (it is now only black and grey). But he is going back to his country in a week and a half. And he only comes back to my country again to tattoo after 2 months. 

He promised me when he tattooed me (on Friday) to give me a cream to put on my tattoo. But when I got home I realized he forgot to give me the cream. Whether it was on purpose or not I don't know. So now I have to go back to get the cream from him. I wrote to him on Instagram (we've written together before about the tattoo) that he forgot to give me the cream. He says I have to come back in 3 days and pick it up. I ask what time of day is better for him that I come by and pick up the cream. And then it says on Instagram that he has read my message, but left me on read. (He constantly posts stories and is online most of the time. Especially after my message, he posted 20+ stories). So now I don't know if I should just show up randomly to get the cream, what if he's not there at the time, or busy with another tattoo?

So today I chose to just go to the studio and get the cream because my tattoo has started to dry out and scratch off even though he didn't reply back to my message after reading it. When I saw him he turned red and acted intense. He asked intensely how I am. I confronted him and said why is he reading my message without replying. He played dumb and said ""What message? On Instagram or where? What do you mean?"" etc. Even though it clearly says on Instagram that he has read it.

What does his behavior mean? Why is he caring and flirty face to face but ignores my messages on Instagram and gives me the cold shoulder? (not the first time I've been ignored by him online). It's so confusing.

I'm wondering if anyone could share their feelings about: **Crows Cats And Vampire Bats, Gray November, It’s All In Your Head, Monsters Still Under My Bed, Queen Of Moths, The Library Burning Down With Us, With The Fishes And The Dead**. Here are all the scents I've tried so far and my thoughts, in case you're also pondering another Death & Floral order!
  
**First Spring** *(suede, vanilla, ancient forest wood, oak, tonka bean, sea salt)*: This transports me inside memories of staying in old wood cabins. The vanilla and suede are noticeable and create a tasty softness peeking through pleasant must and musk. An interesting blend that makes me want to go live in the forest. My boyfriend said it smelled like old wood and a leather shop. **8/10**
  
**If We Make It Through December** *(black coffee, oudh, creamed honey, myrrh, chilly winter air, ginger)*: This smells like a fancy latte. Creamy, sweet, with some experimental but perfect blend of spices and syrups. Within half an hour the woody, vaguely medicinal myrrh and oud become more noticeable as coffee becomes a suggestion instead of the star of the show. It’s not the coffee-centered scent I hoped for but it’s not bad! **6/10**
  
**Jo March** *(pen ink, leather bound books, a cracking fire, amber)*: This is surprisingly gentle and beautiful with ink and leather at the forefront. Feels like writing a scribbly diary entry in a leather journal. Strangely comforting. There are warm, mildly sweet, sort of floral elements in the background. I didn't expect to find an inky, leathery smell this soft and pretty. **7/10**
  
**Melodrama** *(black patchouli, cognac, toasted oats)*: This was a free sample in my order and it might be my favorite thing I received. Without looking at the notes, I put it on my skin and smelled cereal and something deep, dark, and sweet. It all made so much sense when I checked their website. There’s a pinch of spice to it and mild musky earthiness from the patchouli. Everything blends together super well. This borders on too sweet for me but is saved by unique, alluring depth and warmth. The EDP version smells identical. **9/10**
  
**Pile Of Green Goo** *(rotting wood, oakmoss, white oud, rose resins)*: Musky roses lying in the rain. A dark and damp floral. Interesting and pleasant but not quite my thing. **6/10**
  
**Plain Jane** *(black oudh, fresh coffee, rolled tobacco, musk, cedar, cinnamon crunch cereal)*: A pleasant, mildly funky coffee scent. It starts out as a somewhat sweetened, cinnamon flavored coffee. After about thirty minutes, musk and tobacco become far more evident while cinnamon begins fading. This ends up as an enjoyable, caffeinated musk. I would love this a lot more if it lasted longer and held onto the stronger cinnamon and tobacco it started with. **7/10**
  
**Shadow Monsters On Wooden Cabin Walls** *(dark chocolate, jasmine, blood orange, tobacco, woodsmoke)*: This starts out musty and funky but in a nice way? A dark sweetness and something woodsy with a mildly floral background. Unfortunately after about fifteen minutes it gets a sharp and bitter quality. I’ve heard this brand benefits from aging but as of right now it fades very quickly too. **3/10** (none of this changed after a month of resting)
  
**The End Is Here** *(vanilla coke, bourbon, fleeing animals, musk)* I was on the fence about getting this because a lot of people said it was straight vanilla cola, and I wasn’t sure if that sounded appealing or not. It’s one of the more interesting vanilla forward perfumes I’ve encountered. There is a muskiness to it but it’s very mild. It’s sweet but not in a sugary way. Strangely, it’s very cold. Some people referred to this as a Fallout scent and I can totally imagine I’m drinking cola in a vault somewhere. Not exactly my thing but it’s nice. I enjoy it more than other vanilla-focused perfume. **6/10**
  
**The Scent Of Your Skin And Some Foreign Flowers** *(boxed chocolate cereal, oakwood, toasted brown sugar, tonka bean, pantry spices, dried roses)*: This smells like opening a box of chocolates in an old, abandoned attic. Which for some reason I actually really like? Woody, warm, spicy, and sweet. It’s not very floral on me which is a huge plus. I bought the EDP version and it's very similar but slightly sweeter and has a noticeable vanilla quality. **8/10** 
  
**Two Cups Of Tea, A Summer Monsoon, And Me And You** *(rain, soil, wet creosote, a swelling monsoon, desert cedar, black tea)*: I was nervous during the first minute or two after application when I just got a perfumey crispness from it. As it dries it darkens and becomes beautifully earthy and wet. There’s a noticeable touch of cedar but it remains light and far from your typical woodsy fragrance. Unfortunately there’s an intense, crisp quality I can’t get past. **6/10**",14,1729614633.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,1.0,False

I had to leave several times to try to pull myself together and still I couldn't, I ended up closing my eyes looking directly at the teacher, I don't want her to think I don't care or don’t like her classes. She’s an amazing teacher.
I drink several cups of coffee and energy drinks a day, but I still can't stay more than 1 hour without sleep.

They're now 10 weeks old and were spayed and neutered on Friday. We chose to adopt them so we picked them up from their surgery that afternoon. The vet said that because they are young they'll heal fast, and may not eat a lot or play for the first 24-48 hours. They did not get any medications to bring home, no paperwork and no cones. They just said their stomachs may be upset for two days and then they'll be fine.

Well, they're not at all. The first day they acted almost entirely normal, ate all their food and played. Then the next day onwards they've been lethargic, vomiting and having liquid poos the color of coffee with too much milk and they will barely eat. The male follows me around and lightly cries. They are jumping off the couch to get water through the night and still using the litter box, and also once a day for maybe 20 minutes or less lightly playing, but it is now Tuesday and I woke up at 5am to vomit again. I boiled chicken and fed them a little hoping it would help but it doesn't seem to have done so.

Is this normal? Should I be waiting a few days, seeing a different vet, or going back to the shelter? I'm so worried about them, but I don't think they have fading kitten syndrome or are crashing because they're on the couch purring.

Hi, I am 27M and have been getting to know this girl (24F) through several community events. At first I thought she was very attractive, but we did not talk much. Over the last month or so, we’ve been talking at almost every event and I have had some one-on-one time with her. I noticed that in group events, where she knows some of my friends and I know some of her friends, she doesn’t go out of her way to come talk to me, but would be very responsive and conversational when I approach her or say hi. 
I became interested in her and am excited to see her every week we have a common activity or event. Last week, I asked her if she wants to grab coffee after playing soccer, we did, and I walked her to her car. The same day, she texted saying that her friend bailed and can’t go to some art event they were going to, and asked if I wanted to go with her. We went there together but then her friend caught up with us. 
The day after, I asked her if she wanted to go to the park and chill/ draw, she said yes and we talked for a couple of hours. It was a really good time but we made no plans after. 
I feel like this is developing more into a friendship, but I am really into her. And for context; I have gone out on so many dates over the last year, not a flex or anything, just emphasizing that I normally don’t get too nervous around girls, and can pick up signs or hints, but with this girl, I do get nervous and can’t really read her. I actually am really into her. 
I do feel like we have chemistry, and I would be surprised if she didn’t notice that I am trying to spend time with her (more than what a normal acquaintance/ new friend would). 
I would ask her out for dinner, and i know that that’s the only way to know, but still, I’d rather know beforehand if she is looking at this as a friendship or not, because I do want to keep my friendship with the rest of the friend group and not make it awkward (went through that once and it ruined the friendship).

Any thoughts? Tips?

1g9m6yb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g9m6yb,DBD X Something Is Killing The Children: Killer Edition.,"Warning - The arts on this blog belong to their respective creators, such as Werther Dell'Edera and Miquel Muerto.

• New Killer - The Cutter.

Charlotte Cutter was born in England and trained since childhood by the ""House Of Cutter"". During her various missions, she has always shown herself to be a professional assassin and still manage to ensure that no loose ends are left alive, including children. However, despite her profession being focused on killing monsters, she was sent to America to hunt down and kill Erica Slaughter, a fugitive hunter from the ""House Of Slaughter"". Fortunately, when Erica and Charlotte were about to kill each other, a mysterious fog appeared out of nowhere and they both woke up in a completely different place. Charlotte smiled and knew that her fun with Erica would never end.

• Killer Power - Black Mask:

When you press your ability button, you enter Cutter's ""Black Mask"" mode. While in this mode, you are Undetectable and walk a little crouched, but nothing that compromises your movement speed. The noise from certain actions is also reduced, you break generators, pallets and breakable walls more silently. While in Black Mask mode, you can see Survivors' footsteps up to 10 meters behind walls and have the ability to enter closets to surprise your victims. However, Black Mask mode has a duration and cooldown of 30 seconds. If you enter a closet, your ability duration remains frozen until you exit the closet. If you are stunned, blinded, or use a basic attack in Black Mask mode, your ability is canceled and goes on cooldown.

• Special Attack - Cutter's Whip.

When you click the special attack button, Cutter uses her whip to grab Survivors within 5 meters of her. If you hit a Survivor with the whip, they will be pulled towards you and you can use a basic attack on them. However, if the Survivors are on the other side of a pallet, Cutter can jump/climb the obstacle and perform a basic attack. There will be a visual sound for the Survivors when Cutter uses her whip and the Survivors have a chance to dodge the attack. Cutter can use the whip when Black Mask mode is on or off.

• Cutter's Perks:

1 - HEX: MONSTROUS RAGE:

You hate it when people steal what's yours.

When the first generator is completed, Hex: Monstrous Rage activates and transforms a Dull Totem into a Hex Totem.

When Hex: Monstrous Rage is active, you gain a 50% speed bonus when jumping windows, kicking generators, breaking pallets and breakable walls until the Hex Totem is destroyed or blessed.

2 - SCOURGE HOOK: CHILDREN'S SCREAM.

You're good at your job, but you have fun doing other things.

At the start of the match, 4 Hooks become Scourge Hooks and are revealed with a white aura.

When you hook a Survivor into a Scourge Hook, all Survivors outside your Terror Radius scream, revealing their positions for 5 seconds. Survivors who scream suffer from Blindness and Oblivious status effects for 30 seconds.

3 - INVISIBLE MASSACRE.

You caused death and misery in several cities, but you always managed to keep everyone unaware of your actions.

When a generator is completed you earn 2 tokens up to a maximum of 5.

When you click on this Perk's special button, you consume 1 token and gain Undetectable for 25 seconds.

• Extra Information:

During Black Mask mode, you gain a 50% speed bonus when jumping windows, breaking pallets, destroying breakable walls, kicking generators, grabbing Survivors, and opening lockers until the ability ends.

I'd like to get your perspective on something. I've worked in the coffee industry for nearly a decade and I'm hoping that next year is the year everything sets in place and I have my own coffee truck. 

With that in mind, I'm currently a cafe manager looking at a barista role to 1) get away from a bit of a circus and 2) be able to go part time later on with my business on the side. 

Something I've struggled with is whether or not to tell employers my plans (my most recent employer knew at interview that that was my goal), as I am worried they will think I'm trying to poach customers or use their business as a stop gap. What approach do you feel is best? Being honest or keeping it under wraps? 

I'm already worried about what they might think about me stepping down and why, I just genuinely love the industry but want to stay in its orbit while organising myself for future plans. Thanks for any input! ",1,1729614116.0,coffeeshopowners,3,1.0,False

1. I'm not replacing anyone! So if you see this and I haven't responded please reach back out!
2. Please be At least a little literate, You don't need to respond with 2-3 paragraphs but just spell things correctly!

Well lets get onto the prompts! and As always, I will gladly change up the prompts for it to interest you more!

***Fantasy Prompt: The War Torn Bard***  
the bard and the witch meet in the aftermath of the raid, surrounded by the wreckage of the village. Initially, the witch is wary---sensing the powerful but uncontrolled magic that radiates from you. The bard, holding his sword and ready for a fight. Unaware of the magic within him, he doesn't trust her either, seeing only a stranger with strange powers and cold eyes.

Tension crackles between them, and perhaps even a brief skirmish, but the witch quickly realizes that your power is not something to be feared, but something to be harnessed. She knows that who ever attacked were not simply attacking the village; they were searching for something...Someone. They were drawn here, just as she was, by your untapped magic, and now that they know you exist, they’ll come for you again.

Some notes about this one! :: I do have a set oc for this one! so if you wanted to see it to decide if you liked this one I'll gladly show! you also doesn't have to be a witch! you can really be whatever Just the idea of a warn torn fantasy world is enough for me

***SOL prompts: Caretaker***  
My oc (or yours) have been friends for years, Sadly one of us got in a really bad car crash, Ending up in a coma for a few weeks. Worried sick about the other they where bedside every day. One night, they received a call, It was the others mother. They had awoken...(ill let what plays out at the hospital)

They have taken up the responsibility of helping the other with the lower mobility, and daily life. Will feelings arise?

More notes!: This is a very basic prompt, Mainly cause its very basic... No more elaboration.

***The Charming Cafe***: A charming café located in the heart of a vibrant urban neighborhood, surrounded by eclectic shops, art galleries, and street musicians. The café has a cozy atmosphere, filled with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the sound of soft jazz music.  
My Oc(or yours!) would be a barista at the café, known for their exceptional coffee-making skills and warm smile. They take pride in creating a welcoming space for customers but often keep their personal life private.  
The Other perhaps a Familiar face, A visible face on a busy day in the cafe. Lets figure the rest of this together!

Unexpected Roommates: Due to a mix-up, two strangers end up sharing an apartment. Their initially awkward cohabitation turns into a comfortable companionship and eventually, love. (much smaller one)

Around 3 months ago, Jane's spouse, we'll call him John, died suddenly while they were on vacation. It was very shocking. They were together for 6 years and madly in love. All of Jane's friends including Christy have been supporting her. We recently went out together as a group for the first time since his death.

Here's where I think I might be the asshole. Christy's grandmother died around the same time as John. She told me this the day after John's death but never confided with Jane or our other friends until about a month after John's passing. So in the first month or so I made sure to check on her. But I admit I was giving more attention to Jane. I brought her flowers, made time to get her out of the house, gave her space to cry and talk about John. I looked up resources on how to help someone grieving the loss of a partner and I myself can empathize with Jane because I don't know what I would do with myself if I lost my husband.

However, recently I've been noticing some quesionable behaviours from Christy. When the 3 of us are together and just talking about how we are doing, Jane will usually bring up John as a grieving wife would. But I notice that Christy will change the subject to something completely different. Usually someone she has a problem with at work. And then she'll say something like ""People at work need to learn to treat me better and that people like me and Jane are still grieving. I just lost my grandmother and she just lost her husband. 3 months is not enough to get over that"". 

The thing is, this is the only context in which she'll talk about her grandmother. I'm more than happy to give her the space to grieve and work through the complexities of the loss but most of our private conversations are usually about the boy at work who she's obsessed with, the girl at work who ""has it out for her"" or the other girl at work who's trying to copy the way she dresses so she can get more attention from the guy she wants. Christy has a boyfriend by the way and they're not doing well but she refuses to leave the relationship because she's ""already in love with him.""

This obsession with the guy at work and issues with her relationship had been going on way before anyone died but it escalated when Jane and I started to push back on her perception of the situation and I'm honestly exhausted by all the gossip and the delusion. When we bring up the obsession, she'll claim she hasn't spoken about it in weeks which is a blatant lie. 4 days ago I said it would benefit her to seek professional help because her obsession with this guy isn't healthy and I needed space to focus on my well-being.

I'm still in contact with Jane and she's been telling me that Christy has been getting mad at her. Saying she's tired of her using her dead husband as a tool to get attention and that no one is paying attention to her even though her grandma just died. This made me angry and I'm set on ending the friendship for good because of it. But I'm wondering if I'm the asshole here for not giving her enough attention.

1g9m1kx,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1g9m1kx/m4f_a_few_fantasy_and_sol_slowburn_romances_d/,[M4F] A few Fantasy and SOL Slowburn romances :D,"Heyo! Before I start listing some Prompts, A few things first.

1. I'm not replacing anyone! So if you see this and I haven't responded please reach back out!

2. Please be At least a little literate, You don't need to respond with 2-3 paragraphs but just spell things correctly!

Well lets get onto the prompts! and As always, I will gladly change up the prompts for it to interest you more!

***Fantasy Prompt: The War Torn Bard***  
the bard and the witch meet in the aftermath of the raid, surrounded by the wreckage of the village. Initially, the witch is wary---sensing the powerful but uncontrolled magic that radiates from you. The bard, holding his sword and ready for a fight. Unaware of the magic within him, he doesn't trust her either, seeing only a stranger with strange powers and cold eyes.

Tension crackles between them, and perhaps even a brief skirmish, but the witch quickly realizes that your power is not something to be feared, but something to be harnessed. She knows that who ever attacked were not simply attacking the village; they were searching for something...Someone. They were drawn here, just as she was, by your untapped magic, and now that they know you exist, they’ll come for you again.

Some notes about this one! :: I do have a set oc for this one! so if you wanted to see it to decide if you liked this one I'll gladly show! you also doesn't have to be a witch! you can really be whatever Just the idea of a warn torn fantasy world is enough for me

***SOL prompts: Caretaker***  
My oc (or yours) have been friends for years, Sadly one of us got in a really bad car crash, Ending up in a coma for a few weeks. Worried sick about the other they where bedside every day. One night, they received a call, It was the others mother. They had awoken...(ill let what plays out at the hospital)

They have taken up the responsibility of helping the other with the lower mobility, and daily life. Will feelings arise?

More notes!: This is a very basic prompt, Mainly cause its very basic... No more elaboration. 

***The Charming Cafe***: A charming café located in the heart of a vibrant urban neighborhood, surrounded by eclectic shops, art galleries, and street musicians. The café has a cozy atmosphere, filled with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the sound of soft jazz music.  
My Oc(or yours!) would be a barista at the café, known for their exceptional coffee-making skills and warm smile. They take pride in creating a welcoming space for customers but often keep their personal life private.  
The Other perhaps a Familiar face, A visible face on a busy day in the cafe. Lets figure the rest of this together!

  
Unexpected Roommates: Due to a mix-up, two strangers end up sharing an apartment. Their initially awkward cohabitation turns into a comfortable companionship and eventually, love. (much smaller one)   
we can gladly figure this one out together!

1g9m0np,https://www.reddit.com/r/keurig/comments/1g9m0np/got_scammed/,Got scammed????,"Hello everyone,

I am feeling incredibly pissed off and confused. I made an order for my boss using the Keurig business bundle from this website (see picture) that I thought was the official Keurig website. It has the exact same layout, formatting, customer service number, etc. as the official Keurig website. The only difference is slightly in the URL. However, I got no confirmation and it still hasn't shipped since October 16 or 17th. I emailed Keurig (the contact form on the website I used to order) and got a reply that they dont have an order under my order number. I then called today and was told that the website I ordered from was not Keurig's website????????? I asked my boss to check his bank account and he said no money was even taken out for the order on 10/16. What kind of scam is this???? Is this a scam or just Keurig's old website????? I am so pissed off that I spent so much time on this when I literally just searched ""keurig commercial coffee maker"" in Google and clicked on the official link, only for this to happen. I also can't find anything else about this scam on Reddit or any other site. ",1,1729613705.0,keurig,5,0.67,False
