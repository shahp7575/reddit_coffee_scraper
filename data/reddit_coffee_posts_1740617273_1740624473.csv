1iz3ak2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1iz3ak2/food_noise_definitely_changing/,Food noise definitely changing,"I'm a newbie on zep I'm on week 3 on 2.5mg and I'm really trying not to dwell on the number on the scale and weigh myself weekly. Well today I realized that the pants I wore yesterday and today (2 different ones) that are size 14 actually fit, I have been a size 16 for a good while and I was just in a rush yesterday and today that I didn't put much thought i just dressed myself and had to be out the door.  Also today was running late and went to the grocery store and essentially I was going to get a bagel and energy drink but as soon as I walked in and smelled the bread (I love the smell of yeast hobby baker) I naturally wanted to just grab a bagel or crossiant but my stomach and like the back of my throat just felt ugghh like disgusted and gagged a bit eventhough I internally wanted it. I opted for protein shake with coffee and a bowl of mixed fruit. I usually meal prep but this week has been hectic but that is a win for me. Slowly but surely making changes.",3,1740617361.0,Zepbound,1,1.0,False
1iz39n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompoundedSemaglutide/comments/1iz39n9/weight_loss_amounts_okay_lost/,Weight loss amounts okay? Lost!!,"Hi all! I’ve struggled with losing weight my whole life due to hypothyroidism and bipolar disorder. I started semaglutide compound through HERS and have lost 3.8 pounds so far. I started on Feb. 15th on 8 units (.2 mg) for the first 4 weeks. Will go up to .16 units (.4 mg) in two weeks. I started at 260 pounds, am 5 foot 7, and have a pretty sedentary job. Goal weight is honestly just getting under 200 pounds at this point (160 the real goal). 

My diet is ok but could be less carby. Don’t drink anything but black coffee, water, and almond milk occasionally. I guess what I’m asking is: am I losing at a good pace!? I don’t wanna give up early but I’m not sure if I’m doing this right haha. Any eating tips welcome. I’m a busy mom of three kids, all under the age of 5, working on my PhD and teaching full time. Thanks!",1,1740617286.0,CompoundedSemaglutide,3,1.0,False
