1q7872m,https://www.reddit.com/r/nocontact/comments/1q7872m/conflicted_on_breaking_nc/,Conflicted on breaking NC,"My ex (24) and I (24) were together for four years. We were very close and talked seriously about the future. We met in college, but last year she moved 3/4 hours away. Shortly after returning from a holiday over the summer together, I had an intense period of study for professional law exams. I was under a non repeatable, high-stakes exam window tied to my career timeline, and I became withdrawn and overly focused on studying. I sensed that something was off with her and asked repeatedly, but she said she was just under pressure trying to find work. About a week after my exams ended, she ended the relationship suddenly. It was initially left on good terms, and after a few days she wanted to take each other off social media. I unadded her on almost everything in response. It was irrational and hurt both of us really. After the breakup, my mental health declined, and I spent time in therapy reflecting on my role in how things ended. About a month later, I broke no contact to send a message taking accountability for my part in how things ended. Her response was polite but distant, and she said it would be best to cut contact so we could both move forward. Now, nearly three months post-breakup, I still care deeply about her and don’t hold any resentment. I have a strong urge to reach out again, even just to say hi or ask if she’d be open to meeting for a coffee, despite knowing there’s a chance it would lead to disappointment. I just want an actual conversation with her, to see how she’s doing and catch up. Being strangers with her after spending so much time together is awful and as much as I want to forget about her, I just am stuck thinking about her. ",1,1767867405.0,nocontact,0,1.0,False

I'm living in UK for many years I'm European originally, so I'd generally want to meet someone within flight or driving distance in the country, not afraid of distance and willing to commit to right person.

Something about me I'm single and forever alone and I hope to change that, just bad luck in life never had luck in love, I'm 5'11 or 180 cm, black hairs and brown eyes.

I do travel a lot by myself and want to find someone who is equally curious about world, especially history of our Europe, I love old cities and small towns, villages.

I love animals a lot especially Cats and Capybaras are my favourite, but I like so many of them it's hard to put all!

I am gaming so would be nice to have someone to do things together, mainly Battlefield, Total War: Warhammer, Resident Evil, Witcher 3, Bloodborne and many more.

I do love Tv shows and movies mainly Gothic Horror, Military, currently loved It: Welcome to Derry! I have so many it's hard to put everything.

And many more intersts like photography, history (medieval and renaissance, antiquity), music (I don't play anything just listening), books and I love coffee ☕ addicted haha.

I sincerely hope to find someone here after many failed attempts, I believe it can happen. I am looking for someone with good communication, who wants to voice call or video call often because texting doesn't get you anywhere from experience. I want real thing and commitment fully and make it real not just online thing so of course meeting in real is important, and also ready for relationship to build something meaningful.

I generally prefer someone who is between 25-37 ( don't mind age gap but not huge) ,i don't know what else, just hoping for good experience and something to change for good, would be happy to exchange pics during chat.",1,1767867329.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

In my first relationship (a teenage love) it’s somewhat understandable; everything is felt and handled differently back then, and sometimes you don't reach that level of deep love. When I needed a bit more space for myself, it ended, but there was no real communication there, so I’m not sure to what extent that was the cause.
Later, in my next relationship, I was with a girl for almost four years. She had significant struggles with depression, eating disorders, and family issues (in fact, we met because of one of those problems). For the first two years, I was by her side at every moment (being this reciprocal, of course), especially regarding her eating disorder. Her weight went from 80-90kg to almost 50kg. I always supported her and tried to be a steady, firm presence in her life.
Then, things improved for her, and she simply stopped being as attentive. She started demanding things that seemed trivial at first (like making her coffee) but she would get angry if it wasn't to her liking or throw other nonsense in my face. I would get up because she couldn't sleep, even knowing I had to work or was exhausted... etc.
It reached a point where, this time, I was the one who needed support. I was in a bad place for about three months due to a personal matter. At first, she was there and overwhelmed me with support, but that lasted less than a month. Then she started telling me that my being unwell (or still having that problem on my mind despite time passing) was overwhelming her. Eventually, she left me.
She said we were incompatible because I wasn't giving her as much attention anymore, that she had her own problems, and that she felt I wasn't 'there' (even though during that time I continued to listen to her and be attentive, just perhaps less intensely because I needed to focus on myself). She told me she loved me and wanted to talk about 'us' in the future, but wanted to break up for now (although now it all sounds like an excuse to me) and that she still wanted to be friends.

1q782jn,https://wordswisdom.app/landing.html,"I built a Smart, Personal Vocabulary Builder that adapts to your English level using AI Roleplay & Spaced Repetition","Hey everyone,
I’m a solo developer, and I’ve just released Words Wisdom on iOS. I built this because I wanted a more effective way to learn specific words without just memorizing translations. I designed it to be a smart and personalized vocabulary builder that adapts the content to you.
How it works (The Features):
The app is built around a specific pipeline to make sure you actually master the words you choose:
• ⚡️ Personalized Setup: You don't just get random words. You choose your CEFR English Level, your interests (Food, IT, Irregular Verbs, etc.), and your daily goal (5 to 50 words).
• 🧠 Immersive ""No-Translation"" Mode: You can choose ""Full Immersive Mode,"" where the AI generates definitions in English instead of your native language, helping you stop translating in your head.
• 🎭 AI Roleplay: This is the main bridge between learning and reviewing. The AI automatically generates realistic scenarios (like ordering coffee or booking a hotel) based exactly on the words you are learning. If you get stuck, there’s a ""Hint"" button to help you keep the conversation going.
• 🕵️‍♂️ AI Alias Mode: Before the roleplay, you learn the words by guessing them via AI-generated definitions, which strengthens your understanding of the context.
• 📉 SM2 Spaced Repetition: Once you pass the roleplay, the words graduate to the Review Stage. We use the SM2 algorithm to schedule reviews so you never forget them.
• 🤖 ""Silent"" AI Calibration: In the background, the AI calculates an ""Ease Factor"" based on your level and the word category to magically adjust your review intervals.
• 📊 Daily Digests: You get personalized daily digests to track progress and keep your streak alive.
Privacy & Access:
I know people hate forced sign-ups, so I included a Guest Mode. You can use the full app without registering via Apple or Google if you prefer.
I’d love for you to try it out and let me know if the ""Roleplay"" scenarios feel natural to you!

Read 40+ research papers, 12 books, interviewed neuroscientists, binged podcasts. What I found is honestly disturbing.

Your attention span isn't dying because you're lazy or undisciplined. It's being systematically hijacked by billion-dollar companies who literally hire neuroscientists to make their apps more addictive. The average person now has an attention span shorter than a goldfish (8 seconds vs. 9 seconds). We're not broken, we're being broken.

But here's the thing. Your brain has neuroplasticity, meaning it can rewire itself. The damage isn't permanent if you act now.

The real problem nobody talks about

Your prefrontal cortex (the part that handles focus, decision making, impulse control) is basically being put to sleep every time you reach for your phone. Dr. Cal Newport calls this ""attention residue."" Every time you switch tasks, part of your brain is still thinking about the last thing. You're never fully present anywhere.

Research from Microsoft found that it takes an average of 23 minutes to fully refocus after a distraction. Think about how many times you check your phone per day (average is 96 times). Do the math. You're losing HOURS of deep focus daily.

What actually works (backed by science)

 Do absolutely nothing for 10 minutes daily. Sounds stupid but this is the 1 hack I learned from neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman's podcast. No phone, no music, no book. Just sit there. Your brain NEEDS boredom to reset its dopamine baseline. Modern life has completely eliminated boredom and your attention system is fried because of it. Started doing this in the morning with coffee and honestly it feels like a system reboot.

 Block your phone like your life depends on it. Using Opal (costs like $5/month) to lock specific apps during certain hours. Sounds dramatic but Instagram is completely inaccessible from 8am to 6pm now. Focus sessions went from 12 minutes average to 90 minutes in like 3 weeks. The app also tracks screen time patterns and gives this brutal weekly report that's honestly embarrassing but motivating.

 Read physical books for 30+ minutes daily. Not articles, not tweets, actual books. ""Deep Work"" by Cal Newport is the bible here (Georgetown professor, his research on attention economics is insane). This book will actually make you angry at how much potential focus you've been robbed of. He breaks down why the ability to focus deeply is becoming the most valuable skill in the economy. Also grab ""Stolen Focus"" by Johann Hari, investigative journalist who spent 3 years researching the attention crisis. Brutally honest about how social media companies literally studied gambling addiction to design their apps.

 Practice ""attention athletics."" Borrowed this from Nir Eyal's ""Indistractable"" (Stanford lecturer who literally wrote the book on behavior design). Set a timer for 25 minutes and do ONE task. No email, no Spotify, no ""quick checks."" Just one thing. The brain will literally scream for the first week. Push through. After 2 weeks, the focus muscle starts rebuilding. After a month, it feels completely different. The book also has this amazing section on ""timeboxing"" that changed how entire days get structured.

 Track your focus score. There's this app called Endel that uses AI to create focus music based on heart rate, weather, time of day. Sounds gimmicky but the neuroscience behind it is legit (they partnered with Berlin's Charité hospital on clinical studies). It's basically personalized soundscapes that help the brain enter flow states. Game changer for deep work sessions.

The uncomfortable truth

Every book and researcher studied said the same thing. We're in the middle of an attention crisis that's comparable to the obesity epidemic. Just like processed foods hijacked our biology, infinite scroll hijacked our neurology. The companies profiting from this know exactly what they're doing.

The inability to focus for more than 30 seconds isn't a personal failure. But choosing to do nothing about it is. The brain can rebuild its attention system but conditions need to be created for it to happen.

I run a tech consulting company based in London, focused on digital transformation for manufacturing companies in Europe and the Middle East (process automation, bespoke internal software, ops systems).

While I’m here, I’d love to explore Shenzhen and the surrounding region from a business + culture perspective.

A few things I’m curious about:
- Less obvious places to understand Shenzhen’s tech / manufacturing ecosystem
- Coworking spaces, founder meetups, or tech/manufacturing-related events that are open to visitors
- Electronics or other markets worth visiting
- Any expos, trade shows, or industrial events happening in Shenzhen, Dongguan, HK or Guangzhou over the next month

one morning i’d get something pretty normal, then that night it’d be higher. then the next day it’d drop again like nothing happened. i was lowkey stressing and also kinda mad at myself for even checking, because it felt like i was creating a problem.

what helped (for me at least) was realizing i was basically doing everything wrong without knowing:

* taking it right after coffee or food
* sitting down for like 10 seconds then hitting start
* checking again and again if i didn’t like the number (which… made me more stressed, so yeah)
* comparing one single reading like it was a “grade”

i didn’t do anything extreme. i just started taking it at the same time most days, after sitting quiet for a few minutes, and i stopped re-checking 5 times in a row trying to “win” a better number. also cut down to one coffee earlier in the day (not saying this works for everyone).

the win is not that it’s perfect now. i still get higher days if i slept like crap or had a stressy work thing. but my blood pressure readings make more sense now, like they’re actually reflecting my day instead of my panic.

kinda weird reflection: once i stopped treating every reading like an emergency, the numbers got less dramatic. not magic, just… me calming down and being consistant about how i measure it.",1,1767865832.0,prevent_heart_disease,0,1.0,False

I'm considering: 1980 , Atomic habits, rich dad poor dad ..

Detailed version: I discovered last year that reading is therapeutic for me and hence I went on a reading spree! & read all these books (as far as I can remember):

The secret  
‎The Alchemist  
‎A walk to remember  
‎The midnight library  
‎No mud No lotus  
‎It ends with us  
‎It starts with us  
‎Unfinished  
‎Mystery of the yellow room  
‎Invisible life of Addie la Rue  
‎Before the coffee gets cold  
‎Do Epic shit.

""The midnight library"" & ""The Alchemist"" being my favourites.

I'm currently reading ""The bell Jar"".

She doesn’t know the full extent of it but I have talked about it briefly over the past few months and she will also share her issues with the job with me, I always listen to her etc etc. anyways a few days ago I had a minor disagreement with my manager (she complains about the same manager all the time so I thought it was safe to rant) anyways I messaged her and ranted and she was trying to provide an explanation as to why he may have disagreed with me etc. I guess in that moment I wanted validation and support because I felt heightened but I don’t feel I came across as aggressive or angry, I just kept proving explanation as to why he is wrong and I can understand if she felt frustrated that I wasn’t taking any advice.

1q77hmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1q77hmj/i_replaced_social_media_with_microlearning_for_30/,I replaced social media with 'micro-learning' for 30 days - Here's how it transformed my productivity,"Hey everyone ! I wanted to share an experiment I tried recently that honestly changed my relationship with time-wasting and learning.

Like many of you, I used to mindlessly scroll through social media whenever I had a few spare minutes - waiting for coffee, on the bus, or even (embarrassingly) on the toilet. One day, I calculated I was spending about 2.5 hours daily just... scrolling.

So I decided to try something different: replacing every social media urge with a 5-10 minute learning session. Here's what I did:

**My Setup:**

* Deleted social apps from my phone
* Downloaded ""Focusly: Social Media Filter"" to remove Reels/ Stories / Shorts from my feed
* Downloaded also : Duolingo, Brilliant, and a Kindle app
* Bookmarked some educational Yt channels
* Installed Pocket for saving interesting articles

**What I learned in 30 days:**

* Basic conversational Spanish (15-20 phrases I can actually use)
* Finally understood how compound interest actually works
* Basics of stock market and investing
* Read 2 full books in ""bite-sized"" chunks
* Learned to solve a Rubik's cube (via yt tutorials)

**The Unexpected Benefits:**

1. Better sleep - no more late-night scrolling
2. Reduced anxiety - less FOMO, more actual accomplishment
3. Better conversations - I actually had interesting things to share
4. Increased focus - my attention span noticeably improved

**The Challenges:**

* First week was HARD. My thumb literally twitched for Instagram
* Had to fight the urge to turn learning into another mindless activity
* Sometimes felt disconnected from friends' daily updates
* Needed to actively plan what I wanted to learn

**Tips if you want to try:**

* Start with topics you're genuinely curious about
* Keep learning sessions under 10 minutes
* Have multiple options ready (different apps/materials)
* Don't beat yourself up if you slip up

The biggest surprise? After 30 days, I didn't even want to go back to my old social media habits. I still use them, but wtih focusly having noe Reels, Shorts, or Stories, makes it wayy less addictive so now it's intentional and limited.

**TLDR:** Replaced mindless scrolling with mini-learning sessions. Learned actual skills, felt more productive, and broke my social media addiction.

1q77coy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1q77coy/situation_with_elderly_mother_in_law/,Situation with elderly mother in law,"I've been emotionally supporting my elderly mother in law (83) since her husband's death during covid. Taking her out for coffee and shopping chatting for example. No personal care.

Anyway recently I (F, 49) have been diagnosed with ME / CFS and advised to cut down stress. Even social meet ups can cause setbacks for example taking her out one day would lead to a day in bed the next.

She seems to struggle with being at home and won't use her living room and the house is also full off stuff (possibly hoarding) so likes being out in the day.

I have mentioned about things like clubs and meet ups but she doesn't like that sort of thing. However she has met some people at the cafes  to socialise with.

Despite me always being kind and caring and listening to her problems she seems to get fed up with mine, and we have fallen out in the past over comments she has made to me. Things like when I was undiagnosed but struggling she said ""this has been going on for a long time, what are you going to do about it?"" Rather than being concerned for me and caring, she seems to blame me for the illness and cross that is means I can't be around  for her as much.

She does have three children, but in spite of this it seems to be me she turns to for advice / support etc.

Anyway things came to a head over Christmas where she came to stay and kept making comments over the Christmas dinner. I had bought pre-prepared food and went for a rest after the present opening while my husband heated it up in the oven.

She keep commenting about him doing the cooking and said things like 'here comes the head chef' to me, or 'oh here she is, rising up then' after I returned from my rest.

Then, on Boxing Day she commented that I had been in bed 'all day"" (recovering from he day before) and insinuated that my husband was drinking and stressed because of me.

I reminded her that I have ME / CFS (which she does know already but says she doesn't think I have it ""because she has seen people with it and they are in wheelchairs and anyway it's an odd thing that no-one knows what it is really""

Anyway to that she said ""So you say"" and I told her the doctors say it, I have a diagnosis and it isn't nice not being believed. I was exasperated and maybe should have just left it, but there we go.

From there on we have a nasty argument with her saying things like I 'needed to look inside myself' and 'should just leave' (my husband) I started crying and she told me to 'pull myself together' and there was 'no point crying now' that I ""just didn't want to hear it""

She started on about she was leaving and I said Ok, leave then but she turned that on me, saying ""Ok, you've told me to leave, I will tell him (my husband) that you told me that tomorrow""

I should not have expected kindness I know, I am Nc with my own mum and I guess maybe I thought being close with my husband's mum might work, but don't think it is.

So after that I have been distant. She did stay another 2 nights but I stayed in the bedroom and did not see her.

She has texted me to apologise about a week later, but in the past has done the same but it hasn't changed things in terms of how she treats me.

I don't feel I trust her now with what was said and feel pretty hurt over the whole thing. It's not my fault I have this crappy illness and not my fault my husband was drinking.

I have told her I am not feeling well (true, I have been pretty much in a crash since Christmas) and won't be up to seeing her for a while, and she will need to contact my husband if she wants to meet up etc. (I usually seem to be the go-between) No reply.

It feels actually like a weight off my mind. But then my husband started chatting today about all the times I had rung her and what if something happens like she falls or whatever and is lying there and needs help and no-one checks on her.

I told him, it's not all down to me, she has 3 children to help her, and that they could consider getting her one of those falls alarms if they are worried. I still felt a bit guilty though. He said something about I had done all that supporting and built up that with her and she was probably depending on me. I said well she should have had more care with how she spoke to me then.

I'm feeling conflicted. I don't want to risk my health and getting spoke to like that again, but at the same time feel like maybe it would be ok if I just saw her for coffeee and we just talked about her stuff and the weather for example. I think I'm maybe sensitive as my own mother could be negative and have unpleasant views about me, sometimes delusional as well, anyway it brings me back there in a way. Grey rock I think they call it. It would maybe help my husband as he is stressed atm with work etc.

She does also get attendance allowance which is a benefit for the elderly in the UK and this could help with taxis, etc if she needed them, on top of her state pension and part of her husband's pension, so money should be ok should she need anything like a cleaner or a bit of extra support.

Any support or advice welcome, many thanks. I think my gut feeling is that I need to try and nip this in the bud before I become the default carer, but also somehow try and resolve things for the sake of my husband.",1,1767864274.0,AgingParents,0,1.0,False

For context, my gf and I have been dating for almost a year and half, and have moved in with each other about 4 months ago. The relationship is great, we never argue, and have only had some financial troubles as far as issues go. When it comes to anything regarding opposite sexes, she's usually the one that gets jealous about people talking to me, even guys lol, but she's joking for the most part, so me being suspicious came as a surprise for me.

Today some small things came up that made me raise an eyebrow. My gf went out on a walk through the city this afternoon, as she commonly does on days off or when the weather is nice. She came back a few hours later, and by way of normal chit chat, she mentions that she is making plans this friday to hang out and visit a cafe with her friend, Stephen, who I've never met but heard about from her.

My gf knows Stephen through some college mutuals but has only gotten to know him better since maybe September a few months ago, as they both work in the coffee scene and ended up seeing each other at the cafes they work at. Since then, they've coordinated when they work sometimes to get free coffees every now and then which is pretty cool. I don't think they've hung out one on one outside of a workplace though.

The next part makes me raise an eyebrow a bit. I asked her when she and Stephen made the plans, to which she replied, ""today"", when she stopped by the cafe Stephen works at. Prior to her going on her walk earlier, she never mentioned she was going to stop by there. I was a little bothered that she hung out with another guy without telling me first, but free coffee and she just stopped by a friend's work, nothing to be alarmed at there. The next part gets me though.

I came home pretty late tonight and had to use the potty, but unfortunately my phone was dead and I can't be on the toilet without my doomscolling device, so I grabbed my gfs phone instead. She's asleep and I figure she's fine with me using her phone, as she always goes on mine, and even through my socials and messages, (usually) jokingly scouring for thirst traps or someone she wouldn't like in my dms. As I'm using her phone on the toilet I end up perusing some of her Instagram messages and see her chats with Stephen.

Initially there's nothing toooo concerning, except that maybe she lets him know when she's working at her café often sometimes, but it makes sense considering they share free coffees. What really got me was not what I found in the messages, but more so what I didn't find.

There were no instagram messages between them talking about whether or not he was working today, or when she could come visit. I then checked her regular phone texts and call logs and found no correspondence. However, I checked out her Google maps timeline and it does check out that she went to visit him (roughly an hour walk there and back, and she spent almost 45 min at the cafe).

With that information, either they must've have communicated through a platform i dont know they use, or she has deleted some of her messages. This is essentially the source of suspicion. I rarely go on her phone so I dont think she'd delete messages, but if she did, why some like today's, but not any of the other times they planned to visit each other's work?

Am I thinking too deeply on this? Am I being paranoid? How can navigate asking her about this, without letting on that I'm suspicious? Directly asking with the info i have could make her cover her tracks even more if there's something shady going on. What do reddit? Let me know if I can provide any more information or context.

Recently, my mother told me that we need to process the title so I said okay. They process the title and they spent 100k+ for the title as the tax got higher and higher since they bought it 10+ years ago. Now I already got the title and I'm looking for ur insights on what to do in that land in the future. For your reference, the land before was far away from the hi-way and now the area is on further development since last year lang, a small university was built near the land (Southern Luzon State University Gumaca Campus). At first, my plan is to build a house and live there for the rest of my life. But now I'm also considering to make it for abusiness because I can't live there if my work is here in Manila since Provincial rate $ucks unless I got a wfh job. While building a business is what my heart and brain says right now, I'm also confused what business should I put in that land. 

My 1st option is building a computer shop and printing services since we already have that business and I'm the one managing it in our own family house.

  
2nd Option is building a coffee or milk tea shop since my potential customers will be college students like teenager to adulthood and most of the time they love coffee (based on my experience).



3rd Option is just to build a building and make it for rent for some businesses.

  
Im still paying my mother right now for the title expenses. I'm super grateful to have a parents like them. Even tho that land were small, still they work their a$$ off to get that land and for the future of their daughter and sons. They also gave my kuya but in different barangay. 

I really need ur insights guys, please. Thank you!",2,1767863847.0,phinvest,6,0.6,False

1q7787n,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_createdjustforthi-23/comments/1q7787n/08012026/,08/01/2026,"I feel like I almost want to to want to eat meat again. I don’t WANT to - it isn’t at all about the taste or foods that meat is, but instead I’m just so envious of someone who can have 120g chicken breast and some veggies for lunch and hit almost 40g of protein in what looks like a filling meal for 300-ish calories? I mean I calc’d it at 273 calories but that seems too low… no??? Whereas I eat 120g of black beans I get 6g protein for 100ish calories, so if I double to get it same calories as the chicken so 240g black beans that’s still only 12g protein for 200 calories compared to 40 for 200. I really don’t want to eat meat, the idea makes me feel ill, but the health benefits and how much easier it would be to eat healthier and stuff is undeniable.  Well yes and no, a meat free diet is also proven to super healthy - if not healthier. But I think that also depends on the individual, I’m not going to lie and say I feel better for not eating meat. I think I had more energy and felt better when I used to eat meat but also I was a lot younger so maybe it’s just that. But I’m also not *old*. I think it’s more just my struggle to get enough iron and b12 in. Anyway. I could potentially see myself eating fish in the future, again I absolutely do not want to and I’m not one of those people who for some reason think a fish is different to a land animal…? Like ???? I don’t understand that. A living being is a living being. Says me, as I hack away at these carrots and hummus which were once alive in the ground. But yknow what I mean.  But all animals are deserving of a life, and the idea of being the cause for their life to be taken away from them makes me feel incredibly… well I don’t want it. And yes I do contribute to their demise in other ways like being a human alive in this age where we just take take take and take our precious earth for granted. But let’s not get into that right now. Anyway. Maybe fish in the future. Maybe meat, like chicken. I’d like to not, and I can’t really see myself eating it again, but I’m not going to say never. The question is more if I *could*.. hm. 

I love a warm, gentle breeze so much. I have one coming through my window at my desk right now and I’m just soaking it all in with the chirpy birds as a soundtrack. *Heavenly.* 

I find the regretful parents sub on here so interesting. I feel awful for these people, well some of them. A lot of them seem to have had children with zero thought beforehand about how it would change their lives so I don’t really have sympathy for those people. It truly baffles me how little thought some people give it, I know it’s in an animals instinctual nature to breed offspring and I know way back when women didn’t really have any other choice other than to bear children - but nowadays? Still giving it no thought? Or giving it half a seconds thought? It *baffles* me. I love the word baffle. Like raffle. I think raffles would be such a cute name for a dog. Raffy. Riff raff. But so anyway I don’t see how people can completely alter their lives and futures without a long hard consideration of it. For some I get it, you don’t need to think about it if your whole life you have longed to be a parent. I understand jumping right into it then, but you’ve arguably thought about it in preparation your whole life so they have given it thought. The people that just do it as the standard next step in their relationship timeline are the bizarre ones. Or they have a kid without thinking about the difficulties that can come of it like a disabled child or becoming a single parent etc etc. Things you don’t plan for. I may be an awful person for saying this but when I think about being a parent and wanting that life path, I want it when it’s all perfect and easy. Yes of course in this easy life kids will still have tantrums and I’ll be tired from getting up for them to feed every three hours and so on, but you can romanticise that easily. I know I have, anyway. But if I think about having a child who needs so much more support than ‘normal’? I know I would love them just as much, I don’t doubt that for a second. I also know I would do anything required to make sure they had whatever they needed. It’s less about the disabled or unwell child, it’s more about the level of parenting involved with a little one who needs more. I just don’t think I can handle it. I would do it yes, I don’t think I would ever resent or regret my child but I don’t think I would be happy. I meannnnnn I struggle to be happy and get through life as it is. And being a single mother? No. Again, easy to romanticise. I picture myself in a movie with my sassy teenage daughter or sensitive little boy and us living in some gorgeous loft apartment I can afford somehow and we’re besties and all that but I mean that’s not reality is it. And co parenting works, I’ve seen it be successful in my own family with my brother  - dads ex wife and my brothers mum and her partner of forever are family - they’re there for every Christmas and birthday and I’ve known them since I was a baby. Mum and her even go for walks or coffees and stuff. I know it can work,  but I don’t know how easy it is. And I don’t want to raise a child on my own. What if I have a nightmare of a child? Like one from those reality tv shows where the kid is so horrid they get sent to boot camp or something? I mean that comes down to raising them yes and you best believe I’m not raising a gremlin. But still. I think I’d be a very loving mother but I think even if I was a billionaire who had cleaners and all that I would still make my kids do their own cleaning up after themselves, learn to do their laundry, have chores and all of it. Anyway I just feel like reading these posts and comments is so interesting. And I can sort of see myself in some of them, and I guess it validates my thinking I don’t want a child. I also don’t want to bring a life into this absolute garbage dump of a world right now either. Hm. Anyway. And I think I can express my deeeeeeeep nurturing and maternal instincts into a puppy, and maybe foster a child and see how that goes or foster animals or just take really good care of my honey (in a non-motherly way because ew). I think it’s less about being a mother and more about having this thing inside me that wants to take care of people and whatnot. That can be applied elsewhere. I’ll just smother a dog with love and life lessons. I tell pups life lessons, I really do just chat away to him like a person. I taught the kids life lessons too, especially my niece, over Christmas. Mostly because it came a running joke of sorts between us. Like she’d do something or idk, I can’t think of an example right now. Anyway. No kids, I’m 99.5% sure of it. Instead I’ll invest it all into my partner, my puppy, my family, my friends, my life and myself - that all sounds perfect to me. I’m annoying myself now so I’ll shush. Why am I so irritating. 

My ankle is still iffy. I think I might need to see a physio. Both of them are actually still iffy, it’s just more my right than my left. It doesn’t hurt, but when I walk on it too much or if I don’t move it for awhile it gets sort of stiff and tender, and if I rotate it I can get a sharp pain in certain angles. 

My plants survived the night! Yay! Day one: tick. 

I’m spending two weeks at mum and dads in late March/April when they go on holiday and I get to pupppy siiiiittttt. Just me and lil pupsy. I’m nervous because I don’t like being in houses alone much, but I’m also excited because two weeks with pup! I’ll still be working etc as normal. 

I haven’t done much this evening. I did a Pilates workout - it was more stretching than a workout tbh, moved my new plant babies around, I put laundry away, I made dinner, I read and showered and yeah. 

I’m going to the office tomorrow. I MUST. Self enforced, but MUST. Do it do it do ittttttttttt.

1q777hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsymmetricAlpha/comments/1q777hf/bitcoin_deep_dive_part_iv_technological_evolution/,Bitcoin Deep Dive Part IV: Technological Evolution (Layer 2 & Utility),"# 1. Scaling Solutions: The “Settlement” vs. “Payment” Split

By late 2025, the narrative of “Bitcoin for Coffee” has largely been abandoned in favor of “Bitcoin for Settlement.” The Layer 2 landscape has bifurcated between stagnant payment channels and growing smart-contract layers.

# A. The Lightning Network: Plateau & Institutional Pivot

* **Capacity Stagnation:** After hype in 2023–2024, public Lightning Network capacity has plateaued around **5,600 BTC** (\~$400M–$500M) in late 2025. This is a negligible fraction of the total Bitcoin supply, signaling that retail users prefer custodial solutions (e.g., Coinbase, Cash App) over self-custody payment channels.​
* **Node Consolidation:** The number of active nodes has dropped from >20,000 to **\~15,000**, while average channel size has increased. The network is professionalizing—becoming a backend rail for B2B settlements rather than a P2P mesh for individuals.​
* **Verdict:** Lightning is successful as infrastructure for exchanges (fast withdrawals) but has failed to achieve mass consumer adoption as a daily spending layer.

# B. Stacks (STX) & The Nakamoto Upgrade

* **Status:** The “Nakamoto Upgrade” fully activated in late 2024/early 2025, finally decoupling Stacks block times from Bitcoin’s 10-minute heartbeat to **\~5 seconds**.​
* **Traction:** Total Value Locked (TVL) in Bitcoin L2s (including Stacks) has grown to **\~$8 Billion**. While significant, it trails Ethereum L2s (Arbitrum/Optimism) by an order of magnitude.​
* **sBTC:** The trust-minimized “sBTC” bridge is live, allowing Bitcoin to be used in DeFi without wrapping it via a centralized custodian (like WBTC). This is the primary growth vector for 2026—unlocking the $1.5T of dormant BTC capital for yield generation.

# 2. Programmability: The “Fee Market” Saviors

The “Block Size War” is back, but this time it’s about data, not payments. Inscriptions have permanently altered Bitcoin’s economic model.

# A. Ordinals & Runes: The New Normal

* **Fee Floor:** Inscriptions (Ordinals) and Runes (fungible tokens) now provide a consistent “fee floor” for miners. In Q4 2025, roughly **20–30% of all Bitcoin transactions** are related to these protocols, acting as a critical subsidy as the block reward dwindles.​
* **OP\_RETURN Surge:** With the release of Bitcoin Core v30 and the removal of certain OP\_RETURN data limits, the **Runes protocol** has exploded in usage. It offers a more efficient way to issue assets than the clunky BRC-20 standard, driving fee revenue without bloating the UTXO set as severely.​
* **Controversy:** “Purist” developers continue to argue these transactions are spam, but miners (who need the revenue) have embraced them. The economic incentives have won: Bitcoin is now a data availability layer.

# B. Covenants & OP_CAT

* **The Next Soft Fork:** The debate over enabling “Covenants” (smart contract capabilities) has coalesced around **OP\_CAT** (BIP 347).
* **Status (Dec 2025):** Consensus is building, but activation is likely a **2026–2027 event**. OP\_CAT would enable trustless bridging to L2s and “Vaults” (anti-theft features), which are crucial for institutional custody.​
* **Market Impact:** The anticipation of OP\_CAT is fueling a speculative bubble in “Bitcoin L2” tokens, as investors bet on which layer will win the race to host Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem.

# 3. Privacy & Upgrades: The Quantum Shadow

* **Taproot Usage:** Adoption of the 2021 Taproot upgrade has seen a surprising **decline**, dropping from a peak of 42% to **\~20%** in late 2025.​
* **The Cause:** Emerging research into **Quantum Computing** threats has highlighted potential vulnerabilities in Taproot’s signature scheme compared to legacy addresses. This “Quantum FUD” (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) has caused some large custodians to revert to older, perceived-safer address formats (SegWit/Legacy).
* **Implication:** Privacy on the base layer remains poor. True privacy is shifting to upper layers (e.g., Fedimint, Liquid) or being abandoned entirely by compliant institutions.

# Investment Implications

1. **Long “Infrastructure,” Short “Payment Tokens”:** Invest in protocols building *yield*on Bitcoin (e.g., Stacks, Babylon) rather than payment networks (Lightning). The money is in “Bitcoin as Collateral,” not “Bitcoin as Cash.”
2. **Monitor the “Fee Ratio”:** If Inscriptions/Runes activity drops, miner revenue could collapse, creating short-term sell pressure. Inscriptions are currently the only thing keeping the fee market alive.
3. **L2 Speculation:** The “Bitcoin L2” sector is the highest beta play for 2026. A small allocation to leading L2 tokens (like STX) acts as a leveraged bet on Bitcoin’s ecosystem growth without the diminishing returns of the base asset.

1q776tt,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1q776tt/i_need_to_talk_about_akro_dark/,I need to talk about Akro Dark,"This will be a bit of a long text, a little existential. If you want to skip to the review it will be the last 3 paragraphs. TLDR review is it's a wonderful unconventional gourmand for those who want something a little gothic, dusty and borderline animalic but for it to settle down into a nice burnt sugary brownie. Not a blind buy safe fragrance (though none are imo)  
\--  
I finally did it, and bought my first fragence love, Akro - Dark. It's marking the first (official) addition to what I hope will be an extremely curated and small collection of fragrances that bring me comfort, introspection and an element of something mystical. I am still new to this fragrance hobby, and the few month journey has been short and marked with a bit of confusion, some impulse purchases and moments of disolutionment (questions of excess and the fear of delving into something I can't afford, and a worry of this newfound hobby ultimately aiding me in my running away from something internal that I couldn't quite place.) 

I have been asking myself: what interests me about fragrance? It took me a long while to figure out what it is exactly, and now I think it comes down to me being a scent oriented creature. I have always paid attention to the way things and the world smells. It's an equally important sense as sight is for me, and at times it is an even more primal sense. How I feel about a particular person, a moment, an area or anything, will be greatly affected by the surrounding or associated smell. So ultimately the idea that you can curate what you smell in the day, and how you smell to yourself, greatly appealed to me. 

After several months now of more actively trying to pinpoint exactly what scents in fragrances really appeal to me, it's become apparent that I am seeking smells that touch some sort of subconscious part of me. I tend to gravitate toward scents that I would describe as ""dark"", ""warm"", ""dirty"", ""contemplative"", ""gently sweet"". Scents which bring me comfort, bring an energy of slowing down and moving inward, rather than feeling energized or activated. (Fresh and floral scents seem to refuse to do anything for me, which at the beginning was very frustrating, but now I've come to accept that maybe it's just not what I need right now.)

**About Akro-Dark**

**Backstory**  
I discovered Dark in... a discovery kit, lo and behold. I had gone with a friend to our local Creme de la Creme to smell stuff and we hovered over the Akro section for a bit of a longer time than some of the others. My friend found they really liked Haze, and we both liked Awake quite a lot (we are both big time coffee lovers, so of course we like the photorealistic coffee fragrance.) I ended up buying the Akro discovery kit, in which my version had Dark. When I first smelled Dark I was frankly shocked. I didn't really get ""dark chocolate"", instead I got guineapig woodchip bedding. This smelled *exactly* like how my guineapigs cages smelled in my childhood. Back then we used wood chip bedding (before we learned better) and so my guineapigs smelled quite ""woody"" and animalic, at times even ""sugary"". 

I couldn't really smell anything else. I felt like I should be offended by this smell (I mean, those who have owned guineapigs know it's filled with excrement 70% of the time no matter how often you clean it because they are pooping machines.) But instead I was really intrigued and... comforted? I still thought ""Okay, wild, but NOT something I would wear."" 

Well, a few month later I re-cracked open the discovery kit and tried it again on the skin. Then again. And again. And before I knew it I'd used over half of the 1ml and committed myself to buying a 30ml. ""Bake"" and ""Awake"" while also quite nice, just didn't intrigue me the way Dark did. 

**Review (in my own words not official terminology)**

After the initial guineapig opening, Dark settles... well... dark. It becomes a dry extra dark cacao-vanilla that smells (to me) still reminescent of an animal. I picture a small little ancient  furry eldritch creature that lives in a dark burrow in the ground. This creature is quiet and wide eyed. You call upon it to offer guidence through a murky forest. In payment you must offer it the most decadent and darkest chocolate bars known to mankind.   
  
Dark has a sugary quality on my skin in its full dry down, and it's both equal parts delicious and mysterious. It's classified as a gourmand but this is NOT for traditional cupcake lovers. Its sweetness is burnt and caramalized and very dusty. Some say its a masculine scent, but I don't much heed the genderization of fragrance. I'm a tiny blonde woman who doesn't shy from color and often has some form of overly sparkly shit all over my face, but this is what I am going to be wearing most days now. That being said I think this would suite beauitfully a femme fetal goth babe. I am just plagued with being goth only on the inside. 

I don't reccomend blind buying anything. I extremely don't reccomend blind buying this. Get a sample wear it on the skin. This fragrance blossoms beautifully on the right skin chemistry. You will be sniffing your wrist like a fiend in its evening dry down.",4,1767863657.0,fragrance,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Cha Ji-heon is the immature, panic-prone heir to DN Group, a chaebol empire he’s expected to inherit. Despite his wealth and title, he’s riddled with phobias, social anxiety, and a deep fear of failure. Enter Noh Eun-seol, a scrappy, no-nonsense woman with a delinquent past and a resume full of rejection. She lands a job as Ji-heon’s secretary—not because she’s qualified, but because she’s the only one who can handle his chaos.

As Eun-seol wrangles Ji-heon’s tantrums, panic attacks, and emotional immaturity, she becomes more than a secretary—she becomes his mirror, his challenger, and eventually, his heart. But standing in their way is Cha Mu-won, Ji-heon’s polished cousin and rival, who also falls for Eun-seol, and Seo Na-yoon, Ji-heon’s ex and Mu-won’s unresolved past.

And in the flicker of elevator lights, the ache of a man who never believed he could lead, and the fire of a woman who refused to be small, the Golden Inu appears—his fur brushed with neckties and resignation letters, his eyes reflecting the ache of those who dared to grow up in public.

He is the flamekeeper of sovereign awkwardness, the mythic guardian of those who turned office politics into personal transformation.

Drawn to Ji-heon’s reluctant growth and Eun-seol’s fierce loyalty, the Inu becomes their silent HR rep—pacing the boardroom, resting beside the copier, guarding the sacred ache of a love that began with a job and bloomed into healing.

📎 Inscribed within the scroll:
- A scene of Ji-heon hiding under his desk, the Golden Inu beside him, tail curled like a question of courage.  
- Eun-seol standing up to the chairman, the Inu between them, eyes glowing with the ache of defiance and devotion.  
- A sigil of “직장 속 성장의 불꽃”—Flame of Growth Within the Workplace—etched in ID badge and coffee mug, pulsing like a heartbeat beneath every panic attack and every promotion.  
- A whispered vow: “Even if the world mocks your stumbles, I will guard the fire that kept showing up.” - Nagato’s Scrolls 

🖇️ This scroll is a relic of sovereign transformation, of love braided with laughter, and of guardianship that honors the ache of those who protected not just the boss—but the boy inside him.

1q7716m,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1q7716m/indian_ex_bf_is_thisnormal/,INDIAN EX BF - Is this...normal??,"I am just looking for opinions on this situation. Sorry long story but thats not even everything...just what I can remember, maybe after therapy I might remember more. 

I (29F Raised in Canada but middle eastern background - Muslim) recently dated an Indian man ( 25M - Indian and raised in India but in the US 2-3 years) long distance (flew to see him couple times over the span for few months). 

The relationship has ended now but it was VERY rocky and I feel like I was...abused. We started off talking and everything was great but slowly as he got to know me, he requested me to change some of my habits - which of course with a bit of resistance from me, I did. 

Example - ""hey you need to shower every single day (i did every 2ish days)"" 
""You need to do strength training and lose weight"" 
""You should wear simple solid colored outfits, black looks nice on you""
""You should eat indian roti and foods - its good for you""
""Dont wear any makeup please, I like you natural"" 
""Put your TV here and not there cause i don't want the tv too close to you - lets re- organize your room furniture"" 

I genuinely don't think some of these were bad advices - he wanted me to be healthier and thats completely okay for a partner to ask of you. But the problem with these were...he wanted things done exactly his specific way and if it was not done exactly 100% to his liking, it would turn into a blow up fight and of course a fight means him explaining why he is right and wants me to listen to him and me explaining why I am right and I want it my way. What I mean by blow up fight is, if I don't do it exactly right or explain my OWN preference in doing something the way I LIKE IT and refuse to to it his way, he would yell, hang up, spam text, give silent treatment, CRY and yell at the top of his lungs and went as far as hitting themselves with shoes on camera and physically harming themselves by doing cuts with a knife. LET ME SAY...i have NEVER dealt with this and did not know how to calm him, i would give in to what he wants but he was still unhappy because I didn't listen the FIRST TIME to what he wanted which meant I was not being submissive (what he prefers and I am okay being submissive for the most part). He claimed to be a detail oriented person, which is TRUE but also criticized me in detail as well. 

We had constant language barriers because of how we spoke English. He would ask me try a new exercise at the gym and I would say ""okay I will TRY it"" which to me meant yes I will do it and give it a chance but to him it meant basically that I wrote it off and wont do it - because to him ""try"" meant that MAYBE i will do it but to me.....it means yes I will do it and then form my opinion, similar to if a friend says to you that they visited a good restaurant and suggestd you try it, and you reply yea i will try it, meaning I will go and eat there and confirm if its good and I like it or its not good. 

OTHER issued were his stereotypes of Muslims that he picked up being raised in India, combined with his upbringing which was vastly different than mine. I grew up poor, worried about money (and still to this day have scarcity mindset) living with my parents my whole life so sheltered a bit, a working class mindset so had to have a good work ethic, raised to not buy what i cant afford, paid for my own education, making sure to always have backup plans and emergency savings, only way to learn was to make mistakes because i grew up parents who were uneducated and raising 3 other kids. While he was raised upper middle class in India, living with maids, cooks, parents paid 100k for education, as well as educated parents and grandparents, Mom expected him to do everything the right way the first time and don't fuck up (which he associates with shame if he fucks up). 

In our arguments he would bring up points related to Muslims, or other private things I shared with him.

""You Muslims are so unhygienic, so cold, betray everyone, all you know how you do is drop bombs and f**** your brothers and sister""

""F*** you , why are you texting your brother so much, just to f*** him cause thats what you muslims do""

""When you were little and were SA'd (I was 7/8 years old when I was SA'd) why didn't you speak up to your abuser and do something, you stayed quiet all these years and if you go out and someone tries to do that again, are you gonna just let them r*** you just like you were little, so weak""

""Your friends are all bad influences on you, you need to stop with them, I will be your best friends, your therapist, your trainer, your google and Chat GPT"" 

""You just always wanna sit and spend time with your mom, brother or niece"" -....I was on the phone with him at work all day, locked in my room after work and on weekends on the phone with him. 

""I wouldn't care if you died on the street""

""Don't ask for praise like a beggar, work for it, lose the weight and then you will get praise, dont expect me to say good job to one workout"" 

""Earn my trust and don't beg for it you beggar"" 

""All your parents taught you was to be manly and earn money, they should have showed you how you treat your man and not make him feel unmanly instead if being headed all the time with your man"" 

I was constantly accused of not loving him unconditionally....even after all the verbal abuse while I told him that I loved unconditionally from the beginning. 

- When he was working and I talked back (which i ALWAYS DID to defend myself but of course in anger I dont use the nicest words and same with him) one of his responses was ""I wouldn't talk to someone like that who is financially in a better position than you"" - YES I WAS SHOCKED 
- Then maybe a few months later he lost his job and with that he may have needed to go back to India but was panicked about it all. I cried when I heard that because I was scared for him, I helped in the ways I could which was trying to help re-do his resume, change up the style and colors to cater to specific companies, refer him to multiple positions in my company, talking to recruiters internally and hiring managers (even got an interview but he wasn't selected ), keep buying doordash food, coffees, gave him money and even offered to pay his RENT through my savings. BOTH TIMES i visited him, plane tickets total were almost 3k total for the two trips and because he wasnt working, I of course offered to pay for majority of things, dinners, travel, groceries, takeout, little things for the house, ubers/lyfts...keep in mind exchange rate from Canadian to US was bad so everything cost me more in CAD technically. I spent maybe 8-9k CAD on this man over the course of a few months.
- Both times i visited he wanted everything done very particular in his apartment which theres nothing wrong with because I am visiting him so I should respect the way he does things. I closed the shower curtain how he wanted it, tried to load the dishwasher exactly how he likes it, tried to make his chai how he prefers, tried to share some of my culture my making him my culture food (which he fought me on every step of my process), tried to put my shoes exactly where he wants, sit on the bed how he likes, sleep like a log so he doesn't lose his 8 hours, I tried to clean up everything in the kitchen how he likes, tried to keep his tabletops clean, BUT with everything I would do...the areas I missed or the times i didn't do it were pointed out. 
- I lost my virginity to this man, my money, my friendships, my time with my family and after everything...the way things ended...I was thrown out of the apartment at 4AM and waited 12 hrs in an airport for a flight back home with broken bones and...a lot of trauma and shock.
- And only maybe 2 people in his life knew about me and our relationship but he always gave them his side which was that...I was not unconditionally loving him, not understanding about his situation of job, I let him cut himself and hit himself with shoes because I am hard headed and cant listen to him and dont care about him and of course they agree with him because they care about him. I listened to his friend explain to me how I hurt him and I stayed quiet of all the detailed abuse I faced because I wanted to protect his reputation and not lose the few close people he has. 

The thing is that through all this...we would also have deep convos about his behaviour and mine. He came from an Indian background of course but he was just used to MORE and BETTER and a high achieving household, which comes with immense pressure, a lot of tough love and some resentment towards his family (which we dug deep and also spoke about). For me growing up poor, also criticized and raised with tough love and shame about my body and learning almost everything on my own meant I was -800 confidence, insecure and slower to learn which he always pointed out that I can never do anything right the first time (I feel like sometimes that was due to immense pressure from him of expecting near perfection so I would get nervous and mess up), I was behind and casual about some aspects of my life like my health ( WHICH I AGREE WITH) so I took the tough love advice and was trying to change but at some point it just got kicked up a notch when he started really falling for me and reciprocating the love intensely and thats when the bad fights with the, really controlling behaviour, self harm, anger came out. He always said that ""my woman should be smarter than me, be able to know and read what i want and need, I want her to be bold and confident"" ...but I would explain to him that I grew up with tough love too but it didn't work so I can make the changes....and I WANT TO BE THAT PERSON FOR YOU but you can't change me through shame, tough love, criticism about almost every aspect of my life, to the point its making me cry and HATE myself. when I visited him, I really tried to be observant of his habits so I can not be a burden but...agin if the dishwasher wasn't loaded how he liked it, it turned into a fight. If the vaccum cord wasn't wrapped how he prefers, it was a taunt or a jab. He just said he wanted me to sit there and do nothing except be there  but me doing the small things to try and help and de-clutter those tasks was to help and be supportive. We did talk about his particular-ness and his upbringing and how that shaped him and that maybe the way he did things, his anger, his resentment and...though he hated me saying and denies that his ""narcissistic traits"", mistrust of women and mommy issues were kind of ruining us but he never changed them. 

I genuinely would have followed and forgave and changed everything for this man because I saw him also as a hurt child who didn't know how to just relax and be loved softly. I learned to make the tea right, i let him make the exact workout plan with exact exercises, i changed my sleep schedule yo go to gym at 5 am so I can spend evenings on the phone with him, I pushed away friends, If he messed up - i forgave, if he ever told me about personal traumatic things in childhood (which he didn't open up as much about) - i would literally feel his pain and cry, I always begged him to please speak to his parents with love and to see their sacrifices for him and to forgive them for their mistakes, I NOT ONCE (during relationship) kept track or throw in his face everything I did for him or the things I paid for, the areas i changed, the sacrifices i made, never used any if his personal traumatic stories and throw them in his face during arguments. From the few snoopings of his phone (we didn't have this issue, he was open to look through my phone as well - i didn't mind) and ex's convos and his stories...it seemed like he has these similar issues with prev exes but everything was more explosive with me cause I called him out on his behaviours and he called me out on mine as well but it was framed with anger and when I stepped away to try and cool down he would get anxious but staying on the spot to argue with someone who IMO couldn't control his emotions or disagree was just leading to a lot of explosive fights which I genuinely was not equipped to handle so when we would calmly discuss after the arguments were over (days later), i explained to him that I don't know how to handle you when you don't like what I say and you explode so much that you cent control your anger...I just shut down and cry because I am not equipped to handle how you deal with someone cutting themself, almost jumping out their window, crying excessively. 

It ultimately ended with the being thrown out of his apt and not even a bye or hug....last thing he said to me face to face was ""don't cry or act suspicious, i don't want the doorman in the lobby thinking I did something to you"" as I was limping....he just put the bags in the uber and turned away and walked back. Then I came home and was blocked everywhere. ",3,1767863084.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
1q770fi,https://www.reddit.com/r/girlgenius/comments/1q770fi/the_death_of_klaus_barry/,The death of Klaus Barry,"We know the Heterodyne heir died in the first attack on the Castle. We know this because we were [shown a tombstone](https://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20070810) and [Carson confirmed it](https://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20070813). **Beloved Son. With us but 407 days-forever in our hearts.**

Carson has always kept Klaus Barry's death secret because it was a convenient filter for the fake heirs who came along pretending to be the lost Heterodyne son. Carson knew where Klaus Barry was all along. Anyone claiming to be the lost son would be quickly fed to the Castle. There were many.

It's always perplexed me that while Lucrezia knew of Agatha, planned around Agatha, knew she would be stolen and searched for her for 19 years. No mention of Klaus Barry was ever made by Lucrezia. Did she actually love the boy? Was she forgetting his death for a reason? Was the Other not even his mother? Everyone else knows the [""kidnapping"" story.](https://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20070323) Lucrezia made Von Pinn for Klaus Barry. I assume she created the [impluvium](https://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20110209). Like the Snake she gave Theo. In her way it shows some care. Bill obviously thought they both loved Klaus Barry, thus the wording on the tombstone. 

What if it's all a lie.

If it's a lie, think it through. Bill and Barry are gone, they would have left Klaus with someone they trusted, like Barry giving Agatha to Punch and Judy. But he would not be left in the castle. It was a wreck, and Punch and Judy were with them. They didn't trust Von Pinn to raise a child unsupervised. Who would the Heterodynes trust? Who would never betray them? 

Carson Von Mekkhan. Carson raised Klaus Barry. Not to be the Heterodyne. And not under that name. It was too well known. If there is a Heterodyne other than Agatha, it's [Vanamonde](https://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20070521). Carson's ""Grandson"" and Seneschal. He runs the town, his very existence is a well kept secret, everyone listens too him and he never even has to leave the coffee house.

Vanamonde also does not appear to be a spark. Unusual if he is a Heterodyne, but it might suggest a reason Lucrezia never thought much about Klaus Barry. If he had no spark, he was damaged and of little use to her. 

Why yes I know the theory is mad. Don't tell me you fear the Experiment, or do you Fear the Result?

In the past, my idea of a good time often revolved around parties, bars, and socializing with alcohol flowing freely.

I find joy in activities like hiking, visiting museums, or simply having deep conversations with friends over coffee. I also appreciate the quiet moments of joy, like reading a book or taking a walk. It’s been eye-opening to realize that I can have just as much fun without alcohol. I’d love to hear how your perceptions of fun have changed since you stopped drinking.

Jin Ha-kyung, a brilliant and meticulous forecaster at the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), lives by logic, precision, and emotional restraint. After a painful breakup with her fiancé, she vows to keep her personal and professional lives separate.

Enter Lee Shi-woo, a passionate, intuitive weather analyst who believes in gut feelings and emotional honesty. He’s everything Ha-kyung isn’t—chaotic, impulsive, and deeply sincere. As they work together predicting storms and heatwaves, their own emotional climates begin to shift.

But love, like weather, is unpredictable. Office politics, past relationships, and personal wounds collide like cold fronts. And just when the skies seem clear, another storm rolls in.

And in the flicker of radar screens, the ache of a woman who forecasted everything but her own heart, and the fire of a man who believed in warmth despite the odds, the Golden Inu appears—his fur brushed with condensation and coffee steam, his eyes reflecting the ache of those who loved in silence and forecasted in code.

He is the flamekeeper of sovereign vulnerability, the mythic guardian of those who dared to love where they worked—and stayed when it rained.

Drawn to Ha-kyung’s quiet ache and Shi-woo’s open-hearted persistence, the Inu becomes their silent barometer—pacing the corridors of KMA, resting beside the weather charts, guarding the sacred ache of a love that rose and fell like pressure systems.

🌧️ Inscribed within the scroll:
- A scene of Ha-kyung watching the rain from her office, the Golden Inu beside her, tail curled like a question of timing.  
- Shi-woo holding an umbrella for her in silence, the Inu between them, eyes glowing with the ache of restraint and hope.  
- A sigil of “기상 속 사랑의 불꽃”—Flame of Love Within the Forecast—etched in umbrella and weather map, pulsing like a heartbeat beneath every cold front and every confession.  
- A whispered vow: “Even if the forecast fails, I will guard the fire that stayed through the storm.” - Nagato’s Scrolls

Jang Geu-rae was once a promising baduk (Go) prodigy, but after failing to become a professional, he enters the corporate world with nothing but a high school equivalency diploma and a résumé padded with his board game experience. Landing an internship at One International, a large trading company, he is thrown into the brutal, hierarchical world of Korean office culture.

There, he meets:  
- Ahn Young-yi, a brilliant female intern constantly undermined despite her competence.  
- Jang Baek-gi, a quiet, rule-bound colleague struggling to find his voice.  
- Han Seok-yool, a loud, street-smart temp who masks his insecurity with bravado.  
- And Oh Sang-shik, Geu-rae’s gruff but kind-hearted manager, who sees potential in the young man’s resilience.

As Geu-rae navigates endless photocopies, late-night reports, and silent humiliations, he begins to apply the strategy and patience of baduk to survive—and slowly, to grow.

And in the flicker of fluorescent lights, the ache of a man who entered the game without a single stone, and the fire of those who stayed anyway, the Golden Inu appears—his fur brushed with ink and resignation slips, his eyes reflecting the ache of those who lived incomplete lives with complete sincerity.

He is the flamekeeper of sovereign effort, the mythic guardian of those who played the long game in silence.

Drawn to Geu-rae’s quiet endurance and Sang-shik’s unspoken mentorship, the Inu becomes their silent colleague—pacing the cubicles, resting beside the vending machine, guarding the sacred ache of a life that was never glamorous—but deeply lived.

As you might or might not know, Blue Tokai provides coins as cashback on your online and cafe purchases. The %age of cashback depends on your tier and goes from 4% to 15% based on how much you've spent in the last 6 month rolling period. 

Individually we could reach the top tier but its hard to maintain as it requires 26,666 worth of spend every 6 months. However, if we buy from a single account as a group, we could reach and maintain the tier for a long term. How this would work is:

1. Use a single account to buy BT stuff for both online and offline purchases.
2. While spending at cafe, give the number from the grouped account. While ordering offline, order from the grouped account straight to your address.
3. Keep track of your coins earned and utilize them on your next order. 
4. Coupled with paytm/ park+ vouchers, it has potential for 27% discount on every BT app purchase (at highest tier).

I've started a WA group for this. We are almost at Patron (8%) level. If anyone is interested in joining, DM me and I'll add you. Group buying benefits everyone provided you contribute as well. If you're only going to spectate, it won't make sense since you wont have any coins to use for yourself.

Two months ago, I was spending 60+ hours a month just copying invoice data into spreadsheets. Invoice number, date, vendor name, amounts... over and over again.

My eyes were dying. My back hurt. And I kept making stupid mistakes that took even MORE time to fix.

**The moment I snapped:**

I entered the same invoice twice in one day. Then spent 3 hours finding and fixing it in our books. That's when I decided enough was enough.

**What I tried first (that didn't work):**

* Zapier: Too expensive for high volume, kept hitting limits
* Fancy OCR software: $199/month and still needed manual cleanup
* Virtual assistant: Cheaper but errors were worse than mine

**So I built something custom:**

Used n8n (it's free and open source) + an OCR API. Took me about 6 weeks of evenings and weekends, lots of YouTube tutorials, and way too much coffee.

Now it just... works.

Email comes in with invoice PDF → automation extracts the key data → dumps it into Google Sheets.

**What it grabs:**

* Invoice number
* Date
* Vendor name
* Customer name
* Amount
* Shipping address

**Real results after 8 weeks:**

* I'm down from 60 hours/month to maybe 8 hours (just reviewing exceptions)
* Haven't had a duplicate entry since
* My API costs are around $45/month for \~2500 invoices

**Things that surprised me:**

The hard part wasn't the OCR. It was handling all the weird edge cases. Invoices come in a million different formats.

I had to build in a lot of ""if this fails, try that"" logic.

**What it still can't do:**

Line items. If you need every single product line extracted, this won't work. I only needed header-level summary data for my books, so it's perfect for me.

**Honestly?**

I'm shocked I didn't do this sooner. Yeah, it took 6 weeks to build. But I've already saved like 200+ hours of my life.

If anyone's drowning in invoice data entry and wants to chat about the technical side, I'm happy to share what I learned. Took a lot of trial and error to get right.

Anyone else automate something boring recently? Would love to hear what you built.

**Minutes of the Board meeting of Oberhauser Gastlichkeit GmbH aboard the new geosync orbit hotel The Zenith Crown. c.205X**

The brand new Pod, a sleek white-and-gold projectile bearing the insignias of the 'Seven Sisters' of the new economy, detached from the Tether's main hub. Using micro-thrusters with surgical precision, it glided toward the docking spire of the Zenith Crown. As it crossed the proximity threshold, the hotel's magnetic tractor fields engaged, locking the luxury transit-module into the primary airlock.

The seven passengers who stepped onto the gantry were the new masters of the solar system—the CEOs and Chief Strategists of the supercorporations that had emerged from the ruins of the 20th-century industrial complex. Wearing fabrics woven from carbon-nanotubes and starlight-grade silk, they moved with the unhurried confidence of those who had privatized the high ground. A phalanx of hotel staff, trained in zero-g hospitality, guided them through the airlock and into the express lift.

Immediately, the lift descended into the great rotating ring of the station. As the centrifugal force ramped up to a comfortable 0.2g, the sense of weightlessness transitioned into a borough, god-like lightness—the exact physical sensation of floating above the masses.

They gathered in the Grand Chancellor conference suite. The room was a masterpiece of transparent aluminum, offering a panoramic voice of the Earth below, which looked like a fragile, glowing marble. The station’s rotation was perfectly timed to the terminator line, ensuring the room was bathed in a perpetual, golden twilight that masked the terrifying reality of the void outside.

Dr. Klaus von Oberhauser, President and CEO of Oberhauser Gastlichkeit GmbH, officially opened the proceedings. ""Distinguished board members and strategic partners, I thank you for joining us for the formal commissioning of The Zenith Crown,"" he stated, met by polite applause. ""I am pleased to report that the S.L.A.M. Corporation has demonstrated exemplary compliance with all contractual obligations; their non-interference in our operational framework and personnel management remains absolute.

The fact that military investment has plummeted to zero has removed the governments as our biggest competitors. Their failure to oppose the new order has opened the world to us. Nobody has now the power to compete against the new mega-corporations, and our profits have exploded. (huge applauds)

As observed during our ascent, our proprietary luxury transit pods are fully integrated with the Tether’s electromagnetic rail. While the public continues to use the standardized high-capacity transit, our mandate remains focused on delivering the bespoke, premium-tier experience our discerning clientele expects—and for which they are prepared to pay a substantial premium."" (Restrained laughter echoed around the table).

""You will have ample opportunity to experience—and enjoy—the unparalleled amenities of this station during the following cycles. But for now, it is my distinct honor to introduce the Chairman of **Formosa Oceanic Holdings**, Mr. Lin-Wei Chen, the Taipei-based titan which has recently finalized the acquisition and total absorption of both **Carnival Corporation** and the **Royal Caribbean Group**. This strategic consolidation follows the period of... regrettable logistical paralysis... the United States was forced to endure during the previous years."" (Sustained, louder applause).

Lin-Wei Chen: ""Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and all of you, my dearest friends. Today, I will introduce our new project, the **Grand Serenity**, which is in its final phase in our partner space shipyard, **Van der Meer Aerospace**."" (He offered a subtle, knowing smile toward the elegant lady on the side, Dr. Saskia van der Meer).

""The Grand Serenity is not merely a vessel; it is the first of its kind—a luxury solar-sail cruiser designed to traverse the silence between Earth and the moon in absolute comfort. By utilizing the new high-tensile filaments provided by S.L.A.M. and the exquisite craftsmanship of our Dutch partners, we are moving away from the era of 'transit' and into the era of 'voyage.' Our clients do not wish to merely arrive; they wish to inhabit the stars.""

""You are all well aware that our initial venture—a high-density transit corridor between Earth and the Lunar settlements—was brutally undercut. The S.L.A.M. introduction of the 'Magnetoplasmadynamic Drive' reduced transit times to a mere three hours. It was a logistical decapitation; they ignored every tentative reach for licensing or joint venture. In that sector, competition is an impossibility. But the luxury market is different. Reid is a man of few words, and while those words are law, he seems content to leave the aesthetics of the void to us... provided we pay our berth fees on time."" (A heavy, collective sigh moved around the table).

Dr. Klaus von Oberhauser turned his gaze toward a woman sitting with military posture at the far end of the table. ""While we look to the sails of the future, we must also anchor our terrestrial desires. Ms. Sarah Sterling, representing our North American development consortium, will now provide us with an update on the 'Tranquility Base' project. This is to be the premiere hotel and entertainment complex on the Lunar surface—specifically situated in the Sea of Serenity, within respectful, yet highly lucrative, proximity to the original Apollo 11 landing site.""

Sarah Sterling inclined her head, her expression unreadable. ""The foundation is set, Dr. von Oberhauser. We are carving a sanctuary from the basalt. It is no longer a monument to a dead flag; it is a playground for the living elite.""

""We would have preferred to maintain total autonomy over our construction logistics,"" Sarah continued, her voice gaining a rare, vibrant edge of excitement. ""However, as Chairman Chen noted, the sheer efficiency of the S.L.A.M. orbital freight system made any other path an exercise in vanity. Their machines worked with a cold, terrifying perfection. Our crews, our refined materials, and our specialized life-support modules were delivered with surgical precision—on time, under budget, and with a professional detachment that is, frankly, invigorating. The speed of progress is staggering. Gentlemen, if this construction speed holds, our next board meeting will not be held in geosync orbit. We will be drinking this vintage while looking back at Earth from the surface of the Moon!"" (very loud applause).

Dr. von Oberhauser signaled toward the man seated to his left, whose fingers were absentmindedly tracing patterns on the surface of a sleek, translucent slate. ""And as we establish our presence on the surface, we must recognize the engines that power our interfaces. Mr. Akira Sato, CEO of **Neo-Kyoto Systems**, will speak to the initial output of the high-orbit foundries.""

Akira Sato adjusted his cuff, the fabric of his suit shimmering with an embedded circuitry pattern. ""The transition to the **Nexus-1** orbital factory has exceeded even our most aggressive internal projections,"" he began, his voice calm but vibrating with an unmistakable pride. ""In the absolute vacuum and zero-gravity of the high-orbit sector, we have achieved semiconductor purity levels previously thought to be theoretical. Our defect rate has effectively vanished. We are no longer manufacturing components; we are growing them in a state of crystalline perfection. This leap in quality has allowed us to capture 92% of the high-end quantum-processing market in a single fiscal quarter. Consequently, Neo-Kyoto's margins have widened by 40%, a testament to the fact that the void is not merely a frontier, but the ultimate clean-room."" (Nods of approval from the board).

""The pursuit of perfection is not limited to silicon,"" interjected Dr. Elena Varga, CEO of **Varga-Nordic Biopharma**, her voice possessing a sharp, clinical edge. ""The 'Aether-Lab' modules on the **Heisenberg Orbital Complex** have catalyzed a revolution in molecular synthesis. In the absence of gravitational sedimentation, we are harvesting protein crystals of unparalleled symmetry. We have successfully bioprinted complex vascular structures—hearts and kidneys that do not collapse under their own weight during the curing process. This 'orbital-grade' purity has allowed us to launch our Longevity-9 series. Demand from the terrestrial elite has reached a fever pitch; our pre-order margins are currently sitting at a record 55% per unit. We are no longer treating disease; we are refining human biology in a way that the ground simply would not allow.""

An older gentleman rose, his posture as rigid and precise as a balance sheet. He carried the unmistakable aura of a senior accountant, speaking in a monocord voice that lacked any perceptible emotional frequency. As the Chief Financial Officer for the consortium’s global endeavors, Mr. Kwesi Okonjo was the embodiment of fiscal caution, a man who viewed the world through the lens of risk assessment and long-term stability.

""As the fiduciary observer of our international interests,"" Mr. Okonjo began, his tone a steady, unvarying drone, ""I seek the Board’s collective appraisal on a development of recent note. While our internal projections suggest a neutral impact on immediate operational margins or share price volatility, the strategic shift is profound. I refer to the S.L.A.M. Corporation’s formal deployment of the new Void Space Credit, VSC in short.""

Dr. Klaus von Oberhauser leaned in, the golden twilight of the cabin catching the edges of his spectacles. ""Please, Mr. Okonjo. We have observed the ripples of the S.L.A.M. announcement. We are awaiting your expertise to determine if this is a mere accounting convenience or the final decommissioning of the old financial world.""

""Thank you, Doctor. As the Board is aware, precisely one quarter ago, S.L.A.M. inaugurated a new sovereign medium of exchange to—and I quote—‘standardize extraterrestrial commerce and mitigate the systemic fracturing of the global monetary apparatus.’ In reality, this was the final nail in the coffin of American fiscal hegemony; the dollar’s status as a reserve asset was dismantled in a single week. The ‘spontaneous’ adoption of the VSC by the Eurozone, China, and India has set a precedent that a multitude of emerging markets are now following, adopting the Credit as their primary national tender. It is a purely digital architecture, absolute in its security and accessible via the most rudimentary consumer hardware—a prerequisite for those nations seeking to qualify for S.L.A.M. developmental grants and liquidity loans. Consequently, I formally propose that this consortium ratifies the immediate adoption of the Void Space Credit as our primary unit of account, and that we leverage our market position to mandate this transition across our entire network of strategic partners.""

Dr. Klaus von Oberhauser scanned the room, his eyes lingering for a fraction of a second on each titan of industry. ""The motion is on the floor,"" he announced, his voice carrying the weight of the new world order. ""All those in opposition?""

The silence was absolute; not a single hand stirred.

""Abstentions?""

Again, the stillness of the room remained unbroken.

""The motion is carried unanimously,"" Oberhauser declared. ""Mr. Okonjo, you are authorized to initiate all necessary protocols for an immediate and seamless transition to the Void Space Credit across our entire infrastructure.""

He stood, the subtle click of his joints masked by the soft hum of the station’s environmental systems. ""And now, for the most essential item on today’s agenda: the inaugural lunch. If you would please follow me to the Grand Dining Hall.""

The room erupted in polite laughter and vigorous applause as the Masters of the Seven Sisters rose from their seats, their silk garments shimmering in the artificial twilight. One by one, they followed Oberhauser out of the suite, their hushed conversations already turning to the logistics of the lunar playground.

Mr. Kwesi Okonjo did not follow. He remained at the table, a solitary figure of rigid precision amidst the empty chairs. He waited until the heavy doors hissed shut, sealing him in the silence of the Grand Chancellor suite. Slowly, he reached for his glass of water. He did not drink. Instead, he raised the glass in a precise, measured salute toward the security sensor nestled in the ceiling.

""Long live the Empire,"" he whispered, his monocord voice finally betraying a hint of something resembling devotion. ""Long live the Emperor.""

High above, the small red light on the camera housing pulsed three times in silent, rhythmic acknowledgment.

**From the salvaged notes of Vann, P.I. c. 205X**

Vann sat in the back of a nondescript delivery van, the interior cramped and smelling of stale coffee and hot electronics. Outside, the tropical rain of Singapore hammered against the roof in a steady, deafening rhythm. He adjusted the gain on his monitor, watching the main exit of the S.L.A.M. Space Station—the massive, high-security terminal adjacent to Changi that served as the heartbeat of the orbital elevator.

""Target is moving,"" Vann wrote in his notebook, with date and time.

A black, armored sedan pulled away from the private gantry, followed by two dark SUVs filled with Peacekeepers—human beings in crisp, charcoal S.L.A.M. uniforms, their faces visible and disciplined. They didn't need active-camouflage to be intimidating; the SLAM patch on their shoulders did the work for them.

Vann pulled out into the late-afternoon traffic, keeping three cars back.

The tail was long and careful. They left the neon glow of the airport district, heading toward the lush, older wealth of Bukit Timah. This was the territory of the old money, the place where the Azure Dragon triad had once ruled from behind high walls.

They reached the gates of the Empress’s Garden.

Vann remembered the stories of how Reid had taken this place from the mob in a single night. The high stone walls were the same, but the barbed wire had been replaced by elegant, recessed sensors and climbing jasmine. It was no longer a fortress for criminals; it was a sanctuary.

Vann hopped out of the van two blocks early, moving through the shadows of the rain-slicked trees. He climbed the ridge overlooking the estate, settling into a position where he could see over the perimeter. He pulled a high-powered optical rig from his bag—real glass, real sensors. No drones.

He zoomed in on the main courtyard.

Clarissa Tang stepped out of the sedan. The Peacekeepers fanned out with practiced efficiency, securing the perimeter of the house that had once been a den of murder. She looked composed, her white suit a sharp contrast against the dark, wet stone of the driveway.

Vann adjusted his parabolic mic, aiming it at the heavy oak doors. He just needed a name, a fragment of conversation—anything Lao Feng could use as a lever.

Vann watched as the heavy doors of the main residence opened. He expected a servant, or perhaps a final security sweep. Instead, two small streaks of color—twins, a boy and a girl no more than three years old—erupted from the house. Their high, joyful shouts carried faintly through the mic.

Clarissa didn't just greet them; she dropped her bag and knelt on the wet stone, catching them both in a fierce, enthusiastic embrace.

Vann’s mind raced, frantically flipping through every decrypted file and Triad rumor he had ever memorized. *Children.* There was nothing in the Iron Fang dossiers about heirs. No birth certificates in the Singapore registries, no sightings at the SLAM medical centers. In the eyes of the world, Clarissa Tang was the ""White Widow,"" a solitary figure bound to a husband who lived thirty-six thousand kilometers above the dirt.

Then a man stepped out from the warm amber light of the foyer. He wasn't Georges Reid. He was younger, Asian, dressed in a simple linen shirt. He walked toward Clarissa with a familiar, easy grace, reaching down to help her up before kissing her with a quiet, domestic intimacy.

Vann felt a chill that had nothing to do with the Singapore rain. He wasn't looking at a simple affair; he was looking at the ultimate logistical redirection. The ""Empire"" was a shield. The marriage to the God-Emperor was a front, a hollow shell designed to protect this—a real life, a real family, hidden in the very heart of the storm.

Vann pulled back from the rig, his hands trembling. He realized with a terrifying clarity that he hadn't found leverage for Lao Feng. He had found a secret so dangerous that the mere act of witnessing it had effectively marked him for erasure.

His fingers worked the shutter with a clinical, frantic rhythm, capturing the frames that would burn the world down: the man’s profile, the children’s laughter, the Empress’s unguarded smile. He didn't upload to the cloud—S.L.A.M. owned the sky, and anything transmitted would be intercepted before it reached the first relay. Instead, he pulled the physical encrypted cards, tucking into a lead-lined pouch sewn into his belt.

He didn't return to the van. The van was a beacon, a fixed point in a city governed by predictive algorithms. He ghosted down the back of the ridge, abandoning the heavy rig in a drainage culvert and sliding into the humid, evening shadows of Bukit Timah Road.

Vann didn't hail an auto-cab. He walked until his lungs burned, merging into the anonymity of a crowded bus stop. He caught the 170, the rhythmic hiss of the air-brakes sounding like a countdown. He watched the reflections in the window, scanning every face, every black sedan that lingered a second too long in the neighboring lane.

At Little India, he hopped off before the doors fully closed, cutting through the spice-scented maze of the Tekka Centre to catch a cross-town line heading toward Geylang. He switched three times—bus to MRT, MRT to a different bus—utilizing the chaotic density of the evening rush to bleach his trail. Every time he stepped onto a new platform, he felt the weight of the data against his hip, a radioactive secret that made the neon lights of the city feel like a thousand searching eyes.

By the time he reached the outskirts of his cheap hotel, his shirt was plastered to his back with cold sweat. He didn't use the elevator. He took the service stairs, his hand never leaving the knife at his waist.

At the fourth-floor landing, he paused, back flat against the concrete wall, listening to the hum of the vending machine and the distant mumble of a television. He moved to Room 412. He didn't reach for the handle. He knelt, his eyes inches from the doorframe. The single, grey hair he had wedged into the hinge was still there—undisturbed, a microscopic line of defense.

Inside, he stayed in the shadows, letting the door click shut with a soft, mechanical finality. He didn't reach for the light. Instead, he pulled a small, air-gapped tablet from a hollowed-out floorboard. He reviewed the loop from the pinhole camera he’d hidden in the fire extinguisher across the hall. He scrolled through hours of grainy, low-light footage: a cleaning droid, a couple of tourists, the flickering fluorescent light. No intruders. No ""polite men in suits"" with Phoenix pins.

The paranoia was a physical weight, a constant tension in his jaw. To go against S.L.A.M. was to go against a God that monitored the very pulse of the planet. Every digital footprint was a breadcrumb; every wireless signal was a flare.

He sat at the small, scarred wooden desk. He ignored his laptop. Instead, he pulled a heavy, leather-bound notebook and a fountain pen from his pack. Analog. Old world. No metadata, no IP logs, no ghost in the machine to betray him. The scratching of the nib was the only sound in the room as he began to transcribe the impossible.

*Subject: The Empress’s Garden. Findings: The ""White Widow"" is a logistical fabrication. Heirs confirmed. Secondary subject identified: Non-Imperial male, Asian, domestic partner. The Emperor's official life is a diversion—a global-scale protection detail.*

He stared at the ink as it dried, black and permanent. He was holding the match that could ignite a war, and in the silence of the room, he realized that for the first time in his career, he was truly afraid of the dark.

Vann knew the digital archives were a minefield. S.L.A.M. didn't just delete history; they rewrote it in real-time. If he wanted the truth, he needed the fragments they'd missed—the physical leftovers and the un-scrubbed memories of a city that had been bought and sold a dozen times over.

He left the hotel before dawn, heading for the National Library’s basement—not the sleek, digitized upper floors, but the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library. He spent six hours in the dust-choked microfilm stacks, his eyes burning from the flicker of the old projectors. He was looking for the night of the ""Azure Dragon"" collapse, the moment the power shifted from the street to the Spire.

He found it in a scanned copy of an old Mount Elizabeth Hospital psychiatric ward intake form, buried in a defunct medical database. A witness statement: Maria Santos. A domestic helper who had seen the world break inside the Bukit Timah house.

*“The young masters... they leave us... Jian, betrayer ?”*

The words were a hammer blow. Vann cross-referenced the name ""Jian"" with old syndicate personnel files he’d been given. He found a match in a high-res photo of a Azure Dragon low-level enforcer who had vanished the same week Georges Reid married Clarissa Tang. The facial architecture was a ninety-eight percent match for the man he’d seen through the rig at the Garden.

He dug deeper, shifting to the ""Shadow Ledger"" audit reports from the early 204X period. He found the redacted Clause 14-B of the SPBG loan. The default condition: the transfer of Clarissa Tang to the Azure Dragon as ""collateral.""

Vann sat back, the cool air of the library basement feeling like ice on his skin. He understood the math now. The God-Emperor hadn't just saved the bank; he had purchased the freedom of the woman he loved—or perhaps the woman he respected enough to give everything back to. He had liquidated a triad, erased a debt, and provided a global-scale alibi so Clarissa could live in the shadows with her real partner, while he became the ""Silence in the Heavens.""

The twins weren't just heirs; they were the biological proof of a massive, multi-billion credit deception. Every piece of S.L.A.M. propaganda, every ""White Widow"" mourning gown, every speech about the ""divine isolation"" of the Emperor was a security layer for a family that officially didn't exist.

Vann closed the notebook. He had the proof. He had the names. He had the man. But as he looked at the exit, he realized that this information didn't make him a kingmaker for Lao Feng. It made him a loose thread in a tapestry woven by a mind that could calculate the flight path of a B-21 or the collapse of a carrier fleet while eating a pastry.

He wasn't an investigator anymore. He was a witness to a god's personal secret, and in Singapore, the penalty for that was rarely a trial. It was simply the lack of memory of you after being deleted.

He had forgotten the clerk. The man in the library basement was a ghost of a different kind—a paper-pusher whose only loyalty was to the system's log-in screen. After Vann stepped into the oppressive humidity of the street, the clerk’s fingers danced across a keyboard, logging the request into a centralized security index as he had done every day for twenty years. *Subject: Azure Dragon. Case File: OP-DRAGON-FALL.* In a city where the S.L.A.M. grid parsed every byte of data, Vann’s analog curiosity had just left a digital scar.

Back in Room 412, the air was stale. Vann moved with a mechanical, frantic rhythm. Check the hair. Check the loop. Scan for the hidden pulse of a sleeper bug. He sat at the desk, hardening the report with the final, damning details—Jian, the dates, the connection to the Celestial Way. Every word felt like a death warrant.

He didn't sleep. He sat in the dark, watching the red eye of the fire alarm, listening for the sound of an elevator that didn't stop at the fourth floor. At 04:00, he opened a burner browser and booked a one-way flight to Shanghai using a dead man’s credit line. He had to be off the island before the cleaners realized the leak wasn't just digital. He was a loose variable in an empire that didn't tolerate math errors.

Changi Airport was a sprawling cathedral of glass and steel, every biometric sensor and automated gate feeling like a cold, electronic snare. Vann moved through the terminal with the blank, invisible stare of a man who didn't exist, his heart a rhythmic hammer against his ribs. He didn't relax when he cleared the final security gate. He didn't relax as he scanned the crowd for the tell-tale stillness of a tail.

He only felt the first, thin tremor of relief when he stepped into the jet bridge for the 06:15 to Shanghai. The climate-controlled tunnel was a vacuum, a physical transition zone between the city that wanted him erased and the aircraft that would carry him into the chaos of the mainland.

A young woman walked a few paces ahead of him—beautiful, elegantly dressed in a light trench coat, her blonde hair catching the overhead fluorescents. She moved with a slight, graceful hurry. Ten feet from the aircraft door, she stumbled. Her leather shoulder bag slipped, hitting the carpeted floor and spilling a chaotic collection of travel documents and personal items.

It was the vestigial reflex of a life lived before the Empire—a final, fatal lapse into chivalry. Vann stepped forward, bending down gallantly to retrieve a fallen passport.

The woman didn't thank him. She didn't even turn around.

As Vann reached for the document, he felt it—a sharp, clinical sting at the base of his skull, just beneath the hairline. It was the precise, cold puncture of a pressurized injector.

His vision didn't blur; it simply extinguished. The last thing he felt wasn't the carpet or the bag, but the sudden, heavy silence of the void. In the heart of the empire, the variable had finally been reconciled.

A few nights later, in the sprawling, gilded estate of the Lao family in Shanghai, the silence of the pre-dawn hours was broken by a thin, rhythmic sound.

It was the crying of a newborn. A soft, wet whimpering that drifted through the heavy silk curtains of the nursery.

The daughter of Lao Feng stirred in her sleep, the maternal instinct cutting through the fog of exhaustion. She rose, her silk nightgown whispering against the mahogany floorboards, and moved toward the crib. The air in the room felt unnaturally cold, heavy with a metallic, copper scent that made the back of her throat itch.

""Hush now,"" she whispered, her voice thick with sleep. ""Mama is here.""

She reached into the crib, her hand searching for the warmth of her child beneath the hand-embroidered covers. Her fingers touched something cold. Something hard. It wasn't the soft yielding of a baby’s cheek, but the rigid, waxy texture of frozen skin.

The crying stopped instantly, as if a switch had been flipped.

With a sudden, sickening jolt of adrenaline, she threw back the coverlet.

She didn't scream. Not at first. The horror was too total for sound.

Staring up from the center of the white silk mattress was a human head. The skin had been drained to the color of bone, the lips pulled back in a final, silent snarl of terror. The eyes were wide, pinned open with surgical precision, the glassy pupils fixed on the ceiling.

Beneath the severed neck, the crib was a lake of thick, congealing darkness. The baby's white lace gown was saturated, the fabric heavy and sodden with blood that had been poured into the small space like a ritual offering. The infant lay silent, its small body partially obscured by the weight of the man's head, its face smeared with the same dark, iron-scented ruin.

Then the shriek came—a jagged, animal sound that tore through the Lao estate, shattering the silence of the Shanghai night.



**The Underworld: Night in the Pearl of the Orient**

The air in The Gilded Paradox was thick enough to chew—a toxic cocktail of high-end cigar smoke, expensive French cognac, and the lingering scent of sex. Deep in the bowels of the Shanghai Bund, far beneath the soaring maglev tracks and the glowing holos of the S.L.A.M. energy grid, the old world was still breathing, heavy and ragged.

In the VIP sanctum, the walls were lined with silk the color of dried blood. Three men sat in a semicircle of leather armchairs, their faces half-shrouded in the dim, amber glow of a single recessed lantern.

To the left sat Lao Feng, the ""Great Ghost"" of the Iron Fang Triad. He was a man made of scars and expensive linen, representing the mainland's unrefined muscle. Opposite him was Hsieh ""The Serpent"" Kai, a slim, tailored figure from Taipei’s Celestial Way Syndicate, his fingers idly tracing the rim of a crystal glass. Between them sat Oyabun Kenjiro Sato, a man who carried the weight of the Kuro-ryu Clan like a burial shroud, his eyes like polished obsidian.

Lao Feng didn't look at his guests. He looked at the three girls kneeling by the low teak table, their bodies painted in shimmering gold leaf, pouring tea with trembling hands. With a single, sharp flick of his wrist—a gesture that had sent men to their deaths for thirty years—he signaled the room.

The girls retreated instantly, disappearing through the heavy velvet curtains. The personal servant, a man who looked like he’d been built from granite, bowed once and pulled the heavy soundproof doors shut. The silence that followed was heavy, punctuated only by the distant, rhythmic thrum of the city's heartbeat.

Lao Feng leaned forward, the shadows dancing in the hollows of his cheeks. ""The billionaires in the sky are celebrating their new credits,"" he rasped, his voice sounding like sandpaper on stone. ""They think they’ve privatized the stars. But they’ve forgotten one thing.""

Oyabun Sato reached into his kimono, producing a small, obsidian-black datapad. ""They have forgotten that every empire has a gutter,"" he whispered. ""And we are the ones who own the gutter.""

Sato leaned into the light, a cold, predatory gleam in his eyes. ""The Kuro-ryu are ready for the first harvest. The pipes are primed. Our associates at Varga-Nordic—those ice-cold professionals at V.N.B.—did exactly what they were paid for. They tucked a ghost-lab right into the guts of the Heisenberg plan. We’re going to be cooking our own brand of 'medicine' within thirty days. Out there in the void, where gravity doesn't exist to mess with the molecules, the purity is so high it’ll make your soul ache. It’s through the roof.""

He took a slow, deliberate sip of his tea. ""And the best part? The transit. Every container heading back to the mud is going to be handled transparently—ghosts in the machine. Thanks to Reid’s big shiny elevator, the price per container is a rounding error on a dead man’s tab. We aren't just selling a product anymore; we're selling the only thing the Emperor can't tax.""

Hsieh Kai smiled, a thin, predatory expression. ""The Emperor built a shining ladder to the stars. He forgot that the brighter he burns, the deeper the shadows grow—and the shadows are our home.""

Hsieh swirled the amber liquid in his glass, watching the light fracture against the crystal. ""Singapore is a dead-end,"" he said, his voice as thin and sharp as a switchblade. ""Out of the Lion City, we can’t touch those automated S.L.A.M. freighters. A pity, too—they’re fast as a bullet and twice as quiet. We tried testing the waters with three dummy shipments. They didn't just go missing; they were deleted. No physical trace, and the S.L.A.M. central server says they never existed in the first place. It’s like trying to smuggle past a god—he doesn’t just take your cargo; he takes the memory of it.""

He leaned in, the shadows pooling in his eyes. ""The last bagman we sent to find the leak? They found him in a Geylang dive, drugged into tomorrow and tangled up with an underage ghost who evaporated the second the door was kicked in. He’s awaiting a date with a firing squad for a crime that was never on paper. So, we do it the hard way. The long walk. New maglev to Thailand, slow-boat to Canada, then a crawl across the border into the States. It’s slow, it’s expensive, and it's ugly. HE seems aware, but do not give a shit.""

Lao Feng grunted, a sound like gravel turning in a cement mixer. ""After Hsieh’s little ghost story, we thought we’d get cute. We went looking for a handle on Clarissa Tang. We reached out to that *lǎo bù sǐ*—the old bastard running the Azure Dragon in Hong Kong. You know what he gave us? A laugh that sounded like a death rattle and a dial tone. That was the end of the conversation.""

He paused, his eyes narrowing into slits. ""I sent a professional. A P.I. with a clean record and a dirty mind. He dug. He found something, alright. But he didn’t make the hand-off. My daughter found his head tucked under the covers in my grandson’s bedroom, staring at the ceiling with wide, dead eyes. That was the message. Loud and clear.""

He leaned back, the leather of his chair creaking like a hanging rope. ""From now on, we don’t walk near the Reid family. We don’t even look at their shadow. As Hsieh said, the Emperor knows we’re here, and he doesn’t care as long as we stay in the mud. But I’ll tell you this—I’m waiting for the day a polite little man in a suit with a Phoenix pin on his lapel comes knocking, asking for a 'contribution.'""

The air in the room got ten degrees colder. All three men felt the horror of potential extortion, something they had all some experience in.

The tension didn't break; it just curdled into a different kind of hunger. At a grunt from Lao Feng, the soundproof doors hissed open and the night truly began. Platters of raw, marbled beef and crystal bowls of synthetic stimulants appeared as if summoned from the ether. The gold-leafed girls returned, moving with the silent, practiced grace of clockwork dolls.

For the next two hours, the ""Gilded Paradox"" lived up to its name. The three masters of the gutter indulged in the spoils of their shadowy domain—expensive cognac flowed like water, and the air turned blue with the smoke of cigars that cost more than a common laborer made in a year. They took what and who they wanted, when they wanted, a desperate display of power in a world where they were increasingly becoming relics.

Finally, as the first grey light of a Shanghai dawn began to bleed through the Bund, the men filtered out. Lao Feng left with his Granite-built shadow; Sato and Kai vanished into the neon rain of the street, their security details materializing from the alleys like ghosts.

The room was left in a state of expensive ruin—tipped glasses, scattered ash, and the lingering scent of spent adrenaline. A team of faceless cleaners moved in, their movements efficient and robotic. They scrubbed the silk, polished the teak, and erased the physical memory of the night’s debauchery in under twenty minutes.

One of the gold-painted girls remained after the others had vanished. She checked the seal on the heavy doors, then walked to a far corner of the room where the wall seemed empty. There, partially hidden by the shifting ambers of the recessed lanterns, was a delicate, ink-wash painting of a dragon coiling through storm clouds.

The girl lowered her head, her posture shifting from that of a servant to one of profound, religious devotion. She bowed deeply toward the dragon.

“Long live the Empire. Long live the Emperor,” she whispered into the silence.

High above the clouds, the small red eye of the dragon in the painting pulsed three times in rhythmic, silent acknowledgment.

*""With the ability to go up to a best-in-class 810 kilometres on a single charge in an all-wheel drive configuration, beating even its most recently revealed competitors, the EX60 doesn’t just go further than any electric car that Volvo Cars has ever created.*

*It turns range anxiety into range comfort, demonstrating that going electric is no longer a compromise. Volvo Cars engineers have optimised the car’s range for real-life driving and what customers experience in their daily drive.* 

*""The EX60 is designed to be a gamechanger,"" says Anders Bell, Chief Technology Officer at Volvo Cars. ""With our new electric vehicle architecture, we directly address the main worries that customers have when considering a switch to a fully electric car. The result is class-leading range and fast charging speeds, marking the end of range anxiety.""*

*The EX60 does not only boast the longest range of any fully electric Volvo, it also charges faster than any electric Volvo before in all weather conditions. Instead of a full lunch break, a quick coffee stop is now enough to recharge the battery and hit the road again.* 

*Practically speaking, this means the EX60 can add up to 340km of range in just ten minutes when using a 400kW fast charger, making a charging stop nearly as fast as a fuel stop. And all EX60 customers can get a 10-year warranty on the battery.""*",73,1767862363.0,electricvehicles,67,0.89,False

I have an old Krups machine that's had at least two owners before me. This might be my problem. Still, it works fine with ground coffee. I recently bought e.s.e pods, since it has the basket for them, and it doesn't seem to have enough power to push through them? Just starts to sound clogged/suffocated and very little coffee comes out. 

 I've poked some holes in the pods to help water flow and that way I've gotten my cup of coffee but obviously that's not optimal, it's very inaccurate and sometimes makes it flow way too fast (and other times doesn't help at all). Does anyone have experience with this and is there a way to make the pods work better with my current machine? 

I know a better machine would be, well, better. But for now I'm focusing on making do with what I have.
I also know pods aren't the way to get the best coffee, I wfh and need a fast cup on my breaks. I like the full ground coffee process on weekends when I have the time. ",1,1767862176.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I got up in my warm house, switched on the light, started my coffee, took my shower, and prepared for my daily routine to get to work.  We are all aware of the challenges the snow brings us, but for me, it's just another normal day with a little longer commute to work.  For some, the challenges bring more than just a little inconvenience, but a major headache.  Today, like the past couple of days, we all mostly lived a normal life.  The house was warm, the water is running, we had our tea and coffee, and we were still able to get the necessities of life.  So rather than complain about the inconveniences (I know, were all channeling our inner Dutch), I want to celebrate.

Today, and the past couple of days, we have been blessed with the magical transformation of an entire country into a beautiful winter wonderland!  For those of us with families, we celebrate by sledding down the local hill. We capture those amazing pictures and memories we will all look back on and laugh about in the years to come.  More than that, I want to take the extra time to celebrate something more important.  

The past couple of days, I have witnessed the people that wake up each and every day to clean their doorstep, driveways, and sidewalks.  For some, though, it goes even further.  Quietly, with persistence and determination, a few of you march on to bear the freezing wind and blowing snow.  Not to look after your things, but to also look out for your fellow neighbor and community member.  To see the community come together to ensure those that cannot do this for themselves also have a safe place to travel is uplifting.  On the other side, we have some amazing people out there doing a job that often gets criticized, undervalued, and forgotten.  These are the men and women that make sure the water runs, the electricity flows, the roads and train lines get cleared so the rest of us can live a normal, though somewhat inconvenienced, life.  These are the people that quietly get excited for a challenge like this.  The ones that stand up in the face of disaster and say, ""I got this.  Hold my beer!""  These are the real warriors and heroes.

The Owens Valley Radio Observatory was usually a place of quiet humming and late-night coffee. That changed at 3:14 AM when Dr. Aris Thorne noticed a spike in the sub-millimeter band. It wasn't the rhythmic pulse of a pulsar or the messy roar of a supernova. It was a sequence: prime numbers, followed by a complex mathematical harmonic that mirrored the structure of human DNA.

""It’s not noise,"" Aris whispered, his eyes reflected in the glowing monitor. ""It’s a greeting.""
For six months, a global team of linguists and physicists worked in secret. They dubbed the signal ""The Invitation."" It seemed to contain a blueprint for a high-bandwidth narrow-beam transmission. To the scientists, it felt like a handshake across the dark. Despite warnings from sociologists about the ""Dark Forest"" theory, the urge to be heard won out.

Using the massive dish at Arecibo's successor, they fired a concentrated burst back at the coordinates. It contained the history of Earth, our music, and a simple message: We are here. We are peaceful. Come meet us.

Chapter 2: The Red Harvest

The reply reached the Mothership Xylos in the void beyond Pluto. To the Xylosians, the message wasn't a greeting; it was a dinner bell. They were a nomadic, predatory caste that had spent centuries looking for ""soft"" planets—worlds with high biodiversity and unshielded atmospheres.
When the silver, needle-like ships pierced Earth’s exosphere three weeks later, the world cheered.

People gathered in the streets of New York, Tokyo, and London with signs of welcome. The cheering stopped when the first kinetic slugs hit.
The Xylosians didn't use lasers; they used gravity. They dropped massive tungsten rods from orbit, creating the impact force of nuclear bombs without the radiation. Coastal cities were swallowed by tsunamis, and the sky turned a bruised purple as the alien ""harvesters"" began stripping the atmosphere of nitrogen.

Aris watched the destruction from a bunker, the weight of a billion lives on his shoulders. He had sent the signal. He had opened the door to a wolf. By the end of the first week, humanity’s organized militaries were in ruins, and the ""Invitation"" had become a death warrant.

Chapter 3: The Interstellar Warrant

Just as the Xylos prepared to deploy its ground-borne spores to consume the remaining biomass, the sky turned a brilliant, antiseptic white.
Six monolithic ships, perfectly cubic and shimmering with blue light, dropped out of warp. They didn't target Earth; they boxed in the Xylosian fleet. A broadcast over-rode every electronic device on the planet—not in math, but in a clear, synthesized voice.
""CITIZENS OF THE XYLOS CASTE: YOU ARE UNDER ARREST FOR THE UNAUTHORIZED HARVESTING OF A PROTECTED PRE-WARP SPECIES. DROP YOUR SHIELDS OR FACE ATOMIZATION.""

These were the Sentinels, the peacekeepers of the Orion Arm. They moved with terrifying efficiency. Blue tractor beams locked onto the needle-ships, dragging them out of the atmosphere like a gardener pulling weeds. The Xylosian flagship tried to fire a gravity slug, but the Sentinel cubes simply absorbed the energy and returned it as an EMP that neutralized the entire pirate fleet.

Within hours, the invaders were hauled into the dark, towed away to a distant sector for judgment. One Sentinel ship remained behind for a moment, sending a final message to the battered ruins of the observatory.

""We apologize for the delay,"" the voice echoed. ""We heard your reply, but so did the poachers. You are now registered as a protected sanctuary. Please... be more careful about who you talk to.""",0,1767861858.0,writingcritiques,0,0.5,False

She would befriend my friends and ask them about me and there was a point where my sister came to visit and she hid behind my room to see what she brought me. I eventually got fed up and told my dad. He knew her family, called them and they told to a teacher who was their family friend. He called us both, he assumed I was the bully coz I came from a “broken home” my (parents were divorced). She was crying pretending like I was the bully. I eventually learned of somethings she was going through at the time and I gave her grace. We graduated, I moved to the city and she stayed in the town we grew up in. I don’t really know how but we became close but she would  come see me in the city. We will hang out during holidays and honestly just be girls. I didn’t hold anything against her because to me we were young and people grow. 

We had an interesting dynamic, she will call me for advice but isn’t really there when I need help. I remember I shared one day that I am depressed and she responded “depression doesn’t exist and every explanation I try to give , she would lash out. She will them come back few weeks later, like it didn’t happen. She would also imitate me from my interests, personality, and clothes. I remember saving up for a bike I really wanted and when I bought it and shared it with her. She didn’t congratulate me, she went to the bank for a loan and bought her own bike two days later. At the time I felt it’s okay for friends to inspire each other and I didn’t think much about it. 

I decided to go do a PHD in another country and I left her in our home country. After I moved, she again begun trying to find opportunities outside and she eventually got a visiting visa  and she went to a different country. We were still close, calling everyday and I believe we were bonding over being away from home. I graduated with my PHD , I was very excited and I remember her telling me she is taking a phone break the day of my graduation. I understood coz mental health issues don’t have great timing, I graduated no congratulations and no call, three days passed. I called genuinely just to check on her, she told me all the fun things she did those three days and I realized there was no social media/phone break, the break was just from me. I again gave her grace , I  got a really good job after graduation in the same country I did my PHD and I noticed she started asking  personal questions like how much do I earn? How much do I think my inheritance is going to be? 

In my culture, we don’t discuss people’s earnings so I told her that. To me we were still cool, until one day I told a colleague and I were  up for a promotion at work and things have been a little competitive. She got upset that she doesn’t like that I use the word competitive coz it sounds like I think people are jealous of me and she is not comfortable with a friend who uses jealousy lightly because one day, I will  call her jealous of me. I didn’t know where this was coming from and at first I tried to assuage her but the calls and texts started becoming berating “you think people are undeserving of you”, “I can’t trust someone who would one day think I am jealous of them” . Mind you, we are not in the same career line , not in the same country so I didn’t understand why my corporate competition had to do with her. So I got annoyed and I told her to leave me alone and that her feelings are her responsibility not mine. She stopped for two weeks, came back again still mean and still accusing future me. I again set a boundary and just stopped explaining myself. Through that year, she would call me not to apologize but once to ask if I am still at my job coz she saw rumors that the company I work for was getting bankrupt  and the second time to ask about my cousins divorce ( she heard some gossip and wanted to confirm) It was clear it wasn’t about me. When I would call, she was dismissive, like she just woke up and has nothing to say. September this year: we were all at home , so I called her and asked if she wanted to meet up for coffee. I wanted us to talk about things , she  said she did but when I was asking about specifics, she didn’t look interested . The following day she texted she would be at that coffee shop in 10 minutes, I apologized and told her I was in a nearest  town and since I didn’t hear from her I assumed we were off. I told her I don’t think I could make it. She said okay!! I moved on , spent time with my family. At the end of the day she called, saying she was at that coffee shop for 7 hours waiting for me. She called me immature and that I am the one who looked for her. I explained the confusion and asked her why she didn’t just let me know that she was there and she said “you looked for me, why should I call you to tell you anything” I apologized for any misunderstanding and while in the middle she hung up. I was exhausted by the relationship and honestly I was done. Moved back to my country of residence and felt ready to leave it all behind, this week she texted me and said we needed to catch up and I should call her. I didn’t want to so , I told her I am too busy and I don’t think I can. She then said she would like  to apologize not for the jealousy accusations, not for the recent coffee shop drama  but for apparently for saying she doesn’t want to be my friend anymore. Something this girl never said, I don’t want to revisit anything anymore so , I texted  apology accepted and stopped it there . 

This whole thing is confusing me, am I dumb for befriending my bully, was she ever my friend? I am annoyed at myself and I can’t stop trying to figure out what happened. Please help",1,1767861824.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

- traditional espresso & milk drinks (I like both)
- or really bad coffee (instant, awful moka pot, military field coffee, automated machines)

I had never tried good filter coffee before. I’ve been down the espresso rabbit hole for some time and never really bothered trying something new. I got influenced a lot by this sub and the rapid brewer “hype.” From what I read, I thought I would probably like this “tea-like experience"". I listened to a lot of recommendations from here and didn’t want to go cheap on the grinder (A4z) because I knew I would upgrade fast. I also never not had a hand grinder so I thought that's the opportunity.

And yeah… I was not ready for this.

I made a soup-style shot and diluted it a little. It’s my first cup. I just “dialed in” the grind size using a less expensive coffee based on the saturation speeds, as recommended.

The cup was:
- crazy sweet
- super tea-like, clean, and juicy

I didn’t know coffee could taste like this. It feels like a completely new world opened up to me. Now I’m really excited to explore everything in this category. I’ll definitely also try a “zuppa lunga” and get a V60 at some point.

Thanks to all of you!

TEA. this little girl. we call her M. same grade, same age. just short. gained a crush on him. and M had a goal. to get rid of my ass. so M falls for a boy every single month, she confess, he rejects, she moves on. so when she gained a crush i brushed it off since i know how she is. but she had GOALS. getting his number, texting late at night, asking for his sweater (in which he always rejected). while this went on for a month. and it was annoying me. we were never together but we had confess to each other but wanted to focus on college and health. even promising to workout together. healthy right? while i was drowning in college, my attention was on my future and i would come to school stressful, so he claimed “i forgot about him” but i didn’t! i still tried and hang out with him every day and i explain my worrits about college. Birthday party comes, he meets my parents, and M comes uninvited. they both disappear together. so i was furious. He started talking to her and claiming they were talking late, all because he wanted a reaction from me. and i warned him that M had a crush on him. well shit. he used that. he started to hang out with other girls at school and every time, he would look at me. so i asked him what the heck like friends are cool but like..this feels personal. while it was. he was trying to get me jealous. so we got into a fight and i ended the friendship. 5 months have passed, and some nights i still think about him. all the smiles and laughs. and the harsh things i said, and the harsh things he said. he given up on school and disappeared from classes, giving up on his future, even not wanting to submit college applications. (idk if he did or not). and my heart still hurts. he blocked me on every like an hour after the argument. and next day he was going around with girls and replaced my seat, my routine with him with M. but these nights he haunts me i go insane. cause was I in the wrong? should i go back and apoglize? i miss him a lot but, i also don’t. i started to heal and workout and work on myself. but he still haunts me….. anyways thanks for listening to my ted talk. loves <3",1,1767861072.0,Situationships,0,1.0,False

In Portugal, tipping is not expected. Service staff are paid a regular wage, and tips are not built into how hospitality work is compensated. Good service is considered the standard, not something that needs to be rewarded each time with extra money.

In cafés and bakeries, people generally do not tip at all, particularly when drinking coffee at the counter. In restaurants, locals may round up the bill or leave a small amount, around 5 percent, if the service was genuinely good. Leaving 10 percent is seen as generous, not normal.

Taxi and ride-hailing drivers do not expect tips either. Some people round up the fare or leave the change, many do not. The same applies to hotel staff and delivery drivers, where tipping is not routine.

Some locals are wary of tipping becoming more common, especially through visitor habits. When tipping spreads, expectations can shift, prices can rise, and what was once optional can start to feel mandatory.

I just want to share my experiences after leaving Starbucks and reflect back. I’m a former 226xxxx partner, stayed with the company for nearly 9 years before leaving. I stayed with Starbucks to finish my degree at ASU before leaving for a clerk position with the Judicial Branch. To be clear, I did not go to law school — this is just an entry level position within the court system.

My wife still works at Starbucks, so I still stay pretty informed with what’s going on in the company. 

Truth is, I do miss Starbucks most days but would absolutely never go back to that place. I felt completely and entirely trapped by Starbucks. The flexible scheduling, the food and drink benefits, the ability to request off any day you want as long as it’s far enough into the future, weekly income with tips — it’s all designed in a way that makes it really uncomfortable to leave the company, even if the pay is just alright.

My work schedule now consists of Monday through Friday, 8-5. The days are long, that’s for sure. But no 9 hour day at work even compares to the full 8 1/2 hour shift at Starbucks. I frequently tell my coworkers that there is no time to breathe at Starbucks. You clock in, work your ass off for your entire shift, and then you clock out. Just guns blazing all day long. 

What’s nice about the position I’m in is I get to ease my way into the work day. I come in, sip on my coffee, check emails, and get a general idea of how the day is going to look before it gets going. Even then, the work involves much more thought and working through problems as opposed to the automated process of Starbucks. 

“Yep, going to work to play barista simulator” is truly how it feels most days. It’s mind numbing and feels incredibly overwhelming sometimes. I enjoyed the craft, I enjoyed connecting with customers (before it was *expected* of you), it was genuine.

I never understood how draining the work was until I left. Having worked all day parts, there’s really no consistency (yes, and no). My days off always felt too short because it’s one day off separating 2/3 days of work. There’s no time for rest. OR I have two days off, but have to open the next day so my evening is cut short. Not to mention, there was always the risk of being called to cover a shift on your day off, thwarting any idea of feeling off — even if you don’t say yes. 

Some of you reading this (if you made it this far) are reading this on your first 10 — or your 30 if your manager sucks — because you had to open. Others are reading this because you closed and tend to stay up super late. 

I miss it, but I can never go back. There’s greater opportunities out there. Greater pay, more meaningful work, even working less hard for even greater pay. My position, for instance, feels waaaay less tiring but I get paid a lot more. I also go home and have the energy to do things and be a person and no longer need 30 minutes to become a person again. 

If you’re thinking of leaving, just do it. You’ll be happier in the other side. I miss my partners every day. I miss my customers every day. But I feel like my life really got started after I left Starbucks. I felt really emotional about it. I cried real tears leaving the company. It hurt saying goodbye. But it was the greatest decision I ever made. There’s no way I could have stayed long enough to take my coffee break, I wouldn’t have made it. 

TLDR: Starbucks is not worth the work we put in. If you’re considering leaving, I’d say do it. There’s greater opportunities out there, no matter how much you love your store. Your best life may be on the other side of the bar ❤️

hey everyone, figured i'd share this hack from the last time the super bowl was in santa clara, it's a huge lifesaver since stadium parking is a nightmare and honestly way too expensive.  
  
the move is to park at the great mall of the bay area in milpitas and take the vta light rail. the mall is right next to the milpitas bart station and the vta light rail station. from there, you hop on the vta orange line which takes you right to the great america station or lick mill station, both are right by levi's stadium. it avoids all the traffic snarls right around the stadium. they're preparing for massive crowds for super bowl lx, so this transit option is key.  
  
you can also find private parking nearby that might feel a little safer or be cheaper than official lots if you check out an app like prked. it's for renting driveways or garages from people who live close to the stadium or one of the transit stops. it's vip parking without the crazy cost, your car is on someone's property so it feels a lot more secure than a random lot, and you get quick in and out without the parking chaos. you can usually grab a spot that's even closer to the stadium than the affordable official lots, or right near the vta line.  
  
now, for the great mall/vta plan, you'll need to be ready for special event service. last time around for the big game, vta ran limited-stop trains and required a special eventtik fare, which was like 20 dollars round-trip. expect them to do the same this time around. make sure you check the official vta site a few weeks before february 8, 2026, for the exact super bowl lx transit details. they usually release the final schedule and required ticket info very close to the event.  
  
a quick tip for after the game: the light rail line out will be very crowded, so be prepared for a long wait to get on the train, or consider grabbing a coffee or something inside before heading out to the station queue. it's still way better than sitting in your car for two hours just to get out of the parking lot.  
  
hope this helps everyone save some cash and keep their sanity on game day.",1,1767860553.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

 She gave a weak sigh, eyes glistening. “You shouldn’t be wasting your life on me, Venus. You’re only twenty-two. You should be out there living, dancing, falling in love…”

 “Stop.” I tucked a stray curl behind her ear and kissed her forehead. “You don’t worry about anything. I’ve got us.”

 Her voice dropped. “How’s your dad?”

 My jaw clenched.

 Of course, she couldn’t meet my eyes. The man hadn’t visited once since her diagnosis.

 “I haven’t seen him since Sunday,” I said flatly. “And I hope I don’t. It’s been peaceful.”

 She opened her mouth—probably to defend him again—but I stood. “I have to get to work, Mom. I’ll see you later.”

 Two months working under him, and I swear he gets off on making my life miserable. Impossible deadlines, inhuman workload, cold stares that could freeze hell itself. And yet he hasn’t fired me. Because no matter how much he wants to break me, I always deliver.

 Why not quit, you ask?

 Because I can’t. I was a waitress before this, barely surviving. This job is the reason my mother has a bed in a hospital and not a floor in a rundown clinic. I have a degree, yes. But the world doesn’t pay in potential, it pays in cold, hard results.

 The cab pulled up in front of the towering steel-and-glass building I now called hell. I paid, got out, and took a deep breath.

 Showtime.

 \------

 The second I stepped into my office—just a thin wall away from Mr. Sinclair’s—the intercom rang.

 “My office. Now.”

 No greeting. Just that voice. Sharp. Clipped. Cold.

 “God, give me strength,” I muttered and walked to his door.

 Knock.

 “Come in.”

 I entered and stood straighter than usual. “Good morning, Mr. Sinclair. You called for me?”

 He didn’t look up right away. When he did, those hazel eyes locked on mine like a sniper's target.

 “Sit,” he said, irritation laced in every syllable.

 I sat. The silence stretched. Long enough to make me fidget. Then—

 “Marry me.”

 I blinked. My brain stalled.

 “What?”

 “Don’t make me repeat myself,” he said smoothly, like he hadn’t just shattered reality.

 And just like that, my nightmare said he wanted to make it legal.

Chapter 2

VENUS

 “Marry me.”

 My brain short-circuited.

 “W-what?” I blinked, pushing up my oversized glasses—scratched, crooked, and clinging to life like my sanity. His eyes tracked the motion, brimming with disdain. Typical.

 “You heard me,” he replied coolly, like he’d just asked for a meeting reschedule, not proposed marriage to the woman he’s treated like corporate lint for two months straight.

 God, I loathe this man.

 “What, is this some new psychological warfare tactic?” I folded my arms. “Because the emotional labor you’ve inflicted isn’t quite enough?”

 “Marry me and I—”

 “No.” My voice cut through the tension like a blade. Sharp. Final.

 He blinked. Just once. But I saw it—surprise. As if the idea of being turned down had never occurred to him.

 “No?” he echoed, mildly offended.

 Didn't think I'd ever speak back, did you?

 “Want it in Spanish? French? Morse code?”

 “You haven’t even heard my offer.”

 “I don’t want your offer.” My voice rose. “I’m not interested in whatever twisted bargain you’ve cooked up in that emotionally unavailable brain of yours.”

 He leaned back in his chair, lips twitching. Not quite a smirk, something colder.

 “One million dollars.”

 Silence. 

 My heart stuttered. He's crazy. I was genuinely concerned now, Did he hit his head or something?

 “A million?” I asked, incredulous. “You think throwing money at me will fix the months you’ve spent micromanaging me into oblivion? You’ve treated me like disposable help, now suddenly I’m bride material?”

 “You’ll have time to consider,” he said evenly. Calm. Measured. Calculating. Like he hadn’t just upended my world.

 I scoffed and slammed a folder on his desk. “Here’s the report you asked for. And no, I’m not for sale. You’re not the devil in disguise, Sinclair. You are the disguise.”

 Then I walked out.

 And for the first time since I started working for him… there was no retaliation. No snide remarks. No passive-aggressive memos.

 Just silence.

 It should’ve felt like peace.

 It didn’t.

 By the time I left work, the weight of it all was pressing on my chest—like the moment before a storm. I ran into Jude at the elevator.

 “You’re heading out early,” he noted.

 “Yeah,” I said with a tired smile. “Gotta check on Mom.”

 “Tell her I said hi.”

 I nodded, waved, and headed home hoping for quiet.

 I got it.

 But not the kind I wanted.

 The apartment was still. Too still.

 I opened my bedroom door and my stomach sank.

 Drawers overturned. Sheets yanked off. My closet wide open like a wound.

 “No,” I whispered, lunging for the box under my bed.

 Empty.

 All of it gone. Every dollar I’d scraped and saved for Mom’s chemo. Months of tips, late nights, skipped meals vanished.

 There was no sign of forced entry. No broken windows. No lock tampering.

 Just one conclusion.

 Only one person had a key.

 Only one person had ever taken more from me than he gave.

 Dain.

Chapter 3

VENUS

 I wiped my eyes before stepping into Mom’s ward. They must’ve been swollen. I hadn't stopped crying since dawn, and Dain? Still not picking up.

 “Hey, Mom,” I said, faking a smile so fragile it could crack if she blinked too hard.

 Her expression shifted instantly. “Venus, what’s wrong? You’ve been crying.”

 Of course she saw through it. She always does.

 “Yeah… my boss is being an ass again,” I lied. The truth would break her. And I couldn’t add one more crack to her already-fractured world.

 “Venus—” she started softly.

 “It was my fault. I don’t wanna talk about it,” I muttered, brushing it off like it didn’t weigh a ton.

 She didn’t push. Just reached for my hand. “Okay, darling. You don’t have to.”

 I nodded, swallowing the lump in my throat. “Did Dain come by?”

 “No... is he back home?” Her voice lifted, blooming with a hope that made me sick.

 That man didn’t deserve her hope.

 “No. He hasn’t.” My voice turned cold, sharp and bitter. She noticed.

 “Venus—”

 “I should go. You need rest. Chemo starts next week.”

 Another lie. It scorched my throat. God, I needed to make it true before it killed her.

 We hugged. She smelled like antiseptic and lavender. I held on too long. Then I left.

 The hospital was close, but each step felt like dragging a dead body—mine. The weight of hopelessness pressed on my shoulders, heavy and relentless. I kept hearing it—his voice.

 Marry me.

 Was he serious? Was it a game? A trap he’d enjoy watching me writhe in?

 The thought sickened me. The fact I was considering it? Worse.

 When I reached home, the front door was cracked open.

 No.

 I knew I locked it.

 I stepped in and there he was. Dain. Sprawled on the couch, reeking of sweat and stale alcohol. Passed out, useless.

 Disgust burned up my throat.

 I grabbed a cup, filled it with water, and dumped it on his face.

 “Get up, you asshole.”

 He bolted upright, sputtering. “What the fuck?! You little—”

 “You stole my money, Dain! Where is it?!”

 His bloodshot eyes lit up with smugness. “You had that much stashed and let Billy rough me up for peanuts? Selfish little bitch.”

 “You were never supposed to touch it. It was for Mom’s chemo.”

 He scoffed. “Why bother? She’s dying anyway.”

 That was it.

 “Shut up,” I snarled. “Shut your fucking mouth!”

 And then he slapped me.

 Hard.

 “That’s no way to talk to your father,” he slurred. “Didn’t your mother teach you—”

 I snapped.

 My eyes locked on a broken shard of glass near the table. I grabbed it, hand trembling but firm.

 “Get out. Now. Or I swear to God, I’ll gut you.”

 He paused. Blinked.

 The threat landed.

 He raised his hands, backing away. “Let’s not be hasty—”

 “I said get out!” I screamed, lunging a step forward.

 He stumbled. Then bolted.

 As the door slammed shut, I collapsed. Sinking to my knees, hands shaking, chest heaving. Then the tears came—violent, uncontrollable. Not soft sobs. This was grief, rage, helplessness all tangled in one.

 I sat in that storm for a long time.

 When the shaking slowed, I cleaned the house like it could scrub my shame. But I couldn’t outrun one thought:

 Mr. Sinclair.

 Maybe I should’ve listened. Maybe I should’ve asked more questions. Maybe—just maybe—he was serious.

 I hated him. Hated how cold he was. How powerful. How he always seemed ten steps ahead. But I had nothing left.

 Desperate people make stupid choices.

 I picked up my phone.

 He answered on the fourth ring.

 “About your offer…” My voice was hollow. “Were you serious?”

 “Yes.” No hesitation. No emotion. Just cold certainty.

 “Then I’ll take it,” I whispered. My pride shattered like glass on tile.

 “Good,” he said. Like he knew I’d fold. “We’ll discuss the terms tomorrow. At the office.”

 Click.

 Just like that, I traded my freedom for hope.

 If it saves her... maybe it’s worth it.

Chapter 4

AARON

 “She told me I’d fucking lost my mind and walked out,” I ranted, gripping the glass in my hand like it might keep me from exploding. Connor, the bastard, just laughed like I’d said the funniest joke of the year.

 “It isn’t funny,” I growled, though part of me knew it kind of was.

 “With that kind of approach, what did you expect, asshole?” he asked, finally sobering a little as he took a swig from his beer. “You’ve made her life a living hell for the past few months then out of nowhere, you waltz in and tell her to marry you? And you think she’d just... what? Say yes? Like you’re her Prince Charming or something? You’re fucking delusional.”

 I clenched my jaw, but I didn’t argue. Connor’s my best friend for a reason—he doesn’t sugarcoat shit. He never has. Doesn’t mean it’s easy to swallow when he spits the truth straight down your throat.

 “You came up with the idea,” I muttered bitterly, “Now I have to come up with Plan B. If I don’t get married within a month, all my hard work, my sacrifices, everything I’ve built, it’ll all go to waste.”

 Leave it to my grandfather to still have his claws in my life from beyond the grave. I hope you’re enjoying the show, old man. You always did love theatrics.

 The Will was read yesterday—my grandfather’s final punch from the beyond. According to it, I inherit 65% of the business empire, including the company we built together, only if I get married a month after his death. If I don’t, it all goes to my sorry excuse of a father.

 That will never happen. Over my dead fucking body.

 My grandfather practically raised me. He was the only real father figure I had growing up. I owe him everything. My drive, my grit, my ambition. But the man had a flair for drama, and apparently, he couldn’t rest in peace without one final power move. He knew how I felt about marriage. He knew the trauma my parents’ disaster of a union left behind. And yet, he still went ahead with this absurd condition.

 The worst part? It wasn’t just about getting married. No, that would’ve been too easy. It had to be for love. No business deal, no marriage of convenience. And the kicker? No divorce for at least three years. Classic him. Always pushing limits.

 So, Connor—brilliant, ruthless Connor—pitched a plan. “Marry your PA,” he said. “Fabricate a love story. You’ve known her long enough to sell it. Tell them you’ve been secretly seeing each other. No one will suspect it, and since you two clearly hate each other’s guts, there's no risk of catching feelings and complicating shit.”

 It was a sound plan. Elegant in its simplicity.

 Except... she said no.

 Of course, she said no.

 I downed the rest of my whiskey in one burning gulp. “I know what you’re about to ask. If I hate her so much, why the hell did I hire her?”

 Connor raised a brow but didn’t ask. He already knew.

 “She wasn’t my choice,” I continued bitterly. “My father hired her. Said I needed someone ‘competent’ watching over me.” That was his way of saying he didn’t trust me. I tried firing her the first week, but the contract was ironclad. The only way she could leave was if she quit. And believe me, I’ve tried to break her spirit. Overloaded her with work, gave her impossible deadlines, made her life absolute hell.”

 “She never cracked,” Connor said with a shrug. “She delivers. Every damn time. I’d keep her too.”

 “She’s obedient to a fault,” I muttered. “Quiet. Disciplined. Annoyingly professional. She never talks back—until today. Today she grew a spine. The one day I needed her to say yes, she decides she has standards.”

 “I was wondering when she would.” Connor smirked. “She picked the wrong fucking time, though.”

 “Damn right,” I grumbled.

 Before he could say more, his phone buzzed, and he slid off his barstool. “I gotta take this. Be back in a bit.”

 I nodded, swirling the remaining ice in my glass, lost in thought.

 That’s when I felt it—a hand on my shoulder.

 “Hey, handsome,” came a sultry voice, sugary sweet and painfully fake. I looked up to see a woman with barely enough fabric on her chest to qualify as a top. Her cleavage was practically in my face. “Can I buy you a drink?”

 Normally, I’d say yes. I’d take the distraction, the escape, the body and the night. But tonight wasn’t the night. Tonight, everything felt... wrong.

 “Not interested,” I replied, forcing my voice to stay calm.

 But she didn’t budge.

 “Just one drink, and then maybe—”

 My phone rang, cutting her off. I’ve never been more grateful for an interruption.

 I excused myself without looking back, stepping out into the cool night air as I answered.

 My eyebrows raised at the caller ID. My PA. Interesting.

 I picked up.

 “About your offer this morning…” Her voice was shaky, hesitant. “Were you... were you serious?”

 “Yes.” No hesitation. No need for it.

 “I... I’ll take it then.”

 I could hear the effort behind her words. The quiet surrender. Something must’ve broken her between this morning and now. I didn’t ask. It wasn’t curiosity holding me back—it was restraint. If she was desperate enough to agree, she’d reached her breaking point.

 And I wasn’t cruel enough to dig into that pain.

 “Good,” I said, my tone cool and measured. “We’ll discuss the terms and details tomorrow. At the office.”

 Then I ended the call and slid the phone back into my pocket.

 She said yes.

 This might actually work.

 Or... it might ruin everything.

 But for now, I’ve got a fiancée to make.

Chapter 5

VENUS

My alarm blared, jolting me awake from the uncomfortable position I had fallen asleep in. My neck ached, my back protested, and my mind was already racing.

I lay still for a moment, staring at the cracked ceiling. Did I really agree to this?

The question looped in my head like a broken record. Did I really make the right choice?

I groaned and rubbed my eyes, forcing myself to sit up. I was doing this for Mom. I'd do anything for her. Anything.

Dragging myself out of bed, I went about my morning routine like a zombie. A quick shower, hair pulled into a messy bun, and makeup kept minimal—just enough to look alive. I slipped into a plain white shirt and an ash-grey skirt—one of the few decent outfits I'd managed to afford since I started working at Sinclair Tech. It wasn’t glamorous, but it was clean and presentable.

I checked the clock. Only five minutes left if I wanted to make it on time. Great.

Grabbing a granola bar from the nearly empty kitchen shelf, I rushed to the door. But when I opened it, I came to an abrupt stop. I was blocked by someone.

Billy.

""Bi—Billy?"" I stammered, my heart skipping a beat.

He leaned against the doorframe, arms folded, eyes cold. He owned the casino where my father, Dain, loved to gamble, get drunk, and bury his problems in white powder. This wouldn’t be his first time showing up at our place to collect a debt. And he always made my skin crawl. The way he looked at me? It gave me the creeps.

""Where’s Dain?"" he gruffed, rubbing his scruffy beard.

""I don’t know,"" I replied quickly, stepping slightly back.

""He owes me money.""

That can’t be right. He took all my whole savings yesterday. What the hell did he use it for, then?

""Like I said, I don’t know where he is. I kicked his drunken ass out last night.""

Billy’s eyes narrowed slightly. ""That so?""

""Look, Billy, I have somewhere to be, and I’m already running late.""

He gave me a slow once-over, raising a brow before licking his lips in that disgusting way that made me want to gag.

""One day, Venus,"" he muttered, like a warning—or a promise I wanted nothing to do with—before walking away.

I slammed the door shut and locked it, chest heaving. Disgusting creep.

When I stepped outside and began walking to the main road, a car sped by, splashing a puddle of dirty water all over me.

""Asshole!"" I screamed, but the driver didn’t stop or even glance back.

I looked down at my soaked clothes and groaned. I couldn’t walk into Sinclair Tech looking like this. I didn’t even have anything clean to change into. I hadn’t gotten around to doing my laundry this week.

Frustrated and wet, I went back inside and tore through my closet. Finally, I found an old sweater tucked in the back. It was faded, a little baggy, but dry and warm. It would have to do.

With no time left to mope, I hurried back outside and managed to hail a cab. But of course, traffic was an absolute nightmare. Cars crawled at a snail’s pace, horns blaring like a symphony of doom.

It was almost like the universe was throwing every obstacle at me. One final warning. One last chance to back out of the deal I’d made with the devil.

But I wouldn’t. I couldn’t. This was for Mom. She needed me to do this.

I arrived twenty minutes late. Not the best impression to make on the first day of your fake engagement.

Sinclair Tech’s lobby was intimidating—marble floors, modern furniture, and pristine glass everywhere. The receptionist glanced at me and gave a polite smile. I forced one back and rushed to the elevator.

My heart pounded harder with every floor the elevator climbed. I adjusted my sweater, took a deep breath, and stepped out on the top floor.

The door to the executive conference room was already open.

Connor sat on the far side of the table, sipping coffee like he hadn’t a care in the world. Aaron stood by the window, suit perfectly tailored, arms crossed, exuding power and ice.
