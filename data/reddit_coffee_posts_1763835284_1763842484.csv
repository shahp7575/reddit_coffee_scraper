It feels dumb to say, but you might phrase as I am a college student who is severely infatuated with a woman at my college.  I've known her for maybe 2 months, but when she looked into my eyes and told me she cares about me and that she is glad that I was there it was as though a seed was planted in my mind that quickly became a massive tree.  I don't seem to be able to get rid of this tree and the tree only seems to grow larger and it's roots deepen as time goes on.  

She and I spent a fair amount of time speaking last night and a college club, and then I saw this strange thing in my sleep.  I've lost my head over this woman and I wish it wasn't like that.  I don't really want to have this fixation on a woman, I don't entirely view myself as prepared for a woman or a relationship, but I feel like maybe I'd be a fool not to ask her out on a date for coffee or something.

  
What to do?

1p42wwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1p42wwd/the_aftermath_of_dating_a_loser/,The aftermath of dating a loser,"I don’t hear about this enough but the aftermath of dating a loser is truly an interesting journey. For me, my self esteem was shattered after breaking things off with somebody who couldn’t even express true love. I felt like I was completely unloveable and not worthy of a relationship. It didn’t help that he was my first boyfriend.

For months, I was waiting for him to reach out, to finally take accountability. Maybe even catch up over coffee. But I knew him. He loved playing the victim in every single incident of his life — he could never do no wrong. And even if he did realize his wrongdoings, he will never openly admit it. I honestly like to say his ego got in the way of us having a fulfilling relationship. Yet, I still had hope he changed.

As for him being a “loser”. He wanted the easy route in everything he did. He cheated on almost every assignment all the way through graduation. He was 23 and hardly worked any jobs despite having plenty of free time. His parents gave him an allowance. We literally had to organize our dates or simple plans around the date of his “payday” but even then, he wasted his money on the dumbest things oh my goodness. There’s so much more but it’s laughable looking back. 

I was considering following him on instagram earlier this week because his friend follows me (I only accepted because I actually enjoyed the time I spent getting to know her) so I would not be surprised if he’s already up to date on my life. He requested to follow back in September a couple days after his friend did after I removed him in July but I declined because I thought it was such a pussy move. But then I got really sick recently and got flashbacks to when I was even more sick in the spring where he showed absolutely no concern whatsoever until I told him to. He was even aggressive when we were intimate around that time, knowing my body couldn’t handle it. That was honestly my second to final straw. I brought up his lack of concern during the breakup and even then, he still didn’t get my frustration. He deflected like his life depended on it. I just wanted him to actually show that he “loved” me. 

Now, I know I’m genuinely better off without ever seeing him again, truly. This isn’t relevant and might come off as conceited but I don’t think he could do better than me, at least while he’s still this way. He’s attracted to drama and chaos, from what I’ve learned about his lengthy past. He doesn’t take time to heal — he finds the next girl to occupy his time. I like to say dating is his favorite hobby. He will never admit it but he doesn’t respect himself. And I know I deserve so much better and I mean it. It’s been 5 months and my confidence has never been better. I’m single and relearning how to love being alone and it’s been amazing. I have a much better understanding of what I like and don’t like and that doesn’t just apply to dating but hobbies as well. I have a clearer view of what career path I want to take. I never imagined being this content with silence.

TL;DR: Breaking up with my ex was the best thing I’ve ever done and I’m grateful for dating a loser because now I think I’m the shit. And please do not follow your ex on social media or break no contact, it’s not worth it.",1,1763842228.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

_______________________________________

One day I'm going to wake up, 
as the sunlight streaks gently through my room.

the only sounds of the morning will be keys gently clinging,
the gentle goodbyes,
the rumble of coffee machines.
there will be no tension.
no anger.

I'll wake up, and stretch, and won't have to check my phone. it'll be right next to me.
I'll walk downstairs when I'm ready, and she'll happily greet me with a sleepy hello, and ask if I want some coffee.

if I say no, she accepts it without question and asks me what I'm up to today.
I toast some bread and brew some tea, and we talk as the sun rises.

I put my plates gently in the sink, and take the rest of my tea with me upstairs. I step into the bathroom, and don't bother locking it. I take a deep breath.

The cool water Cascades down my skin, gently, calmly, the only sounds I hear are my roommate guiding the dogs outside to play. No obligations, no hard feelings. Tuesdays are her day.

my phone rings, but I don't answer it.
I rub gentle lavender soap all over my skin, and stretch in the warm twinkling shower water. I enjoy the water for 20 minutes, as long as I want, as long as MY schedule allows. It warms up my bones and I step out of the shower slowly to put my contacts in.
I'm okay. I'm safe. I can breathe. It's my terms. It's me now.

———————————————————————
Its so eye opening to see this little blurb i wrote about what i hoped my life would look like once I moved out. I mean all of this, at the time i was writing it was a purely fantasy. It seemed as much of a fantasy as living in a fairytale land in a castle with flying dragons and magic wands. 

It’s what I hoped for, but i had very little belief that it could actually come to fruition. Because at this time in my life i had very little faith for the future. I honestly didn’t believe I’d be able to stay alive much longer. 

I didn’t believe id ever actually be able to afford to move out. Not only that, but I didn’t believe I’d have the strength or bravery to move out. Moving out was the “Big Bad” to my family. It was the worst possible thing I could inflict on my family. It would be an absolute betrayal. 

And even if I somehow ever wouldve be able to get over the crippling fear and guilt, I didnt think it would happen within the near future. Like not for another 10+ years, and I was about 18 when i wrote this. 

And above all, I thought that even against all odds, if i somehow was able to move out, I truly believed i would never have mornings like this. i knew logically that things on the “outside” were likely at least somewhat better than what i had been dealing with at home, but i thought those instances were far and few in between. i had become so accustomed to my living situation that it became my baseline.

But now Ive been living on my own for 4 years now. I have mornings like this DAILY. In fact I have all kinds of mornings. Mornings from sleepovers, mornings from camping, morning of a calm and happy christmas and mornings after a night out. 

What I’ve come to find out, is that people like my parents and living situations like the one i was in, are actually what is far and few in between. To my surprise, the world is actually full of good and decent people. 

Most people are kind and genuine and caring. Most people respect me as a person and my boundaries. Most people treat me like a human being. and I have the ability to leave the people who treat me badly.

Logically i know it was bad back then, but i cant truly recognize it in its entirety until i read these little time capsules. where waking up to a calm and peaceful home was a fantasy for me. or to be able to say no to an offer and have that respected. or to be able to shower for as long as i want and to be on my schedule. i still dont think i’ve fully fully realized that im moved out and im on my own rules now, it just feels normal to me, until i read something like this again. it makes me really happy. in 2019 i never thought id be able to move out or live an semblance of a happy life, and in 2025 it’s so commonplace that i take it for granted. truly insane.",1,1763842171.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

· Did you have luck with Bumble BFF or Meetup? Any groups in particular?

This is simply my experience with understanding why people vouch for it. I am **NOT** an expert, I know nothing. I am **NOT** a bitcoin enthusiast. I **DO NOT** own bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency). This post is (**1**) to further my understanding of Bitcoin, by combating or accepting any rebuttals that may be posed and (**2**) a form of education for individuals who want a deeper understanding. **DO NOT** respond with anything that clearly lacks thought. Please let me know if I’m being naïve on certain points or if what I’ve written actually makes sense. I could 100% be wrong. Please don’t ask for sources, I’m lazy. Do your own due diligence.

**What is Bitcoin (to the average person)**

To the vast majority of the public, Bitcoin is a contradiction. It is simultaneously magic internet money, a speculative gambling tool, and a dark-web currency for criminals.

If you ask the average person on the street what Bitcoin is, you will likely hear:

\-          “It’s Crypto”

\-          “It’s fake money”: Since you cannot hold it in your hand and isn’t backed by a government, the assumption is that it is backed by nothing but hype.

\-          “It’s a bubble”: because the price crashes by 50% or more every few years, it is viewed as a volatile, gambling asset that will eventually go to zero when the greater fools run out.

Now I will admit I have used all these three as a response. Not to say that they are not true. At this moment in time, with the current perspective people have towards it, yes these points are valid.

The misconception is that people view Bitcoin as a financial product rather than a technological foundation (like the internet). It’s important to stop looking at it as a “get rich quick” scheme and start viewing it as a competing infrastructure to the Central Bank.

[ ]()

**Flaws with the Fiat-based Financial System**

I am **NOT** hating on Fiat, I am simply pointing out factual flaws within the system. Just because I am pointing these flaws out **DOES NOT** mean I believe the fiat system should be abolished. **EVERYTHING** has flaws. It is **OKAY** to accept that flaws exist.

\-          Inflation/Debasement

In the Roman era, they physically “debased” the currency by diluting the denarius to make more of them. Today, we debase currencies by increasing the M2 Money Supply. The method is different but the result is the same.

This results in a system where it is mathematically difficult to accumulate capital. The money you save today is guaranteed to buy less tomorrow. Since the creation of the Fed in 1913, the US Dollar has lost over **96%** of its purchasing power. Why? because money is meant to be spent, not saved.

Thus there is an obvious flaw within the system. No one can maintain their wealth without taking risks by investing in Stocks or Bonds or whatever. To the average person, this makes no sense. The equation doesn’t add up. Something is missing.

Bitcoin’s Architecture

\-          **Supply**

There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin. Increased demand never creates increased supply. If Gold goes up, miners find more gold thus increasing the supply (same with fiat, and every other commodity). This directly challenges the inflation issue (HUGE assumption: Bitcoin does not remain as volatile as it is now – ill go further into this point later). This is something everyone and their grandma has heard so I wont go much further.

\-          **Proof of Work**

Now how do you replace a financial system that requires a bank or government in charge. You replace trust with work. Bitcoin is secured by energy (we’ll come to this later). To update the ledger, computers must expend electricity to solve a cryptographic puzzle. You cannot fake the energy required to mine Bitcoin.

\-          **Miners (New Bankers)**

Miners replace the Central Bank’s role of processing transactions, but they do NOT replace the Central bank’s power. Bankers make the rules, while Miners follow them (or uselessly struggle against it and are left behind). If a miner tries to cheat, the rest of the network simply rejects their work. They are not gatekeepers; they are digital security guards that are incentivised to protect the ledger.

The mining process goes something like this: There is a waiting room (mempool) full of transactions that have yet to be validated and added to the blockchain. Miners scoop up these pending transactions and bundle them together in a block. To add this block to the permanent record (the blockchain), the miners must solve extremely difficult mathematical puzzles. This requires massive amounts of energy/computing power (proof of work aspect). The miner who solves the puzzle first gets to add the block to the chain. In exchange for their work and energy they are paid with transactions fees and new minted bitcoin (for now).

Thus Miners must be honest to get paid. If they try to cheat or insert invalid transactions, the rest of the network rejects the block, and they burn electricity for nothing.

Economic Rebuttals:

**1.      It has no intrinsic value**

I think this is based on a misunderstanding of what value is and what Bitcoin’s purpose is.

A glass of water has no value to someone drowning, but infinite value to a man dying of thirst. Bitcoin has no physical utility, but it has massive monetary utility. It creates a ledger that is unseizable, censorship-resistant, and portable. Consider a refugee fleeing a war zone (**or anyone moving for any reason**). Gold (or cash) is heavy and gets confiscated at the border, a bank account gets frozen, a house cannot be carried. Bitcoin allows anyone to travel anywhere with their entire life savings. The intrinsic value is the ability to restart your life – hope for the future – rather than starting from zero.

Bitcoin is not backed by “nothing”; it’s backed by the billions of dollars in energy and hardware required to secure the network. It has a cost of production, just like gold (arguable more ethical). You cannot fake energy; you must pay for it.

**2.      It’s too volatile**

This critique judges bitcoin as if it were a mature store of value, not a developing one. Volatility is a function of size. If you throw a rock into a puddle, it splashes violently. If you throw a rock into an ocean, it barely moves. As Bitcoin grows, the volatility naturally decreases.

Bitcoin is attempting to go from 0 to the value of a Global Reserve Asset. The volatility comes with the territory. Yes, it is a terrible store of value short term. But it’s an excellent one long term. The volatility is the risk tax you pay for being early (the word early doesn’t need to be critiqued, you get the point). You are compensated with high returns for taking high risk (which also relates to people complaining about early adopters – you knew about it you just weren’t willing to risk your money on it, same as every stock ever).

Gold was also incredibly volatile in the 1970s when it was decoupled from the dollar and had to find its new fair market value. Stability is the final stage of adoption, not the first.

**3.      It’s a Ponzi scheme**

I just want to first say I believe that every cryptocurrency that has jumped on the back of bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme.

The critique is (which I myself have used) that early adopters only make money if new people join. You are recruiting greater fools. Bitcoin lacks the three things that make up a Ponzi scheme: A central operator (could be argued and I can see why), isn’t secretive, in fact the opposite, it is open source and can be audited by anyone 24/7. Finally it offers no yield, it is simply a commodity like gold (the price is simply a representation of its growing value and demand).

Bitcoin follows the economics of a network, not a scam. An example – if you are the only person with a telephone, it has zero value. If two people have them, it has little value. If a billion people have them, the network is immensely valuable to everyone.

You aren’t recruiting greater fools to pay you out. Every new user adds liquidity and security, making the network more useful for all participants (including new ones). This is why Amazon, Facebook and the Internet itself grew – not because they were Ponzi’s, but because networks become more valuable as they get larger.

**4.      Only Criminals use it**

This narrative is outdated. Right now, criminal usage is actually extremely low. It was high during the Silk Road Era, but today, the vast majority of usage is investment/institutional.

Also like every new technology, early adopters are criminals because they are operating on the fringes. Criminals are incentivised to try everything to see what’s most effective (clearly that’s no longer bitcoin).

Also criminals will always exist. The vast majority of global money laundering and drug purchasing is conducted in US Dollars (cash). We don’t ban the dollar just because Pablo Escobar used it.

In fact Bitcoin is actually terrible for crime. It is a public ledger. Every transaction is permanently recorded. Using bitcoin for crime is like robbing a bank and leaving a trail of GPS coordinates leading to your house. Bitcoin is pseudonymous (like a username) not anonymous.

**5.      Artificial Inflation**

This is a valid critique of the crypto market, but not of Bitcoin Itself. It is impossible to print more Bitcoin. However, it is possible for centralised exchanges to manipulate the exchange rate of Bitcoin. Unethical exchanges may sell Bitcoin they don’t actually have (paper bitcoin). They take your money and give you an IOU on a screen. This creates artificial supply. Conversely, if stablecoin issuers (like tether) print unbacked tokens to buy Bitcoin, they create artificial demand. This is not a problem with Bitcoin, it a problem with the ones taking advantage of it (back to my 4^(th) point “only criminals use it”). If Tether were to collapse, or if everyone withdrew their coins from exchanges to their wallet, the price of Bitcoin would likely crash in the short term as the “fake leverage” is wiped out. However, this would actually be a good thing that strips away the manipulation and reveals the true, uncorrupted market value of the network.

 

Technical Rebuttals:

**1.      It can be Forked**

This is a misunderstanding of what forking is. Copying the code does not mean changing the network. Bitcoin code is open source so anyone can copy it, change a few lines and launch it. This counts as a fork. These forks don’t matter if no one uses them. Its like taking the code for Facebook and launching it as Facebook 2.0. One issue with that is it’s useless since it doesn’t have the billions of users the original has.

An example of this was in 2017, where a group of powerful corporate miners and exchanges tried to force a change in the code (increasing the block size). The users refused to upgrade to the new version. The corporate group was forced to split off and create Bitcoin Cash. This failed. The market overwhelmingly chose the original Bitcoin, proving that you cannot force changes onto the network, no matter how rich or powerful you are.

**2.      51% Attack**

Critics argue that if someone controls 51% of the computing power, they rule the network and can steal everyone’s money. Even with 99% of the power, an attacker cannot steal your bitcoin (they don’t have your private keys) and they cannot change the 21 million supply (the rest of the network’s users would reject these as invalid rules – example below). They could censor specific transactions temporarily, or double-spend their own recent transactions. To achieve this, an attacker would need to buy more hardware than exists in the entire market. IF they did succeed, they would destroy the trust of the entire network, crashing the price of the very asset they spent billions to attack. So it is always more profitable to use that power to mine honestly than to attack.

Critics also point to 51% attacks on other chains as proof it can happen. This whole reason is the exact point of Bitcoins PoW system. Those small chains had low hash rates, making them cheap to attack.

**3.      184 Billion Bug**

Yes the code did fail in this instance. But it proves Bitcoin is not just software. It is a social agreement. The moment the code violated the 21 million rule, the human participants rejected it. This happened in 2010 when Bitcoin had almost no value and very few eyes on the code. Today, the Bitcoin Core code is perhaps the most scrutinized open-source software in history. A bug this simple is virtually impossible today, but even if it happened, the 2010 incident proves the network would just reject it again.

**4.      It is Dumb**

Bitcoin’s purpose is not for smart contracts, DeFi etc. It’s intentionally limited – it prioritises security over complexity.

**5.      Speed**

Apps like PayPal don’t move money instantly; it moves a message about money instantly. The actual settlement takes days. Bitcoin moves the actual final asset instantly. You are confusing 'messaging speed' with 'settlement speed’. Regardless, Bitcoins purpose is not to facilitate every coffee transaction globally, it’s the foundation that the rest of the system settles on.

**6.      Selfish Mining**

Miner C finds a block and hides it and starts secretly working on the next block. Their goal is to build a secret chain that is longer than the public one and then release it all at once to overwrite the public chain.

This is incredibly risky. While Miner C is hiding their block, the rest of the world is still mining. If ANY other miner in the world finds a block before Miner C finds their second secret block, Miner C’s secret block becomes worthless. Miner C has therefore wasted massive amounts of electricity for zero reward.

**7.      Unfair Miner Advantages**

If an individual has more computers than another they will solve puzzles faster. This is proof of work. Unlike the fiat system, where being close to the money printer gives you an unfair advantage, with Bitcoin you are paid exactly the proportion to the effort and energy you provide. Sure it may not be fair but its how everything else works. If you have more than 1 lottery ticket you have hypothetically a higher chance of winning.

Other Rebuttals:

**1.      Energy Issue**

[Bitcoin Revolutionizing Renewable Energy w/ Daniel Batten (BTC225)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq5DQFugOv8)

The main criticism is that Bitcoin uses more energy than countries. This however conflates energy consumption with carbon emissions. Bitcoin is effectively subsidised by waste, using energy that others would not use. It is also important to note that Gold mining causes more damage to the Earth.

You also don’t measure the energy costs of millions of bank servers, ATMs, security and the military force that backs respective currencies. Just like these are non-negotiable costs for security, the same applies for bitcoin.

**2.      Criminals lack of punishments**

While bitcoin cannot be frozen, the exchanges can be. If the criminal tries to convert that bitcoin into dollars, the exchange will flag the “tainted” coins and arrest them.

 

Flaws with Bitcoin

See Bitcoin also has flaws. I will reiterate: **NOTHING** is flawless.

**6.      Irreversibility**

Although the reason for this is to prevent chargeback fraud, I will say that the fact you cannot reverse a transaction does sound/feel wrong. However, as I said before Bitcoin shouldn’t be used for coffee transactions and should only potentially be used for the most important forms of transacting. Still irreversibility in my eyes feels wrong.

**7.      Simultaneous Block Problem**

It is possible for two miners to solve the puzzle at the same time, meaning half the network updates with Block A and the other half updates with Block B. The network waits for the next block to break the tie. So if Miner C’s next block is on top of Miner A’s, then Miner A’s chain becomes the longest chain and thus abandons Miner B’s block. The transactions in the loser block are not lost, they are just sent back to the waiting room.

So while you don’t lose the money (it gets mined again in the next block), the uncertainty is a massive user experience failure. This requires users to wait for multiple confirmations for large purchase, which actually is usually hidden by the banks (back to point 5. Speed).  

 

My hypothetical Bitcoin based system

\-          **L1: The foundation (Bitcoin blockchain)**

This is a highly secure foundation. Its purpose is not for speed. It is the one record in the world that cannot be edited, deleted or reversed. If Layer 1 was fast and cheap, it would be easily attacked. The transactions that occur here are the most important globally. A bit like the Fedwire (which is also irreversible).

\-          **L2: The Day-to-day payment system**

Its role is for instant payments and financial contracts. Not too sure about the specifics on this one. Any thoughts are appreciated.

\-          **L3: Support/Community Bank**

I think this could be used for two things. Help with the fear of self-custody since if you lose your password you lose everything. Not too sure how it would work either but its intention is to make the barrier to entry lower. Maybe it could also deal with taxes and similar.

Another use could be for rare global disasters. E.g. during COVID instead of having to print tons of money, they could have offered credits for specific goods/services (food, rent, medicine). Because they are temporary and targeted they don’t undermine the base system (L1) or destabilise everyday spending (L2).

This allows support for individuals during unexpected disasters, without undermining the financial system. Even if people receive food credits, they still need to work to pay for other things (tax, non-essential services, private education etc.) These are a non-inflationary, consumable, temporary and limited solution to crises.

Another great thing about this system is the fact that everything is traceable on L1. So you can see exactly how the government for example is spending your taxes.

 

I think all this goes through my thought process and understanding of Bitcoin pretty well. Like I said at the start, any thought out rebuttals are definitely appreciated. It would also be interesting to see people’s thoughts on this 3 layered system so feel free to share any ideas you have. Let me know if this is worth posting anywhere else!

Part 2- Yoshikage Kira

7:24. Back in time. *Once again.* 

Kira stood facing his mirror, examining the body he stole. He adjusted his feline tie, fastened his belt, tucked in his shirt, as he had done countless times before in pure glee. *Immortality.* The word made Kira laugh. *Thank you Hayato.* *How many can I kill before time is up?*

That pesky son of his was worth thanks, for this new time-turning ability was all that rat’s fault. On the train back from S-City, two filthy paupers irritated the mighty Kira, and the gnawing was getting too great to ignore. But he was sloppy. Hayato had stalked him from the train station while he followed them home, watching all the while when he blew the boyfriend to smithereens and severed the girlfriend’s hand. The boy had tried to blackmail him- demand he leave, or he would tell the world the identity of Yoshikage Kira. Of course, the woman with the only Stand capable of changing his face Kira had murdered. So, he acted rashly. Killed Hayato. Stuffed his body in a cabinet. He thought he was done for. *But then, I found the arrow.*

The Arrow was plunged into his flesh, his Killer Queen evolved, and before he knew it, he was outside his house, and an hour before he had murdered the boy. This new ability he called Bites the Dust, and it gave him immortality. From one point in the day he chooses, he can revert time all the way back to that point if that pig Hayato tells anyone his true identity, at the end of every hour. For four loops in a row he watched Kishibe Rohan explode and Hayato watch in horror, exactly an hour past his point, 8:24 on the dot. Even if Rohan doesn’t enquire about Yoshikage Kira, by merely speaking to Hayato, he will die, his fate predetermined by Kira himself. *This loop is nice, but it’s getting stale,* Kira thought. *One more run, and then I’ll ensure Hayato doesn’t speak to Rohan from 7:24 to 8:24. And then, maybe I’ll kill that bitch Shinobu. She has pretty hands, I’ll give her that,* 

He pulled down his blazer, a tiny blotch of tea strained in its corner. *Rats.* In one loop, that fool Shinobu had split her tea, and now it remained on him every time he reverted. *It appears I am unaffected by time. I carry each loop with me. But everyone else is none the wiser.* He checked his watch. 8:09. He always spent too much time in front of a mirror.

He descended to the kitchen, where Kosaku’s family dwelt. He was well aware of this day’s routine by now- Hayato sits down for a plate of sausages, scrambled eggs and green beans, the radio plays Jamiroquai, and Shinobu shatters her empty teapot because little Hayato wasn’t listening. He was all powerful, and they were ants to be trodden on underfoot.

He sat down and slurped his coffee, smirking at a stonefaced Hayato. 8:17. He munched on a sausage. 8:18. He chewed his nails while Shinobu yelled. 8:19. *The teapot.*

But there were no shards on the floor. No tears to be shed. No husband act for Kira to play. Hayato had caught the teapot, left hand ajar and prostrate, eyes forever focused on Kira’s. *How? Is it the tea stain? How could this little bastard know?* He began gnawing onto his fingers.

“Good catch Hayato.” Shinobu rustled his hair. “You boys should be off. It’s almost past 20.”

Kira stared at his watch, flabbergasted- all delusions of confidence shattered “Seems so. Come, Hayato. Let’s walk.” He repeated what he had said, words wavering in tone.

“Wait, Kosaku. You have tea on your shirt-

“It's fine honey. I'll get it changed later. Hayato, let’s move!” He snatched Hayato’s tiny hand, and they took to the streets of Morioh, by 8:21. *One minute late.*

Hayato seemed exactly the same as every other time they had walked the streets. They repeated their usual back-and-forth, Kira occasionally forgetting a line, eyes always darting to his watch. *Nothing can change where Rohan is now. He will die when he speaks to Hayato, whether he investigates me or not. Nothing can change that.* But if they were but a fraction too late, if they were even a second over 8:24, then Kira would have to wait an hour before time could reset. *That’s an hour I can’t afford.* The last time he fought Rohan and his team, he had to change his name, home and skin to escape. His Stand ability, Killer Queen, was strong, but only half as strong as Jotaro Kujo’s or Koichi Hirose’s. *I must outsmart these predators. You can’t stalk a stalker.*

Kira and Hayato reached their crossroads, where they had split a dozen times before. *8:22. Late. When Rohan dies again, I will never return to this loop.*

But before he could cross the road, he saw something new. Wandering towards them came a shuffling teen- baggy pants, navy blazer buttoned halfway, revealing a golden shirt underneath, and not to mention that ridiculous hairstyle. It was a thick, wavy pompadour, unfashionable to a fault, utterly ridiculous. But Kira’s face didn’t sour at that- oh no. This was a face he had seen before. A face after Jotaro Kujo had beaten him to a pulp. *Josuke Higashikata. Kujo’s illegitimate uncle.* Of course Higashikata wouldn’t recognize Kira’s new face. But if Rohan was tracking down Hayato, then so would Josuke and his pompadour.

“Excuse me sir, have you seen a goofy looking manga artist ‘round here?” he asked, a little confusion in his voice. Kira turned, but he felt Hayato’s hand tighten around his finger.

“Can’t say I have, boy.” Kira feigned. “Forgive me, but I-

“Hold up.” Josuke said, voice hardening. Kira checked his watch. *8:23. One minute. I’ve got to get out of here.* “I don’t want to sound like a serial killer, but are you Kosaku Kawajiri, by any chance?”

“Nope. Never heard that name.” Kira spun, but he felt the kid place a hand on his shoulder. He was pretty big for his age, a couple inches taller than Kira himself. *I can sense his Stand would beat mine.*

“No, I think you are. I’d like to ask you some questions, if you don’t mind.”

*20 seconds.* “I very much mind, boy. Take your hand off me!”

Just then, another schoolboy, clad in the same attire, but lacking the pompadour. He had tiny eyes and a fat mouth- two scars shaped like crescent moons dancing down his face. *Okuyasu Nijimura. The halfwit. They’ve trapped me.*

“Who’s that you got there Josuke?” *10 seconds.* Kira looked down at Hayato. His son stuck a hand into his father’s trouser, pulling out a large earring, about four inches long. Hayato stood on his toes, while Josuke and Okuyasu spoke.

*8 seconds.* “It’s Rohan’s.” *He’s clever, I’ll give him that.*

*6 seconds.* “You don’t know who you’re messing with, little boy.”  
*3 seconds.* “I think I do. I don’t make threats I can’t back up.”

*1 second.* Kira laughed. “You haven’t met my Killer Queen.”

“THAT MAN IS YOSHIKAGE KIRA! YOU HAVE EXACTLY ONE HOUR TO KILL HIM!” Hayato bellowed, as Kira’s watch ticked 8:24.

Silence erupted. Stands were summoned.

“KILLER QUEEN!”

“CRAZY DIAMOND!”  
“THE HAND!”

And the battle began.

Today I was in a coffee shop and a woman, after noticing me, decided to make a video that would end and focus on me.

For context, I wear specific religious clothing, and that may be interesting to others, but this seems beyond rude. I frowned at the woman and she seemed unbothered.

Can we as a society stop taking photos of strangers without their consent, especially in semi-private spaces like a business? This causes so much stress for me “being perceived”, and makes being in public even more stressful.

Once again you have absolutely ruined a game and a weekend. Your app is the single worst app I have used in 15 years. I must assume you all have 0 shame or consequences for your work, because because if I turned in something of the quality of what you provide at my job, I would be so ashamed of myself I would not be able to face anyone until the inevitable and justified dismissal.

Honestly, the fact that as a sports streaming service you are unable to stream sports should be an absolute embarrassment to anyone in your leadership team. 

That I can get better quality streams, online, for free makes the audacity of you charging for the absolute and abject failure of your service all the more galling. 

The quality of the video for the Ireland v South Africa game was like a 1980s cam corder. The buffering was like a YouTube video circa 2005. The sound and commentary dropped in and out like you were unsure if it was a minimum requirement. You failed in every aspect. 

It was unwatchable. It ruined all the big moments in a game I have been looking forward to for months. My expectations were low but holy fuck did you manage to find new lows, even for you. It is no wonder the company is failing in NZ. It should be humiliating for you that this is the best you are able to produce.

The only reason I purchased the app was for this game. Given its clear you are embezzling the funds you should be spending on even the basics of the service you are failing to offer I would quite like my money back,in full.

You have failed under the consumer guarantees act to provide the service purchased and, as you have ruined my weekend, I will pursue a campaign to ruin your work weeks until I receive my refund. 

It is not about the refund its about the principal. I work in scam and fraud prevention, and this is the most egregious and blatant scam I have come across. 

I am not looking to discuss this, I am not willing to negotiate. I don't want a hollow apology as this has been the quality you have provided for years and you are not sorry, except to be a sorry state. 

If you don't provide the refund I'm honestly so furious I will escalate this to the disputes tribunal so you have to face the ignominy of it being legal public record that you have failed at your jobs so totally.

I'll look forward to canceling my service, receiving my refund, and never having to deal with with you or your app again.

Norman loves the McRib; he eats it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with snacks in between, but comes to the devastating realisation that McDonald's refuses to put his favorite sandwich back on the menu. Unable to handle the lack of his pork sandwich, he alters his DNA to have everything taste like a McRib. Unfortunately, this causes him to become the Ribblin, a crazed maniac who flies around and fries people with his McRib laser, killing the McDonald's CEOs as revenge for removing the McRib from their menu.

Bugs Bunny and Spargle (The Looney Tunes Show) - In the episode ""Off Duty Cop,"" Bugs Bunny tries to lay off coffee since his doctor warns him that his caffeine levels are way too high. Struggling to find a substitute, he finds Yosemite Sam selling a new drink called Spargle, which he says is like coffee but lacks caffeine, causing Bugs to buy a whole month's worth of the drink. Soon, Bugs becomes addicted to the drink, his new levels of energy allowing him to do stuff such as making a buffet, writing a book, and putting his Christmas decorations up even though it's June. Soon, however, Bugs runs out of Spargle, and the drink is out of stock, so he drags Sam while in the shower to the factory to get more. However, this escalates due to a convergence with a B-plot involving Daffy becoming an undercover cop, causing Bugs to kidnap Porky Pig and threaten to write on his face with permanent ink unless he gets more Spargle, which escalates into a full-blown police stand-off. It is later revealed that the drink was made with several dangerous, addictive chemicals, forcing Bugs to enter rehab.

Someone warm, genuine, and open to seeing where things go. Ideally, our connection becomes a relationship, because that’s ultimately what I’m looking for.

I can host, drive, or pick you up if you’re comfortable with that. I’d love to chat on here first, and if we vibe, meet for a coffee, dinner or even a fun little pool date.

A bit about me: I recently opened a business, and between that and school I’m pretty driven and stay busy but would absolutely make time for the right person. I’ve also got a new dog I’m training myself but when I do get a free moment I enjoy gaming, building/crafting/working with my hands, playing piano, writing music, cooking, plants and gardening. In warmer weather I skateboard and play tennis, and this winter I’m hoping to finally try snowboarding. As of recent I’ve quit smoking weed and have no intentions of going back but wouldn’t mind some good conversation over a few drinks.

You: 21+ who’s in or near Vaughan/GTA. You communicate well, enjoy good conversation, appreciate honesty, and don’t mind some playful banter. You’re comfortable with closeness and affection that isn’t overly sexual in the beginning, and you like the idea of letting things build naturally. I’m open to any race or body type as I care far more about your personality, and the energy you bring than any specific look or shape. Bonus points if you enjoy dogs, cozy nights, laughter, or just having someone steady and supportive around.

What I’m like: I want something that flows naturally. The kind of connection where effort feels effortless. I’m the type of guy who checks in, listens attentively, and makes you laugh until your stomach feels like you just finished an ab workout. I’m honest. Sometimes brutally so.. because I’d rather tell the truth and deal with a moment of discomfort than lie and deal with the mess that comes after. Transparency and communication are very important to me.

I’m patient, emotionally intelligent, and financially independent. I value constructive criticism and have thick skin.  I enjoy banter, especially when the teasing builds on itself and becomes something original to us.

As for affection: I like to pamper and be pampered. Like hair play, head and back scratches, cuddles, kissing, making out — nothing overly sexual in the beginning. I just enjoy closeness, comfort, and warmth.

I’ve got a lot of affection and care to give, and I’m hoping to find someone who’s looking for the same.",2,1763840934.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

My family moved to Greenville in 1997 and my dad worked at Amatrol in Jeffersonville. We would constantly be there, New Albany and Clarksville for Groceries or to go out to eat etc. 

There was a day old bakery my Dad would go and load up on Bread and Snack Cakes because we lived on a farm and would give it to the goats and chickens as a treat but I would always case the bags to see what was too good to give to them that we would like. (Sometimes we would get boxes of the little debbie coffee cakes and I knew my Dad and I liked them and the goats and chickesn wouldn't benefit from those xD) but we would also get these loaves of Garlic Bread in a silver foil type wrapping. The logo was Green and Red. I for the life of me can't remember the name of the brand.

Now to the crux of the reason I am posting. I am trying to see if anyone remembers this particular kind of Garlic Bread because I have long since moved away and can not find it where I live and when people hear the chief ingredient I loved it for, they look at me crazy. I distinctly remember the Garlic Bread was a french or baguette style long loaf, and the garlic butter had dill in it. It was not parsley as Parsley has virtually no taste and this had a tanginess to it. 

I did a bit of research on the google and its apparently something that was common in Indiana and Kentucky around that time but has since fallen out of Vogue.

I guess it boils down to: Does anyone remember Garlic Bread like this, and if anyone knows the brand that sold that and could drop the name in the comments, that would be most radical. ",3,1763840842.0,NewAlbanyIN,2,1.0,False

I’m currently based in Bangalore, India,  navigating the exciting world of a Master's program in Psychology. When my head isn’t buried in textbooks or analyzing complex theories, I’m obsessed with challenging myself physically. I’m really into weightlifting and MMA, and generally just love pushing my limits. That feeling of accomplishment after a tough session is the best.

Beyond the gym, I’m a huge advocate for getting into nature. Travel is a priority, and my ideal escape involves throwing on a backpack and heading out for some hiking. I love my academic field, but I also enjoy delving into other areas like philosophy—I’ve found myself really connecting with the beautiful, chaotic honesty of Absurdism lately. When it’s time to wind down, you'll find me glued to a psychological thriller or a good horror movie—though I have a soft spot for those hilarious South Indian horror-comedy combos 😂💖. I also love RPG games, though finding the time to actually play them is a struggle!

On a personal note, I’ve had my own share of battles, including clinical anxiety and a deep sense of loneliness, stemming from a rough upbringing. I’m definitely a work in progress, but I try my best every single day to embrace life and love, navigating the chaos with a dose of dark humor—you know the vibe: ""Should I kill myself or drink a cup of coffee?"" 

I'm truly seeking a genuine connection with someone who values mutual respect and effective communication above all else. We don't have to be on the same page 100% of the time, but as long as there is care and respect, that's enough for me. If you’re in Bangalore, or open to chatting with a thoughtful human who lifts heavy things and ponders the meaninglessness of existence, send me a message! ｡⁠◕⁠‿⁠◕⁠｡

Take care! You're precious!

I recently got a new kitten (6mo female) and I have a resident cat/kitten (11mo male). Kitten is in the bedroom and cat is in the living room. I was roughly following the Jackson Galaxy video but they were doing so well I admittedly moved really fast. I think they're doing well? I'm just not sure if I should continue doing what I'm doing or slow down. I'm worried I might have pushed them too quickly. 

  
Day 1: 

* Kitten has been so affectionate! constantly purring and greeting us, making biscuits on us and laying with us. She's confidently exploring the bedroom. Cat has been doing well too. 
* They ate lunch on opposite sides of the door. No hissing or growling or anything. Both were very curious to open the door. 
* Next we site swapped and they did really well. 
* Peeked door open so they saw each other while eating/eating churus. No hissing or growling but they did know each other were there. 

Day 2: 

* Morning: Fed churus on opposite sides of a screen door. Sniffed each other. No growling or hissing. 
* More site swaps.  Kitten has been calm and has loved exploring the living room. 
* Evening: ate dinner through screen door. Cat became distracted and spent mealtime sniffing his sister through the screen door. Even sniffed noses. No hissing.
* **After dinner, we let them meet without the screen door.** Some hissing started from our cat but pretty lightly. They played together with some wand toys and ate treats really closely from my hand together. Cat is pretty locked in on her, following her around, and staring at her. But some hissing (like 2-4x) , no poofy tail etc. and he can redirect sometimes back to toys and treats. They also smelled each others noses multiple times. Our cat is still pretty jumpy while the kitten is confident but also showing some submissiveness by laying down in front of him. (30-40 minutes) 
* Only maybe concerning thing is that our cat can maybe annoy her. He starts creeping with ears back and she'll run under the coffee table and make a low growling sound. 

Day 3: 

* Ate breakfast without the screen door. Cat sniffed her the whole time and barely ate. He hissed a couple times. I let them play after. **Cat is still following her around and watching her. Sometimes he'll initiate some play? i think? ears back, creeping, and some swatting which sends her under the coffee table with low growls and some swatting too.** Now she's running away from him more often but she's not scared i think? and she'll still sniff him/eat treats next to him. After kitten is back to being affectionate in the room. 

  
Can anyone let me know what they think? My plan was continue to do supervised play 3x a day for around 30 minutes each time. 

Is there anything concerning about how they're interacting? Should I slow it down and give them more space? I don't want to stress my new kitten out or cat. Thank you! ",2,1763840620.0,CatAdvice,0,1.0,False

Looking for someone to connect with this winter.
Someone warm, genuine, and open to seeing where things go. Ideally, our connection becomes a relationship, because that’s ultimately what I’m looking for.

I can host, drive, or pick you up if you’re comfortable with that. I’d love to chat on here first, and if we vibe, meet for a coffee, dinner or even a fun little pool date.

A bit about me:
I recently opened a business, and between that and school I’m pretty driven and stay busy but would absolutely make time for the right person. I’ve also got a new dog I’m training myself but when I do get a free moment I enjoy gaming, building/crafting/working with my hands, playing piano, writing music, cooking, plants and gardening. In warmer weather I skateboard and play tennis, and this winter I’m hoping to finally try snowboarding. As of recent I’ve quit smoking weed and have no intentions of going back but wouldn’t mind some good conversation over a few drinks. 

You:
21+ who’s in or near Vaughan/GTA. You communicate well, enjoy good conversation, appreciate honesty, and don’t mind some playful banter. You’re comfortable with closeness and affection that isn’t overly sexual in the beginning, and you like the idea of letting things build naturally.
I’m open to any race or body type as I care far more about your personality, and the energy you bring than any specific look or shape.
Bonus points if you enjoy dogs, cozy nights, laughter, or just having someone steady and supportive around.

What I’m like:
I want something that flows naturally. The kind of connection where effort feels effortless. I’m the type of guy who checks in, listens attentively, and makes you laugh until your stomach feels like you just finished an ab workout. I’m honest. Sometimes brutally so.. because I’d rather tell the truth and deal with a moment of discomfort than lie and deal with the mess that comes after. Transparency and communication are very important to me. 

I’m patient, emotionally intelligent, and financially independent. I value constructive criticism and have thick skin.  I enjoy banter, especially when the teasing builds on itself and becomes something original to us.

As for affection:
I like to pamper and be pampered. Like hair play, head and back scratches, cuddles, kissing, making out — nothing overly sexual in the beginning. I just enjoy closeness, comfort, and warmth.

I’ve got a lot of affection and care to give, and I’m hoping to find someone who’s looking for the same.

But the cultivation of coffee itself does not originate from Yemen. It was brought to Yemen from the horn of Africa and through ignorance people believe the coffee drink was first made in Abyssinia and traded to Yemen. In this thread I will be disproving this Ethiopian claim as the first people to cultivate coffee and correct history, complete with sources and such. 

  
**YEMENI CLAIM TO COFFEE - Disproved** 

https://preview.redd.it/zipkporj2v2g1.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=05cc36fdec9934d82bebc8dbe6675e351f5d34cc

 

Yemenis claim that coffee was first discovered in Yemen by sufis and their Sheikh Ali however primary sources tell a different story, in fact the Yemeni sufis were simply introduced to the Coffee drink by Somalis and took it on as a part of their culture;  
  
***SULTAN SA'AD AL-DIN DRINKING COFFEE***  
""Later, coffee became an essential aspect of all dhikr gatherings. Its introduction is associated with a Shādhili called Abu 'l-Hasan 'Ali ibn 'Umar (d. at Mukhā in Yemen in A.D. 1418), who became acquainted with the beverage when he resided at the court of Sa'd ad-din II, sultan of Ifāt-Zaila' in southern Ethiopia. It was taken up by Yemeni and Hadrami Sufis and its subsequent diffusion throughout the Arab world under Sufi auspices was rapid."" 

https://preview.redd.it/42d7qoyl2v2g1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=40abbb3f8cb1af6bb0d1e5cd91faf952ebbb60fc

This source basically means that the spread of coffee across the Arab world, and eventually to the whole world, especially in the West, happened because the founder of the city of Mocha in Yemen, a Sheikh, discovered the drink at the court of the Somali Walashma Sultan Sa'ad al-Din. This introduction by Yemeni Hadrami Sufis is the reason for the spread of coffee throughout the world.  
  
Now that we have established that the reason for Coffee's spread from Yemen was because of the Yemeni sheikh who founded the city of Mocha was welcomed into the court of the Somali Sultan Sa'ad al-din and soon became acquainted with the drink, bringing it back with him to Yemen and quickly spread. 



**ETHIOPIAN CLAIM TO COFFEE - Disproved**  
  
There has been a recent push from Ethiopians to claim the coffee drink to be their invention, however this is false to the point that even with a great number of Ethiopian scholars trying to push this propaganda out to the world, this made up story is still all over the place and makes little sense so much so that most modern writers acknowledge that the coffee plant originates from the horn but attribute the Coffee drink with Yemen.  
  
First we will look at the invention of Coffee from the Ethiopian perspective: 

**The coffee plant originates in Kaffa Ethiopia**. According to legend, the 9th-century goat herder Kaldi in the region of Kaffa discovered the coffee plant after noticing the energizing effect the plant had on his flock, but the story did not appear in writing until 1671. 

[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8jEFDAAAQBAJ&redir\_esc=y](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8jEFDAAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y) 

The source says all that needs to be said, this is a mere legend and only appears in written sources nearly a millennium after the story supposedly takes place.  
  
Another reason which makes the Ethiopian claim to coffee laughable was the fact that the Ethiopian orthodox church had prohibited drinking coffee and saw it as the ""drink of the Muslims"" and by drinking coffee you are imitating the Muslims which in this case was the Somali kingdom of Awfat-Awdal. 

https://preview.redd.it/nbygv4gt2v2g1.png?width=1054&format=png&auto=webp&s=e183c1caaf57196f08c8fbc3982976c724c06a20

Then the question is, well if coffee doesn't originate from Kaffa, Ethiopia where does it come from? 

https://preview.redd.it/9ua113yw2v2g1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c6a5291aa63d2e3c1f3f835427fdca77c668960

While Ethiopia's claim that coffee originates in kaffa has no accurate primary sources and is based on oral tales and weak contemporary sources nearly a millennium after, Somalia has several credible medieval sources claiming it as the source of coffee including the renowned Egyptian scholar [Ibn Hajar al-Haytami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Hajar_al-Haytami)  
  
Here's the original Arabic source if you are interested; 

جاء في الفواكه العديدة في المسائل المفيدة  
للشيخ العلامة احمد بن محمد بن منقور النجدي رحمه الله تعالى نقلا عن المؤرخ ابن حجر الهيتمي المكي :  
  
فائدة في القهوة حدث قبيل هذا القرن العاشر شراب يتخذ من قشر البن ، نبت يجلب من نواحي زيلع باليمن يسمى ذالك قهوة وطال الاختلاف في حلها و طهارتها ... 

https://preview.redd.it/te93jjg23v2g1.png?width=903&format=png&auto=webp&s=d71c2271529d09e01213a3d808887749006113af

Adding to Ibn Hajar al-Haytami, there is also archaeological proof that coffee originates in the ""Zelia region""  
This source helps us further pinpoint the origin of coffee to the ancient town of [Abasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abasa,_Awdal)[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abasa,_Awdal)In Awdal.  
  
**SOMALIWEYN THE SOURCE OF COFFEE**  
  
The final nail in the coffee for these langaabs trying to hotep the invention of coffee is disproving the cope that Somalia can't grow coffee.  
The reason this is stupid is because Somalia already has fertile lands and has always done widescale agriculture in the south due to the two rivers, and we're talking about Somaliweyn here not just Somalia, we owned hararghe and bale with all it's fertile lands, and many Somali clans, who have not been assimilated by Oromo tribesmen coming from the deep south, to this day still farm there.  
  
But ignoring this desperate last pillar in the argument against Somali's claim to coffee, i will drop a some source about Somalia's coffee production; 

https://preview.redd.it/5axaogo53v2g1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=57751cd187b802be4def352ffcbf954fe570e0e6

Just Somaliland and the ""Somali coast"" together are only second place to Abyssinia, imagine how the chart would look if it accounted for the total production of the Somali peninsula? 

  
Coffee was invented in Abasa town in Awdal and was spread to Yemen after the Somali Sultan of Ifat, Sa'd ad-din I of Walashma, welcomed the Yemeni sufi Shiekh Ali into his court and accustomed him to the Somali drink of Coffee which was then brought back to Yemen and through trade reached the world.",6,1763840463.0,Somalia,4,1.0,False

1p42794,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p42794/the_ledger_part_2/,The Ledger (Part 2),"The Baalzephon collection took three weeks and ended with a payment plan that involved garnishing wages from a demon's investments in three different stock markets across two dimensions. After that came collections that made Baalzephon look simple.

Six months into the job, I stopped collecting from humans entirely.

Now I collected from things that shouldn't owe debts. Things that existed before debt was a concept. Things that had been gods when humanity was still learning to make fire.

A djinn who owed for services rendered during the Crusades. A minor deity of forgotten rivers who'd borrowed power and never returned it. A thing that lived in the spaces between mirrors and owed rent for occupying reflective surfaces across seventeen major cities. An angel—fallen or risen, I couldn't tell—who'd defaulted on a contract so old the paper had turned to dust and the terms existed only in Ashmedai's memory.

I collected from all of them.

And I survived.

I shouldn't have. By every law of probability and supernatural hierarchy, I should have died a dozen times over. The djinn should have burned me to ash. The river god should have drowned me in waters that existed in no physical space. The mirror-thing should have pulled me into the glass and left me trapped in reflection forever.

But I didn't die.

I learned. I adapted. I became very, very good at not dying.

And something inside me changed.

The insomnia came first. I'd lie in bed watching shadows move across my ceiling in patterns that spelled words in languages I didn't know but somehow understood. The words were contracts. Terms and conditions. Debts and payments. My ceiling had become a ledger, and I was reading it in my sleep.

When I did sleep, I dreamed in other people's memories. Other things' memories. I dreamed I was a creature of living flame negotiating with a merchant in ancient Babylon. I dreamed I was something with too many eyes watching the birth of the first ocean. I dreamed I was Ashmedai, young and human and desperate, signing a contract in blood that wasn't entirely his own.

I woke from these dreams with words on my tongue that tasted like copper and ozone and the moment before lightning strikes.

My apartment developed cold spots that moved. I'd be making coffee in the kitchen and walk through a pocket of air so cold my breath fogged, and then it would drift into the living room like it was following me. Searching for me. Learning me.

Things appeared in my peripheral vision. Not the shadows and monsters I'd learned to see through the veil—those were constant now, unavoidable, just part of how I perceived the world. These were different. These were things that existed in the corner of my eye and vanished when I turned to look. Shapes that were almost familiar. Faces that were almost mine.

My reflection started arriving late.

I'd look in the bathroom mirror and see the empty room behind me for a fraction of a second before my reflection appeared, stepping into frame like an actor who'd missed their cue. And when it did appear, it didn't always match my movements exactly. Sometimes it smiled when I didn't. Sometimes it moved its lips like it was speaking words I couldn't hear.

I stopped looking in mirrors when I could avoid it.

My hands changed. The skin grew tougher, less sensitive. I could touch hot pans without flinching, hold ice until it melted, press my palm against the blade of a knife and feel only distant pressure. I was becoming harder. Less breakable. Less human.

And I could see them now. All of them. All the time.

The woman on the subway whose shadow had wings. The man at the coffee shop whose reflection showed something with antlers and too many fingers. The child in the park who turned to look at me with eyes that were windows into somewhere else, somewhere vast and dark and full of watching things.

I saw the world as it really was. Layered. Thin. A membrane stretched over something much larger and much older and much hungrier than the human world pretended to be.

I mentioned it to Ashmedai once.

""You're developing the sight,"" he said, not looking up from his paperwork. ""It's natural. The more you collect from them, the more you become like them. The more you see what they see.""

""And the dreams? The cold spots? The reflection?""

""Side effects. Your consciousness is expanding. You're existing in multiple states simultaneously. The human part of you is still anchored to your body, but the rest—"" He gestured vaguely. ""The rest is learning to exist elsewhere.""

""I don't want to exist elsewhere. I want to exist here. In my body. As a human.""

He looked up then. His eyes were patient, ancient, and utterly without sympathy. ""Then you chose the wrong job.""

The collection that should have killed me came on a Tuesday.

The debtor's name was unpronounceable—the Ledger entry showed a symbol that hurt to look at, something that twisted in on itself like a Möbius strip made of angles that shouldn't exist. Ashmedai had written a phonetic approximation below it: ""Yth'naal.""

""What is it?"" I asked.

""Old,"" Ashmedai said. ""Older than most gods. Older than the concept of gods. It existed before worship, before belief, before humans had the cognitive capacity to imagine something greater than themselves.""

""What does it owe?""

""A favor. Rendered in 3200 BCE. Payment was deferred at the time, with interest accruing at standard rates.""

I calculated the interest on a debt that old. The number was astronomical. Literally—it was measured in stellar cycles and the lifespan of galaxies.

""What could something that old possibly give us as payment?""

""That's between it and me. Your job is to collect. To make contact, present the debt, and secure acknowledgment of payment terms.""

""Where is it?""

Ashmedai wrote an address. Not a street address. A set of coordinates. Latitude, longitude, and a third number I didn't recognize.

""What's the third coordinate?""

""Depth,"" he said. ""You'll need to go down.""

The coordinates led me to an abandoned subway station in the oldest part of the city. The entrance had been sealed decades ago, the stairs blocked with concrete and rebar. But someone—something—had broken through. The concrete was cracked, the rebar bent outward like it had been pushed from below.

I descended.

The stairs went down farther than they should have. Farther than the subway system extended. Farther than the bedrock. I counted steps until I lost count, until the numbers stopped meaning anything, until I realized I'd been walking down for an hour and the stairs showed no sign of ending.

The air changed as I descended. It grew thick, heavy, like breathing through wet cloth. It tasted old. Not stale—old. Like I was inhaling air that had been trapped since the formation of the earth, air that had never touched the surface, air that had existed in darkness so complete it had become a physical thing.

The stairs finally ended at a tunnel. Not a subway tunnel—this was older, rougher, carved from stone by something that didn't use tools. The walls were covered in marks that might have been writing or might have been the tracks of something dragging itself through the dark.

I had a flashlight. It barely penetrated the darkness. The beam seemed to stop after a few feet, absorbed by the air itself.

I walked.

The tunnel sloped downward. The marks on the walls grew more frequent, more frantic. They overlapped, layered on top of each other, like whatever made them had been trying to write the same message over and over, trying to get it right, trying to make itself understood.

I tried not to look at them too closely. When I did, they moved. Rearranged themselves. Spelled words in languages that predated language.

The tunnel opened into a chamber.

It was vast. My flashlight couldn't find the walls or ceiling. The darkness here was absolute, total, the kind of darkness that existed before light was invented. The kind of darkness that light was created to push back against.

And in that darkness, something breathed.

Not air moving in and out of lungs. This was deeper. Slower. The breathing of something so large that each breath took minutes. Each exhalation moved the air in the chamber like wind, carrying with it a smell that made my hindbrain scream.

It smelled like the bottom of the ocean. Like the space between stars. Like the moment before the universe began, when there was nothing but potential and hunger and the terrible patience of things that could wait forever.

""Yth'naal,"" I said. My voice was small, swallowed by the dark. ""I'm here about a debt.""

The breathing stopped.

For a moment, there was only silence. Perfect, complete, suffocating silence.

Then something moved in the darkness.

I couldn't see it. My flashlight showed nothing. But I could feel it moving, could sense the displacement of air, could hear the sound of something massive shifting position. Stone grinding. Water dripping. The wet sound of flesh sliding against itself.

And then it spoke.

It didn't use words. It didn't use sound. It spoke directly into my mind, bypassing my ears entirely, and the sensation was like having my skull opened and something poured directly into my brain.

*DEBT.*

The word carried weight. History. Meaning that went beyond definition. I understood, in that moment, what debt meant to something like this. Not money. Not obligation. Not even payment.

Debt was connection. Debt was relationship. Debt was the acknowledgment that something had been given and something was owed and that exchange created a bond that transcended time and space and the death of universes.

*I REMEMBER.*

Images flooded my mind. Not memories—I was experiencing something else's memories, seeing through eyes that weren't eyes, perceiving time in a way that made my human consciousness scream.

I saw the world when it was young. When the continents were different shapes. When things that would become gods were still learning what they were. When Ashmedai was—

The image cut off. Blocked. Like something had reached into my mind and closed a door.

*THE DEBT IS ACKNOWLEDGED.*

""Payment,"" I managed to say. My voice was shaking. My hands were shaking. Everything was shaking. ""Payment terms need to be established.""

*PAYMENT.*

The word was different this time. Heavier. Darker. It carried implications that made my stomach turn.

*WHAT DOES THE COLLECTOR OFFER?*

""I'm not offering anything. You owe—""

*ALL DEBTS ARE EXCHANGES. YOU COME TO COLLECT. WHAT DO YOU OFFER IN RETURN FOR PAYMENT?*

I didn't understand. That's not how debt collection worked. The debtor paid. The collector collected. There was no exchange, no offering, no—

And then I understood.

This thing was old enough that it existed before the concept of one-sided transactions. Before the idea that debt could be extracted without exchange. In its understanding of reality, everything was trade. Everything was balance. If it gave payment, it received something in return.

And it wanted to know what I was offering.

""Information,"" I said, thinking fast. ""I offer information about the current state of the world. About what's changed since you last walked the surface.""

*INSUFFICIENT.*

""Knowledge. I offer knowledge of—""

*INSUFFICIENT.*

""Then what do you want?""

The darkness moved closer. I could feel it pressing against me, surrounding me, seeping into my pores like water.

*I WANT TO SEE THROUGH YOUR EYES.*

""What?""

*YOU ARE YOUNG. NEW. YOU SEE THE WORLD AS IT IS NOW. I HAVE BEEN HERE TOO LONG. I HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT THE SURFACE LOOKS LIKE. WHAT LIGHT LOOKS LIKE. WHAT TIME LOOKS LIKE WHEN IT MOVES FORWARD INSTEAD OF CIRCLING.*

*LET ME SEE THROUGH YOUR EYES. LET ME REMEMBER WHAT IT IS TO MOVE THROUGH THE WORLD. AND I WILL PAY THE DEBT.*

Every instinct I had screamed no. Letting something like this into my head, into my perception, into my experience of reality—that was worse than death. That was contamination. That was losing myself in something so vast and old and alien that I'd never find my way back.

But I thought about the debt. About the astronomical number in the Ledger. About what Ashmedai would do if I came back empty-handed.

About the fact that I'd survived this long by being smart, by being adaptable, by being willing to do what needed to be done.

""How long?"" I asked.

*ONE DAY. ONE ROTATION OF YOUR WORLD. I WILL SEE THROUGH YOUR EYES, AND THEN I WILL WITHDRAW, AND THE DEBT WILL BE PAID.*

""You can't control me. You can't make me do anything. You just observe.""

*AGREED.*

""And after one day, you leave. Completely. No residue, no connection, no—""

*AGREED.*

I should have said no. Should have walked away. Should have told Ashmedai this debt was uncollectable.

But I didn't.

""Agreed,"" I said.

The darkness rushed into me.

It felt like drowning. Like being buried alive. Like having my skull filled with cold water and ancient stone and the weight of millennia. I felt Yth'naal pour into my consciousness, spreading through my neural pathways like ink in water, touching every memory, every thought, every sensation.

And then it settled. Became still. Became a presence in the back of my mind, watching through my eyes, experiencing my experience, remembering what it was to exist in time that moved forward.

I could feel its satisfaction. Its relief. Its terrible, patient joy.

*THE DEBT WILL BE PAID AT SUNSET TOMORROW. GO. SHOW ME THE WORLD.*

I walked back through the tunnel. Up the endless stairs. Out into the city.

And for the next twenty-four hours, I was not alone in my own head.

Yth'naal watched everything. The sunlight—it had forgotten sunlight, and feeling it through my skin made it shudder with something like pleasure. The people on the street—it studied their faces, their movements, their small human concerns with the fascination of an entomologist examining insects. The sky—it stared at the sky through my eyes for an hour, watching clouds move, watching birds fly, watching the blue expanse that it hadn't seen in thousands of years.

It didn't speak. Didn't interfere. Just watched.

But I could feel it. Feel its presence. Feel its thoughts brushing against mine like cobwebs. Feel its ancient, inhuman consciousness trying to understand the world through my limited, human perception.

I didn't sleep that night. Couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I felt Yth'naal pressing closer, curious about dreams, about the human unconscious, about what happened when awareness dimmed.

I kept my eyes open until sunrise.

At sunset the next day, exactly twenty-four hours after our agreement, Yth'naal withdrew.

It pulled out of my mind like a tide receding, leaving behind a residue of itself—memories that weren't mine, knowledge I shouldn't have, an understanding of time and space and existence that my human brain wasn't designed to contain.

And in my bank account, a deposit appeared. Not money. Something else. A credit in the Ledger, marked as payment received, worth more than any currency.

I went back to the office. Ashmedai was waiting.

""You let it into your head,"" he said. Not a question.

""It was the only way to collect.""

""That was dangerous. Stupid. You could have lost yourself completely.""

""But I didn't.""

He studied me for a long moment. ""No. You didn't. You're stronger than I thought. Or more foolish. I haven't decided which.""

""The debt is paid.""

""Yes. It is."" He made a note in the Ledger. ""You should rest. You look—"" He paused. ""Different.""

I did feel different. Like something inside me had been rearranged. Like Yth'naal's presence had changed the architecture of my consciousness, leaving rooms and corridors that hadn't been there before.

""I'm fine,"" I said.

""No,"" Ashmedai said. ""You're not. But you will be. Eventually. After you adjust.""

""Adjust to what?""

""To what you're becoming.""

He didn't elaborate.

I went home. Looked in the mirror.

My reflection looked back at me with eyes that were darker than they should be. Deeper. Like they went back farther than my skull should allow.

I looked away quickly.

The next day, Miriam Ashford called.

""You need to come see me,"" she said. ""Now. Ashmedai told me about the Yth'naal collection. You shouldn't have survived that. The fact that you did means something. Something important. Something we need to discuss.""

I drove to her house. She was waiting on the porch, her face grim.

""Come inside,"" she said. ""And take off your shoes. You're tracking something.""

I looked down. My shoes looked clean.

""Not dirt,"" she said. ""Essence. You've got something clinging to you. Something old. Take them off.""

I took off my shoes.

Inside, her house smelled like sage and old paper and ozone. She led me to a room I hadn't seen before—a study lined with books, the walls covered in symbols drawn in what looked like silver paint.

""Sit,"" she said, pointing to a chair inside a circle drawn on the floor.

I sat.

She sat across from me, outside the circle, and studied my face for a long moment.

""You let it in,"" she said. ""You let something that old, that powerful, into your consciousness. Do you have any idea what you've done?""

""I collected the debt. That's my job.""

""Your job is to survive. And you just did something that should have killed you or driven you insane or turned you into something that isn't human anymore."" She leaned forward. ""Why aren't you dead?""

""I don't know.""

""That's what we need to find out."" She stood, walked to a shelf, and pulled down a book. Old leather, no title, pages that looked like they'd been hand-written centuries ago. ""I've been researching. Ever since Ashmedai hired you, I've been researching. Because he doesn't hire normal people. He doesn't hire people who can just collect debts. He hires people who can survive collecting debts from things that should kill them.""

""What are you saying?""

""I'm saying there's something about you. Something that makes you resistant to contamination. Something that lets you touch the divine and the demonic and the ancient without being destroyed by it."" She opened the book, turned pages covered in dense text and diagrams. ""I think you're a conduit.""

""A what?""

""A conduit. A person who can channel power without being consumed by it. It's rare. Very rare. Most people who try to interact with entities like Yth'naal are destroyed—their consciousness is overwhelmed, their body burns out, their soul is shredded. But conduits can hold that power. Temporarily. They can let it flow through them without being destroyed.""

""I've never heard of that.""

""Most people haven't. Because most conduits don't survive long enough to be documented. They're found by things like Ashmedai, used until they burn out, and then discarded."" She looked at me with something that might have been pity. ""You're not his employee. You're his tool. And he's using you to collect debts from entities that no normal person could approach.""

I thought about the collections. About the djinn, the river god, the mirror-thing, the angel. About how I'd survived encounters that should have killed me.

About how Ashmedai had known I would survive.

""If I'm a conduit,"" I said slowly, ""what happens when I burn out?""

""You die. Or worse—you become a hollow. A shell. Something that looks human but isn't anymore. Something that exists only to channel power for whoever owns you.""

""Ashmedai doesn't own me.""

""Doesn't he?"" She closed the book. ""You signed a contract. You work for him. You collect debts that benefit him. You're changing, becoming less human, more like the things you collect from. How is that different from ownership?""

I didn't have an answer.

""That's why I'm going to teach you,"" Miriam said. ""Not just protection magic. Not just how to survive. I'm going to teach you how to stay yourself. How to maintain your humanity even when you're channeling things that are fundamentally inhuman. How to be a conduit without becoming a hollow.""

""Can that be done?""

""I don't know. But we're going to try.""

In today’s fast-paced world, the push to constantly achieve can leave us feeling joyless and drained. If you find yourself battling burnout or feeling like life has become a never-ending race, you’re not alone. As high achievers, we are often wired to strive and achieve, but it’s important to remember that joy is found in the journey, not just in the destination.

**Here are some mindful strategies to help you relearn joy and embrace the art of slowing down:**

1. **Create Mindful Moments:** Set aside ten minutes each day to breathe deeply and focus on the present. Whether it’s sipping your morning coffee in silence or taking a brisk walk without your phone, these mindful moments can anchor your day and cultivate a sense of calm.

2. **Redefine Productivity:** Understand that slowing down can actually enhance productivity. Instead of pushing through fatigue, allow yourself time to recover. Research shows that taking breaks can boost creativity and focus. Remember, sometimes you have to slow down to speed up.

3. **Embrace Stillness:** Silence your internal critic who insists you should always be doing more. Instead, find contentment in just being. Meditation, yoga, or even sitting in nature can help you embrace stillness, providing a much-needed break from the hustle.

4. **Find Joy in Routine:** Transform mundane tasks into joyful rituals. Whether it’s prepping meals with mindfulness or turning your cleaning routine into a dance party, infuse joy into daily chores to shift your mindset from obligation to enjoyment.

5. **Reflect on Your Values:** Take time to assess what truly brings you joy. Write down your values and align your daily activities with them. This process can clarify your goals and remind you that life is about more than just achievement.

6. **Practice Gratitude:** Regularly jot down things you’re grateful for. This simple act shifts your focus from what you lack to what you possess, fostering joy in the present moment. 

By consciously choosing to slow down, you’ll find pathways to joy—especially after overcoming the relentless cycle of striving.

Remember, relearning joy is a journey, not a race. Embrace it.

So my girlfriend and I have been doing long distance for a few months; I had to move for work and it was only a temporary relocation. Prior to long distance we were dating for about a year. I love her and long distance has been difficult but in many ways, but it has also made our relationship stronger. I am, however, starting to feel like I am being replaced by her long time friend (let’s just call him Peter).

My girlfriend and Peter have been friends throughout high school and college. One activity my girlfriend and I bonded over early on in our relationship was lifting. We’re both active people and loved weightlifting - generally just getting stronger and healthier. After going long distance she stepped back from the gym a bit, mostly because she didn’t consider it as fun without me. That was sweet to hear; I stayed consistent but also really missed working out with her. I did encourage her to get back in it though because I know how much she loved it.

Recently, her and Peter have been lifting together a lot (roughly twice a week). Peter and I are oddly similar in a lot of ways, both in looks and personality, and this is something people that know both of us well have pointed out. I’m happy that she’s been able to find the fun in it again, but a part of me can’t help but feel jealous and also scared that this is with, and partly thanks to, Peter.

More than once it’s happened where she has said something along the lines of “had a chill one today, we ended up just talking the whole time.” Or they have last minute cancelled their lifts into just hanging out, grabbing a coffee/etc. To be clear, this rarely happened when it was just us two, as I typically go into a workout with a mission. When we would lift we would also frequently hit up a Mediterranean spot across the street after that we both loved. It became a sort of personal ritual for us. She has also started doing that with Peter, which hurts.

Her siblings have pointed out to her that they think Peter likes her by the way he looks at her. She disagrees, naturally, and says they’ve just been friends forever. I personally didn’t see it either, but her and Peter’s dates (for lack of a better word) as of late have started making me feel otherwise. I’m starting to feel like I’m being replaced, and it’s scary. To be clear, he’s a great guy and we’re also friendly. But our own similarities and the way my girlfriend and Peter are doing things we used to do together is scaring me.

I don’t want to tell her not to see him. They are old friends. But this is also eating away at me. I want to bring this up but I also don’t want to be overbearing or misinterpret the situation. What’s the best way to bring this up?",2,1763839914.0,relationships,3,1.0,False

**A/N:**  
Well.  
We finally hit *that* part of the story.

John’s immortality isn’t a theory anymore — it’s officially on record. Perseus walked in, spilled enough historical tea to drown a pantheon, and casually confirmed that Alex’s roommate is a multi-millennial identity thief with a résumé that includes “Alexander the Great,” “Viking menace,” and “Washington’s favorite spy.”

From here on out, things get… significantly bigger.  
Mythology, gods, ancient feuds, immortal politics, all the stuff John has been deflecting with tacos?  
Yeah. We’re stepping into that arc now.

If you enjoyed this reveal — or if you just want to yell with me about how casually Perseus dropped 3,400 years of family drama — let me know in the comments. I genuinely love reading your theories, reactions, and emotional breakdowns.

Now buckle up. Because Alex has no idea what's coming next…

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alex was sitting across from Perseus—the actual, literal, mythological Perseus who slayed Medusa and married Andromeda—in their dumpy Brooklyn apartment, and his roommate John had just fled the scene like a war criminal avoiding an international tribunal. 

This was it. The moment Alex had been building toward for months. 78 spreadsheet entries, countless deflections, and enough tacos to feed a Macedonian army had led to this: a demigod who actually knew the truth and seemed perfectly willing to spill it. 

Perseus lounged on the couch like a Greek statue that had decided to take a coffee break, munching Merlin's enchanted cookies with the casual ease of someone who'd been alive since Bronze Age and had seen it all. His gorgon medallion glinted in the afternoon light, and Excalibur—the ""prop"" sword—leaned against the couch like it was happy to finally be in the presence of another legendary hero. 

Alex's laptop was open, his spreadsheet glowing on the screen like a sacred text. His phone was recording (Sarah's orders). And his hands were shaking with a mixture of vindication, terror, and the kind of manic energy that comes from being gaslit by an immortal for four months straight. 

""Okay,"" Alex said, his voice hoarse but determined. ""Your dad just ran away rather than answer questions. You said he's immortal. You said he was Alexander the Great. You said you're over 3,000 years old and Merlin is your mom. I need you to explain everything. And I mean everything. No deflections. No tacos. Just truth."" 

Perseus grinned, that same maddening John-esque grin but with a heroic edge that suggested he'd actually follow through. ""Oh, man, you're so ready for this. Alright, buckle up, mortal. You're about to get the full story. And yeah, it's gonna make that spreadsheet of yours look like a kindergarten craft project."" 

He cracked his knuckles, grabbed another cookie, and leaned forward like a bard about to tell the greatest epic ever written. 

""First things first: Yeah, Dad's immortal. Like, really immortal. Been around since—honestly, I don't even know how long. He doesn't count anymore. Bronze Age at minimum, probably older. Maybe even older than the Primordials started getting organized, but that's his story to tell."" 

Alex's hands flew across his keyboard, updating the spreadsheet in real-time. 

*Sheet: ""Evidence of Immortality""*   
New entry: PERSEUS (JOHN'S SON) CONFIRMS: John is immortal, Bronze Age minimum, possibly older. Doesn't count his age anymore. FULL CONFIRMATION FROM PRIMARY SOURCE. 

# The Alexander Revelation 

""And yeah,"" Perseus continued, his grin widening, ""Dad was Alexander the Great. You caught that slip during the documentary, right? Classic Dad move. He gets too into critiquing his old work—like a director watching their own movie and yelling at the screen about continuity errors."" 

""OLD WORK?!"" Alex's voice cracked. ""He CONQUERED THE KNOWN WORLD and he calls it OLD WORK?!"" 

Perseus laughed, a sound that could've rattled the foundations of Olympus. ""Dude, when you've lived as long as Dad, everything's 'old work.' But yeah, the Alexander thing—356 to 323 BCE, he did the whole Macedonian prince bit. Except here's the thing: he wasn't born as Alexander."" 

Alex's fingers froze over his keyboard. ""What?"" 

""Dad's way older than Alexander,"" Perseus explained, grabbing his beer. ""He just showed up in Macedon one day and took over the identity. The real Alexander—Philip's biological son—died as a baby. Fever, I think. Sad, but it happens. Dad stepped in, lived the life. Tutored by Aristotle, commanded armies, conquered Persia, cried over his dead horse Bucephalus—full method acting. Then, when the empire started falling apart and the generals were squabbling like children, he faked his death in Babylon. Malaria cover story. Very dramatic. Mom—Merlin—helped with the staging."" 

Alex stared, his brain attempting to process that John hadn't been reincarnated as Alexander the Great but had identity-swapped into the role like some kind of cosmic understudy. 

""So he just... stole a dead baby's identity?"" Alex's voice was hollow. 

Perseus winced. ""Okay, 'stole' sounds harsh. The kid was already gone. Dad just filled the vacancy. And hey, he did a bang-up job! Conquered half the known world, spread Greek culture, made the name 'Alexander' legendary. Historians love him. You're welcome, by the way."" 

""I'm not thanking you for my roommate being a historical identity thief!"" 

Perseus snorted. ""Fair. But yeah, Dad's been doing that for millennia—picks an identity, commits fully, lives a whole life, fakes a death, moves on. Alexander's just the most famous one. Before that, he was some Sumerian warlord. After Alexander, he became a Roman senator—'Marcus,' I think. Advised Julius Caesar. Guy didn't listen, got stabbed. Dad said, 'I told you so,' and moved to Gaul."" 

*Sheet: ""Evidence of Immortality""*   
New entry: Alexander the Great was a ROLE John played (356-323 BCE). Real Alexander (Philip's son) died as baby. John took over identity, lived as Macedonian prince, conquered Persia, faked death in Babylon with Merlin's help. Before: Sumerian warlord. After: Roman senator ""Marcus,"" advised Julius Caesar. 

# The Merlin Bombshell 

""And your mom,"" Alex said, his voice shaking. ""Merlin. She's... what, exactly?"" 

Perseus's expression softened, the way it does when someone talks about family they genuinely love. ""Mom's the best. She's been around as long as Dad—probably longer, honestly. She's an ancient sorceress, way older than the Arthurian legends. 'Merlin' is just a name she picked up during the Camelot gig in the 5th or 6th century CE. Before that, she went by other names—Circe, Medea, pick your Greek or Celtic sorceress. Same person, different brands."" 

Alex's jaw was on the floor. ""So Merlin the wizard from King Arthur... is your mom... who's been alive since ancient Greece... and she's married to John?"" 

""Yup!"" Perseus said cheerfully. ""Mom and Dad met way back—I wanna say around 2000 BCE, give or take a few centuries. She was doing her magic thing in the Aegean, turning sailors into pigs, the usual. Dad was running around as some warlord-advisor type. They hit it off. Been together ever since, though they've had their off-and-on phases. Immortal relationships are complicated—you need space when you've got eternity."" 

He grinned. ""They had me around 1400 BCE. I'm the oldest kid, as far as I know. Dad's got a few other offspring scattered through history, but I'm the golden child."" He winked. 

Alex's brain was melting. ""So you're... over 3,400 years old. And John and Merlin have been married for over 4,000 years."" 

""More or less,"" Perseus confirmed. ""They don't really count anniversaries anymore. Too many zeroes. But yeah, they're disgustingly in love. You should see them at family dinners—still making heart-eyes at each other after four millennia. It's adorable and nauseating."" 

*Sheet: ""Evidence of Immortality""*   
New entry: MERLIN (John's wife) is ancient sorceress, older than Arthurian legends. ""Merlin"" is 5th-6th century CE identity. Previously: Circe, Medea, Morgan le Fay (Greek/Celtic sorceress names). Met John \~2000 BCE. Married 4000+ years. Had Perseus \~1400 BCE. John has other offspring ""scattered through history."" 

# The Historical Identity Parade 

""Okay,"" Alex said, his voice barely a whisper. ""So John's been... lots of people. Not just Alexander."" 

""Oh, tons,"" Perseus said, clearly enjoying this. ""Dad's a serial identity-switcher. He commits fully—lives the whole life, builds the legend, then bails when it gets boring or complicated. Let's see..."" He counted on his fingers. 

""Before Alexander: Sumerian warlord, helped Gilgamesh with his immortality quest—ironic, right? Egyptian vizier, advised a pharaoh or two. Got bored with the bureaucracy. 

""After Alexander: Roman senator 'Marcus,' like I said. Then he disappeared for a bit, resurfaced as a Viking raider in the 800s CE. Raided England, drank mead, grew a sick beard. Mom hated the beard. 

""Then Crusades—we don't talk about that phase. Messy. Lots of regrets. 

""Renaissance: funded da Vinci's workshop, might've helped with some sketches. Mom says he's taking too much credit, but Dad insists he suggested the flying machine. 

""American Revolution: one of Washington's spies. Probably why we won—Dad's good at espionage. 

""Wild West: ran a saloon in the 1880s. Bar fights every night. He loved it. 

""World Wars: you saw the papers. He did both, different ranks, different units. Advised Eisenhower, pissed off Patton. Standard stuff."" 

Alex was typing furiously, his spreadsheet exploding with new entries. 

*Sheet: ""Evidence of Immortality""*   
New entry: JOHN'S HISTORICAL IDENTITIES (per Perseus): Sumerian warlord (helped Gilgamesh), Egyptian vizier, Alexander the Great (356-323 BCE), Roman senator ""Marcus"" (advised Caesar), Viking raider (800s CE), Crusader (regrets), Renaissance patron (funded da Vinci), American Revolution spy (Washington's network), Wild West saloon owner (1880s), WWI & WWII soldier (multiple identities). 

""So he's just been... everyone?"" Alex said, his voice cracking. 

""Not everyone,"" Perseus corrected. ""Just the interesting ones. Dad gets bored easy—needs a new challenge every century or so. Picks a role, plays it, moves on. Rinse, repeat. He's like a method actor with infinite time and resources."" 

# The Mythological Deep Dive 

""Okay, but..."" Alex's brain was struggling. ""Lucifer. The Grim Reaper. They visited. How does that fit?"" 

Perseus grinned. ""Oh, you met Luce and Morton? Yeah, they're Dad's buddies. Lucifer's been friends with Dad since—I dunno, ancient Mesopotamia? They bonded over rebellion and whiskey. Morton—Death—is more of a work acquaintance. Dad's dodged him for so long they've developed a mutual respect. They have tea like twice a century, catch up on who's died, who's still kicking. It's weirdly wholesome."" 

""WHOLESOME?!"" Alex wanted to scream. ""The DEVIL and DEATH are your dad's DRINKING BUDDIES?!"" 

""I mean, yeah,"" Perseus said, like this was obvious. ""When you're immortal, you hang out with other immortals. Mortals age and die—it's sad. So Dad's got a crew: Lucifer, Morton, some gods here and there. Loki's fun at parties. Odin's a grump. Zeus is a tool, but he throws good banquets."" 

Alex's hands were shaking. ""Gods. Actual gods."" 

""Oh, yeah,"" Perseus said casually. ""All the pantheons are real—Greek, Norse, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, even the Abrahamic one, though they're more mysterious. Dad's met most of them. Partied with Dionysus—outdrank him, actually. Flirted with Athena until Mom chased him with a lightning bolt. Stole Thor's hammer during Ragnarok as a prank. Helped Hades streamline the Underworld's soul-sorting system. He's a cosmic networker."" 

*Sheet: ""Evidence of Immortality""*   
New entry: PANTHEON CONFIRMED REAL (per Perseus): Greek, Norse, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Abrahamic. John's friends: Lucifer (since Mesopotamia), Morton/Death (tea twice a century), Loki (party buddy), Odin (grumpy), Zeus (tool). John outdrank Dionysus, flirted with Athena (Merlin intervened), stole Thor's hammer (Ragnarok prank), helped Hades with Underworld logistics. 

# The ""Why Brooklyn?"" Question 

""But why HERE?"" Alex gestured at the peeling wallpaper, the leaky faucet, the thrift-store couch. ""Your dad's richer than God—literally, apparently. He owns islands, vaults, a $250 million ruby. Why live in this dump?"" 

Perseus laughed. ""That's pure Dad. He's got palaces, penthouses, estates all over. But he says they're boring. Too isolated. This place—"" he gestured around, ""—it's got 'soul.' Keeps him connected to regular people. Mortals like you remind him why humanity's worth sticking around for. Plus, he thinks it's hilarious watching roommates freak out when Lucifer shows up."" 

""I'M NOT A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT!"" 

""You kinda are, though,"" Perseus said, grinning. ""But hey, you're Dad's favorite. Most roommates bolt after a month. You've lasted—what, four months? And met me, Mom, Luce, Morton. That's impressive. Dad's genuinely fond of you."" 

Alex wanted to feel flattered, but he was too busy processing that he'd been John's cosmic pet project. 

# The Vindication 

""So,"" Alex said, his voice hoarse, ""to be clear: John is immortal. Has been alive for thousands of years. Was Alexander the Great. Married to Merlin for 4,000 years. You're his 3,400-year-old demigod son. All myths are real. And he's been gaslighting me with tacos for four months because he thought it was funny."" 

Perseus clapped, grinning. ""Yup! You got it! See, you're smart. That's why Dad likes you."" 

Alex buried his face in his hands. ""I was RIGHT. I was right about EVERYTHING."" 

""You were,"" Perseus confirmed. ""And honestly, most mortals don't get this far. The last roommate who figured it out—Tom, I think?—had a full breakdown, ended up in a psych ward. But you? You made a spreadsheet. That's proactive. Dad respects that."" 

Alex looked up, his eyes wild. ""I'm not crazy. I'm NOT crazy."" 

""Definitely not crazy,"" Perseus agreed. ""Just living with an immortal trickster who happens to be one of history's greatest conquerors and also my dad. Totally normal."" 

Alex grabbed his phone, hands shaking, and texted Sarah: ""PERSEUS CONFIRMED EVERYTHING. JOHN IS IMMORTAL, WAS ALEXANDER, MARRIED TO MERLIN 4000 YEARS, FRIENDS WITH LUCIFER AND DEATH. I WAS RIGHT. I WAS RIGHT. I WAS RIGHT."" 

Sarah's reply was a single word: ""PULITZER."" 

Alex laughed—manic, relieved, exhausted. He'd been vindicated. After 78 spreadsheet entries, countless deflections, and enough tacos to colonize Mars, he finally had the truth. 

John was immortal. Was Alexander the Great. And Alex, the data analyst from Brooklyn, had figured it out. 

He closed his laptop, looked at Perseus, and said, ""Your dad's an asshole."" 

Perseus laughed, clinking his beer against Alex's. ""Yeah, but he's our asshole. Welcome to the family, roommate."" ",1,1763839752.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

I just looked at the picture of him and her, a beautiful ring on her finger, and them standing together. They looked beautiful together.
He was marrying a beautiful woman—a woman that he had been seeing behind my back. 
Or I was the one he had been seeing behind her back. I didn't know.
I almost didn't want to know.
Then I received a text message from him with two words.
'I'm sorry.'
I drop the phone. My chest tightens—like someone’s squeezing my heart dry.
“Liar,” I whisper, voice cracking.
I'd packed my things and left Italy before dawn. 
No goodbye, no note. Just silence. Because if I'd seen him one more time, I might've stayed.
He didn't know where I was. He'd never known I was pregnant.
 I'll be leaving with the unborn child growing inside of me.
————————
The night he lost her, Rome burned in silence.
Luca Moretti stood in the middle of the storm he'd created - the city lights smudged by rain, his knuckles raw and stained with someone else's blood. The world had gone quiet except for the echo of her name in his head.
Amari.
He'd built empires, ended dynasties, made men kneel at his feet - but not even all his power could stop him losing the love of his life. He'd told himself it was for the best, that love was a weakness, that family was a liability in his world. But the truth? The truth was she took more than her footsteps when she left.
She took his peace.
And somewhere, deep in the shadows of the city, she took something else - something he didn't even know existed.
Their son.

Amari
The morning sunlight spilled through the kitchen window, soft and golden, catching in the curls of my son's hair as he leaned over his cereal bowl. His laughter filled the air - that deep, belly-deep laugh that always made my chest ache in the best and worst ways.
""Mom, can I go to Jason's after school? He got the new soccer game.""
I smiled as I buttered his toast, trying not to let the warmth in my chest twist. ""If you finish your homework first. No arguing.""
""I never argue.""
I gave him a look, one brow raised, and he grinned - that same crooked grin that had haunted me for ten years.
I turned back to the stove before the ache could show on my face. It was the smallest things that undid me. A flash of green in his hazel eyes when the sun hit them. The sharp line of his jaw when he was being stubborn. Luca's blood ran in him whether I wanted it to or not.
And every day, I prayed no one would ever notice.
Behind me, Marcus came down the hall, already dressed for work, tie perfectly straight, cufflinks glinting in the light. He pressed a peck to my cheek before grabbing his coffee. ""You two are up early,"" he said, his voice warm and calm - the kind of voice that made people trust him instantly.
Marcus wasn't Luca. He never would be. He was steady where Luca had been fire. Predictable where Luca had been chaos. The kind of man who folded his shirts perfectly, who said I love you without needing to prove it with grand gestures or destruction.
And still, sometimes, my heart ached in ways I couldn't explain.
""Big day today?"" I asked, leaning against the counter as he scrolled through his phone.
He smiled. ""Just meetings. The usual. I should be home by six. Maybe we can finally have that family night I've been promising?""
""Movie night?"" our son asked immediately, eyes lighting up.
""Movie night,"" Marcus confirmed, ruffling his hair before heading out the door.
When the door clicked shut, the house fell into a quiet rhythm again - the hum of the refrigerator, the clink of dishes, the soft whistle of the kettle. It was a peace I'd built carefully, piece by piece, out of the ashes of who I'd been.
After Luca, I promised myself I'd never need a man again. And for a long time, I didn't.
Until Marcus came along.
He didn't try to fix me. He just... stayed. Patiently. Even when I kept part of myself locked away. Even when I flinched at the word love.
He married me anyway. He loved my son as if he were his own. And maybe that's what I needed - a man who could love what another left behind.
By the time I dropped my son off at school, the world had shifted fully into day. Cars honked, kids ran across the crosswalk, parents waved hurried goodbyes. I lingered, watching him disappear into the crowd, his backpack bouncing against his shoulders.
A piece of my heart always went with him.
That fear - the kind only mothers knew - never really faded. Especially when your child's existence was a secret you'd spent a decade guarding.
I drove to work with the radio low, my thoughts louder than the music. I worked as a graphic designer now for a small marketing firm in downtown Los Angeles. The hours were steady, the people kind. Ordinary.
Exactly what I'd wanted.
Still, sometimes, I caught myself glancing at men in suits with foreign accents or dark hair slicked back too neatly - heart stuttering with a fear that made no sense. Luca didn't know where I was. He'd never known I was pregnant.
I'd made sure of that.
The day he told me he was marrying someone else, I'd packed my things and left Italy before dawn. No goodbye, no note. Just silence. Because if I'd seen him one more time, I might've stayed.
And if I'd stayed, my son would've been born into blood.

Luca
The first thing they taught me in my family was that emotion is a liability.
The second thing - that love is weakness.
I believed both. Until Amari.
And when she left, I understood something even more brutal: weakness doesn't always come from what you feel. Sometimes, it comes from what you lose.
It had been ten years, and still, I could taste the echo of her name.
The scent of her perfume. The warmth of her skin. The way she looked at me like I was a man, not a weapon wearing a suit.
I told myself I'd moved on. Married. Built the empire my father demanded I inherit. But at night, when the house was quiet and Rome's streets hummed below my penthouse, I still reached for her ghost in the dark.
Now, I ruled everything I'd once feared - the Moretti name, the ports, the men who bent their heads when I walked past. 
And yet, for all my power, I'd never felt more hollow.
""Boss,"" Matteo's voice cut through my thoughts, bringing me back to the present. My cousin leaned against the doorway, the only man in my circle I trusted completely. ""Meeting's in five. The Russians are waiting.""
I nodded, buttoning my jacket. ""Let them wait.""
Matteo smirked. ""You've changed. You used to hate keeping anyone waiting.""
""I used to care,"" I said simply, grabbing my watch.
He studied me for a moment. ""You ever wonder what would've happened if you'd gone after her?""
I froze. Matteo never said her name. None of them did.
""Careful,"" I warned quietly.
He lifted his hands. ""Just asking. You were different back then. Happier.""
Happier. The word tasted foreign. ""Happiness doesn't build empires.""
He sighed, muttering something under his breath, and followed me out.
The meeting was routine - men with too much pride and too little patience. Threats disguised as negotiations. I spoke little, letting my silence do the work. Power isn't loud. It's the pause before you answer, the way the air shifts when everyone realizes you don't need their permission to destroy them.
By the time the room cleared, my phone buzzed. Elena.
My wife.
I stared at the screen a moment before answering.
""Luca,"" she said in that polished tone she used for appearances, ""you missed lunch.""
""I had business.""
""You always have business.""
I didn't respond.
There was a pause, then her voice softened. ""My father wants us in Milan next week. For the charity gala.""
""Of course he does.""
""Will you come?""
""I'll try.""
Another pause. She knew what that meant - that I wouldn't. That I'd send flowers and an apology instead.
She sighed. ""Sometimes I wonder if you even see me anymore.""
I did. I saw her perfectly - the elegant mask, the practiced smile, the woman who married me not for love but for power. We both got what we wanted. At least, that's what I told myself.
""I'll call you later,"" I said, ending the call before she could answer.
The silence afterward pressed heavy against my chest.
Marriage had been my father's demand, not my choice. A merger disguised as matrimony. Elena was from a family of bankers, her bloodline clean enough to strengthen ours but secretly they had more power than people knew. It was supposed to make me legitimate - the perfect heir to the Moretti legacy.
And for the most part, it worked.
Except at night, when I dreamed in English.
When I saw brown eyes filled with defiance and love all at once. When I remembered the feel of rain in Florence the night she told me she loved me, and I couldn't say it back because my father was watching from a world away.
I'd told myself she'd be safer without me. That leaving her was mercy.
But mercy didn't feel like this. It felt like bleeding slow.
I stopped in front of a small art gallery - closed for the night. The same one I'd once taken Amari to. She'd loved that place. She'd stood there for an hour staring at a painting of a mother and child.
""It's not finished,"" she'd said, and I'd asked why.
""Because the eyes,"" she'd whispered, ""look like they're waiting for someone who'll never come back.""
Back then, I hadn't understood what she meant.
Now, I did.
I parked and walked to the glass window, staring at that same painting still hanging there, untouched, unsold. A decade of dust clinging to its frame.
""Ten years,"" I murmured. ""And I still can't let you go.""
Maybe Matteo was right. Maybe I should've gone after her. But how do you chase someone when your name alone could destroy them?
The Moretti bloodline didn't allow mistakes. And loving Amari had been my biggest one.
When I returned home, the city lights spilled across my office floor like shards of gold. I poured a glass of whiskey and leaned against the window, watching Rome breathe below.
Everything I had - the empire, the money, the power - had cost me her.
And still, I'd trade it all to hear her laugh again.
Sometimes I wondered if Amari ever thought of me.
If she'd built a new life somewhere far away, free from the ghosts of my name.
Maybe she had.
Maybe that was enough.
But as I finished my drink and looked out over the city I owned, something deep in my chest shifted - that same unexplainable pull I'd ignored for years.
Like the universe was whispering that the past wasn't finished with me yet.
And for the first time in a decade, I wasn't sure I wanted it to be.

Amari
I froze when I opened my phone.
It wasn't just a message. It wasn't just a notification.
It was a photo.
And it was my son.
Not in his backpack, not on the playground, not in some candid, innocent snapshot - but front and center, smiling with his friends at school, his name tagged under the picture.
I dropped my coffee mug. The ceramic clattered against the counter, shattering into pieces. My heart lurched, a jagged stab of panic I hadn't felt in years.
I had signed every form the school had offered. I had requested, no, demanded, that no photos of him be posted anywhere online. I had stressed, circled, initialed every box that allowed us to keep our life private. Every. Single. One.
And yet here it was.
Tagged. Posted. Public.
The image wasn't viral. Not yet. But one glimpse was all it took. One careless click, one teacher's innocent idea of ""community sharing,"" and suddenly, my son was visible to the world.
The first thought that hit me was irrational. Impossible. But I couldn't stop it: Did someone see this?
My hands shook as I scrolled through my phone, checking the school's page, their social media accounts, and the notifications I'd missed. There it was - his face, unmistakable, framed by the bright sunlight of a fall morning.
I should have felt relief that he looked happy. That he looked safe.
I didn't.
I couldn't.
Instead, adrenaline pumped through my veins, hot and bitter. My chest tightened. My thoughts raced back to Italy, to the nights I had lain awake worrying about shadows that moved too quickly, about men who watched too closely. I had promised myself - promised him - that he would never, ever, feel that kind of danger.
And now someone - maybe anyone - could see him.
I cursed under my breath. This wasn't supposed to happen. This wasn't supposed to be our life.
I shut the laptop abruptly and paced the kitchen, the soft hum of the refrigerator doing nothing to calm my racing heart. My mind spun with every scenario - every possibility. What if someone from the wrong part of my past - someone who had known me, known my son's father, known everything - stumbled upon this?
My chest tightened. My breaths came shallow. I ran my hands through my hair, tugging at it as if the motion could pull the fear from my body.
I couldn't call Marcus. Not yet. I didn't want to alarm him without knowing if this was actually dangerous. 
So I did what I always did when the world felt out of control. I became methodical.
First, the photo. Downloaded, backed up, and then a flurry of emails. I contacted the school administration, citing our privacy request, my voice rising as I typed the words over and over. ""This is unacceptable. Immediate removal required. Any copies reposted online must be deleted. My son's safety depends on this. Immediate compliance.""
I pressed ""send"" with trembling fingers. Then, I started combing the internet. Using every tool I knew, I traced every share, every mention of his name, every instance of that image. Deleted where I could. Flagged where I couldn't. My computer screen became a battlefield. 
After two hours, I slumped back in my chair, sweat cooling on my forehead. My heart still thundered, my mind still raced. Every face I saw on the street, every car that slowed past our driveway - I imagined them seeing him. Knowing him. Recognizing him.
I closed my eyes and breathed, trying to calm the spiraling thoughts. But I knew it wasn't just the photo that had shaken me. It was the reminder that the past wasn't as far away as I liked to believe. That someone, somewhere, could follow a trail - a trail I had spent ten years burying.
And then I felt it - that familiar prickle of unease that came with memory. The one that had kept me vigilant in Italy, the one that had never fully left me even when I built this quiet, ordinary life.
I remembered him.
Luca.
The green eyes. The laughter that had undone me. The man who had left a wound so deep I didn't even know I was still bleeding.
For a moment, I didn't breathe. My fingers went still over the keyboard. No. Don't think about him. He's gone.
But the panic, the fear that had flooded my chest, whispered otherwise. What if someone like him - someone with power, with resources, with a way of finding anything or anyone - saw this picture?",1,1763839392.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1p41rev,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1p41rev/the_dark_truth_about_doomscrolling_your_brains/,The dark truth about doomscrolling — your brain's being farmed,"Ever catch yourself scrolling through TikTok or Reddit for “just 5 minutes,” only to realize it’s suddenly 2 hours later and your mood has tanked? Yeah, same. Doomscrolling isn’t just a bad habit anymore. It’s become a silent epidemic — one that’s messing with our focus, sleep, and even sense of reality. Most people don’t realize what's really going on: you're not just scrolling, **you’re being harvested** — emotionally, neurologically, and psychologically.

This isn’t just some conspiracy rant. It’s backed by actual neuroscience, cognitive studies, and media research. I started digging into this topic during my research work on media psychology and behavioral science, and the findings honestly shocked me. What's worse is that most of the advice you see online is junk — influencers telling you to “just use willpower” or “take a walk” while they spend 12 hours editing their own viral clips. That advice doesn’t work because it ignores what you're really up against.

Here’s a comprehensive & angeringly necessary guide to why doomscrolling destroys your brain — and what you can actually do about it.

---

## Step 1: Understand what doomscrolling really *is*

You think you’re just “catching up on news” or “relaxing” between tasks. But doomscrolling is an engineered trap. The apps are built to hijack your information-seeking system — the dopamine-reward loop in your brain lights up every time you see something new, surprising, scary, or infuriating.

A 2021 study published in *Technology, Mind and Behavior* explains how platforms exploit **“salience bias”** — your brain pays more attention to negative or emotionally charged content because it feels urgent, even when it's not useful. That’s why you keep scrolling even when you feel worse.

The real kicker? According to the Center for Humane Technology (yes, the one behind *The Social Dilemma*), every piece of “bad news” you consume trains algorithms to feed you more of the same — outrage, fear, anxiety. Because these emotions keep you glued longer than joy or peace ever could.

---

## Step 2: Interrupt the “dopamine drip” addiction loop

You’re not addicted to your phone. You’re addicted to **the unpredictability of rewards**. It’s the exact mechanism slot machines use.

- **Start using “friction hacks”** to make scrolling harder. Move distracting apps off your home screen. Set screen time passcodes that only a friend knows (yes, really).
- **Schedule your scrolls** like coffee breaks. Give yourself two 20-minute sessions a day, max. Anything outside that is a trap.

---

## Step 3: Rewire your brain for *agency*, not alarm

The biggest danger of doomscrolling isn’t wasted time. It’s how helpless it makes you feel. You’re consuming endless problems with no solutions. That leads to “learned helplessness,” a term coined by psychologist Martin Seligman — when your brain starts believing action is pointless.

- Shift into *active consumption*. Before you scroll, ask: “Am I seeking knowledge or just stimulation?”
- Follow creators and journalists who inspire action, not paralyze with despair. Unfollow outrage baiters, even if they’re funny.

---

## Step 4: Replace the habit, don’t just remove it

You can’t just “stop scrolling.” You need a *replacement behavior* that gives your brain a similar pleasure hit — novelty, stimulation, control — without draining your energy.

Here are some insanely good resources that actually help:

1. **Podcast: “Your Undivided Attention” by Tristan Harris & Aza Raskin**  
   From the guys behind the *Social Dilemma*, this podcast breaks down how tech companies manipulate attention. Super digestible, but also deeply researched. You’ll never look at your phone the same way again.

2. **Book: “Stolen Focus” by Johann Hari**  
   NYT bestseller, author of *Lost Connections*. This book will make you furious with how much of your attention is literally stolen every day. Hari weaves personal stories with bombshell research — exploring how everything from social media to diet is rewiring your ability to focus. This is the best book on attention economics I’ve ever read. Felt like taking the red pill.

3. **App: Finch**  
   If your brain craves little dopamine hits, Finch channels that into something good. You raise a cute self-care pet by completing real-life wellness tasks — journaling, walking, meditating. The gamified structure makes healthy habits way more addictive than they should be. Silly? Maybe. Helpful? Extremely.

4. **App: BeFreed**  
   My favorite tool for rewiring learning and attention. The problem with doomscrolling is it gives you random content with no structure. BeFreed is the opposite. I use it when I want to dig into something like “how to deal with info overload” or “how to rewire your attention span.” You tell it what you're struggling with, and it creates an audio episode (usually 10–40 mins) from top books, interviews, and real research. You can pause, chat with the host, ask questions, and go deeper like talking to an actual thinking partner. Way more engaging than podcasts or YouTube spirals. I use it while walking or doing chores. It feels like listening to someone who actually respects your time and curiosity.

---

## Step 5: Build a “mental firewall” for real-world resilience

Doomscrolling thrives when your *inner world* is unprotected. It steals your hope, your motivation, your sense of control. But you can build resistance.

- Keep a “scroll journal” for a week. Write down what you read, how it made you feel, what action (if any) you took. You’ll start seeing patterns.
- Create a weekly “information fast” — 24 hours with no news, no social feeds. You’ll be shocked by how clear your mind feels.

---

## Step 6: Consume content that *expands* you, not drains you

Doomscrolling is passive input. But humans are meant to learn **actively**. When you expose your brain to ideas that challenge, uplift, or stretch you, it rewires faster and feels better.

Some of my go-to sources:

- **YouTube: “Andrew Huberman”**  
   Neuroscientist at Stanford. His breakdown on attention, dopamine, and tech addiction changed how I structure my day. Super accessible. Highly recommend his episode on “How to Increase Focus and Reduce Distractions.”

- **Book: “Digital Minimalism” by Cal Newport**  
   This isn’t preaching “quit all tech.” It’s about using technology with intention. Newport blends philosophy with productivity hacks. This book will help you *design your digital life* instead of being owned by it. Best decision-making framework for screen usage I’ve read.

So I was working a corporate job at Delhi since 2016(around 2 years) but still, My earning was very limited So I was thinking about earning some extra money. So I decided to do some extra work which can help me to make money and have fun also. I decided to be a Male Masseur and provide Body Massage Only to Ladies in Delhi at their home as well as Call Boy (PLAYBOY).

But that was not so easy and I had no idea about how to start the journey, I went to several Spas But not succeeded. So I posted several classified and ads about My services on some sites like Vivastreet and Skokka and Locanto.

And that thing worked for me. I got several calls from Females for home service. A lady also called me to discuss massage. She wanted to have a massage at her place. we discussed it on the phone.

She wanted to try my Body Massage service. So she asked me to meet at Rajeev Chauk, Delhi. I said I need to go to my room to bring some stuff to give you better service but she said today I just want to meet you over coffee and want to talk about some personal things after that I will let you know when I will be ready for your service. I said Ok. I left my office and took the metro for rajeev chauk.

I reached at Rajeev Chauk Metro Station, after 45 minutes and Called her. She picked and said that she was stuck in traffic and she will reach there in 10 minutes. I was waiting suddenly a Lady with a Car stopped in front of me and Said ""Lucky??"" Right?

I said ""Yes"" and sat in the Car.

I was feeling glad to see her because She was a damn beautiful and pretty lady. her boobs size was 36, the waist was 30, and the ass was 38 We left for CCD.

We reached and Ordered Coffee than she started talking about her, she told me that She is a working woman and doing a well-paid job in the government sector. she also told me about her married life and husband. She said: ""My husband belongs to a very high profile family and his father is working in HCS( Haryana Civil Services) But her husband is unemployed and also a traditional boring person. He sleeps at 7.30 PM. He never talks to me and also doesn't like to listen to me. He spent my salary and I have no issue with this but he doesn't care about What I want. He never pampers me"". She became emotional and The tears started flowing from her eyes. I said, ""Calm down"". I understood what she wants. She also asked about myself, my profession, and my education. I told her everything about myself. Then she said I need some relaxation from this type of stress. I want a good listener who can listen to me and understand my emotions. i want a hug and want to kiss someone. I want someone who can pamper me.

I was listening very carefully..but her emotions became limitless. So I said, Please Calm down. This place is not good to talk about such things. We should go somewhere else so that we can sort out these things and I will give you everything whatever you want to have from my side.

We have talked about Many things and Now she trusted me because I just saw her face and eyes and tell her that what she wanted. She told me all these things that she wanted to say to someone. She was very happy now because she found a good listener as she wanted.

She was happy to hear that I understood her feelings.

So she said, let's go somewhere else. After some time see bring me at one of her places.

She relaxed on her sofa and started talking again and started crying. After a few minutes of listening to her. I said don't weep please and let me make you relax.

We went to her bed than she said it's very weird and strange for me. But I hold her hand. And said don't worry I will make it comfortable for you.

She said ""It's a very weird feeling for me, i never did these things with another man, and then she closed her eyes.

I put my lips on her lips and started kissing and she was also smooching me. Slowly I was kissing on her neck and licking her shoulder and neck area.she was moaning and said it's tickling. Please lick my whole body I love it when you are doing this. So I started licking her neck again and slowly I push her left side boob so she stopped me.

She said"" Not Now. I love Slowly""

So I sucked her Tongue and bite slowly on her neck. she moaned loudly. and then I ask her to remove her top. She removed her top. She wore a red bra. I started licking on her backside and started biting on behind her neck. and slowly I push her boobs. this time she holds my other hand and started pushing her another boob with my hand. then I laid down and pulled me upon her. then i started sucking her nipples one by one. she was moaning louder and louder and slowly I started rubbing her thighs which makes her turn ON and I insert my hand into her panty. She was terribly Wet. I started fingering on her pussy and i found her g spot and started rubbing. she was moaning too loudly and after sucking and fingering her around 20 minutes, she squirted.

Than I started kissing and licking her waist and navel and than I reached at her pussy and i spread the clitoris and insert my tongue into her pussy and started licking. She again started moaning and started moving her butt.

I inserted my tongue deep into her pussy and licked G spot which makes her turn on. and after 20 minutes of licking, She said "" I can't tolerate more, Please fuck me now""

Then I put her legs on my shoulder and insert my dick slowly. It was little hard but the pussy was wet so i inserted my dick into her pussy in one time. She started shouting and ask me to hold on.

I stopped and waited for a minute and than she said""now fuck me"". and i started fucking. after fucking of 5 minutes in this position, She said""I want to sit on your dick""

and She came to my dick and sat on it and started moving. Now she was enjoying more and I was also enjoying too much  and she also started kissing me.

She did this at 10 minutes and than she said to fuck in Doggy style. I fucked her in Doggy style as well.

We enjoyed a lot on that day. it was 12, O Clock and she said now you should go. Se booked a Cab for me and gave me 1000 rs also.

I said what is it for, I didn't give you Body Massage?? She said You need money , I need love. Please keep it..and Next time I will call you for Body Massage than I will cut the money from your service and also blinked at me.

**must haves**  
- real leather, pebbled preferred but i also like smooth (basically just not that buffed suede adjacent look or super shiny)  
- zipper top  
- a long crossbody strap, i'm plus size with a large chest and often wear sweatshirts/bulky jackets! i like the 47"" baggu length and wear it fully extended or a few inches short, so like a 23""+ drop as per my tape measure  
- the same size or a little larger than a baggu nylon medium crescent  
- durable, this will be an every day bag and i’m not too easy on my bags  
- slouchy, or at least structured bottom + slouchy top  
- available in (preferably) a very dark brown, a burgundy reddish color, or something in the family between them. availability in black is good too for the perfect bag :)  

**wants to have**  
- no top handle that sticks up  
- lined interior  
- gold or brass hardware (not silver)  
- no over the top branding/logos, subtle is perfectly fine  

**nice to haves**  
- 1-2 interior pockets  
- good spot to hang keychains or bag charms  
- rectangle or crescent shape as opposed to “tall”  

**budget considerations**  
- ~$350 USD hard budget all in w/ shipping considerations, i would prefer to stay under ~$250 but i know that's a tall order. if you find a bag that hits every single one of my points, i could be convinced to go up to $400

We’re on the phone, she knows about it, but not what it is. Irrelevant to the story sorta but whatever. I’m using my beloved Clover Armor 10 mm hook. I’m still doing my morning routine, so drinking coffee and such. I had to stop crocheting for 2.5 seconds to stretch further than I thought I’d need to, to reach my mug. Whatever… it was a butt lift and long stretch. I didn’t even have to move my legs. Butt back on the bed. 

My crochet hook isn’t connected to the project. I feel around. Nope. (I’d been sitting on my bed.) I shook the project. Nothing. Got up and shook out my comforter, my sheets, moved my pillows. Nada. So now I start digging. I’m throwing WIPs everywhere, cat beds are flying. I’m digging in the 1/16” space between the mattress and headboard. I even emptied my little garbage bag. Went through the paper recycling pile next to the bed. Hard nope. It’s gone. Just gone. Vanished into the LauraLand vortex of black holes where time and space have collided and lost all meaning. 

So here I sit with a gift I can’t finish because I was down to my last 10 mm hook. Ugh. So long story short, Long Island must have become the crochet capital of New York, because there are not only no Clover Armor 10 mm hooks available in any craft stores near me, but even the shipping is out of stock. So I order some random whatever from Amazon. Not cheap, but pretty. Then I remember Walmart 😣 but I really have some good mojo right now and was flying through this thing. I put in a same day delivery order (made at 3 this morning) and now I’m stuck with Boye. Now, don’t get me wrong. I cut my teeth on Boye. They were fine. When I was a beginner. Once I switched to Clover, you know… you don’t go back. 🤦‍♀️ The handle is weird. It’s a big fat metal thing with no grip, the taper is funky, and I physically can’t hook as fast. I’m so annoyed. Y’all know that when I get back from the post office to mail it out, my beloved Clover will be on top of my pillow. Thanks for listening.",2,1763839079.0,crochet,3,1.0,False

1p41mhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/regularshow/comments/1p41mhg/i_have_a_theory/,I have a theory,"Ok what I'm about to say might sound a bit too much but bare with me. So today I was rewatching some regular show and one of the episodes I rewatched was season 2 episode 2 ""It's time"". Then I got to the scene when Mordecai pushes Rigby off the microwave and he turns into dust which means he died and I thought to myself, what if this version if rigby is permanently dead and the Rigby we see throughout the rest of the show was not the same Rigby but rather a  different version. And then I thought ""what if when Mordecai time traveled back to the morning if the episode at the coffee shop he woke up in a different timeline (I like to call it timeline B) and that is the same timeline until the end of the show and the other timeline (Timeline A) was the timeline from the pilot until season 2 episode 2 ? So that means that in the original timeline Mordecai and Rigby are missing since Rigby died permanently and Mordecai time traveled and came to the 2nd timeline and in the B timeline we have Mordecai from the original timeline along with another ""new"" versions of Rigby, Pops, Benson, Muscle Man, High Fives and Skips. Also if the timeline had started from the 2nd episode of season 2 instead of the pilot then that means that the different versions of the characters didn't have any memory of the events from timeline A. That would also mean that in timeline B Mordecai would be the only one to remember the Timeline A events since he is the original version.",5,1763838956.0,regularshow,0,1.0,False

1p41iwg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p41iwg,My first solo moto-camping Trip abroad. Riding a Honda Hornet from the UK to the Alps,"In June, I decided I’d go on a solo camping adventure around the Alps on my 2005 Honda CB600F Hornet. Not the obvious choice for international motorbike travel, but I was working with what I got. My route took me through northern France, Switzerland, Northern Italy and back up through France. I’d just finished reading Jupiter's Travels and was inspired to explore countries on a bike. I’d never been abroad on the bike before, I thought it would be a great way to find out if this Motorbike touring thing works for me. So I set off from Bristol with my camping gear and made my way towards Folkestone to get on the Channel Tunnel. I thought my battery had died when I arrived in Calais, I was chuffed to find out my engine was running, I just couldn’t hear it over the other bikes that I was sharing a carriage with. Crisis averted. 



The first night I camped in a place called ‘Eco Land’. A gorgeous camp next to Le Marais du Grand Clair, a big lake not far from Cambrai. The camp was also a farm for donkeys and sheep, which spared no time at all in going through my clean clothes and chucking them on the floor. I decided to grab a couple of cans of beer and sit by the lake to watch the sun set. I didn’t realise that the staff close the campsite gates at 9 pm. As I was too late to make it back in time, I had to break into the campsite by climbing over a fence covered in bushes. I’d not been in France 24 hours, and it already felt like I was committing a crime. 



The next day I decided to make my way to a campsite near Nancy called ‘Camping de Villey-le-Sec’. I thought, as the weather was so nice, I’d avoid the Peage and make my way along the winding country roads of Northeast France. I felt like I was going back in time; a lot of the building looked very old, and I hardly saw anybody there. Felt a bit like I had the whole place to myself. When I got to Villey-le-Sec, I stocked up on beer and watched the river, which seemed to be completely flat. 



In the morning, I packed up the bike again and started to make my way south towards Bern in Switzerland. I remember the rolling hills were starting to merge into mountains. I never did catch a sign saying ‘Welcome to Switzerland’, but I was beginning to get the idea that I was no longer in France. I assumed the Peage system would still be a thing there, so I just kept riding until I found one of the pay points. As the motorways were starting to get more advanced, snaking in and out of tunnels and long bridges, I was starting to realise that this wasn’t the same as France and that I would probably have to pay online. 



I stayed with a lovely couple in Bern, who had a huge house with views overlooking a spectacular mountain range. The room I was in could sleep 5, but I was the only one for the 2 nights that I stayed there. I made use of my first day of not riding by getting the train to Bern itself. I cannot overstate enough how stunning that city is. The architecture was incredible, everything was very clean, and you could drink water from the many fountains around the city. There is a beautiful, clear turquoise river that runs through it past green parks and under tall archway bridges. The people I stayed with washed my clothes and made me a packed lunch for my journey into the Alps the next day. I’m hugely grateful for their hospitality.   
  
The plan for the next day was to head south through Interlaken, past the Brienzersee lake and up into the Grimsel Pass. Honestly, seeing the Alps come into view for the first time and making my way up that pass was one of the most incredible motorbiking experiences I’ve ever had. The roads were smooth and fast, and on the day I went, there was hardly anyone else up there. Approaching the top, I was starting to ride past patches of snow. Something I’ve never seen before whilst riding the bike. After a quick toilet break at he top, I was chatting to a bunch of other bikers from all over Europe. They seemed pretty surprised that I’d come all the way from England on a Hornet.  Didn’t see anyone else there with a UK licence plate that day, so it felt like quite the achievement to summit my first pass of the Alps.  
  
From there, I made my way down the other side to a place called Brig. For the first time on the journey, I could see huge rain clouds. I pulled into a petrol station and popped my wet-weather gear just in case. I needed to make my way over the Simplon Pass into Northern Italy that day. As I started to make way along the mountain road, the heavens opened, and my waterproof gear did nothing against the torrential downpour. I was really looking forward to riding this pass before, but now I was in survival mode. I carefully made my way over the mountain pass and into Italy, where the rain mercifully subsided. I booked a small Air B&B in the town of Omegna, where I could dry off my clothes and get something to eat. As I was parking up the bike, I could hear a church full of people blasting out hymns with a brass band. You could tell the folks around there really enjoyed a good sing on a Sunday evening.   
  


On Monday morning, I headed south again past Lago d’Orta. I really felt like I was in Italy now; there were a lot more scooters on the road. Some of them rode really fast! The weather was hot, and my kit had properly dried out now. I didn't want to take the motorways, so it was a lot of riding that day, my first stop was Aosta, as I wanted to make my way up the Saint Burnards Pass. I’d heard amazing things about it, so  I definitely did not want to miss it. It really lived up to the hype, snaking hilly roads that followed a river, eventually giving way to much more mountainous terrain. It looked like the intro to The Italian Job, absolutely stunning scenery. When I got to the top, it felt like a real achievement. Suddenly, everything that wasn't tarmac was covered in deep snow. I was struggling to believe my eyes. It was the middle of June, and I could walk about in thick snow. I had a cake and a coffee as a treat for getting that far. I still had a long way to go to get to my final destination that day, Chamonix.



I really wanted to visit Chamonix for a long time, as it had one of the highest cable car rides in the world, and I wanted to see what Mount Blanc was like. I was staying in a stunning campsite on the side of the valley called ‘Camping des Deux Glaciers’. They offered me a free train journey into Chamonix centre, where I wandered around the place for a bit, letting the day's journey finally settle in my mind. Everything apart from a kabab shop was open when I got there. So I grabbed some dinner and walked my way along the river until I got back to the tent. I met a nice guy from the Netherlands who came down on his Suzuki V-Strom a few days before me. Luckily for me, his English was perfect, which was great as I spoke very little of any other language, let alone Dutch. The day after, I woke up early to get the cable car up to Aiguille du Midi. The views were incredible; you could see for miles around. Truly one of the highlights of the entire Journey, I really enjoyed reading about how the early mountaineers climbed that place before there was any sign of civilisation up there. I was chuffed with myself for my journey on the bike, but to get up that mountain with nothing but a rope and an ice pick was a whole other level. 



I knew from that point the rest of the journey would be heading closer to home again, across the flatter parts of France and eventually up to Cherbourg, where I would hop on a ferry back home. I packed my tent and headed toward the Mount Blanc tunnel. As I was waiting in the long queue, I had the bike in neutral and it was just ticking over for half an hour. I noticed the neutral light was starting to flicker.   
  
Suddenly, the bike’s engine cut out; the thing that I had been dreading for basically the whole journey had finally happened. I was facing uphill towards the tunnel, so I decided to swing the bike around and run with it downhill. I clicked up into second and let the clutch out when I built up a bit of speed. Pressing the starter button at the same time, I successfully bump-started the bike. Aware that it could go again at any time, I gave the throttle loads of beans, trying to keep it above four thousand revs. After another 15 minutes of queuing, which felt like an eternity, I eventually arrived at the place where you buy your ticket to enter the tunnel. The nice man at the counter was explaining that I should not speed, and I should definitely not be overtaking anyone in the tunnel. All the while, I’ve revving the tits of this boiling hot engine, he must have thought, ‘What is this idiot doing?’. Effectively, I was trying to sort out my wallet into my pockets with my left hand while my right hand was keeping the revs up. What a nightmare, I was very glad to be heading off into the tunnel, giving the engine a chance to cool down.   
  
As I arrived on the other side of the tunnel, back in Italy again, I swung the bike right and up into the mountains. This time, heading up a pass called the Col du Petit-Saint-Bernard. Again, one that is highly rated, lots of twisty roads and hairpins. I was pretty knackered by the time I got to the top. I wanted to stop and take in the incredible views, but I was worried that the bike would stall out again. So I carried on down the other side until I found a place called Bourg-Saint-Maurice. There, I stopped at a Lidl to pick up some supplies and get my clothes washed. I decided that I would probably need to get a new battery for the bike, as the current one was ancient. So I put in the Satnav to go to Annecy, a huge detour away from the next Alpine pass I wanted to go to, but a necessary one. I eventually made it up there to an open battery shop, took a picture of the battery I needed and showed it to the nice people at the counter who spoke very little English. Google Translate really saved me on a few occasions. My GCSE French lessons seemed very far away at many points throughout my journey. 



I fitted the new battery to my bike in the car park and then headed toward my final destination for that day, a small village to the west of the Alps called Allemont. I made my way down these incredible valleys to a town called La Chambre. On my way through the town I saw a TVR and a Ferrari heading the other way. I knew then that I was in the right place.  The road heading there was incredible, called the D256, it snakes over the Col du Glandon. I’d never ridden so hard in my life, chuffed that the ordeal at the Mt Blanc Tunnel was over and that I had a new battery to charge up. I really pushed that little Hornet as hard as I dared on public roads, knowing that this would be my last mountain pass of the journey I really made the most of that road while there was nobody on it. I felt like a proper motorbiker at that point. I’d ridden all this way on my own, and this was the reward.  
  
When I eventually turned up at Allemont, it was getting pretty late. I chatted to my French neighbour about what I got up to that day. Made some chicken kebabs from the supplies I got earlier, and went to bed. Aching all over from all the riding I had been doing, but chuffed that I was making it through what I had planned. 



In the morning, there was a fresh water fountain in the village that I refilled my bottle from. Made some breakfast and headed out towards Grenoble and onto the big motorway that would take me towards Bourges. This would be by far the longest day out of all of them, just miles and miles of motorways. Heading through Lyon, this was the first heavily populated area I encountered on the trip. I thought about stopping there and visiting the city, but I had to make up so much ground. I decided to continue on the Peage route. While I was bombing it through central France, I felt a sharp pain in my neck, so I pulled into a service station to fill up and check out what had hit me. I pulled out a wasp’s stinger. It must have got between my neckerchief and my jacket. I carried on to Bourges and rocked up to a campsite right in the middle of town called Camping de Bourges, a nice enough place. I didn’t spend long there as I was craving a burger and a beer. I spent the rest of the evening listening to music, safe in the knowledge that I was over halfway through France and the next day I would be on my way to Le Mans.



The next day, I had a much shorter journey, only around 3 hours, which at that point seemed trivially small compared to the normal 5-7 hours I was getting used to. I made my way through the much flatter terrain of central France on my way to Le Mans. It was right in the middle of a heatwave and getting towards 37 degrees Celsius around 4 pm. I got to the museum just as it was at its hottest outside; it was slightly cooler in the museum, which was a welcome treat. There were a lot of cool old racing bikes from Endurance racing history. I loved to see all of the models of every racing car that was ever in the Le Mans 24 hours.



My last day was heading toward Mont Saint-Michel, which was a pretty incredible place. I really enjoyed just walking around the street and alleyways of the old monastery. 



I then made my way back up to Cherbourg through Normandy. Found the ferry port and waited in line to board the ship. I made friends with an elderly gentleman who was making his way back over to Poole as well. He had some kind of Triumph scrambler and had been to see his friends that week. He seemed shocked that I had made it around Europe on the bike I had. Getting back home again was a strange feeling. I had been in survival mode for the past few weeks, and suddenly everything had to go back to normal. I think about that trip fairly often, and I wish I could do it all over again.

1p41dze,http://balanced-life.ca,Keep A Food Diary For At Least One Month,"When it comes to managing weight, step one is brutally honest self-awareness—a bit like reading your old Facebook posts, except this time it’s about what you eat. To truly understand your eating habits, you’ll need to track every meal, snack, and sneaky midnight fridge raid. Welcome to your food diary, where judgment is optional, but enlightenment is guaranteed.

Start by listing everything you eat and drink—yes, even that handful of chips you stole from a co-worker. Jot down meal times, portion sizes, and every condiment (looking at you, ranch dressing). You’ll notice patterns, like skipping breakfast or inhaling cookies at 3 p.m. like it’s a competitive sport.



Tracking your meals is like uncovering a food-based whodunit. The culprit behind those extra pounds? Hidden calories. That “healthy” smoothie? Basically a milkshake in a yoga outfit. And don’t even get me started on coffee creamers; they’re sugar bombs masquerading as harmless additions.



Go old-school with a notebook, or embrace the tech gods with apps that scan barcodes and calculate macros. Some apps even cheer you on for eating a carrot—because, hey, validation is everything. But remember, this isn’t about calorie obsession. It’s about catching the culprits behind your snack drawer’s depletion.



Stick with this for a month, and you’ll see patterns emerge. Maybe you’re a serial breakfast skipper or an overzealous condiment enthusiast. Whatever the case, this diary will reveal the truth. Use this knowledge to adjust your habits, like eating a balanced breakfast or realizing that mayo doesn’t belong on everything.



A food diary isn’t about shame; it’s about power. Knowing what you consume empowers you to make mindful choices. It’s like therapy for your diet—with fewer tears and more fibre. So, embrace your food diary. It’s your ticket to better health, fewer regrets, and maybe even discovering you don’t actually hate kale.

Start your food diary as soon as you start hating your love handles. Who knows? It might just turn you into the mindful eater you always pretended to be.",1,1763838375.0,BalancedlifeApp,0,1.0,False

The next morning I woke up, brushed my teeth, made the same coffee I drink every day, and sat on my sofa replying to boring work messages. My phone buzzed with a notification from Instagram: **“*****Optimus.Prime33 mentioned you in a post.*****”**

I rolled my eyes, thinking it was probably some spam reel tagging random people. Opened it anyway.

It wasn’t a reel.  
It was a photo.  
A picture of my building.

My building — not a stock photo, not something anyone could Google. My actual building, taken from the street. The angle was unmistakable. My floor. My balcony railing. The light from my bedroom window. Everything.

Caption: **“You’re still here.”**

I remember sitting there staring at my phone thinking, Who the fuck is this? I clicked the profile again. Still private. Still no posts except this one. Still following just me. Still no followers. It felt like a blank mask staring back.

I tried blocking him. Instagram behaved like it worked — “User blocked” — but when I refreshed the page, the account was still there. Nothing changed. I tried again. Same thing. The account clung to me like glue.

I shrugged it off and went to work because honestly, I wasn’t about to lose my day over some idiot with a Transformers username.

Later that afternoon, another notification: **another tag.**

This time, it was a picture of me.

Walking to the lift.

Taken from the lobby.

The lobby was empty when I left my apartment. I’m not imagining that. I didn’t see anyone standing near the stairs or pretending to scroll by the wall. It was dead quiet. But the photo was taken from the corner — the exact opposite corner from where I was walking.

The caption said: **“You don’t notice anything.”**

That pissed me off more than it scared me.

I commented under the post: **“Who are you?”**

He replied instantly.  
Not a second of delay.  
Just: **“:)”**

I felt the hair on my arms rise. I don’t know why that stupid smiley hit so hard, but it did. Something about the way he responded so fast, like he was waiting for me to ask.

I clicked unfollow out of pure irritation. All his posts vanished instantly. Like his profile wiped itself clean the moment I cut the link. When I followed again to check, he accepted immediately. No delay. Almost like he’d been staring at his screen waiting for me to click the button.

Two days later, I woke up early for work — earlier than usual because I had a meeting I didn’t want to be late for — and I found another tag.

A screenshot.  
My old Facebook profile.  
Like ancient-old.

Photos from college. Cringe memes I’d forgotten I posted. People I don’t even speak to anymore. He scraped something from an era of my life I barely remember, and posted it like some kind of digital trophy.

Caption: **“Always liked this one.”**

Liked WHAT?  
The picture?  
Me?  
The life I had back then?

I didn’t know, and honestly, I didn’t want to think about it.

I started to get uneasy. Not terrified yet — just annoyed and unsettled. Like when you know a mosquito is in your room but you can’t find it.

Yesterday, it escalated.

I left work, walked toward my bike parked near the gate like always, and my phone buzzed. Another tag.

A picture of my bike.  
Same angle I see it from when I walk up to it.  
Taken moments before I got there.

I scanned the area thinking maybe some idiot from the office was messing with me. But nobody was standing around. Nobody was hiding behind cars or pillars. It was just… empty.

Caption: **“You really don’t know me.”**

Yeah, I fucking don’t.  
And that was the problem.

Last night I sat on my couch for two straight hours scrolling through my memories trying to place him. School? No. College? No. Office? Definitely not. A friend of a friend? Nothing. A random neighbor? No. Someone I pissed off years ago? No idea.

There was nothing. No connection. No shared history. No reason this guy should know anything about me.

This morning, things got real.

About forty minutes ago, he posted a picture of my doorbell.

My NAMEPLATE.

Up close.

Clear as daylight.  
He had stood right there.

Caption: **“Back home soon?”**

That was it for me. I grabbed my keys, grabbed my phone, didn’t even check if the door was locked, just walked straight out. Didn’t call anyone, didn’t tell anyone, just walked fast and didn’t look back.

I must’ve reached the police station in five minutes flat. Probably broke a walking speed record.

And now I’m sitting in this shitty plastic chair with people screaming down the hall and constables walking past without making eye contact. The fan above me is rattling like it’s about to fall, my palms are sweating, and I’m typing all of this out because I haven’t figured out how to explain this without sounding insane.

“Hi sir, some guy with a Transformers username is tagging me in pictures of my balcony.”  
Yeah, great. Sounds normal.

I opened Instagram to check if he posted anything new. Nothing. The same set of posts, arranged neatly like a timeline of creeping dread.

I tapped each one again:

My balcony.  
Me near the lift.  
My old Facebook profile.  
My bike.  
My doorbell.

I zoomed into each picture trying to find clues. Reflections. Shadows. Footprints. Corners. Anything. There was nothing. Whoever took these photos was careful. Too careful.

I checked the timestamps. They lined up with my routine, almost perfectly. Morning, afternoon, post-work, late evening.

The fucker knew my schedule.

I even checked the metadata on the photos — Instagram strips most of it, but I checked anyway. Nothing. 

I tried Googling his username. Nothing. No Reddit. No Twitter. No stray gaming IDs. Nothing in any breach database. No traces. Like the account exists only on Instagram, only connected to me.

I even tried messaging him. “Tell me who you are.”  
No reply.

I was halfway through typing a second message when I realized I was being stupid and stopped before giving him more attention.

And now I’m here, stuck in a police station, typing this all down while constables keep walking past me like I’m a stain on the floor.

I wish I could say I’m calm. I’m not. I’m trying so hard to pretend I’m not affected, but my chest feels tight, and I keep checking the station doorway expecting him to walk in.

I keep refreshing Instagram every few seconds and each time I brace myself for another notification.

I swear I’m shaking writing this. All of this feels unreal and too real at the same time. A stranger following me everywhere, taking photos, posting them seconds later, reacting instantly when I unfollow or comment… It's too much.

I’m trying to appear normal in the police station, but I keep glancing at the entrance. Every time the door moves, my heartbeat jumps. Every time someone coughs behind me, I flinch.

Someone has been watching me for a week, closely enough to know when I leave my room, when I enter my lift, when I park my bike, when I unlock my door, when I panic.

I’m trying to steady myself, but my fingers won’t stop tapping the screen.

My phone buzzed as I was typing this out.

Another tag.  
Another post.

My hands are cold. I opened Instagram without thinking.

This time it was a picture of me.

Sitting on this same plastic chair.  
Typing on my phone.

My shoulders hunched the exact way they are right now. My thumb mid-swipe. My leg bent at the same angle. Everything identical.

It was taken from beside me.  
Right next to my shoulder.  
Like someone stood inches away while I typed.

And I didn’t notice anybody standing there.

Today she came home in tears because her store manager spent the day criticising her English and her accent. The manager asked things like “How long have you been learning English?” and “How did you even pass the interview with this level of English?” She also refused to repeat herself when my wife didn’t understand one of her instructions the first time.

For context, my wife has a B2 level of English, and she’s worked in administrative roles before. She took customer orders all day today without a single mistake, so there was no legitimate reason for the manager to single her out like that.

I honestly can’t shake the feeling that this might be xenophobia or racism.

Is this kind of behaviour normal in UK workplaces?
If not, what steps should we take? I don’t want her to quit immediately, but I also don’t want her to keep being treated like this.

Any advice would be appreciated.",5,1763837663.0,Costa,4,0.78,False

Anyway my tongue started to tingling which happens when I’m anxious sometimes, but goes way if I distracted myself. It didn’t work, then my throat felt tingling and like it was closing up. I was also coughing a lot.

I am super in tune with my body and so I notice even slight changes. But essentially since starting, I feel a persistent vibrational/shaking throughout my body and higher heart rate almost continuously. 

I would describe it as feeling slightly jittery on too much caffeine, except my caffeine intake is the same, and it’ll be even when I’m trying to sleep 12+ hours after coffee (though it’s present all the time). My baseline HR is normally 60-low 70s but I’ve been checking it and noticing that it’s upper 70s-90s now. It’s persistent enough that it’s impacting my sleep (like it’s keeping me up). And even if my HR is normal (like mid 70s) I can still feel it and it’s almost continuous. 

Doesn’t seem to be anxiety related or anything else. 

Is this a sauna effect? Or something else? I otherwise feel normal but it’s definitely mildly disruptive and I’m not sure what’s going on.",2,1763837376.0,HOTWORXWarriors,5,0.75,False

I (26F) agreed to drive my cousin “Lia” (24F) to work for a few weeks while her car was in the shop. She works near my office, so it wasn’t a huge inconvenience.

But from day one, she started treating my car like it was her personal trunk.

She left a pair of heels, two sweaters, half-eaten snacks, and even a work binder in the backseat. I asked her to grab her stuff multiple times. She always said, “I’ll get it tomorrow.”

Then last week, I went to pick her up and the passenger seat was covered in crumbs and sticky coffee spots. She laughed and said, “My bad, I had breakfast in your car earlier.”

Earlier?
She had gone outside my house, unlocked my car using the spare key I lent her only for emergencies, and sat inside eating before I woke up.

I told her that wasn’t okay, and she said I was “overreacting about a car.”

Finally, the last straw: she spilled lotion all over the backseat from a container she “forgot was open.” She didn’t apologize, she just said, “Well, at least your car smells nice now.”

I told her I wouldn’t be driving her anymore and took the spare key back. She blew up saying I was abandoning her and “punishing her for being comfortable.”

Family is split, some say she was taking advantage, others say “it’s just a car.”

I realized recently that whenever I’m spiraling, my mind is either 10 years in the future (""What if everything goes wrong?"") or stuck in the past (""Why did I say that?""). Meanwhile, my body is right here, hyperventilating and shaking.



I found a technique called **""Grounding""** that essentially acts as a hard reset button for the nervous system. It anchors you in the ""now"" and signals to your brain: *""I'm here. I'm safe. Everything is okay""*.



It’s called the **5-4-3-2-1 Technique**. It takes literally 60 seconds, and you can do it in a crowded room without anyone noticing.



Here is the exact protocol I use when I feel my chest getting tight:

**5 Things You Can SEE** Don't just scan the room. Focus on the details.

* The specific pattern of shadows on the wall.
* The exact color of your coffee mug.
* The shape of a clock’s numbers.

**4 Things You Can HEAR** Tune into the subtle background noises you usually ignore.

* The low hum of the refrigerator.
* Distant traffic or laughter.
* The sound of your own breath leaving your nose.

**3 Things You Can TOUCH** Shift your focus to physical sensation.

* The texture of your shirt sleeve against your wrist.
* The coolness of your phone in your hand.
* The warmth of your palms resting on your legs.

**2 Things You Can SMELL** This one can be tricky, but try to detect pleasant or neutral scents.

* Freshly washed sheets (if you're home).
* The faint smell of hand soap on your skin.

**1 Thing You Can TASTE** Savor whatever is in your mouth intentionally.

* The lingering mint from your toothpaste.
* The aftertaste of your morning tea or coffee.

**Why this actually works:** When you force your brain to focus on sensory details (like the texture of a shirt), it physically cannot hold onto the ""panic narrative"" at the same time. It interrupts the loop.



I’ve started practicing this even when I feel calm, just to build the muscle memory so it's ready when the ""storm"" hits.



**Quick Note:** I know it’s hard to remember these steps when your brain feels like it's on fire. I actually designed a small digital ""Calm Card"" that lists these steps so I can keep it as a wallpaper on my phone or in my pocket.

If anyone wants the card (or the full anxiety toolkit I put together), let me know in the comments and I'll share the link, or you can grab it from my bio.

I’m writing this with tears in my eyes because I don’t know how to move on from something that wasn’t even a relationship… just a moment in time that felt like a movie.

I (27F) met a guy (31M) while working abroad. We were put behind the same desk for a week, and somehow ended up talking more than actually working. He was confident, sarcastic, a little arrogant, and acted like nothing ever affected him. But I could tell immediately that all of that was a shield.

He pushed people away before they ever had the chance to get close.

And for some reason… that made me curious.

We slowly got comfortable with each other. Soft teasing, small jokes, playing games during breaks. One silly moment that stuck with me: he let me color in his tattoos with a felt tip pen, pretending not to care but smiling the whole time. He talked big about how “feelings are dumb,” in that emotionally constipated, macho-joking way. It was ridiculous, but it also made him seem less untouchable.

Then one day he told me, “Stop it.”
I didn’t understand at first. But he meant my mask — the cheerful, bubbly version of myself I put on for work. It stung, but he wasn’t wrong. So I stopped pretending around him.

And weirdly… he liked the real version of me more.

We texted a bit. I cooked for him, and he loved it. I started bringing him lunches even though he teased me for “feeding him too much.” But he ate all of it every time.

Then he invited me to hang out with him and a few coworkers at his accommodation — movies, beers, nothing fancy. But he asked in this almost shy way that made me smile.

That night changed everything.

I was tipsy, he looked too good for his own good, and even though the room was full of people, I could feel his attention shift toward me over and over. He didn’t show it openly, but he kept glancing at me like he was waiting for the others to leave.

Eventually… they did.

We ended up on opposite ends of the couch, awkward and unsure. I half-joked that he could use my lap as a pillow. He hesitated — then he actually did it.

He fell asleep on my chest. I stroked his back and played with his hair. He completely melted. This tough, closed-off, tattooed guy suddenly looked like a warm, sleepy kitten . I kissed the top of his head without thinking.

We fell asleep together like that.
At some point he woke up, handed me shorts so I wouldn’t sleep in jeans, and pulled me into his arms. We cuddled until morning.

It was one of the sweetest nights of my life.

The next day, everything crashed.
He shut down. Denied anything happened.
Pretended to be cold again.

A coworker who found out made things worse by telling others, which pushed him even further away. But even then, whenever I asked for a lighter, he was the first one to reach for it. And if someone else beat him to it, I’d see something sad flicker in his eyes.
It confused me… more than I like to admit.

We got separated at work for two weeks, and I convinced myself he didn’t care.
But when we finally worked together again, he admitted something quietly:

He wasn’t ignoring me because he didn’t care.
He was trying to protect me.

He didn’t want gossip to ruin my work experience.
He didn’t want people talking.
He even flirted with another girl publicly so attention would shift away from me.

It almost made me cry.

But right after that, he got fired.
Last minute. Unexpected. Pure chaos.
The trains weren’t working, transportation was a mess, and he was overwhelmed, trying to figure out how to get to the airport alone.

So I offered to drive him — 2.5 hours away.

He looked shocked. Then grateful.
He kept saying he couldn’t repay me. But I didn’t want repayment. I wanted to give him a soft goodbye instead of the messy, painful ending we almost had.

The day of the trip felt surreal.
I got ready, drove to his place, and he made me coffee.
When he came out in his travel outfit — clean, put-together, hair styled — I felt something twist in my chest. I couldn’t look at him too long without feeling overwhelmed.

In the car, he tried pushing me away again with loud screaming metal music.
I just smiled and drove.

Eventually he changed the music to something softer, opened my drink for me, and made sure both of our phones were charging.

And then he talked.
Like really talked.

For almost two hours, he opened up about his childhood, past relationships, mistakes, dreams, hopes, plans. He was gentle, sincere, vulnerable — a completely different version of himself than the one he shows the world.

I felt lucky to see that side of him.

At the airport, walking him to his gate felt like walking toward the end of something I wasn’t ready to lose. He kept saying he couldn’t repay me, but I told him he didn’t have to.

We lingered. Smoked. Walked slowly.
Neither of us wanted the moment to end.

Then he looked at me with this raw honesty and said:

“You are the nicest person I have ever met.”

I didn’t know what to do with that.
I still feel tears rise when I think about it.

I told him I’d miss him.
He called it childish.
But when he realized I meant it… he softened completely. His eyes shimmered.

I asked for a hug. He said yes.
We hugged for a long time — quiet, warm, heartbreaking.

I asked if I could kiss his cheek.
He blushed and said yes again.

Then he had to go.

He looked at me one last time, with something like hurt — or gratitude — in his eyes. Then he disappeared through the gate and didn’t look back.

I walked to my car with my heart in my throat.
Sad. Grateful. Confused. More emotional than I expected.
It felt like the end of a strange little story that happened in the wrong place at the wrong time.

He was only in my life briefly, but that softness he showed me — the part he hides from everyone — is something I’ll always treasure.

It felt like a movie.
And I can’t get it out of my head.",2,1763836588.0,offmychest,0,0.75,False

# 🚀 Player Turns $5 into $500,000 on MetaWin Limbo - The Biggest Win of November 2025

**The crypto casino world just witnessed one of the most insane wins of the year.** A MetaWin player known as 'mjouan' turned a **$5 bet into $501,652.30** playing Limbo Zero - MetaWin's zero house edge version of the popular crash-style game.

# The Win That Broke the Interne

Over the weekend of November 3rd, mjouan hit an **x100 multiplier** on Limbo Zero, walking away with over half a million dollars from a single $5 bet. MetaWin confirmed the win on their official Twitter, celebrating their first 100,000x payout milestone.

Maybe it's better this way. At least he won't have to accept the fact that his parents didn't love each other.

I tried hard to persuade myself, even though tears uncontrollably streamed down my face. I couldn't tell if it was joy from rebirth or sorrow from losing my pup.

I just... simply wanted to cry.

It wasn't until Mom knocked on the door, telling me to get up, that I truly, sincerely felt I had been reborn.

I was a child with parents again.

After composing myself a little, I went downstairs.

The first day of rebirth had to be a happy one. It absolutely must not start with sadness!

But when I saw Aron standing at the door through the window from the stair landing, I still couldn't help but take a few steps back.

Coward.

It wasn't until I confirmed he couldn't see me even if he looked up that I subconsciously cursed myself.

You've been reborn, why be afraid of him?

But, my subconscious still made me instinctively want to stay away from him, further away.

To avoid being caught by him again.

""Sis, coming down? Mom and Dad are waiting for us to eat.""

Just as I was focused on avoiding Aron, Maria urged me from behind. I remembered then, tomorrow is the Coming-of-Age Ceremony.

The day that turns everything upside down.

""I just lost my footing, almost fell. Coming down now.""

After going downstairs, the family sat around the dining table. Aron was also let in by Katherine to have breakfast together.

""Tomorrow is the Awakening Day, Aron. Are you nervous?""

Dylan casually teased while eating breakfast.

""He's not nervous at all! I believe Aron is the best!""

Maria flattered Aron somewhat ingratiatingly. Aron remained unmoved, just smiled slightly.

I focused on eating, paying no attention to them. In the past, I would probably have been full of self-pity. Now, I see things clearly. As long as they don't bother me, I'll let them be.

""Sarah, I'll take you and Maria to the market this afternoon to buy dresses. Tomorrow is a big day for your adulthood too. You need to wear something nice.""

Katherine, seeing that everyone had basically finished eating, got up to clear the dishes and discussed the afternoon plans with us.

""I won't go. Mom, you take Maria. I didn't sleep well last night, want to rest upstairs later. Can't attend tomorrow in poor condition, that would be disrespectful to the Moon Goddess.""

Katherine looked at me with some surprise. Perhaps because I was the child who returned home midway, I always lacked a sense of security. While I didn't necessarily need to stick to Katherine or Dylan every step, I also couldn't bear seeing them take Maria out alone.

Over time, Katherine got used to buying two of everything, always taking both out together.

Today's me, in their eyes, might indeed seem a bit反常.

Realizing something was off, I hurriedly made excuses for myself.

Dylan's inquiring gaze fell on me through the newspaper. I stood calmly where I was, accepting the scrutiny. I truly didn't sleep well last night, my mind constantly haunted by matters of my past life and... that pup.

""Mom, can I not go either? Just buy me that lake-blue gown back.""

Seeing I wasn't going, Maria also started acting spoiled, wanting to stay home.

I discreetly and quickly glanced at Aron.

Probably, Maria just wanted to spend more time alone with Aron.

Katherine pinched Maria's ear, warning her not to be too clever for her own good.

Then, to lure her out, Katherine thought for a moment and promised to buy her a piece of jewelry she liked.

This finally placated Maria, who was pouting with displeasure.

""Sarah, shall I get you a pearl necklace too?""

Katherine asked me from the stair landing before going out.

Lying on the bed, hearing this question, my heart felt warm.

Although Maria spent more time with our parents, Mom always remembered I am her child too.

But, a pearl necklace... I'm not really interested.

It seems because I'm a natural mage, compared to handicrafts, I prefer what nature directly gifts me.

""Mom, get me a pack of seeds instead. I haven't practiced magic for a long time, want to try again.""

Katherine agreed. I lay comfortably on my little room's bed, rolling back and forth, throwing out all the unhappiness from my memories.

Probably too tired, I fell asleep not long after.

In my drowsy state, I seemed to hear someone knocking. Was it Dylan?

I inexplicably excluded Aron from my considerations.

When I woke again, it was already dark. It was silent downstairs; I guessed Katherine and Maria hadn't returned yet.

That person... should be gone.

I breathed a sigh of relief, finally no need to be on edge. Wearing fluffy slippers, I clip-clopped downstairs to find something to eat.

Since I was alone at home, I simply let my nature loose, couldn't help but hum a woodland tune while rummaging through the kitchen cabinets to prepare some food.

It had been too long since I cooked in the old house's kitchen. I had no idea where any ingredients were, could only search while cooking.

After bumping my head on the wooden cabinet for the sixth time, I finally couldn't take it anymore, clenching my fists.

I'll tear this wooden cabinet out one day!

""Stupid, even cooking in your own home leaves you covered in injuries.""

A familiar voice suddenly sounded by my ear.

""What do you need? Milk or coffee beans?""

I instinctively stood up, moving away from the source of the voice.

How could I not recognize Aron's voice?

Before I could put distance between Aron and myself, my head unexpectedly bumped into the upper cabinet, but it didn't hurt as much as I imagined.

What happened?

My gaze followed upwards.

Aron's hand was positioned between me and the cabinet, now reddened from my reckless impact.

But he didn't make a sound, just quietly hid that hand behind his back.

""So, did you want milk or coffee beans?""

Aron stood in front of me, looking at me dumbly rooted to the spot, repeating the same question.

This time, his stare made me feel awkward. I wanted to flee but felt I was making a fuss over nothing.

Simply pretending to be calm, I stood my ground, met his gaze, steadied my voice and said,

""Coffee beans. Slept too much in the afternoon, got a headache. Since I can't sleep anyway, thought I'd brew some coffee and read some natural magic books tonight.""

Aron stared straight at me, his eyes filled with emotion I couldn't decipher.

""You're very different today. Did something happen?""

His next words caught me even more off guard.

I instinctively covered my unease, forced a slight curve of my lips, and quickly came up with an excuse.

""After all, tomorrow is the Awakening Day. Even though I've been prepared for a long time, the last day still makes me very nervous.""

He made a sound of acknowledgment but continued observing me from head to toe, trying to find my flaw.

""By the way, why are you here?""

I came up with a clumsy question, trying to cover up the previous loophole. Fortunately, Aron seemed to let me off and didn't press further.

He just, just raised his hand and opened the cabinet above us, took out the coffee beans inside, and handed them to me.

Then, he said offhandedly,

""I've been here all along. Never left.""

Another morning, same old story—

Big dreams brewing in faded glory.

Pour it hot, let the steam rise slow;

Maybe today we run the show.



World domination… or just a cup of coffee.

Grab a cup, sit for a while;

Don’t think too much—crave exile.

One minute you’re in heaven’s clutch,

The next you’re plain out of touch.



In light of the recent events,

You were soaked, almost bent.

Where there is no hope—sure descent;

You’re slipping fast, repent.





Tune in, cop out, let it go, drop out;

If you’re a star, you’re light-years away.

If you’re a dog, then you’re astray—

Stray, astray; either way you’re down.



I can tell by the way you flaunt your frown.

The chance is gone, you’re outta luck.

You’re pissed off, you don’t give a fuck.

It’s just the way to turn it down—

The weight, the load that holds you down.



And oh—

You say you’re fine but you’re barely standing,

Caught in the waves you never planned in.

And oh—

You think the world just turned its back,

But maybe it’s you who’s losing track…



Take your time, study the path,

See the mark, make the catch.

Secondary roads, quiet bypaths—

Difference between sure victory and bloodbath.



Come on, drop the funk and take a chair;

Static crackles through your wild hair.

Good vibes roll in from distant places—

Flip the script on everybody’s faces.



So raise your cup to the days ahead,

To every doubt you ever fed.

If the world won’t bend, just bend your view—

Dominate the moment that belongs to you.",1,1763836396.0,PoetryWritingClub,1,1.0,False

This week, I’ve been reflecting on social health — not just casual connections, but the deeper kind: presence, authenticity, and being truly seen. Life gets heavy. Trauma, stress, and loss can quietly build walls, yet sometimes the smallest moments spark profound change. 💛

I’m reminded of Anna Kendrick in Pitch Perfect, standing on stage, heart racing, facing fear head-on. Real presence demands bravery — in a conversation, a coffee, or a community event. Elon Musk reminds us to take the first step, even when unsure. And Charlie in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory shows the power of noticing the magic around us while staying humble and authentic.

Week 48 Social Goals:
1️⃣ Isolation 🕊️ — Show up fully: Attend one event and have a 2–3 minute undistracted conversation. 🌟
2️⃣ Fear of Vulnerability 💔 — Share one genuine thought or feeling with someone you trust. 💎
3️⃣ Community Drift 🌍 — Reconnect with one person for a short, intentional check-in. ☕🤝
4️⃣ Emotional Exhaustion 😓 — Choose one energizing social interaction and skip one draining one. ⚖️💛
5️⃣ Misaligned Energy ⚡ — Spend 30 minutes in a space that uplifts your energy. 🌿✨

Unified Week 48 Intention:
“I will have one meaningful, undistracted conversation — showing up authentically, protecting my energy, and choosing connection over isolation.”

Channel the courage of Anna Kendrick, the boldness of Elon Musk, the wonder of Charlie, and the guidance of mentors and moments that shaped you — Erika Kirk, Kalin Blanchard, Blue 35, Emily. Small acts become turning points. Social health isn’t about being more social — it’s about being more present, more real, more alive. 🚪💛

1p40jj8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p40jj8,26M Let's skip planning on destination and start enjoying the journey together.,"(Posting this again because my old account  got deleted)

Looking for my moonpie(cute reference from young Sheldon)to love her more than me.


Hey,Tamil CF guy here let me tell about me.
I'm 26 years young who was just rebellious to prove my cf decision(having child is a personal choice so I fought with them to respect my personal choice also by sharing the reasons why I took cf decision)to my parents and got their approval. An avid trekker, backpacking to everest in July, CA by education but into business and investments (I read annual reports like comics)for satisfaction. An adventure junkie sometimes I find skydiving soothed me than anything else. Based in coimbatore and salem rn(Tier 2 city with Bangalore like weather). Learning paragliding for quite sometime along with my renewed interest in surfing. Apart from travel I love baking and cooking (except dishwashing part),I play PC games a lot. (Apex legends>valorant)
Friends say my pizza is way more better than domino's. Decathlon is the place where I love to go when I feel tired or drained. Love working out and hitting the gym. I'm a guy who believes in God but not in rituals. My religion is love and compassion(born as hindu) and ethics. Financially I'm well stable and sufficient enough to support my travel goals and a comfortable lifestyle and have no debts. Things that I wish that you should know is I travel for atleast 150 days in a year. I love writing poetry for my partner.(have a collection of 100 already). I live alone and not staying with my parents and this is gonna continue in future too.(because of my ventures otherwise they're sweet people)
I chose CF lifestyle because of health risks of my partner, my purpose of life and travel goals.(I'm more of purpose driven guy than a goal chaser)
Some points that may make my post interesting are 
1) I follow strict skin care routine(almost a pro these days)
2)solo travelled and hiked all the major peaks of western ghats. Completed Hampta pass and lakes of kashmir trek too.
3) I have never drank alcohol or had a cigarette 
4) Planning (started doing now)for an all India food trip next year in 7 stages.
5) I'm planning and aiming for a wingsuit license in future.
6) Diesel head and love road trips a lot next to adventure activities. 
7) Books and newspapers are necessity for me.
8) Good food and coffee makes me happy.
9) All things that I love starts with letter S like sun(I love sunrise and sunset so i always try to not miss them),snow,skydiving,sky,stars,space,sea, even name of people I love and value starts with s.(so if your name starts with S you'll be new to this silly list but you'll be at the top of the list)

Some philosophy that I follow:

1) We all are just actors on the stage called earth directed by god, we don't know we wud go to hell or heaven after death So let us live our own fairytale on this heaven without any regrets.

2)Intentions over the actions(good action with bad intentions is worse than bad action with good intent)

3)cute gifts, appreciations,touch and healthy adjustments brings happiness every now and then which makes a relationship wholesome.

If you love travel and snow then you'll find my post interesting, believe me I will be more interesting in person as have lots of stories and surprises to share.

Last but not the least I have decided to be a childfree person throughout my life and there is no going back and I'm serious in my life choices. I'm looking for a CF partner who is firm in her decision.


Preferences ::
Age - 21-27

Location - India(If you're Tamil,Then I think my Tamil poetry needs no translation)

CF choice - no fence sitters


 The person should love to travel and emotionally available. For me trust and loyalty is the core basement of the relationship(I hate lying to loved ones even if it is very little one). Social drinking and smoking is ok(I'm ok with my sodas at the parties). The person should be into self care both mentally and physically.(I'm 5'6 and quite athletic build body type, I never miss my workouts) Also expect the person to believe selflove and mental health is important too.I expect my partner to respect my choices (my family is a vegetarian  but they respect my meat eating choices).I'm ok with long distance relationship and as of now I can't relocate because of my business nature I don't have flexibility to shift permanently as of now. I travel for 15 - 20 days continuously and concentrate on business for a month after it so consider whether my travelling style will suit you(can be changed for your convenience too)If you have any more questions I wud try to answer in dms(I'm sort of ambivert and love my privacy so even I installed instagram only in November) if you're an adventure junkie, don't hold back just message me we can atleast discuss a trip.

I can salvage/reuse the copper and curtains for other projects, but am wondering if the look is okay and if I should just buy more curtains for the other windows.

1p40cqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1p40cqt/postop_cholecystectomy_experience/,Post-Op Cholecystectomy Experience,"This community helped me so much leading up to my surgery that I wanted to pay it forward by sharing a bit about my experience so far post-op, in hopes that it helps someone else. 

tldr: it was successful and I do not regret it at the post 5 day mark. 

Quick history: 48f, increasing instances and pain from attacks over the last year. However, I suspect I had my first attack, brought on by stress and a terrible diet, over 20 years ago, which was then misdiagnosed as an ulcer. Never had problems again until the past couple of years, likely brought on by weight loss once I got my hormones right after entering menopause. I had a pretty bad attack this past September, my PCP ordered an ultrasound + bloodwork. My gallbladder, code name Gertie, was infected and my liver enzymes were elevated. Met with a surgeon for consult in October, scheduled surgery for this past Monday (lapro / outpatient), so here I am 5 days out. 

The anticipation of the surgery was more nerve wracking than the actual procedure. I was in for prep at the surgery center at 7:45AM; first hour was spent in the waiting room. Once they called me back, they asked me to undress, give a urine sample (um, the annoyance of having to insist there’s no way you could be pregnant because your post-meno, amirite folks with uteri?), get into the gown, get into bed. The nurse gave me a little something to relax me. The anesthesiologist visited and got some info from me, told me what he would be doing and giving me, asked if I had any questions. I may or may not have asked if he was single because he was cute. The nurse assisting with the surgery came in, rolled me back to the surgery room, helped me move from the bed to the table. Anesthesiologist worked his magic and I woke up what I now know was maybe 45 minutes later. 

The waking from the anesthesia was the most difficult part of the whole experience for me - it’s just the way you suddenly wake up out of time and sense, and of course I had to cry a little. Thankfully my sister was with me and they allowed her back to hold my hand and help me calm down. I think I was in recovery for maybe a half hour before they asked me if I felt like I could stand. I could, my sister helped me get dressed, and we drove home. 

I only took the pain meds the first couple of days, mostly to sleep. I have not taken them since Wednesday. I managed any discomfort with the tylenoyl/advil flip throughout the day(s). As a side sleeper, I was able to sleep comfortably on my left side with the support of a body pillow. I alternated an icepack and heating pad every so often. I was not ever nauseated and have not needed the nausea meds they prescribed at all. I also took a stool softener every day in case things needed a little encouragement on that end thanks to anesthesia / pain meds. Had first bm Thursday morning. I had the infamous gas pain, but for me, it was only a little pain here and there in my right shoulder. The inner 12-year-old boy in me really appreciated all the burps and farts, although laughing was kinda hard at first. 

I work remotely, but took Monday (day of the procedure) and Tuesday off, “returning” to work on Wednesday, able to sit at my desk comfortably. I ate mainly homemade vegetable soup my mom made for me (it’s one of my favorite of her dishes and I requested a batch for recovery), but I ate a soft taco (homemade with lean meat, red cabbage, and a drizzle of sour cream sauce) on Wednesday with no problems. Last night, I had salad and a ground beef / potato casserole my sister made, which also had a good bit of cheese in it. No problems at all, other than I’m learning that I have to keep my portions low (not a problem, since I was already doing that thanks to Gertie’s antics and the fight against menopausal weight gain). I feel like I fill up faster so far post-op, so that’s something to keep an eye on. I have not had any problems drinking two cups of coffee every morning, even with my signature splash of half and half. 

The most painful thing right now, and it’s not even painful really, just something I’m aware of, is that when I breathe in deeply, I get a kind of hitch in my right side, about where Gertie used to reside. It started at day 3 and has lessened, almost barely perceptible today. My incisions itch a little, but nothing that a little lotion / Vaseline doesn’t help. I have four: one near the diaphragm, one in the navel, two small on the right side of my torso. I don’t expect they’ll give me any trouble as they heal, and they are so small I doubt any scars will be noticeable. 

I wanted to share all of this because folks are rightfully afraid of the bad experiences others post here. I was too, not gonna lie about that, and I know that folks have bad experiences and need space to vent and process them. Totally valid. Y’all keep doing that and this community is gonna keep supporting for sure! 

But I do want to gently say this: reflect on your constitution and what you know about yourself and your own body to help you prepare. We’re all different and will respond differently to these procedures. It also matters if someone is admitted for emergency surgery vs. a planned, “elective” procedure. I don’t expect to be fully recovered by next week, I know it will take time, but I also know I won’t be having the same haul as someone who had emergency surgery or needed an extended hospital stay post-op. 

I am relatively fit, thanks to kicking up my attention to fitness and diet once I hit menopause. I’m not even crazy about it (mainly was lifting light a couple of days a week, lots of walking, hot yoga, and some calisthenics stuff I stagger on my breaks throughout the day because I work from home). I watch what I eat, mainly being conditioned by Gertie to do that to avoid attacks, but also because my metabolism slowed to a crawl when I hit my mid-40s. I am finally at a healthy weight for my height after some years of struggling a bit. I had hints of how I might react to anesthesia from other procedures (wisdom teeth cut out at 19, colonoscopy at 45). I think reflecting on all of this helped me mentally prepare myself for what would be my likely outcome, and just knowing that gave me some comfort. Plus a great family support system. Even if you suspect that you might have issues, say with nausea if you know it always makes you nauseous, then at least you can prepare for that - and possibly be pleasantly surprised if what you expect doesn’t happen. At least, that’s my hope for all of you who are nervous and scared.

Best of luck to you all. RIP Gertie the Gallbladder! ",2,1763835881.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

1p40bb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1p40bb7/is_there_still_hope/,Is there still hope?,"So I met this girl during our college day thing where we just met other freshmen and teachers for our first semester of college which was September 19th. I saw this girl who looked like my brother’s girlfriend’s cousin. I never met her just saw a couple pictures. I went to her and asked if she knew my brother’s girlfriend and then we hit it off. She was a quiet, introverted girl who was smart and very pretty. In 2-3 days later she friended me on snap, we went on a date a week later. It was a good date and she seemed to like me then we went on a couple more dates. About three weeks later, we kissed and started officially dating. She told me that I was her first crush, first boyfriend, and first kiss. Then she asked me if I wanted to go to her lake house with her entire family. I said yes of course and I had a great time. At this point of the relationship I really started liking her and we made out a good bit. She was so sweet and kind.She told me her secrets and I told her mine. She has siblings but they’re a lot older than her, so she basically grew up as an only child. Her dad and mom were also not home much because of work much so she usually became more independent as a child. During our lake house trip I felt like I understood her more and noticed that she got stressed out easily and I tried to calm her down most of the time. I think that was about the time I fell in love with her. I think her family really liked me.Then after the trip we went on a few more dates. Then for the final week of summer until I had to go to college for pre-season, I would help her take care of her niece and nephew. They were so cute. Then I couldn’t see her for a week because of preseason which I was cool with. But this is when things go south.

So she is trying to become a dentist and have her own dental clinic. So I know that she really wanted to do well in school. I am trying to become a physical therapist major. During school she became a different person she seemed a lot more stressed out and never really tried to make time for us. We had very similar class structures and had two labs together and two classes together. During the breaks we had in between classes I wanted to take a break and relax in my room while she wanted to study or do homework outside or at the library. Sometimes she would go into my room but most of the time she would go and study. I should have just went to my room and gave her space but I wanted to hangout with her, so I just would be with her and kinda of complained about being there(I was joking about it for the most part but it started to get on her nerves). She would get easily irritated and asked why I even wanted to hangout with her? I always said because I loved being around her which was true. She was also a commuter so I couldn’t really get to see her after 3 pm which sucked because she would go lift with her friend and then would leave. I asked if she wanted to workout with me but she said no and that was the only time she got to hangout with her friend. She also just wasn’t a big fan of texting a lot, so I expressed my feelings that we have to talk either by text or FaceTiming at night. She wanted to FaceTime so we did. There were days when she slept over at her friend’s dorm and we would hangout for 10 minutes and then she would go back to her friend. There was times where I acted like a child like saying loudly in the library I want to hear you say you love me back and I always wanted a kiss from her. I always walked her to her class first thing in the morning and I always wanted a kiss even if people were there but I knew she didn’t like PDA and I didn’t really like it either so we talked about it and said we could kiss when we last saw each other but sometimes she just wouldn’t kiss me. I should have just been fine with anything even if she didn’t kiss me. Then at this point her grades weren’t as good as she wanted them to be. One day she was really stressed out and came to my room just to relax and snuggle and talk about her feelings. Then we were about to be on our three month anniversary so I planned a date to go play pickleball and then dinner somewhere and said we could take a shower together(jokingly) but I said it multiple times which was so stupid and creepy. and then we argued about why she would feel more comfortable calling a hypothetical spanish guy that she dated for three months, papi. She is Columbian and I am Asian and white and made me feel inadequate. I told her my feelings about it and she understood. I also explained that she hasn’t been making any time for me and feels like she doesn’t want to kiss me anymore and some more things. She said she understood and just said that school has been really stressful and that she doesn’t really like kissing as much as I do(which I took that as she doesn’t find me sexually attractive). She said that we will talk about this more after our class. She texted me to meet somewhere and she broke up with me. She said, you’re right I haven’t been very invested in our relationship and you deserve better. School will always come before us and I think that’s very unfair to you. So I think it would be best if we broke up. I responded saying if that’s what you want and left the room. I asked her to talk the next day to ask why she broke up with me and she said because she’s really stressed out about school and she can’t juggle a relationship and school. She said I was a really good boyfriend and I deserve someone better. I asked her if she still liked me and she said yes. I asked her why we couldn’t work things out then and she said I just can’t do it right now. I also asked if she ever found me sexually attractive and she never answered. Then in our lab the next day I treated it as though we were still dating and said that I would get her back in 6 weeks. It’s been about a week and two months. I cried a good amount after I realized we broke up but I still had a good amount of hope that she’ll come back if I listen to what chat gpt says to do which was treat her friendly but not too friendly and let her talk sometimes. I moved seats in class but I kept being her lab partner in both our labs. Then following what chat GPT says for two months she seemed to be a little more comfortable and asked me about classes, makes jokes to me, asked me for help in labs, make eye contact with me, laughed at me, and kinda treated me like she used to. But she never asked me any personal questions about my life. But I still insisted on asking her to coffee this week as to see whether she still wanted to try something. She hesitantly said no with an awkward smile and now I’m really suffering. She said that we shouldn’t go to coffee together and that I don’t even like coffee. I can’t focus on anything anymore and just think about her. I’m now using a different Ai system and also am asking my dad to see what he thinks. The winter break is about to be here and our classes are going to be different so it will be a lot easier to do no contact for a while. But I still want to talk to her and I still love her. And I’m scared if I don’t reach out and she doesn’t reach out I’ll never get to talk to her again. Do I wait until the summer to reach out or should I wait for her to reach out? Is there any hope left or should I just move on. ",1,1763835790.0,BreakUps,4,1.0,False

I saw my cat tapping on something and sniffing it. As I got closer I saw there was something running around in circles and my cat keeps tapping on it, but it keeps getting away. 

The way it was moving I could say it is a spider! Eventually the spider went under a low profile coffee table, but my cat was not giving up! She was circling the table reaching under table with her paws. 

I got a cup and paper for the first time in my life… removed the table and the spider had their front legs high up in the air! My cat was about to tap it again but I put the cup over it. 

The spider kept running around in the cup so I couldn’t take a good picture. But I released it in the wild. I think the spider has a web just by our door and accidentally got in.

1/2 cup real powdered milk

6 tbsp powdered sugar (Florida Crystals if you’ve got it)

2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder 

1/2 tsp ground cinnamon (optional)

1/8 tsp sea salt

1/2 tsp vanilla powder (or skip and add real vanilla extract to your mug when serving)

Instructions

 

Combine:

Add all ingredients to a bowl and stir until well mixed.

Optional – Make it ultra-smooth:

Pulse in a blender or food processor for 15–20 seconds until the mixture is fine and uniform. 

This helps it dissolve faster and gives it that creamy, café texture.

Store:

Pour into a small airtight jar or tin. Label and date it.

To Serve:

Add 2–3 tablespoons of mix to a mug.

Pour in 6–8 oz of hot water (not boiling).

Stir well.

Top with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cocoa or cinnamon if you’re feeling fancy.

She then accused me of cheating on her because I wasn’t responding and because the person who interviewed me was a lesbian! They are in a polycule, by the way, and have never invited me to it, so I see no issue. But my girlfriend realized I gave the W-4 to the lesbian interviewer filled out as “single”, and my girlfriend blew up! She accused me of cheating on her and trying to pretend I was single.

I question all my life choices.,"I'm a junior dev, and last week I was tasked with updating a feature in our legacy system. It seemed simple enough, just adding a new parameter. I pushed the change, and then all hell broke loose. The entire module started throwing a cryptic, nonsensical error. Naturally, panic set in.

I spent the next two days in a personal debugging hell. I was mainlining coffee, my eyes were burning from staring at the screen, and I had about 50 Stack Overflow tabs open. I went through every line of my code, then every line of the old code. I checked the database connection, the API calls, everything. I even started to suspect a cosmic ray had flipped a bit on our server. I roped in my senior dev, and even he was scratching his head, which made me feel both better and infinitely worse.

The deadline was breathing down my neck. Defeated, late on a Friday, I was just numbly scrolling through the code one last time before giving up for the weekend. My eyes were so blurry I could barely read, but then something caught my attention. It was a single character in a massive config file I hadn't even touched. A semicolon, sitting there smugly where a comma was supposed to be.

My heart stopped. It couldn't be that simple, could it? I held my breath, deleted the semicolon, typed a comma, and saved. The build passed. The feature worked perfectly. A 48-hour, soul-crushing bug was fixed by a single keystroke. I felt a tidal wave of relief, immediately followed by the hollow feeling of being the dumbest person alive. My senior just laughed and told me to go get a beer.
