1rbibk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1rbibk6/taipei_travel_tips/,Taipei travel tips?,"Hi all,

My girlfriend & I will be visiting Taiwan, Taipei to be specific, in late March. I’m trying to figure out where to stay, and have a few questions:

1. What district would you recommend a stay in? In our late 20s, and would like to be in a lowkey, hip area that’s also somewhat central to everything. We’re not into the party scene, but also want to go to some craft beer/brewery spots. I’ve been seeing Zhongshan as a good spot, but not likely some of the hotels in the area.

2. What are some of your favorite cafes in Taipei? My girlfriend is a coffee snob, so hoping to find some good roasteries. 

3. Can you recommend some of your favorite hidden gem restaurants? Will definitely try a few of the must haves, but I always love to go to a few spots that locals love that may not be as well known when I travel.

4. Any good breweries? We love some good IPAs, and love trying local beersZ

5. What are some nice places to go on walks? 

Any other tips or do-nots that you may have, please do let me know! Thanks :)",1,1771755411.0,taiwan,0,1.0,False

I could tell there was chemistry but due to nature of the encounter, I wasn't sure If I should approach her (we work for the same company but completely different divisions and have never met her before) but after the conference I get a message from her asking for my social media and number. I thought she was making it clear that she felt something to.

We chat for several hours and it was super obvious she was interested( love reacted most of my texts, sent me a voice message asking me out for coffee, told me her work schedule and where she worked) and she asked when I was free. I told her there was a strong chance we could make it work depending on when I got off work and she was responded to let her know with hearts and smileys. I thought she was trying to make it obvious. I've never had a women lay it all out like that before.

Next day I message her asking if she had made plans because I was going to be in her area and I get no response. It appears my text wasn't even read.

There is always the chance she had an emergency or issues with her phone, but the fact that we planned it out was a huge bummer. Even just a quick ""I had something come up"" would have been cool, but man this hurt as I thought it was 100% going to happen.

I am highly disappointed and can't sleep. I am so attracted to this lady and I got along with her so well, like I've never felt that before with a person and now my mind is thinking every scenario.

Its hard to be happy for any amount of time when you know in the back of your head its all temporary. I hate to catastrophize but every date or relationship I have ever had has eventually failed, and it would be nice for things to go well for once.

I know I just met her, but you would think that once you get into your later 20s and early 30s that people would start to be a little more thoughtful and more reliable. I hate being so easily affected by this. I consider myself a pretty resilient person but these kind of scenarios make me feel deeply sad.

Aonami Shizuka

“

I want to be under different skies, but I don’t want to be under them without her.

— To herself

”

⸻

OVERVIEW

SHIZUKA is a very intelligent girl. She goes to Shiketsu High and she’s one of those people that is smart but doesn’t apply herself and still makes good grades. She would be at the top of her class if she would just try, but she doesn’t see the point most of the time. She’s already one of the smartest students without barely putting in any effort.

She’s constantly bored and likes to imagine the places she could go someday. She wants to be a traveler when she gets older and see different countries and skies, but her family pressured her into becoming a hero instead.

She is one of three identical triplets, though she doesn’t like being compared to her sisters.

⸻

BASIC INFORMATION

Full Name: Aonami Shizuka

Kanji Name: **青波** **静**

Romaji Name: Aonami Shizuka

Alias(es): Blue Shift

Birthday: July 9

Age: 16

Gender: Female

Height: 5 foot four

Hair Color: black or a deep shade of blue that passes for black with cyan blue undertones

Eye Color: grey (glows cyan when her quirk is active)

Blood Type: O

Birthplace: Osaka, Japan

Status: Alive

Occupation: Shiketsu High student

Affiliation: Shiketsu

Family:

Aonami Yoruha (mother)

Unnamed father

Aonami Amaya (triplet sister, UA)

Aonami Kuromi (triplet sister, UA)

⸻

APPEARANCE

SHIZUKA is average height with an average body size. She has long waist-length blue-black hair with a cyan peekaboo underneath in the back. She keeps her hair down, and she has soft straight bangs. She also has a small beauty mark under her left eye.

Her eyes are naturally grey, but when she uses her quirk they glow a bright cyan blue.

Hero Costume:

She wears a fitted bodysuit that is mostly white with black accents and resembles a compression suit. It has subtle cyan seam lines running through it, and she wears knee-high boots that help her stay stable after teleporting. The design gives a slight astronaut vibe without being bulky.

Civilian Outfit:

Oversized hoodies, crop tops, high-waisted skirts, and ankle boots. She drinks iced coffee even in the winter.

Her grey eyes and blue-black hair with cyan underneath are her most defining features.

⸻

PERSONALITY

She is confident in herself but can be very harsh on others. She lacks motivation most of the time but will call people out with little hesitation, so much so that people call her cruel. She’s self-assured, witty, and blunt.

Strengths: intelligent, observant, calm under pressure

Flaws: overconfident, slacker, headstrong, emotionally avoidant

The only thing that motivates her in the morning is coffee. Everything else feels like a chore.

She secretly listens to the band Starset to practice her English but doesn’t really tell anyone that.

She has a soft spot for one particular person outside of her family, but she refuses to admit it.

⸻

ABILITIES

Fighting Style: surprise attacks and tactical repositioning.

Quirk: Seam

Seam allows Shizuka to fold space by creating thin fractures called seams. Instead of opening a normal portal, she forces two points in space to briefly overlap so she can step across instantly.

When a seam forms, it gives off a faint cyan glow caused by a Cherenkov-like radiation effect from the sudden spatial displacement. The glow is thin and controlled, almost like a cut in the air.

When she activates her quirk, her eyes glow cyan because her body is synchronizing with the spatial distortion.

She can teleport:

	•	Herself

or

	•	A single object she is touching

She cannot teleport both at the same time.

Drawbacks include severe headaches if overused and temporary disorientation. She also has to be touching a surface to activate it.

⸻

STATS

Power: 3

Speed: 5

Technique: 6

Wits: 5

Intelligence: 5

Cooperativeness: 2

⸻

EQUIPMENT

Her hero suit is made out of a special material that can handle the stress of spatial folding. Her boots are reinforced so she can land properly after displacement.

⸻

MAJOR EVENTS

SHIZUKA is one of three identical triplets born to her mother and raised in a loud household. Her family struggles financially, and there’s a lot of drama.

Her two sisters went to UA to get away and pursue bigger opportunities, but SHIZUKA stayed close to home to help her mom. She takes part-time jobs when she can.

Her bad attitude has gotten her into trouble in both middle school and high school. She doesn’t get along with her peers and is often considered a mean girl.

She has a crush on someone who constantly tries to matchmake her with other people, which only annoys her more.

⸻

TRIVIA

She has a Samoyed dog.

Her last name Aonami means Blue Wave.

Her first name Shizuka means silence or calmness.

She loves anything sweet and constantly drinks frozen Frappuccinos.

She never lets food go to waste and will steal food from other people’s plates.

She drinks iced coffee even in winter.

I have to say, I was rather surprised, Hoyo is indeed a much fuller and satisfying cigar than the previous line blend. The flavours of toasted cedar, coffee, vanilla , and roasted tobacco ( what I describe a lighter but chewy tobacco flavor ) are as per the old blend but taken from a 3 to a 6 or even 7. 

Is that due to changes in agricultural practices in Cuba? And in turn limitation in how light the Cuba’s can make some of their blend? Or is it due to an intentions blend change in response to market demand? I don’t think anyone outside Habanos SA can say for sure, though I would speculate the former is the case if I were to make a wild guess.

Remember those old video games? They would say, ""I'll tell you when I've had enough caffeine."" And the people at the ""cafe"" would say, ""we're going to call your wife and tell her to get you to come home from this coffee shop."" And the really ""caffeinated"" man would say, I'll tell you when I've had enough caffeine. Give me another coffee.""



So, yeah, bear in mind I was under the influence of ""caffeine"".



And I said to my friend: I'm hesitant to use the L word, you don't want to use the word love... cuz you got to be careful not to love bomb people. It's good to express love and what I'm saying is coming from the heart. I really appreciate friendship and it's great to have a good friend... and sometimes friendship is better than a romantic partner because relationships can be fleeting and friendships are forever.



Obviously everybody wants a romantic relationship for the obvious reasons too and that takes things to the next level. Take everything slowly.



I think when things have been bad for so long and you meet someone who's genuine and loving, you want to let them know you appreciate them, but try not to be overbearing and don't love bomb. Also, don't be desperate. People come and go in life.



I remember I had a friend and I really appreciated her friendship and I was crying thanking her for her friendship. But yeah, men don't cry. I understand things have been tough, but she looked at me like, ""What should I do?""



As much as you want to get emotional, sometimes it's better to keep it to yourself because... Yeah.



I realize when life's been hard you want to cry and love bomb... but people come and go in life.





Now, I'm going to describe some artwork.



The first one, I see a pop superstar in New York City. I'm just a fan. I'm a wannabe. And I say, ""Oh my god, it's a pop superstar. Can I have your autograph?""



Maybe in my early 20s, I was impressed by pop stars. But now, as I'm approaching 38 years old, I'm not really impressed by pop superstars all that much. They're just people who go to the bathroom just like you and I. They're just people.





And the next artwork that I created yesterday is Mama Carrot with her kids.



You see the vegetable minds, the mama carrot with her two, I guess maybe it's a son and daughter? or maybe two sons? And the kid says to Mama Carrot, ""Protect me from the rabbit.""



And Mama Carrot says to the kids, ""The bunny won't hurt us.""

She eventually caved but had done so on the basis he was the one looking after it. I wasn’t sure this was a great idea but it’s not my child so what can I say.

For the first couple months he seemed to be doing a pretty good job for a 7 year old. I go round most weeks at least once for dinner, or for a coffee, so I got to see this hamster pretty regularly. He was always playing with the hamster, feeding it, showing it off. It was always out the cage running round in the ball or the kid was holding it.

Around a month ago though the kids interest ran out as I warned my friend it would. Whenever I went round I started to notice that he was never playing with it, barely even mentioned it. The cage was often dirty, looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in days, the water was low, barely any food. I brought it up a couple times to my friend just asking if her son was still interested in the thing. She laughed it off and said she told him it was his responsibility and clearly the novelty had worn off. I tried to push the subject checking the thing was at least being taken care of. I understand the sentiment of ‘it’s yours so take care of it’ but at the end of the day he’s 7. And you are the responsible adult that bought the living thing so at least feed and clean it. But every time it was brushed off. Don’t get me wrong the hamster wasn’t dead so it was clearly getting some food and water but even she admitted that she wouldn’t take it out it’s cage as it kind of freaked her out.

The last time I went round which was a couple days ago the same thing was happening. Food bowl practically empty, water empty, filthy cage. And maybe I’m a bit neurotic for noticing but the hamster ball it plays in was in the same exact spot shoved in the cabinet so I assume it hasn’t even been out the cage. Asked the son lightly about the hamster and he sighed like it was such a chore to even think about him. The poor thing was just sat there in its cage. No enrichment whatsoever.

So I took the hamster, but technically it wasn’t theft. I spoke to my friends husband privately and said if his sons no longer interested in the hamster I can take it off them, as my niece is looking to get one. He even agreed with me saying his son barely even looks at it and it’s easier for all of them as him and his wife have no time to do anything with it, barely have enough time to clean its cage. So he dropped it round my house 4 days ago after work (he WFH so was when my friend and her son were out the house).

Now 2 days ago my friend called me furious screaming at me that I stole her sons ‘precious pet’ and how could I do that and demanding it back immediately. Obviously she had noticed and her husband admitted I had taken it. I explained to her that her husband agreed and considering it’s taken her almost 2 days to even notice the hamsters missing it’s probably for the best. Now all our friends are picking sides all over this hamster, it feels ridiculous. I won’t be giving the hamster back regardless as my niece now has it and is taking 10x better care of it, I guess I’m just looking for some validation that I’m not crazy.

Hi everyone,

I'm 34 (M, only if that matters to you) and interested in nature, technology, and culture. I even have an annual pass for Berlin museums. I live in Neukölln and speak fluent German, English, and French.

I work out (or at least I'm trying to 😂) two to three times a week at John Reed (Schönleinstr.). In the summer, I'm often at Tempelhofer Feld. One of my summer rituals is to cycle several laps around the field at sunset and then treat myself to a cold drink in the Tempelgarten.

    I'm looking for relaxed, open-minded people in Berlin who are interested in doing things together, whether it's working out at the gym, going to events, or simply having a good chat over coffee or tea.
    
    Honesty, humor, and mutual respect are important to me. So if you'd like to make new friends and do things together, feel free to message me!
    
    
    Please, no AfD supporters, xenophobic individuals, or radicals.

When I watched them leaving for the ride, I couldn’t help myself wondering how’s it feels like and where they’d go? 

It was quite a busy time for me when I was there, had a queue waiting and I even ran out of my regular milks. There was a guy caught my eyes who bought a large vanilla latte and a large flat white for another guy. He’s pretty tanned and maybe even look a little red and handsome? Probably also introverted like me lol. I can’t remember other details as I was so concentrate on finishing the queue but somehow that something about him just stays in my mind.

A few facts about me:

* I love reading and writing stories. If we date, you *will* be analyzed like a fictional character. It’s affectionate, I promise.
* Certified introvert. My ideal night involves books, deep talks, and not yelling over music.
* Not big on going out. If your love language is crowded clubs…I'm probably not your type
* I’m an INFJ. So yes… patterns, patterns everywhere. I don’t mean to run social experiments, but sometimes my brain… collects data.

Who I’m looking for:

  
Confident. Smart. Driven. I admire someone who sets goals and actually achieves them. There’s something incredibly attractive about competence. I love the idea of looking at you and thinking, “Wow. I need to level up.”

A naturally dominant presence (calm, not chaotic). Someone who can lead without shouting about it. Strong backbone, clear direction, but also capable of switching into softness when it matters. 

If you’re ambitious, emotionally intelligent, and not intimidated by a slightly intense, pattern-detecting introvert who drinks too much coffee… we might work; effort matters.

If we vibe, I’d love to upgrade from Wi-Fi chemistry to real-life eye contact.

1rbhngv,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1rbhngv/today_marks_90th_day/,Today marks 90th day.,"30M

Today is Day 90 since she left me. Today I took time for myself to look back at how I supported myself for last 90 days, I want to thank myself for not doing self harm, not resorting to alcohol or self-destructive habits. I am sometimes angry at her for leaving me. I wear her shirts and I keep her favorite handkerchief with myself, preserved. 


The pain has definitely become bearable than it was for first 60 days. I still find things of her that have a close memory. The things that I associate with plans I had with her - our coffee machine, our fridge, her gym clothes, her birthday dresses, her expensive heels, her set of 'good' crockery and everything else. I still live in same rented house I shared with her. It's become more bearable to live now. 



I still feel alone thinking of her beautiful smile, the way she used to talk to me in her baby voice, the way she used to laugh at my jokes, having hot beverages with her after a day in office, picking her up after office and dropping her to nearest public transport. I miss being goofy at her. I miss her getting annoyed at my annoying habits. 



But all of that together kept aside, I am glad that pain is bearable. I still get breakdowns but I stopped therapy after 3 sessions. It wasn't working out for me. Good thing is that frequency of breakdowns has reduced. On the brighter side, I no longer hope to die in sleep peacefully like she did, and I can see myself living. 



Things would have been happier had she been around. Sometimes I am glad that she doesn't have to live through my death. This is such a horrible phase of life and she would be in so much pain. World would not have been nice to her, but she would have still fought like a warrior had I died. But since it's not my reality, hence I'll stop that thought. 


Bottom line I am glad I survived till Day 90. I am sure I'll live further as well. Thanks to this sub for helping me in journey so far. ",2,1771752962.0,widowers,0,1.0,False
1rbhmu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1rbhmu0/my_girlfriend_is_a_zombie_part_2/,My Girlfriend Is A Zombie (Part 2),"There was another such day that left me feeling even more conflicted..

The day wasn’t anything out of the ordinary. I got home, dumped my bag by the door, got interrupted by Frankie’s ‘Welcome home’ kiss while trying to lock the door, and sat by the kitchen counter to go over the notes I’d taken from my day at uni; all typical, nerdy Opal Braeburn things. It doesn’t make for the most exciting story, but it’s real. It’s me. 

Anyways, let me get back to the story before I get distracted by trying to convince you that I’m not a total loser.

The Sun begins to gently set—painting the sky in colours of orange and burnt sienna. Frankie was sitting on the couch watching some show. The name escapes me whenever I try to recall it, so you’ll have to ask her what it was if you’re curious. 

I closed my notebook with a soft sigh, feeling satisfied with my level of revision, though in hindsight it was likely just me being lazy. After casting my notebook to the side, I began slicing bread for a guilty snack; guilty because I’d ordered an ice cream from one of my universities cafeterias before coming home. My attention was caught by Frankie, let out a short yawn while stretching across the couch.

Though it shames me to share this in a public story, something about Frankie drew me in during that moment. Perhaps it was due to my fatigue, perhaps it was how she was laid in an almost suggestive manner—but that was, I believe, the first time I’d noticed my strange tendencies as an unordinary person.

You see, most people don’t look at a half-undead frankenstein and wonder how their lips taste, or how it would feel to run their fingers across the seams and stitches running across their face, or how her blood-red hair would look the morning after-

My thoughts were put on an abrupt pause by a sharp, throbbing sting snaking across my finger. You guessed it, I was an idiot and cut myself. 

“S-shit!” I exclaimed, followed by the sound of me sucking air through my teeth. Must’ve been pretty loud too because Frankie’s head darted towards my direction like a moth to a flame; though this moth is a zombie that calls herself Frankie, and the flame is the vexation I have towards my inability to multitask.

“What’s wrong?” she asked—half concerned, half startled. Frankie’s never liked sudden loud sounds.

I didn’t answer immediately, instead wanting to assess what I’d actually done to myself before speaking. My hand gently cupped my finger. As suspected, I cut myself. The cut wasn’t the kind that required medical attention or anything, but it was pretty deep, and it hurt like a…well..I can’t think of an accurate simile, but the point is that it hurt. My finger throbbed where the newly-opened gash had formed, and thick blood rushed to escape the wound. 

By this point Frankie had already gotten up and rushed to my side. 

“It’s nothing” I lie. “I just cut myself a little while cutting some bread”

Frankie took my hand with a gentleness that had been practiced over the many months of us dating. Not too hard, but assertive enough to emphasise her concern. She looked down at my bleeding finger with a mix of relief and worry—the kind of look you give when you almost forget you’re sad, but remember halfway through.

She looked up at me with almost glassy eyes. 

“Does it hurt?” She asked innocently. I almost wanted to be a smart-ass and say *what do you think*, or something along those lines. I caught myself though, knowing that she was merely concerned. And god I loved her for that. That pure, unfiltered worry she always had whenever something like this happened—my secret reaffirmation that Frankie really did love me.

I assured her that it was merely a scratch and that I’d be fine, but the bleeding said otherwise. The fact that I’m still wearing a bandage while writing this is proof enough that it wasn’t just a scratch. 

“It’s fine Franks, I’ll just clean it with-“ I didn’t get the chance to finish my sentence, or thought for that matter. In some..strange way of taking care of me, in a way that is sooo her, Frankie took hold of my hand and slid my finger into her mouth.

Saying I was taken aback would be an understatement. That’s not something most people do right? My body froze, and a tingle shot like lightning through my body as I felt Frankie’s heavy tongue wrap around my finger. I let out a sound somewhere between a gasp, a squeak, and a whimper—and my ears burned in a brilliant red.

I rested my free hand on Frankie’s cheek. I think I’d initially wanted to push her back—but in that instant, I just couldn’t. I wouldn’t. The feeling of I want more don’t stop was coursing through my veins like the blood that spilled out from my injury.

“F-Frankie, what are you… C-cut it out..” I whimpered, despite my hand clearly pulling her face in closer. Frankie’s eyes closed as she focused wholly on sucking the red from my finger. Her tongue was surprisingly warm for a half-undead girl, and her mouth coated my finger in a thin layer of saliva. Honestly that probably did more harm than good, but I had neither the will, nor the drive to make her stop.

The tip of Frankie’s tongue moved attentively across the cut on my finger—not too hard, but assertive enough to emphasise her concern.

My breath hitched, and I could feel my heart pumping faster as I tried to calm down. I bit my lip; simultaneously praying that Frankie would both continue and stop—I didn’t know how much more I could take.

The bleeding slows.

My brain, however, does not.

Every coherent thought evaporates all at once, replaced by something hot and buzzing and deeply inconvenient. my breath catches, sharp and quiet, and I have to grip the edge of the counter to steady myself.

Frankie, oblivious, releases my finger after a moment. 

“It should stop now,” she says, sounding satisfied. “Did it help?”

“Yes,” I respond far too quickly. “Yes. Thank you. That—um—that helped a lot.”

Frankie nods, already moving on, already done with the moment.

I, however, am not.

I excused myself to the bedroom under the pretense of being tired, heart pounding like I’ve just done something wrong without knowing what rule I broke. I change, crawl into bed, turn off the lights—

And then lie there.

Wide awake.

My mind replays the moment on an endless loop: Frankie’s hands. Frankie’s mouth. Frankie’s tongue..

The way it felt entirely practical to Frankie and entirely not to me. The way that line between care and something else suddenly feels…thinner.

I stare at the ceiling, pulse still too fast.

*She doesn’t know*, I think.

*She wouldn’t know*.

Frankie was made. Taught. Emotions learned one by one like vocabulary words. Desire isn’t something anyone ever sat her down and explained. Lust isn’t a button you press—it’s a storm you stumble into.

And I don’t know if it’s fair to want Frankie to feel something she might not even understand.

Eventually, exhaustion wins and I halfheartedly decide to retire for the night.

“Tomorrow is a new day..”

I fall asleep with thoughts still tangled, my hand curled against chest, and my head and heart as heavy as lead.

There’s a knot forming..but it’s okay—

Tomorrow is a new day..

Morning comes gently. Sunlight filters through the curtains, pale and forgiving.

I wake up slowly.

Not all at once—more like I drift upward, consciousness settling back into me piece by piece. There’s light first. Pale and soft, slipping through the curtains in thin lines. Then warmth. Then the very specific awareness that I’m not alone.

Frankie is beside me.

She’s facing me, close but not touching—like she’s learned the exact distance that won’t wake me up too suddenly. Her eyes are open. They usually are when I wake. Sometimes I wonder if she ever really sleeps, or if she just waits.

For a moment, I don’t move. I just look at her.

Morning makes everything feel gentler. The seams along her neck are less stark in the soft light. Her hair is messy, falling into her face in uneven strands she hasn’t bothered to fix yet. There’s something unbearably tender about the way she watches me—curious, present, like she’s checking that I still exist.

“Good morning,” she says quietly.

Her voice is steady. The same as always.

“Morning,” I reply, my voice still rough with sleep.

I smile at her, instinctive and automatic, but something in my chest tightens anyway. I remember last night, not vividly—not in detail—but in feeling. The strange, electric awareness that still hasn’t completely faded.

I feel the knot forming again—or, at the very least, a tug from both sides of the rope.

Frankie’s eyes flick to my hand.

A scab has formed where I’d stupidly cut my finger, proof of something that shouldn’t matter as much as it does.

“It didn’t bleed again,” she says.

“No,” I answer. “You took care of it. Thank you baby.”

She smiles brightly and nods, satisfied, like the problem has been solved and neatly filed away. Then she shifts closer, settling into the space beside me like it’s hers by default. Like she belongs there.

And she does. That’s the problem.

I lie there, staring at the ceiling again, my thoughts already starting to tangle. I want things; that much is clear now. Not suddenly, not dramatically—but undeniably. Wanting has crept in quietly, disguised as affection, as comfort, as normalcy.

But wanting implies expectation.

And I don’t know if it’s fair to expect anything from someone who had to be taught how to feel in the first place.

Frankie doesn’t know why last night mattered to me. She doesn’t know it crossed a line I’ve been pretending isn’t there. To her, it was care: practical, effective, finished.

To me, it was something else entirely.

I turn toward her again, brushing a loose strand of hair out of her face without thinking. She stills at the touch, watching me closely, like she’s waiting for instructions she hasn’t been given yet.

“Did you sleep okay?” I ask.

“Yes,” she says. “Frankie stayed here.”

My chest aches at that, for reasons I don’t have the language for yet.

“Good,” I murmur.

The day starts the way it always does after that. We get up. We move through the familiar motions. Coffee, breakfast, small talk, routine. From the outside, nothing has changed.

But inside me, something has shifted.

And as I grab my bag for uni and head for the door, Frankie waving from the window like she always does, I can’t shake the feeling that I’ve stepped closer to a question I’m not ready to ask yet.

Some mornings do that.

I’ve been lurking for a while and finally decided to stop being mysterious and actually say hello.

I’m Lumi. I make nightcore and club music — the kind that makes you want to drive at night with the windows down or dance a little harder than you planned.

But outside of that?  
I’m just a girl who romanticizes mornings, drinks coffee that’s way too sweet, and accidentally holds eye contact a second too long.

I love high energy beats, soft emotions, neon lights, and quiet tension in conversations.  
I think you can be sweet and still a little dangerous.

I’m not here to spam links or scream “stream my track!!!” every 5 minutes — I promise. I’d rather actually talk to people and share vibes than be annoying.

If you’re into nightcore, club energy, or just slightly chaotic soft girls… we’ll probably get along. 🌸

He and his partner have done a great job around my house.

I called him back a few weeks later to clear a drain outside my house (not related to anything he had done previously) and he charged a relatively small amount for it (£30). It was a 10 minute job but I would say it was probably the best £30 I’ve spent even thing I haven’t paid him yet.He said he would send his bank details over but I still haven’t received it. I messaged him two weeks ago and he read the message but haven’t had a response. Should I message again or leave it because I know it’s not a lot of money but it’s just principle of it. I don’t want to assume it’s a goodwill gesture because he has said I’ve made his jobs easier for him when he came round by choosing the right sizes of materials, quantities, being accommodating, etc. He tried to give me a discount at the end of the second job he done for me and I said nah it’s fine because it’s the price you quoted and I was fine with it to begin with.

My girlfriend is a zombie… 

Crap—sorry, can I restart? That was a weird way to start this huh? 

I guess I just didn’t really know how, or where, to begin. That feels important to say first, I think. Because this isn’t exactly the kind of thing you casually ease into, like *Hi, nice to meet you, my girlfriend is undead and stitched together from multiple people.* There’s no smooth transition for that.

Maybe…let’s start with me? Yeah. Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Start simple.

My name’s Opal. Opal Braeburn.

And—uh—this is the part where I’m supposed to say something interesting about myself, right? I always freeze here. I’m not really an interesting girl in the traditional sense, so I never know what to lead with.

I listen to music. A lot. I study way too much at university. I draw when my hands won’t stop shaking. I play the harp—badly, but with enthusiasm. Oh! And I can make a *killer* apple pie. Like, genuinely. People ask for it specifically. That feels worth mentioning.

…Okay, wow. Sorry.

I guess I can’t just derail into a full autobiography after *that* opening.

Right. Back on track. Focus, Opal.

So. My girlfriend is a zombie.

And I don’t mean that metaphorically, or rhetorically, or poetically, or theoretically, or in any other fancy way people like to hide behind when reality gets uncomfortable. My girlfriend is a zombie—straight up. Slow walking, group-stalking, flesh-eating, undying, never-crying, centre of my world zombie. That centre of my world zombie is Frankie.

Frankie and I live together in a small apartment that probably wasn’t zoned for undead occupancy, but hey, no one’s complained yet. It smells like disinfectant, old books, and whatever candle scent she thought sounded nice but forgot she already lit three hours ago. The walls are thin, the radiator knocks like it’s trying to communicate in morse code, and the bathroom light flickers if you look at it wrong. It’s not much. But it’s mine I guess. Mine? Ours? I don’t exactly know how to label it yet.. 

She doesn’t sleep like I do, so sometimes I wake up and she’s already sitting on the couch, staring at the wall like it owes her money. Well—that’s the best case scenario. 

Before I go any further, I should probably clear something up—because when most people hear zombie, they immediately picture something out of a low-budget horror flick. You know the type. Brain-hungry, groaning, arms-out, legally dead in both body and personality.

Frankie isn’t that.

Frankie is a Frankenstein zombie, Frankenstein No.13. Which I know doesn’t sound better on paper, but it is I swear! The story wouldn't be called *My Girlfriend Is A Zombie* if she tried mauling me to death after all. She’s not infected. She didn’t crawl out of a grave because someone forgot to lock the cemetery. She was made. Carefully. Deliberately.

She’s stitched together from a lot of different people, yes—but she isn’t a collective. She’s not a swarm wearing a body. She’s Frankie. One person. One mind. One very specific way of tilting her head when she’s confused and one very specific laugh that sounds like she’s surprised it came out at all.

She eats normal food. She gets distracted mid-sentence. She forgets where she puts things and then gets genuinely offended when the thing turns out to be in her hand. She is undead, technically, but she’s also the most alive person I know. And she’s the person who makes me feel most alive.

Anyway.

I promise that explanation will matter later.

For now—

Let me tell you how this really starts.

I wake up because I can’t breathe properly.

Not in a panic way. More in a *there is a very real weight on my chest.*

My eyes crack open, unfocused, and the first thing I see is Frankie’s blood-red hair, draped like curtains.

Frankie is laying on top of me.

Not aggressively or heavily. Just..there. Her arms are braced on either side of my shoulders, careful not to put too much weight on me like she’s memorised exactly how much pressure is acceptable. Her face is a few inches away from mine, close enough that I can see the fine stitches along her jaw and the way one of her eyes lags a fraction of a second behind the other when she blinks. 

She’s staring at me.

Silently.

Intently.

If I hadn’t just woken up, I’m sure both my ears and cheeks would flush in colours of red and purple.

“…Frankie,” I mumble, voice thick with sleep. “Why are you looming?”

“Frankie woke up,” she says.

“That explains you,” I reply. “Not why you’re hovering like a sleep paralysis demon.”

She tilts her head, considering this.

“Frankie wanted to see if you were still you,” she says after a moment.

I sigh, lifting one hand to rest against her waist. Her hips press into mine, and I realise that Frankie has zero idea as to how well her body fits into my hand. “I’m still me.”

Her shoulders relax immediately, like she’s been holding that tension all night. She leans a little closer—not touching, not yet—just enough that our foreheads almost meet.

“Good,” she says. “Frankie likes this version.”

And just like that, with the morning light creeping through the curtains and my undead girlfriend balanced carefully on top of me, I remember something important.

This isn’t a horror story. It’s a love story. It just happens to involve a zombie.

Frankie eventually slides off me like gravity remembered it had a job to do.

She settles beside me instead, close enough that our shoulders touch, her fingers loosely hooked into the sleeve of my shirt like she’s anchoring herself. I stare at the ceiling for a moment, letting my brain catch up with my body, letting the day announce itself slowly instead of all at once.

Mornings are usually like this. Not dramatic or cinematic. Guess that perfectly describes me and my life.

Most days, I wake up first. I shower, get dressed, check my phone, panic briefly about deadlines, stress out about rent, and then remember that none of those things are currently happening this second, which helps. You know, all the typical stuff you’d expect from a 22 year old girl. Frankie usually wakes up somewhere in the middle of that routine, drifting in and out like she’s still deciding whether consciousness is worth the commitment. Wish I could do that honestly. God, her ability to do that is impressive. Imagine being able to just… Focus Opal, it’s a thought for another time!

Anyways, after that we make breakfast.

Well..*I* make breakfast. Frankie supervises.

She sits at the counter with her chin in her hands, watching me like I’m performing a magic trick instead of scrambling eggs. Sometimes she asks questions.

“Why do you add salt before tasting?”

“Why does toast smell different when it’s burnt?”

“Why do people drink coffee if it tastes like mud-water”

I answer all of them. Even the ones I don’t have good answers for, which is most.

After breakfast, I pack my bag for university. Books, laptop, charger, notebook with doodles in the margins because my hands don’t know how to be still. Frankie walks me to the door every time, even though she doesn’t have to. She likes the ritual. She likes waving from the window until I turn the corner.

I think she likes knowing I’ll come back.

And I always do.

That’s the easy part of my life. The routine. The normalcy. The fact that loving a zombie still somehow includes overdue assignments, grocery lists, and arguing about whether the apartment is too cold.

The harder part is everything I don’t say.

There are moments—quiet ones usually—where I want more. Not in a reckless, dramatic way. Just…more closeness. More reassurance that the feelings I have are allowed to exist without being selfish.

Sometimes it’s when Frankie laughs, really laughs, like something surprised her into joy. Sometimes it’s when she leans into me without thinking, resting her head on my shoulder like it’s the most natural place in the world. Sometimes it’s at night, when we’re lying side by side and I’m very aware of the space between us because I’m the one maintaining it.

I don’t know where the line is, nor how far over it I should go.

Frankie was made, not born. She had to learn emotions the way I learned algebra—slowly, painfully, with a lot of trial and error. Happiness. Sadness. Fear. Attachment. Those came first. Those were easy to recognise, easy to label.

But things like desire? Wanting someone in a way that goes beyond comfort or safety?

I don’t know if she understands that.

And worse—I don’t know if she should.

What if wanting more from her is unfair? What if I’m projecting something human and messy onto someone who never asked to be built this way? What if I cross a line she doesn’t even know exists yet?

So I stay where it’s safe.

I hold her hand. I kiss her forehead. I tell her I love her in ways that don’t ask her to give anything back she hasn’t already chosen to give.

And some days, that feels like enough.

Other days…it feels like standing in front of a door I’m too afraid to open, even though I’m already reaching for the knob. But I stop myself. My hand retreats, even if I yearn to brush my fingers against the seams of where one person's skin meets another on her stitched face. 

There’s this one day, nothing special on paper, where all of this hits me at once.

It’s late afternoon, sun retreating into the soft horizon, and darkness begins to cascade across the sky; running like watercolours. I’m sitting on the couch, sketchbook in my lap, pencil hovering uselessly above the page. Frankie is across from me, carefully untangling a necklace she broke earlier and insisting she can fix it, even though I’ve already offered to help.

“You’re frowning,” she says.

“I’m thinking,” I reply.

“About?”

I hesitate. Just for a second too long.

“Nothing important,” I lie.

She studies me. Frankie does that sometimes—looks at me like she’s piecing something together without being sure what the final picture is supposed to look like.

After a moment, she scoots closer. Not touching, just near. I feel the shift in weight on the couch. Her soft, plump thighs creep closer to mine, and I silently pray in the back of my mind that we touch.

“Frankie likes when you’re here,” she says. “With Frankie .”

My chest tightens, and I feel my ears twitch.

“I like being here too,” I say.

And I mean it. I really do.

It's gonna be quite long but I hope it helps.

**When to study?**
+ Study right after Fajr prayer. Few ppl might feel sleepy but trust me when I say this studying after fajr is the golden time. If u feel sleepy during that time, then have a mug of coffee at the end of Suhoor. 

**8hrs of study?**
+ If u start studying right after Fajr,u will eventually study 6hrs with 4 breaks (15 min each) in between. I would highly suggest u to choose subject u find difficult right after Fajr...and change the subject in decreasing order of difficulty. Don't skip breaks...or else u will feel tired by Zuhr.Then after Zuhr,come back home and take rest for a while... And by Asr u can eventually do more 2hrs even if u sleep for 2hrs. By now,u will be done with 8hrs of study already. 

**Follow these without fail**
+ Remember to not use ur other devices while ur studying...coz once u do,u will keep procrastinating it. The flow of the energy gets disturbed.And if ur cramming formulas or anything that requires more energy,do them first and eventually shift to other topics. 

+ After asr,DONT try to study anything...just spend time with ur family,help them out and prepare for iftar. Meanwhile u can read Qur'an or at the least u can read Tasbeeh.And make lots of Dua(must)... Coz u didn't just do ibadath but also u have fulfilled the responsibility- the responsibility as a student. Be proud of that. 

Now after Maghrib till Isha- do wtever u want to(ofc nthng sorta haram) I would suggest u to not study again as it may lead to burnout. 

After coming from Isha and Taraveeh,either u sit to revise wtever u learnt or else just go to sleep. I'm a night owl,so I don't get sleep soon...so i study for more 1-2hrs until I get tired and then doze off. 

Ofc within every 2-3 days,10hrs of study might fall to 7-8 hrs but it's fine...don't be harsh on urself. Wt matters is how effectively ur focusing. 

Allah sees ur efforts and knows everything ur dealing with. He has never barred u from fulfilling ur responsibilities..Dua right before iftar is the key here,so don't miss that. Do not miss out prayers and fasts unless doc has advised u to. Keep doing good deeds as the reward for it gets multiplied by 70 times it's original value. And try to avoid sinning as much as possible. 

**Suhoor tips**
+ Eat foods which have more protein content. Eating a banana during suhoor helps few ppl..(they say they don't feel hungry easily) So u could try that as well.
Additionally,u can add chia seeds to water and drink it during suhoor. 

This month is filled with blessings and barakah.. so don't miss it out. May Allah bless us with health and barakah! Aameen!

This is just my suggestion..u can make changes to it as per ur conditions.

(If ur a non-muslim,do consider upvoting it as its gonna help many other muslim students,thanks in advance!)

I woke up a bit before 3AM to take a leak. I instantly smelled foul diesel exhaust fumes. The smell was coming from the ventilation which is just connected to outside air without any sort of activated charcoal filters. 

I closed the vents and opened the window just to get slammed in the face with more fumes. I poked my head out and tried to get a look at the loud rumbling source. Couldn't see any running vehicles. Probably around the corner.

So I just mumbled ""Idiots..."" under my breath and somehow managed to get back to sleep in my now industrial apartment. 



I woke up at 5:30AM. The smell was mostly gone but I still heard the rumble. Opened up the window and yes - the diesel was still running after two and a half hours later. 

It smelled awful. I'm a car guy so I knew from the sound and odor that this must have been an old straight four diesel with large displacement. Long before the times any exhaust management systems were in mass production. Old rattling smelling diesel. Like a diesel tractor or something. A mix of unburnt fuel, warm diesel and oil.   

Made coffee, still mumbling to myself. Looked for any authorities to call but being an introvert and since it was still early I procrastinated for an hour or so. 



Then the sound stopped and the fumes were gone. I finally dressed and went outside to look around. A diesel idling for over 3 hours must have left an impression in the snow. It wasn't that cold. Made a full circle around the apartment building and failed to find any indication of a warm vehicle. It had snowed that night so there must have been some tire prints... nothing. 

I was absolutely confused. Looked under parked cars. Checked to see if anyone had moved and covered the spot. 

Made a stroll around the entire neighborhood, still nothing. It was an early Sunday morning so extremely quiet and all cars were parked under a light snow blanket. 



I have no explanation. The sound of the engine wasn't coming from far. I live in a decent neighborhood where absolutely no one owns such an ancient diesel. And if a stranger did sleep in a parked vehicle - how on earth did it leave no impression or tracks? 

  
I asked around but none of the occupants had their vents open during winter. It seems I'm the only one who likes cold fresh air. I'm a freak it would appear. 

So much for a fresh night's sleep. 



Mind boggling.

Frankie usually wakes up somewhere in the middle of that routine, drifting in and out like she’s still deciding whether consciousness is worth the commitment. Wish I could do that honestly. God, her ability to do that is impressive. Imagine being able to just… Focus Opal, it’s a thought for another time!

Anyways, after that we make breakfast.

Well..*I* make breakfast. Frankie supervises.

She sits at the counter with her chin in her hands, watching me like I’m performing a magic trick instead of scrambling eggs. Sometimes she asks questions.

“Why do you add salt before tasting?”

“Why does toast smell different when it’s burnt?”

“Why do people drink coffee if it tastes like mud-water”

I answer all of them. Even the ones I don’t have good answers for, which is most.

After breakfast, I pack my bag for university. Books, laptop, charger, notebook with doodles in the margins because my hands don’t know how to be still. Frankie walks me to the door every time, even though she doesn’t have to. She likes the ritual. She likes waving from the window until I turn the corner.

I think she likes knowing I’ll come back.

And I always do.

That’s the easy part of my life. The routine. The normalcy. The fact that loving a zombie still somehow includes overdue assignments, grocery lists, and arguing about whether the apartment is too cold.

The harder part is everything I don’t say.

There are moments—quiet ones usually—where I want more. Not in a reckless, dramatic way. Just…more closeness. More reassurance that the feelings I have are allowed to exist without being selfish.

Sometimes it’s when Frankie laughs, really laughs, like something surprised her into joy. Sometimes it’s when she leans into me without thinking, resting her head on my shoulder like it’s the most natural place in the world. Sometimes it’s at night, when we’re lying side by side and I’m very aware of the space between us because I’m the one maintaining it.

I don’t know where the line is, nor how far over it I should go.

Frankie was made, not born. She had to learn emotions the way I learned algebra—slowly, painfully, with a lot of trial and error. Happiness. Sadness. Fear. Attachment. Those came first. Those were easy to recognise, easy to label.

But things like desire? Wanting someone in a way that goes beyond comfort or safety?

I don’t know if she understands that.

And worse—I don’t know if she should.

What if wanting more from her is unfair? What if I’m projecting something human and messy onto someone who never asked to be built this way? What if I cross a line she doesn’t even know exists yet?

So I stay where it’s safe.

I hold her hand. I kiss her forehead. I tell her I love her in ways that don’t ask her to give anything back she hasn’t already chosen to give.

And some days, that feels like enough.

Other days…it feels like standing in front of a door I’m too afraid to open, even though I’m already reaching for the knob. But I stop myself. My hand retreats, even if I yearn to brush my fingers against the seams of where one person's skin meets another on her stitched face. 

There’s this one day, nothing special on paper, where all of this hits me at once.

It’s late afternoon, sun retreating into the soft horizon, and darkness begins to cascade across the sky; running like watercolours. I’m sitting on the couch, sketchbook in my lap, pencil hovering uselessly above the page. Frankie is across from me, carefully untangling a necklace she broke earlier and insisting she can fix it, even though I’ve already offered to help.

“You’re frowning,” she says.

“I’m thinking,” I reply.

“About?”

I hesitate. Just for a second too long.

“Nothing important,” I lie.

She studies me. Frankie does that sometimes—looks at me like she’s piecing something together without being sure what the final picture is supposed to look like.

After a moment, she scoots closer. Not touching, just near. I feel the shift in weight on the couch. Her soft, plump thighs creep closer to mine, and I silently pray in the back of my mind that we touch.

“Frankie likes when you’re here,” she says. “With Frankie .”

My chest tightens, and I feel my ears twitch.

“I like being here too,” I say.

And I mean it. I really do.

I’m not gonna lie, I do like gacha games and anime for more than my friends do - they mainly like kpop and recently ice skating for the winter olympics - which does make me a major outcast from the group. Though i do find it quite ironic since I initially made friends with C due to our shared interest in anime- but I digress. They’re far more extroverted than I am, C isnt a major extrovert she’s introverted like myself but does have the capacity to     be more outgoing than I am.  “I”already has many pre-established relationships so you can infer  she is far more mature and socially she is.  Me on the other hand is as quiet as they come, I don’t speak much even around them, I dare not speak around strangers unless we share a common interest and I’m far more careless in social situations than my peers. All in all, I am socially challenged.

With this in mind, however, they still care for me and I can sense that they see me a friend rather than a walking fiend. But at times this feeling has greatly betrayed me, recently we were working together for a competition with three other older guys, beginning with them hounding me to get coffee five minutes before the beginning seminar began making me almost 25 minutes late because I had no idea of-the area (they know the area), later on they just kept on berating me for how im doing nothing for the team (i dont work well in teams and they have me nothing to do) and also hammering how I probably don’t wash myself (i dont have relatively good hygiene). Overall being somewhat cruel towards me, worsened by the fact that they only talked amongst themselves- cant blame them for this because i dont speak much even with them. The only thing I really did was research for the project, nothing much else. But for most part the part that really triggered my plea here was them silently leaving me alone with one of guys while they went to go get a drink, I didnt think much of this because this was a an occurrence that happened somewhat frequently (they did this throughout high school),  but when my mother asked about if I was ok when i told her this I began to question the legitimacy of our relationship.

You can ask questions if you like but my main question is whether or not I should distance myself from these individuals,  i havent yet made a huge rebuttal to their ‘bantering’ yet- only a few minor callouts. In the end though, I cant blame them - I am a loser, they’re my only real friends and we share practically nothing in common.

The free version gives you the basic tinted overlay with adjustable size, shape, and intensity. 

Today I'm releasing the **Full** version, which has everything in free, additional customisation, and also adds caret tracking. This allows the keyhole to automatically follow where you're typing and works across apps like Chrome, Safari, Obsidian, Notes, VS Code, etc.

People have many variables to change, grind size, input dose, flow rate, shot time and dialing a shot to 1:2 may be slightly different to a 1:2.5 or 1:3   
In fact, 1:2 is much harder to dial, as you are limiting the amount of coffee extracted coffee you are getting, making it much easier to underextract your shot.   
I read some people say shorter ratios work better with dark roasts, and 1:1 is good option for them too, but is that truly the case? Or is it people being afraid of bitter notes?   
Bitter notes are natural in coffee, to varying degrees between beans and higher in dark roasts, and it doesn't mean over extraction  
The bigger problem is the coffee wasted going with shorter ratios, and by extracting a bit longer you get more coffee flavor, which is more noticeable in milk based drinks   
I feel like we are setting up people for failure by telling them to optimize for 1:2 ratios as they are trickier to optimize

&#x200B;

Java Burn is not just another weight loss supplement; it's a transformational elixir that has left me astounded. As someone who has explored various weight management products, Java Burn stands out as a revolutionary solution. This review sheds light on my personal experience with Java Burn, a product that has redefined my approach to weight loss.

&#x200B;

\*\*Effective Weight Management: ★★★★★ (5/5)\*\*

&#x200B;

Java Burn's primary claim is to enhance weight loss, and it delivers on this promise with impressive results. After incorporating it into my daily routine, I experienced a noticeable increase in my metabolism. This translated into more effective fat burning, especially when combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise. The pounds started melting away, and I felt more energetic throughout the day.

&#x200B;

\*\*Sustained Energy: ★★★★★ (5/5)\*\*

&#x200B;

One of the most remarkable aspects of Java Burn is its ability to provide sustained energy without the typical jitters associated with some weight loss supplements. Instead of experiencing crashes, I felt a steady and consistent stream of energy, which was instrumental in maintaining an active lifestyle. It helped me power through workouts and stay alert throughout my day, making it easier to make healthier choices.

&#x200B;

\*\*Enhanced Mental Clarity: ★★★★★ (5/5)\*\*

&#x200B;

Java Burn doesn't just target physical weight loss; it also supports mental clarity and focus. The blend of natural ingredients, including nootropics, contributed to improved cognitive function. This mental boost helped me stay on track with my weight loss goals by reducing cravings and emotional eating.

&#x200B;

\*\*Natural Ingredients: ★★★★★ (5/5)\*\*

&#x200B;

Java Burn's use of natural ingredients is commendable. It contains a blend of powerful compounds like green tea extract, green coffee bean extract, and more, which are backed by scientific research for their weight management benefits. Knowing that I was consuming a product with safe and natural ingredients gave me confidence in its effectiveness and safety.

&#x200B;

\*\*Conclusion:\*\*

&#x200B;

Java Burn is a game-changer in the world of weight management supplements. It doesn't promise overnight miracles but offers a holistic approach to sustainable weight loss. I've experienced firsthand how it can boost metabolism, provide lasting energy, enhance mental clarity, and support a healthier lifestyle. If you're on a weight loss journey and want a reliable partner, Java Burn is worth a try.

She’s married and has a son. We were genuinely good friends — talking daily, hanging out at work, going to cafés together. I saw her like a sister.

Everything was fine until another coworker (40M), who is also married with kids, started spending a lot of time in her office. My office is next to hers, and since her room has the hot water and coffee supplies, I’d often hang out there too.

At first, their conversations were normal — religion, daily life, random topics. But over time, they became very close. They started going on smoke breaks together, texting after work, and he’d bring her snacks. When we’d go out for coffee, he’d join, and she clearly enjoyed his company.

After about 5–6 months, it felt obvious that they had developed a special closeness. I tried to tell myself they were just friends.

We were both invited to his birthday party. That night, I was sitting between them on a couch. He put his arm along the back of the couch, and I suddenly felt uncomfortable, so I got up and walked away. They stayed sitting together alone for about 40 minutes.

Later, about a month after that, she asked me to go on an overnight trip — just the three of us. No spouses, no kids. I initially agreed, but my boyfriend thought it was strange and asked why their families weren’t included. I also wasn’t sure if she had even told her husband it would only be the three of us.

The more I thought about it, the more uncomfortable I felt, so I backed out.

She got very upset with me. She said I ditched her and even said negative things about my boyfriend for influencing my decision.

That same weekend the trip was supposed to happen, I saw her bike and his scooter parked outside a restaurant together. This was after I had said I wasn’t going. It really shocked me.

At work, she never mentioned that they had gone out. When I told her I saw their bikes, she responded by saying she doesn’t have to tell me everything. After that, she became distant, and we barely talk now.

Recently, another colleague told me there are rumors they’re sleeping together. Apparently, he even told someone they had sex the night of his birthday. I don’t know if that’s true.

We used to be very close, and when I expressed discomfort, she became defensive and pulled away and started hanging out with him most of the times

We talked to each other, more and more each day and on the final day she confessed to me and I told her I like her back, but that I dont want to rush things as I have never been in a relationship, and she agreed with me. However for the past 2 days we talked so much that it almost feels like we are in a relationship already. What would be the next step?

Tomorrow we are gonna see each other at school and it’s probably going to be very awkard. Im and introvert and the thought of buying her flowers, taking her to a coffee, holding her hand while walking, hugging in public and spending time together freaks me out, not because I dont like her, I really really like her, but I am scared of anything new. 

1 week ago I was just thinking about visiting places on the school trip and now I’m talking to a beautiful and smart girl that likes me. 

I am a very big overthinker and I have so many thoughts in my head. I come from a middle class family , I live in a 2 bedroom apartment and share my room and bed with my lil brother, so calling her to my place to chill and talk won’t happen a lot since I am very insecure about this. I can probably afford to buy her flowers and take her out to a coffee once a week and maybe to a restaurant once a month. She doesn’t seem the type to care about my financial status as her family is richer than mine and I overhead her during the trip tell another guy that was asking her about relationship advice say something like “getting a pretzel together  is enough” . 

Im also scared of telling my parents although it probably won’t be a problem because they’ve been asking me every now and then when will I go out with a girl. 

I’m still wondering what she likes about me, so far she told me that I act mature and that I am kind, but other than that I consider myself a 5/10. I’m not athletic although I started going to the gym 2 months ago and I will probably look better by summer, and I don’t consider my face any better as I am getting a jumpscare every time I open my front camera . 

I have a few friends that have relationships and 1 girl has way way more money than my friend and they still have a happy and nice relationship, she pays for the stuff most of the time and he buys her flowers occasionally , he doesn’t do much for her except for being present and it looks like she is happier than ever. 

What should I do? Tomorrow we are going to see each other on the school hallways and I have no idea how to act .",1,1771750427.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

So many illegal shit going on here its insane how they continue to get away with it.","I recently parted with UWM. Thank God. The corruption and crookedness and lies from leaders to naive and gullible college dropouts. Bunch of drug addicted alcoholics 9000 employees, cult followers, whatever you want to refer to them as. 500 AEs, of those 500, 50 are making any decent money. You have people here who sucked the right dick and fingered the right asshole to get a top opportunity and hey, more power to them! Not sure how an AVP can get caught in the bathroom with his dick in another dudes mouth yet still gets worshipped like hes the Almighty, and the other dude was fired lol that is insane. I know a guy who was fired because he wanted to shadow Mat Ishbia. Leader of said fellow was also demoted! i think that is absolutely hilarious and screams how insecure that man is. Fucking walk on at State because his daddy funded millions into the athletics program and played like 4 mins his entire college career like what're we talking about! That's hysterical in and of itself lol. Anyways haha I'm so ashamed at the amount of time and sacrifices i and so many others gave to this company to be slowly weened out because they cannot stand to see someone do their job without kissing ass and still succeed. This place does not like that.

 You've got left over snow in every stall. A VP who goes up in front of thousands every Wednesday looking like he rolled out of bed with a 5th of jack Daniels in his hand i swear you could fit a weeks worth of clothing and supplies in the bags under this mans eyes. You'd have to pay extra to check those bags to because they would definitely not fit in the overhead compartment. Cant go a single meeting without talking about getting a drink at his fav Italian restaurant. 

You have a BRAND AMBASSADOR, SUPPOSED ""FACE OF MOTIVATION AND CULTURE"" ON MOTEL SURVEILLANCE SPRINTING AFTER A FULLY CLOTHED WOMAN IN NOHTING BUT HIS BOXERS AND DRAGGING HER BACK INTO HIS ROOM. LITERAL SEXUAL ASSAULT AND RAPE CASE. But wants to hop on stage and tell ME to get MY mind right?? How about you finally figure out how to tie a fucking tie and put on some fucking dress shoes looking like a fool wearing Jordan's and a fucking suit 2x to big for him. Foh w that. How about ""Get yo mind right! And keep yo hands to your fuckin self!"" Go to Joanns and get some new mf material shit is so lame.  Couldnt keep him much longer with that rep and people starting to finally find out. Lets send him to Phoenix and put him on the Suns payroll they dont know anything about that incident. Shall i continue? After parties oh those were fun, VPs sniffing the sniff out of escorts asscracks. The amount of infidelity and sexual activites that take place here is disgusting. I remember my first day in trainings at the sports comp. Who's that lady that ran those trainings that always looked so miserable and never had any enthusiasm whatsoever, Rachel? I remember someone asking ""why is the holiday party team members only?"" and her immediate response is ""i mean cmonnn, do you really want your home wife meeting your work wife? Across 7 thousand people? Things may get a little sticky so we keep it to TM only."" Not even a mention of the assumed TRIPLING IN COST MAYBE? People of higher positions will intentionally and selectively choose attractive women with not even half a brain in their noggin to be their assistant and stroke their ego all day. Im talking some of the most absurd outfits to be strutting around a corporate building. Its insane the entitlement and lack of sense these people have. The amount of nepotism, from the Tr---s, to the P---lls, to the specific AEs whos 98 brothers sisters and cousins originate from the same broker shop and get special pricing in return for business. This is illegal in so many ways and is not even bothered to be investigated. This place preaches ethics and moral meanwhile they're strategically picking and choosing who gets what. The amount of title and position changes is strictly to save face and essentially abandon the position they were guilty of committing fraud or other illegal activity under. Got some CE whatever CF CO idek anymore its changed so often. Fuckin VP of a billion dollar company and shows up twice a month to bitch and moan and give some BS sob story about his son like anybody gives AF. The secondhand embarassment i had watching him try so hard to be a hard ass and act like we remember who even is like...youre still here? Bro you come to the office once a month in your jeans and hoodie but want to humiliate top AEs on a group email because one didnt have a tie on in a picture with him and HIS clients. Fuccckkk that I eat pieces of shit like these cucks for breakfast lunch and dinner. I would have walked into his office, wiped my dirty ass with my tie, and dropped it on that dick heads desk. That man is such a fake ass human being.  I dont think these VPs are good for anything other than taking the fall for a crooked billionaire and pretending and trying so hard to be a significant figure in any way. You tell them to stick theirs hands in a bucket of shit and clap, they'll ask ""yes my lord! how deep my lord?"" Got former day 1s, the main 12 as they it idfk. Threatening to commit heinous violence across multiple people of authority and jumping state. Dudes name dropping people that we stroke so hard accusing them of putting hits on his head, taking out life insurance policies. One of the CEOs best buds and main dude the guy who so called created half of the tech that we cherish so much. You got this guy fearing so hard for his life to where he disappears completely. Abandons a company he apparently helped create and grow to where it is now Were just gonna sit here and act like thats a coincidence? like this guy, sure he was off the boogy sugy HEAVILY but hear me out. Who on earth, would out of the blue, make such specific accusations, against his own people, and just disappear. Nobody's gonna say it....? Are we being serious?  

 People here are so headstrong and money hungry. Got AEs making millions in a year, before they changed the comp structure 3 different times. These same guys show up every so often. Walk around with the new twat who gets paid 80k in a year to get coffee and run errands lmao its a joke. There's a very odd pattern of certain people and well integrated individuals, ironically and coincidentally, that benefit the most of everyone. These same beneficiaries are those who run the highest producing broker shops and, what do you know, their entire 90 person family runs that \*Michigan\* broker shop and hey what do you know their spouse is the county's top real estate agent and is partnered directly with that shop. HALL FINANCIAL RECEIVES SPECIFIC PRICING INCENTIVES THAT NO OTHER BROKER SHOPS RECEIVE. These same AEs could not run a training to save their fucking life and i cant tell you how many clients I've spoken to, had to accompany at mix and mingles because they dont know who the fuck theyre AE is nor have they ever met him. Come to find these are the same AEs who we all know and praise and respect so much, its insulting and fucking embarrassing.  And we are lied to and made to believe this is a even playing field. Gosh i cant even explain the amount of visible paranoia and concern that permanently stained the faces of such AEs that have to manage these accounts. People out here missing family dinners getting home late so we can ""treat"" More like bribe. The word is bribe. These brokers with free food and drinks and a free hotel stay. Lord help me. But hey, takes what it takes! 

Oh that reminds me. Whats her name. Shes an AE. So weird how her family owns 423 main, isnt it? One of the main restaurants that UWM uses for such dinners and bribery. An active employee, AE, whos family is RECEIVING AND EXTREME INFLUX OF BUSINESS 3 NIGHTS OUT OF THE WEEK. THAT UWM BLATENTLY FUNNELS THEIR WAY and the amount of times they swipe Mats black card. So, Mat gets a good deal, funnels business their way, AE in return is a fall person for the shady accounts and illegal activites these mortgage professionals that she knowingly assists in committing every day. This entire company is corrupt and i cannot for the life of me figure out HOW they continue to get away with it lol im deceased right now at the amount of peddling and corruption and scandals that take place here . We have people funneling MILLIONS of dollars to and from and within their family related broker shop and family related realtor shop. Meanwhile you've got people coming in running laps around the building being promised bullshit lies only see $600 a week for the first 2 years minimum. Its a joke. This place will fall and people will be exposed, not sure when but i cannot wait for the day. I got a whole gang of this shit. This company and the dream they fabricate and tease you with, its all a facade and smoke and mirrors. Not sure for other departments but from what i see, looks like its pretty consistent across the other 9000 sheep that show up and do what theyre told. ",2,1771750372.0,pillar7,0,0.75,False

I got into a rhythm of heavy cream for a while and macadamia nuts, lots of butter and lost 15 lbs. This  time round I tried cutting out the heavy cream and macadamia nuts thinking I would loose more weight. But I haven’t lost any, and got so hungry I broke the diet.

But I don’t know, it’s not flowing like before. Thinking of just going back to heavy cream in coffee and afternoon snacks, focus on butter and eating macadamia  nuts agains. I know it’s counterintuitive for weight loss, but last time that’s what I did and I lost weight. Also it was so much easier to adhere to, never felt tempted to cheat, probably bc was so high fat. Anyone actually loose weight being liberal with heavy cream and macadamia nuts?

1rbgui9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1rbgui9/guarded_interested_or_just_polite/,Guarded interested or just polite?,"I’m a 31M and she’s 35F. We knew of each other from seeing each other around, but we were basically strangers until recently. We first properly started talking when she reached out to me for help with something stressful in her life. I helped, we exchanged numbers, and started texting.

She has some unresolved stuff from a past relationship, and it seems like there are still things in her day-to-day life that keep that stress present for her. I don’t want to get into details, but my impression is that she’s still carrying a lot emotionally.

At first, she was friendly but a bit noncommittal. I suggested meeting once and she basically said something like “maybe, if I’m free I’ll let you know,” and that she doesn’t like promising things if she’s not sure. She was nice about it, but she didn’t follow up that time.

But we kept texting, and over time she got more engaged. She was warm, playful, reacted to my messages, asked me questions, and shared personal stuff too. Eventually I asked her for coffee, and she said yes (a little tentative at first, but she helped coordinate it).

We ended up spending around 90 minutes together (coffee and walk). We were both a little nervous at first, but she helped the conversation flow. It got deep pretty fast and she opened up about some hard things. At one point she joked that we should keep it lighter, but we drifted back into heavier topics before eventually getting into more normal/lighter stuff. She stayed engaged the whole time, and when I suggested continuing with a walk, she agreed (and said she was about to suggest that too). We ended warmly and said we’d be in touch.

Afterward, I texted that I had a nice time and joked that next time we should stick to lighter topics. She responded warmly and agreed.

Since then, we’ve kept texting and had some longer conversations. The vibe is good overall, joking around, sharing music tastes and random preferences, her asking me questions, her complimenting things I say sometimes, message reactions, etc. It doesn’t feel cold or one-sided to me.

The issue is meeting up again. I asked about hanging out another time, and she said her days are unpredictable right now because of things going on in her life, and her plans keep changing. I kept it low pressure and said it should feel easy, not like an obligation. She responded well to that. Later she also messaged to say she hadn’t forgotten, but her weekend got busy, and if she found time she’d let me know. I replied in a relaxed way and she ended it warmly.

For context, I’m also going through a difficult period personally and under a lot of stress, but I haven’t really shared much of that with her yet.

So I’m trying to get an outside read. Does this sound more like she’s genuinely interested but overwhelmed/cautious/slow-moving, or more like she’s just a warm person being polite and not actually trying to date?

And what’s the best move from here? Keep it light and occasional, wait for her to initiate, ask one more time in a clear but low-pressure way, or just step back?",1,1771749998.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

He is divorced, he and his ex have 2 children together (I also have 1 from a pervious relationship). 

We have a whole coffee station (I love coffee, I have a container for the beans, grinder, coffee maker, etc) and above it my partner put a picture he had with a Johnny Cash quote on it,  ""this morning, with her, having coffee"". It was unopened when he brought it out initially, and I didn't think anything of it. 

Tonight, I looked at the picture and it was like a lightning bolt- I am not the reason this decoration exists in our kitchen, because he already owned it before we moved in together. So I asked him about it and he confirmed that he had originally ordered it as a decoration for his ex wife. The original was damaged, so they sent a replacement. He fixed the original so that's why this one was still unopened when we moved in together, it's the replacement that they sent, but the original was hung up previously in their house.

He argued that this picture was never hung up in his old house (that his ex lives in) and so it's not the same. But to me it feels like he's recycled this thing to apply to me instead of who it was intended for. I don't feel good about being a ""replacement"" and he knows that. I started crying over it because we've been together over 2 years and sometimes I still struggle with the replacement feelings. He said he would take it down tomorrow because he doesn't want this to be a big deal.

1rbgrj8,https://i.redd.it/rzhkxf4id0lg1.jpeg,I'm a coffee beginner. Thinking of getting De'Longhi La Specialista. Suggestion or advice welcomed?,"I want to dive into the coffee world.

I don't want to get into the filter or press as I am more into milk coffee (hot & cold)

Three reasons why I chose La Specialista is because

1. It has an inbuilt grinder, so I don't need a separate machine or hand grinder.

2. It's compact and affordable for a home.

3. It also has an automatic feature, probably useful for beginners like me. After I get the hang of the science, I can switch to manual.

Looking for reviews or tips from anyone who is already using it.

It also made a very loud sound when running. 

Fellow was able to ship me a new one which I have used since with no problems, but decided this week to take a closer look at my old Aiden and somehow fixed the issue after tinkering with it. 

Fix 1: Coffee Ground stuck in the water tube  
Here is a video where someone identifies and fixes this issue.   
[https://www.tiktok.com/@thecolecoleman/video/7555630308352134413](https://www.tiktok.com/@thecolecoleman/video/7555630308352134413)

When I tried this, I spotted a small coffee ground that had lodged itself in the little water pusher (no clue what it's called)   
After cleaning that and putting it in decalcer mix, just in case the first issue was fixed, and the flush function worked again, although it did say flush failed and also continued to say ""add water"" when I tried to brew

  
Fix 2: Water Pump   
The fix that solved my issue was taking out the Water Pump from the Fellow Aiden, loosening all the screws it had and take it apart, what I found was that somehow coffee water had ended up in the water pump which is of course there shouldn't be.  
I cleaned up the coffee water in the pump, let it dry for a little, reattached all parts and fastened it all as much as possible and boom suddenly my old Aiden works as good as new

This fixed not just the ""add water"" error but also the loud sound that came from my Aiden so if anyone has these issues give it a test and see if it also fixes it for you  ",3,1771749272.0,FellowProducts,0,1.0,False
1rbgmia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menscomeback/comments/1rbgmia/the_psychology_of_building_discipline_the/,# The Psychology of Building Discipline: The Science-Based 2-Minute Trick That Actually Works,"Look, I spent years thinking discipline was something you either had or didn't have. Like some people were just born with this superhuman ability to wake up at 5 AM, hit the gym, and crush their goals while I was still hitting snooze. Turns out, that's complete bullshit. After diving deep into behavioral psychology research, neuroscience books, and podcasts from experts like Andrew Huberman and James Clear, I realized discipline isn't a personality trait. It's a skill. And like any skill, you can build it. The trick? Start so small it feels stupid.

# Why Your Brain Fights Discipline

Here's what most people don't get: Your brain is wired to avoid discomfort. It's not your fault. Evolution designed your brain to conserve energy and seek immediate rewards. That's why scrolling TikTok feels easier than doing the hard work that actually moves your life forward.

When you try to build discipline by going from zero to hero overnight, your brain freaks out. It sees the massive change as a threat and floods you with resistance. That's why New Year's resolutions fail. You're fighting against millions of years of programming.

The solution? You need to hack your brain's resistance system. And that's where the 2-minute rule comes in.

# Step 1: Start With 2 Minutes (Seriously, Just 2 Minutes)

This comes straight from James Clear's [Atomic Habits](https://a.co/d/09JS21fu), one of the most practical books on behavior change I've ever read. Clear breaks down how tiny habits compound over time, and he's got the science to back it up. The book sold over 15 million copies because it actually works.

The rule is simple: When you want to build a new habit, scale it down to something you can do in 2 minutes or less.

Want to start reading? Read one page.  
Want to meditate? Sit for 2 minutes.  
Want to work out? Do 5 pushups.  
Want to write? Write one sentence.

The goal isn't to finish a marathon. The goal is to show up. Your brain can't throw up resistance to something that takes 2 minutes. It's too small to fight.

# Step 2: Make It So Easy You Can't Say No

The magic of the 2-minute trick is that it removes the mental barrier to starting. Most of the time, starting is the hardest part. Once you're moving, momentum takes over.

BJ Fogg's research at Stanford's Behavior Design Lab proves this. In his book *Tiny Habits*, Fogg shows that behavior change happens when you make things ridiculously easy. He calls it ""shrinking the behavior."" The smaller the behavior, the less motivation you need to do it.

I started using this with my morning routine. Instead of trying to meditate for 20 minutes (which I always skipped), I committed to 2 minutes. Just sitting down and breathing. That's it. After a few weeks, 2 minutes turned into 5, then 10. Not because I forced myself, but because starting became automatic.

# Step 3: Stack Your Tiny Habits

Once you've got your 2-minute habit locked in, you can start building on it. This is called habit stacking, another concept from *Atomic Habits*. You attach a new behavior to an existing one.

For example:  
After I pour my coffee, I'll do 2 minutes of stretching.  
After I brush my teeth, I'll read one page.  
After I sit at my desk, I'll write one sentence.

The existing habit becomes the trigger for the new one. Your brain loves routines, so you're basically piggybacking on behaviors that are already automatic.

# Step 4: Track It Like Your Life Depends On It

You need to see your progress. Not in some abstract way, but visually. Get the Finch app or just use a simple calendar. Every day you do your 2-minute habit, mark it off. Don't break the chain.

Jerry Seinfeld used this method to become one of the greatest comedians alive. He put a big X on his calendar every day he wrote jokes. The chain of Xs became so satisfying that he didn't want to break it. That visual feedback tricks your brain into craving consistency.

For those looking for a more structured approach to habit building, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is worth checking out. Built by a team from Columbia University, it's a personalized learning app that pulls from books like *Atomic Habits*, research on behavior change, and expert insights to create custom learning plans around your specific goals, like building discipline as someone who struggles with consistency. You can set a goal like ""become more disciplined with my morning routine"" and it generates an adaptive plan just for you. The app turns these insights into quick audio lessons you can adjust from a 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples, so you can learn during your commute or workout. Plus, you get a virtual coach that helps keep the process structured and way less overwhelming than trying to piece together advice from multiple sources.

This is backed by behavioral psychology research on variable rewards. Seeing that chain grow releases dopamine, the same chemical that makes scrolling Instagram addictive. You're literally rewiring your brain to crave discipline instead of distraction.

# Step 5: Celebrate Small Wins Like a Maniac

Here's something most people skip: celebration. BJ Fogg talks about this in[ Tiny Habits](https://a.co/d/0h52ZolO). After you do your 2-minute habit, you need to immediately celebrate. Fist pump. Say ""yes!"" out loud. Do a little dance. Whatever works.

This isn't about being cheesy. It's about conditioning your brain to associate the habit with positive emotion. Your brain remembers how things make you feel. If doing your 2-minute habit feels good, you'll want to do it again.

I know it sounds dumb, but it works. Every time I finish my 2-minute meditation, I literally say ""nailed it"" out loud. It's become part of the routine.

# Step 6: Increase Gradually (But Don't Rush It)

Once your 2-minute habit feels automatic, you can slowly increase it. But here's the key: don't rush. Add just one more minute or one more rep. The goal is to keep the habit easy enough that you never skip it.

If you go from 2 minutes to 30 minutes overnight, you'll trigger that brain resistance again. You'll start making excuses. Keep it gradual. In *The Compound Effect*, Darren Hardy shows how small, consistent actions create massive results over time. You don't need to do everything at once. You just need to keep showing up.

# Step 7: Protect Your Environment

You can't build discipline in a chaotic environment. If your phone is next to your bed, you'll check it. If junk food is in your pantry, you'll eat it. Your surroundings shape your behavior more than you think.

Make the right choice the easy choice. Want to work out in the morning? Sleep in your gym clothes. Want to read more? Put a book on your pillow. Want to stop doomscrolling? Delete social media apps or use the one sec app, which adds a pause before you can open distracting apps. That tiny friction is enough to break the automatic behavior.

# Step 8: Reframe Failure

You're going to miss a day. Maybe two. That's not failure. That's being human. The difference between people who build discipline and people who don't is simple: disciplined people get back on track immediately.

Missing one day is just that, one day. Missing two days is the start of a pattern. So when you slip, don't spiral into self-hatred. Just do your 2-minute habit the next day. That's it. Research from the European Journal of Social Psychology shows it takes an average of 66 days to form a habit, and missing one day doesn't reset your progress. Just don't miss two.

# Step 9: Understand This Is a Long Game

Discipline isn't built in a week. It's built over months. But here's the beautiful part: once you've built it in one area, it starts bleeding into others. You build discipline in your morning routine, and suddenly it's easier to build discipline with your work, your relationships, your finances.

Neuroscience research shows that the prefrontal cortex, the part of your brain responsible for self-control, actually strengthens with use. It's like a muscle. Every time you choose the hard thing over the easy thing, you're making that muscle stronger.

If you want to go deeper on this, check out Andrew Huberman's podcast episodes on dopamine and motivation. The guy's a neuroscientist at Stanford and breaks down the brain science in a way that actually makes sense.

# The Bottom Line

Discipline isn't about willpower or motivation. It's about systems. Start with 2 minutes. Make it easy. Stack your habits. Track your progress. Celebrate wins. Protect your environment. And when you slip, get back on track fast.

That's it. No magic. No secret sauce. Just small, consistent action that compounds over time. Your future self will thank you.",1,1771749184.0,Menscomeback,0,1.0,False

He looked nice but there was no real chemistry and fell into the category “grin and bear it”. We kissed and then he started blowing me, before he said “this won’t work”.
