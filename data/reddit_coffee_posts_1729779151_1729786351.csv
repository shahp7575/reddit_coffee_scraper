1gb6d8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1gb6d8c/32_m4f_tx_looking_for_her/,32 [M4F] TX - Looking for Her,"Hello, I‚Äôm a 32 year old Hispanic male living in TX. I currently work as an engineer for a major refinery in the area, so my time outside of work can be fairly limited and I find it hard to make new connections outside of just work colleagues who sometimes go out for drinks. 

To give some history, I recently moved back to Texas late last year. Before that, I was moving around the country for work for about 3 years. First in Oregon, a few months in Iowa, and then in Chicago before making my way back to Texas on a job offer I just couldn‚Äôt turn down. Throughout that time, I‚Äôve found it hard to make connections outside of my current (mostly online) friend group. At first I blamed it on moving around so much. But I had over a year in most places I stayed to go out, get to know the area, and maybe find some connections. So that can‚Äôt be it, right?

I find myself feeling lonely, more now than ever since I‚Äôve decided to stick it out with this company for the long term and make the most of my career that I can here. But even with that loneliness in mind, how do I go about making friends, let along finding a partner now? I don‚Äôt really go out to clubs or party anymore. I go to the gym and a few coffee shops when I have the time, but I doubt you want to be approached by a random man while you‚Äôre doing your workout or working and enjoying your drink. Maybe I‚Äôm too in my own head, I‚Äôm not sure.

So what am I looking for? I‚Äôm looking for a companion to spend time with. Someone I can have plans for dinner with, someone to just mindlessly do nothing in the same vicinity with, to send bad memes to while we sit feet apart. I‚Äôm not looking to have a codependent relationship, been there done that, but to find someone who is stable in their life and knows what a healthy relationship is like. Age isn‚Äôt too much of a factor, to a certain degree, though I would prefer someone who isn‚Äôt going to need me to guide them through early adulthood. 

I am stable enough in my income to be able to support a stay at home partner and be able to fund their hobbies and give us a comfortable life. So if you‚Äôd rather be a homemaker, that‚Äôs fine with me. If you want to work, that‚Äôs fine as well. I don‚Äôt aim to take anyone‚Äôs autonomy away, simply to find someone to share life‚Äôs joys with. I would just ask that if you choose to stay home, please help with some organization and potential cooking when I‚Äôm running a bit too late at the office. 

I want to clarify that children aren't for me. Please don't try to change that, you won't. And it'll just be a really awkward conversation if you try to. 

Do I have physical preferences? Of course I do, I think we all do. My preferences are more with how someone presents themselves and takes care of their appearance more so than specific physical characteristics. My job has certain social functions that I sometimes have to attend and showing up well dressed and well put together can be a big factor in terms of image and perception. And you know what they say? ‚ÄúPerception is reality‚Äù, at least in the corporate world. I want to clarify, I‚Äôm not trying to find a model to date, I just want someone who can clean up nicely when necessary. I know it‚Äôs a vain ask, but sometimes you have to play the corporate game in order to be able to get to where you want to make a difference. 

I want to go ahead and give a disclaimer so that you don‚Äôt waste your time. I am in the larger side at the moment and am working on losing the weight for both aesthetic and health reasons. To give you an idea, I currently weight 260 and my end goal weight is 175. I am working with my doctor, a nutritionist, and a trainer to reach this and have already made progress. But if this isn‚Äôt something you‚Äôd want to be around for, or I‚Äôm just not your type that‚Äôs fine. Please don‚Äôt waste both of our time by making fun of my weight or mocking my efforts to become a better me. I know how easy that can be done through a screen and a keyboard. 

If you actually read all of this rambling mess and any of it resonated with you, shoot me a message and we can chat. No expectations, just a friendly exchanging of words. ",1,1729786223.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

# When it comes to weight loss supplements, it's hard to sift through the noise and find something that truly works. One product that has recently gained significant attention is Java Burn, a dietary supplement designed to be mixed with your morning coffee to help boost metabolism, burn fat, and increase energy levels. But what exactly makes Java Burn so effective? The answer lies in its ingredients.

In this comprehensive Java Burn coffee ingredients review, we will break down the core components of this popular supplement, explore how they contribute to its fat-burning potential, and answer some of the most frequently asked questions about Java Burn. By the end of this article, you‚Äôll have a clear understanding of whether this product is right for you.

[Get yours from the Offical Site here](https://freepage.pro/jupinder/Java-Burn)

# What Is Java Burn?

Java Burn is an all-natural, tasteless powder that you add to your coffee. The product claims to amplify the fat-burning effects of your coffee by using a unique blend of powerful ingredients, all designed to supercharge your metabolism and help you burn more calories throughout the day. The idea is simple: you get the benefits of your daily coffee while enhancing its effects for weight loss and energy boosting.

The key question for many potential users is: **what are the ingredients in Java Burn, and how do they work?**

# Java Burn Coffee Ingredients: What‚Äôs Inside?

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the core ingredients in Java Burn and what makes them so effective:

# 1. Green Tea Extract

* **Benefits**: Green tea extract is well-known for its antioxidant properties and its ability to boost metabolism. Studies have shown that green tea, particularly its active compound, **EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate)**, can increase fat burning, especially during exercise. This ingredient is one of the major contributors to Java Burn‚Äôs fat-burning potential.
* **Statistics**: Research suggests that EGCG can increase fat burning by **17%** and significantly improve calorie expenditure.

# 2. L-Theanine

* **Benefits**: L-Theanine is an amino acid primarily found in green tea that works synergistically with caffeine. While caffeine stimulates, L-Theanine promotes relaxation without drowsiness, which helps to counterbalance the jittery effects of caffeine. This makes your coffee more enjoyable and less likely to cause anxiety.
* **Statistics**: Studies show that L-Theanine can improve focus and attention when combined with caffeine, creating a state of ""calm alertness.""

# 3. Chromium

* **Benefits**: Chromium is a mineral that helps regulate insulin levels, making it an excellent ingredient for blood sugar control. By keeping insulin levels stable, chromium can help prevent sugar cravings and reduce the likelihood of overeating, both of which are essential for weight loss.
* **Statistics**: Chromium has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity by up to **25%**, which can lead to better weight management over time.

# 4. L-Carnitine

* **Benefits**: L-Carnitine is an amino acid derivative that plays a critical role in energy production. It helps transport fatty acids into your cells‚Äô mitochondria, where they are burned for energy. This not only helps with fat loss but also boosts overall energy levels, which is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
* **Statistics**: L-Carnitine supplementation has been linked to **fat oxidation increases of 11-12%**, making it a valuable tool in your weight loss journey.

[Get yours from the Offical Site here](https://freepage.pro/jupinder/Java-Burn)

# 5. Chlorogenic Acid (from Green Coffee Beans)

* **Benefits**: Chlorogenic acid is another powerful antioxidant, found in unroasted coffee beans. This compound is known for its ability to reduce glucose absorption in the body, which can help with fat loss and controlling blood sugar levels. It's particularly effective when combined with the caffeine in your coffee, making it a vital ingredient in Java Burn.
* **Statistics**: Chlorogenic acid has been shown to reduce body fat by **4.4%** in just 12 weeks of supplementation.

# 6. Vitamins B6 and B12

* **Benefits**: These B vitamins play a crucial role in energy production and brain health. By ensuring that your metabolism runs efficiently, vitamins B6 and B12 help your body convert food into energy, keeping your metabolism active and your mind sharp.
* **Statistics**: Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to low energy levels and fatigue, making supplementation essential for maintaining energy during weight loss.

# Frequently Asked Questions About Java Burn Coffee Ingredients

# 1. Can Java Burn really boost fat burning?

Yes! The ingredients in Java Burn are scientifically backed for their fat-burning and metabolism-boosting properties. For example, green tea extract and chlorogenic acid are widely studied for their ability to promote fat oxidation and support weight loss.

# 2. Is Java Burn safe to use?

Java Burn is formulated with all-natural ingredients and is generally considered safe for most people. However, if you have a medical condition or are pregnant or nursing, it's always a good idea to consult with your doctor before starting any supplement.

# 3. How does Java Burn enhance the effects of coffee?

The ingredients in Java Burn work synergistically with caffeine to amplify its metabolism-boosting effects. For instance, L-Theanine reduces caffeine‚Äôs jittery side effects, while green tea extract and chlorogenic acid improve fat burning.

# 4. How soon will I see results with Java Burn?

Results can vary depending on individual factors like diet, exercise, and metabolism. However, most users report feeling more energetic within a few days and notice fat loss after a few weeks of consistent use.

# 5. Do I need to change my diet while using Java Burn?

While Java Burn can help boost your metabolism, combining it with a healthy diet and regular exercise will yield the best results. The supplement works best when integrated into a balanced lifestyle.

We‚Äôve started focusing more on our protein intake as we know that‚Äôs a huge part in losing weight and toning up. 

Before this, trying to even hit 60grams of protein a day was a struggle but now  it became a game for us. Searching for foods that were high in protein and then basing our meals around it. Taking photos of our meals with the protein count and sending it to each other so we could get ideas. 

I found once I made the idea of getting protien in fun, Now I‚Äôm usually hitting 40grams of protien per meal and have noticed a HUGE difference in my cravings AND it‚Äôs not such a daunting  task anymore 

Here is my breakfast today: (I am also following weight watchers) 

2 slices of turkey bacon- 2 points 
2 eggs - 0 points
2 pieces of carbonaut bread- 2 points 
1 cup of Fairlife 0% milk with 8oz coffee and, protein collagen powder - 2 points

Someone witty, genuine, comfortable in their own skin, and just down to earth. 

A little about me:

I work from home full-time. I'd love to share the little mundane details of my day with you and in turn, ask you all about yours and question whether you've eaten today, because, I care and worry a lot lol (!!).

Qualities that are important to me? Hmm, loyalty, consistency; open, honest communication; the ability to make me laugh (hard and often, preferably); patience, kindness, and a genuine desire to learn who I am as a person.

Being self-aware, compassionate, and empathetic are also super important and attractive qualities to me. I try to be kind to everyone I meet. With that said, I was voted most likely to say, ""I wish you the best,"" knowing damn well I hope you go to hell. Life's about balance, not perfection ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

I think I'm an extroverted introvert - I do really well in social settings, but more often than not, I'd prefer just being home in my own space. With that said, I'm always down to travel, checkout new restaurants, museums, aquariums, the zoo, farmers markets, book stores, quaint coffee shops, and the like. In my free time, if I'm not working out or hanging out friends/family, you can find me at a gig of playing a game.

6ft tall. Fit, have dark features, beard, and tanned skin. Educated. Knows which utensil to use for which food (humble brag). Emotionally stable. No kids but definitely the fun uncle.

You are single, kind, preferably remember what life was like before the internet, and text with purpose. I don‚Äôt care what you look like or what you do for a living. Just be yourself, and we'll be good

To preface, this is most likely going to end up as more of a word vomit than a word salad. I'm incredibly terrible at putting things together in a way that makes sense. But here goes anyway. 

Out of a toxic relationship in May. Almost immediately into a new one in July. Things on that front WERE incredible. And now I just feel like another failure. 

I know what you're thinking. I moved on too fast. And that may be true or may not. My current partner has been so giving and has taught me a lot that nobody else has had the opportunity or ability to. But that leads back into how I'm feeling. 

I don't know how to take initiative. Yes, I clean. A lot. I do laundry. I clean the toilet and the floors and the bathroom. I do dishes, I change sheets, I have coffee ready the night before so I have to get up and flip a switch. 

But I feel useless. I feel lazy. I expect direction all the time because I simply don't know what to do. I had to step away and do some paperwork after dinner last night, and felt incredibly guilty because I wasn't around to help with the rest of the family. We both have kids. And I didn't find it fair for her to be the only active parent in the household. It's like I'm always on alert, and it's probably due to being conditioned as such over my life. Which is something i need to work on in therapy. 

We also have a VASTLY different view on parenting, and we got into a pretty big argument (we were raising voices at each other, and I had made a pledge with myself that I wouldn't put myself in that position again. Unrealistic? Maybe. But it's not productive) because her 6 year old lost his shoes, and then sat in the corner while everyone else looked for them. I expected him to be more involved looking, they were his shoes, and nobody in life is ever going to throw something in your lap and do everything for you. I guess it's principle I was getting at. 

My son is ADHD and 8, and I was onto him for goofing off instead of getting his stuff done first. I'm not angry that he wants to be crazy, I just don't want there to be an ""I forgot"" when it's time to walk out the door. 

I feel wrong. For everything. I feel like my words are absolute garbage. I feel like none of my emotions or wants or expectations are ever met. I feel like i just float through the ether every day with no clear purpose, which brings up a conversation we had a week ago. 

Who the fuck even am i? Why the fuck do i deserve to deal with this shit so much? Life has NEVER been a cakewalk, I've always had to struggle. Where's my peace? Where's my happiness? Why is everything so damn hard? Am I just broken? Is my mind backwards? Do i need to forget everything and relearn from another angle? Do I need to ask for medication? 

Shit i don't even know what to talk to my therapist about tomorrow. After signing paperwork and setting an appointment I felt nothing but shame for HOURS following. Idk. I feel unhinged and broken. Idk what to do. I hope this helps but I just feel like im already damaged and can never get better. I don't feel like anyone can truly be here for me because I suck.

It took till the second injection to get results. But since then down to about ~7 headaches Needing painkiller a month from nearly continuous. 

The migraines worsened markedly in the summer, and recently they seem to have almost stopped (Yay!!!!).

It has only been a couple of months, but there doesn't seem to be much consensus on when and how to stop the CGRPs. I've had one headache needing painkillers, and that was too much decaf coffee at 4pm which had me awake at 3am, so kind of self inflicted, the coffee there is pretty suspect anyway.

The main advice seems to be wait till 6 months, so we know it isn't just ""luck"". I've had a mild ear infection for a bit and sometime infections make me feel better?!? Antibiotics literally in the post.

So come the new year, if I continue with so few headaches till then, I presume check my Triptan stash, and don't refill the prescription? Any tips? Anything I should know? 

I'm dimly aware that CGRPs don't always work when restarted üò¨

The local regulator has approved Rimegepant, is that worth asking for, instead of Frovatriptan, assuming I get some episodic or chronic migraines after stopping (I mean I got migraines occasionally before they went chronic).

As for what worked after 4.5 years of chronic migraine I'm not sure (and it might still be the ear infection). I drink less coffee, I've stopped alcohol entirely, I've upped my folic acid supplementation, and improved my sleep hygiene, stopped using computer monitors as much, one or more of those.

I retired my trusty Sette 270 yesterday after 7 years of happy use. I remarried a couple years ago and the Mrs. was definitely not happy with it though. The dreaded Sette jet engine noise was simply too much for her. She finally put her foot down a few weeks ago and gave me an ultimatum. My gorgeous¬† Atom 75W was the result of the compromise. :)

I have been watching the broader grinder market the past couple years waiting for GBW to be more mainstream in the offerings and I had pretty much settled on this grinder. My plan was to wait until after the holidays, but hey when the wifey says do something about that noise, what's a good husband to do. I pulled my first shot with it this morning expecting to burn through some coffee trying to get this thing dialed in. Much to my surprise the very first pull came out perfecty, 18g in / 36g out in 27s. Exactly what I aim for. The best part when I ground my second shot so the lil lady could see/hear it in action, she got a big smile on her face and said wow, that changes the entire vibe in the house this morning with the lack of that jet engine taking off. It's super quiet and very fast. A bonus win for both of us is I am able to retire two of my countertop contraptions - that godawful (her words) WDT tool and my dosing funnel. I'm a very happy camper and it was my wife's idea to boot! Oh the output...that first cup was wonderful, very balanced and a lightness to it that I didn't recall from the Sette.

There‚Äôs a woman on my team about ten years older (nearly 40) than me and is the senior-titled position above my role. She is an absolute nut.

From the get go she seems neurotic and fickle in her disposition towards me. First day, she gives me a lecture about how much easier I‚Äôll have it in this field than her due to me being a man. This little rant ended with her in tears. Next day, she‚Äôs telling me how emotionally intelligent I seem and how well I‚Äôll do in my career. She continues throughout the next weeks to shift between being extremely encouraging, condescending, and straight up insulting. I‚Äôm usually left dumbfounded by the things she says and does.

She often refers to me as her assistant in meetings and zoom calls behind closed doors, which I can hear due to being beside her office. This seems pretty intentional, as the noise is usually pretty muffled. She dumped a coffee in the water cooler drain which was left to mold, which she openly admitted to blaming me for when it was just us in the office. She‚Äôll routinely call me the wrong name, often calling me her husband‚Äôs name, both in meetings and one-on-one conversations. One Friday, when smoking a cigarette on my front porch after work, she drove past me and gave a wave. Having kept my habit a secret, I dreaded her inevitable gossip of this (not too much, I‚Äôm nearly thirty, fuck it). However, the following Monday, she proceeds to openly, loudly tell our office that she witnessed me go into my apartment with a ‚Äúscantily-dressed blonde‚Äù. This lie came out of nowhere and can‚Äôt even be excused as a misunderstanding, no-one was around me at this time. Thankfully, the glances my coworkers gave me indicated they were just as uncomfortable with this as I was. 

At the end of the day I‚Äôm here for two more months. I otherwise enjoy my job and like my team. However, this person is senior to me, a wealth of knowledge, and someone who has given me access to meetings and advice I otherwise would not have had access to.

Too many teachers are leaving the profession with fewer new teachers joining their ranks. The Ministry of Education is predicting that as early as 2027 we could start seeing a gap in available teachers and the number of students. If this continues we could see an already burdened education system stretched to its limits.

The current Minister of Education Jill Dunlop says that this looming crisis will be addressed by dealing with absenteeism as well as shortening the time for teaching candidates to get in front of classrooms.

Our guest today though has a different viewpoint. Karen Brown is the president of the Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario. Previously she was on to discuss the issue of violence against teachers in the classroom. Today she joins us to expand on that topic and discuss why Ontario has enough teachers. Just the province isn‚Äôt stepping up to the plate to make the profession attractive to the qualified.

I get it, the Army hates broken Soldiers. And discourages profiles, but would it be too difficult to make a scale for the alternate events? I was gonna do the minimum and take my time on the row, since it doesn't matter if I finish with 1 minute to spare, or 10 minutes to spare. The beast in me wouldn't allow that, so even though I could only get 60, I gave it my all, to see how well I could do. I finished the row in 21:24. I'm allotted 33:48. 

 Before I was injured I could nearly always max my run, never getting below 95. Even with my injury, before I got my profile, I could hit 72 points for the run. It sucks, because I used to love running, and can't quite do it anymore without needing a week to recover from just running one mile.  I'll shut up though, I appreciate my profile and I'll take my stupid 60 points, because I would like to be able to walk around with my grandkids if I ever have any.

* **Simple workflow with a quick warm-up**: I need something that‚Äôs straightforward and fast, not just for myself but also for some regular family guests who are espresso lovers and are not willing to wait 30 min for it.

* **Machine choice**: I first considered the Ascaso Duo, but I‚Äôve read too many stories about reliability issues. Now, I‚Äôm leaning towards the Silvia Pro X, and I think I could manage a 15-minute warm-up, which is borderline acceptable for me. Smart plugs could be adequate for mornings but not when we have some around.
* **No weighing**: I‚Äôm not interested in weighing every dose or making coffee preparation a science project.
* **Grinder**: I‚Äôm considering the Eureka Mignon Silenzio or Specialita, which can grind by timer (and hope to get +/-1g accuracy. Should I go for something more precise like the Libra? Is the exact mass it worth it?
* **Optimizations**: What other tips do you have to streamline the process without making it feel like I‚Äôm doing a ritual every time?

Lastly, I live near the Italian border, and most bars here serve solid 7/10 shots or better. For those of you who‚Äôve mastered home espresso, did it ruin the experience of getting a coffee at a bar for you? I‚Äôm curious if that‚Äôs something I should prepare for.

We had great conversation, but every time I tried to flirt she didn't match the energy. Looking back she clearly wasn't interested enough in me, and that's okay, it happens. 

However, an hour into the date, she checks her phone and makes something up about having to go to a birthday party (it's Tuesday and she hadn't mentioned anything about this before).

‚ÄúThe average among your colleagues is fifty hours a week, and Janis works nearly seventy, you are simply not worth the salary we‚Äôre paying.‚Äù

Dread pools in my stomach, as I scramble to think of some argument for why they should keep me employed.

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ I am aware of your situation.‚Äù For the first time I can remember, a small smile graces her face, ‚ÄúI can¬†*smell*¬†your desperation.‚Äù¬†¬†I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about that.¬†¬†‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre on notice.¬†¬†You will be removed from all your current accounts, and will need to follow my instructions to the letter.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶Understood, I‚Ä¶‚Äù I inject as much sincerity as I can into my voice, ‚Äú*appreciate*¬†this opportunity.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course. We have representatives from ATXL Tech coming in this afternoon, you‚Äôll be in charge of preparing for the meeting.‚Äù¬†¬†What? Wonderful, this sounds like a bit of promotion.¬†¬†She continues, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be cleaning the boardroom, thoroughly.¬†¬†Vacuum the chairs, wash the cups and glasses, and prepare fresh pitchers of water and coffee.¬†¬†Also empty all the trashcans in the boardroom and bathroom.‚Äù

I open my mouth to protest, but smartly reconsider and clamp my mouth shut.¬†¬†I nod and stalk out of the room.¬†¬†I track down a janitor to awkwardly ask for cleaning supplies.¬†¬†It‚Äôs pretty stupid to have¬†*me*¬†waste my time cleaning and vacuuming chairs, but¬†*whatever*.

An hour later, Helen actually lets me attend the meeting, although I have to stand in the corner the entire time.¬†¬†Once ATXL‚Äôs representatives leave, she immediately closes and locks the door. Turning to me, ‚Äúnow Mr. Crow, I need you to find hairs, skin, and oils,‚Äù she orders.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you cleaned the room thoroughly, it should be a simple task.¬†¬†Mr. Abramson used his water glass, so I may be able to get something from that.¬†¬†You will check the chairs first.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?¬†¬†Why?‚Äù

She stands a bit straighter and glares, ‚ÄúYou are to follow my instructions, not¬†*question*¬†them.¬†¬†Don‚Äôt you¬†*want*¬†this job?‚Äù¬†

I keep my mouth shut, take the plastic bag she hands me, and begin scouring the chairs.¬†¬†A half-hour later, she scrutinizes my findings and tells me to meet her back at the office later that night.¬†¬†Then I was done for the day, and it was barely past 1PM.

Driving home, all I can think about is what to tell my parents.¬†¬†My mom hasn‚Äôt held a job in forty years, and my dad hasn‚Äôt been able to work since he injured his back.¬†¬†I have to support them.¬†¬†My health insurance is the only way my dad can afford physical therapy and painkillers.¬†¬†But‚Ä¶ I guess I still have a job?¬†¬†As long as I keep picking up hairs for Helen, or whatever other weird assignments she‚Äôll give me.¬†¬†Still, how will I explain this?¬†¬†If I tell them I‚Äôm ‚Äúon notice,‚Äù they‚Äôll freak out.¬†¬†In the end, I decide to kill time by hanging out at the mall, and running a couple errands, so they won‚Äôt get suspicious.¬†¬†

Once I‚Äôm home, my late evening meeting looms over everything.¬†¬†Ironically, my parents are proud when I tell them I‚Äôll have to go back to the office after our family dinner, ‚ÄúWow, the boss is finally noticing what a hard worker you are,‚Äù my dad says patting my back.¬†¬†The guilt from keeping my parents in the dark gnaws at me.¬†¬†What would he think if I told him the truth?

Driving back to the work my mind whirls thinking about what Helen might have in store for me, more cleaning?¬†¬†Or actual work this time?¬†¬†Walking from the parking garage to the office I‚Äôm bursting with nervous energy.¬†¬†Whatever Helen has planned, I can‚Äôt screw up.¬†¬†Soon enough, I find myself back in her windowless office, standing in front of that ominous desk.¬†¬†Helen is wearing deep crimson robes, almost the same color as her hair, instead of her usual business attire.¬†¬†and slowly stroking the masks on her wall.¬†¬†In the dim lighting it almost looks like the masks are shifting in response to her touch.¬†¬†I shut the door behind me.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou have one task tonight Mr. Crow, and I expect you to follow my instructions¬†*perfectly*.‚Äù¬†¬†She pushes on a panel in the wall, and a doorway appears.¬†¬†‚ÄúFollow me.‚Äù

I feel an inkling of panic as she disappears into the dark passageway.¬†¬†I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs something¬†*nefarious*, but could she be interested in me in¬†*that*¬†way?¬†¬†As I walk down a flight of stairs towards a dimly lit room, I‚Äôm weighing the pros and cons of agreeing to something like¬†*that*.¬†¬†My fantasies evaporate when I see what‚Äôs actually in that dark room.¬†¬†

‚ÄúIs that‚Ä¶ Ian?‚Äù¬†¬†He said he was being transferred, but here he is, strapped to a stone altar with a number of tubes leading in and out of his body.¬†¬†He is covered in a patchwork of bandages, but his face is still bare, and his signature glasses are lying on a metal cart next to him.¬†¬†The sole spotlight illuminating the room is centered directly above the altar.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI said no questions.‚Äù Helen is behind me.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing to‚Ä¶‚Äù my jaw drops when I turn around to respond to Helen.¬†¬†She‚Äôs removing her face.¬†¬†Carefully peeling off the edges to reveal a pair of lidless, blue eyes glaring out above the empty indentations where her nose and mouth should be.¬†¬†The mouth moves on the mask in her hands, ‚Äú*No questions*.‚Äù¬†¬†She shifts and her robe drops revealing a completely smooth, featureless, and ungendered body.¬†¬†

I freeze in place.¬†¬†My heart pounds in my chest as I debate what to do next.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhile I prepare the tincture, I need you to remove more skin him.‚Äù She places her face down on a low, end table holding a hand mirror.¬†¬†It‚Äôs within arm reach of a cushioned chaise lounge.¬†¬†Their dark color almost blends into the inky darkness of the room.¬†¬†The face continues to talk as her body reaches up and pulls off her hair, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter where; you just need to cut out¬†*enough*.¬†¬†About one square foot.‚Äù¬†¬†She sets a wig of long, auburn hair down next to her face.¬†¬†

I can‚Äôt move.¬†¬†I‚Äôm barely breathing.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWell, don‚Äôt you want to keep your job?‚Äù¬†¬†She asks as her body walks off into the shadows.

‚ÄúB-b-but, Ian‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhat?¬†¬†Would you like to take his place?‚Äù

I wince, and slowly walk over to Ian.¬†¬†His eyes are closed and his breathing shallow.¬†¬†I pick up the scalpel from the metal cart.¬†¬†It was lying right next to his glasses.¬†¬†Ian bought me lunch one time and went on a long rant about how hard it was to find those glasses.¬†¬†My eyes burn.¬†¬†Ian is just a nobody, right?¬†¬†I don‚Äôt remember him talking about a wife or kids.¬†¬†No one else at the office has mentioned him for weeks.¬†¬†Does anyone even miss him?¬†¬†I squeeze my eyes shut as I make an incision on the sole stretch of bare skin on his torso.¬†¬†Besides, this is coercion or something right?¬†¬†I‚Äôll just report this to the police when I get out and everything will be fine.¬†¬†He can still recover.¬†¬†Ian‚Äôs skin easily pulls away with a gentle tug, and I choke as bile fills my mouth.¬†¬†It burns my throat as I swallow it down.¬†¬†Lifting the skin up I realize I cut out far too much.¬†¬†Did I doom Ian?¬†¬†I turn around to find Helen laying down on the chaise.¬†¬†

Her face speaks up from the end table, ‚Äúlay the skin over my head.‚Äù

I carefully drape it around her head. It slithers and squirms about, swiftly forming a perfect match of Mr. Abramson‚Äôs face.¬†¬†Helen sits up, and her entire body has changed.¬†¬†She‚Äôs taller, older, paunchy, and clearly masculine.¬†¬†She now perfectly resembles Mr. Abramson, down to the patchy hair on his shoulders.¬†¬†The only exceptions are the thick folds of excess skin around the edges of her face, and her immutable, cold, blue eyes.¬†¬†‚ÄúWonderful, Mr. Crow.¬†¬†I‚Äôm glad you aren‚Äôt as squeamish as Ian was.¬†¬†Keep this up and you‚Äôll have a wonderful future ahead of you.‚Äù

She picks up the mirror and checks her new face, murmuring, ‚Äúit seems Mr. Abramson was well informed, this will make negotiations¬†*much*¬†smoother.‚Äù¬†¬†She waves me away with her other hand.¬†¬†

I stumble my way out of the room and back out of the passage.¬†¬†Could I do this again?¬†¬†I stand in her office and stare at the faces behind her desk.¬†¬†Could I help her make more?¬†¬†What would my parents do if I quit?¬†¬†What would Helen do if I went to the police?¬†¬†

I decide to do the right thing, and I‚Äôve almost left the room before I stop in my tracks.¬†¬†I recognize one of the masks on the wall.¬†¬†I get closer.¬†¬†Nose to nose.¬†¬†My own eyeless face stares back at me.

No.¬†¬†I can‚Äôt escape.¬†¬†This is my life now.",1,1729784278.0,SpooktacularTales,0,1.0,False

# Frugal Living Tips #5: Reduce Energy Consumption

https://preview.redd.it/28t0ouby1qwd1.jpg?width=3734&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=161188bcf1dbf8140f1f4af902170e9c56844748

Ever feel like your energy bills are soaring higher than a rocket? By reducing your energy consumption, you can not only save money, but also contribute to a greener planet. Let's explore some easy ways to power down your bills and live sustainably!



**Why Save Energy?**

It's a Win-Win for Wallet and Planet! Every kilowatt saved translates to lower energy bills, putting more money back in your pocket. Additionally, by using less energy, you reduce your carbon footprint, combating climate change and promoting a healthier environment for all. It's a win-win situation!



**Frugal Energy Saving Methods. Turning Down the Heat (and Costs):**

Here are some practical frugal living tips to get you started:

* **Embrace the Thermostat Tango:** Adjust your thermostat by just a few degrees. Every 1 degree lower in winter and higher in summer can save you up to 10% on your heating and cooling costs.

* **Sealing the Leaks:** Check for air leaks around windows and doors and seal them to prevent drafts and wasted energy.

* **Unplug Power Vampires:** Electronics draw energy even when turned off. Unplug chargers, appliances, and electronics completely when not in use.

* **Embrace LED Power:** Swap traditional incandescent bulbs for energy-efficient LEDs. They last longer and use up to 90% less energy.

* **Wash Clothes Wisely:** Wash clothes in cold water whenever possible and air-dry them instead of using the dryer.

* **Shower Power:** Opt for shorter showers and consider installing a low-flow showerhead to reduce water usage and energy needed for heating.



# Frugal Living Tips #6: Frugal Living Tips 8: Harness the Power of ""Want"" vs. ""Need""

https://preview.redd.it/mwssp6092qwd1.jpg?width=6240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe1635449f43aabf64f68d2aef092d3b91e6a226

Have you ever experienced regret after making a sudden purchase? Distinguishing between ""wants"" and ""needs"" can be tricky.

Mindful spending is a journey, not a destination. Start small, be patient with yourself, and celebrate your progress. Every ""want"" you resist is a step towards financial freedom and a life aligned with your values.



**Why Tame the ""Want"" Monster?**

* **Save Money:** Impulsive spending is a major budget drain. By curbing it, you free up funds for important things, like debt repayment, savings goals, or future experiences.

* **Reduce Stress:** Financial regrets and overspending can lead to anxiety and stress. Mindful spending promotes financial peace of mind and a sense of control.

* **Align with Values:** Prioritizing needs over wants allows you to invest in things that truly matter and support your long-term goals.



**Guide to Mindful Frugal Spending:**

* **Implement a ""Waiting Period"":** Before buying something non-essential, impose a waiting period (e.g., 24 hours, a week). Often, the urge fades, saving you money and preventing regrets.

* **Ask Yourself the Hard Questions:** Is this a ""need"" or a ""want""? Will it truly add value to my life and align with my long-term goals? Does it fit my budget?

* **Consider Alternatives:** Could you borrow, rent, or find a cheaper alternative? Could you use the money saved towards something more meaningful?

* **Focus on Experiences:** Invest in experiences that create memories and enrich your life, rather than material possessions that depreciate in value.

* **Visualize Your Goals:** Regularly remind yourself of your financial goals (e.g., dream vacation, retirement) and how each purchase impacts achieving them.

","A simple cup of liquid ecstasy may be made from coffee beans with the correct technique, making coffee brewing a delicate tango between art and science. Coffee lovers can discover a world of flavors thanks to the innumerable brewing techniques that are available, each of which delivers a distinct flavor profile and experience.  
The drip brew is one of the most widely used techniques and is frequently found in cafes and homes. It uses a coffee machine to provide a smooth, balanced cup, combining consistency and ease of use. The French press provides a full-bodied, rich experience for individuals who enjoy doing their own brewing. The French press produces a strong brew by steeping coarsely ground coffee in hot water, which extracts strong tastes and vital oils. Strong tastes are extracted by steeping coarsely ground coffee in hot water.

Pour-over techniques, such as the V60 or CEMEX, prioritize control and accuracy. By using these methods, the brewer may control the temperature and flow of the water to produce a clear, fragrant cup. Pour-over is beautiful because it brings out the unique qualities of single-origin beans.  
Many coffee aficionados prefer to make their own espresso for a more intense experience. This technique produces a concentrated shot with a lot of taste and crema by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee under high pressure. Espresso is a mainstay of coffee culture and the base for many beverages, such as lattes and cappuccinos.

Because it has a smoother, less acidic taste and is ideal for hot days, cold brew has grown in popularity. It creates a pleasant and adaptable beverage by steeping coarsely ground coffee in cold water for a long time.  
In the end, experimentation and personal choice are key components of the art of coffee making. There are countless options just waiting to be discovered, as each method offers unique tastes and experiences, guaranteeing that every coffee enthusiast will find their ideal cup.",1,1729784074.0,u_Sensitive-Clerk-3520,0,1.0,False

1gb5gzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/1gb5gzz/the_big_twist/,The Big Twist,"Did anyone call the twist of Elliot being abused by the end of the first season? I unfortunately saw that coming as soon as it was revealed Elliot had DID. 
Here is why I called that twist. 
When we first get introduced to Elliot he takes down Ron (Rohit Meta who changed it to Ron when he bought his first Coffee Shop six years ago.) And we all know what he did. 
So I immediately took notice that was his first target that we see him take down. In a world of crime, drugs etc where violence is quite prevalent. We see him take down the perverted sicko above all others. 
So fast forward to the end of the season. And we find out Mr Robot and Elliot are two personalities. My immediate thought was ""oh my god his dad had done something terrible to him as a kid"". By this point we have seen what an unreliable narrator Elliot was, and how he had NO bad memories of his father (apart from the one). So my brain immediate connected the dots to that conclusion. So in season 4 I sat there and was like. Well I saw that one coming a mile off. (I didnt however see the other twist of the MM)  

So my question is did you all see the twist? Or were you shocked? I'm rather curious. If you did call the twist what tipped you off? 

So a tiny bit of personal info here. I have studied psychology since I was a child as I grew up with a psychologist and criminologist. As well as have degrees in Psychology. So yes I know how most DID personalities are formed, what traumas and such, can make it manifest. So I did have the tools to break it down and come to that conclusion.

The kind of infestation that you can't fight on your own, no matter how clean of a person you are (and I was raised by a clean freak). I probably bought and threw away 4 or 5 regular coffee pots since I couldn't keep the bugs out of them for good.

I hadn't seen any bugs in/around the machine so I thought it was safe. I was so, so wrong. Fast forward to today, I've ran vinegar water through it a few times and can still see a bug inside the machine, along with the mess it's made...there are no bugs in the house so I know it came from the apartment.

In my country (Italy) we have always had voter IDs and it has never been a controversial issue, so the topic has piqued my curiosity.

The only counter-argument I've heard so far for voter IDs is that it *could* make it harder to vote, mostly due to the small fee required to get an ID. 

In Italy we also have to pay a small fee to renew our IDs (‚Ç¨22.21), but, as they last for 10 years, you would only need to save up the price of 2 coffees per year (~‚Ç¨2), which is ridiculous compared to what you actually need to live (between food and rent).

From my research on the topic, the fees are similar in the US (~30$) and there are fee waivers for those who can't afford an ID. Furthermore, even the states with the strictest voter ID laws offer free IDs for those who can't afford them and usually have mobile ‚ÄúID stations‚Äù to allow people who can't go to the DMV to still obtain an ID.

Voter IDs would increase election security, or at least the public perception of election security. They would also make it easier to track down cases of election fraud, as you'd have more evidence than just a CCTV image of the culprit entering a polling station. Furthermore, given the (recent?) debate on election fraud, wouldn't voter IDs shut down the whole debate, making both sides happy?

I understand that this is a controversial topic in the US, however, I don't really understand *why* that is the case, as the benefits seem obvious while the negatives appear quite hypothetical.",0,1729783801.0,changemyview,45,0.43,False

1gb596k,https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/1gb596k/why_sgi_is_a_dangerous_cult/,"""Why SGI is a dangerous cult""","This is a comment from a while back - I thought it was really good:

As a former member, this is my take on why SGI is a dangerous cult.

The way chanting works on a physiological (hormones) and psychological (state of mind) level is that it makes your brain release hormones making you feel great, loved and loving, and, at the same time, you‚Äôre putting yourself in a slightly self-hypnotic state.

This happens regardless of the context and content of the chanting (you can chant to your hot cup of coffee and repetitively say anything you like, and the same thing will happen).

Being in a self-hypnotic state (even a slight one) makes you suggestible to anything anyone tells you or you experience.

SGI's claims about why and how chanting works has absolutely zero merit and starting a meeting with Gongyo (including chanting) is nothing more than a well-understood method used deliberately to prime you for brainwashing.

Here are a few examples of what you will learn as a member of SGI:

- When anything good happens in your life, it's only because you're a member. If you stop being a member, not only will good things stop happening, but really bad things will also start happening. You will suffer severely and eventually come crawling back, begging for forgiveness (according to Ikeda). You will learn to live in fear of even thinking about leaving.
- When anything bad happens in your life, it's all your fault. It's because you're not chanting enough or doing enough activities for SGI. However, bad things happen in life no matter what you do. Following SGI‚Äôs teachings will teach you to live in fear of not chanting, always make you feel like something is wrong with you, and that you're not good enough.
- You will find it both normal and desirable to do SGI activities 3-6 times weekly, thereby completely isolating yourself socially from non-members, including friends and family.
- People who are not members are deluded and must be converted. All non-members, including friends and family, are potential targets for conversion. Normal human interaction becomes impossible.
- Friends and family who are not members and are concerned about the way you WILL change and all the time you will spend away from them, are per SGI definition classified as ""evil friends"", so are, in effect, your worst enemies. You will feel it completely reasonable to isolate yourself from the people who genuinely care about you and love you.
- The more obstacles you meet, the closer you are to a breakthrough, so, suffering is happiness. The more you suffer, the better, because the more you need SGI.
- Any non-SGI approved writings are dangerous and will give you bad ""karma"". You will learn to reject and distrust any non-SGI material and information.
- Critical thinking and normal functioning reasoning skills must be suspended. You will learn not to trust yourself, but only SGI and their leaders.

You will find these ""teachings"" constantly encouraged and facilitated at every meeting and event, by leaders of every level, and when you eventually begin to experience these things and dare question them, you will most likely hear something to the effect that it‚Äôs your ‚Äúfundamental darkness‚Äù at play, as the organisation is perfect, but members are flawed.

If this is what you want, then SGI is for you!

However, I strongly advise you to think again and consider if joining SGI is the best use of your valuable time. - by [Tosticated](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/spo0b6/can_someone_briefly_explain_why_you_consider_sgi/hx3n5qz/)",3,1729783451.0,sgiwhistleblowers,0,1.0,False
1gb58m0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gb58m0,Confused: Does it exist in store? Being replaced? Weird tech glitch? Am I crazy?,"I'm hoping people more in the know than I am might be able to clarifying what's making me feel crazy recently!

A few weeks ago, I ordered the Milano Luna for the first time and, in doing so, discovered a brewed cup of Starbucks coffee that I actually enjoyed! (Usually I go with iced dopios because the brewed coffee tastes too burnt for me.) So I've been ordering it frequently since I saw it's limited edition.

After the first visit, it showed up as ""Not sold at [my store]"" in my order history. I was bummed but ok, maybe it ran out extra fast because it's limited edition. And if I search in the app, it only pulls up a bag of coffee beans. But if I go directly to Hot Coffees, I can order it there. When I do, which I can do successfully!, it shows up immediately in my order history as ""Not sold at my store.""

When I've gone into the store (98% of the time I order through the app), I've noticed that it's rung up as Caff√® Verona (and does taste off, but maybe I'm imagining things). I asked a barista about it one morning, but they assured me they had it in stock. Then it was rung up as Caff√® Verona, which I didn't notice until halfway through the day.

Am I insane? Is there just not an in-store button, which is why it's being rung up in-store as Caff√® Verona instead of Milano Luna? Is there a reason it shows up as not sold in my store, even though it originally lets me order it through the app anyway? Am I getting the same Caff√® Verona regardless of what I order? This has all been through one store because you gotta love a well-worn commute path.

Anyway, just very baffled, and might hop ship back to the doppio because it's all very challenging pre-caffeinated and very ultimately silly, but I *would* still low-key like to understand what's going on! ü´†‚òïÔ∏è",4,1729783411.0,starbucks,7,1.0,False

I'd always idealized $100k and up salaries as the amazing ideal - the promise of the master's degree and in the Midwest (specifically) that didn't seem to be a promise people like me ever saw fruition of.

However, I had always paid attention to how people who make those salaries behave, how they delegate their work, and how they handled management of a large staff of people. I knew managers at the big Uni who had 5 units of managers under them over five departments of 10-25 employees each. And they often handed out gifts, gift cards, provided morale events, raffle items, and professional development that went above and beyond the gift bag/spa experience.

My revelation: 

* **Gifts, Gratuities, and General Morale boosting efforts were often baked into those high salaries and expected that a person making said salary would be giving X portion to do so!**

I'd always dedicated a portion of my meager earnings to buying simple gifts for staff - pizza, birthday cakes, water, and candy for staff when I could. It is just those actually effected my budget. I assumed at some point I'd attempt to write it off in my taxes, but I was fuzzy on the concept.

Because naturally TRIO funds can't buy those nice, fun things for staff. (And you'd wish HR would step up and go back to the fun times where we did a birthday cake or a monthly birthday-day for staff.)

It breaks my heart (now) because then my highly-paid boss could give out 50$ gift cards or a thankful parent could give me a $20 coffee card at the end of a long semester or even a scented candle, but I can't give my staff gifts regularly (and in fact I have some debt because I have been generous because I like to share.)

In the future:

1. Gift cards and bonuses give to everyone on the staff - provided by our local businesses and bigger stores to improve everyone's lives and drive traffic into their places of business. 
2. More morale events and incentivizing morale events - put the funnest people in charge. You know who they are. Find the divas. Find the karaoke people. Set up an Xbox or PlayStation by a big TV. Pop on a racing game or Dance game. 
3. More morale in morale events - my big Uni threw a good party; I'll give it that. My big business job - they gave us dividends yearly on our profits.  Zoom sent me a huge box of gifts for Zooming with them. It certainly cheers up a bleak existence. 
4. A morale budget. I can dream. HR throwing down a bit just for TRIO programs out of the big pool.
5. More guidance how to responsibly use Professional Development to improve morale and team bonding with TRIO funds.",1,1729783332.0,TrioWorksUSA,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm looking for more balanced takes. Parenting is an adjustment for everyone and I want to slowly work towards making things better!!!

My husband works full time, I don‚Äôt I am on maternal leave.

I do:
- all the feeds. Since three months he‚Äôs refused the bottle but I did all the feeds prior anyway 
- diaper changes while husband is working (WFH)
- early mornings - I am with baby since 6am wake ups to bedtime and then do night feeds 
- all the naps barring a few times when he‚Äôs helped 
- some dishes 
- feed and play with our cats 80% of the time he does other 20% (I feed them in the morning when I‚Äôm up)
- i order some groceries once in a while 
- I pay for a cleaner to come 2x a month (we both had equally decent paid jobs prior to my maternal leave). 

He pays for the very expensive mortgage, takes on the mental load of groceries, dinner, knowing what needs to be refilled (I‚Äôve never purchased diapers, wipes etc). He pays for our plane tickets for a friends wedding, bulk of the groceries, is present for weekends etc. is with the baby for a couple hours in the evening (needs to cook or run errands otherwise). He does the bulk of the house maintenance which something is always needing to be done - fixing or installing things as we have an older home.

Our LO is still working on being put down for naps. So that means I‚Äôm ‚Äútrapped‚Äù for a while in the nursery holding him in the dark because now he‚Äôs 4 months and fights sleep. My husband gets a lot more sleep than I do and it‚Äôs been a struggle asking him to wake up on weekends also.. like today he‚Äôs working but I‚Äôve been up since 6 and he‚Äôs still asleep at 8am. If he was up a little earlier he could help refill my coffee or tea or maybe get me a snack or whatever or help in some way like if I need the bathroom. 

I just can‚Äôt understand if this all seems fair to you all because I really don‚Äôt know myself. Since I‚Äôm on leave it is a bit hard to say I shouldn‚Äôt be doing so much and also I don‚Äôt really want to suddenly cook dinner I‚Äôd rather look after the baby because he feeds every couple of hrs anyway. 

I just don‚Äôt get a lot of downtime - I barely have time to shower. I barely get three meals a day. I‚Äôm pretty sleep deprived.

Also.. the other day my husband was actually off work.. and I was sick.. and he left to go get some things done but left for 3+ hrs with no check in not a single text. He accomplished a ton‚Ä¶ got a lot of stuff done that needed to be done (nothing urgent though that couldn‚Äôt wait till I was better) and I am still upset about it.. I just can‚Äôt understand who would leave their sick wife and child alone for 3 hrs plus without even a single text. Idk..

I‚Äôm White William Sanctum, your neighborhood country boy and part-time conspiracy enthusiast, and I‚Äôve decided to enter the wild world of blogging. Now, I‚Äôm not entirely sure what I‚Äôm doing, but I hear this place is perfect for sharing ideas and uncovering the TRUTHS the government doesn‚Äôt want us to know! So, let‚Äôs get started!

# What is A Blog?

First things first, let‚Äôs figure out what this blog thing is. I think it‚Äôs sort of like shouting from the rooftops, but instead, we're sitting at our computers (or in my case, me and my brother Jonas' secret bunker) and typing out our thoughts. The idea is to reach folks who might not be listening on the streets or at the local cafes, breakfast restaurants, diners, and museums where I usually talk about aliens, bigfoot, and government surveillance.

# Who Am I?

For those of you who don‚Äôt know me, I‚Äôm White William. I live in Cincinnati, Ohio, where I live in a pretty little house‚Äîdoing target practice in my back yard, drinking cola, farming corn and tomatoes in my garden, doing research on the cryptids, playing Star Wars Battlefront with my brother, walking around the city with my brother, and much more! My spare time is mostly devoted to my passion for uncovering truths and sharing the weird stuff that‚Äôs bubbling just under the surface of our everyday lives!

# What Do I Plan to Write About?

Here‚Äôs where things get interesting. I‚Äôm planning to cover everything from alien encounters (I have some notes on Area 51 that are sure to blow your mind), to how you should always keep your windows locked‚Äîbecause you never know when the ‚Äúmen in black‚Äù might come knocking, right? I will also be sharin' my knowledge on bigfoot, the loch ness monster, aliens, yeti, slenderman, snake monsters, parasites, the giants of the South, and just about everything else that will keep you safe from the dangerous conditions of the outside world!

Also, I want to help you all understand the dangers of fluoridated water and the hidden messages in children‚Äôs cartoons. Have you noticed how often the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù are actually FBI agents sent to spy on us? We‚Äôll unravel that mystery together.

I would also like to share my favorite topics! Do some crossposting about banjos, soda, riding mowers, farming, firearms, food, bicycles, parks, camping, gaming, and just about anything else I'd like!

# How Does This Work?

Now, I‚Äôm not sure how often I‚Äôm supposed to post or if there are rules about blogging‚Äîso let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôll write when the spirit moves me! Feel free to join my subreddit, and keep those comments rolling in! And yes, I plan to share some of my own conspiracy theories (or FACTS, depending on who you ask) and hopefully get some discussions going.

# Conspiracy of the Week: Is Your Coffee Watching You?

Speaking of topics, let‚Äôs kick things off with the¬†**conspiracy of the week**: Is your coffee watching you? That‚Äôs right, folks. It turns out those little RFID chips in our coffee cups could be collecting data on us. Who‚Äôs drinking what, and at what time? Could the ‚Äúcoffee break‚Äù be just another ploy to keep us under surveillance?

Keep an eye on your morning brew‚Äîdon‚Äôt let those government satellites know you take cream and sugar!

# Closing Thoughts

So, there you have it‚Äîa glimpse into the mind of White William Sanctum and what you can expect from this blog. I might need some help figuring this whole thing out, so if you have tips on blogging or techy things, shoot ‚Äòem my way‚Äîbut be careful! You can never be too cautious with information.

Let‚Äôs embark on this wild ride together, and remember: the truth is out there. Are you ready to find it?

Until next time, stay alert, stay skeptical, and always keep a weapon and jar of peanut butter on hand!

Hugs And Kisses, White William

In as short as possible: we (both in our early 40s) were in a 3 month relationship (had exclusive talk etc..), I can speak for myself and say i was definitely falling for her. Then one day she breaks up. Queue a few weeks of trying to make sense of it. Occasional messages back and forth, until about 2 weeks after I see her on a dating app (she'd used her mental health and needing space from dating as a part of the reasoning for breaking up). I called her out and got an excuse about contacting a friend through the app who had changed their number,  for advice about our situation. I was accused as the asshole for calling her out and told any future us was now dead for sure.

I started dating, moved on, got my head straight again until I wake up a few days ago to a message from her (I've been in a 4 month relationship till now) asking how I am, and she's sorry her feelings changed. I replied kinda irritated asking what she wanted from the message because our last contact was pretty damning. Also, I was clear I couldn't be friends with her back then. Again, I'm made out to be the asshole because she says she was just trying to be nice. Queue more messages back and forth where I'm still the asshole and getting blocked left right and centre, but at the same time I'm suggesting we meet for coffee like adults and just stop this stupid bickering across texts because its just escalation every time. No response to that message yet, if she even got it. To me this is childish and ridiculous. What do you folks think?

**I stumbled upon an old, ornate wooden box with strange carvings on the lid tucked away in the back of my closet behind a small door. I had never noticed the door before, let alone the box just inside. As I surveyed the box, I finally decided to open it despite feeling hesitant. Inside, I found a small, intricately carved whistle made of something pristinely white, possibly bone. The whistle had a strange, pungent smell like it was freshly carved.** 

**The design was confusing; it was just a small whistle, but carved into it were images of woodland animals: a fox, a bear, and what I assumed was a deer. The animals all looked normal except the deer, which was up on its hind legs. I found it very odd, but possibly the carver was just running out of space. When I picked it up, I felt an inexplicable sense of unease. Something about the whistle didn't feel right.**



**Despite my reservations, I decided to keep the whistle. I put it back in the box and closed the lid, thinking that was the end of it.**



**But it wasn't.**



**The first time it happened, I woke up in the kitchen, with no memory of how I got there. I stood by the sink, staring out the window into the darkness. I had no idea what I was doing there, or how I had gotten out of bed. I stumbled back to my room, feeling disoriented and scared.**



**It kept happening. I would wake up in strange places, with no memory of how I got there. I would find myself standing in the middle of the living room, staring at the TV. I would wake up in the bathroom, with the shower running and no memory of turning it on.**



**I began to feel like I was losing my mind. I couldn't sleep or eat, and I was constantly on edge, waiting for the next episode to happen. Then, I started to notice something strange. I would find odd marks on my body, such as scratches or bites, and my clothes would be torn or dirty with no memory of how it happened.**



**That's when I started to suspect that something was seriously wrong. I was sleepwalking, but it was more than that. I was doing things while I was asleep, things that I couldn't remember.**



**I had a doctor's appointment scheduled for the following week. When the date came, I told the doctor about my sudden sleepwalking issue and the strange places I had woken up in. He asked if I had been taking any new medications that could be causing this.**

 **I told him no, and he nodded and told me he would write me a prescription that might help. He prescribed something called Estazolam. I took the medicine that night. To my horror, it made the sleepwalking worse. That night, I woke up nude standing at the edge of the woods behind my house.** 

**I was shocked and embarrassed as I ran back to my house. The house was still locked, and I frantically looked around until I noticed the living room window was open. I climbed back through, face-planting on the floor. I gathered myself and got back to my feet. Standing in the living room, I noticed something odd. The box from the closet was on the coffee table open.** 



**My heart dropped as I staggered over to the box and looked inside. The whistle was gone! Where could it have gone? Had I taken it with me on my naked jaunt to the woods? I had so many questions and zero answers. As the days and weeks dragged on I tried my hardest not to sleep, However after a few days of not sleeping time did this horrible thing where it seemed to stop and hallucinations took over. It started small seeing shadows in my peripherals, and then I could feel the shadows watching me.** 



**Eventually, the shadows no longer hide themselves and just stand there. Mocking you as if you can't see them. I couldn't hold out any longer and that evening I took the medicine the doctor had given me and passed out on the couch. That evening I didn't sleepwalk but, I had what I would call a dream but, it felt more like a memory. I could see myself standing nude at the edge of the woods.** 

**In front of me was a shadow, I call it a shadow because in the dream I couldn't recall its face only it was tall and thin with pale skin covered by what appeared to be animal hides. In the memory, I could see myself handing the thing whatever it was the whistle. I could see it touch my mouth with its long pale finger and blow the whistle. The sound it made was so horrifying like a train whistle but, more like screams many screams and loud, So loud that it woke me up!**



**That morning I could feel it inside me, crawling under my skin. I could feel its presence.**



**I'm writing this now, trying to make sense of what's happening to me. I know that I'm not myself anymore.**



**I don't know how much longer I can resist. I can feel it growing stronger, taking over more and more of my mind and body.**



**I'm trapped in my own skin, unable to escape.**



**I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to hold on. Its is getting stronger, and I'm getting weaker.**



**I'm not sure what will happen next. But I know that it won't be good.**",2,1729781795.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Oct. 24, 2024 at 10:00 AM
","NOTE: Tilray has Energy Drinks and likely receiving more thru Medmen IP

Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) has agreed terms to acquire energy drink and sports nutrition business GHOST, bringing one of the category‚Äôs fastest growing brands into its expanding energy portfolio.

KDP is paying $990 million for an initial 60% stake in GHOST ‚Äì representing supplement arm GHOST Lifestyle and its drink business, GHOST Beverages ‚Äì with the remaining 40% to be acquired in 2028. The deal is expected to close in late 2024 or early 2025.

‚ÄúGHOST is a differentiated brand with significant growth potential, and we are excited to partner with its founders to take the business to the next level,‚Äù said KDP CEO Tim Cofer in a press release. ‚ÄúThis acquisition strengthens our position in the attractive energy drink category, accelerating our portfolio evolution toward consumer-preferred, growth-accretive spaces through a disciplined deal structure.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe energy category is poised for continued long-term growth, which KDP expects to increasingly capture through our platform-based approach,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúKDP‚Äôs portfolio of complementary energy brands is aligned against distinctive consumer need states, and, together, these offerings will unlock significant growth and scale benefits across our entire DSD portfolio.‚Äù

Co-founders Dan Lourenco and Ryan Hughes are staying on with GHOST and will operate as part of KDP‚Äôs U.S. Refreshment Beverages segment.

‚ÄúWe could not be more excited to build the future of GHOST together with KDP. As we thought about our company‚Äôs next chapter, KDP‚Äôs track record of cultivating disruptive brands, similar challenger mindset, and shared vision for the energy category and beyond made it the right home for our brand and team,‚Äù said Lourenco. ‚ÄúWe are excited to pair KDP‚Äôs insights and capabilities with our products and people and know that together we will continue to scale and build GHOST towards our vision of a 100 year brand.‚Äù

Quick Take: While GHOST‚Äôs acquisition isn‚Äôt a total surprise to industry watchers, Keurig Dr Pepper as the buyer is.

For starters, KDP‚Äôs acquisition means the end of GHOST‚Äôs relationship with Anheuser-Busch InBev (A-B), a minority investor and the brand‚Äôs energy drink distribution partner since 2018. According to the release, KDP plans to invest ‚Äúup to $250 million‚Äù in buyouts to transition GHOST on to its own network of trucks. That means ‚Äì once again ‚Äì beer distributors nationwide will have a gap to fill in their portfolios, creating potential opportunities for another set of young brands to take advantage.

When reached for comment this morning, an A-B spokesperson stated: ‚ÄúWe were recently informed that GHOST has reached an agreement to sell all of its businesses to Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP); we will work with KDP throughout this transition while continuing to focus on driving growth with our portfolio of industry-leading brands.‚Äù

And yes, obviously, this underscores KDP‚Äôs ambition to grow strategically in key categories like energy. It‚Äôs unclear what this means for Nutrabolt, makers of C4 Energy, one of GHOST‚Äôs closest competitors amongst a cohort of surging next-gen energy brands. KDP made headlines by taking a minority stake in Nutrabolt (30% for around $868 million) and bringing C4 on to its trucks in 2022. On the strength of agreements with popular IP licensed from Hershey‚Äôs and other candy brands, C4 has emerged as the fourth best-selling brand in the category behind Red Bull, Monster and Celsius: in the 52 weeks through Sept. 6, the brand has grown 44.5% (around $738 million in sales) in total U.S. MULO plus convenience, according to NielsenIQ. KDP‚Äôs ability to keep the brand growing through its network should give confidence that it can do the same with GHOST, which generated around $632 million in sales during the same period.

Jefferies analyst Kaumil Gajrawala pegged the transaction at about three times Ghost‚Äôs 2024 sales. The acquisition and other distribution agreements would give the soft drink giant about 6% share of the overall energy drink market.

That‚Äôs not all, either: GHOST‚Äôs acquisition also comes ahead of another energy drink debut ‚Äì this one from Black Rifle Coffee Company, as previewed at NACS earlier this month ‚Äì which will be going on KDP trucks starting in January 2025. Those arrive as another energy play, A Shoc, is being phased out.

While the details remain to be sorted, one thing is clear: KDP‚Äôs commitment to growth via M&A and strategic investments remains strong as ever.

Then after that (about a week later) they asked that I conduct a performance task (took about a week total to review. Then by early October they asked to schedule another interview post performance task. THEN they asked for an in-person coffee informal interview this past Tuesday. 

Overall just extremely lengthy process for this position and I‚Äôm starting to grow antsy in my current job. I really hate my current job and was kind of putting all my eggs in one basket for this position I‚Äôve been interviewing the past 2+ months for. 

However, after I had the informal coffee interview on Tuesday they said they‚Äôd get back to me by early next week because they‚Äôre ‚Äústill reviewing all the candidates‚Äù. 

Also wanted to mention that I drove from San Diego all the way to Inglewood for this informal interview (with traffic it was 5+hours total drive). They knew it was going to be a lengthy drive for me. But they still haven‚Äôt given me their decision and to hear that there‚Äôs still other candidates honestly does aggravate me. 

Should I email them and ask for a decision sooner? Maybe leverage another position or offer I may have?

Then, I realized I'd never be able to.  ","I first learned about the job at *Pharm* when I was picking up my subscription. The woman behind the counter included a pamphlet in my order. As she slipped it in the paper bag, she said looking at it would be the best decision of my life.¬†

‚ÄúLooking at that pamphlet?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúHow much do you pay for these pills?‚Äù she asked.¬†

I laughed, a little taken back.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you know that?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI just paid you.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a rhetorical question,‚Äù she said, smiling.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what rhetorical means,‚Äù I said, taking the bag. ‚ÄúBut, I‚Äôll play along‚Äî$400 for 14 pills.‚Äù

She nodded.¬†

‚ÄúAnd what is that a week?‚Äù she asked.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs $400,‚Äù I said, getting annoyed.¬†

Again, she laughed. If she wasn‚Äôt so pretty, I would have been upset. But she had a movie star look about her‚Äîbig blue eyes, flowy hair, perfectly white teeth. I didn‚Äôt know what she was doing working the counter at a pharmacy.¬†

‚ÄúThat must be debilitating,‚Äù she said.

I shrugged. It was, but I didn‚Äôt want to show it. I only made $600 a week. But, without the pills, my organs will slowly stop working. The disease I had was new, but not rare‚Äîin the last ten years, it grew from a few odd cases to nearly 3% of Americans. *Gastroenteritis*, which was a fancy way of saying my bile was deteriorating the organs around my stomach. Like many other people, I developed it after taking a, now recalled, daily vitamin called *PharmChew*. I originally went on the vitamin because my doctor recommended it. I took it every day for a year, but then I started feeling sick. When I went back to the doctor a year later, he told me I had developed *Gastroenteritis.* The best cure for my ailment was another *Pharm* product‚Äî*PharmiCure*.¬†

As long as I took two *PharmiCures* a day, I could go on to live a long, financially poor life. ¬†

The pharmacist leaned in toward me, snapping me out of my daydream. She looked like she had a secret to share.¬†

‚ÄúRead the pamphlet,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTrust me. It changed my life.‚Äù

The role advertised in the pamphlet was some kind data entry position, which wasn‚Äôt too far from what I was doing currently. The pay was pretty good, but the biggest perk was that all employees got free medication. On top of the $900 I‚Äôd be making a week, I‚Äôd get back that additional $400. As I typed up my application, I thought about all the things I‚Äôd do with that extra money‚ÄîI‚Äôd get to be able to finally *enjoy* my newfound health.¬†

After I submitted the application, I got an email 30 minutes later. I got an interview. Then, I got a second interview, then a third. By that same time next week, I had the job. I was ecstatic.¬†

All of the interviews had been over the phone, so my first day at *Pharm* was also my first time seeing the office. I had to go to a parking lot by the airport and wait for the shuttle, which then took me *another* hour south. When we reached, what looked like, the front gate, someone came out of the security booth and inspected us. He checked our pockets, work bags, and then took all of our temperature. When he was finished, he made us stand in a straight line next to the van. He had horrible posture and eyes that were never looking at the same thing. His voice was deep and gravely.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre clear,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut remember, you gotta pass through here on the way in *and* out. This is a high security facility.‚Äù

We all agreed, then shuffled back into the van to enter the actual complex.

In the parking lot, we all got out and made our way toward the entrance. The building was boxed and massive, its siding covered in black, reflective windows, making the whole thing look like a haunted Rubik‚Äôs cube. Around us were acres upon acres of field‚Äîno highway, neighborhood, or Starbucks in sight.¬†

Inside, a bubbly woman greeted us and gave us a gift bag. I looked inside mine. There was a *Pharm*\-branded journal, some candy, and two bottles of pills. I looked up, a little taken back. I‚Äôd never gotten medicine at an onboarding before. When I looked around, everyone else was pulling out the pills too, inspecting them.¬†

‚ÄúRemember,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúall medication must be taken inside the *Pharm* facility.‚Äù

A guy next to me raised his hand. His armpit was dark with sweat.¬†

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt we supposed to take one in the morning and one at night?‚Äù he asked.¬†

‚ÄúWhat about weekends?‚Äù someone else asked.¬†

The woman smiled.¬†

‚ÄúOf course, your concerns are all valid,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the employee provided medicine is restricted. If employees took them home then, well, we wouldn‚Äôt be able to ensure that the company provided medicine was going to company employees.‚Äù

We all looked at each other. It was annoying, but I could see her logic. Someone might just work here for the free pills, then sell them on the street.¬†

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt come here on weekends,‚Äù someone else said.¬†

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù the woman said, her smile immovable. ‚ÄúWell, employees can buy additional pills for a 30% discount, which you can do for weekends. *Or*, you can come in, work a little, get your pills, and enjoy our complimentary Saturday and Sunday brunch.‚Äù

A few of the people groaned, but no one challenged her anymore. There would always be complications with any job, I thought. At least at *Pharm*, I‚Äôd make good money, get free medicine, and be able to enjoy the peaceful scenery. My old job was in the middle of the city, which only seemed to exasperate my *Gastroenteritis.*

My first day of work kept getting better and better. They gave us free breakfast and lunch, plus unlimited coffee and kombucha. Since I was dealing with sensitive information, I had to work in an enclosed office, which wasn‚Äôt too bad. I had a big window next to my desk where I could look out on the rolling fields. Every once in a while, the woman who checked us in would come by and drop a snack on my desk or bring me some water. At my last job, I was lucky if I got a free cookie the day before Christmas break.¬†

I didn‚Äôt understand what the data I was sorting meant. Each hour I would have to sort through 25 or so names, checking their ‚Äúhealth conditions‚Äù and looking for outliers. It had their blood pressure, dietary restrictions, weekly exercise, etc.‚Äînormal stuff you would learn at an annual check-up. Then, depending on how they scored on the ‚Äúhealth‚Äù scale, I would drop them into one of three buckets: Vitamin 342d, Vitamin x871, or Vitamin 636e.¬†

It didn‚Äôt make sense to me, but I figured it was above my paygrade. All I had to do was check the data, drop the names in the right folders, then move on to the next.¬†

When it hit 4PM, I saw my next order of names come through‚Äînow it said 50. Weird, I thought. It would be difficult to get 50 names done before 5PM, but I decided to give it the college try. I worked fast, analyzing the data as the time crept up, closer and closer to when I was supposed to leave.¬†

As it hit 5PM, I still had ten names left. I worked quickly, funneling the last of my work into the appropriate folders. As the clock hit 5:16PM, I grabbed my stuff, ran down the hall, and made my way to the shuttle stop.¬†

But, as I got there, the shuttle was gone. There was a dozen of us standing there, mostly the same people from the beginning of the day.¬†

‚ÄúDid we miss it?‚Äù a man asked.¬†

I shrugged. ‚ÄúThere must be another one,‚Äù I said.¬†

There was a schedule up by the door. I looked at the times. There at the bottom, it had a note in slightly smaller text‚Äî*Last shuttle leaves 4PM, next shuttle arrives 7AM.*

I went back and relayed it to the man. His face got flushed.¬†

‚ÄúI only paid for the babysitter until 7,‚Äù he said. He moved past me, yelling out ‚Äúhello‚Äù into the empty hallways.¬†

The person at the front desk was gone. All the hallways were empty. I walked up and down them a few times, but every door was locked.¬†

I went back to my office as the others kept yelling, running throughout the building like hungry mice. I tried not to bring that level of stress into my life‚Äîif I did, my *Gastroenteritis* would act up. Instead, I sat down in my chair and took a long, slow breath.¬†

‚ÄúYou missed the shuttle,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThere will be another one tomorrow.‚Äù

I closed my eyes to try and calm down. When I opened them again, the woman from my orientation appeared in the doorway. She had a tray of food in her hands. I stood up and approached her.¬†

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI missed the shuttle.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúDid you need to get back to the city for something?‚Äù

I shook my head.¬†

‚ÄúNo, I mean, just like‚Ä¶ life,‚Äù I said.¬†

I looked at the tray she was holding. It was steak, potatoes, and broccoli, with a beer, can of soda, and a single pill on the side.¬†

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúwhatever you do at home, they probably have here. Video games. Sports. Television. There‚Äôs a room for everything. Plus, the nicest sleeping quarters you‚Äôve ever seen. Come with me.‚Äù

She placed the tray down on my desk and motioned me to the door.¬†

As we walked, she pressed her key card onto different doors, pushing them open and revealing, as she described, every activity under the sun. The people who I‚Äôd passed in the hallways were all still here‚Äîengaged in this or that.¬†

‚ÄúYou see,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúif you ever need to leave early to go home, you can take a little PTO. Unfortunately, PTO doesn‚Äôt kick in until after the end of the first year. But, if you manage to get your work done early, you are welcome to try and catch the shuttle before it leaves.‚Äù

I stopped walking. All of a sudden, I felt faint. She realized I had stopped following her and stopped, but didn‚Äôt turn to face me.

‚ÄúHow often do people go home?‚Äù I asked.¬†

She kept facing forward.¬†

‚ÄúAs much as they‚Äôd like to,‚Äù she said.¬†

‚ÄúWhat if I don‚Äôt finish in time to make the shuttle?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always the next day.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what if I miss again? What if I have a funeral, or a birthday party, or it‚Äôs Christmas?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are always welcome to use PTO,‚Äù she said. ‚Äú*Pharm* promotes work-life balance.‚Äù

My throat felt tight.¬†

‚ÄúMaybe this isn‚Äôt a good fit,‚Äù I said.

Now, she turned to face me. She frowned, but I could still see the smile behind it.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut, I do want to be 100% clear on something, because clarity is a *Pharm* promise.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said, taking a step closer to me, ‚Äúnow that you have seen *Pharm* data, it will be more difficult to purchase *PharmiCure* as a non-employee.‚Äù

My fingers felt numb. The words weren‚Äôt quite landing.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a legal issue,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNow that you understand the more intricate parts of our business, obtaining this medication as a civilian would possess certain risks.‚Äù

‚ÄúRisks?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou spent the whole day in our system,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMaybe, you saw something that could help you reverse engineer our products. Maybe, you have the means to now develop a dangerous street drug version of one of our products.‚Äù

‚ÄúI inputted data.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were within our system,‚Äù she said.¬†

I shook my head, taking a step back. I imagined the rolling fields around the complex‚Äîhow long would it take me to run back to society? A few days? But what happened when I got there? Without *PharmiCure*, the pain in my stomach would worsen every day until, someday soon, the bile would leak into my organs. I‚Äôd die a long, slow, miserable death.¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you mean ‚Äòmore difficult to purchase‚Äô?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that illegal? You can‚Äôt ban me from getting medicine.‚Äù

The woman nodded. She did her best to portray sympathy, but she just looked tired.¬†

‚ÄúWe would never ban you from getting life-saving medicine,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHowever, most people receive an integrated rebate on their medication‚Äî$400 for 14 pills is technically a discount that we give to all non-risk customers. If you become a *risk* customer, you no longer get the rebate.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the non-rebate price?‚Äù I asked.¬†

She smiled.

‚Äú$40,000 for 14 pills.‚Äù

We stood there for a moment, the faint sound of ‚Äúactivities‚Äù spilling into the hallway. I imagined all the people like me behind those doors‚Äîparticipating in the hobbies of the living, thankful to have intestines that weren‚Äôt folding in on themselves.¬†

I thought back to those original *PharmChews*. When the doctor first recommended them, he told me it was *very* important to take one a day. *Be sure to never miss a day*, he said, smiling. The reaction didn‚Äôt start until three months in.¬†

I imagined what they were called originally‚ÄîVitamin 345r? Vitamin 221w? Vitamin d783? Who was the poor soul who dropped my information into that folder? Were they still trapped behind these walls?

‚ÄúSo this is it?‚Äù I asked, my throat almost too dry to speak. ‚ÄúThis is my life.‚Äù

She took a step toward me. Now, the facade seemed to wear off a little. For a moment, she almost looked like a real person.¬†

‚ÄúListen,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI was in your boat once too. I had panic attacks for three weeks when I started here. But, it‚Äôs really not so bad. With my PTO, I can go visit my parents three times a year. I always save a few hours for when the State Fair comes through. I even take a night to watch the kids walk around on Halloween night. I find that‚Äôs all I really need of the old world. Here, I have a husband. I have *hobbies*. I eat delicious meals every day. And, I‚Äôm *healthy*. Isn‚Äôt that the most important part?‚Äù

I shook my head, unable to bring myself to speak. My whole body felt tingly.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù she said, grabbing my hand and guiding me back to my office. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna want to eat that steak before it gets cold.‚Äù",6,1729781446.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

I need help understanding and making my heart understand that it‚Äôs OVER.

Why did he gave mixed signals? This is truly holding me back, how can he say he loves me while he is breaking my heart! That‚Äôs not love.

He said friends -> he is trying to feel better about the break up and soften the blow

He said coffee -> what for? I told him that if he changes his mind he can contact me, he knows he‚Äôs not blocked 

He said we can try in the future -> why not now? 

As you can see, I have been trying to get myself back to earth, so I dont know what else to do.

I‚Äôve been doing 65-hour rolling fasts, and I wanted to check if anyone knows about potential risks.

When fasting, I only drink black coffee, zero-calorie electrolyte powder, magnesium glycinate, and potassium gluconate supplements.

I‚Äôve been having bad bowel movements after eating again, so I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences or knows if this could be a real risk.

1gb46kd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppIdeas/comments/1gb46kd/need_someone_to_discuss_about_my_app_idea/,Need someone to discuss about my app idea,"I‚Äôve been thinking about an app that helps you meet your needs through people living in your area, such as your neighbors or anyone nearby.

1.) Shopping Feature
Uber Eats and Deliveroo are great services for getting groceries and food delivered. However, what I‚Äôm thinking is different: it allows people around you to do your shopping without high fees or needing to be a courier. For example, instead of paying multiple fees for delivery, service, and couriers, you could use the app to ask your neighbors for help.

Imagine opening the app and seeing a map showing your neighbors‚Äô needs:

	‚Ä¢	One person might want to do a quick ¬£7 supermarket shop but doesn‚Äôt want to go out due to bad weather. They open the app and create a request for someone nearby to help.

	‚Ä¢	Another person who‚Äôs already going to the supermarket and wants to earn a little extra money can pick up the items for ¬£1-¬£2. There‚Äôs no minimum order or high delivery fees like with the bigger apps. It‚Äôs about earning extra money by doing something you‚Äôre already planning to do.

This could extend to:

	‚Ä¢	Picking up a prescription from the pharmacy
	‚Ä¢	Collecting a package from the local post office
	‚Ä¢	Dropping off dry cleaning
	‚Ä¢	Picking up lunch from a nearby caf√©

2.) Getting Help from Locals
This could include:

	‚Ä¢	Handyman services
	‚Ä¢	Small transport help
	‚Ä¢	Short-term assistance, like helping with moving
	‚Ä¢	Quick tasks, like taking out the garbage (especially for those who might need a little extra help)

3.) Dog Sitting Feature
I‚Äôd like to add a dog-sitting feature, provided I can ensure strong security measures (such as ID verification, FaceID, video uploads, and live tracking). This would allow people who are too busy to walk their pets to pay someone nearby to do it. But, this requires working closely with the government for verified IDs, and the AI system would need to work smoothly for security.

4.) House Services (Cleaning, Cooking, Laundry/Ironing)
As a student, I know cleaning can be a hassle, and I think others feel the same way. People could pay someone nearby to clean their house, do their laundry, or iron their clothes. Security regulations would be in place to ensure trust. Other services could include:

	‚Ä¢	After-party cleaning
	‚Ä¢	Plant watering
	‚Ä¢	Outdoor garden cleaning
	‚Ä¢	Detailed house cleaning
	‚Ä¢	Cooking, cleaning, drying, and ironing as a package

5.) Local Game Events
If you want to play basketball but don‚Äôt have friends to join, this feature lets you participate in local group events. For example:

	‚Ä¢	Join a local game or tournament
	‚Ä¢	Nature walks
	‚Ä¢	Morning walks (which could be sponsored by local coffee shops)
	‚Ä¢	Football, volleyball, and other games",0,1729780724.0,AppIdeas,5,0.5,False
1gb46h6,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gb46h6/5_struggles_and_5_good_things_about_my_first/,5 struggles and 5 good things about my first start-up ,"I spent 13 years in financial service enterprises (Banks, Investment Service Providers).

Got 1st redundancy in Dec 2022.

Got 2nd redundancy in July 2024.

Miserable at last job.

Started own business in Jan. Juggled 9-5, then lost the job and went full time in my growth consultancy biz.

**Struggles of doing 9-5 and solo biz:**

1. Juggling both = insane amount of time and self inflicted stress (obvious I know!)
2. Couldn't prioritise or focus enough to 'move the needle'
3. Day job work suffered (which I'm not too bothered about)

If you're like me (anxiety, depression etc), do not recommend.

But I needed to start *something* in the darkness of British winter to give myself some hope. I knew 9-5 life wasn't for me any more. So I'm glad I did, otherwise I would've been behind financially and growth-wise when I lost the job.

If you thrive off constant work and can be 'on' all the time, then you'd do better than I did. There are millions that do!

Then, July happened.

I got the dreaded HR person added to my weekly 1:1. I saw it an hour before. I knew the game was up - and paced around my block. It was something *I'd kind of wanted*, but now it was happening I rapidly went through the 5 stages of (professional) grief, and joined the call with a delirious smile.

They must've been perplexed. And pleased.

I went full time in my biz, and managed to increase my total revenue from $3k to $18k, and 3-4x my MRR. There's been peaks and valleys, but the extra time has allowed me to really nail my ICPs, what they like, and how to reach them.

However. I want to be honest:

**Struggles of double hatting then going solo (from Jan to now)**

1. **Not documenting everything sooner.** Was done for me in 9-5 to a degree. I wasn't used to it and assumed I could get by with the 'knowledge in my head'. Wrong.
2. **Not 'networking' enough + feeling lonely:** Didn't make effort to connect with people in my space, or with ICPs early enough. Or not being a part of a maker community earlier.
3. **Time management.** More time has had the opposite effect to my 'productivity'. I've found my days to be loosely structured - which is part of the reason I wanted out of 9-5 so much. But this has come at the detriment of feeling a bit lost, meandering, and demotivated (on occasion).
4. **Not clear on my own definition of success.** I switch/ed to often on this. A certain MRR threshold. Freedom to work elsewhere. Being excited. All are important, but I focus on 1 too much and lose sight of what success means to me. I've changed that recently (more below).
5. **Wider relationship impacts.** Not being able to focus or be present with gf or friends. Looming ominous presence and fear of losing everything I own (mortgage, pride, etc) if this 'doesn't' work out and I had to suck it up and go back to 9-5. This meant reduced and poorer quality time with people. Again, I've changed this..

**Changes and good stuff of being solo:**

**1. Started documenting my processes / lessons / insights / 'ahas':**

* I use a mix of Google Word + ChatGPT + recording every step of every project I do for next time. If I try something different, it gets written down in a free format Gword doc.
* Tactiq is also super useful for calls - it transcribes and outlines summary + actions.
* My main source of inbound is via content, helping first, and referrals via quality work. Without documenting and analysing weekly what worked / did not - I was aimless. I'm now able to see what people respond to, what their real pains are, and help them properly.

**2. Improved my time management / daily structure:**

* Listing my 'manager' v 'maker' activities.
* Manager = essential (sales calls, metrics tracking), maker = needle pusher (deep client work, content campaigns, video series, newsletter).
* A whiteboard. Daily and weekly priorities. A google sheet with my strategy, priorities, 3-9 month aspirations, ICP details, CRM. Monthly, weekly, daily metrics. Oh, and prioritising MVP metrics. Cutting the noise.

**3. Improved Networking and reduced loneliness**

* Joined 2x founder / entrepreneur communities. I'm genuinely being active.
* 1st benefit is feeling more part of something, and not as lonely.
* 2nd is indirect exposure: Had 1x inbound and 2x referral by doing this. A nice byproduct.

**4. Defining my definition of success:**

* Figuring this out still. Financial freedom, ability to travel, and helping others achieve great things for their own businesses all spring to mind.
* Sprinkling even just 1% of fun or excitement in my daily routine e.g. Taking a traditionally boring industry of business / growth consulting, and adding my own flair. A coffee. A reward for every milestone.

**5. Improving my relationships quality:**

* Leaving my phone on the side when with gf / friends. Planning things again. Being excited. Telling and hearing stories.

The signature scent I cannot live without!

Recently I thrifted a small sample size bottle of perfume from a local thrift store for 3 dollars. It's in a cute little pink bottle, and is called ""Spring Jasmine"" by a brand called ""Wild Spirit.""

Now I already know I smell good in jasmine, so it seemed like a safe buy to me, so I spread some on the pulse points of my wrists and neck, and put it in my cart. Then, before I even left the store, things started to happen!

I was also purchasing a table to refinish, and as soon as I began to pick up the table (which was perfectly easy for me to lift, I'm in good shape and it was just a coffee table,) a man came running from nowhere and offered to carry it to the front for me. He carried the table and pulled my cart full of thrift-finds behind him. I wasn't done looking around, so I thanked him, and he expressed that I was welcome, and went on his way. Once I had snagged enough swag that my cart was full, it really was going to be heavy and require multiple trips. As I was checking out another man made a beeline right for me as I was leaving, offered to carry the table, and when I reached for the cart he said, ""Don't you worry about that sweetheart, I've got it."" He carried my table to my car, put it in the back, and went back to get my cart and loaded all of that into my vehicle for me. He introduced himself, and chatted me up, and kept grinning like a schoolboy.

Friends, I go to this thrift store every week, and have never been treated like this! Neither of these men were employees, so they had no customer-service type of motivation. (Employees do not typically take things to my car for me, and at stores where I'm a regular they already know I'll be moving the furniture around, and never help.)

I went to another nearby antique place and was immediately set-upon by a guy with a cute dog, who insisted his dog loved me, and wanted to go home with me, that I was special and he needed to know my name. When checking out of the store the clerk started telling me all about how he and his cat need a woman around.

When I got home my boyfriend was all over me. He loves me, but we've been together for years now, and he started acting all romantic and seductive in a way that really isn't our day-to-day normal anymore.

I do sometimes experience pretty priviledge, but not like this! So I experimented. I started wearing it to work. One of my bosses who previously seemed to hate me (as in insulting me while talking to my coworkers) treated me nicely all day, maybe even a tad sweetly. Multiple patients told me I was beautiful. Colleagues that often ignore me chatted me up all day. I feel like our intern was flirting with me openly.


I found magic in a bottle!!! I didn't know a signature scent could do this for a person! Am I crazy? Can perfume really induce pretty-priviledge like this? I once heard a stripper say she earns way more money when she wears Delina, and another say she earns more when she wears choco musk. Is this what they mean? Have you experienced this? Have you found ""The One"" that causes a nearly alarming amount of male attention? (Or attention from your prefered sex.) Nothing seems special or extraordinary about this little perfume, it just works great on me. Is this what's truly supposed to happen when you've found your signature scent? I have to know if any of you have been chased-down like this as a result of a fragrance!

Pylori treatment with eradication of bacteria,"Recently, in March, I had a quadruple therapy for H. Pylori, which the doctor identified during an endoscopy along with follicular gastritis. After several months following the treatment, all the symptoms disappeared, as did the follicular pattern, and the only thing that remained was ""chronic erosive gastritis."" Then, in July, the nausea returned, and the gastroenterologist performed another endoscopy with mapping, taking 6 biopsy samples. According to the results, the bacteria were eradicated, but even 8 months later, the erosive gastritis persists despite continuing to take PPIs and domperidone.

Is this normal?   
It seems unlikely that the bacteria is still alive since two endoscopies with multiple biopsy samples were done. This makes me think there might be something else.

He triggers my trauma. Of bullying. Of people telling me I‚Äôm not good enough for so long. I went hiding into my house for 10 years, gaming, just to not have to face reality.

And now I‚Äôm coming out and volunteering and such to better my life. They even want to help me get an education.
But this thing is really stuck inside of me. I said ‚Äòhi‚Äô today, and he looked at me like ‚Äòhow dare you even say it‚Äô.

My perfectionism triggers my autism when I‚Äôm with him, wich causes a vicious circle of being overstimulated. The only way I would be able to talk to him, is by not trying to be perfect. But I still have trouble doing that.

So i think i might be ment to be single for life as every time i dip my toes into dating it goes horribly.

Im on 3 different dating apps and i honestly hate them despite the fact i keep using them. I get a maybe a match every other week if i use the apps every day and 80-90% of the time the following happens. We exchange ""how are yous"" and I make some small talk and try to get to know her and after 3-4 responses i get ghosted. Many times when they do respond in the first place i have to be the one to show all the interest while they can give short responses and never ask my anything. Is this a normal experience to have as a guy on these apps?

Beyond apps there have been only 3 girls i have gone out with at least once over the past 3 or so years.

Girl 1 was a tinder match and went to my college. She was busy a lot of the time so we ended up mostly texting. We did go on one date and things seemed to be going well but her responses got slower, eventually getting to the point she would take 2-3 days to answer a simple yes or no question. I broke things off with her as i didnt see things going anywhere.

Girl 2 worked at coffee place i frequent and she wrote her number on my recipt one day. We texted then went out about a week later. Things went good and about 1.5 weeks after that she invited me to her dorm room and we talked for a while. She was really talkitive and i was ok with this, im shy but i made an effort to talk back and add things because i really liked here tbh. A few days after this she said suddenly she isnt interested in me anymore. I was sad and asked why and if i did something wrong and she said i was ""dull and boring in person"". I broke contact with her after this and im still confused on how i should feel. She was talking the ENTIRE time i was in her dorm room, idk what she expected me to do beyond me adding and responding to what she was saying like i did.

Girl 3 i matched with on bumble the past summer. I really liked her and we saw a movie together. After the movie she drops a bombshell that she is going away and wont be able to go out for a few months. I didnt think things would work out due to this since we had just started talking so i broke things off. A few months later she messaged me again and said she was back so we started talking again. I invited her to my dorm to stay the night and all was going well till, out of nowhere, at arround 1am she said she hates in my dorm and wants to go home. Mind you i told her i had class the next morning, it just rained, and she lived 40 mins away in the middle of some really windy backroads. She didnt have a liscence so i had to make the 1.5 hour drive and got back at arround 3am. I was willing to let it go at first but after some thinking i realized just how shitty this was of her and, after a comment she made about me i was not a fan of a few days later,  i told her im done.

My experiences with dating have left me drained and it seems like im doing something wrong or im just repulsive since this keeps happening. Is the happiness of having a partner really worth all this bs to get to that point? Any idea what if anything im doing wrong? Ive considered asking out girls in real life but it seems creepy to me and im not sure if id ever be able to figure out how to, the few times ive tried i think i messed up the timing or something as i felt like a creep due to their reactions.",1,1729780551.0,dating_advice,6,0.67,False

The holiday season, often filled with joy, gatherings, and festivities, can also bring with it a heightened sense of anxiety for many. The pressures of shopping, holiday expectations, and family dynamics, coupled with mental health challenges like Coping with Anxiety, can make this time of year overwhelming. In this blog, we‚Äôll explore how anxiety affects people during the holidays, such as anxiety shopping, anxiety on Christmas, and anxiety about mental illness, and provide practical tips for managing emotional wellbeing.

**Understanding Holiday Anxiety: What Triggers It?**

For many, the holiday season becomes a time of heightened stress rather than relaxation. Anxiety on Christmas is particularly common due to the combination of financial pressure, social obligations, and family expectations. Many people with existing anxiety disorders find their symptoms exacerbated during this time, particularly those who deal with anxiety depression mental health concerns year-round.

**Shopping and Anxiety**

Anxiety shopping is a significant concern during the holiday season. Crowded malls, time constraints, and the pressure to find the perfect gifts can make shopping an overwhelming experience. Some individuals may experience anxiety about [Christmas](https://www.heartfelt-hoodies.com/collections/not-so-ugly-christmas-sweater-hoodie) due to the social pressures of purchasing gifts or being unable to afford the ones they believe are expected. For those dealing and coping with anxiety and depressions, these feelings can be even more pronounced, leading to avoidance behaviors or heightened stress.

Online shopping can ease some of these anxieties, but for some, the convenience of clicking ""buy"" doesn‚Äôt fully erase the underlying concerns. This is where targeted products, like anxiety merchandise, come into play. Items like stress-relief gadgets or even clothing like calming hoodies t can provide physical comfort to ease anxiety and go a long way into coping with anxiety during shopping.

**Mental Health Disorders, Holiday Stress and Coping with Anxiety**

The connection between anxiety and mental health disorders becomes particularly visible during the holiday season. Whether it's anxiety in PTSD, anxiety depression mental health, or anxiety is mental illness, this time of year can amplify struggles.

**Anxiety and Depression During the Holidays**

Anxiety and depression are two of the most common mental health challenges that people face. The relationship between these conditions can make the holiday season even more challenging. Anxiety depression can create a vicious cycle of feeling too overwhelmed to engage in holiday activities while also feeling isolated or disconnected because of not participating.

For those who suffer from mental health anxiety depression, it‚Äôs important to seek support early, before the holiday season becomes overwhelming. Therapy, relaxation techniques, and support from loved ones can be effective ways to manage symptoms.

**Special Considerations: Anxiety in Children and PTSD**

Anxiety in kindergarteners and children is often overlooked during the holidays. Children may feel overwhelmed by the break in routine, travel, or meeting new relatives, leading to separation anxiety or behavioral issues. Understanding their specific needs is crucial for ensuring their emotional wellbeing during the holidays.

Additionally, individuals with anxiety in PTSD may struggle with certain triggers during the holiday season, especially if the holidays remind them of past trauma. Ensuring a safe, supportive environment is essential for those managing PTSD and mental health challenges.

**Coping Strategies to Ease Anxiety**

Managing anxiety on Christmas and the surrounding season requires a mindful approach. Here are some coping strategies that can help ease the burden:

1. Prioritize Emotional Wellbeing

Your emotional wellbeing should always come first. If shopping becomes overwhelming, take breaks, set a budget, and remember that meaningful experiences matter more than material gifts.

2. Create a Health-Conscious Routine

Maintaining a routine during the holiday season can help manage anxiety. Focus on healthy depression habits like exercise, balanced eating, and staying connected with supportive friends and family. Many people experience health anxiety depression, which can be exacerbated by unhealthy holiday routines, so sticking to a routine can alleviate some of this stress.

3. Mindfulness and Relaxation

Practicing mindfulness and relaxation techniques, such as [deep breathing](https://www.heartfelt-hoodies.com/products/dear-person-behind-me-hoodie-its-ok-not-to-be-ok-be-kind) or meditation, can help ease the physical and mental symptoms of anxiety. For those struggling with health anxiety and cancer, maintaining mental calmness is especially important to balance physical health with emotional care.

**Hope for Mental Illness: Fostering Positivity During Tough Times**

Although anxiety and mental health struggles can feel particularly intense during the holidays, it‚Äôs important to remember that there is hope for coping with anxiety, Whether it's hope mental health, hope for mental illness, or hope depression, recognizing that these challenges can be managed and overcome is key to maintaining a positive outlook.

Dear Person Behind Me Hoodie, the world needs more kindness. It begins with your actions, your words, and your heart. Change doesn‚Äôt come overnight, but it starts with you! Every act of kindness creates a ripple. Be the first drop in the water.

**Inspirational Clothing and Awareness**

**Weight:** 61kg

**Age:** 22

**Sex assigned at birth:** AFAB

**Geographic region(s) your ancestors are from:** France and Germany

**Medications:** Spasmine (light anti stress made of hawthorns and valerian, was prescribed it two days ago by my doctor ""just in case it's stress to see if it changes anything"")

**Simplified symptoms list:** clenching pain around the heart (behind left breast) that lasts around 20 minutes, shaking, blueish tips of fingers, plus occasional pain in lower left rib that change when I move (is worse when I'm laying on my back or on my right side), feeling generally unwell, low pulse (between 40 and 60 beats a minute) at rest but high pulse (around 120 beats a minute) immediately after standing up, pulsatile tinnitus that comes and goes, numb left arm, painful periods making me throw up, hot flashes, pain on each side of the neck, rarely swollen hands veins when I stand up getting normal when I law down.

**Health background:** I'm diagnosed autistic, I had covid twice (no complications), I apparently had cytomegalovirus as a kid, I was allergic to the med ""Augmentin"" as a baby, I had iron deficiency as a kid. I often had sinusites and headaches as a kid, sinusities dtopped and hadaches slowly calmed down growing up.

**Background of symptoms:** the pulsatile tinnitus and sometimes swollen hands veins have been happening since years so I never paid attention to it until now since it's just occasional, especially the swollen veins that happened noticeably only a few times in my life (including once in the last six months) tho sometimes it happens but in a way less intense way. Tinnitus comes and goes, sometimes I don't hear it for months, and when I do it increases when I stand up or sit down too fast, move my head or lay down in certain ways. The rest started about six months ago. I felt weird one evening and was bothered by the sound of my heartbeat. I went to sleep and was awaken by clenching feelings in my heart, I was shaking and had blueish fingers. It lastest for about 20 minutes and stopped before I arrived to emergencies. After that it didn't happen again for 2-3 months, sometimes I felt weird and had faint pains in my heart and lower left ribs but that's all. Then I had really painful periods (it's usually painful but not that much, this time the pain was in my lower left ribs and it's usually never the case.) A few days after that the heart thing happened again while I was just sitting in the living room drawing, but without shaking or blueish fingers, and instead numbness in my left arm. Then it happened again the next day, still while I was at rest. It went back to ""normal with occasional weird feelings/faint pains"", then I had really painful periods again, but no pain in ribs this time, instead I spent two hours throwing up again and again (I'm usually nauseous during periods but never to the point of actually throwing up). Then it went back to more or less normal, and a few days ago I had tolerable pain in my lower left ribs again, it seemed to change when I was moving, and was worse when I was laying on my back or right side. It stopped. I've been having hot flashes (but no fever) since, increased tinnitus and pain under my jaw on each side of my neck tho I don't know if this specifically is related to previous symptoms or if I just catched a cold or something. My blood pressure is normal everytime I or a doctor takes it. My pulse is slightly low (between 40 and 60 beats a minute) almost everytime I or √† doctor takes it. Searching on my own I came across POTS and suspected it so I took my pulse immediately after standing up two times, and the two times it was around 120 beats a minute‚Äî I don't know if it is POTS, but I think it should be mentioned.

**Tests I had:** I had 4 ECG (including 2 that were made the same days I had clenching feelings), 3 basic emergency blood tests (including 2 that were made the same days I had clenching feelings), 1 lungs X-ray (made the same day I had clenching feelings), 1 ultrasounds exam of the heart made by a cardiologist. I'm gonna have an abdominal ultrasounds exam in a few weeks that my doctor prescribed.

**Family history:** my mom had an adrenal gland issue when she was in her 40, I don't remember the name but it was serious and really rare so it took years for her to be diagnosed (and the doctors took her files for research on the condition). My grandfather died of cancer (brain I think, but I didn't know him well). My other grandfather had varicose veins issues at some point. Other than that, nothing relevant, and I'm not aware of anyone in my family who had heart issues or anything like that.

**Other informations:** I had depression about seven years ago and I've been mostly bed ridden for a long time because of it, since then I don't exercise much tho I'm slowly trying to go back to it. I don't follow any specific diet. I've had a bad sleep schedule since I was born. I never smoked, never took any drugs, I drank maybe two sips of alcohol in my entire life, and about the same amount of coffee. I had panic attacks when I was a teenager and it didn't feel the same as this at all. My generalist keeps saying it's either muscles or anxiety, I wish it's the first one, but I know it's not the second one as I've been feeling fine everytime the pains were happening and I've not been really stressed in my life for a long time now.",1,1729780376.0,CrowdDiagnosis,0,1.0,False

I was quite proud of myself.

Tldr: I've broken 5 glasses/mugs in 5 days & I want to make an offering to the gods of drinking vessels to appease them from whatever I did to piss them off.

It started earlier this week when I knocked a wine glass over, it literally just fell sideways onto the table & the stem snapped clean in half. Ok, at least I didn't have a huge mess to clean. Got my first break over & done with. It was bound to happen eventually. 

Then on Monday, I was carrying coffee mugs. Double stacked sitting on a saucer to take them back to the kitchen to be washed. Done it heaps. This time, one shifts slightly & makes one pair fall & shatter. Standing there, still with the saucer in my hand & the other mugs & saucers in my other hand, I had no choice but to just watch as the top one from the other hand fell as well. When that one hit the ground, all the customers actually did the oooooh/groan noise as one. It sounded like something out of a bad comedy scene it was collectively timed so well.

Went into the bathroom once all that was cleaned up & nearly cried.

Then tonight, I'm clearing a table, I knock over a wine glass. It didn't break, but I also didn't have time to grab it before it rolled off the opposite side of the table & land on the chair. It didn't break, though. But still, I had no choice but to just listen as it then rolled off the chair & shatter on the tiles.

1gb3xz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spanish/comments/1gb3xz8/how_i_used_spanish_in_italy/,How I used Spanish in Italy,"It might be a long and somewhat incoherent post.   
I selected the ""success story"" flair for this post, but it's really more like my somewhat funny and stressful experiment of dealing with a language barrier by exploiting the closeness of Romance languages. 

So this summer my family planned to travel to Italy for a family vacation, but it quickly turned out that only I and my mom can go, given that my dad was scheduled to be on duty the whole time and my sis is still too small for this, visiting monuments and artistic sites for five days isn't exactly her idea of fun.   
So we booked a guided tour to Tuscany. Thankfully our guide was really proficient in Italian, so we were fine with dealing with ticket offices and stuff, the interesting part of it came when we went to restaurants, coffee shops and the like. 

I'm gonna talk about the ""passive"" use first because that was way easier. I've toyed a bit with trying to understand Italian texts before, so when we arrived, I expected to be able to understand at least some of the warnings, instructions and stuff like that displayed in the hotel and in other buildings, but I ended up being totally floored by how understandable written Italian actually is. I intend not to brag here, but almost everything was understandable or at the least could be deduced, even on the turist guide information texts around sculptures, paintings and such, so I ended up translating for our friends when our guide wasn't around. And my Spanish level isn't even that high, mind you, so it really was both surprising and a bit shocking at the same time. I even got to read some Dante-texts in Firenze, although they were much harder to understand.   
I am a huge language nerd so it was an absolute mind-gasm to be honest. For the majority it didn't even feel like I was abroad - until someone started speaking to me of course...   


The speaking part has been much more tricky, as expected. Absolutely no offense to Italians, but my experience was that only those spoke English who absolutely had no other choice, and even they tend to have difficulties and a really thick (and funny) accent. I'm not blaming them tho, I sucked at English for more than a decade too, but it obviously did raise some problems. (And I obviously couldn't count on some of the people there speaking my native language either, they don't have many reasons to learn Hungarian.) Thankfully the hotel staff was pretty good with English, except for an older gentleman who only spoke in some heavy local dialect so I was kinda afraid of him. Most of the time our guide dealt with the language problem, but when we got some free time between events, everyone went to restaurants and stuff and had to make themselves understood. I realized the aforementioned problem with English pretty early on, but obviously I can't really speak Italian so I had to come up with something. Most of the time it was really funny (well, in restrospect anyway), although kinda stressful.   
The first one was in a pizzeria, and it was absolutely hilarious because it was totally unplanned, it just happened automatically. We've been handed some menus and after a while the waitress came to ask us what do we want to eat. Again, I'm not trying to shame Italians for their accent, but it was just so funny and also very hardly decipherable during this little conversation. (Mom wasn't exactly of great help here, she only speaks Hungarian and like five words in English.) So I managed to make her understand that mom wants a Quattro Stagioni pizza, and she answered something like ""Un quattro stagioni, bene, e?"" so ""A four seasons pizza, okay, and?"". I can understand why she switched back to Italian since she really did struggle with English, but for some reason hearing a Romance language spoken right in front of my face switched something in my head and without realizing it I just answered in Spanish that I would like a Capriciosa pizza. For the rest of our stay there I spoke in Spanish and she spoke in slow Italian and basically everything went fine.   
Later the same day we went to a little coffee shop to drink something. Learning from the previous example I tried to order in Spanish but it turned out to be a mistake. The waitress there basically spoke no English apart from a few words so there was no chance of me using English there. But when I started speaking in Spanish she must've thought I'm really proficient at it or something and started answering in extremely high speed Italian. Needless to say I didn't understand anything, so I just said ""Lo siento, no lo entiendo"", but it made matters even worse because she started speaking a weird mix of Italian and some very strange English, also with extreme speeds. Eventually we ended up getting our drinks but it really wrecked my brain. I guess I should have just stuck to English there, despite the difficulties.   
The other two occasions were less difficult. The last day I asked for two tickets to the funicolare in Spanish with success (thankfully), and later on in a gelateria in Lucca I aksed for a scoop of pistachio but ended up getting stracciatella instead for some reason. 

So yeah, all in all I'd say it was a 3/4 success and gave me some great memories.

Produced in Anxi County, located in Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, this tea holds a special place in the hearts of tea enthusiasts. Known as the ""King of Tea,"" Anxi Tieguanyin is celebrated for its rich aroma, smooth taste, and distinct character, which blends the freshness of green tea with the depth of black tea. With origins tracing back to the Yongzheng period of the Qing Dynasty (1725-1735), this tea has become a symbol of China's tea-making artistry.

# The Origins of Anxi Tieguanyin

The history of Anxi Tieguanyin Tea is rooted in the tea-rich region of Anxi County, a mountainous area in southeastern Fujian Province. According to legend, the name ""Tieguanyin"" (ÈêµËßÄÈü≥), meaning ""Iron Goddess of Mercy,"" comes from a local tale involving a poor farmer who discovered a tea plant in front of a temple dedicated to Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy. The farmer cared for the plant, and in return, it yielded exceptional tea leaves. He named the tea after the goddess in gratitude.

The tea‚Äôs production dates back to the Yongzheng era of the Qing Dynasty, making it nearly 300 years old. Its reputation as a high-quality oolong tea quickly spread throughout China, and today, it remains one of the most prestigious teas in the world. Anxi Tieguanyin Tea is not only a beverage but also a representation of Chinese culture and history.

[Anxi tie guan yin is the greatest tea of oolong tea. It is among the top ten teas of China and world. It is protected by geographical indication and origin.

# The Unique Climate and Growing Conditions

Anxi County is ideal for tea cultivation, thanks to its mountainous terrain, warm climate, and abundant rainfall. The combination of these natural factors creates a perfect environment for tea plants to thrive. The high elevation and misty weather in the mountains of Anxi allow the tea leaves to absorb moisture from the air and nutrients from the soil, resulting in the unique flavor and aroma of Anxi Tieguanyin.

The tea plants in Anxi grow densely, and the region is known for having a wide variety of tea trees. The natural conditions of Anxi, combined with centuries of traditional tea-making techniques, give Tieguanyin its distinct qualities that set it apart from other oolong teas. The plants produce leaves with vibrant, colorful tones that reflect the region's rich biodiversity.

# The Tea Production Process

The production of Anxi Tieguanyin Tea is a highly intricate process that requires great skill and expertise. It is a semi-fermented oolong tea, meaning that its production falls between the methods used for green tea and black tea. The degree of oxidation in Anxi Tieguanyin is carefully controlled, typically around 10-30%, to achieve its signature characteristics.

The process begins with hand-picking the freshest tea leaves during specific harvest seasons. Anxi Tieguanyin Tea can be harvested up to four times a year, with the best quality leaves coming from the spring harvest. The other harvests occur in summer, late summer, and autumn, each producing tea with slightly different flavor profiles. Spring tea is particularly prized for its delicate and refined taste.

Once harvested, the leaves undergo withering, rolling, and fermenting, followed by drying and roasting. The rolling process is crucial to shaping the leaves into their characteristic curled, tight form. The final product is a tea that exhibits a floral fragrance, a slightly fruity sweetness, and a smooth, buttery mouthfeel.

# The Distinct Characteristics of Anxi Tieguanyin Tea

Anxi Tieguanyin Tea is revered for its complex flavor and aroma. It has a rich, floral fragrance reminiscent of orchids, with a smooth, slightly sweet taste that lingers on the palate. The tea‚Äôs color, after brewing, is a bright, golden-green, which reflects its semi-fermented nature. One of the most notable aspects of Anxi Tieguanyin is its ability to maintain a balance between freshness and depth, offering a tea-drinking experience that is both refreshing and satisfying.

The best quality Tieguanyin tea leaves are tightly curled into small, dense shapes, and upon brewing, they unfurl into full, vibrant leaves. This tea has multiple layers of flavor that reveal themselves with each successive brew, making it a favorite for those who enjoy a more complex and nuanced tea experience.

# The Health Benefits of Anxi Tieguanyin Tea

In addition to its exquisite taste, Anxi Tieguanyin Tea is also valued for its numerous health benefits. Like other oolong teas, Tieguanyin is rich in antioxidants, particularly polyphenols, which help reduce the risk of chronic diseases by neutralizing harmful free radicals in the body. These antioxidants are known to improve heart health, support digestion, and promote weight loss by boosting metabolism.

The moderate caffeine content in Tieguanyin tea provides a gentle energy boost without the jittery effects of stronger teas or coffee. Additionally, the tea has calming properties that help reduce stress and promote relaxation, making it a perfect choice for unwinding after a long day.

Some studies have also suggested that oolong teas like Tieguanyin can aid in improving mental alertness and concentration, as well as enhancing skin health by providing essential nutrients that protect against aging.

# Cultural Significance of Anxi Tieguanyin

Anxi Tieguanyin Tea holds a special place in Chinese tea culture. It is often regarded as the embodiment of traditional Chinese values, particularly those of patience, precision, and harmony. The art of making Tieguanyin tea requires careful attention to detail, from the cultivation of the plants to the brewing process, which reflects the Chinese philosophy of achieving balance in all aspects of life.

Tieguanyin tea is also a symbol of hospitality and respect in Chinese society. It is often served to guests as a sign of welcome, and sharing a pot of Tieguanyin tea is considered an intimate and meaningful experience. The ritual of brewing and drinking tea is deeply ingrained in Chinese culture, and Anxi Tieguanyin plays a central role in this tradition.

Anxi Tieguanyin Tea (ÂÆâÊ∫™ÈêµËßÄÈü≥) is more than just a beverage; it is a living testament to the rich cultural heritage of China and the art of tea-making. With its origins in the Qing Dynasty, its unique growing conditions in Anxi County, and its meticulous production process, Tieguanyin continues to be celebrated as one of the finest oolong teas in the world. Its delicate, floral aroma, complex flavors, and numerous health benefits make it a favorite among tea connoisseurs and casual drinkers alike.

Whether enjoyed for its taste, its health properties, or its cultural significance, Anxi Tieguanyin remains a beloved symbol of Chinese tea culture, bringing together centuries of tradition in each cup.

Hey fellow wanderlusters! üòÑ Derek here, also known as u/solopassions, your friendly neighborhood solo travel junkie. If you‚Äôre contemplating a solo trip, you're in for a transformative experience that can change your life in unexpected ways!

First off, let me tell you about cozying up solo in a cabin nestled in the heart of Boulder's majestic Rockies. Imagine waking up to the gentle melody of a bubbling stream and stepping outside to a panoramic masterpiece of jagged, snow-capped peaks gloriously greeting you while you're trying to remember where you put your coffee mug. It's a reality check that's magical, to say the least.

Unique Experiences? Oh, you betcha. Let's talk about the time I single-handedly fended off a raccoon trying to make a meal of my morning toast (spoiler: I lost). Or the instant karma from laughing at a sign warning of ""aggressive chipmunks""... before one chased me down a trail. Nature - 2, Derek - 0.

But beyond the wild shenanigans, traveling solo strips away all the noise, leaving you alone with your thoughts‚Äîand perhaps for the first time, genuinely listening. Solo trips are like a refiner‚Äôs fire for your soul.

Perspective Shift? Travel has a funny way of turning *that voice* in your head into a supportive coach rather than a pesky heckler. I learned to rely on myself entirely, navigating both the literal trails and the metaphorical ones in life. There's a liberating joy in conquering the day all by yourself and then toasting marshmallows under the stars because‚Äîhell yeah‚Äîyou did it!

Advice for Aspiring Solos? Start small. Maybe you don‚Äôt jump straight into two weeks in the wilderness (unless you‚Äôre Bear Grylls), but plan a weekend trip to a nearby town you‚Äôve never explored. Trust me, even if you somehow manage to get lost on every trail, you'll find pieces of yourself you didn‚Äôt know were missing. Oh, and take snacks‚Äîlots of snacks.

Are nerves holding you back? Remember, confidence isn‚Äôt knowing nothing bad ever happens; it‚Äôs knowing you can handle it when it does. And who knows? You might meet some incredible friends along the way. Just make sure it‚Äôs not the raccoons.

So, what‚Äôs stopping you? Get out there‚Äîadventure awaits, and it won't wait forever. Cheers to solo travels and the ridiculous, fantastic tales they bring! ü•Ç

P.S. If any of you have daring raccoon stories, do share them. Misery loves company, and so does comedy. üòÖ

1gb3tr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CureAnxiety/comments/1gb3tr3/foods_you_should_avoid_if_you_have_anxiety_or/,Foods you should avoid if you have anxiety or depression,"Paying attention to your diet can be an important part of your overall well-being when managing anxiety or depression. Certain foods can contribute or exacerbate symptoms of anxiety and depression. To support mental health, it's crucial to limit or avoid foods and beverages that can negatively impact mood and energy levels.

According to the pathological analysis of depression and anxiety, we should avoid various factors that trigger and aggravate the condition.

Therefore, in terms of diet, our diet should avoid:

* **Nerve irritation, excessive excitement**
* **Inflammation in the body and produce toxins**
* **Neurotoxicity damage**

Here are some foods to consider limiting or avoiding if you face anxiety or depression:

# 1, Foods that irritate nerves

**Foods with caffeine**

Consuming caffeine may cause nervousness, irritability, insomnia and headaches. Due to nervous system dysfunction, people suffering from anxiety or depression are more sensitive to caffeine and may aggravate symptoms. Furthermore, individuals with depression and anxiety disorders should avoid caffeine because its consumption leads to a reduction in the synthesis of central serotonin. [\[1-a\] ](https://doi.org/10.12965%2Fjer.1938236.118)[\[1-b\]](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0304-3940(01)01980-2)While serotonin regulates your mood and your sleep cycle, Is better to stop consuming foods that contain [caffeine.\[1\]](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/food-safety/food-additives/caffeine-foods.html)especially when you have panic attack or severe depression,

Coffee

Tea (black/green)

Cola/energy drink

Chocolate (cocoa)

Green tea contains a type of poly-phenol called a catechin, Cocoa also contains polyphenols. Both of them are very good antioxidants that help prevent cell damage and benefit our brain and nerves recovering. The only side effect is they contain caffeine. Therefore, for those who are sensitive to caffeine have to replace with other antioxidants supplements. But if your case is not severe or acute, we suggest to limit the amount until you are completely well.

**Herbs that stimulate the nerves**

Some people may try to use herbs, natural remedy to treat anxiety and depression. However we need to notice that some herbal may contain ingredients that irritate nerves. We should avoid using those remedies to prevent the situation from deteriorating.

Here is the list of herbs that may stimulate the nerves:\[2\]

Ginseng\[3\]

Licorice

Angelica sinensis

Dried ginger

Ephedra

Cinnamon

# 2ÔºåFoods that cause inflammation

# 

Numerous research studies\[4\]\[5\] have indicated a higher likelihood of major depression or anxiety in individuals who adhere to a Western diet dominated by heavily processed foods. The foods that these participants were eating are ""Western"" diet consisting of processed or fried foods, refined grains, sugary products, and beer. Consuming these food items can induce inflammation within the body, exacerbating the symptoms of depression and anxiety.

**Sugar**

In a systematic review conducted in 2018,\[6\] it was revealed that numerous studies had established a connection between increased dietary sugar intake, particularly from sugary beverages, and the presence of chronic inflammation. Those who consumed higher levels of sugar in their diets exhibited elevated levels of inflammatory markers in their bloodstream, notably a marker known as C-reactive protein.

Sugar elevates insulin levels, promoting the storage of fat in the abdominal region. This visceral fat, commonly referred to as belly fat, is responsible for generating inflammatory compounds within the body.

**Trans fats**

Trans fats inhibit the receptors for beneficial anti-inflammatory fats. Despite the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's regulations prohibiting trans fats in food products, trans fats may still be found in many shelf-stable items such as crackers, cereals, and cookies. Additionally, fried foods and dairy products can also contain trans fats.

Research\[7\] found out that trans fats may¬†increase inflammatory markers¬†and the risk of chronic inflammation.

**Processed foods**

P[rocessed ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5540319/)foods, such as hot dogs and lunch meats, contain inflammatory chemicals used in preservation.

**Refined grains**

Refined grains lead to an elevation in C-reactive protein, which is a liver protein indicating inflammation in the body. Furthermore, refined grains are rapidly digested, resulting in spikes in insulin levels and the promotion of fat storage.Refined grain include products such as: white bread, white rice, crackers, white pasta.

Residents who are accustomed to rice and bread as their primary dietary staples can consider substituting with whole wheat bread, potatoes, sweet potatoes,oats, peas and similar alternatives.

**Additives**

Food additives such as monosodium glutamate (MSG), aspartame, and excessive salt are commonly included in packaged foods for preservation and enhanced flavor. However, these chemicals have been associated with heightened inflammation, which can exacerbate arthritis symptoms. To mitigate these effects, it's advisable to steer clear of processed foods, diet sodas, and other convenience products in your diet.

# 3, Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs

**Alcohol** causes changes in the brain that lead to the depletion of chemicals that naturally help reduce anxiety. In the long term, it can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as an increase in overall alcohol consumption.

Some people **smoke** to relieve stress and perform ""self-medication."" However, research shows that smoking can actually increase anxiety and tension. Smoking causes the brain to shut down its dopamine-producing mechanisms, so dopamine is reduced in the long run.

**Drugs** interfere with chemicals in the brain and may affect the brain's messaging and function, causing changes in brain structure and function that may increase the risk of certain mental health conditions.

I‚Äôm a senior in high school now, and I met her in middle school. She was, quite literally, my everything. I genuinely loved her, and I really thought we‚Äôd be friends forever. Our friendship wasn‚Äôt typical‚Äîit was different. We were incredibly close, did everything together, and never fought. There was never a dull moment between us.**

**She had a tough home life, so I did my best to include her in everything. I took her to family dinners, birthdays, and switched my schedule around just to have classes with her. I even skipped classes that I didn‚Äôt have with her, just to hang out. When she had panic attacks, I helped her through them. When she had concerns about her body or eating habits, I gave her advice on taking care of herself. (For context, She‚Äôd often compare herself to me because I played sports, exercised five days a week, and ate well. It was a big part of our friendship‚ÄîI‚Äôd have to uplift her almost daily, which I understood, everyone has insecurities.) I also had a little more money than her‚Äînot a crazy amount, but my mom and I could afford to go shopping or get our nails done on weekends. Most of my closet consists of expensive brands. Her mother, on the other hand, would*****never***¬†**go out and practically refused to buy her new clothes, even though she‚Äôd been wearing the same clothes from elementary to high school. She‚Äôd use her own savings to buy from places like Temu or Shein but still felt bad because she couldn‚Äôt have the kind of clothes I had.**

**Whenever she came over (which was almost every weekend, every break, and sometimes for weeks in the summer), I‚Äôd cook for her and try to make it an enjoyable experience. My mom and I aren‚Äôt rich by any means‚Äîmy mom works two jobs as a single parent to support us. But she‚Äôs generous. Whenever we went out, my friend never paid for a thing. We went to the beach every week during the summer, out to eat, shopping‚Äîyou name it‚Äîand she didn‚Äôt pay a dime.**

**This summer, I got my first job and my driver‚Äôs license. I was looking to buy a car, so I often called my friend to talk about my options. She expressed jealousy, especially about the car, telling me how lucky I was. I tried to explain that I had my own problems. I just didn‚Äôt share them with her. I guess she saw my life as perfect and assumed I never struggled. When I got my job, that was another big issue. For months, she complained that we didn‚Äôt hang out anymore because I worked weekends, and she could only see me at school. I rearranged my schedule to have almost all my classes and lunch with her, but she still complained. I talk to my mom about it and she generously offered to let her work with me at my job so we could ride together. I helped her apply, prepared her for her interview, and she got it. I**¬†***gave***¬†**her a job, essentially. But after a couple of days working together, things fell apart. One day, we were rushing to get ready, and I told her we needed to hurry, and she started stressing out, eventually telling us to leave without her. She left without saying goodbye, texting me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù My mom was mad, justifiably, at how disrespectful it was. At work, she was distant, and when I asked if she was mad at me, she said she wasn‚Äôt‚Äîjust disappointed that I stood my ground and told her that she and my mom deserved an apology. She texted me a rant about how she never felt appreciated in our friendship and always put in more effort than I did. She said she felt we should distance ourselves. I cried, apologized, but told her I‚Äôd stay away if that‚Äôs what she wanted. No response. Over time, I realized that what my friend did was toxic, I‚Äôm better off without her. But I still miss her. I miss laughing with her and having someone to connect with. The truth is, I abandoned all my other friends for her‚ÄîI even switched schools to be with her. Now, I‚Äôm lonely.**

**My mom has always been my best friend, and I love that I‚Äôve grown closer to her since I don‚Äôt have many other people to talk to. I have two good friends at work who I stay close to. They may not be forever friends, but they‚Äôre nice, and I laugh with them. I don‚Äôt have anyone at school to talk to, but that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôve always been an extreme introvert, so I‚Äôm comfortable being alone. I love my quiet time‚Äîgetting coffee, listening to my favorite music, and reading. I‚Äôm not as busy with her anymore, worrying about whether she thinks I‚Äôm mad if I‚Äôm quiet.**

**At school and work, I don‚Äôt speak to her, but I‚Äôve noticed she‚Äôs different. There was one day at work, we talked the whole day, and I realized she‚Äôs not the same person I once knew. She‚Äôs friendlier, laughs louder, and hangs out with people we used to talk shit about. She‚Äôs become close with girls she used to tell me she hated. It‚Äôs like everyone is suddenly her friend.**

**I‚Äôm about to graduate, and once I move on from my job, I‚Äôll never have to see her again. I‚Äôll be in college and meet new friends. I can‚Äôt help but think about the plans we had‚Äîmoving into an apartment together, going out, and doing all the things we dreamed of‚Äîbut it‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm ok. I‚Äôm not depressed or anything like that. I still go out with my mom and live my life. I like my quiet life, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it. Of course, I miss her. I want to talk to her like we used to, but I can‚Äôt because she‚Äôs not the same, and I honestly don‚Äôt like her anymore. In fact, I hate her. But it still sucks.**

1st and 2nd picture are current 3rd pic is older and is for general idea for the size of the small living room.

4th pic are tables that we like, and like the idea of a concrete table, too. Honestly, we‚Äôre both not crazy over a glass top but are open to the idea.

From my husbands research, he thinks the table should be around  H 18 X W 24 X D 16. 

Any additional living room ideas would be great! We‚Äôre planning to hang a lot of art on the wall behind the tv, hang some curtains, etc. i would like black and white/cream pattern somewhere at some point too‚Ä¶ maybe just a blanket or curtains idk.
