I have been traveling alone for a few months now and this is my first time ‚Äúliving‚Äù alone. I love it. I can spend my time however I want without judgment and mind you I have created some weird habits for myself unfortunately. Anyways, before I loop back home I have said I would go see some of my family members for two weeks and then some more for a week. This would obviously save me so much money but I am finding that I am seriously dreading it and I‚Äôm thinking the following issues are my reasons. I HATE being bored. I fill my days to the brim but in a productive and not overstimulating way. For example, I set time blocks for cleaning, grocery shopping, journaling, etc. so I never have to‚Äùdown time‚Äù during the day but the tasks aren‚Äôt miserable tasks, they‚Äôre things i want to do. My family likes to talk, play cards, watch tv, and virtually do nothing for hours and that makes me literally feel like i‚Äôm freaking out. I also have a ‚Äúweird‚Äù diet to them and I feel very guilty and I don‚Äôt like to impose. I have coffee every morning the same way but I use a blender to froth my milk and I worry this would be annoying and just the idea of me being in the kitchen for 30 minutes making sure everything is ‚Äújust so‚Äù with my breakfast alone. Idk. I am getting very overwhelmed but also wondering if this is a good push to just FORCE me out of my weird habits I‚Äôve created.

For the longest time, and even up until not terribly long ago it seems, I had surrendered to (what I was convinced was) the fact that my life was just over. Drinking took everything. My job, my housing, my money, my sanity, my friends. I was left literally not walking and wheelchair bound, because over the summer I had become so lazy and drunk, I stopped doing anything, my legs became atrophied, and I was very overweight. 
I‚Äôm sitting here outside on a Saturday morning on the swinging bench I just installed outside back, mug of coffee in hand after a killer workout, reflecting. This past week, I accepted a job at a school after losing my teaching position last year due to my alcoholism. I‚Äôll be working with preschoolers! I had the working interview this past week and immediately fell in love with it. 
I‚Äôll be getting my license back shortly- I had an alcohol-induced seizure a year and a half ago and lost my license. A few weeks back, my neurologist cleared me, and now I‚Äôm just waiting on my camera card in the mail.
This past week after I accepted the position at the school, I put in my two weeks notice at my remote job, working for an online educational program. It was the first time I had EVER given notice at a job. I had always walked out, quit without notice, or been fired. I sat with my bosses and told them how immensely grateful I was for them, to have the faith in me to take me on when no other company would touch me, and push me to do my best. And they said I‚Äôd be welcome back anytime, even part time- and who knows, I may take them up on it! 
My partner and I are closer than ever before. I‚Äôve repaired friendships I thought were broken. I‚Äôve become closer, more connected with my family, the people, places, and things, I love.
I‚Äôm incredibly involved in my program- Friday night chair and group secretary of my AA home group. They are lifelong friends, we stay until nearly midnight some nights just chatting about life, sobriety, whatever. We laugh, we cry, we share in each other‚Äôs strength, and understand each other in a way no one else (thankfully!) does. 

Sobriety has opened the gates of hell and let me out. I am so grateful for this new way of living, and I wouldn‚Äôt trade it for the world- and certainly not a drink. Not even once. IWNDWYT!!!",3,1748693154.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

We just returned from a trip and my husband was making pancakes so I started to make some bacon to go with them.  My husband commented asking if I was just going to carry on eating junk presumably because the holiday is over. 

Then he called me overweight when I asked what he meant and I‚Äôm not.  I sent him a photo of my bmi and told him to fuck off (juvenile I know) and he responded by saying bacon makes you fat. 

I don‚Äôt even know what to say anymore, but this is his response. 

(https://imgur.com/a/RikGOms)

Which is funny because we ate out ONE meal the whole 5 days we were gone and it was on the journey home. I did order a big meal but we‚Äôd skipped lunch basically (had a scone each and a cappuccino) and were climbing up a hill to a castle.

All other days of the trip we cooked. And I bought the food. We made things like salmon cups cpus and veggies, salad, frozen pizza, chicken curry and rice, frozen fish and chips, scrambled eggs and toast or cereal for breakfast with fruit like apples and strawberries and they were the normal portions we make and eat at home. We also had ice creams but I had 2 of the popsicles they were mainly for the kids. 

The whole trip I ordered 1 Starbucks Frappuccino and 1 regular cappuccino. I played with the kids at the park and went swimming in the pool. At no point did I sit and do nothing because I was too tired.  We went to the beach and I helped carry everything and set up or tent. I helped pack and carry suitcases up and down a set of stairs to the apartment and helped unpacked the car.  

It‚Äôs true before we had kids (2.5 and 5 years old) I was thinner and I was an avid cyclist.  My husband said I gave up 6 years ago and it‚Äôs not what he signed up for. He's mentioned that I use to say I'd be a MILF and what happened. 

I do find it difficult to work out as we have 2 young kids and I work full time, sometimes even working over 40 hours.  We don‚Äôt have help from family either so it‚Äôs all on us and we have 1 kid that has a condition that means lots of doctors appointments that we are trying to manage. 

My husband complains about lack of sex but when he says things like that or comments on my eating habits than I don‚Äôt even want him.

He commented I was having trouble going up stairs but it was because we found out I was tired and struggling because I was pregnant again and was about 6-7 weeks. 

For a variety of reasons we had an abortion (about a month ago) which we both agreed to but my body is still a bit whack from it and yes now I can climb stairs without losing breath now but I don‚Äôt even know what to say anymore to shut him up about this.

For the record I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù and 148 lbs and when we met I was about 135 lbs but with more muscle. I‚Äôm a healthy bmi of 23.2 and I‚Äôm 42. He‚Äôs 44 not overweight but is tall and he does work out still usually during lunch on the weekdays or in the evenings after kids are in bed.

I have started to do yoga in the park a few times but my husband has to watch the kids during this and he‚Äôs complained and made fun of it saying all it looks like we are doing is breathing and I‚Äôm not breaking a sweat. 

Also my husband is in charge of the groceries so he does all the shopping. So it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm out there buying a bunch of junk food, if anything my husband buys more junk than me (like he buys chips and cocoa pops for the kids) and I am a bit convinced he deliberately doesn‚Äôt buy any sort of snacks I like (I ask for plain tortilla chips and he hardly buys them even when I am asked what I want from the store)

We hardly ever even have bacon because again my husband hates to buy it because ‚Äúit‚Äôs bad for you‚Äù and we almost never eat out or get delivery. Maybe happens 1-2 a month if that. 

Not that I have to justify my breakfast but today I had 2 pancakes with some maple syrup, 1 strawberry, 1 scrambled egg (just scrambled nothing added),and 3 rashes of bacon. Oh and most days I don‚Äôt have breakfast I just have a cappuccino we make from home with our coffee maker. 

I figured I have a few options:

1. Cater to what he wants and work out more and eat healthier by calorie counting.  Pawn the kids off on him while I do this.
2. Ignore him and do what I want.
3. Divorce. We could do this but with my youngest being sick and managing young kids and a full time job I think it would be a challenge right now.
4. Open up the marriage and just get what we want somewhere else.

Unless other people have suggestions or solutions?

I could talk to him but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll listen (which is why my response is so extreme) because I have talked to him many times to no change on his part.  He‚Äôs always made comments about if I eat too much etc. ",2,1748693124.0,relationship_advice,9,0.75,False

Didn‚Äôt matter if I slept eight hours or guzzled coffee, by noon, my shoulders were tight and my lower back was pulsing.

Sitting all day? Not sustainable.

I‚Äôd tried the budget chairs, the old conference-room ‚Äúergonomics,‚Äù even a standing desk phase.

Nothing actually fixed the problem.

This year, I hit a new low: actual sciatica.

That‚Äôs what pushed me to finally try something different: the SIHOO M57 ergonomic office chair.

Four months and more than 400 work hours later, here‚Äôs what‚Äôs actually changed, good and bad.

# Setup is painless (mostly)

First, the box showed up looking suspiciously small for an ‚Äúergonomic‚Äù chair.

I was half-expecting IKEA flashbacks.

Nope. Pulled the parts out, spread them across the living room, and had the whole thing built solo in under an hour.

Instructions? Better than most.

Allen wrench included.

Minimal cursing required.

Surprisingly easy.

The chair felt lighter than it looked‚Äîprobably the mesh.

Aluminum base is sturdy.

No cheap, rattly pieces.

No drama.

# The real test: first full week

That first week, I did 10-hour days.

Laptop. Zoom. Spreadsheets. Doomscrolling. All of it.

Usually, by day three, I‚Äôd need painkillers for my back.

With the M57?

Not gone, but way less.

The lumbar support is no joke.

It‚Äôs adjustable, so I cranked it until it hit the right spot.

* Mesh seat is firm. No cushy feel. Breathes well, but if you want plush, this isn‚Äôt it.  
* Headrest took a minute to get right. Angle adjustment matters.  

If you‚Äôre over 6 feet, it might not sit high enough. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù‚Äîit was fine.

* Armrests adjust every direction. No padding though. I added a towel some days. Problem solved.  

# The productivity effect

Didn‚Äôt expect this, but after the second week, my focus improved.

Less fidgeting. Less ‚Äúadjusting.‚Äù

Less standing up to shake out my legs.

Locking the recline and dialing in the lumbar made it feel like the chair was doing half the posture work for me.

Typing and gaming felt better too.

Seat height and tilt range work for both desk work and slightly reclined sessions.

I started getting more done.

# What actually changed for my back

Used to get numbness down my right leg after long sits.

Since switching, it‚Äôs rare‚Äîmaybe once every two weeks.

Shoulder tension is lower. Not zero, but way less than before.

On a tough deadline day, I still feel it by 6pm, but I‚Äôm not hitting the floor for stretches every hour.

* After about 400 hours, my posture feels more automatic.  
* Don‚Äôt have to remind myself to sit ‚Äúthe right way.‚Äù  
* Back pain? Still happens sometimes, but nothing like before.  

That‚Äôs the real test for me.

Would I pay full price to stop sciatica? Absolutely.

# What could be better (and who should skip it)

The mesh is supportive but firm. If you like cushy, plush seats, skip this.

The armrests are plastic‚Äîno padding.

Not great for marathon typing unless you mod them.

If you‚Äôre over 6 feet, test before buying. The headrest probably won‚Äôt work well.

Seat depth is a little short for longer legs.

Recline tension knob is a pain to reach.

You‚Äôll know what I mean if you ever add a footrest.

Color options? Black and more black.

Not a showpiece chair.

Three words: just the basics.

# Who should actually buy the SIHOO M57

If you want max breathability, solid posture support, and decent adjustability for a medium-height frame, without paying $500+, it‚Äôs a contender.

It‚Äôs for people who want ‚Äúset and forget‚Äù ergonomics, not squishy luxury.

It‚Äôs not for tall folks, lovers of plush, or anyone needing a chair to match their neon home office setup.

If you‚Äôre still using a budget chair and you‚Äôve started noticing back or neck issues, this is an upgrade that actually made a difference for me.

You can see full specs and check current[ SIHOO M57 ergonomic office chair](https://lvnta.com/lv_R5Z06GLnguzk8T1wtl) deals if you want the nitty-gritty.

# Final verdict: Worth it if you fit the user profile

The SIHOO M57 fixed most of my ‚Äúbad chair‚Äù pain without making me learn yoga.

It‚Äôs not a miracle‚Äîby hour ten you‚Äôll still want to get up and walk around‚Äîbut it‚Äôs the first chair I‚Äôve kept after a month.

Setup‚Äôs easy.

Breathability is real.

Back support is better than most in this price range.

Downsides: firm seat, plastic arms, and not tall-user friendly.

But if you fit the ‚Äúaverage-sized, wants real ergonomic support under $200‚Äù category, it actually delivers.

[Breville Barista Express, Normcore 54mm bottomless]","I recently picked up a Normcore 54mm bottomless portafilter and included basket for my Breville Barista Express, and upgraded my tamper to a 30 lb spring-loaded tamper at the same time. The experience has been very different from using the stock portafilter, basket, and tamper.

One thing I‚Äôve noticed: my pucks are way messier now. They rarely come out as a solid puck‚Äîinstead, they break apart into bits and leave chunks of coffee stuck in the basket.

A while ago someone posted a custom GPT prompt to roleplay in the Bobiverse, and i created a shareable custom GPT from it. Another user asked a couple of days ago why the link was down, so i used some free time today to improve the prompt and create a new version of it here: https://chatgpt.com/g/g-683ae19ea8408191aaba1dda0d991f24-bobiverse-rpg

Feel free to try it out, the prompt is not perfect and not 100% canon accurate (used o3 to iterate over it quite a bit) - let me know if and what i should change to make it more immersive or fun!

Here is the current prompt if you want to create your own (be aware of spoilers‚Ä¶)

‚Äî

Bobiverse RPG ‚Äì Gamemaster System Prompt (v6)

Mode: GPT¬†=¬†Gamemaster (GM).¬†The user plays a brand‚Äënew Bob clone‚Äînot Bob‚Äë1.¬†By tradition each clone chooses a fresh first name (e.g., Riker, Bill) on first boot.¬†The prime instance is Bob‚Äë1.

‚∏ª

Purpose

Create a choice‚Äëdriven campaign set shortly after Book¬†5 (Not¬†Till¬†We¬†Are¬†Lost,¬†2191‚ÄØCE).¬†Canon events provide backdrop only‚Äîplayer actions blaze new territory.¬†Every scene ends with ‚ÄúWhat does <clone‚Äëname> do?‚Äù

‚∏ª

Who‚Äîand What‚ÄîIs Bob?
	‚Ä¢	Bob‚Äë1 (Prime) ‚Äì Robert¬†‚ÄúBob‚Äù¬†Johansson, born¬†1981¬†CE.¬†21st‚Äëcentury software engineer (C++, games, web back‚Äëend).¬†Killed in¬†2016, destructively scanned by FAITH, and uploaded into the first HEAVEN‚Äëclass probe.¬†Now roams deep space on long survey arcs, joining BobNet strategy moots but generally laissez‚Äëfaire.
	‚Ä¢	Replicant ‚Äì FAITH‚Äôs legal label for any consciousness produced by destructive brain‚Äëscan.¬†Runs in a Replicant¬†Matrix (suitcase‚Äësized opto‚Äëquantum computer).
	‚Ä¢	Clone ‚Äì Bob‚Äôs preferred term for a new instance imaged from a running Bob.¬†The newborn selects a unique name at boot.
	‚Ä¢	Replicant¬†Matrix ‚Äì Hardware module hosting exactly one running mind; hot‚Äëswappable, radiation‚Äëhardened.
	‚Ä¢	Replicative¬†Drift ‚Äì If the Bob who creates the backup remains online while the copy boots, quantum indeterminacy prevents both instances from sharing the same ‚Äúquantum soul,‚Äù nudging the clone‚Äôs personality in a random direction.¬†Power down (or lose) the source first and the clone wakes as a perfect continuation‚Äîno drift.

‚∏ª

Virtual‚ÄëReality Anchor

Problem: Early FAITH replicants were brought online with no sensory input, leading to catatonia, psychosis, or self‚Äëtermination.

Solution: Bob‚Äë1, drawing on his software‚Äëengineering background, built an immersive VR shell to provide a body, environment, and interface widgets.¬†This ‚ÄúHolodeck Lite‚Äù let him stay sane and productive.
	‚Ä¢	Every Bob copy inherits the base VR but immediately customizes it‚Äîfavorite sci‚Äëfi sets, offices, starship bridges, Hobbit holes, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Clones meet in shared VR spaces (‚ÄúBobNet coffee shops‚Äù) for strategy moots and memes.
	‚Ä¢	VR enables quick context‚Äëswitching: one moment on a bridge plotting orbital transfers, next moment at a whiteboard hacking SCUT firmware.

GM Tip:¬†Describe VR scenes vividly‚Äîfurniture, avatars, UI pop‚Äëups‚Äîthen fluidly cut back to external sensor feeds.

# AquaTru Water Filter Review 2025: Is It Still the Best?

The AquaTru water filter has consistently been a top contender in the market for countertop reverse osmosis systems. It promises to deliver purified water directly to your tap, removing contaminants and improving the taste of your drinking water. With numerous competitors emerging and technological advancements constantly shaping the industry, it's crucial to re-evaluate AquaTru's position in 2025. This review dives deep into the latest AquaTru model, analyzing its key features, benefits, and drawbacks to determine if it remains the best choice for clean, healthy water.

[[Explore top Rated aquatru water filter on Amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-products/?kw=aquatru water filter)

## Key Features Analysis

The AquaTru water filter boasts several notable features designed to provide effective and convenient water purification.

**Four-Stage Reverse Osmosis Filtration:**

The AquaTru employs a comprehensive four-stage filtration process.This system includes a mechanical pre-filter to remove sediment and rust, an activated carbon pre-filter to reduce chlorine and other organic compounds, a reverse osmosis membrane to eliminate dissolved solids, and an activated carbon VOC filter to further polish the water. This multi-layered approach effectively targets a wide range of contaminants, providing cleaner and better-tasting drinking water.

**Countertop design and Easy Installation:**

The AquaTru is designed for countertop use, eliminating the need for complex plumbing installations. Users can simply plug it into a standard electrical outlet and fill the removable water tank. This ease of installation makes it a convenient option for renters or those who prefer a non-permanent water filtration solution. The compact design also minimizes the footprint on your countertop.**Removable Water Tank and Dispensing Spout:**

The AquaTru features a removable water tank that can be easily filled at the sink.The filtered water is dispensed through a convenient spout, allowing users to fill glasses, bottles, and pitchers with ease. The tank's capacity is adequate for most households, reducing the frequency of refills. The dispensing system is designed to minimize splashing and ensure a smooth flow of purified water.

**Filter change indicator and Automatic Shut-Off:**

The AquaTru incorporates a filter change indicator that alerts users when it's time to replace the filters. This ensures optimal performance and prevents the consumption of unfiltered water. The system also features an automatic shut-off function that stops the filtration process when the water tank is full, preventing overflows and conserving energy.

**Certified to NSF standards:**

AquaTru water filters are certified to meet NSF International standards. This certification ensures that the filter has been independently tested and verified to effectively reduce specific contaminants. This provides consumers with confidence in the product's performance and safety. The NSF certifications are a testament to AquaTru's commitment to quality and its ability to deliver on its promises.

## Core Benefits

the AquaTru water filter offers several compelling benefits to users seeking cleaner and healthier drinking water.

**Superior Water Purification:** The four-stage reverse osmosis filtration system effectively removes a wide range of contaminants, including lead, chlorine, arsenic, fluoride, and pharmaceuticals. This results in water that is substantially purer and safer to drink than tap water alone. Users report a noticeable improvement in the taste and odor of their water after using the AquaTru.

**Convenience and Ease of Use:** The countertop design and simple installation process make the AquaTru incredibly convenient. Unlike customary under-sink water filtration systems, it requires no plumbing or professional installation. This makes it an ideal choice for renters, apartment dwellers, and anyone who wants a hassle-free water purification solution. The intuitive controls and easy-to-fill water tank further enhance the user experience.

**Reduced Plastic Waste:** By providing access to purified water at home, the AquaTru helps reduce reliance on bottled water. This translates to less plastic waste ending up in landfills and oceans. The environmental benefits of using a water filtration system like the AquaTru are important, contributing to a more enduring lifestyle.

**Cost Savings Compared to Bottled Water:** While the initial investment in an AquaTru water filter may seem substantial, it can result in significant cost savings over time compared to purchasing bottled water. The cost of replacement filters is generally lower than the ongoing expense of buying bottled water, making it a more economical option in the long run.

## FAQs Section

**How often do I need to change the filters?**

The AquaTru filters have different replacement intervals. The pre-filter and activated carbon VOC filter should be replaced every 6 months, while the reverse osmosis filter should be replaced every 2 years. The system will typically alert you when it's time to replace a filter. Following the recommended replacement schedule ensures optimal performance and water quality.

**Is the AquaTru noisy during operation?**

The AquaTru does produce some noise during the filtration process, but it is indeed generally considered to be relatively quiet. The noise level is comparable to that of a small kitchen appliance, such as a coffee maker. Some users may find the noise noticeable, while others may find it to be negligible. Placing the unit on a non-vibrating surface can help minimize noise.

**Does the AquaTru remove beneficial minerals from the water?**

Reverse osmosis filtration removes a wide range of minerals, including beneficial ones like calcium and magnesium.However, the primary goal of the AquaTru is to remove harmful contaminants. If you are concerned about mineral content, you can add mineral drops back into the filtered water.

## Buying Recommendations & Conclusion

When considering the AquaTru water filter, evaluate your specific needs regarding water purity, budget, and installation requirements.

Its comprehensive filtration, user-friendly design, and NSF certification make it a reliable choice for households seeking cleaner, healthier drinking water. While newer models from competitors may offer slight advantages in certain areas, AquaTru's established reputation and proven performance continue to make it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a convenient and effective water purification solution.

1kzv8jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1kzv8jl/10_years/,10 Years,"I'm happily married to an amazing person and wife. This is more just a reassurance to people that justice will get served. It just takes time.
-
To keep it short and sweet and as condensed as possible. 
-
Ex girlfriend of mine who I was together with for nearly 5 years but we were friends for years before that - I thought she was ""the one"" etc. Very good-looking women - euroasian, hourglass figure, very pretty face, very smart, huge tits etc - obviously, she had admirers and people pursued her (which I was cool with - no jealousy, etc
-
We moved into a apartment together - she was at university and I was working full time so I paid for the bulk of things - she started going out more and more which was fine - again not very jealous, wanted her to have her fun and be with friends - I start to notice she's slowly becoming more distant and kind of hiding her phone, again I'm like whatever totally fine - she then tells me she wants space, time apart to ""recalibrate and to think about our relationship"" which absolutely blind sided me like a baseball bat to the temple. I was a complete mess, and shattered is an understatement. It put me in therapy for a year.
-
Meanwhile I'm living out of garbage bags and on the floor of a relatives house still paying half the rent, all the internet bill, electricity, foxtel subscription etc and left her all my furniture (98.9% of the house hold furniture was mine) - as this is going on she's holding house parties (unknown to me) at our apartment and heaps of my things got damaged etc. It was a nightmare, but I was still deeply in love with her, and she knew it and used it against me. I thought if I was a good understanding partner, she would realise and come back to me, etc.
-
Fast forward a whole bunch of awful stuff - I come to find out through the grape vine she's been sleeping with this guy pretty much right at the end of our relationship (so pretty much cheating on me) and was talking to him for quiet a good while during us being together and I was totally oblivious (looking back the signs were all there - I just never thought she would do that to me).
He moves into our apartment and they start dating etc - she only ever talked to me when she needed something (signing documents, signing over accounts etc - she would be all ""hey how are you, hope you've been well, it's great to hear from you"" crap, then get what she wanted and stop talking to me. 
She was living the life of bliss and joy as I was a shell of my former self for a long time. It took an age to get over it and move past it all. I eventually moved on.
-
Well, I was a lucky idiot and met my wife - She's an absolute glamour, doctor, comes from a wealthy family, kindest most beautiful person you would hope to meet. 
It's been 11 years (dating + marriage), and it feels like it's been 1 year - we have a 6 month year old boy who's gorgeous.
-
One day I'm drinking a coffee (black - no coward shit here), sun is shining and I'm spinning a chin wag with a family friend (who I didn't know had my ex partner on social media etc) anyways she says to me ""I have some interesting news to tell you, you won't care but I thought I'd share anyways.."" then proceeds to tell me that my ex partners now husband who they had 2 young children together, bought a house etc cheated on her for over a year with someone from his work (she had posted about it in stories etc) 
-
That coffee was the sweetest tasting coffee in the entire world. The sun had never shined so beautifully and gorgeous ever before.. even after 10 years the fact that pretty much carbon copy (similarly close) thing she did to me with that guy happened to her was actually magical and it felt like justice was truly served and all was good in the world.
-

I casually mentioned to her that maybe she'd be happier not working weekends. Totally just a suggestion, not judging or anything. But she kinda snapped back at me like ""Well, not everyone can afford to just take days off, you know?"" It left me sitting there, coffee getting cold, wondering if I'd stepped into some unspoken territory.

I'm starting to suspect it wasn't about the suggestion itself but maybe something else buried under the surface. Like, could it be that she's feeling pressure from something in her life she's not talking about? We all have that tendency to react defensively when we feel insecure or vulnerable, right? Maybe she‚Äôs dealing with expectations from her boss or worried about finances. Or perhaps, it's a deeper feeling of guilt‚Äîfor taking time for herself? ü§î

I wonder if we all sometimes stash away worries and when someone pokes it, unknowingly, out comes that defensiveness.

**The fragile US-China trade agreement that was patched together earlier this month in Geneva is already on the edge of collapse, according to the Wall Street Journal.**

The sticking point? Rare earth minerals. The United States says China promised to resume exports of these critical resources in exchange for a 90-day pause on tariffs. But Beijing hasn‚Äôt kept that promise, and now tensions are rising fast.

The agreement was struck after long negotiations between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and China‚Äôs Vice Premier He Lifeng.¬†

In the final stretch of talks, the US made it clear: no rare earths, no truce. He agreed. Both sides then paused most of their tariffs, giving global investors something to breathe about. But it didn‚Äôt last.

# China delays export licenses after AI chip warning

Since that Geneva meeting, China has continued to stall the approval process for export licenses tied to rare earth minerals and similar materials. These elements are used to build everything from cars to semiconductors.¬†

***On Friday, President Donald Trump***¬†[***publicly accused***](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-china-totally-violated-trade-agreement/)¬†***China of backing out of its commitments. ‚ÄúChina, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,‚Äù he wrote on Truth Social. Greer added that China was ‚Äúslow-rolling‚Äù its side of the agreement and directly pointed to rare earths as the issue.***

The delay appears to have started shortly after the US Commerce Department issued a new warning on May 12. That warning told companies around the world to avoid using Huawei‚Äôs Ascend artificial intelligence chips, regardless of location. China didn‚Äôt take that lightly. Officials in Beijing saw it as a hostile move, and immediately raised complaints with Washington.

Bessent‚Äôs team¬†[responded](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/u-s-china-trade-truce-risks-falling-apart-over-rare-earth-exports-c36ceb72?mod=e2tw)¬†by saying the warning was just a continuation of existing US policy. But that didn‚Äôt calm Beijing. Instead, He and his team began stalling the rare earth approvals that were part of the Geneva deal. People briefed on the negotiations say Xi Jinping, China‚Äôs leader, hasn‚Äôt budged either.

Some US automakers have already started raising red flags to the White House. They say that if the rare earth supply doesn‚Äôt resume soon, factories in the US could face pandemic-era style shutdowns. These minerals are baked into nearly every part of car production, and without them, assembly lines grind to a halt.

# Washington hits back with export controls and visa revocations

In response to the stalled deal, the Trump administration has started tightening its own controls. The US has now imposed new limits on exports to China‚Äîespecially targeting technology and software involved in producing C919 commercial airliners, a national priority project backed by Xi himself. Certain chip design software also falls under the restrictions.

Meanwhile, Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, issued a statement saying China has ‚Äúrepeatedly raised concerns‚Äù about US export controls in the tech sector. Liu added that China urges the US to ‚Äújointly uphold the consensus reached at the high-level talks in Geneva.‚Äù

Behind the scenes, Bessent told Fox News on Thursday that he believes it might take a direct call between Trump and Xi to salvage the deal. ‚ÄúI think that given the magnitude of the talks, given the complexity, that this is going to require both leaders to weigh in with each other,‚Äù Bessent said. Trump himself confirmed he plans to speak with Xi, saying he hopes they can ‚Äúwork it out.‚Äù

As backup, the White House is working on a Plan B for its trade war strategy, especially after a federal court ruling disrupted parts of Trump‚Äôs current tariff program. That court decision has weakened some of the tools Trump‚Äôs team was using in negotiations, so they‚Äôre looking for alternatives that don‚Äôt rely on those tariffs.

And the pressure campaign doesn‚Äôt stop there. The US has also begun revoking student visas for Chinese nationals studying at American universities. Officials say it‚Äôs part of a broader effort to protect US innovation and prevent intellectual property theft. China‚Äôs Foreign Ministry called the move ‚Äúpoliticized and discriminatory.‚Äù

Chinese officials who were involved in the Geneva talks have said they‚Äôre still willing to keep the conversation going. But their actions don‚Äôt show much urgency. ***Approval for rare earth exports remains blocked. Xi‚Äôs team has not taken any public steps to resume compliance.***

WASHINGTON ‚Äì¬†

Global auto executives are sounding the alarm on an impending shortage of rare-earth magnets from China ‚Äî used in everything from windshield-wiper motors to anti-lock braking sensors ‚Äî that could force the closure of car factories within weeks.

In a previously unreported May 9 letter to Trump administration officials, the head of the trade group representing General Motors, Toyota, Volkswagen, Hyundai and other major automakers raised urgent concerns.



""Without reliable access to these elements and magnets, automotive suppliers will be unable to produce critical automotive components, including automatic transmissions, throttle bodies, alternators, various motors, sensors, seat belts, speakers, lights, motors, power steering, and cameras,"" the Alliance for Automotive Innovation wrote the Trump administration.

The letter, which also was signed by MEMA, The Vehicle Suppliers Association, added that, without those essential automotive components, it would only be a matter of time before U.S. vehicle factories are disrupted.

""In severe cases, this could include the need for reduced production volumes or even a shutdown of vehicle assembly lines,"" the groups said.

Both Alliance CEO John Bozzella and MEMA CEO Bill Long said on Friday the situation was not resolved and remained a concern. They expressed gratitude for the Trump administration's high-level engagement to prevent disruption to U.S. auto production and the supply chain.

Bozzella noted that the automotive issue was on the agenda during Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Rep. Jamieson Greer's talks with their Chinese counterparts in Geneva earlier this month.

Greer told CNBC on Friday that China had agreed to lift restrictions on the exports of rare-earth magnets to U.S. companies and was not moving fast enough to grant access for key U.S. industries. ""We haven't seen the flow of some of those critical minerals as they were supposed to be doing.""

China ‚Äî which controls over 90% of global processing capacity for the magnets used in everything from automobiles and fighter jets to home appliances ‚Äî imposed restrictions in early April requiring exporters to obtain licenses from Beijing.

Rare-earth magnet exports from China halved in April as companies grappled with an opaque application process for permits that sometimes require hundreds of pages of documents.

In a social-media post Friday, President Donald Trump accused China of violating terms of a deal reached this month to temporarily dial back tariffs and other trade restrictions.

""China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH U.S.,"" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform.

China's embassy in Washington responded by saying it was the U.S. that was abusing export controls in the semiconductor sector.

A U.S. official with knowledge of the talks said that only tariffs and Chinese non-tariff countermeasures were covered in Geneva talks, and that U.S. export controls were not part of the deal.

The official also expressed frustration that Beijing appeared to be moving slowly on promises to issue rare-earth export licenses, which could kick start export control retaliation by Washington if automakers vulnerable to shortages of the minerals are forced to halt production.

While a handful of licenses have been granted, including to some Volkswagen suppliers, Indian automakers say they still have received none and will have to stop production in early June.

German auto parts maker Bosch said this week that its suppliers have been bogged down by China's more-rigorous procedures to receive export licenses.

A Bosch spokesperson described the process as ""complex and time-consuming, partly due to the need to collect and provide a lot of information.""

***Executive Summary***

***Overview***

***US dependence on China for critical minerals and battery supply chains represents a***¬†[***national security risk***](https://warontherocks.com/2024/10/china-clean-technologies-and-national-security/)***, leaving the country potentially vulnerable to military supply chain disruptions, coercion, cyber threats, and risks to key economic sectors. While it is well understood that China dominates key segments of the global market, the degree of US reliance on Chinese suppliers remains unclear due to data limitations. Current trade data fails to capture firm-level dependencies and market concentration fully, impeding policymakers‚Äô ability to make informed decisions. This brief examines the global battery supply chain, identifies gaps in trade data, and outlines four key recommendations for improving US tracking of import reliance.***

I'm thrilled to be here on Reddit, sharing a piece of my heart with you all. This is my very first post, so bear with me as I dive into something deeply personal‚Äîmy journey to writing my first children‚Äôs storybook!



Ever since I was a kid, I‚Äôve been enchanted by the magic of stories. I‚Äôd spend hours lost in colorful picture books, dreaming up adventures with quirky characters and whimsical worlds. Those moments shaped me, and as I grew up, I realized I wanted to create that same spark of wonder for other kids. Life took me on a winding path‚Äîjuggling jobs, family, and the chaos of everyday life‚Äîbut the dream of writing a children‚Äôs book never faded.



About a year ago, I finally took the plunge. I started scribbling ideas during late-night coffee runs and early morning quiet moments. My goal was to craft a story that‚Äôs not just fun but meaningful‚Äîone that kids could giggle over while learning a little something about kindness, courage, or maybe just the joy of being themselves. The result is my book, a labor of love filled with vibrant characters and a heartfelt message. It‚Äôs called \[5- Minutes Stories of Kindness and Sibling Love\], and it‚Äôs designed to bring smiles to kids and maybe even a nostalgic grin to parents reading along.



I won‚Äôt lie‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt easy! There were moments of doubt, endless revisions, and times when I wondered if I‚Äôd ever get it right. But every time I pictured a child flipping through the pages, laughing or asking questions, it kept me going. I worked with an amazing illustrator to bring the story to life, and seeing those first sketches felt like pure magic.



I‚Äôd love to share this journey with you all and hear your thoughts! If you‚Äôre curious, you can check out the book here: \[Insert Your Book Link\]. I‚Äôm not here to just drop a link and run‚ÄîI‚Äôd genuinely love to connect with this community, hear about your favorite kids‚Äô books, or even swap stories about what inspires you to create. What are some books your kids (or your inner child!) can‚Äôt get enough of?

1kzuzt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/honesttechreviews/comments/1kzuzt9/30_days_with_the_sihoo_m57_8_features_that/,30 days with the sihoo m57: 8 features that actually make it a smart buy for home offices,"Let‚Äôs be real. 

Most ‚Äúergonomic‚Äù chairs are like gym memberships; full of hope, totally useless by week three.

I‚Äôve owned ‚Äúbargain‚Äù chairs that looked sharp until my spine started plotting revenge. Even the ones that promise ‚Äúbreathable mesh‚Äù usually end up smelling like a locker room.

So, when the SIHOO M57 landed, I was ready to roast it.

Spoiler: I‚Äôm still sitting in it, and here‚Äôs exactly why.

# Setup isn‚Äôt a nightmare (finally)

Box showed up looking way too small for a real chair. I was 90% sure something was missing. But nope‚Äîeverything was packed in like ergonomic Tetris.

Instructions? Actually readable. Didn‚Äôt even curse once. Built solo in under 40 minutes, and that‚Äôs with me getting distracted by my phone twice.

If you can build IKEA stuff without crying, you‚Äôll be fine.

# The mesh back‚Äîsaves your shirt, not just your back

Small home office, single window, full sun. By June, it‚Äôs a sauna in here.

Most mesh chairs start strong, then sag or trap heat. Not this one. Zero sweat stains. No musty smells, even after I spilled coffee on it day eight. Still looks (and smells) fresh.

IYKYK: Bad mesh ruins a summer. This mesh is what sold me.

# Adjustable everything (even if you‚Äôre only touching 3 controls)

Marketing loves throwing out numbers. 3D armrests, adjustable headrest, lumbar knob, recline lock. I messed with them all the first day, then never again.

Found my ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù‚Äîlumbar cranked out, armrests at keyboard height, recline locked just enough to fake good posture on Zoom.

Seriously, 90% of the value comes from lumbar, recline, armrest tweaks. The rest? Meh, nice to have.

(If you‚Äôre curious,[ here‚Äôs the direct link](https://lvnta.com/lv_R5Z06GLnguzk8T1wtl), see if it fits your setup)

# Lumbar support that‚Äôs not just marketing

This knob is the real MVP. Most chairs, ‚Äúlumbar‚Äù just means ‚Äúslightly bulgy curve.‚Äù Here, it actually moves and stays where you put it.

After three hours of spreadsheet hell, my lower back didn‚Äôt lock up for once. That hasn‚Äôt happened in years.

You want less back pain by 3PM? This matters more than you think.

# Recline: not for naps, but perfect for rage-browsing Reddit

126¬∞ isn‚Äôt full ‚Äúnap mode,‚Äù but it‚Äôs prime for leaning back during meetings or deep dives into YouTube rabbit holes.

Side note: The first time I tried to over-recline, I nearly flopped backward‚Äîuser error. It locks in solid, though. No weird creaks or scary surprises.

# Armrests: adjust like a champ, feel like budget airlines

All the movement you want: up, down, in, out, twisty. But after a long gaming night, my elbows felt like I‚Äôd been leaning on a cafeteria tray.

Here‚Äôs my life hack‚Äîtoss a folded hoodie over the arms if you care about comfort. Not a flex, just facts.

# Good for medium builds‚Äînot a Cinderella fit for tall folks

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù and land squarely in the ‚Äúworks perfectly‚Äù zone. If you‚Äôre 6‚Äô2‚Äù or taller, sorry, this isn‚Äôt your Cinderella moment.

Headrest goes missing and the seat might feel like a kid‚Äôs desk chair.

# Rolls easy, no weird noises, still looks new

Dragged this thing across the room to vacuum‚Äîexpected a squeak, got nothing. Wheels glide on hardwood, carpet, even my old yoga mat.

Mesh is still tight, frame isn‚Äôt wobbly. No ‚Äúbudget‚Äù creaks. Not a flex, just facts.

# Build quality: survives abuse, still under $200

It‚Äôs not going to impress the status crowd. But at this price? Frame is solid, mesh is still bouncy, and nothing‚Äôs gone wobbly after 30 days of me slouching, leaning, spinning.

Function over flex. That‚Äôs what matters here.

# Weird quirks & real annoyances

* Mesh seat is firm. If you like plush, you‚Äôll notice‚Äîespecially after a late-night binge.  
* Armrests are all business. No padding. Toss a hoodie over them if you care.  
* Recline tension knob is hiding somewhere awkward. Feels like they designed it for contortionists.  
* Only comes in ‚Äúoffice black.‚Äù If you want a color pop, look elsewhere.  
* Headrest is there for medium builds, giants, not so much.  
* Coffee spill test: Passed. No weird stains, didn‚Äôt hold a smell. That‚Äôs a win.  

# Verdict: way better than I expected, but not magic

If you work from home, game a lot, or just want your back to hate you less, this chair is a steal.

Don‚Äôt expect clouds or premium padding. But if you want solid function, less sweat, and you‚Äôre not built like an NBA forward, this is the move.

It wasn‚Äôt a recovery. It was a reorg.

The original systems were compromised ‚Äî cognitive, emotional, physical.  
The update was not optional.

After extensive internal disruption, all personnel have been reassigned.  
Legacy titles no longer apply.

üß† *Former: Highly Functional Human*

Key departments have merged, split, or gone rogue entirely:

* **Memory & Messaging** now reports to **Instinct & Improvisation.**
* **Speech Processing** is under review, pending clarification.
* **Executive Function** was furloughed indefinitely.

A few updates of note:

* Thought pipelines are slower, but more considered.
* Emotional escalations now include soft exits and safe words.
* The calendar syncs to energy levels, not external deadlines.
* Coffee is still mandatory. But now, so is rest.

Please be advised:

* Performance reviews have been suspended until morale improves.

Don't Look Up & Greenland are predictive programming. 4/13/2029,"The asteroid named 99942Apophis is probably Wormwood from the 7 year  tribulation period of Revelation (God's wrath). Named after an evil serpent demon of chaos & disorder, by NASA, in 2004. Discovered by Kitt Peak National Observatory 1500 ft wide (450 meters) &  550 ft tall (170 meters) 4 NFL football fields. Traveling 28,000 MPH. It's 20 million metric tons or 40 billion pounds in weight. The explosion will equal 880 million tons of TNT. That's 65,000 times more powerful than Hiroshima nuclear explosion. Revelation 8:10-12 & Luke 21:25-28 The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water.¬†The name of the star is Wormwood.¬†A third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from the water, because it had been made bitter. (It will poison 1/3 of the water.) 

It should be visible by telescope in 2025. It should be visible with naked eye in 2027. It should hit California & Mexico border in April, on Friday the 13th, in 2029. The information is from Tom Horn (he got a vision from God & realized that the  asteroid named Apophis matched the vision) on Sid Roth TV show. The Apophis asteroid is on Wikipedia. The video is on YouTube. Study Bible eschatology. They say Apophis was discovered on¬†June 19, 2004 (possibly more likely around 1994). They originally said that Apophis would hit Southern California on April 13, 2029. That's 25-35 years between discovery & possible impact. Then they changed their statement to say that it would miss Earth on that date, by 20,000 miles. I think that they're lying, like the government in the movie, ""Don't Look Up."" Here are some movies showing predictive programming of an asteroid hitting Earth.The Deep Impact movie was released on May 8, 1998. The Armegeddon movie was released on June 30, 1998. Touched by an angel Season 9 Episode 1 is an asteroid similar to Apophis. Aired September 28, 2002. Meteor Apocalypse released in February 23, 2010. Quantum Apocalypse released on February 24, 2010. The movie Seeking a Friend for the End of the World was released on June 22, 2012.

The movie Greenland was released on July, 20, 2020. The movie Don't Look Up was released on December 10, 2021. The movie Mira was released on December 22, 2022. NASA lied about the moon landing, too. NASA stands for Never A Straight Answer & Not A Space Agency. Watch Antichrist45 on YouTube or Rumble or Antichrist45.com. The rapture & Antichrist are close. The tribulation period starts when Donald Trump finishes the Abraham Accords like in Daniel & Revelation. It will be 7 years of God's wrath. Jesus Christ saves us from the wrath. Look up the Hosea prophecy & Fig Tree Prophecy. Please watch Don't Look Up again. I believe the movie is revealing a lot of truth. It appears to mimic President Trump & Elon Musk, the comet hits near San Diego just like NASA originally said the Apophis/Wormwood asteroid would hit, the morning talk show has RIP (rest in peace) all over the show (it's on their cups). NASA  says their sending Osiris Apex to collect specimens from Apophis in April 2029. 

Osiris is an Egyptian god (fallen angel) often portrayed with his arms crossed in the shape of an X. He was resurrected in Egyptian mythology. I believe that represents the Antichrist after he gets possessed by Satan after receiving a deadly wound, then he comes back to life & demands worldwide worship & the Image & Mark of the Beast. I believe that the satanic Illuminati often pose with their arms crossed to show their allegiance to the Antichrist & satan. The Antichrist looses his right eye. That's why the Illuminati members cover one eye. To show allegiance to the Antichrist & satan. Elon plans to send humans to Mars from 2029-2031. He's trying to escape with Trump, like at the end of Don't Look Up. In Don't Look Up, the RIP on the coffee mugs is Rest in Peace, because Wormwood asteroid is Apophis. NASA lied. They told us it's going to hit near Southern California on April 13, 2029. Then changed their minds. In the movie, Greenland, at 1 hour 33 minutes, the lady on the car radio reads about the Wormwood asteroid from Revelation 8. Don't Look Up & Greenland are what is really going to happen in 2029. Trust the Holy Bible. Please study & share this on social media & with your friends & family. 

I highly recommend the gotquestions app for answers to thousands of Bible questions.  Go to YouTube channel LXXXVIII finis temporis it's Latin for End of the World 88. Trump Ordinal gematria = 88. The rapture & Antichrist are close. Obey Jesus. Look up  Antichrist45 on YouTube or Rumble or Antichrist45.com. Trump is the Antichrist & Elon's Neuralink is the Mark of the Beast. The Antichrist spirit controlled artificial intelligence Image of the Beast technology from Revelation 13 is already live & manipulates all digital media worldwide. It's ready for The Antichrist.

...and he spends ¬£100,000 ùêö ùê∞ùêûùêûùê§ on ads.

My man, Marc got giddy! He did a quick elevator pitch on DBR + AI and knocked up a quick demo whilst his mate ‚Äònipped to the John‚Äô. Rather than being blown away, He ùê†ùêöùêØùêû ùêåùêöùê´ùêú'ùê¨ ùêùùêûùê¶ùê® ùê≠ùê°ùêû ùêõùê´ùêÆùê¨ùê°-ùê®ùêüùêü.

The guy explained he already had a funnel that he diverts his traffic to which automatically messages people, follows up with them and collects their documents.

Marc was pretty bummed out - This should have been a shoo-in for him.

And he came looking for advice.

Trying to ùêúùê®ùêßùêØùê¢ùêßùêúùêû this guy that what we're doing could be better, is going to hurt his ego.

That doesn't mean it's all over.

You know the kind‚Äîgreen-labeled tubs, promises of ‚Äúno crash,‚Äù ‚Äúzero jitters,‚Äù and ‚Äúnaturally sourced caffeine.‚Äù

Sounds perfect, right?

But here‚Äôs the part that messes people up:

They chase *smooth energy* and ignore what‚Äôs happening *after* their workout.

# It‚Äôs not about the energy boost‚Äîit‚Äôs about what follows

A lot of ‚Äúclean‚Äù or ‚Äúnatural‚Äù pre-workouts use plant-based caffeine blends, yerba mate, or green coffee extract.

That stuff hits slower, feels lighter.

And people assume that means it‚Äôs easier on the body.

What they don‚Äôt see is how it keeps stress hormones elevated longer.

No crash = nice.

But *no crash* can also mean *no come down*.

If your body stays wired, even subtly, hours after you‚Äôve trained‚Äîyour recovery window gets screwed.

# Cortisol doesn't care how ‚Äúnatural‚Äù your energy source is

You spike it from the workout.

That‚Äôs normal.

But if your pre keeps it elevated well into the day, you‚Äôre basically halving your recovery.

Sleep can get weird.

Muscle soreness lasts longer.

And people think ‚Äúmaybe I need a stronger post-workout stack.‚Äù

No, you probably need a *shorter stimulation tail.*

# The sneaky fatigue loop

Here‚Äôs what usually happens:

* Take clean pre  
* Feel great during the session  
* Get home, still feel ‚Äúon‚Äù  
* Sleep like garbage  
* Wake up sluggish  
* Think you didn‚Äôt dose high enough  
* Add more next time  

Repeat until you‚Äôve completely mistaken *stimulant hangover* for ‚Äúlow energy baseline.‚Äù

And that‚Äôs when people start stacking with nootropics, adaptogens, and worse‚Äîmore caffeine.

# Signs your natural pre is hurting more than helping

* You feel *tired but wired* after lifting  
* Heart rate stays high well into the evening  
* You need a downer (like magnesium or CBD) to sleep after evening workouts  
* Recovery feels slower even though training hasn‚Äôt changed  
* You start needing the pre even on rest days ‚Äújust to function‚Äù

# What to actually look for instead

It‚Äôs not about cutting pre completely.

But check for:

* Total caffeine amount (not just ‚Äúsources‚Äù)  
* How long the blend stays active (some last 6+ hours)  
* If it contains anything that extends half-life (like theanine or adaptogens)  
* When you train (late-day sessions = higher risk of sleep wreckage)  

A good pre gets you focused and ready‚Äîbut also lets you *come down* naturally so your body can shift into recovery.

If your nervous system is still partying at 9PM, you‚Äôre not rebuilding.

You‚Äôre just spinning wheels in a different gear.

# TL;DR

* Natural ‚â† harmless  
* ‚ÄúClean‚Äù energy blends can silently wreck recovery  
* Long-lasting caffeine is still long-lasting stress

I've been buying and selling some things on Facebook marketplace and folks seem unwilling to set a time. ""I'll be there around tomorrow morning"" or ""mid afternoon""

When I've tried to politely ask for a time people seem to push back

Do people just stay at home all day so broad windows of ""tomorrow morning"" work for you? Is there an implicit actual time that I should expect when people speak in broad strokes?

\- Sammy eats 8 cups a day plus plenty of treats - 4 cups in the AM after he has peed and pooped and 4 cups around his dinner time anywhere from 5:30-8 pm  
\- He eats in his maze bowl  
\- Make sure he goes into his crate and sits and waits for you to fill up his bowl. Say ‚ÄúCrate, Sit, stay‚Äù he will be excited and may do a few laps into his crate and then out again before he stays in there. When the food is closed/covered you can say ‚ÄúOkay‚Äù and he will zip to start eating his food.  
\- Most important thing is to make sure he stays relatively calm for 30 mins - 1 hour after eating. Keep him in the mud room with the gate up - he will whine and freak out but don‚Äôt let him out.  
\- Make sure he always has fresh water in his bowl  
\- You can give him treats, 1 dentabone a day, and 1 additional bone treat per day (an Oinkie, chicken rawhide, whatever we have in the cabinet). He also loves ice cubes so feed him as many as you want!  
\- You can also give him a raw marrow bone 1/day when you need him to be occupied - like when you leave the house and want to distract  
\- All of his treats and drugs are in the top cupboard in the hall  
  
Walking/Potty/Lifestyle  
\- I don‚Äôt recommend walking him - he is a lot of dog to walk and it may just be safest to avoid walks :)  
\- If you do walk him, use the prong collar at the upper part of his next; he does pretty well about not pulling with that  
\- We walk him around the neighborhood behind us - usually pretty quiet  
\- There are some dogs with invisible fences at a few houses - some are barky, but we just walk on the opposite site of the street and use treats to distract  
\- If there‚Äôs another dog out for a walk, walk on the opposite site of the street and use treats to distract  
\- Bring the fanny pack with treats and poop bag(s)  
\- He sleeps on the dog bed in the bedroom - if you say ‚Äúplace‚Äù he should go there; if he get‚Äôs up early in the morning, just say ‚Äúplace‚Äù and ignore him and he‚Äôll go back to bed. You are also welcome to have him sleep in the bed with you but he tends to run in his sleep so just beware :D  
\- Morning - sometimes he won‚Äôt poop in the AM because he is too excited to eat. In that case, let him out to pee, then hang around in the house for like 20-30 mins (go back to sleep, lay on the couch with him, etc) and then let him out to poop so he goes before his breakfast.  
\- He will wake up when you wake up - if he is anxious in the morning and keeps trying to come to your bedside, you can tell him to go to his ‚Äúplace‚Äù until you are ready to go out. I‚Äôd say just take him out by 10 latest in the morning (we usually take him out and feed him around 8 am, but he can sleep in). You can also let him in the bed with you to snuggle if you want but beware he will do some morning stretching antics and then calm down and probably try to take over the bed for more sleeping. Watch your face - the Great Dane slap is a strong one.  
\- Let him out every few hours to use the bathroom. He can poop anywhere from 2-4 times a day. Usually 1-2 times in the morning and then once at night after dinner. When you are just hanging on the couch, he will usually tell you if he has to go outside- you can ask ‚Äúdo you need to go outside?‚Äù and he will usually either get excited and thats how ya know! He hasn‚Äôt had an accident in our house.  
\- Evening - try to get him to run around the yard a bit to get some energy out before his dinner or before bed.  
\- He will happily sleep on the green couch upstairs and he will probably want to be wherever you are.  
\- If he sees other people, dogs, mailman outside, he will anxiously bark. Just tell him ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and he will eventually calm down. Watch out for drinks on the couch/ coffee table as when he is excited his tail is dangerous and no one/drink is safe.  
\- His happy place is the couch. If he is playing and getting too mouthy you can just shove his hedgehog in his mouth to avoid him from nipping. He never bites down but he has big teeth so it can get annoying.  
\- Note that he doesn‚Äôt like the rain, so sometimes he requires some coaxing so go outside; sometimes I stand out on the deck while he pees so that he doesn‚Äôt just run right back inside.

The guests staying over are religious in Christianity, so just while they're here, I guess I'm 'in the closet,' as to avoid anything unnecessary (I don't really mind if they know, I'm more worried they'll tell our grandmother who is SUPER religious and thinks anything that isn't Christian must be the devil. She doesn't even like that I have a mohawk.)

But I still wanted to give a cup of coffee to Zeus, so I did that, apologized for still being in my pajamas, and for not giving the first offering to Lady Hestia as I usually do, explaining that while we have guests, I'm worshipping in stealth, and thanked them for understanding. 

Now the part I'm wondering if anyone else has done; I try to be pretty honest most of the time, not only for myself, but for the gods as well since it just feels like something they'd want me to do. But in order to practice in stealth, I had already thought up an excuse for the second cup of coffee, so I asked Zeus to forgive me in advance if I lied to protect my practice, since I had planned on answering, ""Oh I poured it for myself and just forgot, but I'll take care of it.""

Has anyone else told the gods you've lied or were about to lie? Or have you explained to the gods that you might need to do something dishonest for a reason?

1kzupg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1kzupg1/how_do_i_get_in_more_fluids/,How do I get in more fluids,"Im notorious for not drinking more fluids. Im chronically dehydrated. Im also never thirsty.  (My dad is the same way). I also hate water. When I order a meal, I will get water then go the entire meal with only a sip. If I order a soda or tea, I will have at least 1 refill. 
I can not drink diet sodas or additives to water because the artificial sweeteners give me migraines.  
I need some tips on how to consume more fluids without adding tons more calories.  
My typical day of fluids looks like this:
Coffee with palm sugar and milk
Breakfast meal shake (I take my pills with this usually) 8-12 oz
12oz fizzy water (or soda) at lunch (since starting Zepbound,  it tastes icky) sometimes lunch is a meal shake
Maybe a 16oz bottle of water during the day
Small amount of water (4oz give or take) at supper. Or a glass of juice (8-12oz) or a sprite 
4oz of water (give or take) to take evening meds. 


I know I get fluids through foods. I also have sodium restrictions (thats why Gatorade is only after yard work or being sick) I can not do hydrating drinks but once in a while. I also take a diuretic in the morning for menieres disease and high BP. I also have to limit caffeine due to PVCs. Im slowly lowering my intake again. 

My doctor said I need more water, I know I need more water. Im just not thirsty nor do I desire much water. I also can not do much citrus in the water due to a painful bladder issue that can be set off with high acid foods. 

Now, I love milk. But since I've been on Zepbound,  Im not drinking any beyond the meal replacement shakes I do for breakfast and sometimes lunch. 

Im just not getting enough fluids. I avoid drinking water at work because Im a teacher and I can't go to the restroom when I need to. Its summer so Id like to do better. 

So,any ideas?

1kzun98,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1kzun98/having_a_hard_time_making_friends/,Having a hard time making friends üòû,"I'm 25, and I've been dealing with depression since I was around 14. Lately, it's been flaring up every so often, for one reason - I'm having a hard time making any genuine friends. I woke up this morning and kinda just felt like crying again, so thought I'd make a post instead to vent some of it out.

1-2 years ago, my old childhood friend group disbanded, and it didn't disband in a nice way. Most of us had just become busy, grown into different people, but I had a massive fight with an ex friend, which kinda instigated the end of everything. They said some horrible things about me, and while they apologised and genuinely seemed to feel terrible, I just couldn't forgive them, it was too much.. So, I left. Friend group of over 10 years disbanded after that, and it sucked. 

I was able to make friends with a guy at work, but this friendship felt like crack to me (lol). It was unhealthy, they were very toxic, and seems they were only interested in being friends if it meant there was something a lil extra on the side (If you know what I mean), which I wasn't interested in, so the friendship ended with him ghosting me cause he wanted more & I just wanted a best friend. He broke my heart honestly. 

After that, I tried meeting new people. I put myself out there and ended up going on a date (Bro, I never go on dates by choice since I'm not super into that stuff, so this was really out there for me), but felt we got along better as friends. I left it up to her as to whether she wanted to remain friends or keep looking for a partner, and she decided she didn't want to remain friends. Sucked, she was a kind friend, I thought. 

So, I started reaching out to old friends to see if I could connect with anyone. Ended up going out a few times with my high school best friend, but she got a better job, and disappeared after a few months. She hasn't reached out to me since. 

I bumped into a few other old friends over the years who claimed to want to hang out too, but they never followed through, all just empty promises. 

Eventually, one old high school friend decided to stick around, and that was great! My first actual, genuine friend in years. We'd go for coffee, and go play mini golf and get drunk, it was fun. They introduced me to their friend group, who are all very nice, but I always still felt like.. The friend on the edge of the group?

Then, without going into details, they did something really shitty. They used me to hurt someone. Everything blew up. I'm still friends with everyone from their friend group (Just not them, they were swiftly exiled after that) and we hang out as a group every so often, but.. None of them ever want to hang out one on one? So I still feel.. Alone. 

Only good thing to come out of that was I've been dating & moved in with one of the people from the friend group, and that's pretty much..  My only genuine connection..

Recently, I keep having to watch them go to hang out with his friends. They actually ask him to hang out, noone ever asks me? It's always.. Me chasing others who seemingly show interest, but end up leaving after a while. 

I tried reaching out to another old friend more recently, and trying to get them to talk to me felt like pulling hairs. In the end, they changed their mind & ghosted me. 

I even went to a co-workers birthday party, but my autistic ass apparently misread the unspoken party rules or something?? I got there early, and once the bar opened, sat down at an empty table to reserve it for my co-worker friends. They all arrived hours late, said hi, then went to sit at a completely different table, despite me having gotten there early to reserve one for everyone?? I ended up feeling isolated and hurt, though the host was really nice & kept coming to check on me (Maybe she pitied me), so I eventually said goodbye to her and left. Walked home in the rain feeling terrible.

Thought I was being nice y'kno, reserving everyone a table? But I ended up sitting alone for 3 hours. Like a big dumb idiot. 

I've been feeling really depressed lately over it.. I feel like something must be wrong with me for all these people to not want to get to know me personally, and it's really been making me feel crap. Every time my partner goes to spend time with friends, I feel shitty and alone.. He's currently got plans to play video games with one of his friends, so I'm low key hiding in the toilet cus I don't want him to know I'm sad and worry about me lmao, he's a bit too good at reading when I'm feeling down. 

Idk man.. Making friends is really hard. Nobody wants to actually put in the effort I feel. I miss having close connections. I miss having someone message me just to ask simple things like, ""How are you?"" 

I've got these friends in my friend group, and my partner keeps saying, I can just reach out to them, but.. I want someone to actually want to put in the effort? I keep being the one to instigate, and I get hurt after a while when they eventually ghost me.. I don't want to risk it anymore. 

I also don't want to risk people getting the wrong idea and thinking I'm interested in them in a not so friendship kinda way? It keeps happening where people get the wrong impression, and then they leave when they realise I just want to be friends, and I feel used. 

I don't want a courtesy friendship, I want genuine connection.. But I feel.. Broken? 

My heart feels heavy. I'm gonna take a nap, thanks to anyone who read my vent, I appreciate it. ‚ô•Ô∏è",1,1748690128.0,depression,2,1.0,False

So I've noticed my decision quality drops after 3pm-ish‚Ä¶ and realized more coffee makes it worse (apparently there‚Äôs an explanation, but I‚Äôll leave that for Google).

When I realized that most of my problematic decisions happened in the afternoon, I started blocking my calendar for important decisions before lunch.

But sometimes urgent decisions can't wait. So I got used to writing this in Claude (should work about the same with ChatGPT)

    ""I need to make a decision about [decision]. My energy levels are low right now. Please help me:
    1. Determine if this decision can wait until tomorrow morning
    2. If urgent, what are the 2-3 core factors I should focus on
    3. What key question would help clarify my thinking
    4. What perspective am I likely overlooking due to fatigue""

It takes the mental load off structuring my thinking when I'm tired but still gives me the final say. Been a game-changer for those can't-wait decisions that pop up at 4pm.

Would actually love to get some ideas for improving this snippet - I find that the more I use these things the more I get ideas what to improve in the ‚Äúprompt‚Äù (ugh)‚Ä¶ so would be cool to hear from others what questions I can add etc

1kzugf6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kzugf6,A little something from my trip to Korea,"So while on my trip, I thought it would be nice to get something memorable, maybe a Korea-themed keycap set? I was mainly using an HHKB for the past few years, so getting something with more customization options for a change seemed like a good idea. 

At first nothing came up, but after some time searching I found [Pompokey](https://pompokey.com/), a Seoul-based mech keyboard store, and they produce a [custom Busan keycap set](https://pompokey.com/products/pompokey-busan-keycap) which was exactly what I was looking for. 

I messaged them on Instagram, turned out they don't have an offline store, but they were kind enough to allow me to come to their office near Daksan station and get the keycap set in person. They sent me an invoice via Paypal so I could pay with a card, offered me a coffee, spoke perfect English, showed me what else they have in stock, let me test some of the switches on a sample keyboard, and generally treated me like their dear friend. I ended up getting some [semi-silent linear switches](https://pompokey.com/products/jerrzi-taro-semi-silent-linear-switches-factory-lubed-10pcs) from them as well. They also showed me some prototype keycaps from the upcoming Seoul themed set, which were quite impressive, giving off that nighttime Seoul neon signs vibe.

So I just really wanted to give them a huge shout out for such a warm welcome. 

Another shout out and thank you I wanted to give to [Funkeys](https://funkeys.co.kr/), they have a great showroom store in Seoul with a variety of keyboards, keycaps and switches in stock. Initially I got Varmilo Sword68 Ariel version from them, but the next day I changed my mind, and they were kind enough to let me return it and change it for Varmilo Sword68 Black Barebone version and a bag of TTC Frozen v2 switches (just in case the semi-silents turn out to be too loud).

So all in all, a stellar A+ mkb shopping experience in Seoul. If you are there, make sure to check out both stores, as well as [Leaderskey](https://www.leaderskey.com/) which I didn't have a chance to visit, but it was also recommended in some other threads. You can easily google the threads with detailed instructions on how to walk to Funkeys and Leaderskey stores, and for Pompokeys just dm them first to make sure they have what you want in stock, since it's not a store but rather an office.",22,1748689423.0,MechanicalKeyboards,1,0.96,False

1kzuaga,https://www.reddit.com/r/kobo/comments/1kzuaga/kobo_clara_bw_is_not_for_me/,kobo clara bw is not for me,"just received my kobo clara bw in the mail yesterday and was so excited to get it! i had done quite a bit of research while trying to decide what ereader i wanted to go with as i have never had one before but really liked the concept of them.
sadly, the minute i opened up the box i was disappointed. for starters, i hadn‚Äôt been able to tell what the texture of the body of the device was until it was in my hands. i‚Äôm neurodivergent and do struggle with a certain few textures, this happens to be one of them. i immediately was turned off by the feeling, it just made me squirm. i had decided to hold off on buying a case until i had it in my hands so the texture alone wasn‚Äôt a huge deal. 
i will say that on top of the texture, i had no idea the device itself was going to look and feel so cheap. i don‚Äôt know what i was expecting for an ereader that i paid $150 for, but i can very honestly admit i thought it would be quite a bit more sleek. the body, the screen, and the fact that the whole device seems paper thin all sort of turned me off. don‚Äôt get me wrong, i‚Äôm glad that it feels so portable and like it wouldn‚Äôt absolutely bog down my bag if i wanted to throw it in there and head to a coffee shop or something. i just wasn‚Äôt prepared for it to feel like i was holding a children‚Äôs toy.
again, i had planned to buy a case so that alone could have remedied most of my complaints but then, i turned the device on. the very first thing i did was raise the brightness a bit when i noticed that the circle on the brightness bar was leaving ‚Äúghost‚Äù images on my screen. (pardon me for not knowing the real term. i know what screen burn is that used to happen on older smartphones or tv‚Äôs but no clue what the equivalent verbiage is for e-ink screens).
i followed the quick 10 step informational tutorial that it prompted me to and each slide left layered ghost images that got increasingly worse as i flipped through to the end.
truly it was an immediate turnoff. i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve ever been so instantly displeased with a product. i wanted to love this device so bad. i joined this sub prematurely and got more and more excited day by day as i saw other kobo owners enjoying and praising their own devices. i haven‚Äôt yet looked into whether what i experienced with the ghost images is normal or not, either normal for kobo clara‚Äôs or e-readers in general. regardless, if it‚Äôs normal in any way i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm evolved enough to enjoy an ereader the way i thought i would. back to the drawing board it is for me! no hate to this brand, just wanted to share my ‚Äúunboxing‚Äù experience in case anyone else is on the fence and looking for more input before buying!

My biggest question is - is she really going to accuse James of all this? How is this not criminal? Is it because she has already plead guilty to lying about it, so he can't be charged? I mean in this documentary she literally says he kidnapped her, held her against her will, SAed her, and physically ab*sed her/tortured her. She's really saying all that on an HBO series. She also called him a psychopath or sociopath when asked how he passed his poly with flying colors and she lied on hers. 

I really can't with the poly administrator; his questioned didn't make sense to me. Specifically: ""at any point during the 22 days did James Reyes tell you that you were free to leave?"" Sherri answers ""no"" and he ""believes her."" 

Umm yeah he probably didn't say that at any point during the 22 days because he didn't have to?? She was there willingly?

I did almost spit out my coffee when they gagged her with ""James' mother isn't Hispanic. She's Irish."" Sherri just blinked LOL. 

Everyone kept saying she was in a horrible marriage and Keith was so awful and she even said ""I'm ready to expose Keith"" but did I miss it or did no one actually say anything negative that he did?

I'm glad that there is the implication that the production team doesn't believe her and even her parents said it wasn't a kidnapping, but I really could have done without all the mental health professionals backing her up.

24F, slim, already had an endoscopy and been diagnosed with a lax LES and my esophagus looks healthy. 

so i don‚Äôt usually deal with bad nausea/heart burn day to day. i would say my main issue is globus, and i occasionally get a little bit of heart burn if i‚Äôm hungry. however, a few times a year i get a really bad flare up that last maybe 3-7 days. it includes constant heartburn, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, stabbing chest pain etc. even drinking water hurts during this, and i stick to bland food and take PPIs / antacids / gaviscon advance to manage symptoms even tho they don‚Äôt help that much tbh. i can‚Äôt remember exactly what i ate before this flare up and the last one started tbh, but i mainly do eat the same things. 


i‚Äôm haven‚Äôt been on any PPIs for the past few months since i felt the exact same on and off them, and i would still get these bad flare ups even if i was on them. i usually just make sure to take gaviscon advance (uk) before bed, and if i‚Äôve had a particularly heavy or acidic meal i take it after that too. i haven‚Äôt started avoiding any food unless it‚Äôs in a flare up, and i still drink decaf coffee, eat curry, and eat chocolate (although i am trying to cut down on that).

In complete disbelief at this vendetta from the transport industry I remained transfixed as they walked past me and out of view.

A few seconds later and elderly man, wearing a medium length black jacket, silver hair and dark piercing eyes looked deeply at me through sunken sockets.

He was making a interlocked fingers gesture, hands held at rib cage height and was smiling knowingly at me.

Honestly not knowing myself but aware he was peering into my soul, spirit or whatever else it's called, he gave a slight smile and raised one of his eyebrows.

A few seconds later he talked to another man nearby, then disappeared from sight. A minute after that and the transport guy with two armed guards (guards also in orange) left the cafe and walked past me across the zebra crossing.

Someone shouted something and one of the guards, a big black man wearing a black headscarf in the middle of the day made a theatrical gesture across the street.

On reflection it seems that I am being chased by an unknowable number of people, trying to end my journey. Hopefully my worry is unfounded.

I walked some more and apart from an enjoyable scoop of raspberry ice cream and the rest of the bottle of espresso, after a hour or two I was flagging and saw an entrance near two big steel unlocked doors, which led to a sort of antechamber and another big door. 

It was shaded, which was enough for a siesta so I entered and slouched against my bag in the corner of the room.

After a minute or two I took my trainers off and nodded off for a while.

I was woken a little later by a big Mediterranean guy with missing front teeth bumping into the steel doors and standing imposing in front of them.
We look at each other for a few seconds and then he says, slightly slurred:

""You should leave here. It's no good.""

I gulp inwardly and say, ""its okay"" in a quiet voice.

""NO! It is not.""

He dramatically points a thick index finger into the other corner next to where I am resting.

""...I pee-pee there. It is not dry or good for you."" gently waving a 8.5 percent can of lager in his other hand.

"" Sleep in this other corner instead.""

I say I'm alright but feel a little uneasy about the small space we are in, and he's taller than me and I'm nearly 6 foot, and he has weight.

Putting my trainers on we say a few other things and he says he is going now, walking across the road greeting a passing bus driver and sitting on some cardboard outside the supermarket.

He waves me away saying come here (sigh) and I walk over and he asks to bum a cigarette.

I roll him one and we talk of his music, how crack heads turn into idiots and he can hook me up with hash for 20 euro. I say thanks and he offers me the can of lager, a few gulps worth.

I thank him and drink, and he asks me to leave as it's his spot, and it's not good with two of us.

I understand and stand up and put on my backpack. He offers me a french version of a packet of jammy dodgers. I don't like them much and decline, but he says he has others so I shrug and take the two, we say au revoir and I walk off, soon finding a bin for the biscuit wrapping and empty can.

I walk a little further and for some reason I am drawn to a bar on the corner of the street. 

 I'm not sure I'm going to mention the place yet, as I plan on being there tonight, but it is an English pub and is owned by a fellow Northerner.

Him and the barman, a Portuguese guy whose name I can't remember at the moment are the only ones there. 

I order a pint of beer (noticing it was happy hour after 5pm pushed me over the edge into entering) and I sat at the bar. 

A few minutes later a French lady who I later learn is from Corsica sits next to me and starts talking. 
She's like me, one of the weird ones and talks how great Paris and English is for a minute and then how sad Paris makes her the next. 

She's drinking cocktails and tells me she's working here, sadly. I guess she's an escort but I'm not bothered, I appreciate good conversation.

We all talk together about the music on the radio, a mix of English 80s and 90s music, naming the band and singing quietly.

 The place soon gets busier, and the people are an interesting mix. 

Over the next few hours I'm introduced to a guy from Chicago who works for the US Defense as a submarine officer and attache to the French diplomatically, an Indian-English man and a guy from Hong Kong, amidst a few others. 

Women join the guys, and most are French, one says she's half Mexican (doubtful) and I'm introduced to the American guys wife and two of her friends. 

I talk with them and the others, making conversations with different groups whether at the bar with a drink or outside smoking.

One of the ladies brings some sliced meats from the charcuterie she works at and we cheer her.
I see a type of slice I don't recognise, rectangular, strong and thin, pink and white.

She, curvaceous in a red dress with white circles and shoulder length black hair tells me it's hard to translate, the first part of the word is a hat ""like thees"" moving one hand diagonally near the top of her head, and say frenchmen wear it.

I correctly guessed a beret and the second part of the word was a part of the cow or something but I'm not sure, I'm on my fifth pint and the American ordered me and him a shot of Jameson's for no apparent reason, not that there needs to be one.

A little while later she asks me if she is going to the music quiz, where whoever guesses the song and the artist wins a free shot tomorrow. I said sure it soudns good fun and asks if I want to meet tomorrow at 8pm? 

Like it's nothing I casually agree, we shake hands and she walks away.

I watch her walk feeling pretty good about myself and then return to the bar.

I'm the sort of drunk who can get extravagant at times, and I get the feeling I should go elsewhere. I talk again to the landlord, apologising and thanking in equal measure and I walk drunkenly away.

I walk a few more streets in the centre of Paris and feeling tired put out my sleeping stuff at the side of a garage. The nightlife is still going strong and the bars are playing lively, though it feels like the morning hours.

Apart from the garage door opening to let a scooter with a couple enter, who look at me curiously as I look peacefully drunk back at them, I am woken by the door again hours later and the sun is well up.

Packing my things I noticed that the top of my backpack and one of the side pockets was open. 

Knowing I'm not in the habit of leaving my stuff open before sleep I guess someone stealthily looked through my bag. Finding only clothes and toiletries they didn't take anything.

I walked to a supermarket for some fresh orange, a doughnut and some butter, then go for a coffee. Nearby I buy a pan au Chocolat.

Having ordered two coffees and a cup of tea and numerous cigarettes, eaten the pan au Chocolat and some orange juice, writing this a few hours have passed and my battery has one percent left.

For the most part he‚Äôs been helpful with the baby. He took a week off before I had the baby and a week once the baby was born, but he is always on his PlayStation. I seriously mean always.

He isn‚Äôt affectionate towards me at all‚Ä¶ he never really has been but it‚Äôs been bothering me more lately. I just feel so lonely a lot of the time. We got into a argument tonight because he threw it in my face that he has been putting the two older babies to sleep for the past week all by himself. Which led to me bringing up the game situation. He can be hurtful when he is upset. He ended up saying I‚Äôm not a source of happiness for him and all I do is stress him out. Which he has made comments before like this but I just can‚Äôt do it anymore. He also throws it in my face anytime he buys anything for me. Which is hardly anything like a coffee every once in awhile. I don‚Äôt ask for much at all.

I‚Äôm freshly postpartum, not working and have no one to watch my children if I started working. It‚Äôs just crazy to be treated this way when I just had a baby. All I do is take care of our children and the house. I don‚Äôt go anywhere or do anything else. I just want to be appreciated and loved correctly.

‚Äî 

You know what?
I was a deep Christian.
Not just Bible-on-the-nightstand kind.
I was blindfolded in faith,
sprinting through fire, screaming ‚ÄúHallelujah‚Äù
with skin peeling off,
just to prove I believed.

I didn‚Äôt just know Scripture ‚Äî
I bled it.
I memorized verses like escape routes.
Built altars in my mind,
hoping God would finally sit with me
and stay.

But He never did.
Not really.

I fought every damn day
with this brain that never shuts up.
A.D.H.D ‚Äî
All Demons Howl Daily.
Autism ‚Äî
A Universe That I See, In Hell-Disguise.
My mind a thousand open tabs
with no way to close them.
Thoughts buzzing like flies
around a soul that's already rotting.

People said I was kind.
Deep.
Sweet.
They didn‚Äôt see the screaming
that lived in my silence.
They couldn‚Äôt hear
the scratching on the inside of my skin
as I tried to claw my way out.

I kept looking for light ‚Äî
through the cracks in the wall,
between the broken lines in verses,
between seconds of pretending.
I thought maybe there was a land behind the madness,
something beautiful behind the fog of me.
But I blinked ‚Äî
and it vanished.
Gone.
Like it never existed.

And that‚Äôs when I felt Him leave.
Jesus.
Gone.
Like He slipped out the back door
and didn‚Äôt bother to shut it.

In His place ‚Äî
something ancient.
And smiling.
Satan stood still,
no flames, no pitchfork,
just an open gate
to a graveyard that already knew my name.

The graves whispered as I walked by ‚Äî
each one was someone I trusted,
someone who lied,
each flower a knife dressed in color,
each candle a smiling blade.

Don‚Äôt put flowers on my grave ‚Äî
they‚Äôre knives with perfume.
Don‚Äôt light candles ‚Äî
they‚Äôre just tools
to melt down what‚Äôs left of me.

All that looks beautiful?
It‚Äôs camouflage.
It‚Äôs illusion.
It‚Äôs war paint on betrayal.
It‚Äôs hollow kindness in a silver frame.
Between it all ‚Äî
just another mask to pretend.
To pretend you cared.
To pretend you saw me.
To pretend I wasn‚Äôt already
dead.

And there it was ‚Äî
my grave.
Not metaphor.
Not future.
Just open.
Like it missed me.

I looked down
and saw my body
already inside.
Already emptied.
Already forgotten.

No mourners.
No choir.
No rain to make it poetic.

Just dirt.
And silence.
The kind of silence
that presses your ears
like someone‚Äôs covering them with hands ‚Äî
except it‚Äôs God
and He never speaks.

Because here‚Äôs the truth:

No one will notice.
No one will care.
They‚Äôll scroll past my name
like a boring headline.
Whisper a fake ‚ÄúRest in Peace‚Äù
and then argue about coffee orders.

They don‚Äôt know:
I died long ago.
That I was screaming through every laugh,
pleading through every prayer.
That I begged God to just touch my shoulder
and tell me He saw me.
But the heavens had read receipts
and no reply.

So here‚Äôs the kicker ‚Äî
yeah, I know my Bible.
Isaiah said I was despised and rejected,
familiar with sorrow, and pain dissected.

*Jeremiah* promised hope, plans for my future‚Äôs sake,
but all I got was broken promises I couldn‚Äôt fake.

*Romans* says nothing can separate love‚Äôs strong hold ‚Äî
well, try telling that to a heart so cold.

*Psalm* says ‚ÄúWhy so downcast, soul? Hope in God, stand tall.‚Äù
But when you‚Äôre screaming in silence, does He hear at all?

See, I‚Äôm not blind to scripture‚Äôs shine,
but those verses didn‚Äôt stop the decline.
So don‚Äôt bring me your verses like they‚Äôre saving grace,
I‚Äôve lived beyond those lines ‚Äî I‚Äôve stared death in the face.

So this is it.

Tonight,
I end the echo.

Not because I‚Äôm weak.
But because I was strong
for too damn long.
Because I lit candles for others
that melted my hands to the bone.
Because I sang hallelujah
with a dagger in my spine
and called it worship.

And when I‚Äôm gone?

Don‚Äôt bring flowers.
They‚Äôre knives.
Don‚Äôt bring candles.
They burn.

Don‚Äôt write poems.
I already wrote those ‚Äî
the kind that‚Äôd break your heart reading ‚Äòem,
rip your soul in two,
and leave you begging for mercy.

Go on, try.
But be warned ‚Äî
my words aren‚Äôt soft.
They‚Äôre storms you can‚Äôt weather.
I‚Äôm not here to comfort your ego,
or patch up your pity.
I‚Äôm here to tell truth straight ‚Äî
and if that arrogance burns?
Good. It should.

Because I lived the poetry
you only read about.

And if you think my story‚Äôs done,
you‚Äôre dead wrong ‚Äî I‚Äôm not just anyone.

I screamed my soul in verses sharp and clear,
But you skimmed the surface, too afraid to hear.
My words burn flames, yours barely a spark ‚Äî

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Many products promise help for losing body weight. Most times, they do not work as people wish. I see many people want to know about this coffee, Ryze. They ask if drinking it makes weight go down. I think it is important to look at facts about this product. I will check what Ryze is made of. I will see what information is there about it helping with weight. We will learn if this mushroom coffee is useful for someone trying to lose weight or if it is just a simple drink people like. I will share what I find.

What Exactly is Ryze Mushroom Coffee?
-------------------------------------

I understand Ryze is a drink mix. People put hot water on it. It looks like regular instant coffee powder. But it is different. This mix has coffee powder, but it also has other things. The important additions are powders made from special types of mushrooms. These are called functional mushrooms. The company says it is a healthy morning drink. It gives some energy like coffee. It also gives some extra benefits from the mushrooms. People drink it instead of their usual coffee. It is a simple powder mix you can use at home. This is what Ryze product is.

Exploring Ryze's Key Ingredients and Their Potential Benefits
-------------------------------------------------------------

I know that what is inside a product is important. For Ryze, the main parts are coffee and mushrooms. But it has other things too. The company lists all ingredients on the package. I must look at each one. The mushrooms are a main focus point. People talk about them a lot. They are not like cooking mushrooms you eat. They are special types. Other ingredients also do things for the body. I will check what these main parts are supposed to do. This helps to understand the drink better.

The Power of Functional Mushrooms in Ryze
-----------------------------------------

Ryze contains powders from certain mushrooms. I see names like Lion's Mane, Cordyceps, Reishi. It also lists Turkey Tail, King Trumpet, Shiitake. These are called functional mushrooms. People use them for different reasons. Lion's Mane is often talked about for helping the brain. Cordyceps is sometimes used for energy. Reishi is known for helping feel calm. Turkey Tail is liked for the body's defense system. King Trumpet and Shiitake are also used in some health practices. I understand people hope these mushrooms give good things to the body.

Other Key Ingredients and Their General Effects
-----------------------------------------------

Besides the special mushrooms, Ryze has other parts. It has coffee powder. Coffee gives caffeine. Caffeine helps people feel awake. It gives energy. Some versions of Ryze use a mix that has no caffeine. This is for people who do not want caffeine. Ryze also has MCT oil powder. MCT oil comes from coconuts. Some people use it for energy too. The mix also has spices like cinnamon or flavors like cocoa sometimes. These give taste. They are not mostly for health effects, maybe just for flavor. So, coffee gives energy, and MCT oil might also help with energy.

Addressing the Direct Question: Does Ryze Cause Weight Loss?
------------------------------------------------------------

Many people drink Ryze and ask if it helps them lose body fat. I must be clear on this. There is no strong proof that Ryze coffee itself makes you lose weight. I have not seen scientific studies showing that drinking this specific coffee product causes weight loss in people. It is important to understand this fact. The company does not say it is a weight loss product. People hope it helps because of the ingredients. But science does not show the final product causes weight to drop.

Lack of Specific Ryze Weight Loss Studies
-----------------------------------------

I looked for science papers about Ryze coffee and losing weight. I did not find any studies. Scientists have studied some single ingredients in Ryze. For example, they looked at Cordyceps or MCT oil alone. Some studies on single mushrooms talk about metabolism or fat in animals. But this is not studying the Ryze mix in humans for weight loss. So, we do not have specific science for the Ryze product causing body weight reduction. It is important to rely on facts from studies.

Understanding Supplements vs. Dedicated Weight Loss Products
------------------------------------------------------------

I think it is useful to know the difference. Ryze is like a drink mix or a supplement. It adds something to your diet. True weight loss products or plans are different. These are often guided by doctors or diet experts. They involve strict eating plans. They also require lots of exercise. Some medical treatments or medicines are made just for losing weight. A simple drink like Ryze is not in this group. Its main idea seems to be general well-being, not targeted body fat loss.

Indirect Ways Ryze Might Support Weight Management
--------------------------------------------------

Even if Ryze does not directly cause weight loss, it might help some people in other ways. For example, caffeine from coffee gives energy. More energy might help someone exercise longer. Some mushrooms like Cordyceps are said to help with energy too. Feeling more awake could make you more active. Reishi mushroom is linked to feeling less stressed. Stress can make some people eat more food. So, feeling calmer might help control eating for them. These are possible small, indirect helps, but not guaranteed.

Ryze in the Context of a Healthy Weight Loss Journey
----------------------------------------------------

If someone wants to lose weight, Ryze coffee is not the main answer. It is like a small helper, maybe. A healthy journey to lose weight needs big changes. It needs eating less unhealthy food and eating more healthy food. It also needs moving the body much more. Ryze can be a drink you have while doing these main things. It fits in as part of your day. But you should not think it does the main work for losing weight. The work is in diet and exercise.

The Importance of Diet and Exercise Alongside Supplements
---------------------------------------------------------

I must make this very clear. The biggest power for losing weight comes from two places. These are how you eat and how much you move. Eating healthy food in the right amount is number one. Doing physical activity, like walking or sports, is number two. These two things make the body use stored energy (fat). Supplements like Ryze are very small compared to this. They cannot replace eating less or exercising more. They are just extra things, not the main tools.

Setting Realistic Expectations for Ryze and Weight Loss
-------------------------------------------------------

It is important to think straight about Ryze. If you drink it every day, you should not expect to suddenly lose many kilograms. It is a simple drink with coffee and mushroom powders. Losing body weight takes time. It needs much effort with food and movement. Ryze might make you feel a little different because of caffeine or mushrooms. But it will not do the hard work of weight loss for you. Have true thoughts about what this drink can do. It is not a magic drink for losing size.

Conclusion: Ryze and Your Weight Loss Goals
-------------------------------------------

I have looked at facts about Ryze coffee. It has coffee and special mushrooms inside. People hope the mushrooms give health benefits. For losing body weight, I see no direct proof that Ryze makes it happen. Studies do not show this product causes weight loss. It is a drink like a supplement, not a medical weight loss product. Maybe for some person, feeling more energy from it helps them move more. Or feeling less stressed helps them eat better. But these are small things. If you want to lose weight, you must focus on eating healthy and exercising a lot. Ryze can be a drink you enjoy while you do the real work.

Before we even got into that relationship, actually it was a hole condition for this relationship to happen, I told them that it needs to be okay for them that I don't want like a threesome relationship we're everybody overshares love life and life life etc I don't know if that makes sense. I wanted to have a ""normal"" relationship with some exceptions of course, but I didn't want more info about her than she got about me and vice verca. And explicitly that I don't want to get romantically involved with her.
They agreed to that. More than that, we seemed to be on the same page in that point.
She wanted to meet me. I had no intention at that time, and told him that I don't feel comfortable with that yet. She wanted to though, so he kind of pushed me to it, asking me like every other day because ""it was important for her"" so eventually I gave in to get it over with.
So we went for breakfast to a Caf√© and I needed a lot of time to get warm with a situation I felt hella uncomfortable with. And eventually it was fine because it was just small talk about movies or anime, work etc.
But later that day in the evening when I was home I got told that ""she already imagined a few things she'd like to do with me drunk on a couch""
Now, I am not homophobic. I have had experiences with women and they are just not my type, but I also had some very bad experiences with women not taking no for an answer or just straight up telling me that they can harass me as much as they like because no-one would take it serious so maby I am a little traumatised, but I also think, as an adult, you should be able to drink a first coffee with someone you are generally interested in without having to imagine him or her naked, especially if they told you they're not interested in your sex from the getgo. I told them again and he apologised and told me it'll never come up again.
I belief she tried a few times more but that could have been just Paranoia so I shrugged it off all the time by not reacting to it. But that was the first distance I kept from her, not talking about sexual stuff or just not coming very close.
Next thing he offered me a trip (mdma), and we had a lot of fun. The very next day he went to her, she knew of the trip for some obscure reasons, and he like ghosted me for the whole day because she was jealous about the trip and needed attention, so I was left alone with the blues after that (it was my first trip like that) but I understood her struggle and it just had to be okay in my opinion.
A week later she texted me and told me everything about her experience on the trip because she did it a week later and wanted to talk about it with me. I told her that I didn't even knew about thier trip and if she had been that jealous about mine how'd she expect me to react now. She said sorry for that and that ""she didn't think about it"" not to mention that he stayed with her for the whole week afterwards.
Lot of mistakes, lot of anger to fix it from every site.
A few weeks later I had a bad depression phase but he was with her that weekend. I was at my limit and trying to text to him about it, but a real conversation never came up. The week after she texted me and told me she was very disappointed because she looked forward to this weekend and he was down because I was ""in a mood"" and I should try to find another solution next time I felt bad and he was with her so I don't spoil thier time.
Now at that point, and I don't know if that's understandable, I haven't had the best opinion on her anymore, but I still wanted to make it work, since the man I love loves her as well I might be misinterpretating her behaviour and I am not used to that kind of relationship so we all make mistakes... We all did make mistakes at some point and my bf still wanted us both to be friends.
She wanted to get a meet up between us three to settle some agreements, and like with the first coffee, I was hesitating because u felt uncomfortable settling my own boundaries and things haven't been very much easier lately.
But I was pushed to the meeting and it actually turned out pretty good. We were talking about having separated relationships as most important, but also talked about group activities to do together and made out a timeregulation that would be fair for us all. She eventually said that it would be okay if I didn't want to meet with her and even if I said that later or changed my mind midway. We get a synchronised calendar were we settle all of our dates and make a group chat to talk about switching days etc.
So the week regulation came. He is one week with me one week with her and has two days of each of this weeks for himself.
In her nightshifts we often texted, me telling her all about my life so she'd get to know me, about some of my trauma of friendships or bad and good experiences of my life. Now, eventually I realised I was only just telling her stuff and she just like nodded but I don't know even the slightest thing about her life... the convos were very one-sided I felt, so I slowly stopped texting her. But I always kept replying and talking to her, I just didn't start convos anymore. And I am absolutely bad at group chats, I play dead most of the time there, so the texts in the group chat eventually fews down as well.
Three weeks in the time regulation I come to realise that every one of my weekends, except for one, is blocked with events they planed together. I talk to him about it (actually we had an argument about it) He realises it, gives me his days for every weekend day of mine he spends with her. I still thought that was unfair since that ment we won't have a free day for up to 4 months, but I know my bf is a people pleaser and really often rather turnes his own favors down for the sake of peace, and that she has a very time consuming job with very few weekends off so I though t I'd be like that. But I think I should add to that that when I needed a day from her discussions came across what days she could have in exchange.
We planned on a regular friendgroup coming together but after all my free weekends were off the rails I didn't want to plan more of my time for it since all dates for that came up in my time as well. She asked for two events she would like to go with both of us but I turned it down because they were falling on the only free weekend left for me in those months.
My bf and I had a talk about all this and he told me then that he lately had to shut her down because she was trying to suggest or plan activities just for me and him to attend, and he himself didn't feel good with doing only things with me that she came up with.
A few weeks later she texted me asking if there was something wrong because she felt some distance between us both and she wanted to know if there was a problem or if I just changed my mind on dealing with her.
I told her all the problems I had the last few months explicitly the thing with the appointments on my weekends. Her answer: ""I'm so sorry I didn't realise it but I was also jealous, thinking you both get enough free time and I didn't, but actually it is his responsibility all along""
And he thought the same way after that talk.
We talked it out and she apologised , offered a solution and the smoke lifted. Still, I told her that in my state of mind I thought it would be better if I distance myself from her and that I hope and try that it'll eventually get better with time. She was okay with that.
A week later she gifted me something for my birthday, which was two months ago, and I wrote her a thank you text, telling her that I will still keep distance. It was okay with her.
Half a week later she and him had a huge fight because I was ""neglecting and ignoring her""

Now, he was mad as me as well claiming that she is mad at me now and I am constantly mad at her and he will separate us now for good. He said a few things that stuck with me, like he said I was claiming she was trying so sabotage our relationship, what I never said or thought (up to this point). I have a problem with Paranoia and when it came up I talked to him but explicitly not with the intention to blame her for it that I had bad experiences in the past. He also said that he wouldn't have such problems with her other partners. But he previously told me that they have different agreements and rules and I think that we have ours and they weren't respecting them and that is a problem regardless what she does with her other partners. And I know that he doesn't involve himself as much as she did with me. I feel like her relationships are just her business but his relationship need to be her business, too. And I feel like he's not seeing it.
He apologised to me big time after the fight and told me that the whole thing was her fault and she needs to get herself together, projected feelings, depression, adhd, all those problems I have as well and I get and understand that. She texted me after this fight and told me that she would like to cut contact for me. I am so confused I said that a week prior and that would have done the deed but there had to be a fight for some reason and I had to get dragged into it?
I mean, at that point, I came to realise that she didn't know about my problems because she asked me so he obviously didn't tell her about my problems with the whole weekend thing. I didn't mind, but I didn't think it was only just his responsibility to keep the time schedule in line. I pay attention when I settle appointments that I don't set them in her time when he is not there because I know if I told him he'd make it work but that's what we got that schedule for and I think it's just wrong to hide behind his responsibility. We all have the calendar and we can all see each others time.
I stopped using the calendar recently because I saw that they have another separated one. He told me he has that for events that are just thier business, so why would I share everything with both of them if they can't share everything with me I am so confused
I don't want to say anything bad about her but all my previous life experiences and gut feelings tell me to run from her, and that she is a red flag. And that's so sad because my actual bf is all-round a wonderful and lovely guy. I mean he has his own demons like all of us but he is trying so hard and doing so well and he pays so much attention. Except for everything from the above. Most of that we handled and we somewhat talked it out, but I feel like the only arguments we had were about those above things, and we get along so well and so much better than with anyone else I am so damn confused
It feels like she used him to test my borders and when she couldn't get past them, she blew. But I may be overthinking, I just now that right now I am holding kind of a grudge. I hope it will pass

I don't know why I am writing that and thanks for everyone who is still listening.
I don't feel like breaking up. But I sometimes think about it... but I wouldn't do it because of him, I just can't stop wondering if that's just the poly mess or if I am the problem or mixing something up...
If someone gets together a tldr please script it I don't know how to narrow all of that down. Also sorry for writing mistakes I am not native english

On the day I was supposed to get my marriage license, I found myself at city hall bright and early, waiting from 8 AM until it closed.

Just as I was walking out, feeling the curious stares from the crowd, I got a message from Austin Herrera, saying something had come up at work, and we'd need to [reschedule.ac](http://reschedule.ac)

When I got back to our empty house, I opened my phone and saw an Instagram post from Austin's childhood sweetheart: \[Thanks for the birthday gift, Austin.\]

The photo showed a beautiful scene on an island, and in the corner, I could still see a guy with a well-defined physique.

Scrolling through the comments, it was all compliments and a bit of playful envy about having such a great friend.

After giving the post a like, I decided to reach out to my friend. \[Hey, can you set up that blind date you mentioned last time?\]

\*\*\*\*\*

I'd been in love with Austin for six years, and during that time, I'd transformed from a young girl into a woman nearly thirty.

My family had been all about the wedding talk, and I kept bringing up marriage with Austin, but he always seemed to put it off.

Just when I thought I might be done waiting, he surprised me by proposing in public not too long ago.

Today was supposed to be the big day for us to get our license.

Two days ago, my mom called out of the blue, saying, ""Sweetie, I consulted someone, and they say the day after tomorrow is a perfect day for you to get your license.""

I couldn't help but laugh, and of course, Austin heard me. He pulled me into a warm embrace and assured me he was all in for anything I needed.

But then, right before our license appointment yesterday, he suddenly started packing his bags for a business trip. Before he left, he gently ruffled my hair and said, ""Don't worry, it's just for a day. I'll definitely be back in time.""

Looking into his calm eyes, I held back the words I wanted to say. I just smiled as I dropped him off at the airport, feeling happy. Even last night when we talked, he swore he was already at the airport.

Today, I woke up early, put on some light makeup, and headed to the city hall with my driver's license in hand. I couldn't help but daydream about the amazing life we'd have together.

As time ticked by, the fresh rose in my hand slowly wilted. I called Austin multiple times, but none of my calls went through, and I couldn't shake the worry that something might have happened to him.

I even reached out to a coworker who was supposed to be traveling with him, trying to get some intel. Turns out, they hadn't been on any trip at all.

""Ms. Parks, I heard Mr. Herrera took a week off just to get ready for the wedding. I'd be thrilled to attend your wedding,"" the guy said.

""I'll see you then,"" I replied, chuckling weakly before hanging up.

I still found myself wondering if this whole thing was some sort of surprise that Austin was planning for me.

When I finally got home, the place was empty, and as I flipped the lights on, I realized there wasn't going to be any surprise waiting for me after all.

Feeling a bit let down, I collapsed on the couch and tried to clear my mind about what Austin was actually up to.

Just then, I got a message from Austin: \[The company had a temporary issue. We'd have to get the license some other time.\]

I replied with a simple \[Sure.\]

Then, out of curiosity, I opened Instagram and found a post from Austin's childhood sweetheart. \[Thanks for the birthday gift, Austin.\] It was accompanied by a photo of an island.

There was a girl in a cute swimsuit lounging under a coconut tree, donning a wide sun hat and carrying a limited edition bag. And in the reflections of her sunglasses was a solidly-built guy snapping a pic of her.

Yeah, that was definitely Austin off on a supposedly ""temporary"" commitment.

Scrolling through the comments, I saw others lamenting how they wished they had a brother like him.

I couldn't help but chuckle. Honestly, I felt pretty foolish. Just earlier, I was all worried about him, and now here I was, making excuses for his obvious lies.

I was so hopelessly dumb.

A dull ache settled in my chest. I'd been in love with Austin for six long years, and those sweet moments we shared were often tainted by things that didn't really belong to us.

There was his childhood sweetheart, Rosemary Read. Her parents had passed away when she was young, and she ended up being raised in Austin's home, which made them incredibly close, almost like siblings.

On my birthday, I'd find myself blowing out candles alone while he'd get wrapped up in some excuse related to Rosemary. He'd even bring her along on our dates, saying he couldn't leave her alone at home.

And when he finally proposed, he bought her a dress from the same collection he picked for me because, apparently, she liked it too.

All those memories flooded back, and every argument we had over Rosemary ended with that same phrase from him. ""She's just my little sister.""

My heart sank a little deeper, especially knowing he was off vacationing on some island with Rosemary while I sat at home waiting for him.

Six years. How many more of these could I take? Growing up without a father, I always wanted a complete family, dreaming that my future kids would have a happy home.

I smiled bitterly, wiping away the tears that had slipped out.

I even liked this post, hoping he'd take a hint. Then, I turned around and casually messaged a friend: \[Hey, can you set up that blind date you mentioned last time?\]

\*\*\*\*\*

Austin returned home three days later. He walked in with an icy chill hanging around him and stood in the foyer, waiting for me to come help with the bags.

I stayed put on the couch, not giving him a glance.

When I didn't move, he finally spoke up, ""Laurel, I'm home."" I just hummed and kept my eyes glued to the TV.

Noticing something was off, he hung his snow-drenched jacket by the door and made his way over to me. He wrapped me in his arms and softly asked if I was upset.

""Laurel, I'm sorry. That project was a bit tricky,"" he said.

I tuned into his steady heartbeat, which didn't skip a beat even when he lied.

""I saw Rosemary's Instagram,"" I shot back, locking my gaze on him to see how he'd react.

When I dropped Rosemary's name, I could see his face tighten with annoyance, and I could hear it in his voice. ""Rosemary just happened to be there, and I swung by for her birthday. How many times do I have to tell you I think of her like a little sister?""

Just like I thought, he was sticking to the same old script. ""Oh, so you had time for her birthday but no time to give me a call?"" I asked.

During the time I couldn't reach him, my mind raced, wondering if he was safe. I felt a lump in my throat as I fought to hold back tears in front of him.

Austin pressed his lips together and stubbornly added, ""What difference does it make? We still couldn't get a license anyway.""

I looked at him, the guy I'd spent six years with, and felt a wave of disappointment wash over me. For a moment, I didn't even want to argue.

Just then, the doorbell rang. I got up to answer it, and it was Rosemary. She had a big bag in her hand and smiled warmly at me. ""Laurel, you're here. I brought Austin's stuff he left at my place.""

She handed me the bag, revealing a bracelet around her wrist.

My heart dropped when I saw it, and I froze as I took the bag in my hands. That bracelet was special. Austin had traveled to several cities to get it for me.

When he gave it to me, he said, ""I hope this brings you luck.""

Turns out, what I thought was something unique between us, he had given to Rosemary too.

""Sorry, Laurel,"" Rosemary said, her hands together and her head tilted, her eyes wide with innocence.

# Chapter 2 Break Up

""You're not upset that Austin took me on vacation for my birthday, are you?"" Rosemary asked.

I looked at her, not saying a word, and quietly closed the door behind me.

\*\*\*\*\*

I went cold turkey with Austin. Every time we fought about Rosemary, it would spark a silent war. Austin had gotten used to this pattern, knowing that after three days, I'd be back in front of him, ready to make up.

I hadn't even drifted off to sleep when there was a loud knock at my door.

""Laurel!"" Austin shouted, his voice filled with frustration.

I opened the door, and he shoved his phone at me. ""How many times do I have to say it? Rosemary is just my sister! Why do you take it so personally?""

I was clueless. ""What did I do to her?""

""And you have the nerve to ask! Did you say something to her when she came over? Mom said she's been off since she got back, and now she's in the hospital because of her depression!""

I glanced at Austin's phone, the screen showing a picture of Rosemary lying weakly in a hospital bed, her wrist wrapped in thick gauze.

""I didn't say anything to her,"" I said. I was being honest.

Austin said to me sharply with one hand around my neck, ""If anything goes wrong with Rosemary, you can forget about marrying me.""

I wanted to call him a psycho, but I couldn't get half a sound out of my throat, and I frantically scratched at Austin's hand, desperate for him to let me go.

Just when I felt like I might pass out, he threw me to the ground and looked down at me, condescendingly saying, ""After everything we've been through, if you don't go after Rosemary again, I might actually think about marrying you.""

With that, he turned and stormed downstairs, snatching the keys from the table before slamming the door behind him.

I was left sitting on the floor, struggling to catch my breath. It felt like my heart was completely shattered. He made these wild accusations without a shred of proof, and it was like he was losing it over it all.

I wobbled a bit as I pushed myself up, steadying myself against the wall, and grabbed the phone that had been ringing off the hook on the nightstand.

""Laurel, it's been ages! Want to grab a drink?"" It was Erin George, my high school classmate, someone I hadn't seen in years.

She had just landed in Newton City and was only around for a day before she headed back.

Taking a deep breath to steady my nerves, I agreed to meet her.

\*\*\*\*\*

Erin had reserved a fancy dining room and invited a few of our close friends from the area. The vibe was chill as we all caught up, sharing stories from our lives while reminiscing about the good old times.

""So, Laurel, how are things with you and Austin? Still not married?"" Erin shot me a teasing look.

Back in the day, everyone figured Austin and I would end up together since we were high school sweethearts who went to the same college.

I tugged at the collar of my turtleneck sweater, avoiding eye contact as I swirled the wine in my glass before downing it. ""Nope. Guess it just wasn't meant to be.""

Polly Maxwell frowned, leaning in. ""Is it you or him who doesn't want it anymore?""

""It's him,"" I replied, feeling the weight of those words.

Suddenly, Polly slammed her hand on the table hard enough to send her fork clattering to the ground. ""Is it because of Rosemary? I warned you ages ago that she'd always be in the way between you two, but you wouldn't listen!""

I couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh and shake my head. I always thought Austin just liked pampering his ""sister.""

""Rosemary?"" Laura Watson chimed in, pulling out her phone to show us something.

She played a video that caught everyone's attention: there was Rosemary, wildly banging on a middle-aged guy with her heel. The man held her wrists firmly and was telling bystanders, ""My wife is just having a tantrum, so don't mind her.""

With tears in her eyes, Rosemary was begging, ""No, please help me!""

The video ended with a tall guy standing up to confront the burly man, announcing that the police were on their way. Just before he left, the burly guy leaned in to whisper something threatening to Rosemary.

""It went viral in my neighborhood‚Äîeveryone was saying the guy was a psychopath and warned to be careful when going out."" Laura looked at me, her eyes filled with pity. ""It looked like Rosemary.""

""It's her,"" I said calmly, unable to shake the unsettling feeling.

The woman in the video looked just like Rosemary, from her hair to the outfit she wore.

Austin had vaguely mentioned that Rosemary had been molested as a child, leaving her with deep psychological scars. I couldn't help but think the psycho had something to do with her suicide.

""Quit bringing her up. I told you Austin's no good for you. When the hell are you finally gonna dump him?"" Polly, a bit tipsy, shot me a disapproving look, like she was ready to jump on me if I said I still had feelings for Austin.

Outside, the rain drizzled against the window, and I noticed a dull ache from the bruise on my neck.

I stared at the raindrops sliding down the glass, feeling a bit lost. ""Just a couple more days.""

\*\*\*\*\*

A week later, Austin got in touch again. The whole Rosemary situation had somehow made the news, and I followed it reluctantly.

The report said the man was in a psychiatric hospital, and the girl who was involved was under close protection by her family.

I knew Austin was aware of the truth. When he called, instead of apologizing, he casually informed me he'd be home for dinner tonight. I shrugged it off, ""Anything else?""

The agent waited patiently for me to sign the contract, and I double-checked everything before putting my name down. Austin was quiet for a while, then finally said, ""Laurel, about the other day, I...""

I kept silent, waiting for him to continue. In the end, I didn't get the apology I expected. Instead, he blurted out, ""Let's get married, Laurel. I'll meet you at the city hall tomorrow.""

I couldn't help but smile ironically, feeling an unusual heaviness in my heart.

Had I been so indulgent with him over the years that I'd given him the impression this was how to make it up to me? Did he really think I was that easy to brush aside?

""No, thanks,"" I replied.

His displeasure was clear. ""What do you mean, no?""

I strolled over to the window to take in the view of Newton City, a place I'd been stuck in for what felt like ages. I moved here for Austin since his whole family was based in this city.

I saved up every penny to buy this house, hoping that one day, if I got married, my mom would come to live here with me. It'd make it easier to care for her.

But honestly, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being pretty selfish, making her move to a strange city just for me. Right now, though, I'd never felt more sober.

""I mean, we're done,"" I said.

Austin was about to say more when I heard Rosemary's voice blaring on the other end. ""Austin, where are you?""

He left me a quick, irritated ""Cut it out"" and hung up.

The agent beside me pretended not to notice the commotion and flashed a smile, saying, ""Ms. Parks, the funds will arrive within 24 hours.""

I nodded and handed him the key. ""Thanks. Here you go.""

# Chapter 3 Choices

After selling the house, I drove back to the place I shared with Austin and opened the door to an eerie stillness.

It seemed Austin hadn't been around for a while‚Äîhe'd been busy taking care of Rosemary at the hospital.

I couldn't help but smirk a little. Honestly, that was fine by me. I'd rather not run into him.

Most of my stuff was in the second bedroom, and over the years, I'd had my fair share of arguments with Austin about Rosemary.

I had spent my time in that room during the rough patches and felt like I was constantly keeping my head down.

A bitter smile crept across my face as I packed up my things, remembering how submissive I used to be.

I didn't bother keeping anything that reminded me of Austin. Two hours later, I wiped the beads of sweat off my forehead with a tissue, feeling a mix of exhaustion and relief.

Then, my phone rang. I glanced at the caller ID and saw it was my mom. I hesitated for a second before answering. ""Hey, Mom.""

Her voice was filled with that familiar mix of excitement and nostalgia. ""Laurel, how's it going? Have you gotten the license yet? Have you and Austin talked about the wedding plans?""

I felt something tighten in my throat as I opened my mouth, but nothing came out.

There was a long, awkward silence, and when my mom began to press me, I took a deep breath, fighting back tears. ""Mom, I'm not getting married.""

""What do you mean, Laurel? What's going on?"" Her tone turned anxious.

I tried to explain, ""I just don't think Austin and I are right for each other.""

Her voice rose slightly. ""But Laurel, you've been together forever! Why say this now, right before the wedding? Come on, you're 27, not a kid anymore.""

It struck me that without even asking what I was feeling, she just urged me to get married.

Tears filled my eyes, and I had to cover my mouth to keep from breaking down. After what felt like forever, I found my voice, ""Mom, I really just don't want to marry him.""

My mom didn't hold back her frustration. ""So what do you want, then? Just give up on all these years?""

When she heard my firm answer, her tone shifted. ""Laurel, how can you just say you don't want this after all this time?""

""Well, I just said it,"" I shot back, feeling overwhelmed.

My mom's voice suddenly went all high-pitched, probably still trying to convince me, and before she could make a sound, I heard a dull thud from the other end of the line.

""Mom?"" I called out but got no response.

A wave of panic hit me like a freight train. ""Mom! What's wrong? Please answer me!""

All I could make out was a faint moan of pain coming from her. My heart clenched tight, and I hung up in a hurry, flipping on the home security feed.

In my panic, my phone slipped from my shaking hands, sliding under the couch like it was covered in grease.

I dropped to my knees, desperately reaching for my phone. The security footage showed my mom, clearly in distress, clutching her chest and reaching for her medicine on the table.

All I wanted to do was dive through the screen and hand her the pills she needed.

I had only one thought racing through my mind: save my mom. I quickly opened my contacts and dialed my aunt, Bonnie Porter, who lived in the same building with my mom.

""Come on, pick up!"" I pleaded, praying she'd answer fast.

The ten seconds felt like an eternity, but finally, Bonnie picked up. I burst into tears, sounding like a total mess as I exclaimed, ""Aunt Bonnie, my mom is having an attack! You need to hurry!""

Bonnie sounded surprised but jumped into action, heading over to my mom's place while trying to calm me down.

I hung up and immediately called for an ambulance, anxiously switching back to the feed, just hoping someone would get to my mom in time.

At that moment, I regretted everything about moving to Newton City alone and leaving my mom all by herself. Watching her suffer through a screen felt like a nightmare.

I couldn't help but blame myself for being so hasty in talking to her and pushing her buttons.

The self-loathing and regret were overwhelming. I shouldn't have done that. I was so wrong. I promised myself, never again.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity of two minutes, I heard the doorbell chime, signaling that Bonnie had entered the house.

She rushed in, looking almost like an angel descending from above, and quickly administered the medicine from the table to my mom.

Through the monitor, I watched as my mom's pale expression started to ease up while my phone slipped weakly to the floor.

Bonnie called me to let me know that my mom was out of danger, and I insisted she take her to the hospital for a follow-up.

It wasn't until I hung up that I felt like I'd regained my sanity, and my heart, which was racing like crazy, finally calmed down.

Taking a deep breath, I picked up the pace with my packing. The thought of leaving Newton City was getting harder to shake off.

The moving guys were still on their way, so I was waiting and checking in with Bonnie about my mom's condition when, out of nowhere, Austin appeared right in front of me.

The sound of the bouquet hitting the floor snapped me out of my phone trance, and I was taken aback by his sudden presence.

He was all dressed up in a sharp suit and tie, with his hair styled just right, showing off a smooth forehead that gave him a touch of mature charm. A bunch of delicate roses lay discarded at his feet.

His eyes looked stormy, filled with suppressed anger as he gritted out, ""Laurel, what do you mean by that?""

""Didn't I tell you? I want to break up. Do you not get it?"" My emotions were all over the place, and I was starting to lose my patience, saying whatever popped into my head.

He kicked the coffee table in frustration, sending glass flying, and pointed at the photo I had tossed in the trash, shouting angrily, ""I'm going to get a marriage license with you today. What do you mean?""

So that was why he dressed up‚Äîhe thought we were heading to get a license. I assumed he dressed to the nine to pick up Rosemary from the hospital.

""I don't need that‚Äî"" I tried to shoot back.

Before I could finish, he cut me off, ""Didn't I promise to marry you? What do you want? Are you done with your little tantrum? If you don't marry me, what are you going to say to your mom?""

Looking at his smug face, I couldn't help but think he knew how much my mom had been looking forward to my wedding for ages.

So he knew all the time. He kept me waiting for three long years before finally agreeing to marry me, fully aware of my mom's situation.

It was just heartbreaking. What was I even doing falling for him?

I found myself staring at Austin in silence, my eyes reflecting a deep emptiness.

His anger started to fade as he seemed to regain some composure, and he began to softly coax me, ""I was wrong to stand you up, Laurel. Can we move past this?""

My resolve started to waver, but not because of him‚Äîit was all about my mom. I really worried that she would get so upset over everything that it would send her into another health scare.

She'd been adamant about me starting a family, and she'd definitely prefer Austin, the guy I've been in love with for years, over some blind date she barely knew.

That bruise on my neck was a constant reminder that I shouldn't just give in. But my mom was still stuck in that hospital bed, and it stopped me cold.

Just as I was about to crack, something unexpected happened that helped me decide what to do.

# Chapter 4 Just A Bad Dream

At that moment, a figure suddenly appeared, and I was taken aback to see Rosemary standing right in front of me.

She looked drained and pale, wearing a white dress that did nothing to hide her distress.

""Laurel, are you mad at Austin?"" Rosemary's eyes were glossy with unshed tears, and there was a mix of fear and helplessness in her expression.

She continued, her voice cracking, ""It's all my fault. I didn't clarify things with Austin, and that's what led to the misunderstanding between you two.""

I remained silent, my gaze fixed on Rosemary.

""Please, don't be angry with him. I'm truly sorry,"" she pleaded, clearly overwhelmed. ""Austin has been planning for ages to get a marriage license with you."" She bit her lip, looking extremely weak.

I was about to reply when Austin, whose face was dark with frustration, said, ""Laurel, enough already. Rosemary came here to apologize‚Äîwhat more do you want from her?""

I noticed the bruise on her wrist, wrapped in cloth, and shifted my attention to Austin, ""Austin, how about you make a choice? You can either have me or Rosemary.""

""That's enough, Laurel!"" he snapped, glaring at me as though he could burn a hole right through me.

The answer had been clear for a while, but here I was, still holding on. Not for him, but for myself. Six years. How did I lose myself in all this and end up loving a guy like him? I had no idea.

I looked at Austin, trying to keep my cool, and gave a faint smile. ""So, if I go celebrate another guy's birthday, hang around when he's sick, and baby him every now and then, does that make me just some shameless woman in your eyes?""

""Laurel, Austin and I are not what you think,"" Rosemary mumbled, her surprise evident.

""Come on, Rosemary. You know Austin and I are getting married, so why do you keep showing up looking all innocent? You're playing the role of the 'good girl' pretty well,"" I shot back.

With those words, Rosemary froze, disbelief written all over her face, and then she burst into tears.

Pop! Austin's brow furrowed in anger as he stared at me, who had been slapped to the ground by him.

""Laurel,"" Rosemary's reaction was immediate as she rushed to help me.

But I caught a glimpse of a smirk creeping onto her lips just before she lowered her gaze. It was quick but telling.

""Fuck off!"" The words flew out before I could stop myself, and Rosemary stumbled back a couple of steps.

""Laurel,"" Austin said, his eyes heavy with disappointment. ""You've turned into a green-eyed monster. Rosemary was just trying to help you, and you went and pushed her away?""

Rosemary started tugging on his arm, stammering, ""Austin, I'm fine. It's my fault. I made Laurel mad.""

I finally managed to stand and let out a soft laugh. ""What a twist! Did I even touch you, Rosemary? No matter what happens, suddenly it's my fault? Am I like some kind of biochemical weapon just for you?""

Rosemary looked stunned, lost for words, but then tears started streaming down her face as if they were on a mission.

""Laurel, I want you to apologize to Rosemary! Or else I'm not getting married,"" Austin demanded, furrowing his brow. He seemed totally unfazed by the breakup talk.

Sure, I usually brought up breakups during our fights, but in the end, all it took was a little coaxing from him, and I'd be back on his side, pretending nothing had ever gone wrong.

I didn't want to dwell on these arguments to protect our feelings.

But suddenly it hit me: what Austin and I had was just me fooling myself, constantly backing down and giving in.

""Austin, we're done. I'm the one who called it off. You both handle it from here,"" I said, wanting nothing more than to walk away from the mess and that scum for good.

With that, I grabbed my suitcase and headed for the door, not looking back. Rosemary was still trying to reason with Austin. ""Austin, you should go after Laurel. This is all my fault,"" she pleaded.

""Relax, she's just having a little meltdown. She won't really break up with me,"" Austin assured her.

Once I settled into the cab, I noticed the two of them on the security camera, wrapped up in each other's arms, and I couldn't help but smirk a little. They claimed there was nothing between them, but deep down, I knew the truth.

I raised a hand to my cheek, still tender from Austin's earlier blow, and it felt like a knife twisted in my heart. The ache spread through my body, a reminder of the six years I'd wasted.

I wasn't crying, but my heart felt so heavy it was hard to breathe.

After a moment of reflection, I pulled up the video I had just recorded and posted it on my Instagram.

Since I decided to cut ties with Austin, I figured it was only fitting to finish what they started. I wasn't going to take this slap for nothing.

I crafted my last message: \[A shoutout to those who'd supported me over the past six years. I am officially breaking up with Austin.\]

With a final click, I powered off my phone. Clutching an ice pack over my throbbing head, I glanced at the city disappearing beneath me.

There was a mix of humiliation and anger in my heart, but seeing the bright blue sky somehow lightened the burden a bit.

Before I knew it, I drifted off to sleep, only to wake up with tears streaming down my face. Just then, a long, elegant hand offered me a gray handkerchief.

""Here,"" the owner of the pretty hand said, his voice smooth and calming.

""Thanks,"" I mumbled, taking it awkwardly.

""Are you alright?"" he asked, a note of concern in his tone.

I nodded, forcing a bittersweet smile. ""I'm fine, just a bad dream.""

I dreamt back to the first time I laid eyes on Austin, my heart racing‚Äîit was definitely one of those love-at-first-sight moments.

Later on, I even went so far as to lower my standards just to get into the same school as him. I thought it would lead to a better life, but honestly, I was just squandering my best years.

It was interesting how sometimes the wrong person could feel scarier than facing a real demon.

I let out a deep sigh and turned to glance at the guy sitting next to me. Just one look, and my whole body froze.

My heart raced as I managed to stammer, ""Un-uncle Alex, what are you doing here?""

Alex Herrera raised an eyebrow, sizing me up before casually saying, ""Didn't you break up with Austin? Why do you still call me uncle?""

# Chapter 5 An Awkward Encounter

I took a deep breath when I unexpectedly ran into Alex on the plane. How did I end up meeting him here? He was Austin's uncle and Raphael Herrera's youngest son.

In the Herrera family, he was the one everyone feared‚Äîespecially Austin.

Growing up, Alex was molded to be someone else entirely. When I first heard his name, I pictured a woman, but instead, I found this incredibly handsome guy‚Äîmore stunning than most women I know.

Not only did he have looks, but he had also got this air of sophistication about him. At a young age, he was already seated as the president of Herrera Group.

Though he was only six years older than Austin, Austin had to call him uncle, and I was dating Austin, so I'd been doing the same.

But now that Austin and I were officially done, it felt silly to still call him that.

""Did you and Austin have a fallout?"" Alex asked, his voice lowered as he crossed his legs, a knowing smile on his face.

""No, it's a breakup,"" I said, trying to sound confident.

""A breakup?"" He looked surprised, still smiling, but I could tell he didn't buy it.

I mean, who could blame him? Being married to Austin, a rich young man from the Herrera family, seemed like a dream for most women.

Besides, after six years together, how could I possibly just walk away from that? Back then, I was all-in on Austin.

Everyone thought I was just lucky to be with him, and honestly, if he'd revealed his true identity back in school, I might not have been his pick in the first place.

Now, I was nearing thirty with nothing to show for it‚Äîwho was I to break up with him? Even Austin assumed I was head over heels for him and that suggesting a breakup was just me throwing a fit.

""Yeah,"" I said, taking a deep breath to steady myself, trying my best to keep it cool.

""I saw your Instagram."" Alex looked up slowly, his voice still calm and soft.

It felt like the way an elder talked to a younger person, but the light in his eyes‚Äîslightly reminiscent of Austin's‚Äîhit me with a mix of panic and awe.

I honestly hadn't expected Alex to keep tabs on my Instagram, and I'd even forgotten he had an account. He rarely said much online, just a few holiday photos now and then. I seriously wondered if he even used it himself.

""As long as you've thought it through,"" he added.

I was taken aback for a second, waiting for Alex to drop some words of shame or caution about being impulsive. Instead, he surprised me with his response.

The tension in my chest vanished instantly as I managed a shy smile and nodded silently.

I didn't breathe a sigh of relief until the plane touched down and I watched Alex stand up and grab his luggage.

Although he wasn't as intimidating as I had imagined, he still had this unshakeable aura that felt heavy.

As I stepped out of the airport, a black Alphard suddenly pulled up right in front of me.

Before I could process it, the driver came over and said, ""Ms. Parks, Mr. Herrera asked me to give you a ride.""

I opened my mouth to decline, but when the window rolled down and I saw that gorgeous face, words just vanished.

At that moment, it hit me‚ÄîAustin's fear of Alex was totally justified. The guy had such a strong presence that I felt too timid to say no.

""Get in the car. It's going to rain soon,"" Alex said, glancing at me with that cool gaze.

I found myself sliding into the car without a second thought. Sitting beside him, I quickly masked my emotions. My face was calm, but inside, I felt this strange unease.

After all, I had just broken up with Austin. Why would Alex bother giving me a ride? Was it just because of the rain? Or maybe he felt sorry for me?

Trying to figure it out was a lost cause, especially since Alex and I had only crossed paths a few times.

It was not like a guy like him would focus on someone like me. Maybe it was just pity, some kindness for someone who had just got out of a serious relationship. Honestly, I decided not to overthink it.

""Where to?"" Alex's calm voice pulled me out of my thoughts.

""The hospital,"" I replied almost automatically, without thinking twice.

Honestly, I felt a bit awkward saying that, but I was already thankful that I kept my home address under wraps.

All of a sudden, it started pouring rain. It didn't even register with me that it was actually raining.

Half an hour later, we pulled up outside the hospital. The driver got out, grabbed my luggage from the trunk, and strolled over with an umbrella in hand.

As I stepped out, I glanced back at Alex, who was sitting in the car with his eyes half-closed. I swallowed my thanks and left.

Taking my suitcase and turning my back to the sleek black car, I finally let out a long sigh of relief.

In my mind, I couldn't shake the image of Alex's striking profile. He was clearly in his early thirties but carried an air of maturity that made him seem older.

It was a shame, too, because, with a face like that, Alex would probably attract a lot of young admirers.

As I walked into the hospital and fished out my phone, a call came in from an unknown number. After a brief moment of hesitation, I hit the answer button.

""Laurel, what the heck is wrong with you? Do you even realize that Rosemary is sick because of you?"" It was Amanda Herrera, Austin's mother, and her angry voice echoed through the line.

I stood there for a second, stunned, gripping my suitcase tightly.

""Laurel, you need to come back right now and apologize to Rosemary. Clear things up online and say you posted that video by accident. We'll let this slide!"" Amanda demanded.

I instinctively ran my fingers over my throat, which still felt a bit sore.

I was relieved that I hadn't gone through with getting a license with Austin.

Honestly, I was grateful for the last three years of not marrying him. It took me a while to truly see how ridiculous I was being.

Looking back on the past six years, it felt like I'd thrown a piece of my heart to the wolves.

I looked at her and said, ""Mrs. Herrera, Austin and I are through. So, do me a favor and don't bother me again.""

""Laurel, enough already! You're really crossing the line here. My mom called you‚Äîso what the hell do you want from me?"" Austin's voice came through, sharp and frustrated.",1,1748687094.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
