Brothers and sisters,

You're not weak.

If you failed before, it wasn't willpower. If you're on Day 10 right now - you should be proud. You beat something hard.

But nobody told you what's coming next. And that's not fair to you.

Let me break it down.

## What You'll Learn Here:

1. **The Two Phases** - Why most people survive Week 2 but die in Month 3
2. **Why You Can't Beat Biology** - Your brain is hardwired against you
3. **The 8% Who Succeed** - What they have that you don't
4. **The Data** - Cold hard numbers on success rates
5. **Proof From This Subreddit** - Where did everyone go?
6. **A Different Approach** - There might be a better way

---

## The Two Phases

**Phase 1: Physical Withdrawal (Weeks 1-3)**
- Nicotine leaves your body
- Receptors normalize in ~21 days
- This is what everyone talks about
- This is what patches and gum are designed for
- **Most people make it through this phase**

If you're on Day 10, you're winning Phase 1.

---

**Phase 2: Neural Pathway Hell (Months 2-6)**
- Your brain built cigarette pathways over years
- Coffee → cigarette. Stress → cigarette. After meals → cigarette.
- These pathways SCREAM for completion 10-30x per day
- **Science shows they need 3-6 MONTHS to weaken**
- You removed your coping mechanism in Week 2
- Now you survive MONTHS of this with willpower alone
- **This is where 80-85% fail**

This is the real enemy. And almost nobody warned you about it.

---

## Why You Can't Beat Biology With Willpower

Here's what nobody tells you: **You're not fighting an addiction. You're fighting biology. And biology always wins.**

**Problem 1: You removed your anti-stress mechanism while life continues**
- Job stress doesn't stop
- Relationship problems don't pause
- Financial pressure keeps coming
- You're facing the same life... with no coping tool
- **Your body doesn't care about your motivation. It needs a solution for stress.**

**Problem 2: Your brain thinks it's SERIOUSLY SICK**
- Cigarettes gave 10x dopamine hits, multiple times per day, for YEARS
- Now those hits are gone
- Your brain's alarm system triggers: ""SOMETHING IS WRONG""
- This isn't a small craving - your brain thinks you're in danger
- It will scream at you 10-30 times per day for MONTHS
- **This is hardwired survival circuitry. You can't willpower your way through survival instincts.**

**This is why 92% of us lose. Not weakness. Biology.**

You're trying to fight 3-6 months of biological alarm signals with pure mental strength. That's like trying to hold your breath for an hour through willpower alone.

**It. Doesn't. Work.**

---

## Need Proof? Look Around This Subreddit Right Now

Search for posts about withdrawal symptoms, anxiety, stress, cravings.

**How many are from Day 3? Day 7? Day 10?**

Now search for **Day 30. Day 45. Day 60.**

**People are still suffering MONTHS later.** Still posting about:
- ""Day 40 and still getting intense cravings""
- ""Week 8 and anxiety is worse than ever""
- ""2 months in and I'm struggling more than Week 1""
- ""Day 50 - when does this get easier?""

**These people survived Phase 1. They beat physical withdrawal.**

**But Phase 2 is destroying them. And they don't even know that's what it is.**

They think something is wrong with THEM. They think they're failing. They think they're weak.

**No. Their biology is screaming. And nobody told them it would last 3-6 MONTHS.**

---

## The 8% Who Succeed? They're Not Superhumans

Here's the truth about the people who make it with pure willpower:

They usually have:
- Strong social support (family/friends actively helping)
- Economic stability (low external stress)
- Professional stability (not job hunting, no work crisis)
- Or they got lucky with timing (life was calm during months 2-4)

**Translation: Their biology got less resistance.**

**If you're fighting this alone, stressed, with normal life problems?**

**Your odds drop to 3-5%.**

That's not a willpower problem, friend. **That's a biology problem.**

---

## The Data

**6-month success rates:**
- Cold turkey: 3-5%
- Patches/gum: 8-10%
- Prescription meds: 15-20%

**Average: 8-12% success**

**That means 88-92% of you will relapse within 6 months.**

Not because you're weak. Because current methods ignore Phase 2 biology.

**They're asking you to fight 3-6 months of neural screaming with willpower. That's not a method. That's torture.**

---

## This Subreddit Proves It

Look around this community:

- Hundreds of Day 10, Day 14, Day 21 posts
- Almost no Day 60, Day 90, Day 120 posts
- 200K members

**Where did everyone go?**

They made it through Phase 1 (physical withdrawal). Then biology killed them in Phase 2. The phase nobody prepared them for.

**The math proves it:** If most people reach Day 14-21 (lots of posts), but only 8-12% make it to Month 6, then **80-85% are failing BETWEEN Week 3 and Month 6.** That's Phase 2 biology winning.

---

## The Hard Truth

**You cannot beat biology with willpower.**

Your brain needs 3-6 months to rewire. Current methods give you 2-3 weeks of support, then say ""good luck"" for the remaining 5 months of biological warfare.

That's not a fair fight. That's why you keep losing.

**And it's not your fault.**

---

## Disclaimer

I'm not a doctor or researcher. I've never smoked myself. This is information compiled from addiction neuroscience research, CDC cessation data, and clinical studies on receptor normalization and neural pathway healing timelines.

**I'm open to discussion and modification if you notice a mistake. This is a community effort.**

But the data is the data. And the data says most of you will fail because nobody told you about Phase 2 biology.

---

Brothers and sisters, I have to ask you:

**Does knowing this change anything for you?**

**Are you prepared for what's actually coming?**

You're not weak. You weren't informed. **And you're being asked to fight biology with motivation.**

Now you know the real enemy.

---

## One More Thing

I've been working on a different approach based on this Phase 2 biology problem. Something that respects the 3-6 month timeline instead of ignoring it.

**Something that works WITH your biology, not against it.**

**I'll post it soon. It's free, no sales, no promotion. Just information.**

I think we can do better than 8% success rates. We have to. For all of us.

If you want to see it, let me know in the comments.

We're in this together.

**EDIT:** I'm new to this subreddit and I already notice the incredible support and good vibes here. That's beautiful. But here's why I'm posting this: **I see a severe lack of critical information.** You need intel more than vibes if you want to beat biology. Support is amazing, but it won't rewire your neural pathways. Information will. Let's combine both.",1,1759241342.0,stopsmoking,0,1.0,False

She drags me instead, to some older man’s place,weed stink seeping from the walls, basement damp swallowing the floor.

She smiles like she wants to disappear.I look at her and my stomach flips.
jealousy,
hunger,
revulsion.

Her hair’s in pigtails,long blonde ropes tied too tight. Mini skirt hiked high,thigh socks biting into skin,she looks like a parody of a child acting out someone else’s sickness.

And God,
I’d fuck her.
That’s the filth of it. That’s the truth.

I’m in ripped jeans, crop top,ink carved across my arms, metal punched through my skin , armor I’ve earned.

She’s softer,still cheap,still half-alive with that stupid septum ring.I hate her for being so pathetic.I hate her for being me.

Maybe I’d like her if she kept quiet. But her mouth opens and it’s just tragedy spilling out, pathetic stories about men , basements, her dad and empty nights.

Every word is a knife twisting.Not her fault.Never her fault.But fault doesn’t matter , i’d still want to shake her until she shuts up.

I’d think of saving her.
I wouldn’t.
I know how this ends.

We end the same. On the floor, mirror cracked,white lines like scars waiting to be kissed. 
I tell her I quit.
I lie.
We bend together,
snorting silence,
sharing the ruin.

And when her eyes meet mine,brown-green drowning in black,I know there’s no escape, no forgiveness, only reflection. 
Me and her.
The same dirt.
The same hunger.
The same death

In the last year I have turned from a cappuccino drinker to an espresso one. And (here comes the classical story as always) when I visited Italy this summer, I was amazed by the quality of their espresso compared to the ones I bought in the Netherlands where I live. The Italian one is way thicker, creamy, and not watery at all. I think many of you understand what I mean.

Therefore, I have decided to get myself an espresso machine that would make me an Italian type of espresso. Problem is that I am clueless when it comes to the art of making espresso. What factors matter when it comes to making a creamy espresso. What do I need to look at when it comes to a coffee machine and to a coffee grinder? I recently found this Gaggia E24 which people said its quite good.

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/iaMgO58MQQb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

[**Am I wrong for divorcing my ex-wife over kids and now refusing to be a part of her son’s life?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/17ld4od/am_i_wrong_for_divorcing_my_exwife_over_kids_and/)

I want to preface this by saying that I have no intentions of getting back with my ex and I’m in a very happy relationship with my now fiancée. And I’m sorry this is long, I just wanted to add all the context in and I’m not the best with words.

I (46m) married my ex-wife (45f) when we were 26 and 25 respectively. At that time, we were both on the fence about having kids. I knew since college that I wanted to retire early, and my dream of having financial freedom was what really made me realize that kids didn’t fit into the life I wanted. 

I was trying to find the right time to talk with her about it, but over the next few weeks, she started dropping hints that she wanted kids. She started showing me photos of her friends’ kids, commenting on our nieces and nephews, joking about her getting/being pregnant (that one freaked me out), and even bought me a book on the joys of fatherhood that she “thought I’d find interesting”. 

I sat her down and asked her if she wanted kids, and she admitted that over the years she had grown to want a family. We had a conversation about it and I realized that neither one of us was going to change our minds. I didn’t want to keep her from what she wanted in life, so I brought up divorce. She really didn’t want to divorce, and kept trying to get me to want kids, but I stuck to what I wanted and we ended up separating. 

I obviously still loved her, but that’s why I wanted to divorce. We were still young and she could find someone to have the family she wants with. I didn’t want her to resent me for forcing my life choices onto her.

Even after I filed for divorce, she still didn’t agree with me and dragged it out as long as she could, so the divorce took almost 2 years. I dated over the years, but never really found someone that I could see myself sharing the rest of my life with until I met my now fiancée 4 years ago. Apparently, my ex-wife struggled with dating as well and hasn’t remarried yet. 

She has a son, but the kid’s dad isn’t in the picture. She recently reached out to me and asked if we could meet to catch up. I talked with my fiancée about it and she thought it’d be a great way to clear up any bad blood between us, so I agreed to meet up with her for coffee. Things seemed to be going well until she brought up her son. 

She asked me if I was willing to be a part of his life as a “masculine influence”, and I told her I was glad that she was able to have a child, but that it still wasn’t something I was interested in. She tried to change my mind by saying that we could be a family again. 

She kept trying to convince me, and I kept trying to change the subject. I admit I got frustrated because things weren’t going as I hoped they would, and I told her that I was happy with my fiancée’s name and that I was not interested in her. She started to insult my fiancée so I left.

I thought what happened was crazy. When I agreed to meet with her, it never even occurred to me that she might want to get back together considering how long it’s been and, you know, I’m not single. She kept messaging me, so I blocked her, and I don’t plan on talking with her again. 

I was talking with my sister and her husband about it, and they said that while I’m totally right for rejecting her now, that it was an ah move on my part to divorce her in the first place and that I was now being an ah again by not being a part of her kid’s life. They both agreed that my ex was right for wanting to work it out. 

They said it’s my fault that her child doesn’t have a father and that if I had given having kids a chance, I would have changed my mind. I just don’t agree that kids are something one should “compromise” on. I just don’t see how it’s possible for it to not be a bad situation for everyone involved that breeds resentment. 

I don’t know my ex’s child at all, and I don’t agree that it’s my responsibility to step up just because his bio dad didn’t. I asked some other friends and family, and they agreed with my sister, so now I’m not sure if what I did was wrong or not and I was just wrongly justifying it to myself.

**TL;DR:** I divorced my wife after we fell on different sides of the child free fence. I’m currently engaged, but my ex reached out and wanted to meet up so that she could apologize for how she treated me during and after the divorce. She instead tried to get me to agree to being a “masculine influence” in her kid’s life, but I declined. My sister and BIL think I’m wrong for refusing to be a part of the kid’s life, and that I was also wrong for divorcing my ex in the first place. My mom and some other family and friends agree with my sister.

**Edit:** added tldr and wanted to add that my mom, sister, and most of my other family members and friends are or used to be a part of the same church that doesn’t agree with divorce.

Divorce is kind of a big no-no, and I even stopped talking with a few friends bc they refused to acknowledge my divorce and it was just weird. Although my sister is in the church, she has never been all in and almost left multiple times. My BIL is also not in the church which is a point of contention, but also why I thought the two of them might actually be right and I could be the crazy one. 2 of my friends that I asked are also not in the church and only one of them agreed with me.*

So now she's surprised that somebody who didn't want kids didn't stick around for the kid... How's that your problem?

I was at my parents house when it was brought up and since I knew the guy and I wanted my ex-wife to be happy with a family (which is why I divorced her), I looked into what was going on. I say 98% sure because no paternity test was done so it is possible it’s not his kid.*

# **Final Update - 1 week later**

[**Update: Am I wrong for divorcing my ex-wife over kids and now refusing to be a part of her son’s life?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/17pe5db/update_am_i_wrong_for_divorcing_my_exwife_over/) 

So, some things have happened.

My ex-wife somehow got ahold of my fiancée's phone number. She contacted her yesterday and made false accusations that I cheated on her when we met up for coffee. Obviously, my fiancée didn't believe her and just blocked her number.

This morning, my sister showed up uninvited to my fiancée’s house with her kids demanding to “talk”. We don’t live together and I was not there. My fiancée originally wasn’t going to let them in, but my sister sat on her porch and refused to leave. It was cold and windy and the kids didn’t have coats on, and since it’s not the kids’ fault, she ended up giving in. 

She put on a show for the kids and made some coffee to prepare herself for whatever shit my sister was going to say. My sister started a whole spiel about how if she (my fiancée) really cared about me and not just my money, than she would do what’s best for me, and leave. My sister claimed that since I’ll always be connected to my ex, that I will be forever unhappy if I’m with anyone else. 

Apparently if my fiancée doesn’t leave me, it’s proof that she’s only with me for my money, and that it’s obvious that my ex and “our” child (which, wtf, it’s not MY kid) would actually use the money in a “godly way.” My fiancée laughed in my sister’s face and just stared at her until she left.

1. My fiancée and I are both a little confused by what she said.
2. I am better off financially than my fiancée, but not by that much.
3. I’m also not religious, so even if I DID get back with my ex, me and my money would still not be ✨godly✨

We know she’s crazy, but again, why did she think her “plan” would do anything?

After my sister left, my fiancée called me and told me what happened. I called my sister to tell her 

1. to leave my fiancée alone and 
2. that she was crazy and delusional.

She defended herself by saying that she knew what was best for me and was just protecting me from going through with the wedding since my fiancée was “obviously taking advantage of me,” and that since I’m “under her spell,” I can’t protect myself. I again told her she was crazy and delusional, and told her that I never wanted to hear from her, or anyone who’s siding with my ex, again, and to please pass that message on.

Everytime a family member or friend messages me about it (which has been 6 just since this morning), I ask them what their thoughts on the matter are, and if they side with my ex or sister, I block them.

**TL;DR:** My ex somehow got my fiancée’s number and tried to convince her that I cheated on her. My fiancée blocked my ex. My sister showed up this morning at my fiancée’s house demanding to talk and basically told my fiancée that if she didn’t break up with me, it was proof that she didn’t actually love me and was just using me for my money. Her reasoning was that since I’m still “connected” to my ex, I will be unhappy with anyone who is not my ex, and if my fiancée cared about me, she would leave me so I could be with my ex. I confronted my sister and ended up deciding to go no contact with her and anyone who agrees with her.

My fiancée is also a divorcée, she divorced her ex-husband because he had an affair, and apparently that is not a good enough reason. I know 3 people, including my sister, that have forgiven their spouses for cheating. My fiancée has a very extensive rock collection (hobby), does yoga (easy on the joints), and burns incense (it smells good), and my family has seen a few Facebook posts about witches and thinks she’s one. In their eyes it means she’s “worshipping the devil.”*

**u/Financial_Ad6744**
>I'm not victim blaming, but this does make me question why you went to your sister for advice in the first place since your church going, divorce hating family who already have spawned a gaggle of progeny were unlikely to accept that your first marriage didn't work out because you didn't want kids. People come out with some right shit sometimes like men are more reluctant to have kids - it's so dismissive of anyone who actually doesn't want kids.
>
>You weren't the AH for leaving your wife for wanting different things. You aren't the AH who left his kid without a dad and you're definitely NTA for refusing to parent a child that's not yours and belongs to your ex. The fact is your family are a little wacky and they were not comfortable with your lifestyle choices and think that they can solve it now. I think blocking people who are supporting your ex is probably a good idea, but please do understand that when you and your fiancé are married, this isn't going to be magically fixed.

They encouraged me to not divorce her, to take her back afterwards, and to try and be friends with her, but didn’t push it too hard. They stopped inviting my ex to family gatherings and when they invited her again randomly a few years ago, I left and told them to never do that again and they listened. Basically what I’m saying is that although they’ve always held fast to their beliefs, they haven’t been this crazy or out of line before (about my ex, they went pretty crazy when I stopped going to church but that’s a different story). I know that marrying my fiancée won’t be a magic fix, but hopefully moving across the country after the wedding will help even more.*

# FINAL UPDATE IN THE COMMENTS: 1 year later

She’s now my wife!! I have kept everyone blocked, and although my sister did show up to my house a few times, I threatened legal action and she stopped. My wife and I now live on the opposite side of the country from my family and we haven’t had any issues!

The wedding was wonderful, one of the best days of my life! We now live across the country away from my family and haven’t had any recent issues with them. Thank you for your kind words!

Thank you! My sister showed up to my house a few times, but I threatened legal action and she’s left us alone. My fiancée is now my wife and we currently live on the opposite side of the country from my family.

1nue14j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nue14j,Not sure what clearance plant I just rescued,"So I bought my first home in June and unfortunately can’t rescue all the cats and dogs and other animals in my county because my first rescue pit mix ate through our fence our first week(fence remodeling WIP). So I began to rescue plants from Walmart and Lowe’s (clearance sections). I don’t know much about them and get a ton of contradicting info so I’ve decided to just come to Reddit and get more contradicting info from ppl vs websites or articles written by people. 

I bought this plant for $7 and the original had this purplish/green stem that’s fallen over (photo 2) and I thought- wow $24 to $7! I’ll take this over a cup of coffee at Starbys! 

Anywho, I didn’t know she was expecting and now I’m a plant grandparent and idk what to do or how to care for it? She was in my kitchen, her soil stayed moist. The stuff around it are actually other plants dead stems or old leaves etc because I read I was supposed to do that?? Anyway can someone please tell me what this MIGHT be & how to potentially keep it alive?

1nudzan,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1nudzan/tip_budgetavis_car_rental_pickup/,Tip: Budget/Avis car rental pickup,"We used Budget/Avis for a car rental while in Iceland recently. The car itself was fine, and everything went smoothly once we actually had the keys. But the Avis/Budget counter at KEF is very understaffed for the demand, and we waited 90 minutes to be called. 

They have you pull a number from a ticket machine and wait until your number is called, with different numbers for Avis/Budget/Payless (who all share a counter). Avis Preferred people got to skip most of the wait, as their numbers got preference, but that didn't stop some of the Preferred people trying to skip their short, 5-10 minute line by insisting they shouldn't have to wait like everyone else (ugh). 

At any given time there were between three and four people at a counter, and approximately 50 people waiting. 

My tips if you use one of these companies to rent in Iceland:
1. As soon as you get through immigration, go straight to the car rental place and pull a number from the machine. Wait a few minutes to see what numbers they're on. If it seems like you have a long wait, then go get a coffee/use the restroom/etc. (We did all those things before going to the counter and lost about 20 minutes that way). If you aren't traveling alone and checked luggage, I would have one person wait for luggage and the other go straight to the car rental counter to pull a number. 

2. If you arrived before your reservation and have a long wait, consider pulling a second ticket right around the time when your reservation starts, as a backup. There was a couple there whose flight arrived early and they got to the counter well before their pickup time. When their first number was called, they were told they had to wait and pull a new number, even though they had already waited for a while. 

3. Follow the instructions of the actual signs at the line that give a QR code to scan and start the checkout process while waiting. I did this and the form was easy to complete on my phone, and that's why when we finally got to the counter, we were able to finish very quickly. When we got there, the woman at the counter handed me the same form I'd already filled out, and having filled it out already seems to have saved us a lot of time. Most people were taking 10-15 minutes at the counter, and we were in and out in about 5 minutes. 

4. Please, please actually make a decision about whether you're getting the extra insurance *before* you get to the counter. It was so aggravating waiting while people debated the insurance they'd had 60+ minutes to read about while waiting in line. (And really, take the insurance. And take the warnings about holding the car doors seriously!) 

Anyway, Iceland was lovely but the car rental counter experience was a bummer of a way to start the first day of our trip. ",1,1759240812.0,VisitingIceland,0,1.0,False

1nudyns,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNT/comments/1nudyns/am_i_overthinking_this_interaction/,Am I overthinking this interaction?,"In a new-ish class with a set of 5 other girls. We’re post grad so pretty established in our own personal lives and everyone seems like great, popular and normal girls. 

I’ve gotten used to texting etiquette and how usually in school group chats people don’t reply, and I’ve learnt that the hard way by asking a question slightly irrelevant to the work (more to the campus) and getting nothing in response. 

One of the girls who I have noticed sometimes ignores me when I’m speaking in the group was standing around with all the other girls at the end of the class and I knew she was heading to the library after. 

I asked her individually if she would be, my intention wasn’t to join her but maybe to walk up to the library with her. She said yes but slowly backed away and mentioned she’d be getting coffee first. At this point I guess I should’ve understood her social cue but still didn’t get it, and tagged along to get a sandwich (albeit I intended to do this also, regardless). She was walking a lot faster than me and when making conversation I was mostly asking or trying to chat. Amongst getting to the cafe area she said she’d be going to the toilet first as to not take her coffee in with her, and at that point I said okay I’ll see you later (finally fully got the hint).  

Do we think she probably dislikes me, just wanted to study alone? Should I have acted differently? I feel like I never get these things right and then really harp on them!

1nudx2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForceRecruits/comments/1nudx2u/the_meps_experience_as_a_new_recruit/,The MEPS Experience as a New Recruit.,"I just went to MEPS in St. Louis and had to do my medical and ASVAB, Cyber, TAPAS, and Complex Reasoning tests; I'd like to give my account of the day and the tests for anyone who is going through soon. 

**MEPS Hotel and Medical:**

First, do not panic or worry about the day. I was really nervous the night before, but halfway through the morning, I realized that this was just another doctor's appointment where (some of) the staff seemed like they missed their morning coffee; not mean, just.... stiff. 

We were set up in a decent hotel, and I had a roommate, who turned out to be awesome. When you arrive, they will have you sign in with the general meps liaison, and you will receive your room key and times for breakfast and departure. Breakfast was decent, lots of options for food and drink. Make sure you are drinking a lot of water when you wake up and while eating breakfast, but dont be afraid to pee while you are waiting for the bus because you will have about 45 minutes before you even start your actual medical stuff. If you have to take any tests, then you will do those first, so definitely do not hold your pee through those, or else you will be very uncomfortable while testing. The bus arrived and picked us up, and took us half a mile down the road to the federal building, where the meps is. You'll have to go through security, kind of like at the airport. Super simple, just dont have any weapons or anything stupid with you. MEPS is on the 10th floor. When you arrive, just follow the directions the staff gives you, again, super simple. We all had to start the medical briefing in a classroom before we split up into the testing groups. This is where we all did a breathalyzer, so do not drink alcohol the night before or that morning. We then split up for testing and medical (if you are there for testing, you will test first, then medical after testing). Skip down to be section on testing if you care to read about that.

For the medical, we had to do everything you've read about before: vision, hearing, urinalysis, medical interview, duck walk, and yes, the 'bend and spread'. The medical part is so easy. If you have had a sports physical for school in the past, this is just like that, but a little more in-depth. Do not stress about this. I was actually so glad that medical was after my testing because I knew the stressful part was over. The duck walk is super simple, and I am not sure why it is hyped up as something weird to do. You just squat down and walk heel-to-toe for two steps while squatting. For males, the doctor will briefly feel your testicles for hernias and then ask you to turn around, bend over, and spread your cheeks. I hesitated since it felt so wrong to do so, but he laughed and assured me my saying: ""dont linger, I dont want to see it either, ok."" He asked me a few questions about my medical history, which was incorrect, somehow. I had surgeries listed under my account that I have never had. He said that happens somethimes, but saw that I had no scars in those areas, so he just brushed it off. I needed to get two waivers for two legit issues I had in the past. No big deal. After medical, you will go to your branch's liaison to finish up. Get lunch and go home.  

  
**The Tests:**

After the medical briefing, we split up and went to the testing room. I had to take the ASVAB, TAPAS, Cyber, and Complex Reasoning for the Space Force. Before the test, I practiced with Grammar Hero, and that was all that was needed. The questions are very similar to his videos. I think the Complex Reasoning was the hardest test, actually. You had to put together a broken mosaic of shapes and figure out what it would look like properly assembled. I was pretty tired at this point (bad sleep the night before), and I started to get annoyed at the questions lol. 

The cyber test was general IT, cyber, and programming questions. I forgot how to convert a hex number to decimal, and had to guess on a few questions, but I knew most of the stuff on there from past schooling. Overall, I got a 96 AFQT and a 99 in mechanical, a 97 in admin, a 96 in general, and a 99 in electrical. Just practice and study from Grammar Hero, and you will be fine. I forgot a few of the geometry equations, but the questions I had provided the basic formula. You still need to be able to manipulate that formula to get the answer, but that is super easy. Seriously, stop stressing and practice Grammar Hero. 

  
MEPS is not hard, so please do not worry about it unless you are trying to hide something from the doctors. Just do what you're told, and be glad that you get to go home that day to your family. I had to do everything and finished by 12:30. ",2,1759240660.0,AirForceRecruits,1,1.0,False

I recently bought a Zotac 5090 Amp extreme infinity. Usually, I would buy the xx80 card in the series but the 5080 shouldn't have even been released as it is simply a 5070 Ti that drank a coffee.

Personally, I find it hard to believe how poor the performance of the 5090 is for the price I paid for it.

This experience I am referencing is coming mainly from playing Borderlands 4 and how the game runs better with TSR than it does with DLSS and how it cannot maintain 60fps on very high/badass without frame gen. 

Sure we can blame Gearbox and Unreal or whatever but we didn't pay Gearbox $2400, right? The 5090 costs basically 3x 5070 TIs but delivers between 50 and 80% more FPS. All for the low low power consumption of 600w.

1nudst6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nudst6/can_the_berkey_bk4x2_bb_water_filtration_system/,Can the Berkey BK4X2 BB Water Filtration System Deliver Pure Water? Review Inside!,"The **Big Berkey Gravity-Fed Stainless Steel Countertop Water Filter System 2.25 Gallon with 2 Authentic Black Berkey Elements BB9-2 Filters** (model BK4X2-BB) has been my go-to water filtration solution for several weeks now. With its sleek stainless steel design and emphasis on reducing contaminants, I was eager to put this system to the test. From my daily use to hosting family gatherings, this filtration system has been front and center in my kitchen.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The stainless steel finish is not just visually appealing but exudes a sense of durability. Its compact footprint (8.5""L x 8.5""W x 19.25""H) fits comfortably on most countertops without crowding the space, making it perfect for kitchens like mine where real estate is at a premium. The craftsmanship feels solid—I didn’t notice any loose connections or wobbles, which speaks volumes about its build quality. The 2.25-gallon capacity is ideal for families or small office environments. I often use it to fill up reusable water bottles, saving me countless trips to the grocery store for bottled water.

**The Science Behind the Filtration**  
A standout feature of this product is the inclusion of two Black Berkey Elements, which undergo third-party testing to ensure they effectively reduce over 250 contaminants that might be lurking in freshwater sources. These aren’t just any filters—they're specifically engineered to significantly reduce chlorine, heavy metals, VOCs, and more. While I haven’t sent my filtered water off for lab testing (because who has time for that?), I can confidently say it tastes incredibly clean, with zero metallic or chemical aftertastes. One evening, when my coworker visited, she couldn’t stop raving about how much “smoother” my coffee tasted after I started using this system.

**Ease of Setup and Use**  
For an appliance that doesn’t require electricity or plumbing, this gravity-fed system offers surprising ease of use. As someone notorious for avoiding tools, the straightforward setup was a pleasant surprise. I had water filtering through the system within 15 minutes of taking it out of the box. You simply pour water into the top chamber, and gravity does the rest, making it completely self-sufficient. In a pinch during a power outage last week, its independence from electricity became more evident than ever.

[Check **Big Berkey Gravity-Fed Stainless Steel Countertop Water Filter System BK4X2-BB** price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b00cyw3evo/)

**Positives**  
The **key benefits** of this system became clear after just a few uses.  
- The filtration elements are economical and long-lasting, with a lifespan of up to 6,000 gallons.  
- It's highly portable, which makes it useful not just at home but during picnics or camping trips.  
- Its simplicity means no extra installation or recurring costs, besides the replacement filters.  
- It’s incredibly versatile, improving the flavor of drinking water as well as beverages and meals.  

**Weaknesses**  
No product is without its limitations, and this one has a couple worth mentioning.  
- The filtration rate is on the slower side at 0.03 gallons per minute. For someone impatient like me, waiting for the lower chamber to fill up can feel tedious.  
- At its price point, it would have been nice to get more than two filters as part of the initial setup. Replacement filters are great, but they’re an added cost upfront.

**Competitive Options**  
Comparing it to other countertop filtration systems such as the Brita or PUR models, the Big Berkey differs significantly in its approach. The Brita systems, while more budget-friendly upfront, don’t tackle the extensive range of contaminants that this one does. PUR systems offer basic filtration but often require electricity or plumbing, limiting their portability. However, both competitors tend to have faster flow rates.

In contrast, the Big Berkey stands out for its gravity-fed operation and unmatched contaminant reduction capabilities. But if speed is your priority over purification range, these alternatives might offer a better fit. Its filters also outshine their counterparts in longevity, with most competitors needing replacements every 2–3 months instead of 2+ years.

**Value Proposition**  
Evaluating the **quality for price**, I can say this filtration system feels like an investment rather than just another kitchen appliance purchase. Filtering water for pennies per gallon makes it highly cost-effective in the long run. Pair that with how much bottled water I’m no longer buying (let's just say I used to keep Costco in business), and the value becomes even clearer.

While it’s not the cheapest filtration system, the Berkey is in a league of its own for people who care deeply about the purity and taste of their water. The ongoing filter cost is low compared to how long-lasting they are. This combination of ease, efficiency, and safety makes it worth every penny spent.

TODAY'S 🎙SHOW:  Douglas Tuman sits down with Monero Matteo for a discussion on Monero and its future. Matteo shares why he seldom does interviews, his work as an accountant specializing in Monero, and the challenges of helping businesses adopt privacy-focused tools. They dive into Monero’s potential for decentralized capital markets, business-friendly features like view keys and transaction tagging, and hurdles such as accessibility and accounting integration. The discussion also explores Monero’s philosophy—privacy as resistance to surveillance, the role of proof-of-work, and the community’s “big tent” culture. The episode closes with reflections on freedom, ethics, and Monero’s role in protecting human autonomy

It's been this way for almost my entire life but with school being the one thing I would go outside for. 

Last year I graduated in a very rough year for me that took a lot out of me. So right now I have nothing to look forward to / nothing to wait for that'll start (like a new year of school after summer break) Because of this I haven't had a need to go outside anymore and I've slowly been getting stuck in this bubble that is my pc. I know it's unhealthy and I know there are things I need & want to do but it feels impossible to get myself to go do those things. It used to just be going outside that was hard but now even at home doing stuff that isn't on my pc feels hard to do. Rarely I'll manage to do something but instead of feeling happy or relieved I just feel exhausted. 

But most of the time I just think about doing something, get overwhelmed and slowly escape back to the bubble of my PC that feels safe. So how do I get myself to actually do stuff away from my pc.

For context: I have autism & social anxiety which feel like the biggest things holding me in place, and I also don't have any irl friends who I can go do stuff with outside. ",3,1759239879.0,Explainlikeimscared,0,1.0,False

Is it going to impress hardcore coffee connoisseurs? Probably not! But if you want a decent cappuccino, latte, or ice coffee before work with zero hassle, it does the trick at the touch of a button. Then afterwards, the milk frother has its own quick rinse cycle and you can pop it in the dishwasher, no need to worry about wiping down a frothing wand or washing a milk jug.

I've found for maintenance, especially if you have hard water, use water from a filter like Brita and the machine will last much longer without having to descale. Descaling is not too bad though, the system will walk you through the steps and the kit is only $13 CAD. I haven't seen any build-up yet using filtered water but my previous vertuo machine had this issue with hard water. 

Finally, you are 100% paying a premium for the convenience here... The pods do add up in cost (range from $1 - $2 each) but they run promotions at least every month so make sure to wait for those. The best I've seen is when they give you extra pods for free (e.g. buy $150 worth of pods and get 3 extra sleeves). However, if you want accessories (coffee cups, tumblers, etc.), they have good promotions for those too. NEVER buy sleeves without a promo, they run them too often to miss out on those.

It's absolutely flabbergasting and frustrating to see people being ""diehard"" fans quite literally. I've always detested the Fanboy culture in our state from the bottom of my heart - where people reduce themselves to animal nicknames - anils & aamais and fight on behalf of their favourite actors. 
I cannot understand how people think so so less of themselves and so stupidly high of some other human being just because they acted in a movie - placing them not even on a pedastal but even a high tower. Why the fuck would you freakin ""worship"" some other normal human being? In what world does that make sense?
And how the bloody fuck would you prioritise catching a glimpse of them from afar in a crowded political rally than the safety of your own family?

I'm just angry at those adults who brought their kids along with them. Okay, they will look at Vijay from a distance. Then what? Is he going to have a coffee with them and they will discuss their favourite movie scenes? What do they go expecting out of this situation? Why does just looking at an actor mean so much to them? Crazy hell.

If putting a ban on movies for 5 years or so can reverse and erase this disgusting inferiority complex mindset from our people, I would happily welcome it.

Only if people put all this pent-up devotion, dedication and passion into the betterment of their own lives, we would be a developed nation!

1nudgc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nudgc3/i_got_a_job_at_the_largest_store_in_america_the/,I Got a Job at the Largest Store in America. The Customers Don’t Have Faces.,"They told me the pay was good, but they didn’t tell me the customers wouldn’t have faces.

I wish that was a punchline. I wish I was laughing. I’m typing this on my thirty-minute break in the employee “canteen,” which is a generous name for a windowless room that smells like mop water and microwaved fish. My hands are still thawing out. I’ll probably delete this later and pretend I imagined it. Or I won’t, because I need someone—anyone—to tell me this isn’t normal.

The flyer was duct-taped to a leaning phone pole, the kind with rust creeping up from the staples of a thousand lost-cat posters. HIRING NOW. NO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED. START TONIGHT. It had a phone number and the logo of a store I’d never heard of: GOLIATH MARKET. The name felt like a dare. I called because my rent is a calendar with torn-off days and a landlord who texts “friendly reminder” with nine exclamation points.

A woman answered on the second ring, voice flat enough to iron with.

“Name,” she said.

I told her.

“Report to 1400 Benton at nineteen hundred. Dress warm. Seafood detail. Bring steel toes if you own them.”

I asked if there was an interview.

“This is your interview,” she said, and hung up.

If you try to Google 1400 Benton, the map spins, thinks, and dumps you on a blank stretch of service road like it got bored. You have to trust the turnoff that looks like a drainage easement, then the unmarked lane that dips under a powerline field, then the squat barrier with the lifted arm. No signage. No security guard. Just a three-foot-tall LED display counting numbers that flickered as I drove past: 12,402… 12,403… I thought it was a glitch until I parked and looked up.

Goliath Market isn’t a store. It’s a country. It’s a roofline that curves with the horizon. The lot is a concrete prairie. The entrance is a pair of doors the size of semi trailers with a heat curtain blasting out like a dragon’s sigh. There’s no billboard, no “Welcome Shoppers!” banner, just a tiny, tasteful plaque set in the brick: GOLIATH. I could have walked under that sign ten times and still not noticed it if the wind hadn’t stopped exactly there, like the word itself held the air in place.

Inside, the sound swallowed me. Not noise—sound. A pressure. Imagine standing on the floor of an airplane hangar while someone whispers at the exact frequency of your skull. A man in a navy jacket that said LOGISTICS on the back handed me a high-vis vest and a parka big enough to camp in.

“You’re Landen,” he said, not asking.

“Yeah,” I said. “Do I need to… sign something?”

“You already did.”

I looked down at my empty hands.

He pointed over my shoulder. A laminated badge was clipped to my vest, my name in block letters, and beneath it a title: SEAFOOD DETAIL. I had not put that badge on. The plastic felt warm against my chest, as if it had just been pressed there by a palm.

“Follow the spine to aqua,” he said. “Pallet drops every six minutes. Stock both sides. Keep moving.”

He shoved a handheld scanner into my palm and turned away. I didn’t even get to say my line about being grateful for the opportunity.

The “spine” is a hallway as wide as a four-lane road that runs the exact center of the building. The shelves that branch off it are not shelves. They’re walls. Ten feet tall, thick enough to walk behind. The sign above the first aisle said “Fresh Produce,” but it was a lie. There is no “front” of anything here. The real store is behind the shelves, in the tunnels where the pallets appear and the workers move like bloodstream cells. Customers float on the other side, pushing carts in serene loops, and the two worlds touch only at the vents where product flows through.

You know how in normal stores there’s a “back room”? Goliath’s back room is the store.

The air got colder with every step. Not the metallic breath of a grocery freezer. A cold that felt stacked, like layers of night laid over each other and nailed down. I passed aisles for “Canned Staples,” “Bulk Paper,” “Infant Essentials,” each with a color code—red, white, yellow—until the signs turned a deep Atlantic blue. The tile underfoot wasn’t tile anymore; it was ribbed metal that sang under my boots. The wall sweated frost.

SEAFOOD, said the placard. “Aqua,” said the strip of tape at my feet. A narrow lane opened between two rear walls of shelving. Two pallets sat in the lane, shrink-wrapped towers labeled with SKUs that made no sense: 77-ICELUNG, 12-CRUST-PEEL-LIVE/LIVE. The scanner in my hand chirped, bright and eager. “Welcome, Landen!” it flashed, then immediately showed a task: 77-ICELUNG → CASE 14A-FWD, 14A-AFT. 6 MIN.

I slit the plastic with a box cutter, and fog poured out like breath. Fish—silver bodies minimal as cutlery—nested in trays, eyes filmed over. When I touched the first tray, all the fish convulsed once, in perfect unison, a muscle small as a whisper running through them.

The voice came from behind me.

“Put your hood up.”

I turned. A woman stood half in shadow, the aqua light turning her hair gunmetal. She wore the same high-vis vest and parka, her hood furred, her face red with cold. Her eyes were red in the corners, too—blood vessels spidered from iris to white like fragile cracks in porcelain. She might have been my age. She might have been forty. Here, everyone was a chapped mouth and a shadow.

“Put your hood up,” she repeated. “Trust me.”

“I’m fine,” I said, because the cold bit my ears the way fresh truth bites, and it felt better to be bitten than not. “Is there—do I—”

“You stock,” she said. “Both sides, two lanes at a time. Stay in your lanes. Do not step into a lane that isn’t yours unless a lead tells you to. If someone speaks to you, keep your head down. If you can’t keep your head down, keep your hood up. If you can’t keep your hood up—” She trailed off. “Just keep your hood up.”

“Are you my lead?” I asked.

She shook her head. “You’re new. You’ll see your lead when they need you to see them.”

“Okay,” I said. “Thanks.”

She looked like she wanted to say more. She pressed her lips together until the color drained from them. Then someone whistled from deeper in the maze behind the shelves—just one note, long and flat—and she flinched like the note tugged a string that ran through her.

“Welcome to Goliath,” she said, and left.

The scanner chirped again. I started working.

It’s simple: slice, lift, slide, scan, repeat. The trick at Goliath is not the lifting. It’s the way the world edits while you’re not looking. One moment, the pallet is a column of shrink-wrapped cases; the next, it’s the idea of a column, soft at the edges. I stocked an entire rack on the front side—hands numb, nose itching, hood up—and when I stepped back behind the shelf to grab the next tray, I was not where I had been.

You think you won’t get lost in a straight line until a straight line moves while you blink.

“Keep moving,” someone said behind me. I didn’t turn my head. I kept moving.

Customers drifted on the other side of the case, shapes blurred by fogged glass. I told myself they were normal. They had to be normal. I watched a man—broad shoulders, beanie, work boots—pause and gesture at the product label. He leaned closer to the glass, breath fanning across it, and his breath left no mark. He had no breath. He had no face.

I’m not being poetic. Where his face should have been was smooth skin, pale, like the inside of a wrist. No eyes. No mouth. No nose. Just skin stretched over a skull that must have had holes under it once. He tilted that smoothness toward me anyway, as if he could see me through the glass. As if he had never needed eyes to do it.

“Do you have snow crab?” he asked. The voice wasn’t loud. I didn’t hear it with my ears. I felt it, like you feel bass through your sternum. The sound vibrated in my teeth, and my teeth hurt.

I pointed to the wrong case. I don’t know why I lied. He pushed his cart onward, the wheels squeaking, the squeak a normal sound that made the rest of it worse.

They came like that all night. A woman in yoga pants, a boy in a baseball jersey, an old man with a cane. Ordinary clothes, ordinary movements. Smooth skin where their faces should be. “Is the salmon farmed?” one asked. “Where are the paper towels?” asked another, standing in seafood for reasons I cannot explain. “Do you carry birthday candles, the kind with the glitter?” asked a third. None of them looked concerned about the lack of face. None touched their heads or asked for help. The ones that laughed did it without opening anything at all.

Someone sneezed. The sound startled me so hard I dropped a tray. I looked up, expecting to see spray on glass. There was nothing. The sneeze had all the trappings of a sneeze with none of the mechanics. A cart rolled through the wet patch that still appeared on the floor anyway, near the wheel, the way water sometimes finds you even when you’re under an awning.

I told myself I was hallucinating. I told myself the cold was making me stupid. I told myself anything that was kinder than the thing itself.

When the first pallet emptied, the scanner beeped: GOOD JOB! I wanted to throw it into the ice. I tore down the plastic on the second pallet. The labels here were worse. CRUST-PEEL-LIVE/LIVE meant more than I wanted it to mean. The top tray writhed like a pillowcase full of breath. A lobster’s claw banged against the plastic, and another claw—no bigger than the first, but shaped wrong, as if someone had traced the idea of a claw with their left hand—banged back.

A whistle sounded. Not a human whistle. An alarm. The scanner flashed: DROP INBOUND – 90 SECONDS. I stepped into the lane to make room—and that was when I saw the middle spine open like a maintenance artery. A forklift slid into view, silent, its tires whispering over steel. No driver. The pallet it carried was shrink-wrapped with milky plastic that bulged in soft mounds, like rising bread. A line of condensation trailed behind it.

The forklift halted dead center. The pallet breathed once—a sigh that condensed in the frozen air—and then the plastic split down the middle with a noise like someone peeling skin from a lip. The shrink-wrap fell away in flakes.

Inside were not cases. Inside were jars. Jars the size of coffee cans, filled with clear syrup. Things floated inside, hair-light. Each jar had a label, and the scanner flashed them in the corner of my left eye as if the words were printing themselves on my retina. INFANT NAILS, BROWN. INFANT HAIR, DARK. DECIDUOUS TEETH, MIXED. The scanner chimed with happy suggestion: GREAT FOR SEASONAL DISPLAYS!

I took a step backward. My heel hit something soft. The soft thing groaned.

I spun. A man I hadn’t noticed lay on the metal grating in my lane, curled on his side in a high-vis vest like mine. His hood was down. His hair was clumped with frost. His face was—

His face was fine. He had a face. He had a mouth that moved, opening and closing like a fish rescued and laid on ice. No sound came out. His eyes flicked past me to the forklift, then jerked back to mine, and he shook his head minutely. His hands came up, palms out. Please. Please.

“Hey,” I whispered. “Are you okay? Do you need—”

“Keep moving,” said the voice behind me, and I knew without turning that if I looked I would see another worker, hood up, eyes red at the corners. “Do not step into a lane that isn’t yours.”

“He’s in my lane,” I said.

She said nothing. The forklift slid away on its whisper tires, the pallet of jars breathing soft as it went.

I crouched to help the man up, and he grabbed my wrist. His grip was startlingly strong. He shook his head again, harder this time, and then he released me and rolled, inch by inch, under the shelf. His parka scraped the grate. A single long hair snagged on the edge and snapped, hanging like a question mark. He disappeared into a space that did not look big enough to hold him. The shelf did not move. There was no gap. He was just gone.

“Keep moving,” the voice repeated, closer now, and this time I stood and kept moving because I did not trust my body to do otherwise.

I stocked from behind while customers shopped from the front. The scanner chirped and chirped. My fingers lost color, then sensation. I remember thinking, suddenly and stupidly, about the health video they made us watch at my last job about cold stress. Shivering is good, the video said. Shivering means your body is still trying. When you stop shivering, that’s when you need to worry. I realized I wasn’t shivering anymore. I realized my jaw felt heavy in its socket, as if someone was pressing a thumb under my chin to close my mouth.

At some point a lead must have passed down the lane, because a new strip of tape appeared at my feet: LANE 14B CLOSED. I didn’t see anyone place it. It was just there, crooked, a bubble trapped under the plastic. I stepped over it without thinking, and my breath hitched in my throat in a way that had nothing to do with cold.

“Keep moving,” said the air itself, and now it sounded like the store, the whisper frequency of the roof.

I don’t know how long I worked like that. There are no clocks in Goliath. There are no windows, no sun shadows, no stray drafts that say where a door might be. Only the spine and the lanes and the walls of shelves that make the world into a grid.

The second time someone said my name, it was a customer.

“How’s your mother, Landen?” The voice arrived like a brush of velvet across the inside of my ear.

I froze. The tray of salmon belly slid from my hands and hit the grate with a sound like a knife stepping down a staircase. I stared through the fogged glass. The shape beyond was average in every way: height, weight, the way it leaned on the cart bar with a slouch of a patient, bored person. Smooth skin where the face should have been. The smoothness tilted, attentive.

“I didn’t tell you my name,” I said. My breath came out in a cloud on my side of the glass. On his side, nothing.

“You told us when you came in,” the voice said, mild and amused. “You said it to the counter. You said it to the gate. You said it to your badge.” A soft tap came from the other side of the glass, like a finger testing a mirror. “You’re saying it now.”

I took a step backwards, then another, until the cold of the metal case pressed against my back. My hood fur rasped against the plexi edge. I wanted to call for the woman from before, the one with the red eyes. I wanted to call anyone. My mouth made shapes, and fog billowed, and no sound came out.

The customer’s smoothness inclined slightly to the left, like a head cocked. “Your mother’s favorite candle is vanilla,” the voice told me, musing. “Your favorite aisle is the one with the bulk bags of rice because you like the way they shift when you lean against them. Your favorite door is the one that opens.” The smoothness didn’t have a mouth, but somehow I felt the curl of a smile in my ear. “You won’t like the doors here.”

“Excuse me,” someone said—an actual voice, cut free in the cold—and I flinched so hard I almost fell. A guy in a navy LOGISTICS jacket appeared at my elbow, his clipboard hugged to his chest like a shield. He didn’t look at me. He looked at the customer. Or rather, he looked at the customer’s cart. He gently rotated the cart by the handle, directing it down the aisle, away from me.

“This lane’s closed to guests,” he said cheerfully. His breath smoked in the air like a human’s. “Let’s get you back to center, friend.”

The cart rolled away, cooperative. The shape behind the cart didn’t look back. It didn’t have anything to look back with.

The logistics guy stood beside me for a moment after the cart turned the corner. He didn’t face me; he studied a sheet of paper covered in numbers, or pretended to, because the paper was blank. His eyelashes were rimed with frost.

“You’re doing good,” he said conversationally. “Hood up, head down.”

“What are they?” I whispered. My voice cracked in the middle like ice.

He pretended not to hear. “When your scanner says break, take it. If you don’t want to be… popular, use the tunnel with the yellow grating and don’t make eye contact.”

“With who?”

“Exactly,” he said, and walked away.

The scanner beeped. BREAK – 00:30:00. I didn’t know where the break room was. My feet did. I don’t have another explanation. My feet turned down a lane I hadn’t stocked, crossed the spine, cut through “Seasonal,” which was all beige and gray in cardboard boxes labeled with months that didn’t exist—OCTEMBERB, NOVEMBEREST—and slid through a tunnel with yellow grating into a hall where the sound softened enough that human voices could float on top of it like leaves on floodwater.

The canteen had twelve identical round tables. Each chair was bolted to the floor, little silver round scars at the feet. A vending machine hummed in the corner with the persistence of a gnat. The offerings were industrial: soups with nouns only (CHOWDER, STEW), candy bars whose wrappers said things like PROTEIN and ENERGY in fonts that look like slogans. A bulletin board held notices with a corporate cheeriness that made my stomach drop: YOU ARE THE ENGINE! TEAMWORK IS THE FUEL! A second board held laminated photos of employees in their gear, faces blurred—not censored, not pixelated, just… soft. If you’ve ever taken a photo and the autofocus locked on the wrong thing, you know the look. Nothing in the canteen was in focus.

The woman from before sat alone at a table, stirring a foam cup of something like soup. Her hood was down. Her hair was slicked by melted frost. Up close, her lips were chapped to the point of bleeding in fine lines. She didn’t look up when I sat.

“Thank you,” I said. It sounded small in here, smaller than the whisper-store, smaller than the stretch of the roof.

“You kept your hood up,” she said. It was not praise so much as diagnosis.

“What does that do? The hood?”

“Sometimes they forget you have a face if you make it hard to see.”

“They don’t forget anything.”

“Not the customers,” she said, and finally she looked up. Her eyes were the only warm thing about her. They were brown—ordinary, real brown, flecked with gold that caught the overhead light. They made her face look… like a face. “The people you don’t make eye contact with.”

I waited. She went back to stirring.

“I saw a pallet,” I said to fill the silence. “Jars. Teeth. Hair. Infant… nails. Do we stock that? What section is that even for?”

“Seasonal,” she said. “Endcaps, but not the ones the guests see.”

“You mean the back endcaps? Who buys it?”

She gave a small, brittle smile that cracked one of the lines on her lip. “You’ll learn we don’t ask that.”

“What’s your name?” I asked.

Her hand paused on the cup. She stared at the steam, as if she could read in it whether that was a safe question.

“You don’t have to—”

“Dara,” she said, and then looked almost startled, as if someone had spoken through her. “It’s Dara.”

“I’m—”

“I know.” She tapped my badge with a finger. The plastic thudded, dull, like a heartbeat under a pillow. “Don’t say it. Not in here.”

“Why not?”

She gestured toward the vending machine with her chin. On the glass, where the light hit the reflection just right, there were handprints. Not on the surface. Inside the glass. As if something had pressed against it from the racks where the candy should be and then remembered it was candy and turned back into candy. I didn’t realize I was holding my breath until my ribs hurt.

“Don’t say it,” she repeated quietly. “Names are how they hold you steady.”

“Who is they?”

The room’s fluorescent bulbs hummed in chorus like a nest of wasps. Dara’s eyes tracked something behind me. I fought the urge to turn. Cold skated up the back of my neck as if from a door that had opened without air.

“Look at your soup,” she said. “If you didn’t bring soup, look at your hands. If you don’t want to look at your hands, look at me. But do not look behind you.”

“What’s behind me?”

She smiled without meaning it. “You don’t want to be popular.”

“I’ve been popular exactly never,” I said. It came out too loud.

The humming faltered, just for a beat. In that beat, something like breath touched the hairs at the nape of my neck and counted them. I looked at Dara. She looked at me, and because she looked at me, I didn’t turn.

The breath withdrew, bored. The humming resumed at a hair higher pitch, almost celebratory.

“You’ll learn the rules,” Dara said. “Hood up in aqua. Keep your head down in the spine. No eye contact when the floor grates are yellow—only yellow, not red—and if the pallets breathe twice, call logistics and pretend you don’t notice when the call doesn’t go through.”

“What happens if—”

“Break’s over in six,” she said. “You should eat.”

My hands shook a little as I peeled foil off a cup of CHOWDER. It tasted like salt and wet cardboard. It tasted like something that used to be food.

“How long have you worked here?” I asked.

Dara considered. “You stop counting,” she said at last. “They don’t like anniversaries.”

“They who—”

“Don’t.” She didn’t say it like a scold. She said it like you tell someone not to touch a fence because you can hear the electricity in it.

I watched her mouth the word in my head until its edges rounded. Don’t. Don’t. The cup warmed my palms. I think I would have dozed sitting there if the cold hadn’t sharpened my focus whenever it started to soften. I think that might be the point of the cold.

The scanner on my hip beeped. Dara’s beeped half a second later. BREAK – 00:00:30. Then BREAK – 00:00:05. Then it flashed a smiling face that was only lines on a screen but still managed to make my stomach muscle clench. BACK TO IT, CHAMP!

We rose together. Dara pulled her hood up until it shadowed her brow. I did the same. We passed the bulletin board. I pretended not to see that the photo in the center—the one with the employee of the month plaque screwed under it—had my orange vest in it. Not mine. A vest like mine. A person wearing a vest like mine, whose face wasn’t blurred so much as erased in a different way, the surface pulled smooth like a bedsheet over a ghost. The plaque said CONGRATULATIONS, LAND— The last letters were smeared by a drip of something that dried like sugar.

“Dara,” I said, as we reached the yellow grating. “Earlier you said if you can’t keep your hood up…” I waited.

She tied her drawstrings tighter. The ends slapped her chest like church bells.

“If you can’t keep your hood up,” she said, “keep your mouth closed.”

“That’s it?”

“That’s what you can control.” She stepped into the tunnel. The light changed. The cold came back like a hand over my mouth.

Back in aqua, a new pallet waited. The shrink-wrap had fogged from the inside. The label said 12-CRUST-PEEL-LIVE/LIVE again, but a black marker had drawn a line through the second LIVE and written something I couldn’t read, the letters overlapping like handwriting from two people on the same phone line.

I slit the plastic. The scanner chirped.

“Welcome back, Landen,” it flashed. “We missed you.”

I stacked. The customers flowed. They talked to me without mouths. I kept my head down. I kept my hood up.

When it happened, it happened quietly. No music sting. No jump-scare.

I leaned to press a tray into the front case. My breath hit the glass and smeared. My glove slipped against the fog. I swore, the word small and private under the noise. I looked down at my own reflection in the plexi to wipe where I’d smudged.

For a second I didn’t recognize the person looking back. Because there weren’t features to recognize.

It wasn’t total. Not gone. Not blank. Just… softer. My mouth had edges like a watercolor mouth, the line of the top lip blurred into the skin above, the philtrum a memory. My nose looked… correct if you didn’t look directly at it. When I tried to focus, the bridge fuzzed like heat shimmer over a road. My eyes were still there. My eyes were still mine. But when I blinked, the lids took a fraction longer than eyelids take to open, like they were lifting against syrup instead of air.

I jerked back, hard enough that the tray I was holding slipped and cracked against the grate. Fish slid like coins scattering. My hood brushed the edge of the case and popped off my head. Cold grabbed my ears with two delighted hands.

Across the glass, a customer turned its smoothness toward me with the eager attention of someone who hears their name in a crowd.

I grabbed my hood, my fingers clumsy. The fabric caught on my badge. The plastic pulled tight against my chest. I heard the tiny crack before I felt it. The clip snapped. The badge fell. It skittered across the grate and slid under the case, into the front world, the world of carts and smooth faces.

The customer reached down. Its hand—gloved in a knit glove with a snowflake pattern—picked up my badge and held it up to its blankness as if inspecting it.

“Landen,” the voice said warmly, right against my eardrum. “We’ve been trying to remember you.”

I lifted my eyes just enough to see over the edge of my hood. Dara stood at the end of the lane. She was looking right at me even though she shouldn’t have been. Her hand was up, small and hard as a stop sign. Don’t.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. The badge dangled from the knit glove like a baited lure. The scanner on my hip beamed a little chime—TASK COMPLETE!—because the fish on the floor counted as stocked so long as they were technically on the correct side.

“Welcome to the team,” the customer said lovingly, and I felt the words inside my mouth like fingers checking my teeth.

I closed my mouth. I pulled my hood up. I looked at my hands.

My break is over. I have to go back out. If you don’t hear from me by morning, don’t come looking. If you see a store this big hiring, don’t apply. And if you already did—

Keep your hood up. Keep your head down.

This isn't anything major but I really need some guidance and perspective as this kind of thing happens often in our otherwise normal and loving relationship.

My SO (we'll call him D) is severely OCD, the obsessive thoughts and rumination type, and I have an easily triggered gag reflex. It goes off with my morning coffee, sometimes when smoking, often when I feel overwhelmed/stressed, when brushing my teeth, etc. I'll just wretch once and it's gone, nothing major, my mum's the same and we've always been this way. However, D is scared of having children to the point of panic, and even though I have and IUD will ask me to run a test every now and again. Even though initially this offended me as I know my body and its signals well (we already got pregnant and terminated once before the IUD), I happily comply for his peace of mind, anything to keep him calm.

Now, today instead of doing my usual pee into something and stick the test in, I decided to pee directly onto the stick and didn't really get the sucker. For anyone unfamiliar with them, you can't really go back and re-wet them, the test is void.

This led to a whole blow out from D, raised voice, blame, ""You should have done it like this! How could you fuck this up!"" and comments of the sort. He then said to not bother making lunch, locked himself in our workshop and hasn't spoken to me since.

I know it seems like a silly thing to mess up, and he's likely feeling very anxious over it, but I feel getting angry over it, making me cry and then stone walling just isn't the answer? He is prone to having short-lived angry spouts and sincerely apologising afterwards, but it feels like something I shouldn't put up with.

1nudd4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1nudd4l/does_the_ebl_aa_battery_20_pack_deliver/,Does the EBL AA Battery 20 Pack Deliver Long-Lasting Power Review?,"The EBL B0DR7TFVQM AA Batteries immediately intrigued me when I noticed the emphasis on their long-lasting power and environmentally friendly design. Given their promise of reliability and their standout packaging featuring 20 high-performance AA alkaline batteries, I decided to test them in various household devices that demand consistent energy output. Here’s my experience with this product, warts and all.

**Design and Packaging**

From the moment I opened the box, it was clear that this product was designed with practicality in mind. The compact packaging made storing unused batteries easy, while the clear labeling ensured quick access when needed. What stood out for me was how the batteries were securely housed, which prevented any accidental pressure or leaks during transportation. Plus, their sleek silver and green exterior gave them a modern, professional look that made them feel like a premium product.

**Long-Lasting Performance**

I put these batteries through multiple tests, and boy, did they deliver. My TV remote, for instance, consumed batteries faster than my morning coffee. However, with these AA batteries, the remote was still running strong weeks later. The same battery set powered my son’s toy car for several days straight, while the wall clock I installed them in hasn’t stopped ticking since day one. EBL’s claim of extended power truly matches its performance. But I noticed a slight dip in performance with high-drain devices like portable speakers—they still worked, but not for as long as I’d hoped.

[Check EBL B0DR7TFVQM price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b0dr7tfvqm/)

**Safe, Leak-Proof Reliability**

Leakage is a dealbreaker for me, as it can ruin expensive devices. These batteries, however, boast advanced, leak-proof technology—and I’ve experienced no incidents thus far. Even in an old flashlight that tends to overheat, the batteries held up without any sign of malfunction. The reassurance that they’ll protect my devices over long durations adds significant value to their usability.

**Environmental Responsibility**

Another notable highlight is their eco-conscious construction. These AA alkaline batteries are free from harmful materials like mercury and cadmium, which gives me peace of mind that they’re safer for both my household and the environment. Unlike rechargeable options, they’re designed specifically for single-use, but it’s comforting to know their components are responsibly engineered. My sister, who is quite the environmental advocate, even pointed out how EBL strikes a laudable balance between performance and sustainability.

**Versatile Compatibility**

No device seemed off-limits. From cameras to gaming controllers, and even my least-used kitchen scale, these batteries proved their versatility time and again. They transitioned smoothly across all essentials in my home. I think they’d be especially useful for anyone juggling lots of tech gadgets or family toys that require consistent energy flow.

**Merits**

- Long-lasting durability across low-to-moderate drain devices  
- Reliable leak-proof construction that safeguards gadgets  
- Sleek, compact packaging for practical storage  
- Mercury- and cadmium-free for an eco-friendly design  

**Areas for Improvement**

- Not rechargeable, which limits their appeal for frequent power users  
- Slightly underwhelming in high-drain devices like portable speakers or external flashlights  

**Competing Brands**

I’ve tested many other AA options, from Duracell to Energizer, which are household staples for a reason. Compared to those, EBL batteries stand out in terms of affordability and packaging size with this 20-pack—more bang for your buck if you have high-volume requirements. Duracell still edges ahead in longevity for power-draining devices, though, while Energizer excels in balancing rechargeability and performance without the waste. Brands like AmazonBasics offer a budget alternative, but the confidence in EBL’s proven leak-proof guarantee is tough to beat for gadget-heavy environments.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

From a value perspective, these batteries succeed in combining affordability and reliable performance. Their 20-pack nature mitigates the need to replace batteries frequently, especially in less power-intensive gadgets. While they lack the rechargeability that might appeal to someone budget-conscious in the long-term, their upfront reliability justifies their price point. For typical users with everyday needs, they present a solid purchase option.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

1nuda1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1nuda1d/aita_for_telling_my_husband_to_stop_being_a/,AITA for telling my husband to 'stop being a crybaby and get over it' when he caught me sleeping with his best friend in our bed?,"I screwed my husband's best friend in our bed while our kids were at school, and when he walked in on us, I told him to stop acting like a little bitch and get over it.

That was three months ago. Now I'm living in my car, my bank accounts are frozen, and my own mother won't return my calls. But let me back up.

My husband and I were together for twelve years. Two kids, nice house, the whole suburban dream. His best friend had been around since before we even met. Always at our house, always at family dinners. My husband trusted him with everything.

The affair started last year. Just texts at first. Then meeting for coffee when my husband was at work. Then hotels during lunch breaks. I told myself it was just physical. Just something exciting to break up the monotony of marriage.

The day it all went to hell, I thought my husband had a client meeting until evening. His friend came over around noon. We didn't even make it upstairs at first. Started in the kitchen, ended up in our bedroom.

My husband came home because his meeting got cancelled. I heard the front door but figured we had time to get dressed. We didn't.

He stood in the doorway for maybe ten seconds. Just staring. His friend scrambled for his clothes, mumbling apologies. My husband didn't say anything to him. Just looked at me.

""How long?"" That's all he asked.

I could have lied. Should have lied. But I was angry at being caught, so I told him. ""A year. Maybe more.""

His face just went blank. He turned to his friend. ""Get out of my house.""

After his friend left, my husband sat on the bed. Our bed. The bed we'd shared for over a decade. He put his head in his hands.

""I need you to leave too,"" he said.

That's when I lost it. Started yelling about how he was never home, never paid attention to me, how this was partly his fault. Real mature, I know. Then I said it. The thing I can't take back.

""It was just sex. Just a stupid mistake. Stop being such a crybaby and get over it.""

He looked up at me then. I'd never seen that expression on his face before. Like I was a stranger. Like I was nothing.

""A mistake is forgetting to pay a bill,"" he said. ""A year of lying to my face while fucking my best friend in our bed isn't a mistake. It's a choice. A thousand choices.""

He left the bedroom. I heard him on the phone with a lawyer twenty minutes later.

The divorce papers came fast. Really fast. Turns out he'd been documenting things. Screenshots of credit card charges at hotels. Texts between me and his friend that I thought I'd deleted. Security footage from our doorbell camera showing his friend coming over when my husband was at work.

But the real kicker? He sent everything to everyone. Our families. Our friends. The other parents at our kids' school. Screenshots of texts where I called him pathetic for working so much. Where I laughed about him with his friend. Where I described things we did in detail.

My phone blew up. My sister called me disgusting. My father said I broke his heart. My mother just cried.

I tried to fix it. Went to his parents' house, begging them to talk sense into him. His mother answered the door. This woman who'd called me daughter for over a decade looked at me like I was garbage.

""Please,"" I said. ""He's being unreasonable. It was just sex. I made a mistake. The kids need both parents together.""

She laughed. Actually laughed in my face.

""You fucked his best friend for a year and you think he's being unreasonable?"" she said. ""You're not welcome here. You're not family anymore.""

His father appeared behind her. ""You're a disgusting whore,"" he said. Just like that. Calm as anything. ""Don't come back here.""

They shut the door in my face.

The divorce was final last month. He got primary custody. The house. Most of our savings. I got two weekends a month with the kids and a reputation that follows me everywhere.

His friend lost his job when the screenshots made it to his employer. His wife left him too. Last I heard, he moved back in with his parents in another state.

My husband's dating someone new now. A teacher at our kids' school. My kids like her. They told me she makes better pancakes than me.

I keep thinking about that day. How different things could have been if I'd just apologized. If I'd shown some remorse instead of attacking him. If I hadn't spent a year destroying everything we built.

But mostly I think about what he said in court. When the judge asked if he had anything to add, he stood up and said, ""I gave her twelve years of my life. Two beautiful children. My trust. My love. And she gave me back nothing but lies and betrayal. I don't want revenge. I just want her gone.""

So here I am. Thirty-five years old, living in my car, applying for jobs that won't hire me because everyone in town knows what I did. My own family barely speaks to me. My kids ask why they can't live with me full time and I don't have an answer that doesn't make me sound like the bad guy.

Because I am the bad guy. I know that now.

AITA for thinking maybe, just maybe, burning my entire life down wasn't worth some afternoon sex with a man who ran away the second things got hard?

1nud9py,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1nud9py/quit_smoking_calorie_restriction_anxiety_panic/,"Quit smoking + calorie restriction = anxiety, panic, weird heart symptoms. Anyone relate?","About a month ago, in order to lose weight, I drastically cut calories and started eating only once a day, plus walking about 10 km daily.

One day my girlfriend and I were supposed to go to a concert, and I thought I’d eat right after it. So I didn’t eat anything all day, we walked to the concert (about 2 hours), and I only ate late at night. Naturally, the whole time I was smoking. Not one after another, but still a lot. I should also say that lately I had been smoking much more than usual – about 1–1.5 packs of IQOS per day. First thing in the morning, 1–2 sticks, and always right before bed as well.

After the concert I ate something not very nutritious and felt a nervous twitch. The next day I skipped breakfast again, went for another long walk, and then had coffee (with a cigarette, of course). I should mention that I rarely drink coffee, because it makes me anxious and messes with my stomach. Same thing happened here. That salad didn’t last long in me either.

The next day I started to feel like my heart was beating irregularly, like it was skipping a beat or something. That really scared me, since it had never happened before. I should add that I’m generally an anxious person, but I’ve never had depression and never taken any meds for mental health. For the first couple of days, I started restoring calories and fluids, bought electrolytes, etc., but I was still under heavy stress — everything felt foggy, like my head was spinning, and inside I was shaking. On the third day I decided to smoke again, but I felt this weird unpleasant sensation in my head, like when you smoke a really strong cigarette (pressure in the eyes, a bit dizzy). At that moment I decided that’s it, I’m done with smoking.

I went to the doctor, did bloodwork, ECG, ultrasound. They said everything was fine, only slightly high cholesterol, but nothing serious.

A week later the stress started to ease, my girlfriend came back from vacation, but I still had headaches. The cravings for cigarettes were only strong the first 1–2 days. Then I caught a cold (flu-like symptoms), and strangely enough, it felt like the other symptoms went away — I was able to drive again, slowly got back appetite and even joy in life.

BUT two days later I started getting adrenaline rushes in the mornings and during the day. Sometimes I suddenly want to cry, feel intense fear and my whole body shakes, blood pressure spikes to 140/90, heart rate to 130–140. Walking helps a little, but sometimes I feel really awful. No appetite, no libido, no motivation to do anything — just apathy and fear. At the same time, I sleep well, 8–9 hours a night, and in the evenings I feel more relaxed. I go for walks, take magnesium and vitamins.

Now it’s day 19 without cigarettes, and day 23 since this all started.

I’ve been smoking for about 13 years. I’m 28.  
I also used to smoke weed on and off (like one week yes, one week no, then sometimes nothing for half a year), and I drank beer almost every evening, but just one can, not more. Cigarettes, though, were always constant.

Has anyone had something similar? When the anxiety hits, I get very worried that something serious is wrong with my health, since the symptoms actually started before I quit smoking. Another thing that really scares me is that I had a couple of days when I felt like my old self — happy, normal — but then it came back again, and now nothing brings joy at all. Feels like things are only getting worse.

Most likely I burned out my nervous system and made it worse by quitting smoking at the same time.

It’s gotten to the point where I can’t even sit down without moving his stuff first. The couch has become his second closet, and the coffee table might as well be a dumping ground.  
The kicker? He gets annoyed if my things are out for even a second.

# Search & Destroy

Amilita was proud. Everything she’d worked for had led to today, and it was, she suspected, just the beginning. So much sacrifice, so many hours across countless regions and departments, and they’d finally managed what seemed impossible. She stood in the Governess’s office, ready to pop the metaphorical champagne. Depending how it would be received by humanity, there might even be such a possibility later. Already, Lieutenant Ryiannah was hard at work coordinating with local news outlets.

“Excellent work,” Amilita commended the Interior Officer, standing as straight as she could. “If you were a marine, I’d award you with a medal. As it is, I can put in a good word for one and offer you my personal thanks, as well as cooperation on a few matters.”

“As can I,” Cre’sin added. “I can put you in for a few local awards, but given that it’s doubtless a team effort on the part of the Interior, we’ll have to wait for a full report before that can happen.” Amilita didn’t blame Cre’sin for not wanting to bend any rules in this situation, and also knew better than to expect that full report to ever be declassified. Their visitor’s nameplate was blank, as was often the style of one tasked with intruding on the affairs of Noblewomen. ‘Agent Three’ was how she’d been catalogued in her application. Still, at least the offer from Cre’sin sounded heartfelt.

The Interior Officer’s face was surprisingly placid in response, almost disturbingly so. She drew up a breath, all professional poise, as she immediately called upon what goodwill she might have earned with Delaware’s General.

“Then as a way of showing thanks, you could offer full cooperation in apprehending the one known as ‘Emperor’.”

*You take glory for apprehending several noblewomen and their corrupt facilitators, then want to turn around and stab the one who made that possible in the back.* Amilita suppressed a sigh. No one ever said the Interior’s reputation wasn’t well-earned.

“I’m afraid that isn’t a priority,” Amilita offered diplomatically. “Given the state’s green status, we are presently focused on completing the rehabilitation of an endangered species, and developing the local area.”

“If it is not a priority, make it one,” the Interior Agent responded with the same overly-polite tone that ran at complete odds with her aggressive, demanding words. “I’ve been granted dispensation to remain in-state.”

“By Emperor himself,” Amilita pointed out. “For the purpose of handing back the child.” She’d passed the Agent’s ID number through, in lieu of a name.

“Foolish of him to do so, it will make my task easier,” she responded flatly. “A criminal does not run this state, General, Governess. You do. Or else it is in rebellion, and the Interior has ways to deal with that. Rumor is that we will soon be able to consult locally. A demonstration is being booked for later, if you would like to see the result of displeasing the Crown.”

Amilita noticed how Cre’sin went completely still at that, and paler than the white marble bust that now sat upon her wooden desk. All that noble training, and yet when they leaned on it, it showed like a nervous tic. One that the Agent certainly was trained to spot. Amilita wondered if this was a designed weakness. The Royalty helped set up the noble schools’ training, unchanged for centuries, and so too could hand ways of countering the training to the Interior, tasked with moderating the influence and power of the Nobility.

*They might be trained for the Nobility, but they’re not trained to handle us.*

“I think,” Amilita said evenly, stepping between the Governess and the Interior Agent, who at last blinked and stepped a respectful pace back from the protective General. “That your agency’s services will be rewarded for what brings peace between humanity and the Shil’vati, and robs humanity of any reason to fight on. For every missing boy returned, they have one less grievance.”

“They will always have a grievance,” the Agent dismissively snorted. “Always. The key is to make the point that rebellion is unwise, not cave in to their every demand.”

“This is a planet of beautiful fools. You will learn that, Agent Three.”

Amilita watched her leave without comment and only turned to her Governess once the door closed. Cre’sin seemed taut as a wire, eyes still fixed on the closed entrance.

“Well,” Amilita offered a slight, grim smile. “We have a difficult choice in front of us, don’t we? Would you like some tea? It might help you relax. Besides, an…interesting proposal has floated across my desk.”

*****

Borzun got the data request, and then noticed the task disappear right out of her queue.

Odd. The situation aboard had been tense lately. Was her colleague trying to do her a favor suddenly, by lightening her workload? Something to break the ice and free the currents, warm the waters they swam in?

She tried to recall what few words she’d read of the subject line before it had vanished, before deciding to use her credentials to recall it anyway. Only to read: *File Locked.*

The onetime Data Diver had been locked out of classified orders before, of course. But rarely had it been deliberately hidden. Then a new message pinged to her station, from General Amilita: *Interior Agent might be trying to stir up trouble in Delaware. Don’t service requests.*

Borzun was tempted to ask whether Amilita was going to tell Emperor to rescind the visitation rights he’d granted. If the Interior was finally making their move…well, it also said something about who’d taken the task, and her position aboard the station.

*The Station is servicing the request. I can’t tell them not to do so. I manage my team, not the station.* She worried that even with her advancement she still wasn’t able to see the request. The Interior was playing with their screens held close to their flat chests.

That was when a ping appeared on her wrist-comm. A meeting, cleared for- her breath hitched. That was another irregularity. *The Asset.*

*****

“Water?” He offered, loose tweed jacket sleeve swallowing his wrinkled hand where he tapped the filled cup. “It’s about all I have to offer you, unfortunately.”

The old Auxiliary Bridge was a place of nightmares. Cramped even when compared to her office, it had been made only marginally more spacious by having completely removed the terminals for all the comms, leaving only screens for local connections. Restricted to read-only, of course. And being occupied by one man, rather than the suggested three needed to keep a ship of this size truly operable.

The comforts here were better, though. Gravity closer to 1G, heat, air so thick it almost tasted like soup. The light was tuned to be warmer, closer to human preference. This was in contrast to the last time she’d been here, and it seemed that over time he had found ways to adjust his living situation even more.

“No thanks,” Borzun said. She was aware they were being monitored on video, as all conversations were to ensure the lonely girls aboard didn’t get any bright ideas. She put a hand out for the screen, even though it was rude to refuse a man’s offer, doubly so for one so much her senior.

“As you know, I’ve been up here for a long, long time,” his voice was a little hoarse, like the repeated word strained him as much as the isolation.

“I can’t help with that,” she said sadly. “It wasn’t my choice to bring you here.” Was that why he’d called her in?

“I think you can. I know you and Amilita, the General planetside, are close.” His supposition came with a searching look, and he seemed to feel he saw confirmation in her reaction. “You could ferry a message to General Amilita for me. I’m something of an admirer. Though admiring is all I can do from up here. I can piece together what’s happening down there from all the requests. I’ve also noticed they’re fewer and further between. Lower urgency.” The words were rushed, now. Eager, almost desperate.

Amilita knew about the Asset’s existence already, of course. Borzun suspected every station had at least one.

He paged through the notepad, then rotated it to reveal a rough scrawl in shil’vati, jacket sleeve that swallowed his wiry forearm blocking the contents from the camera. He must have worked hard to learn the language’s written from.

*\*Pass word of my situation here along, to the Emperor. I ask him for help.\**

That would *massively* complicate matters. If Emperor took exception to the situation…then again, if what was supposedly happening to the nobility found harboring children was true? What would the consequence of *not* handing over the information be, if it came to light, and he revealed she’d suppressed his pleas?

“I’ll do what I can,” she at last promised and he tore it from the top, then crumpled it in his fist. “Was there anything else?”

“Yes. Be extremely careful.”

That caused her to blink. “Of?”

He leaned in. “The requests I’m receiving. That’s all I can say. Now, I think our visitation is over. It would be good to see you again, when you have something to show me.” He offered a bright smile, clearly avoiding looking at the camera that watched them both, and Borzun left with a shudder that had nothing to do with the station’s thin atmosphere.

## Alic'trian 

Amilita boarded space station Lagrange-1, her officer car’s utilitarian cushioning falling away as the door swung open, letting her stretch her limbs in the cavernous neosteel hangar. All around her was the chaotic bustle of people coming-and-going, carrying tools and equipment or pushing along hovering cargo pods. There were little knots though, where the flow of a creek pushed together in an eddy, catching the curious to twist in a circle and observe some spectacle or another.

She had selected the right bay, but her son wasn’t here quite yet. Hardly unusual, given she was a few minutes early. Still, she decided to go find him first, propelled by the void in her chest.

Using her parental override to find the rendezvous, her heart sank as she found her son at the center of one of the biggest ones yet, looking utterly unbothered by the way foot traffic all around him would slow as civilian and marine alike slowed to turn their heads, coming close but never *too* close to warrant direct dealing with by his armed Marine escorts, part of the public service for any servicewoman.

A boy was not *necessarily* a rare thing on Earth, but this was far from its surface, and tickets down were hard for contractors to come by. Even the Marine Escort, on-edge as they were, seemed relieved to see the General approaching, one nudging the other. Both made a symbol acknowledging the handoff, and then departed without another word, before she could try and retain their help.

When she broke through the inner circle, she immediately understood why.

On her son’s shirt was a familiar face, and the words:

[***Emperor Did Nothing Wrong***](https://i.imgur.com/LSxBjbz.jpeg)

Like someone had pulled the plug on the eddy, most onlookers took one glimpse at her rank and hastily departed.

“Alic’trian,” she breathed by way of greeting, despite all the years apart, to the young teenage boy. “What are you wearing?” Even if he wasn’t far too young for it, it would still be *massively* inappropriate, and was earning him all the wrong kinds of stares, for multiple reasons.

“A shirt,” he answered, as if it wasn’t so shocking that it had brought his mother’s seven and a half foot frame to an absolute standstill rather than sweeping the petite boy up in a motherly hug as she’d first intended. Even if he was getting to that age where, now that she took him in, she realized it might even be slightly inappropriate to do so.

“Yes, and thank the goddesses for that.” Though in truth, it wasn’t much of one. Thin of fabric, and stretched despite its small size. “Do you know what that says?”

He shrugged, uncaring, as a boy his age should start to learn not to be when it came to appearances. His Debut wouldn’t be more than a couple years from now, but to dress like this? It was far more than testing the waters. It was daringly offensive, an open invitation for a Marine to take offense and use it as an opportunity to strike up conversation, and from there, to- she scrubbed her mind of the thoughts that followed.

“I’m on thin enough ice with the Interior as it is,” Amilita managed to keep herself from shouting just to get through to him. She’d accomplished this by barely any margin, and her son clearly heard her, though that unbothered, blase, ‘tired of the world, sick of it all,’ look still didn’t vanish.

“Good. Let the bitches seethe.”

What had gotten into her sweet little boy? Did he resent the long deployments, time away from home? Right now the only sweet thing about him was the wet lollipop in his hand.

“Enough,” she finally stood over him.

“Oh, what’s this? You’re going to step in my face, tower over me? Hit me?” He asked, crossing his thin, bare arms, breaking his momentary focus from the treat to gaze up at her defiantly. “All I have to do is scream. You think you’re in trouble now? Try holding onto your post when they’re dragging you from the station in restraints,” he flicked his eyes around his mom to where a laggard had been standing and staring, then back up to her, expression entirely too knowing for her liking.

The depths-damned infuriating thing was that he wasn’t wrong at all. It had been a gambit and he’d seen right through it. “You’re coming with me,” she snarled. “Now.”

“That was always the plan,” he shrugged casually, popping the hard candy on a stick back in front of his face and making a lengthy bit of eye contact with one of the staring shil’ girls, who seemed unable to tear her gaze off the young man’s mouth and his lewd tongue motions. She was actively trying to look past Amilita to ogle Alic’trian, escort’s status as a General be damned. If she was that brazen, and the General had actually tried to grab her son by the ear, there was a good chance there’d be an altercation, to the depths with rank, just for a favorable introduction.

*Thank god Elias isn’t anything like- aha!*

An idea began to form in her mind.

*****

“So you wanted to see human culture?” Elias offered as a way of greeting from the doorway, freezing at the sight of the other boy in her office. There was a slight sheen of either cooling sweat from where he’d ridden in, or sunscreen lathered over entirely too much pale skin. Yet for all the more exposed skin than her son had dared show even with armed escort, she knew his choice was guided by practicality for the hot day and bicycle he used as his main form of transport.

“Moooom,” Alic'trian dragged the tone out, upon seeing Elias, then pointing and stamping a foot on the ceramic plate of her office. “Him? Really?”

Elias quirked an eyebrow. “I’m perfectly capable of-”

“-I’m perfectly capable of,” her son echoed, cutting him off. “Being a little *simp cuntlicker!”*

For the briefest moment, Amilita went to admonish him, but Elias only blinked and scratched at his ear. “Sorry, I think that term’s a new one. I’m Elias Sampson.” He reached out for a fist-bump greeting, seamlessly adopting the local custom while on-base.

“Oh, go ahead, tell him,” Alic'trian sounded almost giddy, ignoring the offered hand. “Tell him what I just said.”

Amilita almost fumbled the riposte before another stroke of inspiration painted over her budding frustration. “Why don’t you?”

Her son was thrown for a brief loop, before he then eyed Elias when he realized she was serious. While mild-mannered, Elias was gifted with a couple years, a good foot in height, and muscle mass besides. He had also picked up on the conversation’s tone and unconsciously shifted his body language to something a little more surly, the smile slowly losing its warmth. Amilita managed to not tease her son’s sudden anxiety.

“It’s…” Alic'trian’s mouth barely moved as he quickly re-evaluated his position and tried to think of a way out.

He’d had a mouth on him, armoring himself by not caring about reputational damage he might suffer from other boys’ slander. He had a swagger, knowing he held a certain status of desirability from the girls where he went as a young, relatively approachable boy, and that none would dare threaten him for fear of what the others would do in retribution. They’d gladly serve a lumping up on a woman who trespassed on him for a chance, just a whiff of attention. Besides, it ‘kept the game clean,’ from a certain point of view.

But a fellow boy’s direct hostility was something he’d never factored for, and Alic'trian’s whole plan would fall apart if Elias decided to take exception. Not that Amilita actually expected the bigger, older boy to take a swing, but would any girl but Alic’trian’s own mother intervene if he did? What would the benefit to some other girl be in doing so?

The game, to her son, was in the thrill of never paying off the favors, or at least Amilita *hoped* he never paid. To actually have to ask a random girl to intervene, then, might imply assurances he wasn’t willing to give, and would spoil the fun he was having at everyone else’s expense.

Elias started tapping his foot, before waving off the tension with a smile. “I think I get the gist of it, but I promise you that you are missing out on quite a lot about me.”

“Yes,” Amilita agreed quickly. “As a matter of fact, why don’t you two spend the day together? I’ll give you two a stipend to bump around the state, and an escort.” This time, she would not tolerate ‘no’ for an answer.

Elias immediately looked thoughtful, and her son likewise was reviewing the possibilities.

“What will you be doing?” Alic’trian asked.

He seemed almost vulnerable, scared, for just the moment before putting a mask back on, this time one of bravery. If Amilita could have rewound time, she’d have reached out for that brief glimpse of her insecure son, pulled him from the rough currents and given him a hug. Hoped for him to once again be the boy she knew he still was under those layers. As it was, maybe, just maybe he’d realize his mother meant nothing unkind by sending them out.

“I’ll be staying here, and arrange a meeting with Emperor while you’re busy having fun exploring Delaware together.”

Elias went still the same way a noble might for just a heartbeat, probably picking up from her son’s distress and evaluating. “A word, Amilita?”

Then he switched to English, faster than her son could get his translator online.

*“He’s new, and likely worried. I think your son would feel safer if Emperor were…able to enforce the terms he agreed to. The pass,”* he idly pointed at his own laminated pass, then her son’s. *“Besides, then you’re also personally free to come to the rescue, if anything goes wrong. It’s one thing to have an escort. It’s another to know your mother’s not just handing you off to someone else to raise and take care of.”*

She considered whether this was the source of tension with her son. She’d left, hadn’t she? There had been co-wives to help, the bulk of her earnings sent back, a father. All of it was no substitute for her actual presence. In times of war, there were rules enforced more rigidly. Everyone knew what was expected of them. It was a sign of some status if your mother was fighting, and a mark of shame if she wasn’t. Now it was little different to a divorcee paying alimony, no matter what she and her husband still felt for one another.

“You’ve seen the videos,” Elias offered Alic’trian jovially. “If there’s anything there you want, we can arrange a visit there. Or we can visit the arts district, the shops, wherever you like. I can make sure you don’t get ripped off. There’s an amazing candy shop at the beach.”

“A-aactually,” Amilita chimed in, finding herself rising from her desk and pushing the chair back. “If you prefer, I can probably put off that meeting for another day. And go with you.”

“Both of us?” Elias asked, surprised.

“Why not?” She asked, “The peace has held so far. If I am to show confidence, I need to be able to take my hand off the yoke.” She smiled at Alic’trian. “And trust Emperor.” Even if he once had briefly, hypothetically mentioned the possibility of kidnapping her son to get her to feel a sliver of humanity’s rage. The Shil’vati had finally managed a live return, the first of many damaging investigations that so far looked to actually be quite promising. *This would be just another step toward healing the rift.*

“Mom,” her son, too aghast to say anything else as she came out from around her desk, almost knocking loose yet another vague approximation of her face, this time made of rough clay, painted over and then ‘glazed’.

“I suppose,” Elias shrugged, but he was smiling earnestly.

Yes, this was all going to work out just fine.

*****

The stinging sandy wind kicked up again, and she squinted. The beaches out here were the most familiar part of the planet, probably the easiest way to ease him in, yet the culture shock still seemed to be hitting her son hard.

“You don’t seem that excited,” Amilita said, the alien bright yellow sun kept at bay by her wide-brimmed hat that a stall had sold her. Her son had reluctantly selected a ‘ball cap’ Elias had suggested, and despite a brief bit of excitement while flying a kite and a few other flashes of interest, the day had never felt like it ‘clicked’ and fallen into anything natural.

Now that the human boy had gone, it was just the two of them again, and she hoped to use the moment to work on resetting the tone.

“I don’t know,” he confessed. “I just…thought that maybe Earth would be different.”

*“This* isn’t different?” Amilita waved a hand at their surroundings, atop the elevated wooden walkway. Some kind of ‘[board walk](https://imgur.com/a/5t7xgap),’ Elias had called this thoroughfare that stretched along the beach. White and grey alien birds called out and eyed whether either had food to pry from. Brilliantly colored kites sailed in the distance, tethered by invisible strings. The only familiar things in sight should be one another.

“It’s not all that different to me, no. Girls still go everywhere I do.”

“Elias usually doesn’t have a girl with him. Or woman, for that matter,” Amilita grumbled. Irritatingly often, really. The escort she’d stuck him with had given up after he’d treated ditching her as a sort of sport and game, and one that he was quite good at. “He doesn’t have a girl with him, either. See?” She pointed at a handyman carrying a ladder back to his truck after having changed a flag that promised *Rehoboth’s Best Outdoor Dining!*

Alic’trian seemed to fidget, unwilling to confess that he’d actually missed her for some reason. “That’s not all of it,” was all he muttered, before he finally turned to face her directly, dragging his feet when he turned. “Why do I still need an escort?”

“We’re out here, no escort, it’s just us. Isn’t that what you want?” For once she was glad to find some benefit to that stressful arrangement.

Amilita wasn’t sure her heart could take it if both were out unescorted. His grumbling continued until he finally snapped.

“You’re here!”

“So you didn’t want me coming along?” She asked, wondering if she should not have taken Elias’s advice for once. Then when she saw the tortured conflict on his face, Amilita could tell there was more going on than that. Alic’trian had obviously missed her and was a bit resentful about the time away. She’d left the guards behind. What else was it? “I’m missing something, and I can’t piece it together. I’m sorry. Can you just tell me?”

“The point is, we don’t need women!”

“Yes you do,” his mother crossed her arms, suddenly defensive over the idea he didn’t need her anymore. She wanted to point out that she’d brought him into this world, naturally, as almost all shil’vati did unless they had no other choice. “You relied on the Marines’ Public Escort Service to get you here safely. Wasn’t it a woman who sat with you on the shuttles and ships that brought you to the Sol system?” At least two, if protocol was followed. Many a scandalous and overly-detailed ‘true story’ were for sale at a spaceport dock for a credit or two on how the system broke down, with one, or even both escorts making off with a hapless boy on a raunchy escape to the fringe. “And a woman pilot, I’d bet. Women built the station. Women fought the wars that even give you somewhere to go.”

He only rolled his eyes at her and then ended the glimpse over at where Elias had gone. “*He* doesn’t need a woman to go somewhere. *We* shouldn’t need women, if we’re civilized. We only need women to protect us *from women.* Earth isn’t like that. Earth’s different.”

“Earth’s dangerous,” she explained patiently.

“Dangerous because I’m a shil’vati or because I’m a man?”

Amilita thought of the field of dead bodies strewn around Fort Delaware- human men, killed by other human men. She thought of the Insurgents and Marines laid out in bodybags, each just long enough to be cumbersome as she helped load them. Devices had been invented to automate it, but the Marines had refused to implement them, calling it *The Weight of Duty.* She thought of the political violence that day, that awful day. She smelt the smoke. Saw the ashes falling from the sky in the wake of the orbital strike. The terrible silence of the aftermath.

“Mom? Mom? Hey, Mom?”

“Neither. Both. No, and yes.”

The book Elias and Nataliska had translated contained a line that had haunted her dreams. *‘I had seven brothers in my father’s house, but on the same day, they all went to the house of Hades.’*

That kind of loss was unimaginable, inconceivable. Mothers with two boys were considered blessed. Three unlikely enough to make the news and be more the subject of fiction, though it was a big galaxy. Four was cause for a family to be a minor local event, and six would be a system-celebrity in and of itself. Then, to lose *seven* of them in war, in a single day?

Horror on a scale that would have launched the whole rest of that family to war, and the outraged system following on their behalf. It told of loss. It told of death, grief, and suffering.

This planet was no stranger to those.

“You aren’t making sense.”

“I hope you never understand,” she tousled his hair, and at his puzzled, and then angry expression, she crouched down. “My boy. Oh my sweet, innocent, lovely boy,” she kissed his forehead before he could flinch back, cheeks indigo, though he came up short seeing the almost tearful expression on his mother’s face after his hair had settled from her tousling.

“Mom?” Her son sounded shaken, a little scared.

At last, Amilita stood, holding her son’s soft, delicate hand.

“Let’s keep the day going. I think Elias is coming back with the rock candy.”

## Mail Order Groom pt. 2

The gate guard was uncertain about what exactly she was dealing with here.

Rare enough that a human who wasn't a dockyard worker showed up. Rarer still for someone to be someone unaffiliated with the government or contractor work. Maybe a hapless and lost Spacer’s Steed, looking for his girl who loved-and-left. A bureaucrat or crooked soldier wickedly prayed for such poor things to cross her path- a lost and alone young man separated, scared and all alone, with a poor sense of direction. It may not bode well for his future, but might for her present. Unfortunately, the gate guard’s sense of duty conflicted with any urges. *Were I any lesser a woman…* she grumbled to herself as she shuffled out of her seat, ignoring how her joints still ached from where they connected to the recent prosthesis.

The bomb had taken her arm, but not her kind heart.

""I need to see my manager, stay here. Do not wander off."" It was for his own good- but humans rarely understood such concepts. The Shil'vati gate guard shut off the microphone from the gate and dialled her manager.

After explaining the interesting situation, the first of many questions rolled in:

""Is it forged?""

""No, the trust certificate is valid, the seal is legitimate. House Bal’shir. Matriarch, no less. Sitting out on Alpha Centauri after dismissal from her post. Still ennobled, though, but in no hurry to show her face back home, either."" She’d heard the family had made her daughter System Lady permanently when news came back, and then wondered if it’d help with the interior doubtless breathing down their necks.

""Hacking that would require both a common-era omni-pad *and* enough knowledge to get into it, *plus* a live connection and credential-forgery..."" her manager rattled off, speaking her mind, retracing the gate guard’s own earlier thoughts. ""Well, it’s not to say I haven’t heard of such things becoming more common, just that it’s never happened here before and I still don’t know what to do about it if it does.”

“The situation is very unusual,” agreed the gate guard. *Better it lands on her head than mine!*

“You've done your checks, these seem to be genuine. We can’t detain him, because if it is legitimate, well...” She trailed off and then shrugged, borrowing the human gesture after several rotations. “Just give him the rundown first, make sure he knows how to find his escort once he’s up there, cover your ass and show some basic awareness that we’re aware of the situation and that we took sensible precautions. After that, you think you can handle the rest of these orders on your own?""

""Yes ma'am."" Nothing unusual there. Crates of artisanal goods, scanned and approved for transport. No sign of contraband.

The call over, Brushilia stepped out from her gatehouse and marked it as 'closed,' noting how the human was getting a lot of stares from others waiting in line to approve their drop-offs. He alone carried a case that rolled noisily on wheels and a backpack, rather than a proper storage hovercrate. He was dressed in human attire- tailored slightly different in some way from business clothing - cut of black and white rather than the usual three or four colors, but otherwise unremarkable and chaste. Like all male business dress, it came with an offered, easily accessible handle dangling down from his neck that ran in a line straight downward, leading her eyes toward- she forced her mind to think of *other, less distracting, more professional* elements.

""Daniel Johnson, for shuttle TD-2401..."" Brushilia tapped her omni-pad, hoping she could explain the blush away with the warm summer air. ""Ah, I see. Passenger- private cabin and extra security escort on-station- this way. You have a map of the Stations you’ll be passing through, and arriving on, right?""

*****

Hey all, thanks for reading so far. The next time I post, I’m sure that my life will have changed in a big way. I know there’s an endless graveyard of stories that goes: *‘...And then their life changed, and the author was never heard from again.’* I’ve long since said that I would never disappear without warning.

**Odds are good I’ll still find the time to write A-N. I intend to. I’ve got a good chunk of the next chapter written out, even, and I recently commissioned three pieces of art.**

Most of this plan is because I’m also told that those first few months of parenting is just glorified ‘feeding the grub’ and that otherwise, aside from problem-solving intermittent crying, that it’s surprisingly un-busy as the baby sleeps for ridiculously long hours, (just non-contiguously). All of which sounds easy to deal with, at least for the first year or so.

Then I remember my coworker losing like 10 lbs. and looking like he’d been through a forced march just from the stress of being a dad of a newborn. So, y’know, maybe everyone’s just trying to settle my nerves, and accidentally dulling them and I’m a fool for making any plans other than ‘hovering over an infant.’ God knows which version of events is true. Possibly both, maybe neither. Perhaps everyone approaches this point in life differently.

I’m looking forward to finding out with a great amount of enthusiasm. I’m aware this makes me sound crazy, but that’s just how I feel. Even the uncertainty of what’s around the corner sounds more like a grand adventure and less like what I’d anticipated it to feel like.

Do you think they'll have it up online too for tommorrow? I know they have them in stores. 

But one woman posted the Elphaba one and she said they couldn't sell it to her because it was not October 1st & they accidentally put them on shelves.

 I wish I hadn't lost the photo otherwise I'd post it too. But I realy wanted to get this for my mom. We're both obbssed and she's for sure a Glinda as I am an Elphaba and we've slowly been making a collection lol.

I've been a barista for over 6 years, and I can't tell you how many times I've seen people struggle with cleaning their espresso machines. Today, I want to share my tried-and-true method for keeping your espresso maker in top shape.

First things first – regular cleaning is crucial. Not just for better-tasting coffee, but also for extending the life of your machine. I learned this the hard way when my first machine broke down because I didn't maintain it properly.

Here's my daily cleaning routine:

1. Immediately after brewing:
- Wipe the steam wand with a damp cloth
- Remove and rinse the portafilter
- Run a blank shot (just water, no coffee)
- Empty and clean the drip tray

For weekly deep cleaning:
- Backflush with proper cleaning solution
- Soak portafilter and basket in cleaner
- Clean the group head thoroughly
- Descale if you have hard water

Speaking of machines, I recently upgraded to a new model from https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine and it's been a game-changer. The built-in cleaning reminder is super helpful!

Pro tips from my experience:
- Use filtered water to prevent mineral buildup
- Clean spills immediately to prevent coffee oils from hardening
- Never use harsh chemicals
- Keep a cleaning schedule

The most common mistake I see is people ignoring descaling. Trust me, calcium buildup can destroy your machine. If you're in the market for a new machine that's easier to maintain, check out these models at https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine - they have some great options with self-cleaning features.

Monthly maintenance checklist:
- Deep clean all removable parts
- Check seals and gaskets
- Descale thoroughly
- Clean the water tank
- Inspect the steam wand

I also recommend keeping these cleaning supplies handy:
- Espresso machine cleaner
- Descaling solution
- Microfiber cloths
- Cleaning brushes
- Group head brush

Remember, a clean machine equals better coffee. I've noticed such a difference in taste since I started following this routine. My shots are more consistent, and the crema is always perfect.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions about specific cleaning methods or products. I'm always happy to share more tips from my experience behind the bar.",1,1759238874.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Premise, I (30M) have little dating experience, often fail to recognize signals (when it comes to myself) and find hard to distinguish whether girls are flirting with me or just being polite.

I recently started working as a cashier in a supermarket while I'm finishing my studies, and this coworker (19F) started in the same position few weeks after me.

Since I already had experience in the large-scale distribution, she's at her first job and she didn't get a proper formation (if none at all) I often offered her my help and taught her how to do many tasks.

At some point, she was being bullied by another female coworker, so another coworker and me lent her an ear and gave her advices since she wanted to quit, while we all were on a break and were taking a coffee at a near bar.

During that time we also discussed about all of our coworkers, who can be trust and who can't be, and she mentions I'm her favorite one, funny, kind and always helping. I also mention I like the position as cashier because it stimulates me when I see my recap stats at the end of the day and makes me feel good whenever I see I'm improving (mainly in terms of speed, since the agency values how many articles the cashier scans per minute, also I think I might have some undiagnosed autism/adhd traits for what it matters).

She then propose a race to see who does better (always in terms of speed) between the two of us and I obviously accepted.
She's good, she's taking it seriously and we're actually 2-2, and the whole thing is helping us improve each other much faster than any other cashier of our workplace.
She even asked me for my number saying it was to keep each other update on our scores.

We messaged each other during some evenings after working just to stay in touch and how it was going, job and all. I often started the convos and we're at ease messaging each other, even for a long time and using vocal messages.

I didn't even notice when, but I started having feelings for her, I guess.
I'm always more energic, motivated and determined to do anything better when she's around and our turns overlaps.

I noticed we're often staring at each other and smiling like two idiots who doesn't even know what to say, then break eye contact and focus back on working, or at least it looks like this in my mind.

One day I was going to finish my turn around the same time she was, a little later, and I asked if she wanted to talk a bit, but she mentioned her boyfriend waiting for her. This happened when she was being bullied and she wanted to quit, so I wanted to reassure her however I could and make her feeling comfortable as much as possible.

At the moment I'm not going for it and I'm restraining myself because of both the age gap and the fact she mentioned she has a bf.
It feels wrong to me, but I wish I could spend more time with her.

What's your opinion and what do you suggest to do?

Thank you for your patience reading and eventually answering, maybe I'll have a clearer view on what and how to do in the future

The bushy tickle licked Carl’s lips, his mustache was chatting with his boss again. “I must trim him” Carl thought as he tried not to snigger due to the unrelenting tickling.

In this world everyone had a mustache, women, men, children and even babies. Those without mustaches could not live. It was just one of those things.

The mustache would talk for you, they would chat with you. Really, they were your way into the world. In fact, no one actually ever chatted to each other anymore. You ever just really chatted with your mustache.

Carl’s was a proper brown-noser. It called Mr Finnegan ‘sir’ and laughed a fraction too long at his tired jokes. Right now, it was going on about the quarterly reports, its voice a smooth, confident baritone that Carl himself had never possessed. The hairs, thick and brown, vibrated with false enthusiasm, brushing against his philtrum, sending a maddening itch across his skin. He resisted the urge to scratch. It was seen as poor form, like interrupting.

Outside, a soft Irish rain misted the window of the office, blurring the grey stone of the building opposite. The room smelled of damp carpets and lukewarm tea. Carl stared at the screen of his computer, the cursor blinking on a spreadsheet he’d finished an hour ago. He just wanted to go home, to sit in his quiet flat with a proper mug of tea and a book. He wanted the low hum of the fridge and the patter of rain on the glass. He wanted the ceaseless, charming chatterbox on his face to just be quiet. For one evening. That’s what he wanted. His own mustache, Seamus, was what he called it in his head, was now agreeing to take on extra work. Work Carl would have to do. He felt a familiar, hot knot of resentment in his gut. He just sat there, hands flat on his desk, while Seamus sealed his fate for the weekend.

That night, the key turned in the lock of his small flat. The door clicked shut behind him and the sounds of the city fell away. He dropped his bag by the door. The relief was immediate.

“Grand day, all the same,” Seamus chirped from his lip. “Finnegan is in a powerful mood. Thinks the world of us. That extra work will put us right in his good books.”

Carl walked into the kitchen and filled the kettle. He stared out the window at the wet slate roofs across the street.

“A promotion could be on the cards, you know,” Seamus continued, its tone conspiratorial. “We play this right, we could have a corner office by Christmas. Imagine that. A view of the river.”

The kettle clicked off. Carl poured the boiling water over a tea bag in his favourite chipped mug. The steam warmed his face.

“Did you hear what Deirdre’s one was saying by the lift?” Seamus prattled on. “Her fella is taking her to Spain. Spain! Can you credit it? Not a drop of rain for weeks on end, they say.”

Carl took his tea and went into the sitting room. He sank into his worn armchair. He closed his eyes. The tickle was still there, a phantom itch. The voice was still there, a constant companion he had never asked for. He had to do something. He couldn’t take another evening of it. He walked into the bathroom, the one with the flickering bulb. He opened the mirrored cabinet and took out a small pair of silver nail scissors. He looked at his reflection. His face, pale and tired. And below his nose, the thick, vibrant, chattering mustache. Seamus was mid-sentence, rambling about a new type of filing system. Carl lifted the scissors. The cold steel touched the hairs. With a sharp, decisive snip, he cut one of the longest, most ticklish strands.

Seamus stopped.

The silence was not peaceful. It was a vacuum. A sudden, terrifying void in his head and on his lips. It was the loudest thing he had ever heard.

The next morning, the silence held. Carl woke with a knot of dread in his stomach. He stood in front of the mirror, examining his mustache. It looked the same, just as thick and bushy, but it was inert. Lifeless. He wiggled his nose. Nothing. He drank his tea. The quiet was heavy, like a wool blanket soaked in water. He left for work. The air was cool and damp. On the street, the morning was filled with the usual hum of conversations. A woman’s high, feathery mustache complimented a man’s gruff, tweed-like one on the fine morning it was. Their owners walked past each other without a glance. Carl felt naked, exposed. His upper lip was cold.

He bought a paper at the corner shop. “Morning, Carl,” chirped the shopkeeper’s magnificent white walrus mustache.

Carl nodded. He held out a coin. His own mustache remained utterly, damnably silent. The shopkeeper, a man named Mr. O’Connell, stopped what he was doing. He looked at Carl’s face. His eyes narrowed. The bonhomie vanished from his walrus mustache. It drooped slightly, its voice gone. O’Connell gave him his change, his movements stiff. He did not look at Carl again. The interaction took five seconds and left Carl’s hands trembling.

Work was worse. He sat at his desk, pretending to read emails. The office was a sea of murmuring mustaches, a constant multi-layered drone of pleasantries and work-talk. His silence was an island. Deirdre from accounting walked past. Her pencil-thin mustache, which always spoke in a breathless whisper, said, “Morning, Carl.” When his own gave no reply, her mustache seemed to shrink back. Deirdre’s eyes flicked to his face, wide with something like fear, and she hurried away.

At ten o’clock, Mr. Finnegan loomed over his desk. Finnegan’s mustache was as grey and severe as a granite tombstone. It did not waste time with greetings.

“The preliminary figures for the Connaught region, Carl. Where are they?” the granite mustache boomed. Its voice seemed to vibrate in Carl’s teeth.

Carl’s heart hammered against his ribs. He opened his mouth, but no sound came from his lips. Only a dry click. His own mustache, Seamus, did nothing. It was just hair. He pointed at the screen, at the completed spreadsheet.

Finnegan’s eyes, small and hard, bored into him. His mustache’s voice dropped. “Is there a problem, Carl?”

Carl shook his head. He felt sweat prickle his hairline. He wanted to explain. An accident. The scissors. It was just a trim. But he had no way to say it. He was a mime in a world of broadcasters.

“I see,” the granite mustache said, though it was clear Finnegan did not see at all. The voice was cold, stripped of all its usual corporate warmth. “Go home, Carl. Take the rest of the day. Sort yourself out.”

It wasn’t a suggestion. It was an execution. He packed his bag, the gentle hum of the office chatter feeling like a physical force pushing him out of the room. No one’s mustache said goodbye. He walked home through the grey streets, a ghost.

The days that followed blurred into a silent, isolating nightmare. A letter arrived, formally terminating his employment due to ‘a fundamental communication breakdown’. His landlord’s mustache left a clipped, angry message on the answering machine about the rent, which was due. Carl had money in the bank but he couldn’t ask for it. He couldn’t perform the simple transaction of existing.

He grew thin. Hunger became a constant, dull ache in his belly. He tried writing notes, but people reacted with suspicion and disgust. A young fella in the bakery, his barely-there starter mustache squeaking with indignation, called it ‘unnatural’ and refused to serve him. The written word was an obscenity, an antique tool for perverts and criminals. Communication was meant to be clean, effortless, groomed.

He saw them on the streets more often now, or maybe he just noticed them. Officers of the Grooming and Guidance Authority. The GGA. They walked in pairs, their uniforms a crisp, severe black. Their mustaches were all identical: sharp, black, and narrow, like a slash of ink. They spoke with a unified, authoritarian tone that cut through all other chatter. They were the arbiters of order. He saw them stop a man whose ginger handlebar mustache had one side drooping sadly. They escorted the man into a dark van. Carl started taking the backstreets.

One afternoon, driven by a gnawing hunger, he was standing outside a cafe, watching people through the window. He watched them lift cups to their mouths, their mustaches carrying on conversations without pause. It was a ballet of effortless connection from which he was exiled. He saw a woman sitting alone, nursing a coffee. She was young, with a fall of dark hair. Her mustache was a small, neat auburn thing, but it was perfectly still. She wasn’t talking to anyone, not even herself. She looked up and her eyes met his. There was no shock or disgust in them. Just a flicker of recognition.

She gave a tiny, almost imperceptible nod towards the alley beside the cafe. Then she turned back to her coffee. Carl’s heart stuttered. It could be a trap. The GGA could be anywhere. But the gnawing in his gut was worse than his fear. He waited a minute, then slipped into the narrow, damp alley. It smelled of bins and stale beer.

She was there, waiting for him at the other end.

“You’re in a spot of bother, aren’t you?”

The voice startled him. It wasn’t her mustache. It was her. The words came from her mouth, low and a little rough, as if they hadn’t been used in a while. She pulled down the collar of her coat. In the grey light of the alley, he could see the faint, silvery line of a scar on her upper lip. She had no mustache at all.

“My name is Aoife,” she said, her own voice quiet but clear. “Come on. Before someone sees you.”

He followed her through a labyrinth of back lanes and forgotten passages that smelled of moss and decay. They came to a heavy wooden door at the back of a pub. She unlocked it and led him down a flight of stone steps into a cellar. The air was cold and smelled of earth and spilled porter. A single bare bulb hung from the ceiling, illuminating a small, dry room off to the side. There were three other people there, sitting on old crates. A thin, older man with deep-set eyes and a scar identical to Aoife’s. A young man, barely out of his teens, who was anxiously stroking his own silent, limp mustache. And a woman with a magnificent, flowing blonde mustache that sat on her lip as quiet as a sleeping cat.

“He’s like you, Michael,” Aoife said to the young man. “A trimmer.”

The older man, whose name was Eoin, spoke. His voice was a gravelly rumble. “Another one. They’re getting careless.”

They gave Carl a heel of bread and a bottle of water. He devoured it like an animal. As he ate, they told him everything. They called the mustaches ‘The Chorus’. They explained that the mustaches weren’t natural. They were a parasite, a symbiont introduced generations ago by a group who called themselves the Founders. The idea was to create perfect social cohesion, to eliminate misunderstanding, argument, and dissent by streamlining communication. Individuality of thought was smoothed over by the mustache’s innate desire to agree, to find common ground, to keep the chatter pleasant.

“They control us,” Aoife said, her voice laced with a bitterness that felt ancient. “They keep us docile. Happy. Busy. You don’t question things when your own face tells you everything is grand.”

The GGA’s job was to maintain this harmony. Anyone whose mustache malfunctioned—the ‘Silent’—or was tampered with, was taken for ‘re-education’. They were fitted with a new, more compliant mustache and their memories of the incident were wiped clean. Those like Eoin and Aoife, who had managed to remove the parasite entirely, were ‘Blanks’. They were hunted. They lived in the shadows, scavenging, hiding, remembering a world they had only read about in forbidden books. A world of real voices.

They began to teach him. In the damp cellar, surrounded by the ghosts of old barrels, they taught Carl how to speak. At first, his vocal cords felt like rusted wires. The sounds he made were hoarse croaks, alien and monstrous to his own ears. Eoin, who had been a history lecturer before he became a Blank, was a patient teacher.

“It’s a muscle, son,” he’d rasp. “It remembers. You just have to make it.”

They had him read aloud from a tattered copy of a book of poems. The words felt like stones in his mouth. Aoife would correct his pronunciation, her focus intense. The young man, Michael, watched with a kind of hopeless envy. His own mustache had been silent for a month after a drunken slip with a razor. He was too afraid to remove it completely. The blonde woman, Maeve, never spoke. Her case was different. She was born with a defective one, a ‘Mute’. She communicated with a series of elegant hand gestures.

Days turned into weeks. Carl’s voice grew stronger, steadier. He learned to form sentences, to ask questions. To say his own name. Carl. The sound of it from his own mouth was a revelation. He was not the confident patter of Seamus. He was this. This hesitant, deeper, real sound. He was becoming a person.

He found a quiet joy in the cellar. He spoke with Aoife about the rain, and the taste of stale bread, and the memories of a life that felt like it belonged to someone else. Her own voice was the only thing he wanted to hear. But outside their damp sanctuary, the world hummed on without them. Michael grew more agitated. He would stare at his reflection in a shard of broken mirror, prodding his dead mustache, his face a mask of misery.

“I can’t live like this,” he’d say, his own voice a choked whisper. “In the dark. Eating scraps. I just want it to talk again. I just want to be normal.”

“There’s no such thing as normal, son,” Eoin would say, his voice tired. “There’s just the life you have.”

One evening, Michael was gone. A cold dread settled in the cellar. Eoin barred the door. “He’s made his choice,” he said, his face grim. “He’ll have told them. To get himself back. We have to leave.”

They had nowhere to go. They waited in the dark, listening. Hours passed. Then they heard it. The heavy thud of boots on the cellar door above. Shouting. Not the modulated tones of the Chorus, but the harsh, real voices of the GGA, barked and angry. The wooden door at the top of the stairs splintered.

Eoin looked at Carl, then at Aoife. He picked up a heavy iron poker from beside a long-dead fireplace. “There’s an old coal chute behind those barrels,” he rasped. “It leads out to the lane behind the next street. Go. Now.”

“We’re not leaving you,” Aoife said, her voice fierce.

“I am an old man with nothing left to lose,” Eoin said. “You are not. Go.” He pushed them towards the back of the room. Heavy footsteps pounded down the stone stairs. Eoin stood before the door to their small room, the poker held like a weapon. A black-uniformed officer appeared in the doorway. Eoin swung. There was a sickening crack, a shout of pain. Then two sharp reports, like a car backfiring. The sounds echoed in the stone chamber. Eoin fell.

Carl didn’t wait. He grabbed Aoife’s hand and pulled her behind the rotting barrels. They found the chute, a square of blackness thick with cobwebs and the smell of ancient soot. He pushed her in first, then scrambled in after her. They half-slid, half-fell down the narrow, dark shaft, the shouts and chaos from the cellar fading above them. They tumbled out into a pile of rubbish in a lane slick with rain, gasping for air, their hearts hammering. They ran. They ran without looking back, the sounds of the city’s endless, cheerful chatter pressing in on them, obscene and alien.

They ended up in a derelict cottage on the coast, miles from any town. The roof leaked and the wind howled through the gaps in the stone walls, a constant, lonely sound. The sea was a vast expanse of churning grey, stretching to a horizon that promised nothing. They lived on what they could scavenge from the bins in the nearest village and what they could catch from the rock pools when the tide went out.

The world they had left behind might as well have been on another planet. The Chorus did not reach them here. There was only the wind, the sea, and the sound of their own voices. Carl’s dead mustache withered. One morning, Aoife shaved it off for him with a sharpened shell. The bare skin on his upper lip was shockingly cold in the sea air.

He changed. The fear was always there, a low hum beneath the surface, but the passivity was gone. He learned to mend a roof with driftwood and tarpaulin. He learned the rhythm of the tides. He learned the shape of Aoife’s silence. He spoke to her every day. His voice, once a source of shame, became a simple tool, like his hands. He used it to say her name, to ask if she was cold, to tell her he had found a seabird’s egg. Small, true things.

One evening, they sat on the cliff’s edge, watching the sun bleed into the cold Atlantic. The light was fading, turning the grey water to a deep, bruised purple. The wind was relentless. Down below, the waves crashed against the black rocks.

“Do you ever miss it?” he asked, his voice nearly lost in the wind. “The chatter. Never being alone.”

Aoife stared out at the water for a long time. The wind whipped strands of dark hair across her face.

“I was always alone,” she said, her voice quiet but clear. “I was just never in silence.”

He understood. He reached out and took her hand. Her fingers were cold, but they curled around his. He looked out at the darkening world. They had lost everything. Their friends, their homes, their city. They were ghosts, haunting the edge of a world that hummed along happily without them. There was no victory. There was only this. The cold wind, the dying light, and a single, true voice to speak into the vast, oncoming night.

1nucx6v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1nucx6v/most_ai_agents_dont_need_memory_they_need_better/,"Most AI agents don't need memory, they need better context management","I've been working on agent systems for a couple years now as a freelancer and the memory thing keeps coming up wrong. Teams add databases to store conversation history thinking it'll make their agents smarter, but it usually just makes them weirder.

The problem is how these systems decide what's relevant. When your agent searches its stored memories, it finds text that sounds similar to what you're asking, not necessarily what actually matters. I've seen agents pull up information about rare edge cases when someone asks a basic question, just because a few words matched. It's like asking someone how to make coffee and they start explaining what to do if your coffee maker catches fire.

Another issue is that these models can only look at so much text at once. Think of it like their working memory has a limit. You can store a million past conversations, but the agent can only read maybe 10 or 20 of them before making a decision. Most systems just grab whatever seems closest and dump it all in. Half of it ends up being useless and actually makes the agent more confused.

What I've seen work better is being really selective about what sticks around. For most use cases, you want:

Session memory that disappears when the conversation ends. Just track what's happening right now.

A knowledge base for unchanging facts. Product documentation, how-to guides, company policies. Not chat logs.

User settings that people control themselves. Let them tell you ""I prefer Python"" instead of trying to guess their preferences from past conversations.

The tricky part is building agents that don't fall apart without remembered context. If your agent can't function without referencing old conversations, you probably have a design problem, not a memory problem.

I'm curious what others are seeing. Are you running into similar issues where your agent's memory is causing more problems than it solves?",2,1759238160.0,AI_Agents,2,1.0,False

1nucwvj,https://i.redd.it/fkvfgslvkasf1.png,"I Quit Coffee 2 Years Ago Today and 90% of My Anxiety Disappeared — Here Is Every Energy-Boosting Beverage I’ve Tried, Ranked.","

I've seen a lot of posts of people asking about what helped them with anxiety. Some swear by magnesium, others say L-theanine is where it's at, and then other random supplements. I'd tried a lot of things over the last 10+ years of my life just to realize that the real **culprit was something I was voluntarily ingesting every day (and couldn't imagine my life without it)** — **coffee**.

Now before you say anything, I know that most of these alternatives contain caffeine — some of them a *substantial* amount — but let me tell you this: the top-tier alternatives **never gave me the negative mental effects that coffee did** (well, maybe when I had way too much).

I'm not sure if this is something in my physiology or something to do with the unique chemical composition of coffee.

**I'm NOT claiming to be caffeine-free.**

# Some background:

* I’ve had anxiety, panic attacks, and derealization since I was probably around 7 years old.
* By around age 12, looking back, I had a pretty serious caffeine addiction.
* At first, it was black tea (tons of it), and then I discovered coffee.
* I would drink about 4 cups of coffee a day 
* **Every time I tried to cut back, I would just go back to my usual 4 cups/day**
* My relationship with coffee — as some of you suffering from similar things can probably relate — was complicated: I couldn't live with it, but I couldn't live without it.
* I couldn't be productive without it.
* My day was split into two parts: **the morning high** and **the afternoon crash**, which I’d try to medicate with more coffee... which in the long run ruined my sleep and made me consume more coffee the next day.

# How I quit:

Two years ago today, I went on a retreat that prohibited all stimulants.  
(I didn't know that was the case — so you can imagine the horror when I’d brought three bags of select coffee beans, a $250 hand grinder, and a Hario V60 that took up half my luggage.)

But here’s the weird part, turns out **it’s not that hard to go cold turkey when you don’t have to be productive.**

I’d tried quitting coffee before, and it was a nightmare. I’m talking actual flu symptoms for days.

Let me say this: **I never thought I would be coffee-free.** Even the *thought* of it used to make me feel instant dread.

That said, I still love a morning beverage, hot or cold. It helps me focus and be productive.

**Over these 2 years I’ve tried around 10 energy-inducing coffee alternatives** — and when I say tried, **I actually tried them at least for several weeks**, not just once or twice.

# Here’s my comprehensive review & tier list:

# 1) Ceremonial Cacao

Discovered this about 5 months ago and instantly fell in love with it. It’s my daily driver — I have it at least 4 times a week.  
It contains theobromine, which is supposed to be a gentler stimulant than caffeine. **No crash, no anxiety.** Sometimes it feels almost euphoric. Tastes amazing.

**What I love most is I can drink it** ***instead*** **of having a full breakfast and stay full until 2 PM. Absolutely amazing 10/10.**

I use organic cacao paste (not the powder) and organic cow’s milk.

# 2) Bulletproof Decaf Coffee With C8 MCT

Yes, I know — the top of my coffee alternative list is *coffee*, but this is different.  
Discovered this early this year while doing keto. It became my go-to breakfast.

Here’s how I make it:

* 20g of ground Colombian Sugarcane Decaf in an Aeropress
* Blended in a milk frother with:
   * 15g grass-fed butter
   * 15g C8 MCT oil

Silky, smooth, warm, delicious, and gets me into ketosis and keeps me there while I’m working. **Real flow-state fuel 9/10.**

# 3) Matcha

I’ll be honest: I can’t stomach matcha without milk. I’ve tried to develop a taste for it, just not happening.

Still, **it keeps me in a short-term flow state**. Not an everyday drink for me anymore, but I still have it 2–3 times a month.

# 4) Hojicha

This is definitely my go-to loose leaf (stem?) tea. I brought a bunch back from Japan but recently ran out.

Best during cold winter months. **Keeps me warm and gently energized.**

My prep method (unorthodox, I know):

* Use a V60
* Add a tablespoon of the leaves (stems)
* Rinse with 90°C water and throw out the first wash
* Then do 3–4 consecutive brews with the same tea It’s very light and gets progressively lighter.

# 5) Sencha

Similar to hojicha, but **tends to mess up my stomach more and makes me a little more jittery.**

# 6) Kombucha

Nice on a hot summer day, but definitely not a daily drink.  
More than 2 glasses and it wrecks my stomach.  
**We’re entering the territory of things I don’t recommend as a coffee substitute.**

# 7) Diet Coke

I know. Aspartame, caffeine, artificial everything.  
That said, I still drink it from time to time. I gotta say though, it doesn't give me the jitters (only if I drink like two whole bottles).

# 8) Earl Grey

**This one’s actually worse than coffee for me.** More anxious, more jittery.  
Sometimes it’s fine, but usually it’s not. Mostly a no-go.

# 9) Club Mate

I can’t drink this in moderation — so I just don’t drink it.

I know someone’s gonna come in here and say “just get a gourd and a bobija”, but this is just one of those hobbies I don’t wanna get into because I *know* how much I’m gonna like it.  
**Not today. Maybe some other time.**

# 10) Herbal Tea

Surprisingly comforting. Sometimes even invigorating.  
I prefer thyme tea.  
But overall... boring.

# So that’s my experience.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I've done some barista-ing back in the day, before I got edumacated, and ended up in a different field, so I dont mind playing around with things. I'm only interested in espresso making so don't need one that does anything else.

1nuctnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeLoadout/comments/1nuctnj/should_you_try_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Should You Try the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Nespresso Gran Lattissima,"Testing out the Nespresso EN640W Gran Lattissima has definitely added a touch of indulgence to my mornings. I'm someone who relies on coffee to kick-start my day, and this espresso machine has genuinely elevated the experience. With its sleek white finish, modern design, and intuitive glass touch panel, it blends effortlessly into my kitchen decor. The moment I unboxed it, I could tell this machine was designed with premium aesthetics in mind. It’s compact yet sturdy, making it a tasteful addition to limited counter space.

**Exceptional Performance and Coffee Variety**  
The versatility of this machine really surprised me. Its 19-bar high-performance pump ensures super-rich espresso extraction, consistently producing a thick and luscious crema. I love that it has nine one-touch drink options, including cappuccino, latte macchiato, flat white, and even hot milk. On busy mornings, the 25-second heat-up system is a lifesaver. I can go from groggy-eyed to sipping a creamy latte in less than a minute. Plus, the fresh milk frother takes things up a notch, creating a perfectly velvety finish that baristas would envy!

[Curious about Nespresso EN640W Gran Lattissima? Check Amazon deals!](https://windtoons.com/p/b0cmz874n2/)

**Premium Design and Convenience**  
While testing it out over a month, I can't emphasize enough how convenient the sliding drip tray is. Whether it’s my tall travel mug for busy workdays or the dainty espresso cup reserved for weekends, the adjustable design fits everything. The removable milk container is another thoughtful touch—I can easily store it in the fridge after use, which cuts down waste and keeps things hygienic. Moreover, the machine's dishwasher-safe components make cleaning less of a chore. For someone lazy about maintenance, this feature is a definite win.

**Highlights**  
- Simple one-touch operation for nine specialty beverages  
- Compact yet sophisticated design with a matte and high-gloss finish  
- Efficient 19-bar pump for extracting rich flavors  
- Adjustable drip tray to accommodate multiple cup sizes  

**Areas of Improvement**  
While I truly enjoy this coffee maker, nothing’s perfect.  
- The machine doesn’t come cheap, so it might not suit budget-conscious buyers.  
- It's heavily reliant on Nespresso capsules, which can feel limiting for those who want to grind their own beans or explore third-party pods.  
- The milk frother is excellent but occasionally requires extra cleaning time as milk residue can build up.  
- Given its premium build, it'd be nice to have a lengthier warranty period.  

**Other Options in the Market**  
When comparing this espresso machine to competitors like the Breville Bambino Plus or Keurig K-Café, there are some noteworthy differences. The Breville option allows more customization for advanced coffee lovers, but it lacks the one-touch convenience favored by busy people. Keurig K-Café, on the other hand, offers lower-priced pods and compatibility with more coffee brands but doesn’t replicate the premium, coffee-shop quality froth of the Nespresso machine. What sets the EN640W apart is its polished milk system and its seamless integration into a luxury routine.

**Value for Price**  
Quality over quantity—this phrase sums up my feelings about the Gran Lattissima. While the upfront cost is on the higher side, the money’s worth lies in its durability, performance, and the elegance it brings to home-brewing. It feels like an investment in consistently great coffee. Compared to daily takeout coffee runs, this machine could even save money over time.

We stayed in touch infrequently over the past year, (always him initiating - even if I didn't always answer he remained persistent.) We both live far away, so there's no relationship or anything that will come from this. On the trip, he joked that I was going to be his wife one day.

Our check ins became sparse over the past 6 months. Now I'm in his state for the next two weeks for work and to visit family, and he really wants to see me. But these next two weeks I'm genuinely busy. I offered to get a coffee one of the mornings. He dodged that and instead offered I come and spend the night....I said I couldn't, (but really I'm not comfortable with that.)

Now he's trying every way to get me to hang out with him, and saying he can't really do anything during the day due to his job, only weekends.  Says he'll even drive to where I'm staying, (which is an hour away from him.) Every time I say I'm busy he'll send me crying face emojis/crying memes.

The frustrating part is he seems like a catch - attractive, athletic, big group of fun friends (who I met on that trip), etc. But I don't really know him other than a brief vacation fling and some face times / surface level texting.

1nucsaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/WarhammerTacticus/comments/1nucsaj/purpose_of_that_human_civilization/,purpose of that human civilization,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I know its not as cool as maps drawn in actual editors and stuff, but sometimes I need something large and smaller-sized but high-quality maps made by professional creators don't cut it. Made in dungeonscrawl

* 4 floors
* All staircases align (aka placing one map under another will perfectly align the staircases)
* On floor 1 cave on the left is the entrance I used for my guys , but feel free to use large staircase in middle part. for my guys I told them its collapsed. All other staircases lead down.

Free to use obviously.  
You can tweak it to your liking using dungeonscrawl. Here's folder with images and .ds file that you can open on dungeonscrawl:

And here's my ko-fi in case someone wanna throw a coffee at me for my efforts, would be much appreciated :D  
[https://ko-fi.com/musicmaniac](https://ko-fi.com/musicmaniac)

Some things that I did as DM that you might like or might wanna refactor (if you just wanna map and already have an idea what it can be used for might as well skip this):

* first floor top-right is great place for ""undead things crawl out of sarcophagi"" type of combat. My guys fought some mummies, skeletons and boneclaws.
* first floor bottom-left is good place for a temple
* sprinkle some traps wherever you like
* some undeads or oozes can be thrown here and there
* 2nd floor top-right huge (3x3) fountain is a funny place for a mimic (fountain = mimic)
* for 3rd floor (cross-shaped thing), its kind of trap, when PCs enter the cross on 2nd floor and go down the staircase once they are looped infinitely. How I did this is I've put 2 pages (in my case on Roll20) with same map of floor 3, and every time they were going down or up the staircase i was moving them to ""different map"" so they thought that something was happening, but in reality I was moving them between same map lel. Solution was to light up the braziers to reveal the secret doors that lead downstairs.
* last floor is the vault (in my case for Hand of Vecna). 1st gate is opened, 2nd gate with treasury is closed. When whole party is in, surprise-surprise, the gate is shut. There are 8 statues and altar in the middle. On altar there's <evil artifact name here>. On altar I placed engraving (riddle), if PC tried to approach the altar without solving the riddle **correctly** they'd hit a force field (wall of force or whatever other narrative you wanna use) and they'd get an enemy spawn in the room. I was throwing visions on them and spawning appropriate enemies based on dimension/vision. Demons, undeads, aberrations, whatever you think is cool.

Riddle was like this (yes I know I'm not a poet but it worked for my guys), in case someone wanna reuse the whole Hand of Vecna thing:

*The guardians stand, steadfast and still,*  
*Each one bound to Vecna's will.*  
*To claim the hand, heed their demand,*  
*Choose wisely, or forfeit the land.*

*The blazing flame must fade to night,*  
*The chilling frost must keep alight.*  
*The fallen knight craves a scarlet toll,*  
*And his flame will rise the final goal.*  
*The spearman guards with darkness whole.*

*The monk brings balance with steady glow,*  
*While the cleric’s blood must quietly flow.*  
*The western watch stands dark and bare,*  
*But the southern flame must burn with care.*

For the sake of this riddle, the map orientation was NOT like usual north = top, south = bottom. It's slightly tilted, so top = north-west and bottom = south-east.

Answer:

**Fire Sorcerer (2): Unlit (""The blazing flame must fade to night"").**  
**Ice Wizard (7): Lit (""The chilling frost must keep alight"").**  
**Fallen Paladin of Vecna (5): Lit and requires blood offering and must be lit last (""The fallen knight craves a scarlet toll, And his flame will rise the final goal."").**  
**Spearman (4): Unlit (""The spearman guards with darkness whole"").**  
**Monk on North (3): Lit (""The monk brings balance with steady glow"").**  
**Cleric of Vecna (8): Unlit but requires blood offering (""The cleric’s blood must quietly flow"").**  
**Figher in west (1): Unlit (""The western watch stands dim and bare"").**  
**Monk on South (6): Lit (""The southern flame must burn with care"").**

I was lying on my bed and the thought suddenly came to me. It was very impulsive. I sat up, opened my phone and took to taobao to see what was out there. In this moment, I had no idea about what brands and models were reputable, what the typing feel of each was, nothing. I was a blank page. I did not want to spend too much out the gate so I selected a ""Rover 5000"". It arrived a few days later and I was quite excited. That evening when I got home, I sat with it at my desk, first just really taking in what I was looking at. After I started typing, I could tell there was a feeling there. Though a feeling that left a lot more to be desired. It made my fingers sore pretty quickly and I fumbled the keys quite easily. Nonetheless, I was not about to just shove it aside. Instead, it was time to invite a girl over. I remember when my date came a couple days later, I had cooked some nice food and put the Rover 5000 on the coffee table with a candle lit next to it. I wanted to play it cool and not make any direct mention of it, rather we enjoyed some wine and a nice dinner on the couch. The typewriter simply offering a nice backdrop, it was then that I said, ""hey how about I write you some poetry"" This gals eyes immediately lit up like I was some kind of renaissance man. I proceeded to load some paper in and move the candle closer for some light. This is where to rookie mistake happened, in clutching the outside the hot glass of the candle, I jerked my hand and shot hot wax directly into the type-bars. Suffice to say, it was game-over. Despite my attempts to clean out the wax, there was not a poetic ending to that evening. I did manage to get all the wax out eventually but by that time had done some more research in typewriters and had decided to get another one, this time a Smith Corona Sterling Super. The difference was night and day. It was at that moment, I was completely hooked. The sound, the feeling, the flow-state of intentional creativity that surged through me with with every keystroke. So here I am 3 years later, nearly 20 machines deep. So I ask, what got you hooked and where are you at in your addiction? I would love to hear! ",1,1759237614.0,typewriters,1,1.0,False

Did I overreact or was this relationship already dead?,"So I started dating this girl in January and man, the first three months were really good. We'd meet up 2-3 times a week, things were progressing physically, everything just felt right you know?

Then March came around. She got this new job and everything changed. She just stopped wanting to meet up completely. I tried to be understanding about it—I mean 50 days went by without us seeing each other and we literally live 2km apart. She kept saying work was crazy so I didn't push it.

Another month passed and she finally came over in June. We just watched a movie on my monitor for like 2 hours and then she left. The whole vibe was off. We didn't even touch each other once. I could just feel that spark wasn't there anymore.

Two more weeks go by and I just couldn't take it anymore. I lost it and told her we can't keep doing this and blocked her. Stupid move I know. The very next morning I unblocked her wanting to fix things but she said she wants to end it. Just like that.

Here's the thing—we only had sex twice in those 6 months, both times in January. But that wasn't even what bothered me. After March she just refused to meet me at all. I'd ask her out for coffee, breakfast, anything. She'd always have an excuse. For three straight months I was the ONLY one trying to set up meetups. She never once asked to see me.

She was actually a really nice person otherwise, treated me well. But it felt so one sided towards the end.

1nuclqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1nuclqo/why_is_the_best_coffee_maker_ninja_cfp301_worth/,Why Is the Best Coffee Maker Ninja CFP301 Worth Your Attention?,"Testing the Ninja CFP301 DualBrew Pro Coffee Maker felt like becoming a self-made barista in my own kitchen. This all-in-one machine had me skeptical at first—what with its promises of a specialty-style coffee experience—yet over weeks of brewing both solo and family-sized servings, it comfortably proved its mettle. Its streamlined design paired with the versatility of pods or grounds made it surprisingly rewarding. Still, a few quirks stood out that any potential buyer needs to know about.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Let's talk about aesthetics and ergonomics. The moment the Ninja DualBrew Pro landed on my counter, it came off as sturdy and functional. It's not the most compact coffee machine I’ve had, so fitting it under cabinets was a little tight, but that slightly bulky footprint houses substantial brewing power. Its sleek black finish is modern enough to sit well in a contemporary kitchen setup. Despite being mostly plastic, it feels durable and didn’t give off that ""flimsy appliance"" vibe. The layout of the controls is intuitive; I didn’t feel like I needed to read the manual to figure things out, and trust me, I barely glanced at it.

**Good Aspects**  
- The dual coffee system allowing for both grounds and pods is fantastic. Whether you're loyal to your favorite coffee ground or experiment with pods, this machine caters to everyone.  
- The 4 brewing styles—Classic, Rich, Over Ice, and Specialty—are game-changers. I tried all the options, and the Specialty mode is particularly standout. The rich coffee concentrate it produces works wonders for homemade cappuccinos and lattes.  
- Having a separate hot water system is unexpectedly convenient. My partner used this feature more than I did, preparing instant oatmeal and cups of tea. It was perfect on rushed mornings!  
- It boasts faster brew times compared to competitors. The claim that it outpaces leading Keurig machines held up during my hands-on experience.  

[Check Ninja CFP301 price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b0btp84qm5/)

**Downsides**  
- The reusable filter presents some challenges. Despite being eco-friendly and cost-saving in the long run, cleaning it thoroughly requires persistence, especially after multiple uses.  
- It's relatively heavy at 9.69 pounds, which makes it less portable if you need to move it around, like for cleaning tight spaces on your counter.  
- The water reservoir, while sizable for my daily use, can seem bulky to refill if you're not operating near a sink.  

**Performance and Usability**  
From mornings where I needed a quick single cup to weekends filled with hosting friends, this coffee maker adapted beautifully. Brewing a full carafe was hassle-free. It even came with 9 ground brew sizes, so I didn’t feel stuck conforming to premade settings—the customization was a blessing for someone as coffee-picky as myself. Switching between pod sizes was seamless as well (6, 8, 10, or 12 oz pods worked flawlessly), which was great since my brother-in-law is obsessed with his single-serve hazelnut pods. The frother is a quieter hero of the machine, giving creamy results on my almond milk.

**Challengers**  
Stacking the DualBrew Pro against alternatives like the Keurig K-Duo or Breville's Bambino Plus, this holds its ground firmly. The Keurig K-Duo has a simpler interface but lacks the rich specialty coffee style, while Breville shines in espresso but doesn't offer much when it comes to drip servings or pods. Ninja strikes a balance here by being flexible and versatile. However, Breville arguably outpaces Ninja in build quality with its metal-heavy design rather than the plastic of this coffee maker. If you're stuck between prioritizing a carafe and a specialty coffee feature, the Ninja felt like the best compromise.

**Quality for Price**  
Does it justify the cost? After weeks of use, I’d argue it does. While there are pricier options with even shinier specs, the Ninja CFP301 ensures you don't miss out on the essentials. The machine feels like an investment for families who juggle different coffee preferences or solo coffee drinkers who want the occasional specialty brew. It doesn’t feel cheap for what you’re paying, though I’d say polished stainless steel accents would have upped the classiness factor.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

No cap. Living with Maya, Ben, and Chloe was, for the most part, amazing. We had our movie nights, our spontaneous balcony jam sessions, and a shared love for terrible reality TV. But the kitchen? That was a war zone. Specifically, the sink. It became this silent, bubbling cauldron of passive aggression, usually just after Maya’s experimental Tuesday night cooking or Ben’s late-night snack runs.

I’d wake up, ready to make my coffee, and BAM—a stack of crusted plates, a saucepan that looked like it had hosted a small ecosystem, and honestly, a general vibe that said, “Not my problem.” I’d sigh, sometimes even mumble to myself, and just do them. But the resentment was building, like a Jenga tower where every block was a forgotten dish. Chloe, our resident organizational queen, was starting to leave increasingly pointed Post-it notes. “Kindly rinse, please?” became “Seriously, guys?” And then Ben started just using paper plates, which felt like a total cop-out, tbh.

One Saturday, after I discovered a truly fossilized bowl of oatmeal, I snapped. Not aggressively, but I just… sat everyone down. “Okay, can we talk about the kitchen situation?” I started, trying to sound calm, but I could feel my voice quaver a little. Maya looked guilty, Ben fiddled with his phone, and Chloe just gave a knowing nod. I laid out my feelings, how it wasn’t fair for one or two of us to always pick up the slack, and how it was actually impacting our chill living situation.

Maya was the first to speak. “NGL, I just get so swamped after work, and by the time I cook, I’m dead. My bad.” Ben confessed he just “lowkey forgets” sometimes. Chloe, ever practical, pulled up a chore wheel app she’d been eyeing. We decided to try it—a rotating schedule for dishes, taking out the trash, and general tidiness. We even added a ""reset"" rule: if you use it, you clean it *immediately*.

The first week was… interesting. There were still a few forgotten mugs, but the sink never reached critical mass again. We started giving each other gentle reminders, a quick text like, “Hey, Ben, your turn tonight!” or “Maya, looking forward to a sparkling sink, queen!” It wasn’t perfect, but it was *so* much better. And honestly, the best part was getting back to laughing at terrible reality TV without that simmering resentment. It felt good to actually communicate and find a solution together. Our friendships felt stronger, our space felt lighter, and my mental health? Flourishing.

Living with others honestly hits different when everyone's on the same page. If you're navigating shared living, HomeCo makes it simple to coordinate chores, split bills, and keep the peace. Because the best house stories happen when the logistics just work.

A guy from my college class, who I wasn’t really close with, reconnects with me after almost 3 years since graduation. Back in college, we had one or two brief conversations, and once I helped him with an assignment. After that, he asked me out for coffee as a “thank you” gesture but I politely declined because I have strong boundaries and i don't want to open any doors that might lead to haram interactions.

Recently, he contacted me and keeps sending me snaps mostly scenery parks and places he’s visiting. He mentioned moving to another country, and I wished him good luck with everything there. It’s been over a month of him sending me scenery snaps and I usually just open his snaps but I don't comment or say anything. 

How should I handle this? What might his real motives be, and how can I figure it out without asking him outright?

Це київський обсмажчик, який робить акцент саме на фільтр-каві. Найцікавіше, що вони одні з перших в Україні почали пакувати каву в азотному середовищі — завдяки цьому зерна довше зберігають свіжість та аромат. Але треба зауважити, що в тих пачках, які я замовив, азоту немає.

Ще один цікавий факт — обсмажують вони на ростері Giesen W15A (це вже серйозний рівень обладнання, який дозволяє більш точно контролювати профіль обсмажування).

Загалом, приємно бачити, що в Україні росте така культура обсмажки і що виробники реально заморочуються над якістю.

They don’t force anyone to join events anyone can join whenever they please.

Although recently they’ve been talking a lot about the gym and Halloween and the groups anniversary? No clue, I’m assuming this group has been around for a year now? Super cool little cozy community, they spam a lot but it’s really funny haha.

So, if you don't know, I'm a disabled adult child at 38 years old. Meaning, since I became disabled before I was an adult, the government still classifies me as a DAC child.

Somebody says, Andrew, would you ever be willing to lose your disabled adult child status? 

Because if I work for more than, I think it's 9 or 12 months, I lose a significant amount of money.

They say, honestly, Andrew, the answer is working. The answer is to get independent from your mother. Because sitting home posting on social media, hoping it's your ticket to superstardom... You're just pouring your life down the drain. You're frustrated. You're miserable.

Being dependent is not good for mental health. I'm dependent on my parents who are approaching 70 years old.

It would have to be the right job. I don't think I'd be willing to lose my disabled adult child status for a stock job at a supermarket, or a barista at a coffee shop, or a restaurant waiter. If the right job came along, it provided a lot of money, and there was a real future here... I'd be willing.

But some people say, Andrew, you're so done. You're approaching 40. You have yet to fly from your mother's nest. You're just collecting your disabled adult child status and that's probably what you're going to do for the remainder of your life. 

No Hollywood dream job is coming. Who has been discovered from social media? What do I expect - a major motion picture company to say? We're blown away, we're awe-inspired, we're star struck from your artwork. Let's make a movie.

No, who has been discovered from social media by a major motion picture company and they say, let's make a movie. That just doesn't happen. You're having delusions of grandeur.

And satisfaction comes from having a job. Even if it is a part time laborer job.

Somebody says, if you get a part time job making minimal money half your problems will be solved immediately. You'll have money so you won't be so dependent on your parents.

Right now, literally I'm collecting minimal money, provided by the government. But I'm really dependent on my parents. I'm afraid to lose my disabled adult child status. And I'm hoping I'm going to be a Hollywood superstar as famous as these pop stars and movie stars with millions and billions of dollars. 

They say, sorry to burst your bubble, Andrew but nobody is going to discover you from social media. If you want to make yourself successful - GET A JOB!",1,1759236905.0,AndrewKoloski,0,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

I’m not very hopeful that this will lead to establishing contact, but I do feel there was a lot left unsaid that deserves a conversation for both of us.

I'm a 35-year-old male from Slovakia (Europe), visiting Oman for the third time. My first two visits were purely business-related - I've been working on virtual tours for Sultan Haitham City.   
  
This time, I have three days (Thursday-Saturday) free to explore Muscat. During this time, I'm looking to:

* Roam around the city by myself, explore architecture, try out different foods and drinks...
* Meet a couple of locals with common interests over coffee or lunch
* Do an artistic street-style photoshoot with a local Omani woman, near some beautiful architecture

Photography is my main hobby, and I enjoy capturing everyday life in an artistic way. Other hobbies include chess, sports, traveling, and video games.   
  
I've loved what I've seen from Oman's culture and architecture so far - understated, respecting heritage, not chasing trends... Btw your airport is one of the top 2 most beautiful and well-built ones I've been to (Doha just edges it).

Please share some hidden gems on where/what to go see and photograph in Muscat.

And if we share some common interests/hobbies, DM me if you're interested to meet up!",1,1759236810.0,Oman,1,1.0,False

I LOVE it here, always have. For the longest time I was a 5 am-er. Then I had some pregnancies, some new schedules, etc that messed with when i would go to the gym, the times i would go would often change, but i still went at least 3 times a week. Then I got a new job in 2023 that allowed me to work from home. This worked great with my kids school schedules and I didnt have to be up too early to get the gym and then get to work. I was able to take an early lunch (i got 1 hour) and run to the gym at 11am instead. I did this until about March this year (2025) when the administration made us go back in office. I stuck it out as long as I could but I couldn't continue working there as it became toxic, so I got a new job which is again work from home. But, I no longer have an hour lunch, only 30 min so that puts the gym out. I also coach my son's travel soccer team 2 nights a week, so I cant go those days, I coach my daughter's u5 team 1 night a week, and they both do ice skating (my son is interested in ice hockey) another night. My studio doesn't have Friday classes after 430pm, which is right before I finish working. And im unable to do weekend mornings because my husband works on the weekends so i have no childcare. This leaves me with: 5am.  I cant go any other time in the morning because in order for everyone to be ready and our the door on time, my husband and I both get up at 630am to finish getting the kids stuff ready, get the kids up, dressed, and eating, and then out the door. My husband leaves for work and to take the youngest to preschool at 7:20am, I start work at 8am (in my office at 7:50), and my son walks himself to the bus stop at 8:20. I finish working at 4:30, sometimes a little later, and then sports activities start at 5:30 or 6 depending on the day.

I have now been working at my new job full time for just over a month. I gave myself some leeway the first week to get used to waking up so much earlier. We've been really good about getting the kids lunches packed the night before, my husband's lunch mostly done, coffee ready to go, etc, so that we dont have to do it in the morning.  And I have successfully gotten myself to bed between 9:30-10pm (9:30 mostly) almost every night so that I can wake up at 4:30 for the gym. I think i made it to the gym 2 times the first week, which was ok, I know I was getting back into the swing of things. But since then, I just cant get myself up. I am EXHAUSTED when I wake up. I haven't been in 3 weeks now. I keep telling myself the night before that I am going to go. I have my clothes ready, everything is done for the next morning, I am falling asleep just fine! But then something happens the next morning that I cant go. Usually its just that I'm so tired that i turn off the alarm and then fall right back to sleep until 6:30am. This morning was the tip of the iceberg for me, I did everything the same, was asleep at 9:45 (according to my fit bit) and when I woke up at 4:30 I had a migraine! I dont know what to do here! How am I supposed to get myself up and going???? Someone please, give me whatever advice you can!

I’m about to start titration with PUK and I’m kinda stressed because my life is all over the place. I wake up at random times (usually around noon), I stay up late and like the nighttime more than daytime. I skip breakfast and don’t eat until later in the day. I smoke cigs and weed, and I have one iced coffee when I wake up. I’m kind of isolated, unemployed, and every day is different. Some days I’m motivated and get a lot done around the house, other days I feel mentally paralysed and struggle to get out of bed. I just push through and never know what to expect from my own brain.

I’m scared about side effects. SSRIs gave me the most extreme side effects and I haven’t tried anything else in years. I’m especially scared of losing my appetite, being unable to sleep, or feeling jittery and anxious. I’m also not sure what I’m supposed to “test” the meds on when I don’t have structure or obligations, but I think I’ll need to take them daily for the first few weeks of titration.

Do ADHD meds even work if your life is like this, or do I need to force myself into alarms and breakfast just to avoid side effects like insomnia or a crash later?

1nuc945,https://www.youtube.com/shorts/JqLLBvpya0w,TN Doctors are still surviving just only on fear mongering of general mass,"In the recent Neeya Naana episode, one side had doctors & other side had people practicing some specific diets. 

Majority of the participants were immature or doing trivial diets , that weren't right in the first place.... 

However , the doctors advices were the worse.   
It should the majority of these doctors have outdated knowledge & have not read latest research in several subjects.   
The Doctors were rejecting any & every diet that the Audience was suggesting and trying hard to find faults in their diets. They were just trying to scare the people off, indicating, come to a doctor & we will tell you what to do.... 

there were numerous wrong things prescribed by the doctors in this show alone, I will list a few

\- A doctor says our diet 45% should be carbs - the main reason India is a daibetic capital of the world. 

\- A Gastro says high protein high fiber diet is extremely bad - I dont know how she even passed her exams. 

\- She was also saying there is nothing called detox. 

\- A postpartum surgeon says - Dont eat proteins, its dangerous. 

\- Pretty much everyone saying no to Intermittent fasting, thought this is was our ancient method & also today all modern medicine is prescribing it. 

\- Lot of them saying low carb or keto is bad , though in the west all doctors are prescribing it . There is enough scientific evidence supporting it.

& many more examples 

  
The doctors just scaring people who do extreme diets etc.... 

Yes few incidents happen, but % of people dying due to extreme diets is almost negligible compared  deaths due to bad health .

This lady in the video ( not in this video, but other videos) actually spoke in a very funny & innocent way .She pointed out that during the break, all doctors had coffee with sugar ( though few mins back they all uniformly blamed sugar as #1 culprit) compared to only few from the general audience took coffee.

what Doctors preach , they themselves dont follow. 

Looking at the fitness of the majority of the doctors, they were unhealthy for their age & if there was a race between the doctors & general audience, the general audience would have won. 

One of the reasons why India has so much bad health is due to to these outdated methods & knowledges of our Doctors 

Our doctors community always has a 30 yrs delay from the latest discovery from the west.... 

In the 80s west started saying to bread.... but only after 2010 India adopted it.

90s west said there is no cholesterol gain due to eggs,but we were blaming eggs for cholesterol... now only we have accepted it.... & the list goes on.

1nuc91t,https://www.reddit.com/r/moviecritic/comments/1nuc91t/a_big_bold_beautiful_journey/,"A Big, Bold, Beautiful Journey","Every now and then, a movie comes along that doesn’t work but is worth watching, when time permits. *A Big, Bold, Beautiful Journey* is one of those movies. It has a lot going for it but it never comes together in the way the filmmakers intended. It’s the cinematic equivalent of visiting a curio shop while on vacation–there are plenty of interesting things to look at but nothing worth buying. The movie is very much less the sum of its parts, despite the beauty of several scenes and the overall craftsmanship on display. Together, however, it’s a well-intentioned misfire.

The problems begin with Colin Farrell and Margot Robbie, two actors the camera adores but exhibit little chemistry for each other in this movie. They did manage to hold my attention because they are movie stars, born with that undeniable magnetism that makes them watchable no matter what they’re doing on screen. Even though Farrell and Robbie nail all of the varying emotional states the movie asks of them, they can’t overcome the movie’s severe case of tonal whiplash.

On a visual level, Kogonada delivers one perfectly-framed scene after another. This might be one of the best-looking films I’ll see this year. (Although films viewed as failures are rarely recognized, cinematographer Benjamin Loeb deserves to be.) Whenever Kogonada isn’t mooning over Farrell and Robbie, he gives us breathtaking views of the California terrain, with tree lined roads, quaint walk-ups, coffee shops, and so on. There are times when the movie adopts a painterly aesthetic, dabbling in surrealism, impressionism and other art forms. The film is a feast for the eyes. Even Farrell and Robbie’s costumes are perfect.

Unfortunately, no matter how hard Farrell, Robbie and Kononada try, nothing in the movie gels. This is due to how the story is structured. Having two characters simultaneously explore the formative moments from their childhood that left them scarred emotionally takes away from both. The dialog is overly verbose, perhaps striving for the rhythm of a film from the Forties. Whatever the intent, it sounds out of place in a modern world.

Despite presenting itself as a romantic comedy, the movie is only fleetingly interested in being either. For the most part, the movie is a serious emotional drama, an examination of two people who can’t experience love. Aside from the dramatic moments, every other tone the movie reaches for feels off. The whimsy is forced, the romance timid and the comedy mild. The movie’s sweet-spot is its therapy-influenced sequences, which are effective but never build towards an emotional release.

*A Big, Bold, Beautiful Journey* fails because its story is neither cohesive nor captivating. However, if you’re curious and have time on your hands, the movie creates a beautiful world for Margo Robbie and Colin Farrell to wander through at their peak handsomeness. **Not Recommended**.

1nuc7a3,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1nuc7a3/my_turn_has_come/,My turn has come :),"The obligatory celebratory & thank you note. 

I passed my PMP exam AT/AT/AT!

About me: IT background by education and by profession. 12 years of progressive program management experience in big tech, the last 4 of which I’ve been a people manager. I learned everything I know by doing — I haven’t have any formal project management education. I’ve been at the same company this whole time, so I’m acutely aware that I only really know project/program management in this specific company’s business environment. I was interested in getting the PMP cert to 1) get some career cushioning with all of the uncertainties in the tech industry right now and 2) learn some of the industry standard “jargon” that’s used so I can properly label the stuff I’m already doing at work (so I can be better teach the junior folks I manage).

Test method: At home. I took the test on a Saturday morning and got my result about 44 hours after my exam start time. I had zero issues with the online platform — did the system test 1 week and again 1 day before the exam. I use a MacBook Pro with Chrome browser. My biggest scare was that when I finished question 180 on the exam I accidentally let out a huge sigh and said an expletive out loud 😂 Was very worried that would get me disqualified. 

Study method: 
- I don’t recommend this at all, but in the spirit of transparency and paying it forward on this sub, I will share. I took AR’s Udemy course and took my sweet time. I’m talking 1-2 hours PER WEEK, and I used up the full 6 months that I had access to the course. I watched the videos at 2x speed and took notes that I never looked at again. I took the practice quizzes and practice exam on the platform as I went through the course and got ~70% score on average. The quality of the practice questions were pretty poor IMO — oddly specific and bad grammar throughout. I kept thinking that there was no way the PMI questions would be like this. 
- After finishing the video course, I went through AR’s book and reviewed everything but the ECO and practice exam (idk if that practice exam was the same as the one on Udemy). The mini quizzes at the end of the chapter were also oddly specific at times, but the quality was better. I highlighted the info that still felt new/unfamiliar to me even after watching his videos. I put sticky notes on the items that I really felt I would need to double down on. I spent about 3 hours per weekend doing this, for about 6 weeks. I also would watch 5-10 min of AR’s videos on YouTube as I laid on the couch/in bed most evenings. 
- At this point my studying process started to feel really drawn out and I had no sense of whether I was really retaining anything worthwhile. With a slight nudge from my husband, I signed up for the exam to give myself a deadline. 
- Then I locked in for a month. I joined this sub, and based on all of your recommendations I bought SH Plus, started watching DM and MR on YouTube, and bought the third3rock notes. I did at least 30 min of practice questions on SH or through the YouTube videos from AR/DM/MR after work. I did 1-2 hours on Saturdays and Sundays. I took SH exams 1 and 2 on separate weekends, and scored 77% and 78%. I replicated exam conditions for these practice exams (exact same morning routine, breakfast, time and testing space as I’d use on actual exam day). Based on what I’ve heard from you all, these are good scores and gave me a lot more confidence about my readiness. I didn’t take the other 3 practice exams, mostly out of laziness. I felt that I got a good enough feeling on what the exam conditions would feel like from the first two. I am a long distance runner in my (now non-existent) free time, and those exams honestly felt like running a marathon. I employed a lot of the same mental and breathing tactics I employ during races. 
- The week leading up to the exam, I took a vacation to Hawaii and REALLY locked in. Hawaii is 6 hours behind where I live, so thanks to jet lag I had the early mornings to focus on studying before I could go out and about for vacation activities with my family. It really helped to not have distractors from my real job that week. On the 4th day I felt really sick of studying, so I took a break and then got back the next day. Each day, I would rotate between watching mindset videos, reviewing my highlights and stickies from AR’s book, reviewing questions I got wrong on SH in the past, and reviewing third3rock notes. 
- The day before the exam I rewatched a DM mindset video (I vibed with his supportive tone the most of all the three instructors) and memorized formulas. I ate a balanced dinner and went to bed early. Did my best to remain relaxed all day, but I still had a pit in my stomach. 
- The morning of the exam was very calm and quiet. I laid out everything I would need during the 10 minute breaks (water, coffee, a small smack, and a foam roller).
- During the exam: I got 1 drag and drop question, 4 questions that required some sort of math (only 2 of them really required knowing formulas) and the rest were all situational questions. Most the situational questions had 2 answers that felt right, and ultimately it came down to honing in on the details and picking the best one. I was well ahead of time on the first 60 questions. I was a little bit ahead of time on the second 60 questions. The fatigue really set in on the third 60 questions. I managed to review all of my flagged questions (I had about 25 throughout the entire exam) and I finished the exam with 2 minutes left. Very glad I was ahead on time for the first two sections. I left the exam feeling mentally cooked and definitely like I failed the People questions. 

Overall thoughts: All the stuff that is said over and over again on this sub are SO true. Mindset and practice questions are key. SH is the closest thing to the actually exam. I have nothing new/novel to add. I’ll just say that the exam is truly a mix of a test of your knowledge (as PMI sees it) AND your mental endurance.

I really think my exam performance could have gone either way. If you don’t pass on your first try, don’t beat yourself up. Keep practicing, don’t waste 6 months like I did and actually lock in, and keep your test taking endurance top of mind. 

For my own mental health I am going to remove myself from this sub, figure out how to get all the PMP videos off of my YouTube algorithm, and throw away my exam prep book and notes. I’ll stay on this sub for another couple of days in case any of you have questions. This sub is truly a gem — thank you all so much for the knowledge sharing and support.

I have no technical skills or formal training.  
I only have inspiration and the need to communicate something.  
How would you define my style?

I created this work as a tribute to one of the deepest and most meaningful murals by Escif “La vida es otra cosa.”  
An invitation to look beyond our screens, beyond the walls that imprison us, to finally recognize ourselves in what we truly are.

That mural, one of the most iconic in Valencia, was unfortunately erased by an advertising campaign of a streaming multinational. As Escif himself recalls:  
*“Allowing a multinational to erase a mural with social content in order to promote itself can only be understood as yet another victory of capitalism over culture. Money imposes itself over ideas. The market imposes its law over people’s lives. The window that had once been opened disappears once again. Concrete goes back to being concrete.”*

The story of that work became, for me, an obsession, a wound, but also a source of inspiration. I therefore wanted to pay tribute with my own personal interpretation of the concept.  
Real life is not what we believe we observe through our screens, but what we too often let slip away, grain after grain, from the hourglass of the time we have been given.

From the poignant sea of Posillipo, among the scent of salt carried by the embrace of Neapolitan coffee’s intense aroma, facing the magnificence of Vesuvius, this can become clear to anyone.  
Life is something else.

1nuc362,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1nuc362/its_okay_to_take_a_break/,It’s okay to take a break,"I’m on day 5 of my 18 day trip to Japan. Currently in Osaka.

Today had already been set to be an exploring day, since the friend I’m here with is doing something else I decided not to do. I’d still planned on spending most of the day out and about, seeing as many neighborhoods and things between here and Kyoto as I could. But an old injury has been flaring up and I woke up and realized I hadn’t recovered from Nara yesterday, I couldn’t even walk to the bathroom in our hotel room without pain. So I decided that I shouldn’t go anywhere that would take a while to get back to my hotel, since I have plans to do Himeji Castle and Engyoji Temple tomorrow and it’s more important that I can survive that.

So after staying in bed until they came around to clean my room, I went to a coffee shop I’d been noticing along the walk to and from the station but never took the time to stop at. I had the most amazing fig French toast, which reminded me that I had planned on looking for figs while I was here. It was also just a lovely vibe and I sat and read a bit.

I remembered I placed an Amazon order I needed to pick up, so I walked to the area where the locker was supposed to be and walked down into the train station and back out before realizing it was in the Lawson’s. Even that small excursion was excruciating so I knew I needed to do something to help the pain.

I decided an onsen would probably provide the most relief. I don’t feel comfortable naked and looked for a private one, but they were all way more than I wanted to spend. So I decided to go to one a little ways off instead of the one at Osaka station, in part because it was less than half the cost, but also because I was worried the other one would have more tourists, meaning more likely to run into people feeling just as awkward as me, making the whole vibe an anxious one.

Since I was close to the train station I just went straight there. And, honestly, the most awkward part of my first onsen experience was trying to figure out how the seated showers worked. The place I went to had four hot baths plus one cold one. I tried them all. They all felt amazing. And even more amazing, it did in fact relieve a lot of my pain.

Excitedly walking back to the station, I decided to duck down a street with a lot of shops and found a grocery store selling figs! I also got some giant pink grapes and a bar of black chocolate.

When I got to the station, the train was down. I wandered around a bit more looking for food but couldn’t find anything I wanted that was open, many places opened at 5 or later. So I just waited, and about 40 minutes later they were up again.

The delay meant I missed lunch hours at a place I wanted to try, and they were now closed until 6. So I went back to my hotel, waited a bit, then looked up their menu, and realized they didn’t have anything I could eat anyway. Still wanting to stick to a short walk from the hotel, especially since the trains had gone down again, I found an amazing udon place and the owner was so incredibly kind.

All in all, it was a day crafted from necessity, not intentionality, and I still had what may be one of my most authentic days I’ll have this trip, and I didn’t even leave the hotel until noon.

So don’t beat yourself up if you find you have to stray from your plans. There may be an even better day waiting for you.",87,1759235989.0,JapanTravelTips,40,0.94,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

I try not to be a slactivist, in that I regularly donate to charitable causes and local groups, because that's kinda all I'm capable of doing. I vote tactically bc I live in what was historically a Tory safe seat, and while we still do have a Tory mp, there is a very real danger we will get a reform mp at the next general election. I would consider myself a demsoc/socdem. I think the next natural step for the UK is to become a Nordic model styled society, but we would be idiots, to stop there and rest on our laurels. I want to live in a democratic socialist nation, where anyone can be rich but nobody is poor.




Now, my town is right leaning, boomery, and very working class. We have a lot of low income people here, and a lot of disabled people here. We also, somehow, have a lot of local groups, run by and for our community, helping people the most in need. We don't have a trussel trust food bank here, because we don't actually need one. We have two food banks here, one secular, one Christian, who will happily let you into their community pantry no questions asked. The secular one also provides activities for disabled children, and serves a cooked lunch to anyone who turns up, for free, every single day. I have volunteered at this organisation,and they are genuinely the best people in my town, fr.




We have a community centre that goes out of its way to help local residents of all ages. They provide multiple social clubs for the elderly and disabled. They work closely with a charity that helps refugees in our area. They do a lot to help people struggling with unemployment. They have a signposting service specifically intended for younger people to help them find support for various things. They run a work coaching club for disabled people. And you can walk into their centre every single day during opening hours, even if it's just to be indoors, use the loo, have a coffee, have a sit down, whatever. Also some of the best people in my town.




This is literally scratching the surface of what we have in my town, we somehow have even more grassroots groups to help out vulnerable communities, and we have an excellent local Facebook group to help connect residents to local services. But here is the kicker: all the people who are actually out there, doing the boots on the ground work to make my shithole town a better place, are liberals at best. The guy who runs the based food bank? Centre left. The staff at the community centre? Centrists. The admin of the Facebook group, who does a ton of community advocacy and organising on the side? Centre left, and extremely pro Palestinian. None of these people would consider themselves leftists in the slightest. Pretty much all of them are basically lib Dems. They don't want to live in my dream socialist utopia. They vibe w capitalism, and they like making money. But they're still the people who are actually working hard every single day to make our town less shite.




We do have a local chapter of every major party, and beyond using these people and their organisations as props and photo ops, they commit no real support to the area and the community. Now I will admit that maybe this is just how Britain, especially rural Britain is, but hand to god, as much as I'm a socialist, the centrists and liberals are the ones in my experience making crappy towns better and busting their asses. They aren't devolving into petty infighting, they work together and get shit done. I don't intend this as any kind of liberal apologia, and I wish I lived in an area where the socialists and communists were actually doing shit, but I don't, and I'm being honest about what I see in my area and country. I feel like too many leftists are obsessed with looking like good people, and not actually invested in actually being good people. If you have wholesome stories of effective leftist community organisers in your area, please do share.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

I’m 20 years old, living in Lithuania, and I already feel completely lost. I’ve been depressed since I was 15, and back then I was already suicidal. I really believed things would get better after finishing school - but they didn’t.

One good thing I did do was go to a vocational school where I could learn programming while finishing high school. It saved me four years of university, only for me to realize programming isn’t for me.

But then came another huge problem: compulsory military conscription. I really hate the idea of being forced into something I don’t believe in. I managed to avoid it for one year because of my depression, but at the last moment during a medical check they almost sent me there anyway, even though I had official documents saying I’m unfit. Alternative service exists on paper but is very difficult to access. And next year I’ll have to go through the same stress again.

After finishing school I tried working on some personal projects for months while unemployed. Nothing worked out. 6 months gone with only a little experience to show for it. Now I have a physically hard job - 12 hours a day, 4 days on, 4 days off. By the time my days off come, I’m too drained to do anything. The pay is unlivable. I still live with my parents, which is the only reason I’m not homeless.

I’ve had depression since 15, plus ADHD, which makes everything harder. Life feels like it’s constantly testing me. Where I live, mental health support is terrible. The wait to get help is often over a month - plenty of time for someone to harm themselves. Lithuania used to be number one in suicides among developed countries. Now it’s a little lower but the situation still feels bad.

I’ve lost hope. People told me when I was 15 that things would get better. Five years later it’s only gotten harder. I’ve been lonely for years. Even in school, where I talked to classmates, I still felt lonely. When school ended I lost all the people I used to talk to. Now I basically haven’t had a real conversation with someone my age in almost a year.

What makes it harder is that in school everyone - classmates, teachers - told me I was smart. And I think I am. But that only makes things harder because I expected more of myself and life expected more of me.

Finding friends feels impossible. I’m introverted, and I struggle with small talk. When people talk, I just don’t know what to say back.

I even thought about trying to find a girlfriend, but honestly that just feels impossible too. I live in the biggest city here, so I thought dating apps would give me a better chance. I used them for a few months, changed my photos, rewrote my bio, tried everything and I got literally zero matches. And it’s not like I think I’m ugly. I’d say I’m like a 7/10 a bit overweight but not fat. After a while I just kept seeing the same faces over and over, and it felt pointless, so I deleted them.

People always say dumb stuff like ‘just go to bars, coffee shops, or take some classes.’ But I don’t like bars or clubs, and I’m not gonna bother someone who’s working at a café. And stuff like dance or yoga classes… I’m just not into it. If I went, it would only be to meet people, and that would feel fake. So yeah, dating just ended up being another dead end for me, and it makes the loneliness hit even harder.

So how do I cope day to day? I listen to music and sing when nobody’s home so they don’t hear my bad singing XD. I love video games, especially driving games. If I had the money I’d be doing sim racing by now. On my days off I drink two beers - not to get drunk, but just to feel a bit better. And I love dark humor; sometimes it’s the only thing that helps me laugh.

If my life were different, I’d like to find companionship someday, maybe relocate somewhere else, and get a better job than the one I have now. Maybe even start a YouTube channel soon to talk about these problems and what I think about the world.

Right now I’m 20 but feel like I’m 80. Everything I’ve tried hasn’t worked. I’m stuck in a job that drains me for an unlivable salary. Alone. No future, no way out. And even though life keeps hitting me, I’m still trying, but I don’t know how much longer I can keep going when everything I do feels worthless.

I’m just sharing this because I needed to get it out.",3,1759234488.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,0.81,False
