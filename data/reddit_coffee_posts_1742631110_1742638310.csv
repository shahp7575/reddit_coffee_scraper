1jh58hr,https://www.reddit.com/r/managementconsulting/comments/1jh58hr/career_question_uk/,Career Question (UK),"Hi All.

I have strong conviction that Management/Strategy consulting is the most suitable career for me. I am not worries about the hours, and believe it aligns most closely with my skills and interests than what I am currently in. However, I’m not sure where to start.

Brief Background: Law degree, and worked in Corporate Law for a bit. Was interesting but narrow and being someone interested in more (i.e business and finance), I moved into a finance role in London. For my age, comp is very good, and I am confident in my place in the firm, but it lacks any creativity. Throughout university and since, I founded and ran multiple businesses as well on the side (mix of results, some moderate with positive cashflow, one failure, one six figure turnover). 

While I appreciate it isn’t a great look to flip-flop between careers, I think all of these experiences will be helpful in a consulting role. I don’t have an MBA, but Law degree from one of the top UK law schools, got A*s in both Econ and Business at A-level, and have practical experience within the corporate world. In my current Finance role, I interact daily with CEO’s, PE firms etc so would like to say I feel comfortable with that side of consulting as well.

However, I don’t have any connections in the area. I live and work in central london/the city so if anyone does have any insights i’d be happy to take you out for coffee or pay for a call. 

Any advice, guidance etc would be much appreciated. (or criticism if you think i’m off the mark!)

1jh56u6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jh56u6,February 15-19: The Days Joong and Est Decided to Leave Us Crumbs and Drive Us Insane,"Introduction

Alright, my friends, today we’re going to talk about a very special moment. A moment when Joong and Est, without exaggeration, threw Twitter into chaos and set Reddit on fire.

February 19, 2024—AKA “The Day of the Refollow”, AKA “The Day They Finally Dropped the Act”, AKA “The Day Some People Had Cold Sweats Realizing That Maybe, Just Maybe, What They Called Fan-Service Wasn’t Fan-Service After All.”

So, sit down, grab a coffee (or tea if you’re feeling fancy), and let me walk you through this beautifully chaotic romantic comedy.

⸻

Act 1: The Sky9 Concert and the VIP Stalker

It’s February 15, and Sky9 is holding a concert. So far, nothing out of the ordinary. But who suddenly decides to show up in the audience, acting all casual like he just happened to be there? Joong.

Joong—who has never been particularly close to Sky9, who didn’t even take pictures with them, who didn’t post about the event, who didn’t even crack a smile at them (okay, maybe I’m exaggerating). But what did he do?

He sat in VIP. Front row. Next to William.

So, let me get this straight:
	•	Joong paid extra for a VIP seat.
	•	William was on one side.
	•	And Est? Right in front of him on stage.

And just for fun, let me mention that Dunk was there too, but he had a regular seat.

Coincidence? I think not.

And the cherry on top? Joong arrived early. Way before the concert even started.

⸻

Act 2: Joong’s Distress Signals

After spending the evening staring at his “best friend” on stage like a man having a full-blown emotional crisis, Joong went home and did what any normal person in love would do: post a subliminal message.

➡️ A story with a sad puppy in a car, accompanied by the phrase:
“ไม่เคยคิดถึงกันเลย” (“You never miss me?” / “Have I never crossed your mind?”)

HMMM… Interesting.

Why would Joong, who just came back from a concert where he looked totally fine, immediately post something so melancholic?

Why use a sentence that screams “I was expecting something from you, but I didn’t get it”?

WHY THE SAD PUPPY??

Joong, you are a grown man, not a golden retriever abandoned on the side of the road.

So, once again:

The man spends the entire evening watching Est perform, goes home, and tweets something that reeks of longing and frustration?

With a sad puppy emoji? A. Sad. Puppy?

This is straight-up nostalgia, jealousy, a cry for attention—in other words, Joong missing Est.

⸻

Act 3: Est, as Subtle as a Brick to the Face

While Twitter was (mildly) on fire over Joong’s tweet, Est acted like nothing happened… until the next day.

➡️ On Instagram, he posted the song “Constant” by Jeremy Barrera with the caption: “You’re my constant.”

EXCUSE ME??

Why this song? Why choose lyrics that talk about someone who is always there, about stability, about an unwavering presence?

Doesn’t this feel like “I’m here, calm down, stop your theatrics”?

Joong has an emotional breakdown on Twitter, and Est, all chill, responds on a different platform with the most obvious message possible?

This is next-level encrypted communication. CIA, take notes.

⸻

Act 4: Late Valentine’s Day

After that little declaration through music, Est decided to seal the deal with one last move.

➡️ On February 19, Est posted a story with a sticker of a face with heart eyes and the words:
“When I look at you.”

THIS GUY.

The same guy who never posts anything remotely romantic, who never lets his emotions slip in public, suddenly drops this on the exact day they publicly reconcile?

This is Shakespeare-level drama. This is Romeo & Juliet but with Twitter and Instagram stickers.

⸻

Act 5: The Legendary Refollow

As if that weren’t enough, just a few hours after his ultra-subtle post, Joong decided to FOLLOW EST BACK.

The man picked up his phone, opened Instagram, searched for Est’s account, and clicked “Follow.”

And guess what? A few hours later, Est did the same.

You really expect me to believe that this is just a coincidence? That it means nothing?

Because what I see is a guy who was sulking, waiting for validation, and another guy saying, “Relax, I’m still here.”

⸻

Act 6: “I Hope Everything Will Be Fine”

And to wrap up the arc beautifully, Joong posted one last message to close this emotional saga:

➡️ “From now on, I hope everything will be fine.”

… A few MINUTES after refollowing Est.

AND YOU STILL THINK THIS WAS A COINCIDENCE?

Joong was stressed out, missed his man, finally got him back, and sighed in relief.

This was his emotional closure.

⸻

Conclusion: Who’s Still in Denial?

So, let’s recap:

✅ Joong stalked Est at the concert from VIP.
✅ Joong posted a sad, needy message on Twitter after watching Est.
✅ Est responded with a love song on Instagram.
✅ They refollowed each other after that.
✅ Joong wrapped it up with “I hope everything will be fine.”

At this point, if you still think this was all a coincidence, I don’t know what to tell you.

These two are so obvious

Alright, my friends, if you thought the previous episode was enough, think again. Because we’re now entering a level of cryptic messaging that would make NASA jealous.

Today, we’re diving into the suspiciously synchronized coded messages that Joong and Est dropped, and of course, that mysterious birthday cake—whose sender remains unconfirmed, yet the entire universe already knows the answer.

So, grab a coffee, a tea, or whatever drink keeps you hydrated, because you’re going to need it to process all this.

—

Act 7: “Choose Yourself First” – Joong, the Morning Philosopher

It’s the morning of February 19. Joong, wide awake at dawn (probably after a night spent reflecting on life, love, and poor decisions), decides to philosophize on the internet.

He posts on both Instagram and Twitter:

➡️ “You have to choose yourself first before choosing the person who has chosen you.”

Hmm… interesting.

Let’s not forget that just a few days earlier, he had already served us a very melancholic message with a sad puppy after watching Est sing at his concert. And now, he’s back with this very introspective quote that, let’s be honest, screams post-argument self-reflection.

This is not just some random Pinterest quote he stumbled upon. Oh no. This is a coded message.

Translation?

Joong is basically confessing that before he could return to someone (and let’s be real, it’s not William, nor Dunk, nor Sky9, nor his mom), he had to work on himself first. He had to choose himself, figure out what he wanted, and come to terms with his feelings.

Because yes, my friends, sometimes love isn’t just “we love each other, end of story.” Sometimes, you need to go through a full existential crisis before finding your way back to the one you love.

And Joong? Oh, he was deep in it.

Act 8: Est, the Master of Timing and Subliminal Responses

While all of Twitter is wondering whether Joong is sending out a redemption message, Est, on the other hand, grabs his phone and decides that now is the perfect time to respond.

➡️ He posts a sticker with heart-eyes and the text: “When I look at you.”

Excuse me? WHAT?

The guy who NEVER expresses himself on these matters suddenly posts a message that basically says, “When I look at you…”

So, in summary:
	•	Joong: “I had to choose myself first…”
	•	Est: “When I look at you…”

Oh, the poetry. The beauty of timing. The Thai Shakespeare we deserve.

⸻

Act 9: Joong’s Tweet That Settles Everything

As if that wasn’t enough, THAT SAME MORNING, just hours after his “choosing yourself first” post, Joong drops another tweet:

➡️ “When you find someone who is loyal, keep them.”

What is this? A brain teaser? A puzzle to solve?

Because this is literally a subtext that says:

➡️ “I know this person has always been there, has never betrayed me, is loyal. I must not lose them.”

And suddenly, everything becomes clear.

This phrase + Est’s Instagram story + the timing = we got it, guys. He took his time, he reflected, but now he knows. He knows who the loyal person in his life is. He knows he needs to keep them.

And who, in recent history, has been faithful, discreet, patient, and always there, even when Joong was having his post-fanservice crisis?

Exactly.

⸻

Act 10: “Don’t You Miss Me?” – When Est Responds with a Song and a Declaration

If you thought Joong and Est communicated like normal people, think again. This is a masterclass in subliminal messaging, coded exchanges, and lyrical responses.

First, the dates, because timing never lies:
	•	February 16: Joong posts a sentence in Thai, saying:
➡️ “Don’t you miss me? Do you ever think about me sometimes?”after the concert.
	•	February 17: Est responds—but in his own way. He doesn’t just type out a reply like everyone else. Oh no.
➡️ He posts BOTH a song and a caption.
	•	The song?
“Constant.”
	•	The caption under his post?
“You are my constant.”

You wanted drama? You wanted subliminal messaging wrapped in aesthetics? Here, take this.

⸻

1. Joong’s Direct Question: “Don’t You Miss Me?”

Let’s be honest.
This is NOT a random phrase. This is NOT some deep philosophical reflection on life. This is a direct, clear-cut question aimed at one specific person.

Who is he talking about?
	•	His fans? Highly unlikely.
	•	A random friend? Even less.
	•	Someone who might have distanced themselves after some tensions? YES.

And who could that be?

➡️ A certain someone who had unfollowed him on Instagram. A certain someone who, despite the media storm, never said a single bad word about him. A certain someone who, for months, has been watching everything in silence.

In short, Est.

And as if on cue, Est responds the very next day.

⸻

2. Est’s Response: “You Are My Constant.”

Est could have just liked the post, done a random IG story, or ignored it completely.

But no. Instead, he responds with:

➡️ “You Are My Constant.”

He insists so much that he puts the song title in the post AND in the caption.

Now, let’s break this response down properly.

⸻

3. “Constant” = Always There, No Matter What

What does “constant” mean?
It means something that never changes, that remains stable no matter the circumstances.

So, in other words, Est is saying:

➡️ “Yes, I miss you. Yes, I still think about you. Because YOU ARE MY CONSTANT.”

See the connection?
	•	Joong: “Don’t you miss me?”
	•	Est: “You are my constant.”

In other words:

➡️ “Of course I miss you. But I’ve always been here.”

And you know what’s even crazier?

THIS ISN’T EVEN THE END.

⸻

4. February 19: The Subtextual Reunion

As if their coded exchange wasn’t obvious enough, two days later, Joong follows up with two new phrases:

➡️ “You have to choose yourself first, before choosing the person who has chosen you.”
➡️ “When you find someone loyal, keep them.”

At this point, he’s not even trying to be subtle anymore.

And on the same day, what do we get?

➡️ Est posts a sticker that says “When I look at you.” with heart-eyes.
➡️ They refollow each other on Instagram.

Have you ever seen a more perfect sequence of events?

⸻

5. The Clear Timeline (For Those Still in Denial)
	1.	February 16: Joong asks “Don’t you miss me?”
	2.	February 17: Est responds “You are my constant.”
	3.	February 19: Joong realizes he needs to choose the one who always chose him.
	4.	The same day, Est replies with a crystal-clear message.
	5.	They refollow each other.

At this point, we’re not talking about coincidences anymore. This is a full-blown romance playing out on Twitter and Instagram.

⸻

Conclusion: Who’s Still Denying It? (Again and Again)

✅ Joong tests the waters by asking “Don’t you miss me?”
✅ Est doesn’t answer directly—but he answers.
✅ He makes it so obvious that he puts “You Are My Constant” as both the song title AND the caption.
✅ Two days later, Joong declares that he’s choosing the person who has always chosen him.
✅ Est seals the deal by posting a sticker with heart-eyes.
✅ They refollow each other.

If you STILL think this is all just a coincidence… well, I can’t help you.

End of Act 10.

Act 11: The Suspicious Cake from march 10th

A quick flashback to Joong’s birthday, because we still have another puzzle piece to fit in.

On march 10th, he received a cake with this message:

➡️ “Being yourself means not seeking acceptance from others. You don’t need to be loved by others. You need to accept yourself first.”

Now, who could have possibly sent that cake?

Hint: Someone who has always preached about not caring what others think and staying true to oneself.

A certain shark, perhaps?

And what did Joong say a month later?

➡️ “Choose yourself first.”

Could that cake have actually been a disguised message, a sort of “Remember who you are” from Est?

I am absolutely convinced.

⸻

Conclusion: Who’s Still in Denial? (Reprise)

✅ Joong goes through an existential crisis.
✅ Est replies in a cryptic yet very obvious way.
✅ Joong realizes that Est is his constant. And that same day, they refollow each other on Instagram.
✅ The timing is way too perfect to be a coincidence.
✅ The march cake now makes total sense.

If you still think this is all just a coincidence… well, I can’t help you anymore.

I’m wondering what could cause this color and texture difference.

Used the same coffee and recipe for both of them. The green cup extracted a bit slower, but still under 30s.

It’s true that the blue cup rested a bit until I made the other one, but the difference was apparent from the get-go.

Could it be that the puck prep was not good for one of them?

I had a dream where I was somewhere in New York driving to a coffeeshop and after I was done with my coffee and reading a book I got out and I was about to get into my car and I hear sounds in an allyway next to the coffee shop it's almost like someone getting mugged and next I hear gunshots and I went to go check 

And this woman walks tawords me with blood on her shirt and she said to me with a shock in her eyes 

I TRIED TO RESIST 

She walk slowly to me and as she's was about to collabs I catched her and I told her I need to take u to a hospital fast

I put her in the passenger side and I drove as fast as I could but I could see there was not much time as she was losing blood 

This may sound weird but I am also a surgeon so I take to where I live and carried her to the living room and put her on the couch and unbuttoned her and she had shots through the left shoulder and the right hip slightly but she was gonna make it 

I removed both bullet's and patched her up with first aid kit and bandages 

The blood stop and she layed 


The following items she had on her was a photographer camera and her hand bag so I figured since was asleep I looked for her ID 

And she said 

IF YOUR LOOKING FOR MY ID DON'T BOTHER I LEFT IT AT HOME 

I asked ma,am what's your name 


She breathed heavily and said 

JESSICA

JESSICA SHUCLK

and she passed away on my shoulder 

I was up with tears in my eyes soken wet🥹



She looked like this broad 80s woman with long lushes beautiful and pretty eyes like princess Diana

1jh513j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jh513j,Marriott Washington Dulles Airport – Once and (Hopefully) Never Again,"Due to an unexpected flight change (and because I wasn’t about to give up my Swiss First Class seat), I ended up spending two nights at the Marriott Dulles Airport two weeks ago. I booked a Deluxe King Room on the third floor with a courtyard view.

I honestly don’t know how to say this, but I was a bit shocked by the facilities. And no, the excuse “it’s just an airport hotel” doesn’t work – ever stayed at the Hilton Munich or Frankfurt Airport? That’s the standard I’d expect.

What was good?

The staff was extremely friendly and went out of their way to accommodate me. Late check-out until 5 PM? No problem!
The room was in good condition—clean and comfortable.

What was not good?

The gym is a joke. Two weight benches (too close together to use properly), a couple of cardio machines—basically useless for any real workout.
The lounge was a disaster: espresso machine broken, only plastic cups, no diet sodas available.
The breakfast in the main restaurant was way too greasy—though to be fair, the staff was kind enough to make me a custom omelet.
The bar … whatever you do, don’t order an Espresso Martini. What I got was basically a milk coffee in a martini glass with way too much vodka.

Bottom Line:
I would never voluntarily stay here again. If you have no other choice, it’s tolerable for a single night—but if there’s an alternative, take it.

1jh4yrq,https://www.facebook.com/share/p/164PX9yhKt/,Flip out Somerset discrimination,"I very rarely share information online or write reviews (especially negative ones), as I tend to deal with issues privately. 
This situation however, I feel needs to be sent around the nation, if not the world.

As many parents will know, children love activity centres to burn off energy, meet new friends and enjoy equipment most homes can't fit. So it was no surprise when my child announced he wanted a Flip Out party for his 5th birthday. 

Despite the extortionate cost, we were determined to make it happen and booked the Friendzy session for 10 children (Paying extra for adults to supervise, despite it being mandatory).

Upon entrance, we all easily signed in, signed waivers and some even got a detailed explanation of the waiver from the multiple staff and supervisors in the otherwise empty reception area. 

We found a table and set the children free to bounce to their hearts content. After waiting a long wait for expensive, sub-par coffees, we all took in turns checking in on the children. 

All was fine until my 12 year old brother was seen to be marched off the trampoline area by a male supervisor. Obviously this set off alarms and myself and my mother approached to find out what was going on. 

The reason given for dramatically marching a child off? 

He has Down Syndrome. 

Not only did this 'supervisor' declare this, nearly 3/4 of the way through the session, but he also informed us he was never allowed to be there without specific paperwork. 

We knew this, had already discussed this at check-in, and was told by multiple staff that signing the waiver was all we had to do. Hence us carrying on.

This quite obviously riled us, embarrassed my brother, but also caused a scene for all others to spectate. Why was this suddenly a problem? After over half way through, now it was a problem? 

I ignored the pretentious, derogatory comments from the young, uneducated, immature 'supervisor', and took my brother back out to bounce.
We were followed, stalked and sneered at by multiple members of young, immature staff. I even apologised to the supervisor for any misunderstanding, but I wasn't going to allow my brother to be humiliated in front of all the spectators and children. He was 12 years old, soon turning 13. He is a typical, self conscious teenager and he takes everything to heart. To embarrass him, because he is different (which he already knows) is disgusting. Not only that, but to show him those differences are not good enough to be involved in society, well not on my watch. 

After playing for another 20 minutes or so, under much scrutiny from staff, we sat for a drink and break. We were then informed that, after discussing with their general manager, they had to call the police.

Their reason for wasting police time? ""A 12 year boy with Down Syndrome is trespassing, we need you to remove him"". I'm sorry but what? We paid to be there, signed the waiver as instructed and he's trespassing?

What is an even bigger shame is that this caused my brother to withdraw into himself. He had been having a great time, being included into a random group of children he'd never met and now because he is different, he must leave. He finally had confidence to make friends on his own, with a similar age range to himself, and we were so proud! And that all went down the toilet as soon as the 'supervisor' decided to be a bully. He bullied my brother, my mum, and myself. So much so that another group, completely separate to us, witnessing this bullying, walked out and reported it. 

After my mum and brother left early, I very much lost my temper. This bully discriminated against my family, got a power trip from them leaving and then hid in the office. I asked multiple members of staff for the supervisors names, complaints procedures and a manager to liase with. All was met with aggravated ignorance. Apparently none of them have to declare their job role, help with complaints or know of a manager. Very convenient.

I went outside to get some fresh air and calm down, to which I was greeted by a police officer collecting statements from the two 'supervisors'. This infuriated me and I waited my turn to speak to them.

After getting their side, the police officer came to me to collect my perspective of events. 

I was informed that she had Blue lighted her way over, not to come protect these children supposedly in charge of the establishment, but because of the terminology used by them had been so alarming they were coming to protect us. They used such discriminatory language, they were disgusted. Along with the fact the only reason they could give was, ""well he's got Down Syndrome, what else do you want?"". 

The police then informed me that this was nothing against me or my family. But in fact they were turning it on to Flip out as Discrimination against protected characteristics. This is a hate crime and is protected by law. 

Upon speaking to the police, another officer arrived. He also was disgusted by their actions and words and wanted to help us. He advised me to email my complaint to Flip Out, which I did. And to say the response I received was dismal is the understatement of the century. 

I was told by the Franchise owner, it was ""morally commendable for the supervisor to approach us"". By even the lowest of standards, there was nothing moral or commendable about this completely avoidable situation. 

So I've waited. Gathered my research and waited for World Down Syndrome day. Hopefully the influx of love, information and adoration for Down syndrome today may reach any of these inferior little power trips and maybe even teach them some form of human empathy or decency.

Upon my research, other people reaching out and giving sympathy, I've found this isn't an isolated incident. This form of hate crime and discrimination is a regular occurrence at Flip Out Somerset, and other across the country. 

One person attended a SEN session there, and his 2 autistic children were told to shut up and sit down or they will be forcibly removed. Others with Down Syndrome have been turned away at the door, for no reason other than having an extra chromosome. This is disgusting behaviour and a major issue in our community. Nobody should be excluded, discriminated against or embarrassed for being different. Everyone is equal and these franchises need to realise this cannot carry on. 

I want answers, change and I want a refund for my troubles too. 

I hope this warns others to steer clear of this establishment, and I hope these staff members get treated the same way some day. Because maybe then they might just learn how it feels.
My brother may be different to others in the general population, but all that extra chromosome does is making better than everyone else. 

If anyone takes anything at all from this, i hope it's this; be more like him. Because if you do try to reach his level, your life will be infinitely better for it.

Happy world Down Syndrome day! May we all strive to be better and a little more like these incredible humans we have been blessed with! 💙💛",4,1742636998.0,Somerset,1,0.75,False

--------------------------------------------------

Milk thistle tea is a delightful herbal beverage known for its numerous health benefits, especially for liver support. If you’re curious about how to make this tea, you’re in the right place. Below, you'll find a detailed guide to prepare milk thistle tea easily at home.

Milk thistle comes from the milk thistle plant, which has the scientific name Silybum marianum. This plant's seeds are used to make the tea, and they are rich in a compound called silymarin, known for its powerful antioxidant properties. Making milk thistle tea can be a cozy and health-boosting experience.

Here’s what you need to make your own milk thistle tea:

Get The Milk Thistle Ebook Here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O\_LTdY\_WFQel6IMKCBiZ8nxcvTOHYMkFiA4Z1ioGwjo/edit?usp=sharing  
  
- 1-2 teaspoons of milk thistle seeds (whole or ground)
- 1 cup of water
- Optional: sweeteners like honey or sugar
- Optional: lemon or ginger for added flavor

Now, let’s walk through the steps to create a heartwarming cup of milk thistle tea.

**Step 1: Prepare the Seeds**

Get The Milk Thistle Ebook Here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O\_LTdY\_WFQel6IMKCBiZ8nxcvTOHYMkFiA4Z1ioGwjo/edit?usp=sharing  
  
If you have whole milk thistle seeds, it’s best to grind them slightly. Use a mortar and pestle or a coffee grinder to break them up. This helps to release the beneficial compounds during brewing. You don’t need them to be a fine powder; a coarse grind is sufficient.

**Step 2: Boil Water**

Get The Milk Thistle Ebook Here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O\_LTdY\_WFQel6IMKCBiZ8nxcvTOHYMkFiA4Z1ioGwjo/edit?usp=sharing  
  
In a small pot, bring one cup of water to a boil. Make sure to use fresh water for the best taste. You can also use filtered water if possible, as it enhances the overall flavor of the tea.

**Step 3: Add the Seeds**

Get The Milk Thistle Ebook Here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O\_LTdY\_WFQel6IMKCBiZ8nxcvTOHYMkFiA4Z1ioGwjo/edit?usp=sharing  
  
Once the water is boiling, remove it from heat. Carefully add 1-2 teaspoons of the ground or whole milk thistle seeds. If you want a stronger flavor, you may increase the amount of seeds slightly.

**Step 4: Steep the Tea**

Get The Milk Thistle Ebook Here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O\_LTdY\_WFQel6IMKCBiZ8nxcvTOHYMkFiA4Z1ioGwjo/edit?usp=sharing  
  
Cover the pot and allow the mixture to steep for about 10-15 minutes. The longer you steep, the stronger the flavor will become. If you like your tea robust, aim for the longer steeping time. Alternatively, if you prefer a milder taste, keep it closer to 10 minutes.

**Step 5: Strain the Tea**

Get The Milk Thistle Ebook Here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O\_LTdY\_WFQel6IMKCBiZ8nxcvTOHYMkFiA4Z1ioGwjo/edit?usp=sharing  
  
After steeping, it’s time to strain your tea. Use a fine mesh strainer or a tea strainer to separate the seeds from the liquid. Pour the tea into your favorite cup, and be careful to catch all the seeds.

**Step 6: Enhance the Flavor**

Get The Milk Thistle Ebook Here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O\_LTdY\_WFQel6IMKCBiZ8nxcvTOHYMkFiA4Z1ioGwjo/edit?usp=sharing  
  
If you want to add sweetness or flavor, this is the time to do so. A teaspoon of honey or sugar can complement the earthy taste of milk thistle tea nicely. You can also squeeze in some lemon juice or add a slice of ginger for an extra zesty touch.

**Step 7: Enjoy Your Tea**

The Health Benefits of Drinking Milk Thistle Tea
------------------------------------------------

Milk thistle tea is gaining popularity as a delicious and beneficial herbal drink. With its vibrant history and a long list of health benefits, this tea is made from the seeds and leaves of the milk thistle plant, scientifically known as Silybum marianum. Consuming milk thistle tea can be a great way to enhance your wellness routine. Here’s why you might want to consider adding this unique beverage to your diet.

Get The Milk Thistle Ebook Here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O\_LTdY\_WFQel6IMKCBiZ8nxcvTOHYMkFiA4Z1ioGwjo/edit?usp=sharing  
  
One of the most notable benefits of drinking milk thistle tea is its support for liver health. The active compounds found in milk thistle, particularly silymarin, are known for their powerful antioxidant properties. These antioxidants help protect liver cells from toxins and aid in the regeneration of damaged liver tissues. If you're looking to detoxify or support your liver function, incorporating milk thistle tea into your daily regimen could prove beneficial.

Furthermore, milk thistle tea may help improve digestion. It works by stimulating bile production, which is essential for the digestion of fats. If you often experience digestive discomfort, sipping on milk thistle tea could provide relief and promote a smoother digestive process. The soothing qualities of this tea can also assist in alleviating bloating and gas.

Another positive aspect of milk thistle tea is its potential to fight inflammation. Chronic inflammation can lead to various health issues, including heart disease and arthritis. The anti-inflammatory properties of milk thistle can help mitigate these risks, providing your body with a natural defense against inflammatory responses.

In addition to its liver and digestive support, milk thistle tea could also assist in maintaining healthy blood sugar levels. Some studies suggest that silymarin can improve insulin sensitivity, helping to regulate how your body processes sugar. For those who are pre-diabetic or looking to manage their blood sugar levels more effectively, this tea may be a helpful addition to your diet.

Milk thistle is also known to have potential benefits for skin health. The antioxidants present in milk thistle may contribute to reducing acne and other skin irritations. By drinking milk thistle tea regularly, you might find that your skin looks healthier and more radiant over time. Hydration from the tea itself also plays a role in keeping your skin supple.

Why should you choose milk thistle tea over other herbal teas? For starters, it offers a unique flavor profile. With a slight bitterness reminiscent of its botanical roots, this tea can be enjoyed plain or sweetened with honey or lemon juice to suit your taste. Here’s a simple way to make milk thistle tea at home:

Get The Milk Thistle Ebook Here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O\_LTdY\_WFQel6IMKCBiZ8nxcvTOHYMkFiA4Z1ioGwjo/edit?usp=sharing  
  
- Start with 1 to 2 teaspoons of dried milk thistle seeds or leaves.
- Boil 1 cup of water in a small pot.
- Add the milk thistle to the boiling water, lower the heat, and let it simmer for about 10 minutes.
- Strain the tea into your favorite mug, sweeten if desired, and enjoy!
- You can drink this tea 1 to 2 times a day for maximum benefits.

As with any herbal remedy, moderation is key. While milk thistle tea is generally safe for most people, excessive consumption can lead to potential side effects such as gastrointestinal upset. Always consult with a healthcare provider before adding new herbal supplements to your routine, especially if you have underlying health conditions or are pregnant.

Milk thistle tea offers a wealth of health benefits that may enhance your well-being. From supporting liver health and aiding digestion to combating inflammation and promoting radiant skin, this herbal tea is a remarkable choice.

2. He’s way too cocky – He thinks he’s got the Black Lodge all figured out with his coffee and Tibet theories, but he plays right into its hands. The dude ignores every warning.


3. Terrible detective work – He had all the clues, but it takes forever to solve Laura’s murder. Hell, he basically stumbles into the answer.


4. He doesn’t learn sh*t – He messes up, gets trapped, and when he finally gets out? He does the exact same thing again. That last scene isn’t a hero’s journey—it’s a man doomed by his own arrogance.

Ive been getting this horrible sensation for the past month which is very hard to describe, and I can’t find anything on Google that suggests what it could be. It almost feels like my brain is deeply exhausted - even if I have slept well. There’s a sensation as if my mind is slipping gears, or like it’s a train on a track that’s falling off the track. It comes on perhaps 8-10 times a day, perhaps a few times a week. If I’m out I feel like I struggle to stay up and talking to people, and want to just sit down and shut my eyes. Like my brain needs to sleep.

Last year I tapered off an SSRI - Lexapro. I had been taking 10mg for nearly 11 years. The taper took close to 6 months. I have been completely off the SSRI for 5 months. This symptom only started a month ago so I’m not sure if it’s linked. It’s also not the same symptom as brain zaps which I got when I have tried to come off SSRIs before.

I also gave up coffee last year. I only had 2/3 cups per day. I drink caffeinated tea still. Again not sure if this could be linked?

Any ideas what this might be? I feel stupid going to my GP about it (if I can even get an appointment in my country). It is however making life challenging at times.

1jh4mo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1jh4mo8/over_30_days_of_almost_no_pvcs/,Over 30 days of almost no PVCs!,"I posted last time where I had 36 hours of no PVCs, well, on day 3 I had 1 or 2. But since then I've had none. The funny part was, the 1-2 I had were immediate and it happened when I opened a ziplock bag from back home. This further solidifies my belief the PVCs were a result of environmental issues from where I was living. Either allergies or perhaps someone in the building was smoking meth and it seeped in.

I even started to drink coffee again! I'm also taking part in Ramadan where I'm fasting, dry fasting, and sleep deprived. Still no PVCs the entire time.

Living in Utah I'd had periodic heart issues in every place I'd lived in for a prolonged period of time. But this last bout was intense. Every day, multiple times per day, and for some reason my left eye would twitch randomly. Only my left eye and never at the same time as the PVC.

The doctors told me things I didn't like hearing. If they're benign, fuck it, I can do whatever. And even if it kills me, that's ok, I've lived a good one, and living like this is unacceptable. So I moved out of Utah and I got wicked sick multiple times. I had a temp of 103 for 2 days, I got pink eye in both eyes and two ear infections. The first few places I stayed at were pretty dirty, moldy/mildewy, etc.

That said, even in one of the moldy places my eye twitching went away. That was my first positive sign. It probably took 1 months before the eye twitching subsided. Then a few weeks after that I started getting warm shooting feelings down my arms. The doctors here said it wasn't a problem since there was no tingly, so probably not neuropathy. I asked different AIs what it was and it told me my vagus nerve was doing something. Who knows. The warm shooting feeling didn't coincide with my palpitations and for a long time I didn't think they were correlated.

One day I was standing in line, having PVCs, and then BAM, I had the warm feeling and my PVCs went away immediately. A few days later my PVCs almost entirely went away, and I still had that warm shooting feeling.

Now, the warm feeling has mostly gone away. I rarely feel it. I don't know what it was.

The air pollution here is significantly worse than Utah and I get less exercise. My diet is almost identical, more meat and eggs, less tofu, but other than that I eat the same stuff. I've always ate pretty healthy. I still think about it and what it could have been, what could have triggered it and why it went away. There's no answer key for me to look and and say, ""Ah, it was DEFINITELY environmental,"" but given the facts that was almost certainly the case.

It could be a lot of things though. Maybe ozone was super high? Maybe the low concentration of oxygen exacerbated an allergic reaction to something. Maybe my neighbors were smoking meth. It's tough to pinpoint, but I just thank god I don't have to deal with it right now. That said, when I move again I'm going to wonder if all the stuff I have in storage is a ticking time bomb.",3,1742635458.0,PVCs,0,1.0,False

I hope this post can inspire some of you and help me in my quest.
I've been single for a few weeks and I realize that, like in all the relationships I've been in, I've let myself down a lot. Today, I want to relearn how to live for myself, I want to have fun, to meet people (in a friendly way) and to fight against my fear of being alone too. So I do a lot of things on the weekends by myself, and I have to admit that sometimes it's tiring. I would like to either vary my activities (I hike, I go for coffee, I read and write, I do puzzles, I cook, I walk in town and go shopping, I listen to music, watch films and series, I go to eat alone sometimes then I also go to the cinema alone) or give myself the opportunity to meet people. I think of my cousin who went to clubs several times by herself and I don't think I'll get to that stage either. The bar would already be good.

Just received a Tsubami 185 for my birthday and see very different  opinions on best doses and capacity for the 155 and 185.

So question is,  if I normally brew 12 to 18g doses, is the 185 right for me?

Phrased differently,  does the Kalita require more coffee per cup than a cone brewer or simply bigger minimums because of the bed and architecture?  Are cone brewers just more flexible in the doses they can handle because of the geometry?

Little confused after reading conflicting posts.

If the Tsunam 185 can do really good 18g/300ml cups and up, I can live with it and use my 02 V60 or my Timenore B75 for smaller servings. 

If I really fall in love with it, I guess I can eventually add  a glass or copper155 to the collection.

Oh, and what would be a simple recipe to start?

Thanks all.

I have just one baking dish and don't really know its size, but butter fitted into it nicely (I thought). No gap on top, I was under impression that the cake will look the same after baking as it was before I'm terms of volume. 

But it had escaped terribly, like half of the butter got out of the dish( and after 55 mins of baking the middle of the cake was totally liquid. I baked it for 2 hours, after that it solidified. 

So

2. Why did the cake raise so much? There is no yeasts involved...

The ketogenic diet has taken the nutrition world by storm, promising weight loss and improved metabolic health through strategic carbohydrate reduction. As many keto enthusiasts embark on their low-carb journey, one burning question frequently arises: can you have diet soda on keto? While the zero-calorie beverage might seem like a perfect fit for a diet focused on minimizing carbohydrate intake, the reality is more complex. Diet sodas present a nuanced challenge for those following a ketogenic lifestyle, with potential implications for both metabolic health and weight loss goals. Click here to learn more for a healthier you: https://customketodiet.myofferdeals.com

Understanding Diet Soda and Ketosis

Diet soda might appear to be a keto-friendly beverage at first glance, but the truth requires a deeper examination. Most diet sodas contain zero net carbs, which initially seems ideal for maintaining ketosis. However, the artificial sweeteners and other ingredients can potentially impact your metabolic state and overall health goals.

Nutritional Breakdown of Diet Soda

**Key nutritional considerations for diet soda on keto include**:
- Zero calories
- Zero net carbohydrates
- Artificial sweeteners
- No nutritional value
- Potential metabolic complications

Click here to learn more for a healthier you: https://customketodiet.myofferdeals.com

The Impact of Artificial Sweeteners

Artificial sweeteners in diet sodas can trigger surprising metabolic responses. Research suggests that these chemical compounds might:
1. Potentially disrupt insulin sensitivity
2. Create cravings for sweet foods
3. Negatively impact gut microbiome health
4. Potentially interfere with ketone production

Potential Health Concerns

While diet soda might not immediately kick you out of ketosis, several health concerns warrant careful consideration:

**Metabolic Complications**
Some studies indicate that artificial sweeteners could:
- Increase insulin resistance
- Disrupt gut bacteria balance
- Potentially slow weight loss progress

Alternatives to Diet Soda on Keto

For those seeking hydration and flavor without compromising their ketogenic goals, consider these **keto-friendly beverage alternatives**:
- Water with fresh lemon
- Unsweetened sparkling water
- Herbal tea
- Black coffee
- Electrolyte-enhanced water

Click here to learn more for a healthier you: https://customketodiet.myofferdeals.com

Expert Recommendations

Most nutrition experts recommend limiting or avoiding diet soda while following a ketogenic diet. The potential negative metabolic impacts outweigh the temporary satisfaction of a sweet, fizzy drink.

Moderation is Key

If you choose to consume diet soda occasionally, consider these guidelines:
- Limit intake to 1-2 servings per week
- Monitor your body's response
- Stay hydrated with water
- Focus on nutrient-dense beverages

Psychological and Behavioral Considerations

Diet soda can create psychological dependencies that might undermine your keto goals. The sweet taste could trigger cravings and potentially disrupt your nutritional strategy.

Click here to learn more for a healthier you: https://customketodiet.myofferdeals.com

When to Avoid Diet Soda Completely

Certain individuals should be especially cautious about consuming diet soda on keto:
- Those with insulin resistance
- People with digestive sensitivities
- Individuals experiencing weight loss plateaus
- Those with specific health conditions

Scientific Perspective

Emerging research continues to explore the complex relationship between artificial sweeteners and metabolic health. While definitive conclusions are still developing, current evidence suggests caution and moderation.

Conclusion

Navigating diet soda consumption on a ketogenic diet requires careful consideration of individual health goals and metabolic responses. While technically zero-carb, diet sodas present potential complications that might interfere with optimal ketogenic outcomes. Prioritizing whole, nutrient-dense beverages and maintaining a balanced approach will support your long-term health and wellness objectives most effectively.",1,1742632697.0,customketodiet1,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone,

I want to show you my Practice Flirting app.

For the past 4 months I worked on this revamp and the app was approved on the App Store two days ago on the first go.

**How did I come up with the idea?**

Last year while I was looking for a new app to build I found lots of Reddit posts where people were asking about ""How to practice flirting"" or ""How to flirt"". Most of the posts had a ton of engagement and I thought that it might be a good opportunity to build an app which helps people with this problem.

The first version of the app was not great, but I got 4 customers and made $94. Two paid monthly and 2 paid for the yearly subscription.

**What problem does the app solve?**

Online dating apps are ""broken"". You either get no matches or if you somehow match you are ghosted or you have no clue how to avoid an awkward conversation.

We have to learn how to engage better in offline and online conversations.

**How does the app solve the problem?**

* There are over 120 structured video & text lessons, each with multiple questions. On each response you receive feedback and if you still have things to clarify you can ask an Ai tutor questions about the lesson.
* Real-world scenarios with voice practice. Multiple scenarios like coffee shop meeting or at the dog park etc. You have a goal and some tasks. Don't worry If you get stuck during the conversation, you can ask for hints. During the conversation an Ai analyzes your emotions through your language and at the end of the conversation you will receive a beautiful report which you can use to improve, see strengths or fix your weaknesses.
* 3 Daily challenges with different difficulty levels.
* Stats screen where you can see progress

I have a ton of ideas on stuff to do in the app, but I ll implement them slowly. Now I'm trying to get feedback from users.

The app is behind a paywall after sign in, because it might have Ai APIs cost. If you feel the subscription is too expensive or cannot afford DM and I'll make your account paid in exchange for feedback ( Make sure you don't hide email when you sign in so I can find you in the db )

Looking forward to your feedback.
