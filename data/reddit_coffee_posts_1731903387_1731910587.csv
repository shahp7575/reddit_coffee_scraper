1gtybs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Capri_Scrumptious/comments/1gtybs0/modern_family_fave_vs_most_annoying_characters/,Modern Family - Fave vs most annoying characters? List them! ,"I have insomnia so I rarely sleep through the night and I particularly cannot sleep if there is no background noise. 

This is how I ended up watching Modern Family. I shot through the entire show and all the seasons and now have re-watched it dozens of times as I try to sleep (and inevitably fail). 

Despite the fact I’ve watched it so many times, I really like the show and now I cannot sleep without hearing the Pritchett/Dunphy/Delgado family voices in the background 🤣

Despite my comfort and love for the show, I do have issues with it. Certain actions and developments of characters are a tad annoying or discomforting.

Now, I’m going to start being really picky here because otherwise I wouldn’t be able to see past my bias and love for the show -

1. Character Development 

Alex Dunphy - I was really upset with the progression of her character. I feel like as a child she was a very complex character. She was very smart and nerdy and completely different to Hailey. What made her a complex character is she didn’t fit the typical nerd stereotype, she was confident and had the same if not better bite that her ‘mean girl’ popular big sister had. She took it, but she could also give it. This was partly because again unlike the nerdy stereotype, she appeared very confident that she was smarter than her sister and fundamentally better because her brain was better. Despite this as she grows (in the early days) there was times when we saw beneath the mask and saw that despite appearing as condescending to her big sister hailey, she actually yearned for her love and closeness. For example, her favourite chats were the night time chats when she thought hailey was listening to her and giving advice. Another one is when they think they nearly die in the car accident and she thought that hailey was worried about losing her and she spends the entire day with hailey doing stuff she likes out of happiness. And another example is when she takes hailey’s advice at her graduation speech and when she gets jealous of the Little Sister programme hailey does. Lastly, the example where she pretends her teacher is not in for her music lessons so she can spend the day with hailey and her friend. She acts like she doesn’t want to be there, but in reality she wanted to be with hailey.

I would have loved to see their relationship develop more from this as the two girls mature. Instead, as Hailey begins to soften to Alex and actually make an effort Alex’s reaction is to turn into a self-centred pretentious character that sees herself as above not just Hailey but too good for the WHOLE FAMILY. where was this little girl who lied about her class to get a day out with hailey when she refused to spend time with Hailey, Luke and Phil on her senior ditch day. She wanted to ditch them all to go excitedly pick her new intelligent on her level roommate so she could get away from stupid ditsy Hailey and the family. Hailey was so upset by this and you could see that she was scared Alex was going to abandon her and never speak to her ever again. This was almost akin to the little peaks we saw into Alex’s psyche back in the day. But alas, now hailey is trying to  by to cultivate a closer relationship and Alex wants none of it. If it was just one time thing I’d understand but this becomes Alex’s attitude even more as she grows. 

I would have loved to see that as the two matured they could have become a lot closer. The friction could still have existed and little quabbles could have gone on (if the writers needed this for comedic effect). But I think this would have been still representative of genuine siblings. However, they could have also built up on the genuine ways the two were similar and the areas that overlapped. Alex could have shown and grown some respect for Hailey, even if just for her differences that Alex couldn’t relate to. Alex didn’t have to grow up to a person who genuinely puts herself on a pedestal as soooo much above Hailey no matter what. Even when Hailey starts doing well in work and creating a career, Alex finds a way to denounce her achievements by criticising and patronising her company. She doesn’t even acknowledge that she took Hailey’s ‘advice’ for her interview and it worked better than what she had planned. 

I have similar issues with the development of Hailey’s character too, but not in this area. I feel like as Hailey grew, her love and appreciation for her family did too. You see her attempts to try and make things right with her parents, siblings and wider family. You see her slowly come to realise how important they are and she makes efforts to maintain those relationships (even if she goes about it wrong or ends up messing things up). My issue with her growth is the fact that I think they maintained the ‘boy crazy’ thing far too long and put her in a relationship with literally every new character that was male and between the ages of whatever age she was and maybe like 40. I also resent that they decided to self-fulfill her prophecy of being young, unwed and pregnant (WITH TWINS TOO). She deserved more respect than that, her story could have ended with twins but I don’t think it should have progressed the way it does. I personally wanted her with Andy, I think he should have been her one and only. But for me Dylan would have ‘done’ but I don’t like HOW they did it. Dylan was Hailey’s first love and it could have been a genuine lovely story of the two finding each other again and growing up together. It could have been a story of mutual growth, genuine love, shared history and staying together because they loved each other. But I feel like the writers got her into a messy and awkward situation which led to Dylan in her life again. Dylan and her dynamic showed very little growth and to me lacked genuine love. And finally, I don’t think that the two would have lasted any longer than any of her other relationships had she not been ‘trapped’ into it by the pregnancy. In my head, if Andy returned and pursued her and she was just saying Dylan… I think she would have dumped Dylan to be with Andy again. But the reason why this won’t happen now is because she’s pregnant with Dylan’s babies. She’s mentally given up now, just like her mother, she sees that she now has to marry him. Even the marriage part is so unromantic coming from the girl whose character revolved around romance. Dylan didn’t do anything to push the relationship forward either at this stage, he just did what ‘he was meant to do’ if he gets someone pregnant. Andy would have been far more romantic. They also say Dylan was Hailey’s ‘first love’ but I don’t think so. I think he was her first relationship, but Andy was her first love. Especially judging by the things she said, how she treated him and what she did when they were together. Andy made her legs weak, he blinded her to his nerdy/embarrassing quirks and he matched her intelligence. She never really looked down on him, controlled him or changed him. Dylan was like a puppy that followed her around and put her on a pedestal. He was convenient and helped her self-esteem. But she never looked at him with the same puppy dog eyes that blinded her to his embarrassing quirks just because she loved him. Instead, she uses a sound (beep beep or something) to fast forward him when he’s saying something stupid or embarrassing. Andy was as embarrassing and cringe, but she never treated him like that. Instead, she was blinded and filled with love so she ended up listening to him awwwing inside and cherishing his quirks that made him unique. I also think that they really did show how Andy made Hailey a better person and vice versa (from both of them helping eachother study, prepare for interviews, build confidence, believe in themselves, increases eachother self-esteem and embrace their own quirks and weaknesses) 

I wouldn’t have minded if it was Dylan either, but it’s the fact that they could have demonstrated her love for him and vice versa a little better. They could have shown us how she cherished his quirks, time and presence and how these actually made her a BETTER person (and vice versa). In contrast, Dylan does NOT make Hailey a better person. In fact, it in some ways made her a worse person and she embraced her ‘popular mean girl’ persona more often when influenced by Dylan. 🤔 but I wonder what you guys think? 

Cam - I love Modern family, but on some episodes Cam and his toxic, annoying, ‘pick me’, selfish, troublesome, spoilt behaviour just goes one step too far for my soul. Let me just clarify: I do see Cam as a vital part of MF and it wouldn’t be the same without him. However, I think loving to hate him is part of the character and I do indeed love to hate him. And realisticallly he is SO SELFISH and childish and sometimes it gets too much. Particularly the way he talks and acts towards poor Mitch. 

For example,

1. In a flashback - He SPECIFICALLY tells Mitch that he doesn’t want to do anything for his birthday

2. Mitch then plans a calm stay at home movie night for Cams bday. 

3. Instantly, Cam gets on the phone and when Mitch asks what’s wrong? Cam says ‘cancelling our baby’ and looks away in a mood. 

From the episode I’m watching right now - Mitch then goes out of his way to plan a big massive party for Cam (even though he once again said he wanted no big deal). Mitch based the party around Cam’s favourite show ever - Wizard of Oz. Only to realise (after the party has been planned, paid for and physically started coming together) this could be insensitive due to the recent tornado that hit cam’s hometown. 

Mitch then panics and ends up self-destructing 😭

Mitch puts together some alternatives (including a YACHT PARTY), but surprise surprise Cam is NOT IMPRESSED and starts jumping to conclusions, exaggerating, gas lighting and threatening Mitch. 

 Initially, Cam says he loves the Yacht because ‘it because none of our other friends have done it’

Then when he starts checking if said friends have arrived and finds that they couldn’t make it he slowly starts to HATE IT. 

So basically, he only liked it so he had an opportunity to show off how much better he is to his friends. He didn’t like it because Mitch put in so much effort for him, or that he could spend 1-2-1 time with his lovely husband and family or that he could have a unique experience on a yacht when other people can’t even afford water for their birthday. 

He then starts judging Mitch and jumping to conclusions around how many hours Mitch used in planning the party. When Mitch asks for a moment, cam says ‘Seeing what you did in 2 days, I can’t wait to see what you’ll do in a moment’

Then Mitch explains what happened and how many months of planning went into this Cam has no reaction. Instead, he goes into a meltdown about being 40 and then garnering the attention of everyone and sympathy of Mitch. I noticed that he does this a lot. When Cam and Mitch get into a confrontation often fuelled by Cam’s over exaggerations or selfish whims, Cam manages to end it after getting everything off his own chest or getting what he wants, by making Mitch feel bad. Once Mitch is sufficiently more concerned about Cam than he is mad at Cam for reacting in such a way, then Cam gets his way. He gets whatever it is that he wanted and Mitch is just happy that Cam has stopped crying or lashing out. 

This is just one example of sooooo many. The one that sticks with me is how abusive Cam’s sister is to Mitch and how she uses the letter Mitch did not send to terrorise him by threatening to tell Cam. She makes him give her all his earned credits (that he wanted to travel with) and then starts demanding more. When Cam found out HE DID NOTHING to hold his sister accountable. You’d think that if you found out your sibling was emotionally and physically abusing and threatening your partner behind your back to get what they want, you’d have a word with them and at the very least maintain some distance between the two. Instead, Cam hitches his wagon to his sisters and comes down hard on mitch. Cam and his sister then gas light him and use the entire situation to get his sister into their upstairs property instead of renting it out to paying tenants. 

Those kind of situations happened often and I’m not saying Mitch was perfect - he also had his fair share of areas he could work on. But the sad thing is a lot of his stupid actions were fuelled by fear of Cam’s unreasonable demands or overly emotional reactions and significantly swift judgment of anything Mitch could say. Even if Mitch was a saint, he was never going to get out of it as the good guy in any interaction with Cam. But Mitch was meant to be a real person and therefore by no means perfect. So he’d never be able to contend with the expectations Cam set out but failed to reach himself. For example:

1. Cleaning the kitchen - he would mess the kitchen by creating a disaster baking to his whims with Lily and then purposely leave it to Mitch to clean (after a full day of work when Cam wasn’t). He acts like Mitch is over reacting and tells him he will clean it when he’s home. Mitch manages to hold out and not clean it (despite his compulsion) and when Cam arrives home he goes in a strop that Mitch didn’t clean it and acts like a baby crying and whining whilst doing it and exposes that he did plan and manipulate Mitch based on his compulsions. 


2. The Mother’s Day thing - Mitch was being nice by making him breakfast in bed. Mitch wasn’t calling him a mother, but merely trying to reinforce that all the best things that makes a mother a mother are something that Cam embodies with Lily. He is nurturing, more maternal and closer to Lily in that way. But Mitch just can’t win and ends up in the receiving line of Cams distaste when in events out of control of Mitch the other parents at a park tell Cam to get into the Mother’s Day shot of a picture with Lily. Why did Mitch deserve to receive the conflict from Cam when he was not the one that did that?? 

3. Faking the breakup - Cam previously faked a break-up and told their friends he was dumped by Mitch. He went around to them and got all their sympathies and ensured everyone was on HIS side. Once he set the tone and ensured that all the friends were on his side and would remain on his side in the event of a breakup he then told them they were back together and hid it from Mitch. Years later Mitch finds out and then does something similar (but not quite as bad) and Cam acts like Mitch was the one out of line and does the whole cry cry whine whine forcing Mitch into a state of regret and sympathy. 

4. CAM HAS A BREAK UP BAG always readily packed. If that was my partner, I’d never be able to relax or feel secure. So is it any surprise that Mitch would then sometimes make mistakes based on paranoia or fear? He loves Cam and wants to plan a future together but he has a annoying underlying insecurity based on a very real threat that Cam can and will take off even from the slightest hint of pushback from Mitch to change the status quo - which is very much Cam dominant. What Cam says goes. EXAMPLE - Fizbo having to be a part of EVERYTHING. 

5. When Cam is in a bad mood, hungry, ill or otherwise not in his best mood then Mitch draws the short straw and ends up paying to the HIGHEST PRICE. For example, Cam is on a diet and very irritable. He forces Mitch into starving too and this leads to a wreckage to his career. Another one is when he is ill, not dying I’ll just a flu. Mitch wants to go to Lady Gaga (after looking after Cam & Lily all day and arranging babysitting). Cam refuses and verbally attacks Mitch before sleeping. He sleeps the entire way through as Mitch sneaks out (as if he is still a child with parents). Cam figures it out after he wakes up, but is angry at Mitch anyway. Another example is Cam bringing his Fizbo on holiday to the most romantic city - PARIS. WITH HIS PARTNER. Instead of planning to spend that with Mitch, he brings Fizbo. But whilst out and about, he ends up 
fnding out that Fizbo isn’t his original idea but rather a copycat in France. This has a damper on Cam’s mood and he ends up abandoning Mitch to pursue his Clownly affairs. It doesn’t end well for him and ultimately has a strop, whines and puts the burden on Mitch and essentially ruins his trip. But Mitch supports him and gets him back on track. But in the end, despite Mitch’s resistance Cam still got what he wanted and got the sympathy to avoid Mitch’s upset. 


These are just a few examples, but I could go on. I think I’ve written too much anyways I got carried away! I’ll be surprised if anyone reads all of this but it’s the first time I’ve got any of this down in writing. 

But anyways, just to clarify my favourite / least favourites change a lot and depend on the last episode I’ve seen. But in general, I have criticism for every character. But I still love them. 

I really like Hailey, but I think some aspects of her character development and some things she does is questionable. But her good sides are really endearing. Seeing her self-conscious that Alex will abandon her really touched my soul (maybe because I had a similar interaction with my siblings) and I also love that she became such a protective mother (jumping up a roof and through the window to get to her twin babies after being locked in). I liked seeing behind the facade of the popular girl and understanding that she actually is self-conscious and not a perfect princess. That she is self aware and understands that despite the image she puts out, she doesn’t think that she is the best thing since sliced bread. Whereas, Alex grew to be the opposite. On the outside she doesn’t exude the confidence that Hailey does, but when you see beyond the surface there is a level of elitism there. She thinks she’s so much better than everyone and looks down on anyone with less qualification, less intelligence or hired by a lesser known company. 

I find Gloria to be hilarious and some aspects of her remind me of my own mother (minus the exaggerated comedic aspects that turn her from a. Real person into a tv character). Perhaps, because my mum was an Irish Catholic and held similar cultural/traditional beliefs but also was a modern mother that doted on her children with a unexpected temper and over protection that would lead her to lash out and go to any extents to make sure her kids were wrapped in wool. My mum also would NEVER admit fault in a car accident and banged the car around everywhere and my dad dare not accuse her of bad driving 😂 a lot of those storylines resonated with me and I felt like Manny (whispering the truth when she wasn’t looking). 

Ultimately, it was her motherly nature that resonated with me and made me like her. The aspects I didn’t like so much was the over sexualisation of her as a character but I also didn’t hate it. It just didn’t resonate with me, but l guess it added another layer to her and made the character more interesting. 
So there was some times when I felt that they pushed her character just the bit too far (particularly with her obsession of Manny even after he began to grow up). 


My least favourite characters again are not necessarily because I HATE them but rather that they are predictable and not as complex. I’d say Cam fits into this and Dylan too (but I don’t hate him, I just struggle to connect with him and how he thinks. But we get less screen time with Dylan, so perhaps that’s why. How can I see beyond his surface when we get a few dumb sentences from him per few episodes). Cam is predictably self obsessed and it’s frustrating sometimes to see him run circles around Mitch and continuously have the world revolve around him and NEVER in any scenario let the spotlight be on someone else. I also found myself being bored or somewhat annoyed by Manny’s character after he started growing up. As a child, his habits were quirky and a bit weird but it made him unique. He actually reminded me a bit of my little sister who was a coffee enthusiast acting all posh and grown by 12. But as he grew up, he started becoming too pretentious and I don’t like how he went from being proud and confident about his background of less than fortunate means to being so far removed and disillusioned from that and having a temper with lower ranking members of society (for example, having a hissy fit and abusing his film crew when direction that movie). I also found it annoying how easily he fell in love and followed girls around like a harmless puppy even if they didn’t want him to do that. If you look from his POV, it’s just a bit annoying. But if you think of it from her POV (whoever she is) then it’s really annoying and somewhat creepy. Like jumping to marriage with his mime partner Canadian GF and then when she refuses he uses being her director in the Stella advert to basically torture her as a means of revenge. That was really out of order and contrary to the kind hearted wholesome romantic soft hearted idealistic person I thought he’d grow into. It certainly was not very poetic.

I also happened to dislike every member of Cam’s family. There were no redeeming qualities to any of them and the characters were not complex or dimensional at all. They were caricatures and didn’t deviate from the stereotypes we saw from day one. His mother was weird and didn’t respect boundaries or personal space. His father was just plain rude and judgmental (like Jay was on occasion) but didn’t face the same accountability that Jay faced or show the same level of care and underneath it al compassion that Jay demonstrated (granted he had less screen time, but they didn’t even attempt to) and grandma tucker was nasty to Mitch even in her death and racist to Lily (even though she liked her, she still made racist remarks). Don’t get me started on Cam’s sister. Out of all Cam’s family, she had the most screen time and therefore most opportunity to display more layers of her character but even when she appeared to do something nice (which even Cam did do nice, compassionate and nurturing things sometimes because he did have layers) in the end it always transpired to just be some kind of manipulation to get her way or get something she wanted. She was always angry, aggressive, scary and rude. She played around with Mitch like she was a dog and he was her toy bone and Cam just stood by idly and allowed her to play with her toy bone (Mitch). She should have been more grateful to Mitch, considering she got pregnant with a absentee criminals baby and had nowhere to go and Mitch / Cam let her stay for free with them in their upstairs apartment and supported her in pregnancy/early birth of her child. Mitch then agreed to help Cam raise his sisters baby when she went and got sent to prison (SO IRRESPONSIBLE) and even then after raising her child she thought she could treat Mitch like DIRT and wasn’t exactly an angel to Cam but really walked all over Mitch. Sometimes, Cam even contributed to it by relaying anything and everything Mitch said to Cam in confidence and often adding his own thoughts and opinions to the message and blaming Mitch. He would purposely tell his sister anything bad or conflictive that he felt by pretending Mitch said and anything nice Mitch said he would pretend he said it. All in all I just didn’t like her character, she wasn’t complex or interesting and was just there to help punch Mitch around and drag him through the mud. She didn’t have any redeeming features and I didn’t think her character or any of the input she had was funny - so the exaggerations that some of the other characters had (e.g Cam’s emotions, Gloria’s overprotectiveness, Phil’s compulsiveness or Luke’s stupidity) contributed to comedic effect and that made me okay with these sometimes over to the top exaggerations. However, Cam’s sister’s over exaggeration of her aggression and meanness didn’t do anything for me to contribute to the comedic effect of the show nor did it add any complex contradictory layer to the character that made it more interesting for me. 


Again, for the characters I listed as sometimes being my least favourites (e.g manny/Cam) I just wanted to clarify that I didn’t hate them. I did like them and I think every character (despite their flaws) were a important aspect of the cast and the show wouldn’t have been what it is if even one of them were missing (except maybe Dylan or Cam’s sister/whole family). However, these are just some aspects of the characters that I sometimes found myself frustrated with and wished some aspects of their character were fleshed out a bit better with some more nuanced and complexities that could have prevented some unnecessary over-exaggerations!!!

Wow 10 points to whoever reads all of this 🤣 I reckon no one will oopsie my thoughts just flowed out and now it’s 6am (blame this on insomnia modern family brain)

Afterward, I dress upstairs then get the building ready for the new day – a change in sound equipment, a microphone, unload and reload the chairs so they don’t fall over, clean upstairs and downstairs, throw out the garbage. I know there isn’t likely to be anyone around the building in the morning, so I head downstairs to the kitchen, mix up the ingredients for a loaf of wholewheat bread. This particular sponge is especially springy, a kind of ambition that bodes well for a fine crumb at the end. The dough is alive with the yeast, which is a fungus. If nature took its course, the fungi would feast on the dough forever more.

Which is what sourdough starter is, I guess. I’m drinking coffee now – I’ve started drinking a little bit of coffee now and then, after clearing it out of my system for a couple of months. The coffee tastes neither good nor bad, and I marvel at how steeped beans can become a subject of moral discourse. Coffee is a broth, a bean broth, and I wonder why it’s not used in soups more often, and I guess it’s because people don’t usually eat soup for breakfast. For lunch? Maybe now and then, a minestrone made with coffee instead of vegetable broth, for lunch. A gazpacho from cold coffee. But obviously no coffee soups for supper, unless its decaf, which some people have a problem with. How dare my chilli be denied its kick! I have a slurp of coffee, write about faith-based understandings in everyday life. Spiritual sources that empty us aren’t the ones that fill us. The two barely recognize each other. 

Across the street by the corner, two squirrels pop out of a thick bush, climb the stop sign, the wood beam to which the sign is affixed, to the top, such that the higher one stands high above it all, folds its forepaws together in that endearing way that implies patience and mutual regard, seems to gaze at me. I have an experience of deja vu – I believe these squirrels have done this before, and I stare down at the last thing I wrote – about an end to purgation, the beginning of a divine new form. Not this time, I tell the squirrels, then head home to check the size of the sponge. Sponges have climbed out of their bowls before, but fortunately, the one today is fine, never better. I knead the dough for a minute, then let it rest, while I relight the pilot for the stove. This adds a little heat to the inside of the oven to promote a second fungal civilization. Put the dough in the pan, and toss a towel over it.

Yesterday I wrote in support of a city subsidy for a Black-owned grocery store in a part of town with insufficient access to food – deserts, those neighborhoods are called, to call to mind the existential nature of the problem. Then I wrote to my U.S. representative who just voted to give the executive branch and the Treasury Department the power to nullify non-profit status, which would be a death sentence for a lot of current non-profit organizations. I remind my U.S. rep how culturally pluralistic we are as a district, how conflict anywhere in the world impacts people in our community. When it does, non-profits are the ones who keep the social fabric from unwinding. They need assurance the government isn’t going to decimate institutions across the U.S. just because fanatical opinions are simpler to communicate, rule the day. The bill will make another appearance in the coming months.

I’m making pasta to go along with, so while the bread is rising, I’m cutting up vegetables, deseeding a couple of squash, pouring red wine over it all in a great big cast iron skillet that’s like cooking food on a hot manhole cover but also the best way to cook it. I get it all going on the stove, then pop out to dump the vegetable remains in the composter, when a large piece of yellow onionskin floats into the air, does a loop, lands perfectly on my wrist, like a piece of royal jewelry for the prince of garlic. Moments later, drilling crews meet me in the parking lot, say the decision has come down from on high that the usual metaphorical potential of the onion – timewise transformation of the self – has been officially usurped by a metaphorical potential based on strata of the earth – hence the drilling crews here to extract more, ya know – resources. Cause the onion had spoken – the court’s words.

I give the onion skin a kiss, drop it in the composter along with any new sins, let the potential for all new frontiers open around me. In South Africa, state police are determined to arrest or deport the so-called zama zama, a Zulu expression for abandoned gold mine workers who engage in incredibly harsh and hazardous labor under the oversight of organized crime syndicates. Some workers spend years underground – literally years, no choice in the matter because there is a fee associated with being released from the mine, which is paid for in gold. The police had blocked off the entrances to the mine and refused to allow any more food or water to go down. Locals estimated the total mine population of zama zama at about four thousand – four thousand people underground, unwilling to return to the surface to face the police, who will also probably confiscate whatever gold they found.

I can’t fathom how bleak that is, so instead I think about the history of colonial industries, in which some standard of safety must be met, which allows only certain kinds of mining to proceed – when those industrial methods lose their profitability, the next economy steps in, no standard of safety to fall back on, no pubic discussion about the pay, and when that economy has run its course, there’ll be another after that, in which human beings learn to survive entirely on gold, and we will be born, live and die in the minds, I mean mines – mines are what I meant. But right, sure – minds, too. I add the pasta to the sauce, turn off the flame and stir it all together. I set the manhole cover to one side and take the bread out of the oven. The competent baker lets a loaf sit in the pan for a bit before it gets turned onto a rack, but I do it a little sooner than that. Two minutes later, I’m slicing the bread.

Students are in the chapel, not voting to revoke the peace church’s non-profit status, also practicing a play. I take a helping of pasta and a slice of fresh bread back to my loft, lose myself in the pleasure of hot fresh bread and spicy pasta. Leaves have mostly refilled the north lawn, and I had planned to walk to the hardware place to get an armload of leaf bags, decide instead to make a new art piece, inspired by a vision of nature and technology becoming one, which has probably already happened, but not in the way we thought it would. Nature and technology grow as one when extradimensional characteristics begin performing a phenomenology of technology without the need for any amount of ware, hard or soft. Perhaps we are living in a reality in which a mind is using the history of human innovation to make its own means of liberation. Even knowing this is still just part of the liberation.

Liberation! Stepping into the daylight for the first time in years! While our eyes readjust to the sun, moral order takes our gold, orders our arrest, our deportation.

It’s led me to some conclusions that are counterintuitive and perhaps in contrast to things I typically read. 

Some fairly well established concepts:
- as coffee is extracted by water, some compounds extract more readily and some are more difficult to extract
- lower extraction is associated with acidity, higher extraction is associated with both sweet and bitter compounds
- coffee grounds are only shallowly penetrated by water, so coarse grinds result in lower total extraction (lower TDS) and fine grinds result in higher total extraction (higher TDS)

Applying these concepts, I believe that fine grinding does NOT result in a flavor profile associated with high extraction, only that the cup has elevated TDS. Conversely, coarse grinding does not result in a low extraction flavor profile, it just has lower TDS. 

When people say they are unable to reach bitterness as they keep grinding finer, I believe them. TDS goes up, but local levels of extraction and flavor profile are likely not shifting to a more highly extracted outcome.

This is also why simply nailing an extraction yield percentage does not give the same flavor and is very much path dependent on dose and grind size to achieve the outcome.

1gtxwp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1gtxwp8/how_to_choose_the_perfect_sofa_for_your_living/,How to Choose the Perfect Sofa for Your Living Room  ,"A sofa is often the centerpiece of your living room, setting the tone for comfort and style. Choosing the perfect sofa isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s about finding a piece that complements your lifestyle, space, and needs. Here’s a guide to help you select the ideal sofa for your living room, with tips for finding high-quality [furnitures](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) from trusted [furniture stores](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture).  

**1. Assess Your Living Room Space**  

Before diving into designs, measure your living room. Think about the layout—how much space can you dedicate to a sofa without overcrowding the area? Consider other [home furnitures](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture), like coffee tables or armchairs, and how they’ll fit with your sofa.  

For small spaces, opt for a loveseat or sectional with a chaise. In larger rooms, consider expansive designs like L-shaped or U-shaped sofas. Always leave enough space for easy movement.  

**2. Define Your Style**  

Your sofa should reflect your style while harmonizing with the rest of your \*\*home furnitures\*\*.  

Modern Minimalist: Choose sleek, low-profile sofas with neutral colors.  

Classic Traditional: Opt for plush cushions, rolled arms, and timeless fabrics like velvet.  

Bohemian Chic: Look for bold patterns or textures that add personality to the room.  

When visiting furniture stores, visualize how the sofa will complement your living room's decor.  

**3. Choose the Right Material**  

The sofa’s material plays a huge role in its durability and appearance.  

Leather: Durable and easy to clean, leather is ideal for homes with kids or pets.  

Fabric: Offers a cozy feel and comes in various colors and patterns.  

Performance Fabrics: These are stain-resistant and perfect for high-traffic areas.  

Touch and feel different materials at furniture stores to find what suits your lifestyle.  

**4. Prioritize Comfort**  

Sit on the sofa before purchasing it. Is it firm or soft? Does the backrest provide adequate support? If you entertain often, ensure the seating is deep and plush. For smaller spaces, look for multifunctional sofas that can double as beds or have built-in storage.  

**5. Focus on Build Quality**  

A sofa is an investment, so prioritize quality. Check the frame—it should be made of sturdy wood or metal. Test the cushions for resilience. Reputable furniture stores will offer warranties, ensuring your sofa stands the test of time.  

**6. Match Colors and Patterns to Your Space**  

Neutral tones are versatile and work well with most home furnitures. However, if your living room needs a focal point, don’t shy away from bold colors or patterns. Complement these with textured throws and pillows to tie the look together.  

**7. Set a Budget and Shop Smart**  

Sofas come in a wide price range. Define your budget, but don’t compromise on quality. Many furniture stores offer sales or financing options, making it easier to invest in the perfect piece.  

**Final Thoughts**  

Choosing the right sofa is a balance of practicality and aesthetics. By understanding your needs and exploring options at trusted furniture stores, you’ll find a sofa that enhances your living room’s style and comfort. Remember, the right sofa can transform your space into a warm, inviting sanctuary for you and your loved ones.

1gtxsbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coconaad/comments/1gtxsbr/no_chaaya_please/,No Chaaya Please,"Well here it goes. I 32M was coaxed into a pennukaanal yesterday by my mom and aunt. The girls mother is my aunt's colleague and my mom and three of my aunts insisted they come. I have had very little experience with this charade, but off we went. My friend was supposed to pick us up in an innova, but his kid fell ill overnight and he had to bail. Which meant I had to drive this silk saree showroom to my own impending ignominy. We reached the place and I was pompously strodden into the house like the elephant in a procession.

After the stupendously monotonous introduction from my part, they called the girl in. She was on mode to serve tea and draw a map of Africa with her toes and such (hello 90's Malayalam movies). She then proceeded to serve me a cup which I accepted and promptly kept back on the table.

The thing is I hate tea. Not a chaaya person. At all. My parents tried. My relatives tried. Every time I'm served tea the person who came with me just had two. No chai sutta, no mazha chaya, no road-trip chaaya. Chaayakada visits mean kadi and coffee. During my last year of college I learnt to drink black tea. But that too I usually drink with some lemon or mint. I was diagnosed as lactose intolerant in 2018 so that provided some respite with the constant chaaya push, excusing that I can't drink milk.

After the customary talk with the girl cued by the ammavans on their side, I came back and sat down. Then the kaaranavar of the family enquired why I haven't touched the tea. Mind you the tea had gone tepid and had the layer of fat on top of it. Then I dropped the truth and the whole arena went silent. The girls dad was like ചായ കുടിക്കാതെ എങ്ങനാ, എന്റെ കുട്ടി ദിവസം 6 ചായ എങ്കിലും കുടിക്കും. I grinned sheepishly and tried to change the subject but to no avail. I looked at my aunt's and cued them to leave. On the way back I was barraged for not having atleast a sip of tea. I promptly told them that meant they had to wait in the car when I was fighting for my life in public toilets from Thiruvalla to Trivandrum.

1gtxow4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Danielasandov216/comments/1gtxow4/feelings_and_emotions_dont_matter_when_manifesting/,Feelings and emotions don't matter when manifesting,"(Sorry for the long text X'D)

I think, believe and know that feelings/emotions don't take a role at being able to achieve a desired outcome when it comes to manifesting (we can manifest having certain feelings/emotions, but they don't necessarily manifest something, although they can help us feeling it more ""real"", but also, feeling it ""real"" don't really manifest unless we manifest it to be that way, like: ""whenever I feel my visualization ""real/vivid"", it always manifests"").

We could be visualizing a certain scenario and imagine ourselves that we already have something without feeling anything, and still be able to manifest it, same thing happens with ""believing"", we don’t need to believe before having it because it doesn’t make sense, we only get to believe it’s true until we actually get it/see it/touch it/smell it/taste it/hear it/experience it. Sometimes, even if we already have something, we say “I can’t believe it”, like... it’s in front of you and you still don’t believe it, why do you expect to believe it if it’s not here (yet), then?

Actually, the more you visualize (assume) something is already true, the less feelings you get to have. Why? Because you already expect it to happen, now your subconscious mind considers it normal (sth that’s actually true and real happening right now).  

I'm going to make an example: you are very excited that you are going to get a new cellphone as a birthday present (that excitement represents that part of you that wants to have it), but then, when you get it and you already have it in your hands, you may don't feel anything, which is normal because the desire is not a desire anymore, it's here, right in front of you, you don’t expect to get it, because it’s already done and it’s part of your daily life.

That’s why even robotic affirming has worked for so many people, feelings/emotions are not involved, yet they still work.

Don’t get me wrong, you may be thinking “then if I get a feeling/emotion it won’t manifest because it’s coming from lack”, NO! It’s okay to get a feeling/emotion the first times we visualize sth because… we want it, right? We are going to feel accomplished when getting it but that's pretty much all; what I’m trying to say is that, whether you get a feeling or not, it doesn’t matter, cuz it’s normal you “lose” those feelings/emotions the more you visualize because now your brain considers it normal or a common thing you are now “experiencing”.

There are even habitual/vague/unimportant things we can manifest, that ofc is not related to feeling anything, for example, you can try to manifest that you are always the first person in a line and that you never have to wait to be served in a supermarket. Obviously, it’s rare you are going to feel very excited or happy if it happens, maybe as someone who’s a beginner in conscious manifestation, the first time you experience it, you are going to feel great, right? But the more you continue visualizing/manifesting/expecting to never wait in line, you are going to consider it normal and stop feeling something, because now it’s a habitual thing, nothing to be amazed of as it’s something you expect to happen, now it starts becoming sth common, sth that’s part of your life, then you are going to think sth like “yeah, I knew it was going to happen”.

What you actually need to manifest sth is your thoughts.

Thinking as if it’s alredy true.

Thoughts are the foundation of manifestation because they shape our perception and reality. When you consistently think as if something is already true, your subconscious mind begins to align with that reality.

For instance, let’s say you want to manifest financial abundance. You don’t need to feel euphoric every time you think about it, nor do you need to believe it instantly. Instead, you shift your thoughts to assume the perspective of someone who already has financial stability. This could be as simple as imagining yourself paying for something without hesitation or casually considering future investments. Over time, these thoughts become habitual, and your subconscious mind starts to act on them as if they’re facts.

It’s important to remember that manifesting isn’t about perfection or rigidity. There will be times when doubts or old patterns resurface, and that’s okay. The key is to gently redirect your focus back to the desired reality without resistance. You don’t need to micromanage the process or worry about every stray thought—what matters is the dominant thought pattern over time.

Here’s another example: imagine manifesting a free cup of coffee. At first, you might visualize receiving it and feel a little excited, thinking, “Wow, that would be amazing!” But after it happens a few times, it stops being surprising. You begin to think, “Of course, I always get free coffee,” and eventually, it becomes second nature. The same principle applies to bigger desires—the more you focus on them as if they’re normal and already part of your life, the less “special” they feel, and the more seamlessly they manifest.

The process doesn’t rely on how much emotion you pour into it but on the consistency and clarity of your thoughts. Your emotions can amplify the experience, making it feel more vivid, but they are not the core mechanism. When you approach manifestation with ease and confidence, trusting that your thoughts are powerful enough to create your reality, you unlock its true potential.

 

In summary:

·         Thoughts are the key: Thinking as if it’s already true is what creates the foundation.

·         Emotions are optional: They can enhance the experience but aren’t necessary.

·         Repetition builds normalcy: The more you think about something as true, the less ""magical"" it feels, which is a sign that your subconscious mind is integrating it into your reality.

·         Trust the process: Let your thoughts flow naturally, without forcing belief or attaching to specific emotions.

Manifestation becomes effortless when you align your thoughts with your desired reality and trust that what you think will eventually reflect in your world.",1,1731907816.0,u_Danielasandov216,0,1.0,False

Hi so me (F26) and my bf (M28) we are together for 5 years. Everything is perfect we live together for 4 years we are even planning to marry and have kids soon . When I met him he was a bit of a “bad guy “ he got lots of messages from girls when we were together and I ask him does his seeing somebody except me which he replied no.Most my friends told me I should not worry about who is he talking to because we are not in a relationship and that I’m being toxic and I should only care if he has a gf . He told me he don’t have a gf so we keep seeing each other for few months .


After some talking he opened up and told me he really want good caring girl and he wouldn’t need any other girls or even girl friends (I didn’t ask him that he just told me ) After 3 months of being just casual he asked me to be his gf and I said yes . Few days later he’s friends ask him did you brake up with ur gf( he didn’t know I was with him in the room) which he just laughs and told him he will call him later . I asked him about that and he told me it was just a joke I later met he’s friend and he told me the same story and he really has a weird humor .



 5 years later we were talking how we met and how stupid we were back then . And I asked him again about his friend question. He told me it’s eating him up for years but he is ready to tell me the truth . He told me he has a gf whole time while we were seeing each other (we were having sex at that time) I stayed shocked that broke me so much .I know he would never cheat on me he works go to gym and sleep sometimes coffee with friend but even that’s rare . He told me his gf back then was very toxic and he just wanted someone to care for him but he was too scared to brake up with her . Also they broke up 3 days before we started relationship she.At that time someone was constantly calling him and sending messy(probably her ) but he told me it was just a job . He told me he stoped having sex with her when he met me but I don’t really believe in that . What should I do? I fell like my whole life was a lie I can’t believe I was someone second option .

Hi everyone, I’ll try to make this as short as possible, I’ve (25F) had a group of friends since 2018 or so where we talk almost daily on discord and sometimes hangout irl, all but one guy with whom I always felt I had a bit of tension with (21M).

He broke off with the only girlfriend he’s ever had like 7 months ago, they were together for 3 years and was the reason why he wouldn’t come to the hangouts, plus he lives the most far away from us.
Almost two months ago we started talking more frequently until we arranged to go out just the two of us (again, nobody in the discord new him irl besides a chilhood friend), so we go out and turns out we have amazing chemistry.
Started going out almost every weekend until we get together with the whole group (guy friends he knew for years but never irl), that night he was like glued to me, never left my side and if we got all on a circle he’d move to be beside me, even if he was left out of it, he drank from my cup the whole night, etc.

From there we kept going out all except one weekend, everytime the outings are going to turistic spots, museums, the cinema, he once took me to an arcade cause he said he wanted to beat me in all of them, etc. Always alone but he tends to comment that a guy friend in particular should’ve come for x reason (although neither he or I invite him, never, we keep planning solo outings).

Every time we meet he brings me some kind of trinket (literally a trinket, today he brought me like a screw cap from an ac he and his dad installed this week, other times he brought me like brochure things of those that they hand you on the street but because they had my name on it, and so on), a few days ago we were talking about the clay things that I make and he asked me if I could make something for him but later told me no cause it was a gift he wanted to get me and realized I would be making my own gift.
When I smile at him he immediately smiles back. 
He talks to me every single day, with even the most silly excuses just to talk for a few minutes. Tells me I should post more photos of me, compliments my tattoos, asks me for advice on hair or clothes.
We watch movies almost every single day too, the rest of our friends stop logging on when there’s only us on the channel because they “don’t want to bother us”. 

Thing is today we went out for like six hours to go to museums and stuff and when we’ve ended the tour and was nighttime we went to grab a seat and he told me he should get going cause he had a long trip to his house, though he said that he just sat there, either in silence or asking me random things, like he didn’t wanted to leave. I asked him if the next time we meet was going to be already his birthday (his birthday is in two weeks and I’ve been making him a cloak his favorite character from his favorite book series wears, from scratch, so I’m pretty excited for that) and he told me ‘no, next week actually’ and I was like are you sure? and he saw the date, smiled and said ‘yeah, do you want to go out next week?’ and I told him of course. Then asked me if I wanted to grab a last coffee, and when we were waiting for it he says: I feel a bit awkward reposting the story you tagged me in today cause we’ve been going out every weekend and people will think you are my girlfriend. ??? (girlfriend instead of ‘dating’ is oddly specific)

I asked him why he care and he was like it’s an availability thing, idk (he was very shy about it) but it got me really confused because literally the last time we went out he told me that I should tag him so I’d save him the job of taking pictures of the outings since he sucked taking photos and I had a good eye (he reposted every single one).

According to a few friends since he only had one girlfriend and he’s very antisocial and shy he’s a bit scared of dating again and more knowing his ex still follows him (they broke up in good terms) so he’s either scared of what she may think or he wanted to seem like he’s talking to more girls? I really don’t know what to think. My best friend tells me he’s obviously interested because you don’t hang out with a female friend every weekend, even more when you have take an hour to get here and even more knowing he wants to gift me little things. Plus I’m a bit older than him so he might think I’m way out of his league?
I can’t ask him because I’m scared that in the worst case scenario he’s like this to me purely platonically and I’m the one mixing things up so he’ll stop talking to me if I confess my feelings. What do you think?",1,1731907619.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Alone In The Dark - McKenna Styles
I'm a 25 year old male, weighing 72 kg in fairly good health and physical condition.

I had decided to have a large dose of fresh shrooms, this time in a tea infusion form, 'cause I'd never tried it like this before. I'd read that the ""coming up"" phase is a lot more bearable, and less nausea-inducing when consumed like this. Using the Shroomery dosage calculator I aimed for a level 4 trip, meaning around 15 grams of fresh Psilocybe Subaeruginosa, which are the Australasian relative of Psilocybe Cyanscens, and at least as potent. I've read on the net that the potency of this species is on par with Psilocybe Cubensis by weight, but I strongly disagree; the ones in New Zealand are certainly more extreme! 

So I chopped up 15 large shrooms which I'd picked earlier that day, poured boiling water over them and let them soak for 5-10 mins. I strained the liquid through a coffee filter and poured another lot of water over the shrooms again. After doing this 3 times, I added some honey to the liquid to make it a little more pleasant. I tidied my room and made it nice and cosy, with the heater on low. 

After all, I had decided to sit in the dark naked, so I'd need something to prevent the ""shrivel"" phenomenon. I had decided to sit in the dark for the entire trip, with no distractions, so I could become fully immersed in the visions. I had a shower and got prepared with some relaxing cheesy music to create a peaceful environment, it had been a bit of a shit day and i needed to unwind first, otherwise there'd be hell to pay once the trip kicked in. 

I skolled back the first cup of liquid, then the second. I saved the third for 20 minutes later, as a booster. I felt noticeable changes almost immediately and felt a rush of anxiety kick in, nothing unusual when heading off on an intense excursion. This is where things get a little harder to describe. But I'll do my best. 

The 'peaceful' music I had put on, began annoying the shit out of me, so I turned it off. I felt the mushroom taking over, like some sort of alien spirit invading me. I could literally feel it seep in like someone had injected me with some sort of liquid spirit. It went up my arms and then into my head, slowly smothering my mind. I kinda felt like my brain was being 'stretched' slowly. After this happened, my alarm went off, and I skolled back the last cup of liquid. This is when the shivers came, followed by a hot flush. I turned the heater off, but was immediately too cold again. I turned it back on and sat in front of the heater naked, in the pitch black of night, with a howling wind and pounding rain outside. The weather seemed to be getting more dramatic as the trip itself became more intense. Now things were getting really strange… 

My breathing got real heavy and intense, and I took some really long deep breaths to try and relax. Now some faint colours began behind my closed eyes, they seemed to be far away from me though, approaching slowly like some sort of tidal wave, gradually increasing in colour and detail. All the effects so far had been similar to my previous trips. But this is where it took a completely different turn. My attention span seemed to be getting shorter and I felt compelled to open my eyes every now and then. 

This was interrupting the visions, which were trying to form. I found myself distracted by personal thoughts of my family, my friends, and my relationships with them. A lot of my other trips had been about insights into my life, but this time I wanted to know what the mushroom was ""without me"". I wanted to know what it was by itself, if that makes any sense. Mushrooms have always given me great wisdom into my life and my friends, but I'd also been aware that there was an 'otherness' to it, that it had a life of it's own, a consciousness of it's own. So I began repeating this to myself mentally…""I want to see you for what YOU are"". 

Immediately my head tilted back, eyes closed, and I was sucked upwards into my mind, my breathing becoming heavy and deep again. I tried to concentrate, and for a moment felt myself slipping away, giving way to something brighter, a vast and infinitely more expansive domain. This is when the ""jungle ferns"" started closing in. It was scary at first. There were large prehistoric looking fern leaves coming over and above me, creeping in like dark arms. They were blocking out the space above me, my head lowered, and I once again was immersed in thoughts of my own life and concerns. 

This physical reaction continued; my head lowering as I ‘dropped’, and titling back to face the ceiling when I was ‘pulled’ up. The vision paused as I contemplated friends and family. Then I remembered what I was trying to do and again asked to forget myself. This time I looked up again to the ferns, which had covered me. Now they began to part slightly, giving me a glimpse of the great space above them. It was like a combination of space, the sky, and what you might call heaven. But my mind was too distracted and I soon lost my focus. Note: these visions I describe were seen in my minds eye with my eyes closed, much like a dream. 

The jungle plants came over me again and I found myself down on the ground in the jungle. I was surrounded by all sorts of ancient life forms, the likes of which I've never seen in any books or movies. There was a large creature right in front of me, and it was hunched over another creature, which it had just killed. It was feeding ferociously on the carcass, blood spraying out and the sound of tearing flesh and snapping bone. It had a primate body, covered in hair, but with the wings of a great dragon. Then it looked at me, with glowing red eyes, and a bright red face that looked like it was on fire. This wasn't scary though, more captivating. I know this is only my interpretation, but I felt like this was my karma for not focusing on the vision; that I had been thrown down to dwell amongst the wild beasts of the prehistoric earth, to feed, kill, and mate like them. Real primal, basic survival stuff. 

Then the words ""pay attention, pay attention"" began repeating through my mind, and I felt like something was speaking to me, but not in words. It was encouraging me, calling me to come up above the forest canopy. I refocused and began my ascent upwards again. This time I really focused on the vision, and as the fern arms parted, a bright blue light began to seep through the darkness, opening up like curtains. It was trying to break through the black and again my head tilted back and I felt like something was lifting me skyward. 

I felt like it was nature, or God, or heaven, or something like that. This cycle of being lifted up, then dropping down, continued in waves for what must have been an hour or more. During this time, in one of the ""jungle"" phases, I witness a large mushroom being torn open at the stem, and inside was a Saurian-like being who had hidden carefully in the torn stem of the mushroom. Although he looked scary, and hissed as he was seen amongst the flesh, I was not scared of him. He had a human-like head with yellow and red snake eyes and blended so well into the mushroom as a hiding place. 

After this brief descent into the lower earthly realms, came the the most dramatic ascent yet. I was being sucked up into the void again, this time with great speed. I held my breath and heard a whooshing sound, as I was slingshot into the sky. 

The ferns parted quickly with a rustling sound and I saw the space of blackness, filled with kaleidoscopic eyes. Although there were many eyes, they were all one being. I had a euphoric rush go through my chest, which was like an orgasm of the mind. For a second I felt like I had met the 'thing' that was responsible for the mushroom, but I will refrain from naming it because I don't know what it was. I really don't know. 

After this final rush upward, I was dropped down again, back into the Earth bound jungle canopy. My concentration had broken for the last time and I felt like whatever 'IT' was, had given me my last chance. I heard a voice as this happened, it was comforting me. It wasn't speaking in words though, it was speaking directly to my mind with feelings. 

If I could translate, it would have said something like ""It's okay, you aren't ready for us, you have things to deal with on Earth in nature, with your own life. Concentrate on them, slowly and carefully and you'll get here eventually"", and so on. I was disappointed at first, but ultimately it made me realise that my priorities needed re-evaluation. Whatever this thing was, it was friendly and loving and warm and did not judge me for failing to meet it fully. 

After this, the visionary element ended and the trip ceased noticeably in strength. This was about 2-2.5 hours after ingestion. In hindsight, I think the infusion method had killed some of the potency of the shrooms, so in future I will eat them fresh. The tea, however, was rather more pleasant to drink than chewing on shrooms, and the nausea was dramatically reduced. 

The realisation: 
For the last few years I've always wanted more, and have been forgetting to enjoy what I have. So I guess this is the reminder I received. I'm always thinking I should get back in a band again, or I should dedicate my life to surfing etc. But I really don't know what I want. I feel anxiety quite a lot. It pulls me around. Telling me I should be doing something else. But the irony is, I don't know what that ""something else"" is; just like the sky-dwelling entity during my trip. 

Quite often this frustration causes me to be short tempered and irritable. But this night, I came to the conclusion that If I learn to WANT what I have, then I'll GET what I want! Sounds confusing, but it makes perfect sense to me. So my first attempt at merging with ""cosmic consciousness"" at my own sacrifice, was ultimately thwarted by myself. But it's not a bad thing, I just need to listen to it and put it into practice. Note: I had tried the ""trip in silent darkness"" approach as recommended by the late genius Terence McKenna, as a way of experiencing the mushroom without outside interference from sight, sound, and friends etc. 

In summary, this trip was as different and variable as any other trip I've ever had. Even though I've had over 30 of them, and they continue to present similar ideas, each trip does so in a completely new and novel way. It's also strange how it presents these ideas. You think you're going down one path, then it completely switches, but in the end teaches you the same lesson you initially were heading towards. It just takes the long way, and does a big loop, and shows you that the negative can truly be transformed into the positive. 

For the rest of the trip I just lay there in my room on my bed listening to music. I felt filled with warmth, peace, and a sense that everything would work out in the end. I felt so innocent and untainted by the world and it's bullshit, like a child surrounded by goodness. This was peace in a nutshell, or in this case...a mushroom""

My 1st trip to Japan was 2018. 

I am here again in 2024. 

Am I crazy, or were some things different back then?

- 7-Eleven, Lawson, and Family Mart used to sell sushi 🍱 trays, did they not?  I’ve peeked into several of these stores, and now all I can find are sushi-adjacent foods (such as a clump of rice with something stuffed inside, and it doesn’t look like traditional sushi). Did covid somehow destroy this market?
- There used to be coca-cola with coffee sold in any store, was there not?  I am not finding them anymore. Are they discontinued?
- There is a lot more English-friendliness I think. Would you concur?  It helps me out, but saddens me as a general trend, because this may reduce the stark differences in culture between East and West.  Imagine if this trend continues for another 30 years, then Japan might be like London. 
- Tourists are more filthy. I was at Shibuya crossing, where there are loads of tourists loitering. They leave garbage everywhere. I don’t remember this filthiness in 2018. Is this a new trend?",0,1731907339.0,JapanTravelTips,11,0.33,False

Basically, I have an unrelenting inner critic and without sounding overly hyperbolic, it really feels like it’s killing me. What’s more, in recent months I’ve been increasingly bitter and angry, things I’ve never wanted to be as they remind me of my father and my main trauma response is fawning so if I’m not groveling, I’m “a terrible, shitty, human being who’s not worthy of life.”

I’m in my 30s and I’ve barely done shit with my life. And now that I’ve been trying to do more, I’m around more people but it becomes more painful because it feels like at every turn there’s another sign of my failings. This week I had an interaction with my neighbor that triggered some, what I now think was, paranoia which is a lovely new symptom for me. I briefly spent the day in the hospital, after 7 years of not having been inpatient, after that. 

Then this weekend I had coffee with someone I’m trying to make friends with. I felt so stupid since I didn’t know anything he talked about cuz I didn’t go to college and I never do social things. And today I saw a show, with my mom 😑, where I felt like an idiot for not having a better understanding on the subject since it was a very political topic.

Idk, anyway, all that’s to say, I’m getting increasingly exhausted by my inner critic and by the fact that I’m not going to be able to make up for lost time. Even if I do “get better” I will never be able to get smarter or more social, or essentially gain the experience needed to be on par with my peers. Therefore leaving me alone for whatever amount of time I have left, looking like the sad pitiful loser/black sheep of the family who did this to myself because I was too lazy and stupid. I honestly don’t think I have much left in me for that. 

As much as I hate the “let the intrusive thoughts win” shit from awhile back, this time I might just let mine win in the not so distant future. I’m not sure about others but I tend to always have an exit plan which maybe doesn’t help but yeah idk",1,1731907161.0,CPTSD,2,1.0,False

1gtxg4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1gtxg4o/the_hateful_eight/,The Hateful Eight,"Just watched ""The Hateful Eight"". What a gorgeous, ""a movie like they did it them in the 1970s"" masterpiece. Tarantino even managed to get Ennio Morricone to write the score which makes the movie iconic just because of that.

The plot is rather believable, the set, the costumes, the dialogue and acting are superb.

But.... I have a simple question (spoiler alert!). Wasn't poisoning coffee pot  too risky and turned out to be gangsters' fatal mistake. Instead of waiting for John Ruth to fall asleep, or I dunno, go to to  the outhouse. This poisoned coffee led to the failure of the whole scheme that the gang had conceived. Were they presumably spooked by extra company of Warren and Mannix and the coach driver. But given unpredictability of poison action the more people were involved the more likely it was to fail (all 4 people should take coffee at about the same time, and then poison acts at different speed for different people, plus depends on how fast they drink their coffee etc). OTOH, one may argue, the gansters should have started shooting using their planted pistols as soon as commotion caused by poisoning ensued.  What I am saying that this bit seemed a little contrived. But then, you can say that, as humans, they just made mistakes.

As for Ruth and Warren.... Warren should have called Ruth outside under some pretext and told him about his suspicions from the outset instead of getting sucked into proceedings.",12,1731906918.0,movies,10,0.73,False

thank you <3 (hopefully this formats right! i'm pretty new to posting on reddit. long ass post though, sorry in advance!)

perfumes i know i like:

(sorry for non-indie ones! like i said, i'm trying to get into more indie houses!)

**b&bw's** ""kaleidoscope"" fragrance mist - my all time fav! idk what it is but it's just so good... smells ""cold"" to me??? i usually wear it in winter bc of that. oddly nostalgic? saw ppl saying it smells like swedish fish? doesn't to my nose! i can kinda get the pencil shavings comparison tbh? it's nice though (maybe it's the artist in me haha) 

**b&bw's** ""butterfly"" fragrance mist - smells similar to kaleidoscope to my nose but not exactly the same? similar in terms of how nostalgic it seems?, but it isn't ""cold"" like kaleidoscope is.

**ellis brooklyn's** ""sweet"" - recently acquired a sample of this! big fan, prob gonna FS eventually!

**nest's** ""indigo"" - bought the eau de parfum discovery set just to try this one out, really enjoy it! i saw lots of reviews saying it smells jammy and too sweet but on my skin it doesn't (thankfully. some scents get sickeningly sweet on me and i get headaches from them 😭)

**firebird's** ""black tea and mint"" - bought this as gift, bottle leaked a bit and got on my fingers but i didn't have any complaints bc it's a very nice perfume! i think it's very well blended, not too overpowering, didn't dry down weird either.

**b&bw's** ""brown sugar and fig"" + ""autumn drive"" - idk what to say about these besides i like them lmao

  
don't have the perfume but **b&bw's** ""into the night"" body lotion - smells pretty good on me but even better if my skin is wet??? don't know how that works but it smells totally different and i'm all for it.

general scents i like for further info:

uhh i like scents that smell cold??? a friend recommend i try **marc-antoine barrois'** ""ganymede"", so far kaleidoscope is the only scent i've come across that gives cold to me, hopefully i can find more!. love the smell of lily of the valley flowers (though i don't want to smell like someone's grandma, and white florals i feel are very hit or miss?). love the smell of earl grey tea, and black teas in general. whatever nature's wick ""weathered woods"" candle is, smells very comforting. i like the scent of mrs meyer's basil soap. like the smell of cranberries. lilacs. looking for a realistic blood note as well. i think i like the smell of nag champa incense?

\---

would like *but*!:

**alkemia's** ""of bronze and blaze"" - got this as a free sample, i really like it (more than the samples i chose tbh) but it ends up being cloyingly sweet on my skin, which is really sad 😭 wondering if wearing it in a perfume locket might be better for me. ""enigma"" has a similar issue, i like it but it's headache inducing </3 (smells similar to **b&bw's** ""wicked vanilla woods"" on me, both give me headaches.)

**alkemia's** 'novella"" - i really really like the smell of earl grey tea so i was hoping i'd like this but it doesn't really smell like earl grey to me, i can pick out both black tea and bergamot but to my nose they aren't blended as well as i hoped... the hunt continues i guess! (bought a solid perfume tin of **ForStrangeWomen's** ""london fog"" as a gift to my partner and snuck a lil sniff before packing it and it smelled pretty accurate from what i remember but i didn't have the chance to try it on my skin ~~yet~~ so who knows.)

**toskovat'**'s ""inexcusable evil"" - odd choice probably HAHA, picked up a sample out of curiosity, ended up liking it BUT the gunpowder note is very strong on me and oddly enough makes me smell a bit like... smoked chicken? which unfortunately is the breaking point for me (mayhaps i'm just not a fan of gunpowder notes? i have a sample of **alkemia's** ""industrial sabotage"" and the smoke is so strong it gave me a panic attack LMAO) like this perfume besides that, wish the blood note was stronger on me though! heard **BPAL's** ""congealed blood and oozing viscera"" is probably more what i'm looking for? but seems i'm a bit too late for checking it out </3

  
\---

not a fan:

**b&bw's** ""dark kiss"" fragrance mist - smells very heavy and Bad on me, smells nice on my partner though!

**nest's** ""sunkissed hibiscus"" - smells like another fragrance i've got from **b&bw**, can't remember if it's 'pure wonder"" or ""sweater weather"", either way it ended up being too strong on me i think. all 3 of these i really have to be in the mood for tbh ;w;

i used to like apple scents a lot but i have an apple air freshener i've been using in the bathroom so now i just associate it with Doing Business LMAO. damn shame.

not sure what other notes i'm not a big fan due to me not knowing what is *what* exactly :( uhh i know teakwood (candles at least) are occasionally a bit overwhelming to me. don't like chocolate scents, might not like coffee scents due to body chemistry but i am willing to try! i'm just assuming they don't work well on my skin. hate the smell of orange peels?

had issues with a lot of the **alkemia** samples i bought, but i feel like they may still need some resting. a lot of them were nausea-inducing and/or soapy smelling to me. will retry though!

\---

  
perfumes that seem intriguing to me: **DeathAndFloral's**: ""black cherry bomb"", ""bones melting together"", ""doomsday"", ""electric feel"", ""girls and graves"", ""if we make it through december"", ""lucid dreams"", ""sleep that rhymes with death"", ""the people you love become ghosts inside you' (really interested in this one). **TheStrangeSouth's**: ""twice dead"", ""cafe"", ""blood on the moon"", ""don't fear the reaper', ""poor dove"". **alkemia's**: ""writer's blood""?

  
\---

list of other samples i've got and date acquired for reference (some aren't *mine* so idk how they smell on my skin... yet), need to try again:

**alkemia**: *lilacs along the winding drive, falling stars on winter solstice, evening song, dryad, whisper of the stars, the highwayman, dustsceawung, béguin (free sample)*. (all acquired sep 3rd)

**Tuesday:** Arrival, relax and beach day with shopping  
**Wednesday:** Shark's Cove and Sunset Beach (Sunset Beach we just want to see, and I am thinking of switching Shark's Cove for something like Kuilima Cove to have calmer waters hopefully, so we can snorkel). Stop at the Green World Coffee Farm and the Dole Pineapple Plantation (I want to see the maze!)  
**Thursday:** GoCity day, Pearl Harbor Museum and Aloha Kai Luau at Sea Life Park (I selected it over the Ka Moana Luau because it's less crowded.)  
**Friday:** GoCity day, Secret Island Beach with Kualoa Ranch, Waimea Falls, Polynesian Cultural Center  
**Saturday:** GoCity day, Iolani Palace visit, Kona Brewing, Lanikai Beach and Pillbox Trail Hike, Koolau Distillery tour  
**Sunday:** This is the day of the marathon, so we were planning on staying at the resort for the morning and then sightseeing in Honolulu, like the Bishop Museum or the open air mall  
**Monday:** Diamond Head Trail Hike, Manoa Waterfalls sightseeing, departure that night.

1gtxb1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gtxb1g/when_i_spoke_it_wasnt_me/,"When I Spoke, it wasn’t Me. ","When I was 18 and my sister was 5, I was babysitting in the basement of our family’s house while my mom was in the shower and my stepdad was asleep.

It was my mom’s birthday, so she took one of those long, indulgent showers, and I knew she’d be in there for a while. I set out some toys for my sister and turned on the TV. The faint sound of water running was the only noise in the house, aside from the television.

Our basement is set up so that the sofa is right against the wall next to the stair landing. When you’re sitting on it, if you turn to the right, you can see straight up the stairs. In front of us was the rest of the room—TV, coffee table, the usual.

As an 18-year-old who thought it was funny to tease my younger sister, I switched the channel to a scary movie. She glanced at the screen for a moment, then proudly declared, ""Sissy, I’m not scared.""

Of course, that took the fun out of it, so I quickly turned off the TV and fiddled with my phone while my sister played with her toys on the floor. Time passed—five minutes, maybe longer—but everything suddenly seemed to still. There was a shift in the atmosphere, like the house had stood frozen. The air felt thick, the lights felt brighter.

From the top of the stairs, a voice called down to us. It was familiar, but strange. Distant, almost as if it were coming from another place or another period that wasn’t my own.

It was far away, but at the same time, so eerily close—it was right at the top of those stairs.

My mom was still in the shower, and my stepdad was asleep. This voice, though, was not his, even if he had been awake. It didn't belong to anyone in the house. But it was there, undeniable.

It was a girls voice. A cold, calm voice.
I froze, my blood turning to ice. I didn’t want to look up those stairs. I knew someone was standing there, and I knew that if I turned my head, I would see them—whatever they were.

I glanced at my sister. Her wide, tear-filled eyes were locked on me. She wasn’t moving.

I tried to stay calm, not wanting to scare her more than she already was. ""What’s wrong, baby?"" I whispered.
She barely spoke, as if she didn’t want whoever—or whatever—was at the top of the stairs to hear her. ""Who was that?"" she whispered back, her voice barely audible.

At that moment, I knew she’d heard it too. And I wasn’t going crazy.

""Who was what?"" I asked, forcing myself to stay steady, though my stomach churned and my ears pounded with the sound of my own heartbeat.

She stared at me with those big, wide eyes. ""Who said that?""

My mind was racing, but I asked anyway, ""What did the voice say?""

And then, with a small, trembling voice, she repeated it: ""Hey, Kayleigh?""

That was my name. My name. She had confirmed my fears in those two words, as she focused on my face, awaiting an answer that might ease her discomfort.
There was no emotion in the voice, no warmth, no recognition. Just the flatness of a question—a question for me.

My blood turned to ice. I couldn’t look at the stairs. My body locked in place as I reached for my sister. She bolted into my lap, trembling.

We sat there, staring straight ahead, not daring to move. We waited, for what felt like forever, until the sound of the shower finally stopped. My mom’s footsteps echoed down the hall. I could barely breathe; my chest was heavy.

I hurried upstairs, holding my sister tightly, keeping my eyes narrowed towards the ground. I asked my mom if she had called me, but she said no. There was no way it could have been her—Of course it wasn’t her.
That’s when it hit me. The voice, the one that had called my name—it sounded too familiar. It sounded like me.
And that was just the beginning.

Over the years, I started hearing it more often—my own voice. My mom would call me, frantic, telling me she’d heard me in the halls of our home, calling for her. But the words I’d spoken were strange—childish, almost—things like, ""Mommy, help me,"" or ""I need you."" I hadn’t called her ""Mommy"" since I was a child.

And it wasn’t just confined to the walls of my mother’s home. I’d catch it in my house too. Once, I heard myself say, ""Bless you,"" after I sneezed. I would hear it whistling sometimes, or humming tunes I didn’t recognize. A low, almost mocking hum. It felt like something was trying to get my attention, only to slip away when I tried to focus on it.

At first, I only noticed small, unsettling signs that something was happening to me. I’d walk into rooms I could have sworn I’d already been in—catching a glimpse of myself standing motionless in a corner or sitting unnaturally still in a chair, eyes fixed in a blank stare. At times, when I looked into the mirror, my reflection wouldn’t move in sync with me—its eyes would linger a fraction too long, and the corners of its mouth would twitch as though it was forcing back a smile. My clothes would be dirtied and worn, even though I’d never touched them, and strange stains I didn’t recognize would appear on my hands. Then, my favorite foods—those things I would savor slowly—started to disappear faster than I could eat them. I’d turn my back for just a moment, and when I looked again, entire plates of food were gone, as if someone else was feeding on them.

I started finding things—objects I didn’t recognize, sitting in the corner of my room, in my closet, under my bed. Little trinkets. Childish toys. Their presence made no sense. I would wake up to find that I had drawn pictures in my sleep—abstract, disturbing images of eyes, mouths, strange shapes I couldn’t decipher. But when I tried to remember doing it, my mind was blank. I couldn’t explain it. I didn’t feel like I was in control. 

I’ve felt it—whatever it is—slithering under my skin, like a dark presence crawling through my veins, pulling at my muscles, trying to take control.

And I couldn’t stop it.

I started to withdraw from friends and family. Conversations with them began to feel hollow, as if I wasn’t really present—like I was always a step behind, always trying to catch up to what they were saying. At night, I would wake to hear my name whispered from the dark corner of my room, but when I checked, nothing was there. I knew what I was hearing. It was me. That mocking, childish voice would speak from the shadows, like it was taking pleasure in my fear.

The worst part is, I’m starting to lose track of time. I’ll wake up hours, maybe days later, in places I don’t remember being. And there’s that voice again, calling my name from somewhere I can’t reach, or sometimes laughing softly, as if amused by my confusion. Every night, it gets harder to tell where I end and the thing pretending to be me begins. 

At times, I wondered if I had completely lost my mind.
It was becoming harder to distinguish where I ended and where it began.

I can’t escape it.

I can’t escape the sound of my own voice, echoing back at me from some place I can’t reach. 

Something—someone—has taken it, and I’m afraid it’s never going to let go.

And now, I’m not sure I’ll ever be me again. I’ve stopped looking in mirrors because I’m terrified of what I’ll see. The reflection no longer matches the person I used to be—my face is wrong, my eyes are too wide, my smile too sharp, as if it’s someone else wearing my skin. Sometimes, when I’m alone, I hear my voice calling to me from other rooms, or see myself standing in a doorway, watching me with that same eerie, unsettling stillness.

I thought I could fight it. I tried to scream, to make the voice stop, but all I could do was watch helplessly as it twisted my sense of being, shaping my former self into something alien. I’ve tried to tell people, to ask for help, but no one believes me. They think it’s stress, or maybe I’m just imagining things. But I know better. I can feel it burrowing into me. And it’s not stopping.

I’m not sure if this is the last time I’ll try to ask for help—or if it’s just another desperate moment in a never-ending loop of this… whatever this is. But I know one thing for certain: I’ve become a stranger in my own body. And soon, I won’t even recognize myself anymore.
Maybe I’ll just disappear altogether. Maybe it’s already too late.

Even now, as my fingers tremble over the keys, I can almost feel the cold pressure of another hand on mine, guiding each letter with deliberate precision—I can hear my own voice in low whispers, forcing me to finish the sentence I was too terrified to write: When I spoke, it wasn’t me.

This isn't meant to be a review, but I'll just write my thoughts, for posterity. The 2 cup moka pot, gets filled by about 9-11 grams coffee, and brews about 100ml of coffee. The brew is decent, if not nice actually. And it *is* convenient to use. 

HOWEVER. Cleaning it immediately is a pain in the ass, the Moka Pot is way too hot to just clean up instantly, and cleaning the nozzle is not a simple job. This is not made for a clean workflow. And got me thinking how simple the aeropress is, just use, clean, and put back. 

Also, fines tend to creep into the moka pot, how much ever I try changing the grind size. not enough to really bother me, but enough to be noticeable. Something the Aeropress manages to overcome with the right grind size. Hopefully there are some filter papers I can use, that can remove even the smallest fines in the Moka Pot.

With that out of the way, I'm just gonna end my rant with a question. 

If you could have only one, which one would it be ? Moka Pot or the Aeropress ?",5,1731906285.0,IndiaCoffee,13,1.0,False

That isn't rhetorical or snarky, I'm just curious. Have you just gotten too used to the taste of caramel to notice that it's there, or do you mean that you can still taste coffee? 12 pumps is the most that you can order through the app, and I have had customers come to me and tell me that those full 12 pumps (and extra drizzle) leave the drink lacking flavor. Do you ever find yourselves getting ""numb"" to the flavor and needing to add more? Because I would like to know if that's what's going on here, or if customers just prefer to be drinking straight caramel.

And to fellow baristas, is this a universal experience? The store I work at gets dozens upon dozens of customers come through with very little patience, distraught that there's ""no caramel"" in their drink that certainly does, including visible drizzle. Sometimes it feels like the cup and the whip/top of the drink both need to be completely coated just for the customer to be satisfied.

I'm [27F] having troubles answering people's questions about my pregnancy, caused some drama with friends (all 20s)

I'm 7 months pregnant with a child I plan on giving to a wonderful couple, closed adoption. I made this choice because the child was the product of non-consensual sex. I didn't press charges because I was a bit of a party-girl and didn't think I would be believed. I honestly have no idea who the guy was, I just remember trying to push him off and being to drunk to do so.

MY choice to not press charges. MY choice to keep the pregnancy. MY choice to adopt out. I am comfortable with these choices. They are private and personal and I am keeping most of this to myself.

My asshole friends and co-workers have turned it into a game. I was hiding the pregnancy until I started really showing a couple weeks ago. I get that people are curious about it. It's rather surprising. But I saw a betting pool being passed around the office...THEY ARE PLACING BETS ON WHO IS THE FATHER! I was shocked and a little hurt.

My friends are also curious. I have one close friend who basically knows everything (she's going to be in the room for the birth for me) and she's not telling anyone. So, rumors are starting. One terrible rumor is that it's my (now former) friend Karen's husband Troy's baby. Karen called me in tears. I went over to her house to tell her to her face it wasn't it possible. She demanded to know the truth. I told her it was none of her business and she blasted me on fb.

Some friends have been really nice to my face but everything gets back to me eventually. Some people are saying that I'm a paid surrogate. I guess that one is ok. I hate that people are talking about me like this. I made ONE blanket statement on fb yesterday: ""I guess I can't hide it anymore. Yes, I am pregnant. I am giving a lovely couple the child they have tried to have for years. It's very personal and private and I ask that you all respect that."" It's got a bunch of comments but I haven't read them. I'm going to take a big break from social media.

I don't know what else to do or say. I am uncomfortable with everyone's constant questions. I LOVE my job and usually my co-workers. It's my hope that I can suck it up and go back to normal in a few months. Weirdly, I've got great inner-peace with everything because I am so happy to be giving the adopting parents (who are the kindest men I have ever met: a kindergarten teacher and a social worker) something they could never have on their own.

Here's what I need from the readers of this sub: What can I say that isn't a lie but will shut people up without giving out information I'm not comfortable sharing? I don't like calling her (the baby is female) an 'accident'. The two people who know the whole truth (my friend and my doctor) immediately asked me why I didn't report it. I'm ashamed and humiliated. I really don't want to say much of anything. I think a big part of why this is so hard for me and those around me is that I'm usually really talkative and social. Loud-mouthed. I'm in sales so now that I'm showing I'm also dealing with these questions from strangers too. Should I go to my manager about the pool? Laugh it off? Wait for it all to blow over?

tl;dr: I need to figure out what to tell people about my unplanned pregnancy in a polite but firm way that will make them stop speculating

UPDATE #1 (OOP updated in the same post on same day, four hours later)

Thank you so much for all the support. I'm glad I posted this.

I had a good cry, took an antacid (or 4) and went to the owner, Jim. I told him the truth and I told him that I really didn't want the guys to know and I needed the jokes and talk to stop because it was hurting me. He hugged me and told me he was proud of me (which made me cry again. Fucking hormones). He gathered the staff and had a quick (what he calls come to Jesus) meeting. He announced that he would fire anyone who made me uncomfortable about my pregnancy on the spot and that all the money from the pool needed to end up on my desk, pronto. He was great. He didn't share any of my personal info, he just protected me and made it quick and easy. After we disbursed, he told me I could have an additional week paid medical (I already have 2 weeks sick/vacation I haven't used).

I am going to text/talk to my friend and tell her she can subtly let people know what happened (especially Karen).

This baby bump is sales gold, I just landed a BIG commission while sitting!

I still think, as great as Jim is, I need to get out of this town. I'll always be a trailer park slut to people around here. My mama died when I was real young and I acted out a lot after that. Everyone knows what I did and won't let me forget. Despite working my ass off to graduate, working my way up to sales lead, buying my home and fixing it up myself. I'm sick of Oklahoma. I'm thinking maybe somewhere in Oregon or Washington. Real pretty up there.

Again, thank you for all the kind and helpful advice. I feel so much better. This has always been one of my favorite subs to lurk. Thanks.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Your friends and colleagues are assholes. Tell people simply that you are not sharing details. Keep it simple. Sounds like you do have one decent caring friend. After this was over I would consider launching a fresh start. Given the circumstances of the pregnancy and how everybody is reacting at least get some counselling to deal with this and maybe plot out some goals and desires fo the kind of life you really want. Sorry you have had such a bad experience.

> **OOP:** I am thinking about a new start, actually. I love my field (building material sales) and can do it anywhere. I don't have any family. My house would sell for double what I owe. I've been researching towns that I've always liked.
> 
> My doctor gave me a referral for a therapist, but I wasn't interested. Maybe I should give it a go. Thanks.

**OOP on why she chose not to reveal anything to her friends about her unplanned pregnancy**

> **OOP:** I really don't want people knowing what happened to me. Like I said in my post, the first reaction was why didn't you report it? I hate that I didn't. I hate that some dude is out there, thinking he can do that. I hate that I used to drink so much. I hate that because I used to drink a lot and hook up a lot that people think so little of me.
> 
> I just don't want everyone to know. I don't want this little girl to ever find that out.

**Did OOP report the situation to HR?**

> **OOP:** We're a smallish outfit. We don't have an HR. We have an owner-manager (who I really respect and is kind of like a second father to me). We're 7 guys and me. I've always been 'one of the guys' about this kind of stuff.
> 
> I should go to the owner and tell him what's up. I've been avoiding him. I've been avoiding everyone. I don't want to be pitied, but this shit it worse. I'm all over the place sorry. I'm shut in my office with the worst heartburn I have ever felt trying not to cry.

**OOP should consider about leaving her job**

> **OOP:** I still have to work with these guys for another couple months, 40-50 hours a week. Maybe longer, I'm still deciding. They just got their pee-pees smacked by work-daddy for being insensitive in a place where we regularly tease each other for everything. They did something stupid, but I still want to get along with them.

[Update #2 (rareddit)](https://rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5zzeu3/update_im_27f_having_troubles_answering_peoples/): **March 17, 2017** 

First, I'd like to thank the kind, understanding folk in this sub for your help when I posted this a few months ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52rgdx/im_27f_having_troubles_answering_peoples/

I had a few PMs asking for updates and how everything went. It's been a wild ride. I posting this from a freezing (but spectacular) beachside hotel on the coast of Oregon. I had a job interview this morning that I feel really great about and two more lined up. My house sold fast and I have some money to live on and start fresh.

And do I ever need a fresh start.

A few days after I made that post, rumors started up again. I was pregnant with my boss's baby (some of you called that). And then it was a co-worker's. And then my friend's husband again. To save face, I asked my friend to tell the right blabber-mouths the truth. That back-fired. Hard.

Someone (or some people, I don't know) started posting on CRAIGSLIST about me and the baby. There's this section called Rants and Raves but I guess people just post garbage there. I looked at some of the posts and someone really has it out for me. They said I was crying rape because I was too slutty to know who the father was. They called me the worst names. I flagged what I could, but new posts kept popping up. I tried to ignore it.

I had a good friend write me this long-ass text about how I was making it all worse with my 'rape story'. I was devastated. I guess my prior life and reputation are all people there will ever think of me.

I kept my head down and just tried to forget it all. It was effecting my work. I put my house up for sale and made a plan to GTFO.

I was at 38 weeks and had resigned my position (my wonderful boss told me I could come back, but I don't want to). I was selling most of my belongings and packing what mattered to me. There's a knock on my door, real late. Later than folks should be knocking. It was a man I kinda know from the bar scene. He was drunk and angry. He told me it was maybe his baby and I had no right to call it rape. I remember talking to him that night, but I really don't remember it being him. But I don't remember anything other than pushing him off and wishing I was stronger. I told him to go home and to leave me alone.

I'm trying to brief, but he made the next week hell for me. He was harassing me at my house every day and calling at all hours. He was threatening me and demanding a paternity test. I was terrified that he was going to mess up the adoption. I was growing more and more scared for my safety too. I couldn't sleep or eat. My friend came over and we called the police and told them everything. The officer who came to my house was great. I don't know what they said to him, but it worked and he left me alone. I went into labor the next week.

I ended up getting c-section because the baby had turned and was breech. One of her fathers ended up holding my hand (my friend was there but only one was allowed in the room). He got to cut the cord. The baby was perfectly healthy and beautiful. She had this thick, dark hair the chubbiest cheeks. Her fathers were instantly and madly in love. They took her home the next day. I had to stay awhile because of the surgery. It was the hardest three days of my life. The hospital sent a therapist in and she was helpful. When I was released I spent a few days in a luxury hotel with my dear friend. I never went home. I paid someone to pack my stuff for me. I spent the next two months at my grandmother's house in Texas, recovering and thinking and waiting the cash from the sale of my house. I was terrified I would get a call that the man from the bar had somehow fucked up the adoption, but it hasn't come and I grew less worried. I honestly don't care who the father is. I just want the baby to have a good life. I continued to see another therpist. When I felt well enough, we packed my rig and I took off. There was a vague plan of head west and find it. I went to the Grand Canyon. I saw the Great White Sands. I spent an entire freezing day staring at the ocean in Santa Monica. I did the trip cheap, mostly sleeping my car and cheap hotels. I spent time in every place that I found beauty.

I landed here, at the prettiest place I've ever seen. I got a good rate at a motel and got an Oregon driver's liscence. I thought about changing my name too, but I don't want to change who I am. Just the where.

Wow, this ended up being a novel. Thanks again.

tl;dr: I put up with more awfulness and had the baby. She is with her family and loved. I got the fuck outta Dodge. I'm happy. Well, I'm working on happy. I feel free.

**Relevant Comments**

**OOP moving out of town, start fresh, make new social media accounts** 

> **OOP:** Excellent advice. I used to love facebook. I have cousins and such that I can only really contact through it. But I disabled my acct during the craigslist nonsense and I don't miss it. I got a new phone number too and only gave it to a few people I want to hear from. I was a little worried about no social media presence and getting a new job, but I'll cross that bridge if it comes up. I have a glowing recommendation from my old job and a proven record of success. That should be enough.

+

> Everyone here has been sooooo nice. Not Oklahoma nice, that's just nosey-nice. People here are chill and kind-hearted. The manager of the hotel I'm calling home at the moment? She just gives rooms to the homeless when it's cold. Doesn't make a big deal about it, either. And the kids at the coffee shop I like are all real artsy and funny. I haven't met a mean or snarky person yet. I know I'm new but it already feels like home in a way.

Here are some examples:

- puts hot coffee in a glass and then puts it in the freezer to cool it down. Obviously it shattered in his hand and I had to take him to the emergency room

- gets off the escalator and just stands there without moving i have to yell at him to get out because there are people behind him

- microwaved raw chicken

-backseat driving that can get extremely dangerous. I would he driving and would arrive at an unprotected left turn and he would just say go its safe when it clearly isnt. 

All these times I’ve had to yell at him to stop doing things and to think about how hes being a danger to other people. 

I get it the guy probably has some minor level of learning or behavioral disabilities growing up but he gets mad at me everytime I have to raise my voice at him for endangering himself or other people because he really doesnt understand safety and thinks I can always be a lot nicer. But when you decide to just block the exit of an escalator or be a poor backseat driver, other people get hurt or can get injured.

What Id like to know is if there is a better form of communication out there that I can try for in the moment, urgent actions to make someone stop an action or to do an immediate action or am I stuck yelling at him and hurting his feelings?

The worst part is the dreams I have of them  The best thing I can do is be patient with myself and show compassion. I realize that's not that I miss them. I miss that version of them. I miss being able to be open and comfortable with someone to the point I don't have to hide anything. I miss how they would listen and just be there when I needed them too. Im trying to just feel the feelings. Just allow myself to miss this person who meant so much to me. Just breathe and listen to there favorite music and think about how I could be the kind of friend they where for me for my other friends. I've tried coming at it logically. I've tried ignoring it. I've tried replacing them or the idea of them. But nothing is going to replace them. The kid who saved my life in the fifth grade just by saying a few simple words I would miss you. Or the teenage who dragged me to a star bucks coffee shop and how adorable she looked shoving a cookie in there mouth. The person I danced with in front of my house because we both missed prom and I just wanted to have one moment. I was so nervous about that for some reason. So many good moments. I guess growing up is letting them go and knowing when to enjoy the next moment be present with our friends and try not to take them for granted. It's funny how I'm thinking about missing this person and at the same time I'm thinking about how happy I am to have my girlfriend. Thinking about all the moments I had with them as well.

   I work in residential youth care, specifically in a group exclusively for refugees. Ten boys from Afghanistan, Syria, Pakistan, Somalia, and other countries—you get the idea.

   For clarification, this took place in August.

   It’s Sunday evening. I’m studying my work schedule... ah, okay:

    Tuesday: 9:45 AM - 8:30 PM
    Thursday: 9:45 AM - 8:30 PM
    Friday: 9:45 AM - 8:30 PM
    Saturday: 9:45 AM - 8:30 PM

   Four 10-hour shifts—a full 40-hour week. Wow, those still exist, I am so used to have to work more than 40 hours. I should not have been so excited about this...

   Ten-hour shifts are exhausting but manageable. After all, it’s summer vacation. Some of the kids are visiting family, and others are out and about anyway.

   Tuesday Morning: 9:45 AM

   “You’re going hiking today!” my night-shift colleague greets me as I arrive.

   “Hiking?”

   “Yes, hiking!”

   I grimace. Not because I don’t like hiking, but at 32°C (90°F) and wearing inappropriate clothes, I’m definitely not in the mood. No hiking boots, no backpack, and a nice pair of white pants that’ll show every drop of ass sweat—just perfect.

   Couldn’t they have told me earlier? I could’ve at least brought spare clothes. Now I’ll spend the evening in the office drenched in sweat. Wonderful.

   But whatever, we’re going hiking. It’s not like it’s a long trek, and at least some of the kids (two of them, at least) are excited.

   We leave around 2 PM, hike, everything goes smoothly. We’re back at the facility around 6 PM. Everyone is happy and tired. Then someone slams the car door shut, and another one screams.

   And just like that, two people learned that thumbs and car doors don’t mix well.

   Off to the ER we go. I inform a colleague in another group because, as is common in social work, one person has to watch over everyone else while the other handles emergencies. Great system, right?

   Luckily, we only have to wait two hours this time (a rarity at our ER). It turns out to be nothing serious—just swollen and bruised. They wrap it up, and we’re advised to see a general practitioner later in the week for a follow-up.

   By now, it’s 9 PM. The last bus in my city runs at 8:30 PM. Fantastic... time for a 45-minute walk home.

   Thursday Morning: 9:45 AM

   Handover Notes:

    Take the kid with the injured thumb to the doctor at 10:30 AM.
    Accompany another kid to his doctor appointment at 2 PM.

   Alright, seems manageable. Plus, there’s the usual household tasks, but that’s nothing major.

   11:00 AM
   The kid comes back from the doctor. “Nobody was there,” he says.

   Hmm, okay. “Alright, the doctor opens again at 4 PM. I’ll take you then, and we’ll check again.”

   11:30 AM
   I’m preparing lunch, only to realize half the kids left without notifying anyone.

   12:10 PM
The doctor’s office calls. “Where’s the kid?”

   Confused, I reply, “Wasn’t the appointment at 2 PM?”

   “No, it’s now,” they snap back.

   “Huh, okay. If I leave now, can we still make it?”

   “It’s a discharge appointment, so it should work. But please be punctual next time!”

   I roll my eyes.

   I knock on the kid’s door. He’s still sleeping. I wake him up, tell him to get dressed, and do all of this as quickly as possible.

   “Huh? Why?”

   “You have your doctor’s appointment now.”

   “NOOO! It’s at 2 PM!”

   “No, they just called—it’s now!”

   12:30 PM
   We’re at the doctor’s office. They call us in.

   “Yes, Mr. Müller (name changed), everything looks good. You’re healthy again!”

   AND I HAD TO BE THERE FOR THIS??? THE KID SPEAKS ENOUGH GERMAN FOR THIS!!!

   1:00 PM
   We’re back at the facility.

   2:00 PM
   I’m playing UNO with a few of the kids in the living room.

The phone rings. A legal guardian informs me that one of our kids has a to go to the police... today... at 4 PM. Oh, and I can’t handle it, so it’s up to you guys. Thanks, bye!

   He is supposed to testify as a witness regarding his smuggling into Germany.

   Great. Remember that 4 PM doctor appointment for the thumb? Right, me too.

   I tell the thumb kid, “5 PM instead.”

   3:55 PM
   I grab the summoned kid, his ID, and the paperwork, then head to the police station.

   Of course, I inform a colleague downstairs that no one will be in the refugee group for a while. It should only take 45 minutes. No big deal, right?

   4:00 PM
   We’re at the police station, waiting for the interpreter.

   4:05 PM
   The interpreter calls. He’s in the wrong city.

   Apparently, he misread the address:

    Police City A, Precinct City B, Right Address 69, 12345 City B

   Now he’s driving to us, which will take about 20 minutes.

   At least there’s a fire in the building next door, so we have something to watch...

   5:15 PM
The interpreter arrives, he got in a traffic jam. He speaks Farsi. Our kid speaks Pashto.

   The session is canceled due to the language barrier. Rescheduled for tomorrow at 11:15 AM.

   5:25 PM
   We return to the facility. The thumb kid is standing there, visibly annoyed. Who can blame him? We were supposed to leave at 5 PM...

   Another kid shows up. “I’m hungry!”

   The colleague who hadn’t shown up all day now suddenly appears—of course.

   I explain to the kid that I’m locking the kitchen because I’m leaving.

   “No problem, I’ll clean up!”

   “No, I’m not allowed to leave the kitchen unlocked without supervision.”

   “WHAT?! I’M HUNGRY!”

   “Well, tough luck!”

   Thumb kid and I head to the doctor’s office. There are no parking spots. We park so far away we might as well have walked.

   We turn the corner to the doctor’s street and...

   “We’re on vacation from 08/14 - 09/01!”
   Couldn't they put this on their Website???

   19:30

   My colleague who has nightshift calls. She's ill. Damn, sucks, but there's nothing I can do. I tell her not to worry and to get Well soon. I call my Boss:

   ""My colleague is ill and can't cover her shift, we need replacement.""

   ""Ok, I'll have a look!""

   20:30

   My Boss calls me back. 

   ""Can you do a 24-hour shift?""

   ""No!""

   ""But I can't find anyone.""

   ""Not my problem, I'll leave at 21:30, replacement or not!""

   Remember me being happy about (theoratically) no overtime this week? Yeah, about that... 

   You can guess, I am not best buddies with my Boss but not having a replacement is not my problem, it's his.

   21:00

   He found someone, he'll be here shortly. Perfect.

   Friday Morning: 9:45 AM

   10:30 AM
   I wake up the kid to head to the police station.

   11:00 AM
   We’re getting ready to leave when another kid shows up, wanting breakfast.

   “Grab some toast, some sausage, whatever you need—but hurry, I have to lock up!”

   No, he wants beans and a cooked meal.

   “No, not happening, I have to leave!”

   He gives me an angry glare.

   Status effect: No coffee, no patience, no time.

   I take no damage.

   He retreats.

   XP gained: +15
   Status effect gained: Bad mood

   11:15 AM
   We’re back at the police station.

   11:25 AM
   The interpreter calls. His train is delayed.

   Wouldn’t it be nice if something worked for once?

   11:35 AM
   The interpreter arrives. His German is terrible. Quality work as always.

   Questions have to be repeated and rephrased multiple times to be understood.

   One question stands out:
   “How did you get from Hungary to Germany?”
   “Walked for two days, then a white bus picked us up and dropped us off near the border.”

   “Interesting, because here it says you came in a white SUV!”

   This kid was 14 years old at the time, had been fleeing for almost a year, and had lost contact with his family during the journey. Now, 1.5 years amd a lot of therapy later, you expect him to remember if it was an SUV or a minibus?

   1:00 PM
   We’re done.

   “You can find your way out?”
   “Stairs down, turn left?”
   “Exactly. Bye!”

   We head downstairs, turn left, and go through a door. It closes behind us.

   We’re in a small space with two doors: one to freedom, one back to the police.

   The problem?
   Both are locked, and there’s no buzzer.

   1:15 PM
   The postman rings the bell. Our savior... finally, we get out.

   “What are you doing here?”

   We turn around to see a policeman with his hand on his gun.

   After a brief explanation, he laughs (great) and lets us go.

   2:00 PM
   I’m back at the office, mentally drained, and the day still has six hours left.

   I hope this gave you a little “exhale-laugh-through-the-nose” moment!

I know there’s a lot to think about, like designing the perfect play area, creating a family-friendly menu, and of course, all the legal stuff like permits and licenses. But I’m not even sure exactly what permits I’d need for something like this.

If you’ve ever started a small business or know about play cafes specifically, I’d love to hear your advice! What are some things I should think about before diving in? Are there any common challenges I should prepare for?

I don’t think I’m gonna miss it, I hate it now. Since becoming a single mother and my youngest becoming a toddler (giving me Two toddlers) my patience is so thin. I feel like a bad mom not appreciating the cuteness that comes with toddlers because I’m incredibly irritated by the whining.

Sometimes I hide in the guest bathroom and cry out of frustration. Between the whining and tantrums I just can’t handle this alone. My sister in law texted me yesterday asking how my night was. I was crying under the coffee table. One kid on the tablet, one kid sympathy crying. She came and got them and I had relief for 45 mins, they came home and it started all over again. I feel like I’m drowning and when I meet other moms in public they say I’ll miss this or that THEY this time of their kids lives.

They’re at daycare all day and when they come home we eat, bathe and go to sleep. I feel like I should want to spend more time with them but more than anything I wanna run away. That makes me feel shitty. Before everything happened I loved being a mother. Now that I’m alone it feels like torture with very little positive/happy moments.

Isn’t this supposed to be magical? Aren’t we ALL supposed to be having a good time? Will things get easier with age?",7,1731905558.0,toddlers,15,0.71,False

Chapter 7: *Awful. Awful. Awful. I hate this.*

Clyde – Shipwrecked Human – Age: 23

Roughly 1 Glorbian day and 5 hours after impact.

With nothing interesting to look at other than metal walls, I watch the rhythmic back and forth of my feet as I walk. I listen to the sound of my shoes making contact with metal as I walk the corridors of The Double Quarter, waiting for the ship to return home, even with FTL it is a long journey back to Earth. Walking feels effortless but, it appears that I am moving nowhere, the hallways don’t end. Suddenly, I look up from the ground to see three Glorbians before me, which I instantly recognize as the Zecklemire family.

*Their faces are full of fear. They are afraid of me.*

Jarekk is pointing a plasma rifle right between my eyes. I open my mouth to speak but nothing happens, *I need to leave*. I try to back away, but my legs betray me, and I walk forward instead. Suddenly, I hear three loud shots as the rifle in front of me fires, but nothing happens to me. I am still standing, and their faces morph into true terror. What little safety they felt with a rifle in their hands is now gone. Panic in his eyes, Jarekk squeezes the trigger *BANG BANG BANG*, but I persist, Jarekk’s face shows only fear, but his voice speaks calmly,

“Clyde, are you awake?”

*Awake?*

Suddenly everything around me morphs into a dark gray haze as I suddenly jolted from my slumber. I heard another trio of bangs coming from the glorbian door. With the shed’s lights off it is very difficult to see anything meaningful, but the light that seeps underneath both the overhead and glorbian door allows me to gather my sense of direction. Soreness in my left arm instantly nagged at me, not enough pain to cause a ruckus, just enough to be annoying. Feeling the bandage, it felt relatively dry, *I should check on it later.* Jarekk asked again from the other side of the door,

“Are you up Clyde?”

Closing my mouth and swallowing to wet my vocal cords I replied, “I’m up. What’s going on?” I rubbed my eyes and tried desperately to fight my innate urge to curl up in this makeshift bed. A giant pile of sleeping bags and pillows had never felt so good to sleep on. I sat upright to try and prevent an accidental pass-out when Jarekk replied,

“Well, it’s about time to move those gryneer corpses, also can I come in by chance? It's twilight and I would rather be inside than not.”

Calculating the right response and ensuring I was still wearing clothes I told Jarekk to come on in. As the door opened the room was welcomed with dusk light as I watched a figure morph in through the door and quickly flip the light switch. Immediately I felt immense pain in my eyes as the glorbian’s want for vision just flashbanged me. I winced in pain as I closed my eyes, moving my hand to shield my face. The glorbian apologized,

“Oh! SORRY, Sorry, I didn’t mean to hurt you. Are you going to be alright?”

My tired brain was already incredibly irritated by Jarekk’s actions, but I knew that I had to keep calm to make a good impression, just because they allowed me to stay doesn’t mean they couldn’t revoke that at any time. I answered him,

“Yeah, I’ll be alright, just takes some time for human eyes to adjust to the light. Are we doing this right now or can I wake up a little?”

At this point, my eyes were ready to slowly open up and try to take a peek at the world around me, as my eyes were adjusting, I noticed that Jarekk was holding some stuff and wearing something. Before my vision was fully restored he answered,

“Well, I was planning on giving it a few minutes. Going at dusk would be a net loss, as glorbians would still be able to see a massive human walking around, and predators start their hunting once the sun sets.”

As Jarekk explained the plan, my eyes finally adjusted to the room and I noticed the two large metal objects he was holding, one long and one shorter and more cuboid, along with a bag slung over his shoulder. The metal cube appeared to be a fan of some kind, its purpose unknown. The long metal object appeared to be an energy rifle of some kind, but I had never seen a glorbian one in person before. It looked fairly similar to a human rifle just scaled down to fit their tiny form. This one also had a scope attached to it, probably to hunt game and predators from a safe distance. I have never used a plasma rifle before, I’ve been to a shooting range a few times with my dad, but he was a kinetics man, our family never bought into the hype.

*Maybe today is the day I learn. Assuming he didn’t bring that rifle here to kill me.*

*Ehh, he probably would have by now if that was his master plan.*

*Maybe he just wants you to move those gryneers first.*

*. . . let's hope that’s not why you are alive.*

Jarekk continued, “So you have a few minutes to wake up, probably for the best considering how long you were out.”

“How long was I asleep?”

“Around 15 hours. Didn’t really want to wake you up, but you just kept on sleeping. Seems you and Drekan needed some rest.”

“WHA- 15!”

I couldn’t believe what I heard, Drekan had explained to me that Glorby runs on a 30-hour clock and that those hours are fairly close to human ones, but 15 hours straight of sleeping. I must have really needed it.

*And I was STILL TIRED! HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE BODY?!*

Jarekk was smiling because of my reaction, “I thought it might have just been a normal human thing, but judging by your expression, it doesn’t seem so. Drekan only woke up about an hour ago and he was straight to bed right after he came back inside. Oh and before I forget, I brought you a heater, it isn’t much but should take the edge off of these cold nights“

He placed the metal cube on the ground over by the door. Its size wasn’t very impressive, but anything would be a huge bonus. I can’t forget about the cold, it’s one of the reasons I hid in here, to begin with, *I couldn’t have imagined what I was getting myself into.* Jarekk continued,

“Oh, and another thing, take a gander.”

Jarekk leaned his rifle against the wall and placed his bag on the ground, after digging in it for a few seconds he pulled out what looked like a fruit and a plastic container. The fruit was pear-shaped with a bunch of uneven lumps all over its surface. The color was a very dark purple, similar to eggplants back on Earth. The plastic container also had what looked like food in it, as the lid was fogging up from the steam emitting from whatever was inside. Jarekk seemed eager to explain as he walked slowly towards me.

“So this fruit is called a ‘jimpter’ and they are made to wake us glorbian up. They are high in a compound called caffeine, do you know if that is poisonous to humans? I would imagine it’s fine but if that is like lethal, you don’t have to eat it.”

The thought of caffeine being deadly to humans was so laughable that I couldn't help but put a smile on my face. “Actually, most humans can’t live without the stuff! We have a plant called coffee that we turn into a drink with plenty of caffeine. I would be curious about how strong this is, but a few bites couldn’t hurt. That floopmor you gave me was delicious, and I’m still alive.”

The idea of eating did seem appealing, even though I wasn’t hungry, I knew that it would only take an hour or so until my stomach started fighting me in protest. I doubt these glorbians hearing my stomach rumble would put their minds at ease of the whole ‘eating people’ thing.

“Well if you insist, no pressure. And don’t get your hopes up, it isn’t as delicious as it looks. I also brought some of our sunset stew, it has some floopmor, wilo chunks, and various other vegetables, again only if you are hungry and if you think it's safe.”

After saying that he popped open the container to show a deep brown stew with bits of blue meat and also miscellaneous green and blue chunks in it. The aroma was powerful, and I wanted it immediately. I hastily said while standing up,

“It has to be safe, that smells delicious! I will take the risk!”

Once I started walking towards Jarekk, I saw a look of panic flash across his face as he realized my intention of grabbing the meal from him. Likely not wanting to be close to a hungry human, he quickly placed the plastic container on the ground of the shed and put the jimpter on the lit of said container. He then dashed away from the meal and stood a two or three feet away, within arm’s reach of the rifle. He wouldn’t break eye contact with me as I awkwardly picked up my food and returned to my makeshift bed.

The stew had a homemade scent, and the steam seemed to carry the taste to the mouth and nose. A hearty meal was awaiting me, but Jarekk didn’t bring a spoon, so I just elected to sip the soup from the container. I slowly lifted it to test the heat and make sure I would burn my mouth. Contact was made with my tongue, and once I noticed the heat was tolerable, I took a small sip. I let the stew sit in my mouth for a few seconds, just taking in the alien concoction.

*This. Is. Delicious!*

I was hit with a healthy amount of salt, mixed with a multitude of flavors that seemed so strong. The green floopmor inside gave the whole meal a sweet undertone, with multiple vegetables contributing and also balancing it out with a more neutral flavor. Its broth was a little less runny than the typical soup, allowing it to take up the space in my mouth and feel more whole and filling. I quickly swallowed before taking a larger slurp. This time a chunk of blue wilo entered the picture, chewy to start but quickly unraveled after a few bites. All of the ingredients were playing a masterful symphony in my mouth.

*A stew is something I didn’t know I needed right now.*

I began greedily slurping it rapidly, and after a few gulps, I paused to catch my breath. I looked toward Jarekk who was looking perpendicular to me with a large frown. His eyes were wide open and full of worry but weren’t moving from an undetermined point on the wall. He was also melting and shaking, an obvious signal that he was afraid at this very moment. I checked in on him by saying,

“Hey Jarekk are-“

“Agh!” he snapped out of his daze and quickly looked towards me, fear still plastered on his face, he was shaking.

“Jarekk? Talk to me what’s wrong?”

He seemed to realize the episode that he was having, he looked toward the ground and took a deep inhale before looking to his right, closing his eyes, and exhaling deeply. He seemed to collect himself before saying,

“Sorry, I . . . I didn’t think humans were such noisy eaters. I didn’t want to watch you eat, but when I wasn’t looking, my imagination just sorta ran wild.”

I suddenly became very self-conscious about the way I had been eating. They still see me as a cannibal, and I was just gorging myself on their stew. I doubt I would want to hear a supposed human eater enjoying their meal loudly, even if I knew it wasn’t humans it was eating. I didn’t want to think of what Jarekk would have been imagining with the sounds I was making.

*Probably worse than whatever I could imagine.*

“Oh, I’m sorry. We usually aren’t loud but I don’t have a spoon and well, I haven’t eaten anything this good in over a day.”

“Humans eat with spoons?” said Jarekk before having a huge epiphany show clearly on his face, Jarekk declared “Of course, humans eat with spoons! They can't . . . wow!”

I wasn’t connecting the dots for how he connected the dots, so I asked, “Yeah we do eat with spoons, why does that make sense?”

Jarekk chuckled before stating, “Well we only use spoons for stirring when it’s hot, because once the food is made, we take it to a table, wait for it to cool and-“

Jarekk held up his hand to show himself morphing it into a spoon shape, then pretended to sip something from it, before returning it to its resting shape. I slapped my forehead in amazement before saying,

“YOU ALWAYS HAVE A SPOON! THAT’S GENIUS!”

I was flabbergasted by how convenient that would be, it was no wonder he hadn’t brought a spoon, *He always brings a spoon!* My comment about him being a genius seemed to give Jarekk a satisfaction I hadn’t seen on his face since I had met him. Jarekk clarified,

“It is pretty nice to be a glorbian, just *really* need to wash your hands before and after a meal. I can start bringing a spoon with your meals, I probably should have asked.”

“All good, I probably should have asked for one as well, didn’t think about how terrifying I would be slurping right by you.”

“No problem, maybe try that jimpter, get that caffeine flowing through you. It might be a little harsh as some people like to put sugar on, hope you don’t mind. . . You know what sugar is right?”

“Again, humans are quite familiar with sugar, its something we are a little *too* familiar with if you catch my drift.”

Jarekk had a good chuckle and said, “It's scary how many things we have in common with humans.”

I thought about that fact before stating, “I find it comforting.”

I picked up and examined the lumpy purple fruit in front of me, sniffing revealed no information about it or its taste. I asked in clarification, “Can I eat the lumps?”

With a slight laugh he clarified, “Yeah, you can eat the lumps. How else would you eat it?”

I played up my defensiveness at his question for humor, “It’s from another world I don’t know! Maybe you can morph your hands into knives and slice around them! For all I know that hand can turn into a gun.”

Laughing Jarekk said, “If it could, you think I would have tried to run away from the giant human in my shed? I would have morphed into a plasma cannon, sent this shed to the northern sea, and walked inside to grab another jimpter!”

We both shared a good laugh about the ridiculousness of such an ability before I was once again made aware of the foreign fruit in my hands. My good mood made me more adventurous about this fruit. *Besides, the stew was delicious!*

*He told you not to get your hopes up.*

*Here goes nothing!*

A took a modest bite into the jimpter and was hit with an acidic fruit, almost lemon-like, but not quite the kick. It was straightforward to break off into the mouth but also had the firmness of an unripe apple while chewing. The flesh didn’t seem to have too much juice inside, just enough to give every bite some more acidic taste. It wasn’t particularly enjoyable, and it was hard to convince my body to go through and eat it, but if it is eaten to gain caffeine, then maybe I should go through with it. Something to keep me alert, especially knowing what kinds of predators are around, couldn’t hurt. After feeling enough pinches of sourness in my mouth, I decided to swallow the fruit. It left quite an awful aftertaste, but water seemed to wash it down. The glorbian in the room had decided to watch me eat that time, and seemed relatively unaffected, he commented,

“Do you hate it?”

The bluntness caught me a little off guard, “Uhhh, no? It *is* strange, but I can finish it off. The caffeine couldn’t hurt.”

“Fair enough, most people hate their first jimpter, and you didn’t seem as entranced by it as Fennora’s stew. Was just curious was all, also might want to be careful near the middle, there is a giant seed in there.”

I nodded in appreciation of the warning before asking, “So what is the plan for tonight? Wanna give me a run down?”

I thought that having Jarekk explain the plan while I ate would save us some awkward silence while I slurped my stew. He sat down, leaning against the wall perpendicular to the doors, and answered,

“So, the plan is for you to load up those gryneers into my pickup, and you will ride with them in the back. We have a short drive to our burn pit, throw them in, and I will light them up in the morning with the other accumulated trash in there. After we get back, we can head over and find your crashed ship. I think you understand but I would rather not be outside longer than we need to be, Predator attacks are fairly rare, but they happen enough that everyone here understands the risk. You had pretty bad luck with that attack happening in your first night.”

Shrugging while hastily swallowing my mouth full of stew I replied, “Yeah, I haven’t had the best luck as of late. Soooo what is the plan for my ship, we can’t leave it out in the open can we?”

Jarekk thought for a few seconds then looked at me before continuing, “Once I know where your escape pod landed, hopefully sometime I can get a trailer out there and then I can bring it into one of our barns, I doubt the wilos will mind. Does that ship of yours have wheels?”

Thinking back to it, I didn’t look that closely at what all of the buttons did, there might be a way to put out some emergency wheels, but I honestly replied, “I don’t know, I don’t think so?”

Jarekk spent a little more time thinking before saying, “Maybe I can get my tractor and drag it out, it would leave quite a mess, hmmm. I need to think about that, maybe get a good look at it, and see what I’m dealing with.”

“Fair enough, so we will see about the ship. After we get all these things figured out, what is the next step?”

“We wait.”

*Please don’t tell me he wants to wait for the human forces to take the planet, that could take a few months at the earliest!*

“Wait for?”

His posture seemed to slouch as he said, “The inevitable, the invasion of Glorby.”

*God Dammit.*

“I was worried you would say that, is there truly no other way?

“I’m open to ideas.”

I took another bite of the jimpter while I thought about it.

*What about a spaceship?*

I doubt that is very cheap, even on earth that is only for high-income households or businesses.

*What about stealing one?*

Who would we steal it from? Even if it weren’t the glorbian military, which seems impossible enough, they would likely report it and we would be gunned down before we left orbit. We would have to run into an allyship that would believe us and take us in.

*Wait, how would we even operate it?*

I have ridden in quite a few ships, but never have I driven one. Jarekk told me that none of the Zecklemire family has even been to space, I doubt flying glorbian ships would be easy.

*Could I even fit in a glorbian ship? Maybe we could jerry-rig my escape pod?*

Again, I don’t know the first thing about light-speed mechanics. How would I not only recharge the engine but also extend the range of our engine? Also, I don’t think any more than one person could comfortably rest inside of it.

. . .

*God Dammit.* I answered,

“I . . . I don’t know.”

“Yeah, me neither.”

We sat in a sad silence as I ate my meal. I would have to wait so long to see everyone, Dad, Gaige, and especially Reagan. *We had only been dating for 3 months, what is she going to do, move on?*

*Are they going to have my funeral?*

*Am I going to be able to visit my own grave?*

An undetermined amount of time before I could be brought back, the fact that there wasn’t a deadline would be the worst part. If I knew it was 6 months from now, I would count down every single day. Now, I’ll be counting up, hoping that today will be the day that I can go home. Looking towards the alien in the room, I looked at how down he was as well. The fear of knowing that the planet that you grew up on is very likely about to be forever changed would be terrifying. Humans were lucky for the fact that we were one of the first to reach the stars. Every sentient race that we encountered in space was much newer to FTL than we were, and we used that as leverage in our peace talks. Because of this, Earth has never been in danger of being invaded, We have only had one other interstellar war before the glorbians, and they were equally a push-over.

We still occupy their planet to this day, and the xeabunites have tried for many a rebellion. I just hope that it doesn’t have to come to that with the glorbians. I have met few of them but they seem kind-hearted, just, afraid. I think they must have started this war out of fear, I don’t know why they would have turned against us, but they must have just been afraid. I swallowed a mouth full of acidic jimpter before trying to raise Jarekk’s morale.

“Well, whenever that invasion happens, I will be here for you and your family Jarekk. I have said it before but just know, as long as I live, not one human will lay a hand on you guys. You will be safe, and maybe you could even come to Earth if Glorby is too heavily damaged by conflict.”

Jarekk seemed to pull himself out of his slump and replied, “Thanks Clyde, but don’t take this the wrong way, I would rather die than be surrounded by humans. I don’t think my heart could take that.”

“Ahh come on, admit it, you love us!”

He scoffed and said, “Can’t say I do sadly, maybe after you get way less terrifying, we can chat.”

I simply sighed and said, “Someday, you will get the hype.” I took a minute to finish my meal before asking Jarekk, “You think it’s late enough to get started?”

He opened the door to take a look and replied, “Looks pretty dark, we are almost ready, give me one second.” Jarekk then reached into his bag and pulled on something. I heard the clanking of metal before I saw it, he pulled out what appeared to be a big pile of chains. It *was* a big pile of chains, which he lifted up by one end and put on as if it were a T-shirt. It *was* a T-shirt, made of chains. It was more of a hoodie as the chains covered up the back side of his head with only his hands, his legs, and his face being exposed. Jarekk then piled chain pants out of his bag and began to put them on. This was the first time I had seen a glorbian wear anything, and it was chainmail armor? Curiosity took over as I asked,

“Uhhh, what is that you’re putting on?”

Jarekk looked up at me with a sort of shocked expression before seemingly remembering that I was an alien unfamiliar with everything around me. He continued to equip his gear, explaining, “Oh, it’s anti-bite gear, which keeps me safe from gryneers and the like. Sorry I don’t have one human-sized, but you seem to be able to handle yourself.”

It was shocking how obvious it would be to make gear designed for the predators in the area, I guess I just sort of assumed that they took the injuries and death on the chin. Of course, they would try to mitigate the loss of life, and this armor was an effective way to do that.

“So if that protects you from creatures, why didn’t you wear it here?”

“Well, this gear restricts my morphing, I can walk with less fear, but I can’t enter or leave any buildings unless they have a giant overhead door.” Gesturing towards the ‘giant’ overhead door. “Also, it is very heavy, it’s around seven pounds, which can really slow someone down.”

*Seven pounds huh?*

“Seven? Jarekk, if you don’t mind me asking, how much do you weigh?”

“Last I checked, roughly 45 pounds, needing to lay off of them sweets.”

*That. Is. Adorable. Assuming Jarekk weighs the most, which I would assume as he is the tallest, I could bench all 3 of them sitting on a pole. I should offer that sometime.*

Still not having looked at me, he began tightening his belt and asked, “How much do you weigh Clyde?”

I gained a large grin as I said nonchalantly, “200 pounds.”

He slowly lifted his head up, wide eyes and agape mouth clearly showed his shock. Clearly shocked, he continued tightening his belt while asking, “Is that . . . is that normal?”

“I . . . don’t honestly know, I might be a little over, but I’m probably close to the average.”

Jarekk finished putting on his armor, and let that information sink in before saying in confusion, “What dumbass thought that we could win this war?”

My brain immediately played devil’s advocate, “Well, no matter how big we are, if you shoot us in the head, we die either way. I think that was their plan.”

“Fair enough.” He stood in thought for a few seconds before asking, “Are you ready to get to work?”

I honestly didn’t really want to do any lifting, but I thought that the sooner we get this done with, the less likely we are to be caught. “Yeah, let's get this over with.”

Dressed in his medieval attire, Jarekk reached up to the button that opened the overhead door and gave it a good press. The sudden noise was much louder than our conversation, but my ears quickly adjusted to the change in volume. Slowly but surely the door rose from the concrete foundation. Considering I had slammed it to the ground just a day ago, I was very happy to see that it was still working. I would have felt quite bad if the first thing I did was break something. Cold night air seeped through the opening and first hit my legs, then my entire body. Though chilly, the air was quite still, which I silently thanked, as I had no winter clothing to protect me from the elements. Once again, I saw the planet of Glorby, still as foreign as ever. I walked into a dark world that awaited me, with my eyes trying to adjust and take in the new stimuli.

Jarekk turned off the shed lights and declared, “I’m gonna bring the truck over, you can wait here and throw those gryneers in the bed when I pull up. Scream if you need help, expect I’ll do the same.” He pressed the door closing button on his way out. I watched Jarekk walk away from the one light situated by the shed and into the darkness towards his truck.

Trying to pass the time, I tried to take in my surroundings as best as I could. Though blanketed in shadows, I could still see the Zecklemire house with its glowing windows. The next thing I noticed was the battleground before me. I hadn’t seen the gryneers that Jarekk had killed, just heard the shots and was forced to smell them now and then. I counted 4 of them in total, they looked heavier than I would have liked, but doable. I looked up into the sky to see the stars starting to appear over the ever-darkening twilight. The sky was that same blackish blue that the nights of Earth were but with stars in foreign locations. It is like a children’s drawing, with dots randomly placed, no big dipper, no belt of Orion, no familiarity.

I jolted as the pickup truck roared to life a distance in front of me, and I suddenly remembered that I was effectively in the middle of the wilderness with creatures that could attack from anywhere.

*Shit, I didn’t bring a weapon!*

Turning around a lifting up the shed door, I reached over and looked at my weapons of trade. A tiny hammer, wrench, bloody screwdriver, or a piece of lumber. Mulling it over for only a few seconds I ended up grabbing the screwdriver once more. Though it was smaller than I would have liked, I had proven its efficacy against gryneers. The lumber might be too cumbersome, and the hammer and wrench didn’t seem the fastest and most energy efficient. The screwdriver could pierce quickly and with one strike, meanwhile, the other options would take multiple hits to kill via blunt force, *probably.*

*I didn’t really know, that just sounds right . . . right?*

Stashing the screwdriver in my pocket, I walked back outside right as Jarekk was pulling up to the gryneer graveyard. It was bizarre seeing a pickup sort of like one on Earth, just half the size. It was a white four seater but couldn’t have been taller than four feet. Like a teenager version of those tiny cars made for kids to drive around in. It was much more rounded off than the typical pickup, which gave it a very sleek design. Noticing that I went back into the shed, he rolled down the passenger window and yelled out, “What did you forget?”

“A weapon. I thought that screwdriver might be handy!”

“Hopefully I can shoot them before you have to use a screwdriver, but I guess it doesn’t hurt to be prepared.”

I had a feeling that the roaring engine at this time of night would be a dinner bell to any predators out and about near us, so I quickly got to work. I grabbed the gryneer I had stabbed first, its body already reeked and was cold to the touch. I stood over the creature with it between my two legs and wiggled my fingers underneath the corpse to get a good grip. My hands were instantly covered in a viscous cold liquid once I was under the creature, I didn’t know if it was blood, excrement, or some third alien goop, either way, instinctively a shiver ran up my spine and I gagged.

*Awful. Awful. Awful. I hate this.*

Regaining my composure, I decided that my original plan of lifting the corpse up and onto my shoulder was the worst idea in the history of ideas. Now, I would simply lift it up between my legs and shimmy to the truck to get it into the pickup without the cold awful fluids touching anywhere on my body. Picking up the gryneer, I realized how awful this was to carry, and the liquids made it very hard to hold onto. Pain tugged on my wounded left arm, realizing that I shouldn’t get these fluids up on my bandages. I knew that I only needed to move it around six feet, so the seconds it was off the ground I power walked to the pickup, and as my grip started to loosen, I quickly lifted up and flung the corpse into the truck. *THUD. The* full weight impacted the inside of the truck bed causing it to shake. Jarekk, who had been watching my back for predators, looked rather shocked by the creature's impact.

*God this sucks . . . My arm is burning, Lifted with my back, not my legs . . . One out of four, it’s a start.*

I looked at my hands to see a dark blue liquid drenching them, and it was running down my hands onto my arms. *Gross. Gross. Gross. God, I hope I get hosed down tonight.* Walking over to the next gryneer, I decided that my strategy was about as good of one as I was getting. I checked my surroundings to make sure that we weren’t attracting company, and the coast seemed clear. A burn hole on the side of its head signified the accuracy of Jarekk’s aim with a plasma rifle. I planned to make sure I had a better grip to ensure that I wouldn’t drop it, but the second I retouched the cold blood I instantly wanted to stop touching it, grip be damned. I shuffled then tossed the second corpse into the truck.

*THUD.*

*Half-way there.*

Picking my third target, I saw yet another burn hole through the skull. *Jarekk is a damn good shot, if he ever trusted me enough to teach me, I could probably learn a thing or two.* Picking up number three and doing my little shuffle to the truck, I threw it rapidly into the bed of the pickup with a loud *THUD.* I found the last gryneer I shimmied my hand underneath its body but found that my right hand was a little off. While wriggling my hand underneath the corpse’s texture changed from furry to . . . *not.* I rolled the gryneer over to take a look and to my horror realized that I had wiggled my hand into a burn hole in the creature's abdomen. I pulled my hand out rapidly and some gore came with my hand. I stood in shock for a few seconds as a chill ran down my spine. I felt my stomach twirl into a knot, and I tried to resist a tug on my throat to vomit. Recomposing myself and performing the shuffle technique I brought the final grynner to and promptly threw into the pickup. *THUD.*

*Four out of four, I need a shower. Bad.*

I stepped into the back of the truck and felt it lurch in response to me stepping into it, I said to Jarekk, “All four gryneers are in the back, we ready to go?”

“Yeah we should be good to go, the pit is right over there. Can push them out of the pickup and into the burning pit.”

I tried to make myself comfortable before realizing that would involve sitting on a bunch of bloodied corpses, so I decided to sit on the edge of the pickup. I made sure not to put my full weight on the edge in case it wasn’t designed to take a human’s weight. The trip to the pit was only a few minutes long, as it would be visible from the shed if not for some trees. The road there wasn’t particularly bumpy, but the precarious position I was sitting in exaggerated every tiny bump. The headlights of the truck did well to pierce the night's darkness, but only in a small radius, leaving me anxious about what might lurk just outside of our vision.

Jarekk backed up to the pit and I hopped out to pull the gate down and quickly got to work dragging the gryneers out. Jarekk made his way out of the pickup to stand there and watch me work, with his plasma rifle in hand. I would have been annoyed, but I knew he couldn’t do the same amount of heavy lifting. Him trying to help would have only been a gesture. Just as I was thinking that, Jarekk began to scan the area around us. It was also nice to know that he was willing to look out for me, even if it was just to his benefit.

*Pull the gryneer’s leg, then grab and fling it into the pit, rinse, and repeat.*

After doing that with the fourth and final gryneer I breathed a sigh of relief knowing that all of the labor was over. Now for the mental gymnastics of trying to remember what path I had taken to get here, I was just going to try and follow the angle of which I first saw their house, then retrace my steps. Jarekk had already started towards the driver’s seat of his pickup, and I decided to close the bed door and hop back in. He shouted from the front without looking at me,

“How are you holding up? I must say, that was much quicker than if I used my tractor to carry them over here.”

I reexamined myself after all of this work. My hands and some bits of my clothes were sticky from working with these bloodied corpses, but other than that, I wasn’t any worse for wear. I replied to him, “Alright, I was just wondering if I could get a bath at some point.”

Kicking the pickup out of park, he said, “Well, if you don’t mind cold water, we have a high-pressure hose to wash the wilos with. It is fairly painful on direct skin, but maybe for humans, it will be a little more tolerable, I could probably mess with the pressure if you would like.”

“I don’t care how cold it is, just some water to get this gunk off, and maybe some way to wash these clothes?”

Jarekk thought for a moment before declaring, “Well we have some detergent, a line to hang them on, and a beautiful black tarp to wear while your clothes dry.”

*Rocking a tarp toga wasn’t what I had on my Glorby bucket list.*

With a laugh, I said, “Thanks, maybe I will like the tarp better than my current clothes!” and we both shared a laugh. I sat on the bed’s edge once again to avoid sitting in any blood. We quickly arrived back at the concrete pad, the natural resting place of Jarekk’s pickup. I hopped out of the truck as Jarekk killed the engine and stepped out of the cab. I was now just realizing how tired Jarekk must be, but he seemed to be holding onto his senses.

*Must have had quite a few jimpters.*

I asked, “So, are we heading to the escape pod?”

Grabbing his rifle from the truck and shutting the door he looked at me and said, “Yup, lead the way human.”

*I just hoped I remembered the way, it would be quite an impression to get us both lost in the middle of the night.*

Making sure we were ready I clarified, “So do we have a way to get back here in case I happen to get us lost?”

Jarekk pointed to his bag and said, “I'm bringing my GPS just in case, I don’t think they can track that, but if they can I can just say that I was looking for a loose wilo. Also . . .”

Digging into his bag of goodies, he pulled out a rather tiny flashlight for me to use and held it as far away from himself as possible to hand it to me. I thanked him for the consideration and decided that we should start going. Recalling my memory, I tried to decipher which direction I remembered seeing the house from and told Jarekk to follow me.

You know how every city thinks it’s the best place for coffee? Well, I’m here to officially tell you that you're wrong. The best coffee comes from Coorg, India and yes, that's where I’m from. While you’re sipping on your standard brews, my coffee is over here, looking like a celebrity that deserves its own red carpet.

I’m looking to expand into your cities and supply you with the finest coffee beans, ground coffee, or even just a quick caffeine fix for your office. It doesn’t matter what kind of coffee you need from Arabica to Robusta, instant coffee to espresso blends, I’ve got it all. No, really, I have all of it. If it’s coffee-related, I’m your guy.

Why am I doing this? Well, because someone has to share this liquid gold with the world, and I’m tired of seeing people drink mediocre coffee in the Middle East. Let’s face it , it’s time to level up your coffee game.

If you're interested in a collaboration, whether it’s wholesale supply, retail, or just a coffee revolution, hit me up. Let's talk about how we can make your customers love coffee even more (if that’s possible). After all, coffee is the one thing that brings people together and, let’s be real, it’s what powers most of us through the workday.

Looking forward to hearing from you. Let's brew something amazing together.

We first met at a coffee shop with the Dutch. Those girls didn’t respect me at first. I ordered an Apple Pie for us. As I talked about my aspirations, those Dutch girls got more interested in me. You complained about how you moved here for some guy and how you hated their food.

We continued the date to a museum where I noticed the other girls interested in me. We took some pics and walked back near an instrumentalist. You seemed visibly frustrated with me complaining about bad of date we’re having. But, you were probably mad I looked at the other girls.

We next stopped at a Korean restaurant ran by Chinese people, and they denied us access probably because they knew I was American. We switched to a burger place, and I noticed how socially weird I was. I need to work on that. I found out you were a magazine editor.

We then went to go get drinks and smoked a blunt. As we were walking, some guy with a boombox came by with rap music, and you dissed his taste in music. The weed was subpar compared to California’s. As we walked back, an Asian girl looked at us visibly angry and walked towards me and stopped right in front of me. She realized I was not from there and moved on.

We lastly, stopped at a bar where you were disgusted by how uncleanly it was. Our French bartender was a dick and hit on you. Your face went red, and I got a little jealous. I rolled up my sleeves and ordered you an orange juice, then a beer for myself. The bartender said something like, “Take care of your wife.” You got mad at me for even ordering a drink.

We walked near my hotel and asked you to come up, sounded like a girl though -_-. I regret doing so because I put your health in danger. You rejected me by yelling at me, “What kind of girl do you think I am?” We decided to end the night, and I walked you back to the train.

And that’s where I got the most romantic kiss of my life. You put your head against mine, and I awkwardly realized what you were doing and followed suit. The people that saw us cheered. You got on the train, and I looked at you for the last time. 

I left you a goodbye text and was happy you returned it. I deleted the text message, so I didn’t get attached. But, I will always remember that kiss, next to the train, under the stars in Holland.",1,1731904449.0,u_CattleSea316,1,1.0,False

My thoughts on her life story:

- What a cool, funny woman. She had an interesting life. 
- Her mom was left alone for 24-30 months with 8 children while the dad was off on a mission to Norway. The mom died about a year after he got home from the Spanish flu.
- It’s so cute that my great-grandmother tried to make coffee for German prisoners of war and they hated it. 
- Missionary work has never been safe. Those poor boys. 
- They were senior missionaries and had to get the approval of their mission president to have their adult daughter fly in to be with her husband in the hospital? So controlling. And weird that she felt she had to mention the fact that it was approved. 
- A stake dance in the early 1970s was the first time she saw strobe lights haha.

My current girlfriend is absolutely amazing and has really been a great partner in all aspects. Her and I are still learning eachother and getting to know one another but there has been one part of this relationship that I have anxieties with. When we were first seeing each other she told me of this classmate named Brian and how he would ask her out. She ended up telling him “I actually am going to see my girlfriend this weekend” and he stopped talking to her for the entire weekend. Then came out of no where and ask if she wanted to meet up and study at a coffee shop. Mind you, she usually tells me all of this after the fact and has been honest with everything that’s happened from my knowledge. Then on Halloween, she randomly sees him and Brian starts talking to her about how he had been seeing this girl and how much he made out with her. My girlfriend then tell me that he started saying things like “I really wish I had someone to go out with”. My girlfriend responded with “oh well you should ask the girl you’re going out with” and that’s been the end of it till yesterday. I asked her if she has heard from him lately and she said he had been gone for the past two weeks because a close family member died. My girlfriend had offered to catch him up on homework tonight and I want to trust her fully but I also can’t help but think he will try something on her as he has been relentless. My girlfriend has been asked out by multiple guys at her school and it’s always been something she tells me after it happens. 

We had a conversation yesterday about her honest thoughts on cheating and she said she doesn’t understand how someone could live with themselves from emotionally damaging someone in that way. Also that she doesn’t have any interest in men. I told her that as long as he doesn’t cross a line I’m chill. I just feel like it’s disrespectful for him to keep trying with my girlfriend when I know he knows.

1gtwldp,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1gtwldp/where_to_meet_mormonsexmormons_outside_of_slc/,Where to meet Mormons/Ex-Mormons outside of SLC.,"Hello,I'm new to posting on reddit, this is my first time posting and i found this group randomly and wanted to share my experiences with ex-Mormons and current Mormons. You can call me T(Im not the best at writing and hopefully this will make sense due to time skips). I'm Catholic and was raised in the Church and I've always been interested in Mormonism ever since I was in 5th grade. We were studying world religions/creeds other than Catholicism. I took basically a list of a bunch of religions, randomized them, and landed on one. The one I landed on was Mormonism. Since this was in 2005, I had to go to the library and find books on Mormonism, check them all out of the library and actually bring them home/back to be read. Anyway, one of the books checked out that day was the one of four copies of the book of Mormom. Some may think it was weird that I enjoyed reading it but I've always liked/been interested in dogma and religious stories/""mythologies"" for the lack of better words. I finished my studying which culminated into a project of me, rather poorly, creating a clay sculpture of the Church in SLC. 

Years pass, references to Mormons always seemed to pop up. On the news, in TV shows, people I met why getting service hours done, etc. At this point I'm in college as a sophomore taking French 1102. In walks in a openly friendly, smiling, welcoming body languaged fellow who looks to be in his mid 30s. Turns out he's the professor. He had funny habits in my opinion. When we would talk about certain aspects of life, specifically community service(we talked a lot after class because I was in the French language society and tutored other students). He mentions to me that he went on a Missionary trip to an island owned by the French government where he did community/direct service for thr people on the island. I had him as a professor for two more semesters and slowly started to piece things together. The Missionary trip, certain drinks he wouldn't drink at social gatherings, family practices, and similar morals and dogmas. One day during class on our last week before exams we were all talking and asking him questions about his life as a young kid and what his family is like. I remember asking him why he doesn't drink coffee or soda. I don't drink coffee but not for any special reasons, I just don't  care for it. I pressed him on the soda though and he just said ""he can't"" as he took a swig from his water bottle, then boom. A bomb/light bulb went off in my mind and me being an outgoing yapper I said ""Wait you're Mormon!"" I didn't say it like I had caught him or in an accusatory manner or in disgust like ""oh....you're Mormon?"" I hope that makes sense, the Penticostals do it down here in the South to us Catholics and it pissed me off that people would judge. Tangent over, he looked perplexed that I had pieced everything together and asked me how I came to the conclusion so I explained and he smiled and said ""good observation."" 

All that to say, because of him, Dr.J is what I'll call him, a new branch on my ""interest in Mormonism tree grew."" So the next day was study day where classes weren't in session but the teachers were in their offices to provide study help for students. I went by and wanted to ask him many things about the church and his life. It made me even more curious, an innocent curiosity really, strictly based on how cool/good of a guy he was. It was almost like I looked up to him. Which made me wonder about a lot of male role middle figures in my life and he's for sure top 3(family not included.) The exam came, I aced it, and went on to finish my bachelor's, graduate and masters degree with a masters I'm Forensic Pathology. I would see him on campus and swing by to his office and talk to him. One day at the end of spring semester when I was finishing up my masters I went back to the main campus and told him about all the cool stuff I learned and what I was going to do after I was done with school. During the meeting, he drops that he's leaving the state and moving back to SLC. I was kind of sad because he was a cool dude, minus the fact that he doesn't drink soda, but that's not a big deal. We went our separate ways and there are still many things I wanted to ask him and as of writing this I am finding it rather hilarious I'm on reddit in an ex-Mormon subreddit talking about how great this guy is but that's why I'm writing this, 

I'd like some advice. Almost every Mormon or ex-Mormon I've met has always been a good person to me and in general. Hell, sometimes better to me than people in my own faith or other sects of Christianity. What is a good way to find a Mormon community in a town? I live in a city that's pretty large with sports teams and no it's not Atlanta but I'm afraid of simply speaking to Mormon, showing up at a service because it might look weird, not knowing what to Google to find Mormons or ex-mormons in my town. This seems so odd writing, but I have a genuine interest in learning/getting to know people who were or are involved in the Church. I don't want to convert or make them think I'm interested in that, so how do you go about being friends or joining the community? Is it weird for an ""outsider"" to want to do this, or am I just weird? All answers welcome along with criticisms.

1gtwjln,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BRETTBURGETT/comments/1gtwjln/does_it_take_a_while_for_your_doordash_order_to/,Does it take a while for your doordash order to get accepted?? This could be why,"Doordash Platinum Driver tip suggestions

Hello I am a full time dasher in Ne Ohio. I dash 35-55hrs a week. My rating is 4.97, never been below 98% completed deliveries, 94% on time. I am writing this simply as my opinion on how I feel customers should tip. 

There are several things to consider. The 1st is how many miles is between you and the store you are ordering from. I get some offers wanting me to deliver an order 9 miles away and only offer me $4. That is $2 from doordash and $2 from the customer. I will quickly decline that order. If it would have been $9 offer I would have considered it. $12 or more I would accept it immediately. If you tip at least $1 a mile from you to the store plus the couple dollars doordash pays I can almost guarantee that your delivery will be quickly accepted.

Next thing to consider is the the time of day you are ordering. From midnight to 5am there aren't many drivers on the road, so doordash typically offers the highest tipping offers 1st, and will try to throw in a non tip with it if they can. But since it's not busy during those times you might want to consider upping your tip to guarantee acceptance. I get told by several places that overnight a lot of orders never get picked up. After working several of those shifts I understand why. Also during lunch 11am-1pm and dinner 5pm-8pm there may be more drivers but there are also a lot more orders. During these times they're are also a lot of dashers that don't have very good ratings and only take high paying orders because they are extremely limited in when they can log in. Me as a platinum driver I usually get offered higher paying orders. My acceptance rate still stays between 70 and 80% because I RARELY accept an order that doesn't at least come close to $1 a mile. 

Next if you live out in the sticks please keep in mind the driver has to get the food way out to you then get all the way back to an area that they can get orders from. I will quickly deny an order paying $12 to go 10 miles when it is going to take me 20 minutes each way. I try to keep myself at $20 an hr. 

Last factor, during busy times I try to stay away from fast food, and even a few sit down restaurants that regularly take much longer to make doordash orders. 1 example is taco bell. They have 3 to 4 people working the drive thru and 1 person handing all mobile and online orders. Causing wait times upwards of 30 minutes. If it isn't a generous tip I'm not waiting more than 10 minutes at any restaurant. 

If you see this as ridiculous let me try to put it into perspective. Dashers use their own vehicle, pay for all there own gas and maintenance. I have to get my oil changed every 2 weeks, windshield wipers and air filters every few months, and brand new tires once a year. Plus any other repairs that need to be made. I have to pay an increased rate on my insurance, and eat most of my meals on the go. I make decent enough money to continue dashing. I am not really complaining, just trying to point out why some may not get there deliveries very quick and sometimes not at all. Yes you do have to pay an increased price on the food, and a service fee to doordash and a delivery fee. But 90% of the orders I get offered only pays me $2 from doordash. 

A tip is a gratuity, paying someone for the convenience of you not having to leave the house or work to get your order. If you don't have a car, then even more take care of the person delivering your food. If you just can't afford to tip, then don't order… COOK!! 

In closing, please don't think a percentage tip is appropriate for a doordash order unless it surpasses all the above mentioned factors. If all you want is an iced coffee from dunkin and you are 7 miles from the dunkin you are ordering from, then maybe look for a closer dunkin or go without. I'm not gong to accept, and knew many other drivers that won't accept that order for less than $7. 

I have had several people ask me what I feel is an appropriate tip for a doordash driver, friends and family included. I tell them all this same stuff. I'm going to make my money regardless so you can take this into consideration or you can just keep waiting longer on your order. For those that appropriately tip I am extremely grateful to you, you are the reason I continue doing this. To everyone God Bless and have a wonderful day!!

1. The house is ridiculous. Not a good kind of “wow” ridiculous but HUGE and considering how much time, money and reno went into it….its ugly and lacks character, no matter how much $$$ she threw at her designer….it’s so painfully drab (and beige)

2. I don’t care how active you are before/during your pregnancy, she flings herself around like a child on a playground and it’s unsettling. The first time she threw herself onto her stomach in the first trimester really got to me, but she still moves with 0 regard to that little baby in there😩

3. The obnoxious dancing???? Why. Not cute, not quirky, not funny. Adding the “match my freak” sound to it and sexualizing her pregnancy is really f-ing weird. We get it, you got pregnant the same way every other human gets pregnant E

4. Whatever, not going to judge drinking coffee while pregnant…doctors say you can have up to 250 mg of caffeine, no shade. But she really said uncaffeinated instead of decaffeinated and it irked me LOL. I need to touch grass because of all of the stupid stuff this ding dong does, the “uncaffeinated” is what got to me 😂😂😂

We do have a water dispenser with temperature options 40C/75C/85C so nobody uses kettle. What if I have a fixed temperature water, how should I start testing coffee (1 cup per day), should I start with finer grind, water volume, or steep time?

I'm also looking for a manual grinder recommendation, I've read about how important it is so here are my requirements:  
Budget: anything between $100 to $200, to explore more options  
Function: Convenience, Small (just to avoid electric grinder),   
Coffee: Aeropress, but might go for espresso machine depending on my future house in 1\~2 years (looking at Breville Bambino Plus).  
Taste: Total untrained tongue, I can only taste if the coffee is sour/bitter, I wasn't able to taste those chocolaty notes, or berry notes, so the most expensive grinder would be wasted on me.  
Beans: Medium-dark / dark roasts, because I couldn't taste the delicate notes in lighter roasts, so I prefer bitter than sour.

Based on my country, I'm able to find, Timemore C2, C3 line (only C3 ESP can support espresso?), 1zpresso K-ultra, X-ultra, J-ultra, J, JX-Pro, Q, ZP6 (1zpresso is still very confusing to me), Kingrinder K6 (weirdly couldn't find K4), and Kingrinder P-series
