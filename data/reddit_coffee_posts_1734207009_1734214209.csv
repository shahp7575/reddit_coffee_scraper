1hedon7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/1hedon7/do_dentists_care_about_patients_or_profits_help/,Do dentists care about patients or profits? Help me if this idea is worth pursuing!,"**TL;DR: Seeking Feedback on My Startup Idea to Improve Transparency in Dentistry**

I’m married to a dentist, work as a financier, and have spent over a decade managing dental practices. Through this, I’ve seen the challenges patients face in navigating the dental industry, such as lack of transparency, overtreatment, and inconsistencies in pricing and care quality. These issues are amplified by the complexity of dental insurance and the varying ethics among dentists, leaving many patients frustrated and distrustful of the industry.

To address these problems, I’m working on a startup that aims to improve access, transparency, and trust in dental care. Here’s how it works:

* **Marketplace for Ethical Dentists**: A network of vetted dentists committed to high ethical standards.
* **Affordable Exams**: Patients can get free or low-cost exams (e.g., $25), including x-rays and 3D scans.
* **Remote Quotes**: Dentists review the scans and provide preliminary quotes without the pressure of being in the chair.
* **Patient Benefits**: Transparency in pricing and treatment plans, access to multiple second opinions, and discounts for last-minute appointment slots.
* **Dentist Benefits**: A marketing platform to attract patients aligned with their expertise and the ability to fill unused chair time.

My goal is to connect patients with trustworthy dentists while giving dentists a platform to showcase their skills. By improving transparency and access, I hope to restore trust and reduce the perception that “all dentists are scammers.”

**Question for Redditors**: Do you think this startup idea is worth pursuing? Would this service be valuable to you or others? I’m eager for honest feedback as I test this concept.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Full version**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am married to a dentist, work as a financier, and have helped launch and manage two general dental practices over the past decade. This hands-on experience has given me a deep understanding of what it takes to run a successful dental office—from marketing and accounting to leveraging technology and streamlining operations. My wife and I are deeply committed to maintaining high ethical standards in our practices, which is reflected in our patients’ loyalty. Many of them have been with us for over 10 years, often bringing along friends and family. This level of trust and connection reassures us that we’re on the right path.

And reading through this reddit thread, I realized I understand what the patients are going through, but also what the dentists are going through.

[“Is there a dentist scam going on in NYC?”](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/1f8cp84/is_there_a_dentist_scam_going_on_in_nyc/)

Before continuing, I want to clarify that I’m sharing this from the perspective of a patient who happens to be married to a dentist for the last 15+ years. While my tone may come across as critical at times to the dentist, it is rooted in personal experience and a desire to shed light on the challenges within the dental industry. My wife often reminds me to tread carefully when discussing dentists, and I strive to balance honesty with respect.

**My wife’s Conservative Approach to Dentistry**

My wife’s treatment philosophy prioritizes the preservation of natural teeth whenever possible. For instance, if a tooth is on the borderline between requiring a filling ($300–$400) or a root canal and crown ($2,000–$3,000), she typically recommends starting with the less invasive filling. If a tooth was 1,000 milligrams, she’d rather take 20 milligrams (filling), than 500 milligrams (crown). Similarly, if the decision is between a root canal/crown and an implant ($5,000–$6,000), she usually opts for the root canal first.

Her core belief is that a natural tooth is superior to any artificial alternative, which can discolor both tooth and gum over time and more change to lead to complications and discomfort. Patients are given clear choices and plenty of time to decide, with regular check-ups to monitor progress. If a conservative treatment doesn’t work as planned in the next a few months, she offers the more advanced procedure at no extra charge, applying the earlier cost as a credit. This balanced approach avoids overtreatment while ensuring patients receive appropriate care, resulting in high satisfaction. However, this methodology doesn’t bring in huge profits—contrary to the stereotype that all dentists drive Ferrari and Porsche-911-turbo.

**Ethics in Dentistry: A Harsh Reality**

Until a few years ago, I assumed all dentists were like my wife—offering ethical, patient-first care at fair prices. However, I’ve come to realize that the dental industry is much more complex. Factors like insurance coverage, dentists’ preferences, location, and even greed can create a system where patients are left gambling with their dental health unless they are well-informed. Sadly, a few bad-apple dentists can tarnish the reputation of the entire field.

For patients with Medicaid, Medicare, or low-end private insurance (DMO), the challenges are more apparent. Reimbursement rates for procedures are so low—just $20 for cleanings, $30–$50 for fillings, and $150 for crowns—that many practices struggle to cover even basic operating costs like rent, supplies, and staffing. This often results in compromised care, with hygienists rushing through cleanings in just 5–10 minutes or dentists opting for quick fixes instead of dedicating adequate time to patient care.

In contrast, our practices prioritize patient experience by allocating a minimum of 30–45 minutes to an hour per appointment, even though it’s not financially rewarding. The reality is that overhead costs eat up most of the profit from dental cleanings, and this is true for many general practices. For instance, hygienists now earn $60–$80 per hour, not including the cost of supplies and rent, while reimbursements from non-DMO insurances typically range from $150 to $250 per cleaning. The math often doesn’t add up, but we believe that quality care should never be sacrificed. But not all dentists are the same.

From what I’ve observed, dentists who accept these low-reimbursement insurances typically fall into one of three categories:

1. **Older dentists** treating patients as a hobby as they enjoy treating patients, unconcerned with profitability. Definitely trustworthy, although they may be a little slow on technologies like 3D scans and new techniques.
2. **Newer practices** that accept these insurances temporarily (a couple of years) to build a patient base, only to drop them later. Patients who once loved these dentists often feel disappointed when the practices stop accepting their plans and raise prices.
3. **Unethical dentists** who overprescribe unnecessary treatments or expensive elective procedures to offset revenue losses—often at the expense of the patient’s natural teeth.

**The Problem with Transparency**

One of the most significant issues in dentistry is the lack of transparency. Costs vary widely depending on location and practice policies. For instance, a friend paid $6,000 for a treatment in Manhattan, $4,000 of which was out of pocket. When he asked my wife what she would charge, her estimate was $3,000, with just $1,000 out of pocket—which she would have waived entirely. This highlights how much pricing inconsistency exists, even for identical procedures, not far far away.

Getting a second opinion can be equally frustrating. It’s often expensive ($100-200), time-consuming, and inconvenient. Many patients don’t know what questions to ask or how to evaluate treatment plans, which leaves them stuck with their original dentist—even if they’ve had a bad experience. You then wait for another year to play another roulette to find that good dentist, but you’re not getting a second opinion by then, as it just turned into another first opinion. And you go on and on and on, never closing the loop. This cycle contributes seems to widespread distrust in the dental industry.

**Examples of Overtreatment**

The worst cases of overtreatment are truly egregious. On a dentist-only discussion board, one practitioner bragged about convincing a patient to replace a chipped tooth (normally a $300 filling) with four crowns costing $8,000. Asking my wife what she would’ve done, told me that a good dentist should make a filling nearly invisible. If the filling keeps falling, they she would’ve recommend veneers (which require much less tooth alteration) over crowns; again, keep your tooth as long as you can.

In another instance, some dentists refer to cash-paying patients as “bums,” charging exorbitant fees while offering minimal insurance assistance. Others misuse insurance codes, like the infamous “D-9999,” to inflate charges for unnecessary procedures. And the patients would just see “other services” on their insurance benefits mail, which they can’t now fight against the doctor.

There are also dentists who treat your insurance’s annual maximum coverage as “their money,” overprescribing treatments simply to exhaust the benefit limit. My wife, on the other hand, rarely comes close to maxing out my insurance plan of $8000 per year for the family; I wish she would. Lol

# Second opinions really important

Getting a second opinion in dentistry can be costly, time-consuming, and, at times, uncomfortable—but it’s often essential. Dentistry is both a science and an art, meaning two dentists could look at the same x-ray and recommend completely different treatments. Unfortunately, some dentists may overtreat for financial gain.

For example, a patient once came to us after being told by another dentist that she had 10 cavities. She was shocked because she rarely had any cavities and had been getting regular check-ups. When my wife reviewed her x-rays, she discovered that all 10 ""cavities"" were actually coffee stains. This was a clear case of either the dentist attempting to grind away healthy teeth for unnecessary procedures, or just looked at the same stain on the tooth different.

However, keep in mind that drastic changes in dental health can happen. Personally, I went from having zero cavities to developing 10 in a single year—thanks to frequent visits to Max Brenner while dating my wife. We never went to Max Brenner after fixing all those cavities. So, while uncommon, significant shifts in dental health in a short period aren’t impossible.

# The Complexity of Dental Insurance

Adding to the confusion is the complexity of U.S. dental insurance. Insurance companies often dictate what they’ll pay based on the dentist’s location, their network status, and when they joined. Payments can be unpredictable—claims are frequently denied for no apparent reason, partial payments are made arbitrarily, and administrative hurdles create endless frustration for dental offices. This is why many dentists are transitioning away from insurance altogether, opting for fee-for-service models or creating their own in-house insurance plans.

The reimbursement gap is another issue. For instance, if a dental office charges $500 for a procedure but insurance only reimburses $250, the dentist will ask you to cover the remaining $250. However, another office across the street might charge $800 for the same procedure, receive $400 from insurance, and then require you to pay the remaining $400. These discrepancies make it crucial for patients to shop around and compare options.

That said, shopping for dental care isn’t as straightforward as calling practices to ask for prices. Dentists can’t give accurate quotes over the phone without examining your teeth or reviewing x-rays, as every case is unique. While it’s understandable that patients want to compare costs, dentists often dislike ""price-shopping"" inquiries because they oversimplify what is ultimately a highly individualized service.

**Finally, my questions to redditors: Is my startup idea worth pursuing?**

I’m currently working on a startup, and while I’m not one to self-promote (which, ironically, is probably not the best trait for running a business!), I genuinely believe this idea has the potential to make a real difference. I'm also not going to be promoting my wife’s dental office either. I truly want a real opinion from people. I believe this will address a significant gap in the dental industry, but want to know your thoughts. If you feel this startup is something people truly need, I’d appreciate your support and feedback as I navigate the challenges of bringing it to life over the next few months. Fingers crossed that it resonates with those it’s meant to help!

Here’s how it works:

* My company serves as a **marketplace connecting patients with ethical dentists**.
* We build a network of vetted dentists (e.g., 10 per region) whom we target to meet our high ethical and professional standards.
* Patients can access **free or low-cost exams** (e.g., $25) that include x-rays and 3D scans.
* Dentists review the scans remotely and provide preliminary quotes, removing the pressure of making decisions while in the dental chair.

The benefits to patients include:

* Easy access to multiple second opinions (maybe 5+ opinions) without high costs.
* Transparency in pricing and treatment plans.
* A curated selection of trustworthy dentists (for example, keeping dentists out of the network, who keeps misdiagnosing or many complaints from the patients)
* Discounts for appointments during “perishable times” (e.g., last-minute openings)\*

For dentists, the platform offers:

* A new marketing channel tailored to their expertise.
* The ability to attract patients who align with their preferred treatment styles.
* A way to fill empty chair time with discounted appointments\*

My goal? I want good-good dentists to treat more patients, and less bad dentists. Allow people more access to their dental health knowledge, and provide a clear transparency in dental industries, thereby removing the concern, “all dentists are scammers”.

I’m currently testing this idea and have a patent pending. Starting a business outside the corporate world has been very challenging, but I believe this platform has the potential to bridge a significant gap in the dental industry. But I’d love to hear your thoughts—could this service make a meaningful difference in your life or the lives of others?",0,1734213646.0,AskNYC,1,0.5,False
1hedo6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1hedo6i/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

Lately, I've been exploring various espresso blends around the Seattle area, trying options from Vivace to Victrola and beyond. Many of these blends proved quite tricky to dial in, and even when I managed to get it right, they often didn’t deliver the results—or the crema—I was hoping for.

In the past, I had tried Vivace with my Breville machines, but this was my first experience using their beans with my new setup: the Eureka Mignon Libra grinder and the Lelit Mara X. And wow, what a difference! From dialing in the grind to pulling perfectly balanced shots with a rich, velvety crema, the experience was incredible.

The flavor is so well-balanced that, in milk-based drinks, it almost didn’t taste like coffee—it was that smooth! If you haven’t tried it yet, I highly recommend their *Vita* blend, crafted specifically for milk-based drinks, or the *Dolce* blend, ideal for straight espresso shots. For those curious, my grinder setting was 4 big steps away from the zero point.

Height: 5ft 11

Weight: \~145lbs 

Race: White

Primary Complaint: Around six days ago, I felt a tickle in my throat.



This has progressed. On the second day, I got laryngitis and while my voice is slightly better now, still messed up. The pain has also gotten worse, but I would only describe it as moderate. Maybe a 4 or 5 out of 10. The pain in my throat I would describe as sharp and sometimes it feels like mucus is dripping. 



From the second day onward, I would also emit the occasional cough and usually felt phlegm in my throat. Starting two days ago, I have been coughing non-stop upon lying in bed before being able to sleep despite only coughing 2-3 times per hour during the daytime. The first night of this I took only advil cold & sinus. The second I took Nyquil but it made no difference. 



The other major symptom is pressure sometimes amounting to mild pain around my ears. Maybe a 2-3 out of 10. I have had no fever. I also started 2 days ago testing positive for Covid-19, but am worried it might be strep as well. This makes me nervous as I have a flight coming up in two days. Ideally I wouldn't since it might be expensive to change it and it is to see my family who I hardly get to see, but if it is for the best, I can change it. Was considering maybe trying Afrin (oxymetazoline) and ear planes on the flight. 

  
See Image of Throat, the weird stuff on my teeth is my retainer: [https://imgur.com/a/cmWTEDK](https://imgur.com/a/cmWTEDK) I don't know why Imgur thinks it might be 18+, it is just my throat.

  
Duration: Started 6 days ago. 

  
Existing Medical Issues: Covid-19



Medications: At first I was taking Cepacol cough drops every \~2 hours with benzocaine (15mg) but stopped in the last 48 hours since I felt weirdly that they would make my throat worse and started taking just menthol cough drops or chewing mint gum. Been taking 1-2 advil cold & sinus pills every 4 hours as needed, but generally on the lower end skipping many doses (200mg ibuprofen, 30mg pseudoephedrine). Last night I tried Nyquil and was careful not to combine it with the advil cold & sinus (650mg acetaminophen, 30mg dextromethophran, 12.5mg doxylamine). 2-4 cups of coffee per day if that is relevant. 1000mg of Vitamin C, 1000 UI of Vitamin D, 10,000 UI of Vitamin A every second day. 

  
Vices: No smoking, no recreational drugs. I usually have 1-2 drinks maybe twice a week. Since getting sick though, all I have had is 1 beer with supper maybe 3 or 4 days ago.

My ex boyfriend and I dated all through college, and eventually got an apartment together. We ended up breaking up about two months after moving in together.

Looking back on it, there was a lot of emotional and verbal abuse throughout the years we were together, and sometimes things he did or said still affect me in my day to day life and current relationship. 

When we were talking about moving in together, I told him not to worry about furniture. I’d already had my own fully furnished apartment, while he’d just been living with roommates using their stuff (aside from basics like a bed/dresser/desk), so I didn’t see a need for him to buy more stuff. I argued against it, actually. When we broke up, he moved all his stuff into the second bedroom, and we slept in separate rooms. Everything he owned was in that one room. 

We were both still in college, so when winter break happened I went home to stay with my parents across the country. A family member of mine died just before Christmas and it wrecked my mental health, so I took a leave of absence from my degree and didn’t go back to the apartment. I still paid my half of the rent, though. 

Months went by and our lease was ending, so I drove back across the country to get my stuff. I got there and realized that while I was suffering and going to therapy to try to fix what he broke in me, he was fine. He’d been using my things, having his friends (who used to be *our* friends) over for parties and to hang out, playing games on my Xbox. Cooking meals with my pots and pans, eating off my plates, using my alcohol from my stash to give to his friends or whoever. I don’t know why, but I snapped. I was so angry, and was feeling used… so I took everything. All the dishes and kitchen appliances, all my furniture and rugs and decorations and curtains from the living room. It was all stuff I’d bought anyways, and I was determined to take it all. The thing I feel bad about, though, was that I didn’t need it. I didn’t even really have a place to store it at my parents house, but I just didn’t want him to have it. Nothing was expensive, or sentimental, except for my personal items in my bedroom. The couch and tables were from big lots, the dishes were from the dollar store, the TV and coffee maker were free from a friend of mine. None of it really mattered, I could have just left them, but I didn’t. It cost more money to rent a bigger u-haul than any of the furniture was actually worth. 

The only thing he had brought outside of the basics was a kitchen table and a vacuum. When I left, I set the table up in the middle of the empty room as a final “fuck you”. 

He was broke, probably still is, and wouldn’t have had the money to buy new furniture for a while. I didn’t care at the time, but I do now. It was spiteful and shitty and I did it specifically to hurt him. I wanted him to realize how much he lost when we broke up. I wanted to disrupt his life as much as he’d done to mine. I didn’t want to leave any part of myself behind for him to use. I don’t know how he felt coming back that night to an empty apartment, without any plates to even make dinner on. It used to make me feel vindicated and smug, but now it just makes me sad to think about. 

So, I’m sorry, Joe. I hope you’re doing better. ",11,1734212482.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

1hed9cg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransLater/comments/1hed9cg/fresh_scars/,Fresh Scars,"The morning begin in the same manner as every other morning, with the obnoxious melody of my alarm clock letting me know that once again it is five in the morning.  I pad my way to the kitchen, shut the alarm off and begin the process of making coffee.  As the coffee machine goes about it’s business of noisily manufacturing that caffeinated nectar that seems to serve as my life blood I start getting dressed for the morning.   Travel mug in hand, stick and equipment bag in the other, I make my way out to the truck.   It was cold last night, the windshield of the truck is covered in frost which needs to be scraped off.  Not yet Five thirty, the mornings off to a good start.  

The moon is just beginning to set on the western horizon as I park the truck and carry my gear to the edge of the pond.   We had a full moon last night, it takes on an orangish yellow glow as it sinks into the cedar trees of the ridgeline to the west.   It’s a half hour to dawn yet, but there is just enough light to sort of see what I’m doing as I lace up my skates and step onto the ice for the first time this winter. 

Those first few steps are tentative, it’s been a good half year since I’ve last skated.  I haven’t been on the pond since the warm  temperatures of last spring had claimed the ice as their victim.  It doesn’t matter how many years I’ve skated,  it still seems an incredibly perishable skill,  that first time back on the ice still comes with it’s share of uncertainty.   Do I still know where my edge are?  Do I still have the balance, the muscle memory to move efficiently on the ice, to be able to change directions at whim without the fear of failing down.   Do I still remember how to fall without getting hurt?    The certainty slowly begins to return, even if I’m horribly out of practice and out of shape. 

   The ice feels good, cold hard and fast.   The sounds the skates make as they cut in is brittle and harsh in the chilly morning air.   I’ve always enjoyed skating….enjoyed the speed, the fluidity, the changes of direction.  In some ways it’s poetry in motion, one of the activities I truly love, even if I’m only marginally talented at it. This is the carrot at the end of the stick I live for, that brief part of the year when the world finally becomes cold enough that the ice returns.

Light begins to creep into the valley and the greys begin to soften enough that it is easier to make out the puck against the ice.  At the sound of the puck hitting the ice, my dog makes an appearance; she’d been busy supervising the horses to their great annoyance.   We spend the next hour trying to play keep away from each other.  

I usually skate with a set of headphones and one of my favorite soundtracks playing in my ear.   As the amount of time I can still have on the  ice draws to a close and my fatigue level increases….I’m much less likely to skip over the slower more melancholy tunes as I make my way back and forth.   One of my favorite songs by Shine down comes on,  so much of their music  really speaks to me since I’ve begun this journey, “Symptom of being human” in particular.

“Sometimes I’m in a room and I don’t belong

And the house is on fire and there’s  no alarm,

And the walls are melting too,

How bout you?”

How many times did that seem to describe my life, that feeling of slowly suffocating inside myself…knowing that what I truly wanted, couldn’t be, and then later when I found out it maybe could be, would never be accepted by anybody I knew.  

“Unpack all your baggage,

Hide it in the attic, where,

You hope it disappears”

How many times did I think if I just tried harder, if I could just make this all go away…that maybe I could have a good life,  my family would still love me, and I could stand in front of god unashamed.  How many times did I learn to hate myself when I couldn’t make it go away.  

“This all seems so familiar, but it doesn’t feel  like home,

It’s just another unknown.”

For me that cost was learning to become numb, trying to feel the pain, but also unable to feel anything else, joy, excitement….even fear was little more than a fatalistic certaintity.

“You’ve always been slightly awkward, kinda weird,

Upside down, and not all here.

Right or wrong is all so crystal clear.”

And that’s where I am today, evidently I don’t really quite fit anybody’s mold completely.  Not my church’s mold, not the mold of the cowboy side of my family, not the mold of the farming community, the mold of the veterans I once served with,  Not even the mold of trans community I now find myself part of.  Parts fit, other’s don’t.   But I am me, part of this journey has been learning not to hate myself.  

The sunrises with its brilliant hues of pink, yellow and orange.   I’m running out of time….and energy.   I make one last pass of the ice with a snow shovel, scraping the bits of ice  thrown up by my skates to the edge of the pond.   The surface of the ice which had been pristine and unmarked this morning is now covered in covered in the tracks made by the mornings skate.   Fresh scars.

As I make my way back to the truck,  my mind drifts to a conversation I’d had with one of the guys I had served with.  I had hit him up to let him  know that one of our friends had recently been diagnosed with a brain tumor and to ask that he and his family would be praying for him.    For so many of us, we came back with an unspoken sense that we were all  living on borrowed time.  The last decade has claimed far more causualties amongst the ranks than many of us are comfortable with….cancers, suicides, substance abuse issues   It’s hard to say at this point whether or not the tumor is result of that deployment or not,  exposure to burn pits, multiple hits by ieds,  and exposure to depleted uranium are all  at play in this case.  The army hasn’t acknowledged it yet, but I maintain a set of questions regarding whether or not there were risks to spending so much time with in mere feet of the warlock antennaes meant to prevent IED’s from exploding.  Of course on the other hand….it might not be service related….We live in a world where cancer happens and our normal everyday lives are filled with exposure to things that aren’t necessarily good for us.   Still all the same, it’s so frustrating to keep seeing friends struggle long after we made it home,  and most of them, you don’t know it till they can’t hide it anymore.  C’est la vie. 

Somewhere in that conversation, my friend asked how I was doing.   I gave my usual…”I’ve  chosen to walk some hard paths in life, I live with the consequences.”  It’s just enough of an awkward answer that I’m usually spared having to explain exactly what it means .   I’m not sure I’m prepared to answer in the event someone ever asks me to elaborate.   In some ways my life is a train wreck,  full of the heartache caused when I chose to come out to my fiancé….the departure that still leaves an incredible aching void, the sadness of watching friends and peers raise families of their own, knowing that for me that will never be an experience I’ll know…...    I’m not really ready to try to explain that.  I ’m not out to those I served with, and fairly sure that when it becomes known, it’ll probably go over like a lead balloon.

His answer sort of surprised me.  “You know….we all end up the  same place.”

“You mean we’re all gonna die someday?” 

“Yup”  

And he’s right…..none of us make it off this rock alive.   We’re all gonna  end up with two dates marked on our stones……the real question is what we do with that little dash in between.   I’ve spent so much of my life simply going through the motions trying to be what everybody else wanted me to be.   All the while slowly dying inside,  numb and deeply unhappy.  Life is far too damn short not to enjoy,  its sentence  far too damn long if you don’t.  

Mess and all, I’m learning to live, it took me forty years to get here,   Who knows how many I’ve got left….but I’m grateful for each day I get.  

“Upside down, not all here, Right or wrong is all so clear”

What I got left….even if it don’t fit nobodies mold….I’m gonna be me.  “I aim to misbehave.”

The Sabrina Carpenter Me Espresso review no one asked for -- from a mid-30s data analyst shut-in who loves light musks, earthy, and woody notes, but got high on Nyquil last Sunday and ordered Me Espresso while sick and crying in bed. As a disclaimer, I am not a gourmand girly. The closest I come to gourmand is probably Mon Guerlain or Eau Duelle, so I do not have a refined nose for luscious gourmands. I have been on a hunt for my perfect coffee/espresso scent for a long time though, and in a drugged up haze, this seemed like a good idea.

So, onto the fragrance itself (and its packaging). Someone suggested that the juice smelled like grape soda, which honestly had me curious. I am sad to report that it does not smell of grape soda, but the box sort of does? Which is...weird.

After the first spray on my arm, I immediately smell Captain Crunch (the underwhelming yellow-y beige bits, not the berries), which morphs quickly into a sweet, faux-chocolate-y whipped cream smell that then itself cedes space to a barrage of white flowers - primarily jasmine and orchid. I do not smell any coffee, I do not smell any real deep vanilla, I only get sweet creamy chaos and jasmine/orchid. The dry down is much the same, and eventually I just smell like I washed my hands with a creamy jasmine Dial soap if I lean close to  my arm. While it's present, though, the sweet creamy whatever-it-is is at war with the jasmine/orchid. The blending of those two sets of notes just is not great. 

Again, I am not a gourmand lover and I might just be missing something nuanced that most gourmand-y folks would appreciate more. Maybe there is an order in that sweet chaos that is eluding me. I am, however, a fan of white flowers. I love some dominant white florals like Olene, which is essentially just a jasmine-honeysuckle bomb. But this white flower combo smells off, possibly because of the discordance of the creamy notes.

As an aside, if anyone has any suggestions for actual coffee scents I may not have heard of, please drop them here! Based on previous coffee threads, I already crossed off Akro - Awake, Kerosene - Follow and Followed (ugh), Mancera - Amore Caffe, Montale - Intense Cafe (I need to try Ristretto Intense Cafe), Replica - Coffee Break, and Theodoros Kalotinis - Coffee Addict. Follow and Awake were closest to what I wanted, but didn't quite hit the level I was hoping for. Intense Cafe was a similar vibe to Me Espresso, where the coffee ceded to floral notes. Except Intense Cafe is a lovely rose scent and the coffee is actually discernible, but secondary.

Anyway, now I have a Carolina Blue plastic chocolate bar paper weight 🙃 Buy with caution.

There have been dozens and probably hundreds of restaurants that try the ""you don't have to tip here"" model. And every time this happens many diners tip anyway. Are you going to tell servers they have to refuse the money?

What happens is that that $20 meal goes up to $24. Customers see higher prices — even after subtracting tips in their mind — and eat elsewhere. Servers realize they make less. Restaurants realize that paying a better wage makes the servers earn LESS money. Servers know they can make better money elsewhere... And do so.

Now, I get that tipping is out of hand. If you're not sitting down at a restaurant, tipping is very optional. The $0.50 change from a $3.50 coffee is fine... Or $0. Throwing a dollar or 2 to the guys getting your carryout together is optional. But for the typical dining experience, either tip, or don't go out to eat in America.

1hed4uh,https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/1hed4uh/the_inefficiency_of_trade_analyzed/,"The (in)efficiency of Trade, analyzed","I wanted to know how much trade can influence market price. For example, if my trade partner has a goods at base price, how close can I get to base price by trading with them.

First, let's establish how trade routes work. A trade route buys a certain amount of goods from one market to sell in another market. The total revenue is the price difference multiplied by the amount of goods traded. The productivity is the total revenue, subtracted by tariffs, per employee annually.

Trade routes level up when the predicted revenue (price difference multiplied by volume) per employee is at least than £10 after tariffs. We can therefore calculate the price difference before a trade route falls below the minimum productivity of £10.

The number of employees varies based on the trade center's PM, which is in turn determined by your laws. All trade centers employ 250 clerks, then an option between 250 shopkeepers under Mercantilism, 100 bureaucrats under Command Economy / Cooperative Ownership, or 50 capitalists otherwise. Mercantilism requires 2/3 more employees compared to Protectionism, and proportionally larger revenue and price difference.

Another factor is economy of scale. Each level of trade route adds 25% volume per level, up to **11 times** at 41 levels. In other words, a level 1 trade route would need 11/1.25 = 8.8 times the price difference to level up compared to a level 41 one. Trade volume modifiers from Free Trade and Trade League bloc applies too.

Lastly, we need to take into consideration each good's trade quantity - how much volume a level 1 trade center can transport, as well as their base prices. Higher is better, not much to say here.

With all that said, here is a spreadsheet of how efficient trade is with protectionism and no economy of scale:

|Goods|Min Price Difference|Volume to reach Level 41|

|wood|28.85%|4510|
|manowars|32.97%|1127.5|

To adjust the number to your specific situation:

* Multiply by 1.67 if under Mercantilism, or 1.167 if under Command Economy / Cooperative Ownership
* Divide by 1.5 if under Free Trade
* Divide by up to 11 to account for economy of scale
* Add tariff, if any. (Tariffs apply to base price.)

I think the main takeaway is that economy of scale is really powerful when it comes to trade. Realistically you can get to 20 levels trading with great powers and only have 1/5 the listed price difference. Don't expect trade to do much for smaller economies since the volume is too low to scale. The first few levels are dreadfully inefficient.

Mercantilism is secretly a 40% trade volume penalty. Switch to a better law when you can.",3,1734212104.0,victoria3,0,1.0,False

Before we start, I should clarify that I'm, of course, not encouraging using of these methods. The post is more about curiosity, not actually asking advice on doing unhealthy things.

18 y.o. MtF, 180 cm height, 92 kg weight.

Hi everybody! So, my problem is that I cannot maintain calorie deficiency no matter what I try.

I'm really addicted to compulsively eating sweets. I would even call this addiction crippling. The problem is that I live with my family and my family members eat a lot of sweets. Most of the time we have some sweets at home, so I just slowly eat them one-by-one until they end. I have zero control over this shit.

That being said, any attempts to maintain calorie deficiency break against this compulsive overeating. At the late evening I'm still 200-300 calories below my balance, but then I find sweets somewhere at home and when I go to sleep, I'm already at or even slightly above the line.

I was really sad about this fact for a while, but recently I got an idea. What if I use unhealthy method (amphetamine, coffee and water only) for some time, lose my 20 kg and then continue to live like nothing happened? I will weight 70 kg, consume the same amount of calories I burn and don't have any problems with weight.

","Hey guys, I (m33) need some advice. My girl (f25) is wonderful, doesn’t like to drink, dresses conservatively, faithful, trustworthy etc. She’s everything I want in a woman and has never given me reason to doubt her. We’ve been in a relationship ship for about 2 years now and I plan on marrying her. 

She works at a coffee shop with younger women and men between 20-23 years old. They all like to get together and drink 2 to 3 nights a week. My girl struggles because she wants to partake in the activities with her friends, not necessarily the drinking (she barely drinks) and today she wanted to go to a college party that one of her coworkers invited her to. This is a problem for me, not because I don’t trust her, but because I don’t trust others (and have been burnt by this behavior before in past relationships). 

That, and my other problem is I don’t have much extra time to go do these things 2 to 3 nights a week with her (which she always asks me to go with). How do I communicate to her that I’m willing to do these things occasionally, but have bigger goals and priorities in my career and our lives? 

Additionally, I think it takes away from the responsibilities that we both have. Keeping the house clean, taking care of the dog and cat, her studying for massage school, etc. Instead, our responsibilities fall to the side in exchange for fun, spending, etc. 

How do I lead her in a better direction without being a jerk? I’m starting to get overwhelmed by taking care of both of our responsibilities, the finances, my businesses, fun, experiences, seeing her friends, my family etc. There seems to never be enough time and I’m feeling like I’m spending too much doing fun things rather than things I need to do.

My husband had a major health scare last month and was in ICU for few days.I handled everything on my own and took a little help from husband's friends. After coming back from hospital I told my close friends about  what had happened and that recovery will take a month or so. All of them asked me why I didn't reach out when I was in hospital. I told themI I was able to manage everything. All of them told me to reach out to them if I need anything. ( all good till now) O

While talking to one of these friends, Itoldt her I don't want to talk about this right now. 3-4 days after this she messaged to ask how things were and Itoldt her how the recovery was going.Thent she disappeared for 20 days. No call or message to ask about us. Later she messaged and asked about things and how I am doing in the middle of all this. ( I have anxiety and depression) She didn't call even once and didn't check on us for almost a month but told me how I need to share things and not close off. Later she told me she was not able to check on me because their child was having fever and she didn't call me because she didn't want to cross any boundary. 

I considered her a very close friend. I always messaged and called her regularly. Asked her out for coffee and lunch. ( she doesn't have friends in this city apart from me and coupleofo others) . Whenever she was not feeling good mentally, I went to her house to meet and cheer her up. When her family was falling sick again and again, I went with medicines. Baked for them oftenandm did more things like that. I did all that as I considered her a very good friend and she also told meIa very important for her. 

For the first time ever in our friendship, I wanted to be on the receiving end. And when I didn't even get a message ( forget call), I felt hurt and betrayed. I also decided to draw a boundary and not go above and beyond for her and others as when I needed it, nobody came to help me.  I didn't want to discuss this with her but somehow the conversation came and nowt she is telling me that I was overthinking everything and I should be the same old friend to thema. But I can't do it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many people dream of a bright, white smile. This is where teeth whitening comes in. The transformative effects of teeth whitening can be overwhelming, both in physical appearance and in how it boosts confidence. You might be wondering what the **before and after** experience is like. Let’s explore what happens when you decide to brighten your smile.

Teeth whitening treatments come in various forms, including professional dentist services and at-home kits. Each option offers unique benefits but leads to the same goal: a brighter smile. Before you start, it’s essential to know the state of your teeth. This can help set realistic expectations.

### The Before: Understanding Your Current Smile

Before teeth whitening, you may notice certain factors affecting your smile:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Stains:** These can come from food, drinks, or habits like smoking.
- **Natural Color:** Everyone’s teeth have a natural shade, which can range from bright white to more yellow hues.
- **Dental Health:** Healthy gums and teeth are crucial before proceeding. Issues like cavities or gum disease should be treated first.
- **Expectations:** Knowing what you want to achieve can guide your choice of treatment.

Taking a photo of your teeth before starting the whitening process can provide a useful reference for results. You can look back and compare the changes after the treatment is complete.

### The During: Choosing Your Method

Once you are ready, selecting the right whitening method is key. Here are a few options:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Professional Whitening:** This method is done at a dental office and usually involves stronger bleaching agents. You can see immediate results.
- **At-Home Kits:** These kits often include whitening strips or gels. They are more flexible but may take longer to show results.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** While gentle, these can help maintain your brightness between treatments.

Each method has its timeline and results. Understanding how and when to apply your chosen treatment can affect your whitening journey. While using any product, be sure to follow instructions carefully for the best results.

### The After: Witnessing the Difference

After completing a whitening treatment, you may experience immediate changes:

- **Improved Aesthetics:** Your teeth can appear significantly whiter, enhancing your overall look.
- **Boost in Confidence:** Many users report feeling more self-assured and willing to smile openly.
- **Change in Habits:** Post-whitening, you might become more mindful of your dietary choices, opting for less stain-causing foods.

Additionally, documenting your results with after photos can be a motivating factor. Comparing the **before and after** images can visually showcase your progress and make you proud of your commitment to dental care.

### Maintaining Your Bright Smile

Once you achieve the desired brightness, keeping your smile looking its best is important. Here are a few tips:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Regular Dental Check-ups:** Always consult your dentist about your whitening experiences and maintain oral health.
- **Maintain Good Hygiene:** Brush and floss regularly to keep your smile bright.
- **Avoid Staining Foods:** Cut back on coffee, tea, and red wine to protect your newly whitened teeth.

The journey of teeth whitening is not just about aesthetics; it often leads to a change in lifestyle and increased self-esteem. So, if you are contemplating teeth whitening, remember that the **before and after** effects can be life-changing.

A bright smile can open doors, allowing you to engage more confidently in social and professional environments. With careful consideration and follow-up care, you can enjoy a smile that reflects your true self.

Choosing the Right Teeth Whitening Method for Optimal Results
-------------------------------------------------------------

Having a bright, white smile can boost your confidence and make a lasting impression. However, choosing the right teeth whitening method can be overwhelming with all the options available. It’s essential to understand your needs and the potential results of each method for optimal outcomes. Let's explore various teeth whitening techniques, their benefits, and important considerations.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### In-Office Whitening Treatments

One of the most effective teeth whitening options is professional in-office treatments. These procedures are typically performed by dental professionals and use stronger whitening agents compared to at-home options.

- **Advantages:**
    - Fast and noticeable results.
    - Safe application managed by a professional.
    - Customizable based on your specific needs.
- **Considerations:**
    - Higher cost than over-the-counter methods.
    - May require multiple visits to achieve desired results.
    - Possible sensitivity after treatment.

### At-Home Whitening Kits

If you prefer a more budget-friendly option, at-home whitening kits are widely available. These typically come in forms like strips, gels, or trays and contain peroxide-based whitening agents.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Advantages:**
    - More affordable than professional treatments.
    - Convenience of whitening at your own pace.
    - Variety of products to suit individual preferences.
- **Considerations:**
    - Results may take longer to achieve.
    - Consistency in application is key for best results.
    - Some products may cause tooth sensitivity.

### Whitening Toothpaste

Whitening toothpaste is a great option for those looking to maintain brightness between more intensive whitening treatments. These pastes often contain mild abrasives and chemical agents that help remove surface stains.

- **Advantages:**
    - Easy to incorporate into your daily routine.
    - Generally safe for everyday use.
- **Considerations:**
    - Results are usually subtle and gradual.
    - May not be effective for deeper stains.

### Natural Whitening Remedies

Some people prefer natural methods for teeth whitening due to the avoidance of chemicals. Popular options include baking soda, activated charcoal, and certain fruits like strawberries.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Advantages:**
    - Cost-effective and accessible ingredients.
    - Less risk of chemical sensitivity.
- **Considerations:**
    - Results can vary greatly and may take longer.
    - Potential for enamel erosion if used excessively.

### Choosing the Right Method for You

Now that we’ve reviewed various teeth whitening options, how do you decide which method is best for you? Here are some simple steps to guide your decision:

1. **Evaluate your teeth:** Consider the current shade and health of your teeth. Are there any existing dental issues?
2. **Set a budget:** Determine how much you are willing to spend on whitening treatments.
3. **Consider your time:** How quickly do you want to see results? Professional treatments offer faster results.
4. **Check for sensitivity:** If you have sensitive teeth, consult with your dentist to find the safest option for you.

Whichever method you choose, consistency is key. Maintaining your oral hygiene routine, visiting your dentist regularly, and being mindful of staining foods and drinks will help keep your smile bright. With the right teeth whitening method, you’ll be on your way to a dazzling smile that enhances your confidence and well-being.

### Conclusion

The journey to a brighter smile can be truly remarkable. When you look at the transformative effects of teeth whitening, the contrast between before and after can be astounding. Many individuals find that a whiter smile enhances their confidence and boosts their overall self-esteem. It's not just about aesthetics; it's about how you feel when you smile.

1hecvsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hecvsz/tales_from_the_terran_republic_vikkart/,[Tales From the Terran Republic] Vikkart,"Sorry for the delay, I was enjoying a seven day vacation from Reddit.

You will be amazed what upsets some people. 

Oh, well, I wonder what Vikkart is up to.

\*\*\*

Vikkart walked hand in hand with Maatisha through Kaath Park as bright purple Laavash blossoms fell around them.

She looked up at him with adoring eyes as he leaned in to touch his nose to hers…

“Darling, it’s time to wake…”

He struggled to hang on to the image for just one moment longer.

“It’s time to awaken, my love.”

He reluctantly awoke and turned to the hologram of his beloved Maatisha hovering over a digital clock.

He really had to get up.

Sighing, he got out of his small bed and off of the thin but surprisingly comfortable mattress and folded the bed up against the polymer wall of the “cube” he now rented in lieu of his fashionable downtown flat.

It was tiny, he could almost reach out and touch both sides at once, but it was very well designed. No square inch was wasted. He then went to the sink/shower/toilet combo in one corner and took his morning poop and a quick shower, the water flowing down the hydrophobic walls and floor that covered the entire cube and down the drain.

It was surprisingly convenient. Any spills anywhere just disappeared, and keeping the place clean was a breeze.

He wondered why all dwellings weren’t made this way. It was, by definition, not expensive.

He took a few steps to the tiny but efficient kitchenette, folded down a table from the wall, pulled out his only bowl, and opened a cracked crockery canister he got at a nearby “carpet market” where people sold this and that while sitting on carpets with their wares. At least they did when it got its name. Now, they usually had folding tables.

He then placed a blender obtained from the same market and filled it with three different grains and pieces of a dehydrated vegetable, the traditional “four pillars” of the Garthran diet. Those four things alone were sufficient to keep a Garthra alive and reasonably healthy. He then carefully measured a little cupful of powdered milk from a cardboard box and then added a very precisely leveled spoonful of a dark powder, instant glooa, Garthran “coffee,” and filled the rest of the blender with water.

His trusty blender quickly turned the contents into “harvest milk,” a traditional beverage used by farmers when, well, harvesting. He got the recipe from OurVision, their YouTube. (He added the instant glooa as a little modification and one of his few indulgences).

He then poured a measure of it over his cereal and, standing at the table, munched happily as he pressed an icon on his phone.

A holographic projector built into the cube (for free!) projected a room-sized screen that was automatically oriented to face him. Why did those fancy places he used to live bother with those fancy screens? This was much better.

He thoroughly enjoyed his breakfast with a glass filled with the rest of the harvest milk as he paid close attention to the local and business news. It wasn’t really part of his job, but it never hurt to be well-informed.

His coworkers certainly would be, and he didn’t want to be left out or caught wanting… again.

There was another local shooting. It wasn’t in his current neighborhood, which would surprise many. It was from an upper-class entertainment district. It arose from an argument concerning an unknowingly shared mistress after one too many drinks at an upscale bar.

He snorted. He halfway knew the people involved. Neither deserved sympathy.

They were nearly as awful as he once was.

A paralyzing amount of cringe and genuine regret momentarily consumed him. By the heavenly stream, he was awful.

He shook it off. He had to get ready.

He finished his breakfast and packed his lunch into a used and somewhat dented but still perfectly usable lunch box. He opened the little mini fridge and filled it half full with steamed four pillars and the other half with sliced marnook, an inexpensive leafy vegetable made even cheaper by it being in season. He doused it with kaan, a type of vinegar. He then topped the entire box with bargaa seeds and small dehydrated “minnows.”

Between now and lunch, the vinegar would soak into the marnook, softening it slightly and making a nice “slaw,” the cold four pillars would naturally warm to a much more palatable room temperature, and the minnows would soak up the juices from the marnook and the vinegar and become quite tasty.

He smiled. For just a couple of credits, he had quite the feast lined up. He wished he could top it with a little oil, but he was out and needed to wait until his next payday to stock up. He wondered if he could trade for a little voosh grease from a neighbor or something.

He liked voosh grease. It made everything better. He wondered how he ever got by without it.

Too bad he couldn’t afford voosh right now, but it was a small price for Maatisha’s safety and comfort. Her comfort was more important than his.

He could choose how much he had to endure. She couldn’t.

Besides, he really didn’t have to “endure” much. He had come to like his little cube and his way of living. If anything, he was living better than he ever did before. His diet was much healthier, and having to walk to work had burned away the corpulence and poison from his wasted former life. Well, walking to the bus stop, then the train terminal, and then to his workplace.

He didn’t mind. The walk was pleasant, and the bus and train rides were his time that he could use to read, watch media, or write to Maatisha. Emails were much cheaper than the holo-calls that constantly drained what little extra money he had.

He made his way out of the building, taking time to greet his neighbors, who were exclusively stripes. His blonde coworkers wouldn’t be caught dead in this neighborhood.

More precisely, they could be very well caught dead around here. At least, they thought they could be. Nothing could be farther from the truth.

The dangerous area was several streets away. You didn’t want to go *there* (unless you wanted a prostitute, drugs, or a gun). Where he lived was a nice working-class neighbourhood that didn’t put up with that nonsense. Just as a blonde feared they would be caught dead here, a troublemaker from “the bleak” *knew* they would be caught dead if they started problems in the cubes.

In some ways, it was the nicest place he ever lived. There were loads of local and very inexpensive shops, carpet markets, little open space recreation areas, and lovely (and some not so lovely) art spray painted on the walls.

He even learned to play hoopstick, albeit rather badly. It was fun, though, and most importantly, free. You just needed a stick and a ball.

He also thought he knew how to play kangrel, a traditional board game. As it turns out, he, in fact, did not.

Down in the park, he was eaten alive, even by children. But, again, it was free. You just needed a pouch of game pieces. (He got a lovely old set from the carpet market.) The boards were etched into the park tables, sometimes by design, sometimes by hand. How ingenious was that?

Walking towards the bus stop, he grinned as people bobbed and bowed to him as if he were nobility. Laughing, he would give them “the wave” as they laughed back.

Being a “stripeless stripe” made him a local celebrity of sorts. However, it was all in good fun.

He was also a celebrity for another reason. Yes. He was “that one.” Everybody on the whole freaking planet knew about “that one.” When pressed, he always responded with, “Let’s have your cluster twisted to the point of bursting and see how you fare. I needed medical attention, for mud’s sake.”

That never failed to get a laugh. He was surprised to find that he liked making people laugh, even at his own expense.

It sounded like the baroness was doing quite well, though. Good for her. She had truly carved out a place for herself.

He smiled.

In a much more meager fashion, so had he. Here, he and Maatisha would be able to live no matter what. It may be tiny, both in size and in prospects, but his place was safe, secure, and surprisingly comfortable.

At the bus stop, he smiled and chatted with his fellow commuters. There was a newcomer who was visiting family. He smiled gamely at the questions, the same questions people always had down here. However, they were far more interested in the baroness than he. He had to disappoint them. His association with the baroness was quite brief, as eventful as it was, and he didn’t know her before their “courtship.”

On the trip to his workplace, he was delighted to find another email from Maatisha! His morning was officially made. As always, they were bittersweet. The more she insisted that she was well, the more he doubted it.

He saw the bruises. Outraged, he took up the issue with that bitch of a gangster. All she said about it was, “Accidents happen.” When pressed, she just smiled and said that Maatisha had “accidentally pissed her off” and suggested that a few thousand would certainly erase any hard feelings.

Once again, what he had managed to save to make the slightest dent in Maatisha’s debt was gone.

However, Maatisha was safe, and the bruises faded. More importantly, they weren’t refreshed.

He couldn’t let himself lose hope, though. He had to remain strong... for her.

As he left the final subway and made his way to his father’s towering building. He had to, once again, run what his coworkers had dubbed “the pinch,” referring to the choke points built into their ancient fortifications.

The other greys sneered and made little cutting remarks as he passed. He long since stopped caring. Why should he? They didn’t know.

They didn’t know why he did all of this. They were so lost they wouldn’t understand even if they did.

They also didn’t know how little he thought of them and their opinion these days. The only opinions he cared about were his coworkers, his neighbours...

...and, of course, her.

The greys were faceless and, for the most part, nameless. They were worth less than the rubbish in the street as far as he was concerned.

The taunting continued in the lobby of his father’s building, but not by all. The more senior among their ranks were strangely polite, almost as if they knew something the cubs did not. Where the “cubs” made caustic remarks, they only smirked...

...and it wasn’t at Vikkart.

Vikkart smiled and smiled at his watch, a cheap plastic credit store special (he sold his fancy one long ago). He had a little time to pause at the fountain. He liked the fountain.

He sat and penned a love letter to Maatisha until it was... oops... five minutes later than it should have been.

The lobby was nearly empty as he rushed to the elevator.

It was empty.

“Hold the door!” a feminine voice called out, and his blood ran cold. It was Varkshaa, or “The Fangs” if she was out of earshot, a very high-level executive. Her nickname was due to her elaborately carved and embellished teeth, which were quite the fashionable accessory back in her day. Now, they serve as a cautionary tale about permanent “fashionable” body modifications.

Jewelled teeth hadn’t been fashionable for forty years.

She had never gotten hers removed, though. She said that it was because her teeth were too damaged. However, it was rumoured (in private) that it was because she just liked them.

They weren’t fashionable anymore, but they were certainly intimidating.

“Intimidating” was sort of her thing. Even her superiors kept clear of her.

“Young Vikkart,” she smiled. “It has been quite a while since I’ve seen you in the fur.”

“Likewise, Varkshaa,” Vikkart replied smoothly, reminding himself that the old viper could smell fear.

“It must be nice,” she smiled, flashing those disturbing teeth.

“You have me at a disadvantage,” he replied, “What is nice?”

“Business casual,” she said as she gestured toward him.

Ah, more teasing. At least she had class.

“It most certainly is,” Vikkart replied. “It is quite freeing, not to mention every bit as comfortable as it looks.”

“And it shows you off nicely,” she said, eyeing him up and down. “I had no idea all of that... that... was hiding under all of your blubber.”

“Neither did I,” he smiled, refusing to be rattled. To be honest, he would much rather be trapped in that elevator with a viper. It would be safer.

“I wonder if your father is hiding something similar,” she smiled widely, her delicately embellished teeth gleaming wickedly, “I might just have to do a ‘hostile takeover’ and work the fat off of him.”

“I thank you on my mother’s behalf and wish you good fortune,” Vikkart replied with a smirk.

Varkshaa cough chortled, shooting a small gobbet of snot out like a cannon, hitting Vikkart square in the chest.

“Oh, you have grown up, haven’t you?” she chuckled as she withdrew her handkerchief and cleaned his shirt in a slightly lascivious manner. “Those blondes have rubbed off on you.”

She grinned slyly.

“Speaking of rubbings, have any of them offered any? I hear that some of them have a taste for silver.”

“I would thank you not to cast such dispersions about my department. They are nothing but professional,” he said, “Besides, my heart belongs to another.”

Varkshaa’s wicked smile grew serious.

“Vikkart,” she said, laying her hand gently on his shoulder, “About her. Have you managed to actually verify...”

The elevator chimed, and the door opened.

“Looks like it’s my stop,” he said coldly as he lifted her hand from his shoulder. “Enjoy your trip skyward,” he added with a definite “blonde” snippiness and then walked away.

Varkshaa just sighed and shrugged.

“I hope I’m wrong. I really do,” she said to nobody once the doors closed.

\*\*\*

Later that day, a group of blondes clustered around the kettle, as was their habit.

“You gave Vikkart another sweet bun today,” Loaoo said to Keelii.

“Oooo!” the group crooned.

“It’s not like that!” Keelii said. “I just... I don’t know... He just seems so sad.”

“Sounds like you want to cheer him up, huh” Greetah snickered as she parted Keelii’s fur.

“Hey!” Keelii exclaimed, “What was that?”

“Just checking your skin in case it was starting to turn blue.”

“Oh, go jump in a lake,” Keelii snapped.

Everyone laughed as Keelii bristled... and blushed.

“Well, I have to say he’s filling out quite nicely,” an older blonde mused. “I might have to lick that spoon myself.”

“Moortisha!”

“What?” she snickered, “It’s not like you weren’t thinking it.”

“I was not!” Keelii snapped.

“Your nose betrays you,” Moortisha snerked. “That nose wants a sniff and not of your tea.”

“It’s not like it matters anyway,” Keelii grumbled, her arms crossed, “Maatisha... Maatisha... Maatisha... Humph.”

“So you do want to lick the punchbowl!” Moortisha grinned. “But can you blame him? You’ve seen the pics. That is one shiny little locket if I ever saw one.”

Vikkart approached, mug in hand. The tea there was complimentary, and he was all about free these days.

The group fell mostly silent at his approach (with some giggling).

“So, what, or who are we talking about?” he asked with a smile as he filled his mug and selected his tea.

“Just baking,” Moortisha replied. “We were just asking Keelii about her sweet little buns,” she said causing more giggling and Keelii’s nose to turn nearly purple.

Moortisha grinned.

“So, Vikkart,” she smiled, “Do you like Keelii’s buns?”

“I adore them!” Vikkart replied innocently, “Her approach with those fragrant delights truly brighten my...”

He looked with confusion at the now spasming assembly and Keelii’s practically glowing nose.

“Okay,” he sighed, “What did I say this time?”

Blonde and grey culture (and idioms) were vastly different. Whatever could buns mean besides...

Suddenly, shouting and screeching filled the cubicle farm that they all shared.

A grey was waving around a tablet and yelling at young Teegla, the most junior in the department, even greener than Vikkart (if a bit more qualified).

The blondes around him flattened their ears and hissed quietly, glaring at the intruder. However, Vikkart, no matter how humbled, was still grey. This other grey just invaded his home and was attacking one of his people, their youngling at that.

“Oh, HELL no,” he said as he set his mug beside the kettle.

“Ladies,” he said, “We shall discuss Keelii’s buns at another time. Excuse me for just a moment.”

With that, Vikkart calmly started walking towards the disturbance, leaving wide eyes and hushed whispers behind him.

“What is going on?” the manager demanded.

“What’s going on?!?” the grey shouted, “This... vermin... sabotaged my budget, that’s what! I want her fired!”

“I will investigate this,” the manager said wearily, “and will take it up with her if necessary.”

“Oh, you will do more than that!” the grey shouted, “Do you realize how much money this thing has cost us?”

“Probably not one credit,” Vikkart said as he walked up.

“You keep out of this, trash pelt!” the grey shouted.

“My pelt notwithstanding,” Vikkart said, “I know this department, and I know that report. It does have her name on it as the initial scribe. It also has the names of her mentor and the manager who I know reviewed it personally because he used it to teach me a certain macro. So, if someone is incompetent, it would be him.”

Vikkart stepped forward far too close to the other grey.

“Are you seriously implying that our manager, a man who has been here since before you were the ejaculation your mother should have swallowed, got it wrong so badly? Are you saying that an entire department far more qualified than you will ever be somehow erred to such an extent?”

Vikkart sneered at the intruder.

“This department does not make mistakes. That we leave to you.”

“Well...” the grey spluttered and then turned his anger towards Vikkart.

“What do you know?” he snarled. “You are just down here because you are so much of a waste that your own father wouldn’t even let you manage a water cooler!”

“As well he shouldn’t,” Vikkart replied with a shrug, “That much is clear. What is not clear is why you have your position. Wabaan, is it?”

“What does that have to do with anything?”

“It means that you are the last person to talk about nepotism,” Vikkart said as the entire department crowded around them.

Vikkart snatched the tablet from Wabaan’s hands.

“Now let’s see here...” Vikkart said.

“Give that back!” Wabaan shouted as he lunged at Vikkart, who turned away from him sharply, elbowing Wabaan in the process.

“That is an assault of a superior!” Wabaan shouted as the older blondes started shooing everyone back a few paces.

“Oh, I see where you fucked up,” Vikkart sneered as he tossed the tablet to the ground in front of Wabaan. “It isn’t due to our data, and coming down here like the piss-soaked snotling you are won’t provide you a swimming buddy. You are taking the plunge over this one, dude.”

“How DARE you!” Wabaan shouted, “I can have you fired, you... you... waste of a grey pelt!”

The room gasped and fell silent.

“Yeah, I said it!” Wabaan yelled, “Daddy’s little bitch! You are only down here because no grey will touch you. Maybe one of these blondes will!”

“Incorrect on two points,” Vikkart said coldly. “One, nobody here is going to ‘touch’ me. We are professionals down here and don’t carry around like you upstairs, spreading and bending for just the promise of a future promotion.”

Vikkart then walked towards a nearby cubicle.

“And as far as you getting me fired,” Vikkart snarled, “My position is far more secure than yours, secured by my holdings. In fact, I can take this very uncomfortable stool and beat you within an inch of your life and still clock in tomorrow.”

“You? Ha!” Wabaan laughed, “Daddy’s little bitch wouldn’t have the—“

\*\*\*

Vikkart, holding a wad of paper towels over his split lip, stood anxiously on the carpet in front of his father’s desk, staring at the back of his chair as his father looked out the window.

“I just got the most curious email from Caabark, he said. It contained a most interesting file from the security cameras on your floor.”

His father turned his chair to face his son.

“Would you like to see it?”

“I... Um... I was there...” Vikkart said weakly.

“You certainly were,” his father snickered as he got up and walked to his liquor cabinet...

...and pulled out two glasses.

He poured a measure into both and handed one to a very confused Vikkart.

His father was smiling.

“I find that the burn of a fine fanneel is the perfect pairing for a bleeding mouth. Let’s take a look...”

He pulled Vikkart’s hand with the paper towel away.

“His uncle will be pleased that the snotling got at least one good shot in before you sent him to the emergency room,” he laughed. “Drink up.”

Vikkart drank, trying very hard not to wince. Hard liquor and cuts do not mix well.

His father smiled at the traces of blood on his son’s glass.

“Am I getting fired?” Vikkart wailed no longer able to stand the pressure, “Please don’t fire me! I need this job! Please!”

“Fire you?” his father laughed. “Just when you rise in my estimation, you go and prove yourself a fool once more.”

“Father?”

“That snotling went down where he didn’t belong and started stirring up the blondes. Worse, he targeted the newest and weakest of the bunch. They couldn’t tread him underfoot like he deserved, but you could. That grey pelt of yours isn’t wasted. You put it to good use.”

His father drained his drink and refilled both of their glasses.

“If you hadn’t made his face the shape of a stool, do you know what would have happened?”

“The blondes would have been angry?”

“Ex fucking actly!” his father replied empathically. “And it wouldn’t have been just that floor, especially if that dipsnout pressed for a termination, which he most certainly would. You should know by now who actually runs this outfit, right?”

“The blondes?”

“Got it the first time,” his father smiled. “You haven’t seen a blonde revolt, and I hope you never do. They don’t agitate or slow down like the stripes. They quit... permanently. Every single one of your coworkers can get a job somewhere else within a month, two at most. Imagine if your department was cut by twenty-five percent, and then that twenty-five percent started calling their friends with offers from their new firm? I’ve weathered it once and hope to never do it again. This company could have bled worse than that snotling’s face when we piled him into the ambulance.”

His father laughed.

“And don’t worry about criminal charges,” he said. “As far as the police go, this is ‘just one of those grey things,’ and they couldn’t care less. More importantly, his uncle considers the whole affair as doing his idiot nephew and this whole company a favor. He’s passing around the video more than anyone.”

He clapped his son on the shoulder, causing Vikkart to reflexively flinch.

“And word is indeed spreading through the blonde horde,” his father said. “Many a mug around many a kettle is being raised in your honor during yet another of their unauthorized breaks,” he added with a chuckle. “In fact, most of the dripping building is on one of those right now.”

He shrugged.

“Meh, they will get back to work sooner or later. Rule number one of management,” he said, “Don’t piss off the blondes. And you, my son, have quite the way with them it seems.”

“I don’t know about that,” Vikkart replied weakly.

“You honestly think we don’t have snitches all over the building?” his father laughed. “By an overwhelming majority, you are considered ‘the only grey pelt in the building worth a fuck.’ That alone guarantees your continued employment. It would be suicidal to fire you.”

He looked at his son appraisingly.

“You were officially sent down there to ‘learn the business.’ But we both know it was to run you off. But did you? Did you learn the business?”

“Creators, no!” Vikkart laughed despite himself. “I can barely craft a decent report. I don’t even know how to make a spreadsheet. I can only use canned forms, and I can scarcely do that.”

“So, what was wrong with the bloody snotling’s budget?”

Vikkart huffed dismissively.

“Damned idiot just blindly copy-pasted the data from our report into last year’s formulas. That worked just fine until this year. It would be off by a little either way but within the acceptable error thresholds and it would probably be better than that moron trying to do it himself.”

“Why?”

“Shipping costs have risen over one hundred and fifty percent, thanks to the thrice-damned Forsaken. His budget failed to include that little detail. I mean, how stupid can you be? Not to mention the...”

His father just smiled and sipped his drink, only occasionally interrupting to ask a few questions every now and then.

“You can stop talking now,” he said.

“Father?”

“I’ve made my decision.”

“Your... decision?”

“The snotling is getting ‘archived’ over this one. Both his budget and him stirring up trouble downstairs was the last mote. This wasn’t his first screw-up.”

Vikkart shuddered. Being archived was the grey’s version of getting fired. It was worse than getting fired, much much worse for one of them. Due to family connections and a certain code, firing a fellow grey was rarely done.

What was done was archiving them, “filing them away,” for the rest of their employment. They would be demoted to the lowest level suitable for their status, put alone in a private “office” in the basement, and forgotten. The meaning was obvious. They had lost their place there and they should find another... Now.

There was something akin to a dungeon down there, but there were office chairs instead of chains.

“So that opens up a position,” his father continued. “and we prefer to promote from within...”

“Are... are you...” Vikkart stammered.

“I am,” his father said. “I’ve already conferred with your superior, and she is completely on board with the decision.”

“Varkshaa...” Vikkart chuckled ruefully.

His father looked at him strangely.

“How did you know?”

“I should have known her jumping into the elevator wasn’t by mistake,” Vikkart said, shaking his head, “It is not like her to be tardy. The raptor was likely perched, waiting for her tender little morsel to scramble past.”

“Sounds like her,” his father laughed. “Anyway, she liked the cut of your trousers and approves of your work. As she put it, you ‘creating a vacancy all by yourself,’ was the final grain on the balance. She would love for you to join her team.”

Vikkart hesitated.

“Don’t worry,” his father said, “You are much more qualified than the file folder you are replacing.”

“It’s not that,” he said, “I just will miss my coworkers.”

“Oh, you will still be in touch. Who do you think they report to?”

Vikkart felt nauseous.

“Think of it as you still being able to look out for your people,” his father said. “The elders of the blonde horde are already making a pool concerning this very possibility.”

“But I’m not ready!”

“The fact that you have that concern indicates that you are,” his father said. “Besides, with the executive position comes executive pay. You can maybe free your girl after all.”

Vikkart gasped. He hadn’t thought of that yet.

“Vikkart...” his father said cautiously, “Have you heard of the princess in the tower?”

“The princess?”

“It is an old scam,” his father said.

“Maatisha is NOT A SCAM!”

“And I hope you are right, son,” his father said, “Up until now, I was willing to let this play out. It was ‘harmless’ and, well, it kept you working, something that I long thought impossible. You have even ‘grown up’ into a fine young man. I thought you worthless. A good businessman recognizes his mistakes and turns them into profit when he can. Remember that.”

His father sighed.

“But you are now going to be in a position where you will have an influence on this company and access to funds, authority to create budgets, and the like. If this is a scam... and I hope it isn’t...” he added quickly, “But IF it is, you could do real damage to this company and to your coworkers.”

“She’s real!” Vikkart exclaimed, “I know she is!”

“Then let’s spring her,” his father said. “Tell your captors that you can pay in full. I’ll back you up to a million credits. I’ve offered ten times as much for someone to marry you before,” he laughed. “If Maatisha is real, they will have no problems releasing her. If she isn’t, they will come up with some bullshit excuse and try to string you along some more, just like that princess in that tower. Tell them that it’s a lump sum or nothing.”

“Father! If I stop paying...”

“If she’s real, they won’t turn down the money,” his father said. “I’ll even go up to five million. If that’s not enough, then nothing will be. Either she will be free and with you, or she will evaporate like the phantom she unfortunately is.”

He put his hand on Vikkart’s shoulder again. Vikkart was too overwhelmed to flinch.

“Either way, your suffering is at an end, and you can start your life for real, here, at my side. Go. Take the day and call these brutes. Don’t give them the whole five million if you don’t have to. You need to start working on your negotiating skills. Start with the debt as it is and really pay attention to what is going on.”

“Yes, Father,” Vikkart said, “And thank you.”

“Go,” his father said, “Handle your business.”

After Vikkart left, the door opened, and Varkshaa entered.

“I honestly hope I’m wrong, Vark,” Vikkart’s father said.

“Me, too.”

1hecvpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1hecvpd/how_do_i_make_her_feel_safe/,How do I make her feel safe?,"I [M31] have now been on two dates with a girl [F26]. Matched on Tinder. First date just over a week ago went fine (went for a walk and coffee). I complimented her hair and glasses. Second date today (waffles in a café) and I don't recall making any compliments (my mistake). I paid for both dates, nothing special. 

Dates are going ok, we talk 90% of the time mostly learning about each other, life experiences, but not previous dates or deep stuff.

She is an introvert and still wants to only keep talking on Tinder (while having a number of course and Insta) and she only replies like once a day (she's studies and got work so somewhat understandable).

We have hugged when saying goodbye both times, but she seems scared somehow...

I planned on us bowling on the second date and me driving her there but she didn't want me to drive (too far and cold to walk), she also doesn't want to tell me which town she lives in so we've met in my city both times. 

I fully understand that bad guys exist and that she has to be careful, but I'm struggling on how to make her feel safe (that's why I think I didn't even think of giving her a compliment on the second date).

I really hope that I'm not giving out a vibe that makes her feel unsafe as I for example haven't mentioned if we should ""go to my place"".

She could of course already have other matches or dates and that I'm just not her priority in the dating scene.

Do you guys think she's not interested? How can I make her feel safe?",2,1734211413.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

Did I misinterpret this?,"I went out with a guy and he wanted to hook up, but I wasn't sure if I want to hook up because I haven't hooked up with many people before and I used to be really religious. I wasn't sure what to do and didn't want to make it sound like his fault so in the moment I told him I was raped before (which is true). He almost immediately said he doesn't want anything serious (before this he was very keen). And proceeded to say part of him loves his ex whom he broke up a month ago (shockingly to me that's when he started messaging me) and that he will go and talk with her. When I asked more, he said they might still get married. I felt incredibly horrible knowing feeling that I was getting used and not taken seriously and also feeling like I did something wrong. I later slowly ghosted him (we never really talked about this. I accidentally left a bracelet at his place and he wanted to return it but I had said to give me some space explaining the experience was triggering. During this time he ended up getting really sick, which partially could be my fault because I was sick when I saw him--but I had told him before I was sick and maybe we should postpone. I only went over because he said he wanted to do movie night for the longest time. So it was a bit shocking that what I thought was a nice night with his housemates was actually me walking into his room and it was the two of us. At one point I said I feel better now and would like my bracelet back and we can get coffee so I can get over it. He said no because he is travelling but he can come and drop it off later. But when he came a few days later he just dropped it off at my mailbox and not in person and he didn't message me to say hi). Months later we had a call where I told him I was really upset over this and he said he didn't see me as a rebound and didn't bring up his ex only because he wanted to move past it and get himself out there again. I asked him did he have a girlfriend when we went out and he said he ""100%, definitely, and completely DO not have a girlfriend"". I then saw he posted on social media they went on vacation together with family a month later. A friend had also around the same time told me they had planned to get together at a certain point after the ex broke up with him because there was a time he thought he was in an open relationship but she didn't think so. I actually thought I had done everything I could to look out for him and even when he said he wanted to be friends I did really try my best to be a good friend. He proceeded to ghost me after very enthusiastically agreeing to help me with something (that would also benefit him). It's been a while now so I'm getting over this traumatic experience, but I still feel like what if things could have been different if I had done anything differently. I'm now worried that it's constantly going to be like this, where I always meet horrible people and I won't find someone who is going to be a nice partner to me that I really like). Is it possible that I misinterpreted anything or was this really as horrible as it sounds? Our mutual friend was really vouching for him and said I should give him a chance because he is a REALLY nice guy. But after I told her what happened she also stopped talking to him because she thinks it sounds like he used me as a rebound. ",1,1734211337.0,u_ZestycloseBird5143,0,1.0,False

# My Experience as a Beta Tester: A WhitelabelSuites Case Study

As a beta tester for WhitelabelSuites, I had the chance to put this tool through its paces before the official launch. Let me tell you, it was an eye-opening experience.

I started with PuzzleBooks AI, creating a series of logic puzzle books. The process was surprisingly simple - I just input my parameters, and the AI did the heavy lifting. Within a day, I had a collection of puzzle books ready to publish on Amazon KDP.

Next, I experimented with AppGen AI. I had an idea for a simple productivity app but no coding skills. With AppGen AI, I was able to create a functional prototype in less than an hour. It was far from perfect, but it was a solid start that I could then refine or hand off to a developer for polishing.

The real game-changer for me was Vidmails AI. I used it to create a series of video emails for a client's product launch. The engagement rates were through the roof compared to their usual text-only emails. The client was thrilled, and it led to more work and referrals.

Over the course of the beta testing period, I found myself using WhitelabelSuites almost daily. It became an integral part of my workflow, allowing me to offer services I previously would have had to outsource.

The results? In just one month of beta testing, I was able to:

* Publish 3 puzzle books on Amazon KDP
* Create 2 mobile app prototypes
* Run a successful email campaign for a client
* Create a series of educational video books for another client

While your results may vary, my experience shows the potential of what's possible with WhitelabelSuites. It's not just about the individual tools - it's about how they work together to expand what you can offer and achieve.

A Done-For-You package, possibly including pre-made templates or content.

# OTO4: WhitelabelSuite Autopilot ($37)

Adds automation features to streamline your workflow.

# How WhitelabelSuites Dominates the Competition

In the world of AI tools and white label solutions, WhitelabelSuites stands out in several ways:

1. **Comprehensive Package**: Most competitors offer single-purpose tools. WhitelabelSuites gives you six diverse AI apps in one package. 
2. **Ease of Use**: The unified dashboard makes it simple to switch between tools, streamlining your workflow. 
3. **Whitelabel Rights**: Many AI tools don't allow reselling. WhitelabelSuites explicitly encourages it, opening up new business opportunities. 
4. **Affordability**: Getting these six tools separately would cost significantly more. 
5. **Regular Updates**: As AI technology evolves, WhitelabelSuites promises to keep its tools up-to-date. 
6. **Diverse Applications**: From content creation to app development, WhitelabelSuites covers a wide range of digital needs.

# Money-Back Policy: Your Safety Net

Worried about taking the plunge? WhitelabelSuites offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. Here's the deal:

* If you can't access the software and their support team can't resolve the issue, you'll get 100% of your money back if you ask within 30 days of purchase.
* It's not a ""no questions asked"" refund. You need to provide a genuine reason and show that you've followed their instructions to try and resolve any issues.
* Refunds are primarily for technical issues that can't be resolved.
* The refund process can take up to 10 days.

Remember, filing a dispute without contacting them first will void the guarantee. Always reach out to their support team first if you're having issues.

# Price: What's the Damage?

Let's talk numbers. The front-end price for WhitelabelSuites is just $17. Yep, you read that right - seventeen bucks for access to six AI-powered apps with white label rights.

Now, if you're thinking, ""What's the catch?"" - well, there really isn't one. This is an introductory offer to get people on board. The regular price is supposed to be much higher - they mention a normal price of $197 monthly or $497 one-time.

Of course, there are those OTOs we talked about earlier if you want to upgrade, but the basic package at $17 is pretty sweet deal on its own.

# Bundle Deal: More Bang for Your Buck

WhitelabelSuites isn't just offering their tool - they're throwing in some serious bonuses too. Here's what you get in the bundle:

1. **AI Courses + All OTO Upgrades**: A software that creates a ""Udemy-like website"" with 1000+ ready-to-sell courses in 50+ niches. 
2. **50K DFY Multi-Niche eBooks + Full PLR License**: A massive collection of eBooks covering various topics, ready for you to use or sell.

The real game-changer for me was Vidmails AI. I used it to create a series of video emails for a client's product launch. The engagement rates were through the roof compared to their usual text-only emails. The client was thrilled, and it led to more work and referrals.

Over the course of the beta testing period, I found myself using WhitelabelSuites almost daily. It became an integral part of my workflow, allowing me to offer services I previously would have had to outsource.

The results? In just one month of beta testing, I was able to:

* Publish 3 puzzle books on Amazon KDP
* Create 2 mobile app prototypes
* Run a successful email campaign for a client
* Create a series of educational video books for another client

While your results may vary, my experience shows the potential of what's possible with WhitelabelSuites. It's not just about the individual tools - it's about how they work together to expand what you can offer and achieve.

# WhitelabelSuites Funnel and OTOs: What's on Offer?

WhitelabelSuites comes with a range of options to suit different needs and budgets. Here's a breakdown of the funnel:

# Front End: WhitelabelSuite ($17)

This is your entry point, giving you access to all six AI apps in the cloud-based dashboard.

# OTO1: WhitelabelSuite Pro ($37 - $47)

Upgrades your access, likely offering more features or usage limits.

# OTO2: WhitelabelSuite Unlimited ($47 - $67)

As the name suggests, this probably removes any remaining limits on usage.

A Done-For-You package, possibly including pre-made templates or content.

# OTO4: WhitelabelSuite Autopilot ($37)

Adds automation features to streamline your workflow.

Tailored for agencies, likely with multi-user features.

# OTO7: WhitelabelSuite Traffic ($27)

Includes tools or services to help drive traffic to your creations.

Remember, these are optional upgrades. The front-end product alone is powerful, but these OTOs can help you scale up if needed.

# Pros and Cons: The Good, The Bad, and The AI

Let's break down the pros and cons of WhitelabelSuites:

# Pros:

1. All-in-one solution: Six powerful AI tools in one dashboard.
2. Whitelabel rights: Rebrand and resell as your own.
3. No technical skills required: User-friendly interfaces for all tools.
4. Versatility: Useful for various industries and business models.

7. Potential for multiple income streams.

# Cons:

# How WhitelabelSuites Dominates the Competition

In the world of AI tools and white label solutions, WhitelabelSuites stands out in several ways:

1. **Comprehensive Package**: Most competitors offer single-purpose tools. WhitelabelSuites gives you six diverse AI apps in one package. 
2. **Ease of Use**: The unified dashboard makes it simple to switch between tools, streamlining your workflow. 
3. **Whitelabel Rights**: Many AI tools don't allow reselling. WhitelabelSuites explicitly encourages it, opening up new business opportunities. 
4. **Affordability**: Getting these six tools separately would cost significantly more. 
5. **Regular Updates**: As AI technology evolves, WhitelabelSuites promises to keep its tools up-to-date. 
6. **Diverse Applications**: From content creation to app development, WhitelabelSuites covers a wide range of digital needs. 
7. **No Coding Required**: Unlike many app builders or content creation tools, WhitelabelSuites doesn't require technical knowledge. 

By combining these factors, WhitelabelSuites positions itself as a one-stop shop for digital entrepreneurs, offering a competitive edge in various markets.

# Money-Back Policy: Your Safety Net

Worried about taking the plunge? WhitelabelSuites offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. Here's the deal:

* If you can't access the software and their support team can't resolve the issue, you'll get 100% of your money back if you ask within 30 days of purchase.
* It's not a ""no questions asked"" refund. You need to provide a genuine reason and show that you've followed their instructions to try and resolve any issues.
* Refunds are primarily for technical issues that can't be resolved.
* The refund process can take up to 10 days.

Remember, filing a dispute without contacting them first will void the guarantee. Always reach out to their support team first if you're having issues.

# Price: What's the Damage?

Let's talk numbers. The front-end price for WhitelabelSuites is just $17. Yep, you read that right - seventeen bucks for access to six AI-powered apps with white label rights.

Now, if you're thinking, ""What's the catch?"" - well, there really isn't one. This is an introductory offer to get people on board. The regular price is supposed to be much higher - they mention a normal price of $197 monthly or $497 one-time.

Of course, there are those OTOs we talked about earlier if you want to upgrade, but the basic package at $17 is pretty sweet deal on its own.

# Bundle Deal: More Bang for Your Buck

WhitelabelSuites isn't just offering their tool - they're throwing in some serious bonuses too. Here's what you get in the bundle:

1. **AI Courses + All OTO Upgrades**: A software that creates a ""Udemy-like website"" with 1000+ ready-to-sell courses in 50+ niches. 
2. **50K DFY Multi-Niche eBooks + Full PLR License**: A massive collection of eBooks covering various topics, ready for you to use or sell. 
3. **LogoMaker App + Full Reseller License**: Create and sell logos easily. 
4. **50K DFY Multi-Niche Articles + Full PLR License**: Another huge content bundle, this time in article format. 
5. **Exclusive Bonuses**: Including tools like SendPal (AI-driven WhatsApp autoresponder), Soundio (AI music composer), MarketAi (freelance marketplace builder), and SEOMate (backlink generator). 

These bonuses significantly increase the value of the package, giving you even more tools and content to work with or sell.

We also both struggle from anxiety, though our forms and triggers are different. I have severe social anxiety, while my mom has moderate general anxiety. My mother is also on medication, while I am not. I cook at least once every week, and I have been for almost three years. This week, I wanted to remake a soup dumpling meal I made a while back, and I needed frozen dumplings to do it. She was going to the store today because we were having guests later (At 5, and it was 12.) and I went with her. I was looking for a specific kind of soup dumpling because of my allergens, and I only knew the brand and what the bag looked like. She continued to ask me what where they were, and I said, ""I don't know"", and then the name of the dumplings. She continued to ask, and it was hard for me to focus on staying calm, her questions, and looking for the dumplings. On top of that, whenever I would get too close, she would tell me to stay in front of. the basket so I could see. I'm 5'10. The basket was not in my way at all. She kept fussing, and told me I only had ten minutes to look, even though we weren't even in the store for twenty minutes, including her looking for her stuff and waiting in a long line. When she kept nagging me about staying in front of the basket, I did, and she stopped a while back, which was my fear (Being stranded in the middle of a busy warehouse store), and I turned back to find her. When I did, she fussed at me for not continuing to look and for not hurrying, despite her stopping to look at christmas-themed coffee creamers. She asked (again) what we were looking for, and I told her, and then she revealed that she saw them in the very first aisle we looked in. I was furious, but left it alone because she was probably just focused on something else.

We got in the car, and I was playing darts online with my friend. At first, my mom seemed bothered, and then she told me to put my phone down so we could talk about what happened in the store. At first, she seemed understanding of my anxiety, and that quickly changed when she blamed my anxiety for us taking to so long. I tried to explain to her how my anxiety worked, and she said ""I don't need to be explained how anxiety works, I take medicine for that! I know how anxiety works!"" but she didn't listen when I explained to her that she was a big part of my anxiety. I've uncovered that in therapy in several occasions, too. Even when I tried to explain it, she continued to blame my anxiety for getting in the way of us finding it, even though it was sold out and that was the reason. And at the end of that part of the argument, she said that I couldn't make the meal. I was a bit confused, because I could find the dumplings almost anywhere.

When we got in the house, I went upstairs, did some cleaning for the guests that were coming over, and then asked her about why I wasn't allowed to cook the meal. She said that I wasn't allowed to because I relied too much on other people when doing anything. I asked if she meant physically or not, and she said both. I can't drive yet (my parents will not put me in drivers ed) and I don't have a job (was laid off after the place burned down), so it's impossible for me to not rely on someone. I didn't know what to say, so I asked the question again, in a different way, and she said the same thing. I asked if the meal was the problem, she agreed. I said we'd have the same problem if I cooked a different meal, and she said it wasn't true. It's pretty low to blame a dumplings before yourself, at least in my opinion.

I went upstairs (actually to create this post), but my dad called me downstairs. Then, my mom said exactly, ""I'm sorry for....\[glanced at my dad, who was glaring at her\] I'm sorry."" I just said okay, walked to the corner to get a couple chips, and then asked why she was apologizing. Not to be petty, but because she looked like she didn't even know what she was apologizing for. And with her answer, she didn't. She just said she was sorry for everything. I didn't say anything, and just did a little more cleaning (the guests still haven't arrived at this point), and blew my nose. 

Now, she's acting like it didn't even happen. My dad keeps trying to get me to forgive her, but I don't think I will. This keeps happening, and I always forgive her, and nothing changes. I've considered changing my behavior or my look on the situation, and every time I do, I get too fed up with her behavior, and an argument happens. Then she blames me, my father convinces her to apologize, she apologizes, and I forgive her, and the cycle starts again. I can tell she's still mad at me, and thinks it's my fault, so, AITA?",0,1734210853.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False

So I visited the LV store again today with a view to looking at bags.  I’m after a crossbody and I thought I’d settled on the Bologna but when I tried her on I just wasn’t feeling it.  I tried both mono with the vachett and mono with black leather but I found the bag strap not great when worn crossbody.

I then looked at the speedy 20 as I did like that one to.  But the SA showed me a speedy 25 bandolier in mono and I kinda liked it.  I’m 5ft2 and 130 poundsih and it didn’t look ridiculously big on me as I had imagined.  

I then asked to look at the pochette Metis just to see if my stuff would  fit in it and it all did but we couldn’t close the bag as the front pocket unless it’s full, the clasp is hard to close.  So I discounted it.

I was nearly there with buying the speedy 25b but decided I needed to think about it.

So I went for a coffee and I had my mind set that it’s the speedy 25b that I should I get but as I walked about,  I kept seeing people with smaller bags and it made me think is it going to be to big? 

I’m a casual type of lady.  I don’t like structured bags as they feel to mature - even though I’m not a spring chicken I like to think i am.  

I’m now so so so confused.. speedy 20, 25b or pochette Metis ???? 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️

This is what I carry daily and would need to fit in:
Long wallet,
Small wallet
Sunglasses with big case
Bunch of house keys and car keys
Tissues, 
Lip balm pot 
Small flannel (for my hot flushes 🤦🏽‍♀️)

I also already own a Graceful PM which I do use but not much as it’s not crossbody and it’s magnetic closure so don’t like using it in busy areas for safety.

1hecd73,https://www.reddit.com/r/TMAU/comments/1hecd73/fecal_bo_share_your_storysymptoms_and_treatments/,Fecal BO - Share your story/symptoms and treatments you've tried ,"Hi everyone, long story short I have been experiencing strange symptoms since grade 8 which got worse after puberty. At the time, I was constantly eating fast food and other unhealthy snacks, and had issues with my bowels, I also never used public bathroom for #2 up until maybe a few years ago so I would hold it in until I got home. 

**Symptoms:** 

chronic constipation, incomplete bowels, feeling urgency to poop but nothing comes out when going to the bathroom, very gassy, moist feeling around anus and discomfort when sitting, feeling like the anus muscle is not closed properly and feeling gas is going to leak causing me to squeeze the anus muscle or change positions when sitting, butt sweat which is mostly caused by the social anxiety, the anxiety makes the symptoms 100% worse, and the worse symptom was fecal BO that would come and go. Initially, I was not able to smell this until I started getting bullied at school every single day. This made me extremely paranoid and I had no idea what was going on. I would literally breath through my nose every 2 seconds at school because of the paranoia of smelling bad. Eventually I was able to smell this, maybe bc i was noseblind to it or the anxiety caused some gut spasms and other symptoms I mentioned above. Although I have frequent bowels now, I still have the other symptoms. **This happens mostly at school or at work where I am sitting close to someone**. 



When I am home or around family/partner, I rarely ever experience the symptoms unless I am super anxious so I know that anxiety is definitely linked to this issue whether it's gut dysbiosis, SIBO, or intestinal metabolic bromhydrosis syndrome. 

**Things that make the symptoms worse:**

Coffee

Dairy 

Adderall (I have ADHD), I stopped taking meds bc it made the symptoms worse. 

Alcohol 

Sitting 

Lots of carbs 

People's reactions -> this makes it even worse, feeling embarrassed and anxious 

**This is not a hygiene issue** as I shower everyday, scrub well, clean clothes, use antiperspirant products and expensive low synthetic perfumes, and have frequent dental cleanings. Also, when I go to the bathroom while at school or work, I wipe and there is nothing on the paper, and underwear smells like laundry detergent and normal sweat smell, not fecal or sewage smell. But then I go back to class or work to sit, and 1-2 mins later the smell is emitting intermittently. Most of the time its a fecal fart smell, sometimes it smells like sewage/dirty laundry. This is not olfactory syndrome bc I was bullied for it for years, and although I don't get rude comments anymore, I still see people's reactions and I can even smell it myself. 

10 years ago, I went to a GI doctor, did several tests and a colonoscopy all of which were normal so I gave up going to the doctor, one doc said its all in my head and gave me some SSRIs which helped me the anxiety but not other the symptoms, sometimes the anxiety got worse. 

**Things I have tried:**

Shaving hair down there - symptoms improved by maybe 5% likely bc hair traps the sweat and bacteria. 

Keto diet (only meat and vegetables, very little carb less than 50g/day. This improved symptoms by maybe 10% but the symptoms were still there but less frequent. I did this for a month, and maintaining this diet is extremely difficult and not healthy. However, if this diet cured my symptoms i would have continued it forever. 

Supplements/Meds: Chlorophyll, Digestive Enzymes, Pre and Probiotics, Pepto Bis, Many antioxidants, Psyllium Husk, Magnesium, Amoxicillin, Antimicrobial supplements, Artichoke and Ginger.

These supplements may have helped me with bowel movements but even after having a BM (I have like 3 a day), the smell and other symptoms are still there. Also, I use water to wash my ass and wipe after every bowel movement so Ik im not missing a spot. 

I will be trying kombucha and betaine HCL to see if that helps. I will also be going to a GI doctor to try Rifaxibin and an anorectal MRI but it might take months to get a referral. 

This condition is extremely debilitating, and I read hundreds of similar reddit posts on this issue (particularly the FECAL BO) but no one has found a cure. I know its not TMAU because I dont have a fishy smell, its mostly fecal and sometimes sewage/dirty laundry smell, and my relatives and close friends don't smell it. 

Please share your story and treatments you've tried that helped get rid of this FECAL bo. I know this has to be some sort of metabolic issue, gut dysbiosis, or intestinal and anus muscle issues linked to social anxiety. ",1,1734209978.0,TMAU,0,1.0,False

After taking a lot of research I really do believe I found out what the Will of D. is or should I say the ""WHEEL OF D."" and actually what the One Piece is

You guys know how Oda brings puns into the manga. And I really think the Will Of D. is somehow connected to the ...  
**WHEEL OF DHARMA**

https://preview.redd.it/zsbr1sembs6e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=709a0026a43129ce514a8d1b667b013027343269

**FIRST:** The WHEEL of Dharma is a symbol used in the Dharmic religions (mostly 4 which are Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism and Sikhs). It symbolizes the ""Noble Eightfold Path"".

https://preview.redd.it/p9mwt9g80u6e1.png?width=955&format=png&auto=webp&s=884fcc97e19be935608e2200e498ab016c1704de

Following the Noble Eightfold Path leads to liberation. When we think about our known D. members this fits very well, right? Luffy for example respects life so much that he is caring for other lifes as much (Right Livelihood). Luffy represents this path. The D. embody this path very well. But where Dharma is there is also Adharma meaning there are people who are doing the opposite. This could go back to Blackbeard and Rocks D. Xebec. As a D. member they should naturally go for this path but are doing the complete opposite. Blackbeard for example has as far as I have seen a wrong view, wrong intentions, wrong actions, wrong efforts and so on. He resembles the Anti-Joyboy. But to understand Dharma a little bit more ...

**SECOND:**

Dharma has many meanings in sanskrit, vedic sansrikt and in a religious sense for example:

to hold, maintain, keep, what is established, firm, bearer, supporter, order, rhythm, law, rule, truth, principle of natural order which regulates and coordnates the operation of the universe and everything within in, right way of living, path of rightness

And the following path was actually insane to read on wikipedia and I added my interpretation (in brackets) on this one:

*""The Buddha (Joyboy or Nika) is said to have set the ""wheel of dharma"" in motion when he delivered his first sermon. \[...\] This ""turning of the wheel"" signifies a great and revolutionary change (an era, pirate era) with universal consequences, brought about by an exceptional human being. Buddhism adopted the wheel as a symbol from the Indian mythical idea of the ideal king, called a* ***CHAKRAVARTIN*** *(""wheel-turner"" = pirate), \[...\] Siddhartha Gautama (Luffy and Joyboy) was said to have been a ""mahapurisa"" (great man = supreme king) who could have chosen to become a wheel turning king (Pirate King), but instead became the spiritual counterpart to such a king, a wheel turning sage, that is, a Buddha (Warrior of Liberation = Sun God Nika).""*

I think Oda took inspiration from this text which is intended to explain a bit what it means to be Supreme King, what it means to be Pirate King and who is destined to become the warrior of liberation. Anyone can become a pirate, not many can become a Supreme King, only one can be the Pirate King but the actual goal is to become a warrior of liberation. That's why I highlighted Chakravartin so much. There are 3 types of Chakravartin:

* Chakravala: An emperor (Imu, WG, Celestial Dragons, Marine) who rules over all FOUR of the continents  (West Blue, East Blue, South Blue, North Blue)
* Dvipa: A ruler (King, Queen, Pirate Emperor) who governs only one on those continents (kingdom, islands)
* Pradesha: A monarch (Emperor, strong pirate) who leads the people of only a part of a continent (island)

Emperors like Kaido and Big Mom for example governed Wano and WCI while Luffy freed Wano from them to become their own country again. Because Luffy doesn't want an island. He himself says pirate king means to become the freest man on the sea. I think that is also why Imu is falsely equivalent to Buddha (The two-katakana making up Imu's name (**イム**), which means ""buddha"") is actually a FALSE Buddha and Luffy, Joyboy and Nika are the actual Buddhas in their era because they wanted to fight for freedom which fits very well on this quote:

*""Buddha taught a Middle Way between sensual indulgence and severe asceticism, leading to freedom from ignorance, craving, rebirth, and suffering.""*

Well, but that doens't explain why Wheel Of Dharma is connected with the Will Of D. Sure we could argue the obvious one that Wheel = Will because we all know Oda and his puns. And maybe Dharma (japanese = Daruma) was a name for Joyboy, the ancient kingdom, an ancestor or the one who made his wheel for his ship. Many things we yet have to discover by following the story of One Piece. Maybe you have some thoughts?

**THIRD:** Let us see the connections that is referenced with Dharma/Dharmachakra and the One Piece World:

(WARNING: The cooking-express has arrived!)

The Prakrit word ""dham-ma"" in the Brahmi script is ..

BUT! When we turn this thing upside down as Gol D. Roger once said and mirroring it:

https://preview.redd.it/6llt742eys6e1.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce52a23f2e549b348bdcb6788a73621ac2569830

I really wanna believe that this is a coincidence but it is very hard, you guys! I think Oda was inspired by that. Jaya, Shandora and the missing island are part of the ancient kingdom. I think the Will Of D. has its very roots in the ancient kingdom. I do believe that Arabasta was also part of it since there is a river called ""Sandora River"" and Shandora and Arabasta had the poneglyphs locating the ancient weapons. As well as we know that Lili scattered the ponegliffs and she knew very well where to. I don't wanna go too deep in this because its way too large of a topic and we are here for the D. <- lol

Dharma in japanese means ""Daruma"". It's a famous lucky charm in Japan which is made of papier-mâché and weighted (maybe with the Inherited Will) to prevent it from falling over. This gives you the courage to pick yourself up again in any situation. This fits to Luffy and other members of the D.

Also a note but maybe a coincidence. Dharma was first discovered in an indus script with ten characters. Maybe a connection to the OP Logo? Not sure about that one.

The Wheel of Dharma is seen as sun-symbol at many places around the world. Wheel symbols were used as a solar symbol by the Ancient Egyptians. But what I think is very interesting, the wheel is often built at the entrances of stupas and I found it strange that buddhist stupas looked like straw hats but especially the stupa in Bharhut.

https://preview.redd.it/jueder6reu6e1.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=7482f9289628760a23450071dd2b8319ba79da42

[Red in buddhism is believed that its a protective color and shows the element of fire.](https://preview.redd.it/9iwm18zynu6e1.png?width=529&format=png&auto=webp&s=84547b0ef8a06f0defad196848b9046d81960bce)

Stupas are a Buddhist religious building containing the RELICS of Buddha (Joyboy) and his DISCIPLES (his crew). Is that the One Piece? WHO KNOWS?!?!? Its basically a tomb and I saw a lot of theories that the One Piece is a tomb so maybe there is a connection! That could also mean why the straw hat is passed down to so many ""possible JoyBoys and Nikas"". Because HE is the one who can access the tomb, the One Piece! Also to notice in the tomb there were pinnacles and they looked like this:

https://preview.redd.it/tsco5mzcbu6e1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c78aef7938628dc860b95e966736981456cbc20f

My interpretation of this one:

https://preview.redd.it/l02cocfsru6e1.png?width=1458&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc71ec350350dbdf1d198722bea87dad828b8669

I actually think that the crest of the Kouzuki Clan was an alliance between those families:

* Whale fin = Ryugu Kingdom, Fishmen Island
* Wheel Of Dharma = D. Clan (this could include Nefertari family already, maybe Joyboy and Lili were engaged and thats why she got the D.)
* Nefertari Family, Wheel Of Dharma = Arabasta Kingdom (D. Clan)
* 2 Swords = Shimotsuki Family = Wano
* Toki Amatsuki, crescent moon with bird = Amatsuki Family = Wano
* Dressrosa Map = Donquixote Family (Doflamingo maybe foreshadow to Imu?)

Maybe the Donquixote family was an ally and someone or all of them betrayed the alliance/ancient kingdom. This crest could be a foreshadow as when Mjosgard helped Shirahoshi at Mary Geoise and Doflamingo is actually the foreshadow of Imu. But I am not done yet:

Another insane one is coming now! You guys remember the Eve tree that protrudes into the Red Line up to Mary Geoise? What if I tell you thats the Bodhi Tree. Also called as Mahabodhi Tree (sounds like Sabaody) and its the tree of awakening or tree of enlightment. Under the Bodhi tree is the the Vajrasana, the Enlightment Throne of the Buddha also called Diamond Throne which is ""THE EMPTY THRONE"". That throne was a focus of devotion in early Buddhism, treated as a symbolic relic. It was not intended to be occupied, but operated as a symbol of the missing Buddha. Ancient images show devotees kneeling in prayer before it, as they still do. And as I previously mentioned:

>*Siddhartha Gautama (Luffy and Joyboy) was said to have been a ""mahapurisa"" (great man = supreme king) who could have chosen to become a wheel turning king (Pirate King), but instead became the spiritual counterpart to such a king, a wheel turning sage, that is, a Buddha (Warrior of Liberation = Sun God Nika).""*

The Vajrasana is the throne *of enlightenment*) of Gautama Buddha (Nika, Joyboy, Luffy). Being the site where Gautama Buddha achieved liberation. And do you remember when Imu is standing in front of the giant straw hat?

Well, the throne's right side looks like this:

https://preview.redd.it/9pzxx29zdv6e1.png?width=1247&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdc3342a2b6090b9812fe076d73a58f4a2a64f3b

Maybe Oda did change it a little bit but this is more a grave than an actual throne.

I think the Straw Hat resembles somehow a grave. Maybe there was once a good connection between Imu, Lili and Joyboy. That's why I'm suspecting Imu being actually a member of the Donquixote family but betrayed them for whatever reason to become the ruler of the world. It could make sense since Doflamingo knows very much about Mary Geoise and the hidden treasure. Maybe the Donquixote family enjoy more privileges than the other celestial dragons.

Imu is also a refernce to [Mara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mara_(demon)), a demon who wanted to stop Buddha. This is worth another post tho.

**FOURTH: Poneglyphs are the reference to ""Edicts of Ashoka""**

[**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edicts\_of\_Ashoka**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edicts_of_Ashoka)

>The **Edicts of Ashoka** are a collection of more than 30 inscriptions (like the 30 poneglyphs) on the Pillars of Ashoka, as well as boulders and cave walls, attributed to Emperor Ashoka of the Maurya Empire. Ashoka used the expression ""Inscriptions of the Dharma"" to describe his own Edicts. These inscriptions were dispersed throughout the areas of modern-day India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Afghanistan and Pakistan to provide the first tangible evidence of Buddhism. The edicts describe in detail Ashoka's policy on dhamma, an earnest attempt to solve some of the problems that a complex society faced. According to the edicts, the extent of Buddhist proselytism during this period reached as far as the Mediterranean, and many Buddhist monuments were created.

**FINAL CONCLUSION:**

The fact that this is a Wheel. I mean all pirates have to have a wheel to cruise with their ship. This could be a very well thought-out connection to the Will of D., taking a real life reference as Wheel of Dharma and putting it into One Piece, a world of pirates where a wheel steers the ship.

As you can see everything I mentioned is somehow connected with One Piece, The Will Of D., and so on....   I GUESS..... I also think tho that the Will Of D. may be far, far older. Like older than Joyboy, meaning in the time where Nika probably vanished or when the ancient kingdom was built. Maybe the ancient kingdom's name was Dharma/Daruma (back then with their beliefs just like the Wheel Of Dharma and the Noble Eightful Path) and all the other kingdoms joined their beliefs and became bigger. But I wanna hear your opinions and please tell me that this whole theory is so damn cooked that your eyes fell out. Thank you!!

I’m Summer, a 31-year-old woman based in Seattle, ready to meet someone who can match my energy for fun dates, great conversations, and genuine connection. I work nights, but for the right person, I’ll always make time. And if we really click? I’m absolutely open to traveling to meet someone special.

About me:
I’m the perfect mix of sweet and spicy, balancing a warm, nurturing side with a playful streak that keeps things exciting. As a passionate foodie and music lover, I’m always on the hunt for the next incredible meal or live show to share with someone. Exploring new places, finding hidden gems in random cities, and creating unforgettable memories are some of my favorite ways to spend time.

What makes me stand out is how much I care. I’m intuitive and thoughtful, always paying attention to the little things that bring joy to the people in my life. Whether it’s surprising you with your favorite coffee, organizing a date tailored just for you, cooking your favorite meal from scratch on a random Tuesday, or offering a supportive ear after a long day, I bring a sense of comfort, fun, and calm that’s hard to find.

I love the idea of being an asset to a busy man’s life. I’ll help you decompress, make you feel valued, and keep things running smoothly in ways you didn’t even realize you needed. I’m someone who’s confident in what I offer—playful affection, undivided attention, meaningful connection, and a touch of romance to make your life even better.

What I’m looking for:
I’m drawn to kind men who are thoughtful, witty, and well-read. Someone who knows how to hold a conversation, make me laugh, and bring out my flirty side. If you’re a romantic who enjoys affection and attention we’re already off to a great start.

I love the dynamic of a 1950s-style relationship with a modern twist. I want to spoil you with thoughtful gestures—cooking your meals, tying your tie in the morning (after you teach me, of course!), or surprising you with little touches that make your life better. And in return, I want to feel safe, adored, and taken care of. If the idea of massages just because I can’t keep my hands off you or stolen moments filled with affection sounds like your love language, we’ll be a perfect match.

I’m looking for someone who can keep up with me—whether it’s an adventurous day out exploring the city, a quiet night in filled with laughter and good food, or a weekend getaway planned on a whim. I want a partner who’s excited to build something meaningful, filled with trust, passion, and a sense of playfulness.

What’s next?
If this sounds like the kind of dynamic you’re looking for, send me a message! Tell me about a date you’ve been vying to have, your go-to meal for impressing someone, or the concert that changed your life. Who knows? We could just plan our first date around it!",0,1734209099.0,SLFmeetups,0,0.5,False

She once sent a pic of best friend tattoos and I was like yeah let’s do it! And months later when I brought it up she was like oh when are you getting that done? When I said it was her idea to get them she said haha that’s weird and skipped around the subject and I knew I had been dumped. 
For a little backstory, we worked as managers at the same place for about 8 years. We were extremely close, but I quit and while we were able to keep in touch for a couple years after, she has very obviously started posting about her new bestie and I’m now referred to as just a friend. 
We used to do a overnight stay out of town to just relax and get away from our husbands and kids, we didn’t do it this past year, but she has been bringing it up every few months. She says she so excited and looks forward to it, but I can’t help but think she’s looking for a free trip since I use my hotel points and pay for the room. 
I will also add that I’m autistic and I have the worst time navigating friendships, I will text and send memes over meeting for coffee, hell I’ve sent her countless Venmo’s for her to get a coffee or whatever but its just now starting to feel extremely one sided.

The Franklin struggle elevated the importance of ""political line"" and democratic centralism within the RU. They concluded that the issue was not just military strategy, but the entire political line. The RU adopted Mao's concept of line, emphasizing the connection between knowledge and practical action. However, Mao's outlook also contained a strong element of voluntarism, prioritizing will. This view suggests that a correct political line guarantees success, regardless of initial resources. This transforms principles and strategic vision into dogma, a concept the RU and later the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP) increasingly embraced. The RU’s views on “correct line” emphasized studying revolutionary theory, specifically the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao. This ""study"" prioritized these texts over broader research and investigation. This concept was modified by the mass line, also popularized by Mao, which advocated learning from the masses and synthesizing their experience into principles and methods. This offered a unique connection to various groups. However, the RU/RCP, like their Chinese counterparts, maintained their authority within the Leninist vanguard model. While mass experience was considered raw material, the party, through its application of Marxism-Leninism, ultimately determined what was in the masses’ best interests.

[William Hinton](https://preview.redd.it/pcuo28g9kv6e1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=fff1f2267c4a552cd8fb6eccbc8bbc108038f259)

Mao's quote about internationalism and communism highlights the spirit of selfless support for the Chinese people's liberation. A report on Victoria Garvin's speech praised the social and economic conditions in Communist China. William Hinton's return from China in 1953 was marked by the seizure of his collected materials by US Customs. This included posters, books, pamphlets, reports, photos, and notebooks, all meticulously itemized by the FBI. This seizure led to years of struggle for Hinton to reclaim his materials and ultimately resulted in a highly influential book in the 1960s. This story is crucial for understanding 1960s history and the Revolutionary Union (RU) and later the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP). Hinton faced not only the seizure but also disruptive investigations by the FBI and Congress, despite the FBI finding no evidence of him being recruited by the Chinese Communists for subversive activities. His papers were sent to Senator James Eastland, who held nationally televised hearings in 1953. The committee sought information about Hinton's time in China and his political affiliations, promising the return of his materials in exchange for his appearance, a promise they did not keep.

https://preview.redd.it/vcc6qq6bkv6e1.png?width=306&format=png&auto=webp&s=7434565b36b7489d7e115083687513c425dd7d13

Hinton’s book, Fanshen, focused on agrarian reform in China, arguing that understanding the land question was crucial for understanding the Chinese Revolution and the contemporary world. The book documented China’s emergence from extreme poverty after the 1949 Communist takeover, seemingly offering an alternative to the Soviet model. Fanshen described the suffering before the Communists came to power, particularly the widespread famine. It recounted witness testimony of families resorting to desperate measures during famine years. The book then detailed the Communist Party's efforts in Long Bow village to implement land reform. According to Hinton, this transformed not only the land system but also the political, cultural, and social structures, including granting property rights to women. Fanshen presented a largely positive narrative, drawing global conclusions about the peasants’ transformation into active builders of a new world. The book emphasized the positive aspects of the events he witnessed, lacking critical scrutiny.

https://preview.redd.it/pws3b6dckv6e1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=47977ce4654496704abd979908934ba1cf445d19

Fanshen was part of a wave of books and testimonies from Western authors with experience in China that were published in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These works provided a counterpoint to prevailing narratives about China in the US and suggested an alternative to Western capitalism. Joshua Horn’s Away With All Pests documented the stark contrast between pre-revolutionary Shanghai and his 1965 visit, highlighting the eradication of previously widespread social problems. Fanshen was uniquely successful, even influencing broader culture.

The FBI viewed Hinton’s work as subversive and monitored and attempted to suppress it. FBI surveillance documents, released through a Freedom of Information Act request, reveal this. Hinton’s own attempts to access his FBI files were largely unsuccessful due to heavy redactions. FBI records concerning Hinton’s involvement with the RU and the USCPFA appear to have been destroyed. Some information is found in a background check of R. Sargent Shriver, who was a student assistant for Hinton’s mother. This revealed an informant report recounting Hinton’s removal from Communist Party leadership in 1963 for supporting Chinese Communist policies. He was expelled from the party in 1964. Hinton’s break with the CPUSA coincided with the Sino-Soviet split. He attempted to garner support for his position and was reportedly holding meetings to initiate a new organization promoting the Chinese viewpoint. He later became part of the RU. While Hinton never publicly identified as a member of either the Communist Party or the RU, Larry Goff's 1972 Congressional testimony confirmed Hinton's RU membership. Hinton was a politically active advocate of Maoist socialism and played a key role in early RU organizing. Raymond Lotta recalled Hinton’s influential campus visit in 1970, where he discussed the Chinese revolution and the Cultural Revolution. Former SDS leader Mark Rudd noted that Fanshen was required reading in all collectives.

US authorities, particularly the FBI, viewed Leibel Bergman, considered the founder and key leader of the Revolutionary Union (RU), as a product of conspiratorial interaction with the Chinese Communist Party, not as a result of domestic turmoil within the US. A report prepared for President Nixon outlined Bergman's clandestine travel to China in 1965, where he supposedly resided for two years under a pseudonym. Upon his return in 1967, Bergman allegedly told FBI sources he had returned ""to do a job"" for the Chinese Communists. This mission supposedly involved forming a national union of pro-Maoist radicals, forwarding information to the Chinese, and recruiting agents for training in China. This assessment led to Bergman being labeled a ""Chicom Intelligence Agent,"" justifying the FBI's campaign against him and the RU.This allegation led to intense government surveillance of Bergman, including monitoring public information, using informants, wiretapping his phone, breaking into his apartment to place microphones, and possibly deploying closed-circuit television cameras. The 1980 trial of FBI agents W. Mark Felt and Edward S. Miller revealed details of the FBI's efforts against Bergman. Testimony from the FBI agent overseeing the Bergman investigation confirmed the use of surreptitious entry and microphone installation. The Bureau also obtained a floor plan of Bergman's apartment to facilitate potential photographic coverage. These measures were approved by top FBI officials, including J. Edgar Hoover himself.

[Zhou Enlai, 1st Premier of the People's Republic of China](https://preview.redd.it/b2fmowzdkv6e1.png?width=220&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ccab95242db04b61ea00c681d4c7066b9eba47)

In 1971, six RU members traveled to China at the Chinese government's invitation. They met with Zhou Enlai, along with other Americans, including members of the American Friends Service Committee and the Black Panther Party. Official Chinese reports described the meeting as ""cordial"" and ""friendly."" An informant embedded within the larger American delegation reported specific details of the meetings. For instance, Zhou questioned Bill Epton, a former member of Progressive Labor (PLP), about the party's strength and internal dissent. This exchange suggests Chinese interest in US radical circles and lends some credence to FBI reports about Bergman ""doing a favor"" for his Chinese contacts. This visit signaled the end of the PLP's position as the officially sanctioned Maoist force in the US.

There are a couple things I'm worried about, so I'm just noting them here.

First, I'm not sure whether to label this literary fiction or upmarket contemporary; I'm leaning on the former, but would appreciate any advice. I've attached the first 300 to see if people feel it looks more like one or the other.

Second, my book grapples with a lot of tough themes, particularly regarding internalized transphobia/homophobia, as well as the complexities of navigating relationships with people who might hold beliefs you strongly disagree with and/or don't fully support who you are. I think both are extremely important topics which a lot of queer people, particularly those living in conservative areas, have to grapple with today and which I've struggled to find represented in fiction. But I'm also a bit worried that agents will read me as supporting some of the decisions/beliefs belonging to characters in my book, which is often not at all the case. Any advice on that (as well as feedback if certain parts of the query spring red flags) would be appreciated.

Third, and related to point #2, I'm wondering if it's inadvisable to use Everything's Fine as a comp. I know there was a lot of pushback against that book on release; from what I can tell, that was mostly the result of terrible marketing, not the book itself, but I'm still uncertain about it. Themes-wise, though, it has a very similar vibe to my book.

Thanks a ton in advance for the help!

QUERY:

Dear Agent,

As a nerdy trans guy growing up in rural Minnesota, Stephen Kowalski dreamed of the day he’d get to go to college and finally meet his people. But once he actually enrolls at an elite university, he feels awkward and ignorant compared to his urban peers. Though his locale has changed, Stephen is friendless as ever.

Until he meets Matthew Wallace.

Matthew is gentle, thoughtful, and strong. Rather than see Stephen as a weirdo, Matthew says he’s actually kind of endearing. And not only does he love hearing Stephen talk about Shakespeare, but he has some wonderful insights of his own.

When Matthew introduces Stephen to the rest of his friend-group—shy botanist Owen, sarcastic socialite Farhad—Stephen feels for the first time that he’s found a home. And as the others confide in him, he realizes they feel much the same way. There’s something exhilarating about their group, something powerful, wonderful… maybe even permanent.

Except Matthew isn’t just kind and clever: he’s a conservative Catholic. When that fact becomes an unavoidable presence amongst their group, their tight-knit bonds begin to unravel. And when a student-council controversy throws abortion rights into the center of campus politics, the pressure on Stephen to denounce Matthew only grows. Stephen thought he was willing to give up anything for friendship, but it’s beginning to look as though the price might be himself.

Toggling between Stephen’s time in college and his adulthood a decade later, On Friendship is an exploration of political principle, platonic love, and the repercussions of sacrificing one for the other. At approximately 65,000 words, On Friendship is an adult literary fiction novel perfect for fans of James Frankie Thomas’ Idlewild and Cecilia Rabess’ Everything's Fine. Like Stephen, I am a trans man.

Sincerely,

FIRST 300:

I saw Farhad again today.

It was a regular mid-winter Manhattan morning, the same as every one which had come before. Snow littered the alleyways and the skyscrapers stood out like sedate tombstones against the still gray sky. Swollen garbage bags spilled out on every corner. I picked my way alone over each one. Beneath the looming towers, I seemed insubstantial as one of Dante’s lukewarm souls. The air was damp and cold, the world monochrome and empty. I felt nothing.

I found the cafe warm and smelling of stale donuts. At six am, it was crowded already with shadow-eyed office workers. The cashier eyed me wearily over the register. Her name was Daniela; her age late-forties; her nails blue-painted; her husband mean; her children quarrelsome; her one solace taped episodes of Por Estas Calles played late at night. I’d gleaned all this over eight years of ordering coffee here, eight years in which she had not recognized me once.

That was hardly Daniela’s fault, not that it would be a fault in the first place. Ever since I moved to New York, I have become by some strange magic almost invisible. Even my own coworkers forget my existence. Consequently, when someone called my name in the cafe, I assumed they meant another person.

“Stephen!”

I squinted at Daniela, though the voice had been male. She turned the credit card reader towards me with her regular disinterest.

“Stephen!” someone said again, and this time a hand, searingly warm, landed on my shoulder.

I turned.

All of a sudden, it was as if a window, which for year after year had blown in icy wind and summer rain and the screeches of traffic and the tiresome arguments of my neighbors below, were shut fast.",2,1734208699.0,PubTips,2,1.0,False

>I moved into my house earlier this year and developed a pretty cool rapport with my neighbor to my south. This fall, he took care of the leaves on my front yard (he argued that they were from his tree but he could have just as easily let me deal with it). Last week he even brought up my cans while I was traveling, even though I already had a friend who was planning on doing it for me on their way home from work. Being a single guy who travels for work, I really appreciate having a chill neighbor.

>Edit: So the only things I really know about the guy is that he and his wife are in a jazz band. He's older than the average person in the neighborhood, and his kids are moved out (but not elderly). He also works at the local university and gifted me a bag of corn the day after NIU upset Notre Dame. His wife is also in higher ed, but works at a different university. One more thing! He and his wife are into bird watching. I guess I do know more about the guy than I thought.

*Found in the Pantry. Lucanis doesn't know how it got there.*

(Ugh. Fine. Assan will be outside the Lighthouse. Rook will definitely stop sulking when he does his rounds. - Davrin)



\---

I needed to write this down.

Or else I might be going crazy.

For Lucanis I mean.

I’ll never be able to walk into the pantry without my heart skipping a beat ever again...

I’d gone to Lucanis’ quarters—to talk, maybe ease some of his worries. I was mid-sentence, I think I was telling him how much I admired him, his resolve, his resilience despite Spite—I don’t even remember—when the air *shifted*. He looked at me, *really* looked at me, with those piercing eyes of his. His voice dropped, low and husky, and suddenly the pantry felt much, much smaller.

He moved closer, his hand bracing against the wall just beside my head, his body looming over me like I was a caged fox. I couldn’t move. Didn’t *want* to move. The scent of coffee lingered on him, mingling with something distinctly Lucanis—steel, leather, *danger*.

My hand betrayed me first, grazing his shirt's vest, feeling the firm muscle underneath. It was instinct, curiosity, or perhaps sheer desperation. He came closer, his face inches from mine, his breath warm on my skin. My heart raced, every nerve on edge, and I couldn’t help myself—I leaned in.

Just as our lips were about to touch, he *stopped.* His eyes, still burning with want, flickered with hesitation. Then he pulled back, mumbling something incoherent about needing to clear his head.

And then he *left.* Left me there, trembling, clutching the wall behind me like it might keep me upright. My thoughts were a blur of frustration, confusion, and longing.

Damn him. Damn his coffee, damn his smoldering eyes, and damn me for wanting him so badly.

I'm playing with fire.

And yet, I know I won't mind the burns in the slightest.

Ugh, Viago is going to kill me...

\---

*Okay, so the plot thickens. Was definitely Fred.*

*Harding caught Fred, who left the page in the pantry for... Lucanis?*

*She of course told us that she's helping him matchmake.*

*Wait. Was Manfred trying to give this to Spite?*

*Hmmm. Looks like Curiosity wanted help out his friend.*

*Will ask Emmrich for his perspective.*

*NB: Why are the resident assassins having so much trouble with this nonsense?*

*Vishante kaffas, they kill for a living, it's not that difficult to understand.*

*-Neve*

It appears we had a stowaway when we brought the plants in. We've temporarily moved it into our spare room which houses the bulk of the outdoor plants in the winter.

From what I've been reading, we can do the sugar water and cotton ball thing. We normally keep halos (small citrus) on hand so I'm pretty sure we can keep it fed. While bringing in the plants, the wife also decided to rehome an orb weaver spider who lives in the same room that the butterfly now lives in. I'm worried about the two meeting; as that might not fare well for the butterfly.

Was thinking maybe trap/box it and put it in the garage so that it would hibernate for the winter, then release it once temps come back up.  Wife also thought maybe someplace like the Detroit Zoo might take it in as they have a butterfly garden (We're in the greater Detroit Metro area - Rule 6).

Looking for advice on care or where we could take it to live a long and healthy life. Or if anyone has an experience keeping butterflies indoor over the winter. Or any experience ""donating"" butterflies?

We believe It's a black swallowtail.

I switched to oatmilk earlier this year after trying a Starbucks drink with oatmilk and immediately loved it. Then my constipation and bloating symptoms increased. I started getting more depressed. It took me months to figure out it was from the oatmilk.

I looked at the ingredients and thought the canola oil might be triggering it. I went on this search for different oatmilk trying to find one that didn't make me sick. I finally bought one that has no extra additives. It's just oats and water. I tried it today and it by far has made me the sickest. I put a tablespoon of it in my coffee and 30 minutes later I felt the nausea, cramps, and bloating.

So now I have to switch back to dairy which makes me sad because I don't actually like milk very much but I haven't found an alternative that I like better (besides oatmilk).",4,1734207858.0,ibs,8,0.84,False

Matched on Tinder. First date just over a week ago went fine (went for a walk and coffee). I complimented her hair and glasses. Second date today (waffles in a café) and I don't recall making any compliments (my mistake). I paid for both dates, nothing special. 

Dates are going ok, we talk 90% of the time mostly learning about each other, life experiences, but not previous dates or deep stuff.

She is an introvert and still wants to only keep talking on Tinder (while having a number of course and Insta) and she only replies like once a day (she's studies and got work so somewhat understandable).

We have hugged when saying goodbye both times, but she seems scared somehow...

I planned on us bowling on the second date and me driving her there but she didn't want me to drive (too far and cold to walk), she also doesn't want to tell me which town she lives in so we've met in my city both times. 

I fully understand that bad guys exist and that she has to be careful, but I'm struggling on how to make her feel safe (that's why I think I didn't even think of giving her a compliment on the second date).

I really hope that I'm not giving out a vibe that makes her feel unsafe as I for example haven't mentioned if we should ""go to my place"".

She could of course already have other matches or dates and that I'm just not her priority in the dating scene.

I. The Separation

When the tether snapped, Martinez didn't scream. The sound died in her throat as she watched the Helios Station drift away, its silver hull growing smaller against the star-speckled darkness until it was just another point of light in the infinite black. In that first moment of separation, time seemed to stretch like taffy, her mind recording every excruciating detail with crystalline clarity.

She remembered the sound—a sharp ping that resonated through her suit's structure, followed by an uncanny silence. The carbon-fiber tether, rated for tensions far beyond what she was exerting, had separated as cleanly as if it had been cut. Later, in her more lucid moments, she would wonder if something out there had cut it deliberately.

Six hours earlier, she'd been drinking coffee in the station's observation module, watching the sunrise over the Pacific for the third time that day. Station Commander Chen had approached her about a routine maintenance check on the external sensor array—a simple job she'd performed dozens of times before. ""Should take you two hours tops, Martinez,"" he'd said, his weathered face creasing into a smile. ""Be back in time for Sarah's birthday celebration.""

Sarah. Martinez's hand instinctively went to the small photo tucked into her suit's wrist computer—her daughter's fourth birthday, captured just weeks before this mission began. The movement sent her into a slow spin, and she fought down a wave of nausea as the Earth and stars traded places in her field of view.

The maintenance itself had been going perfectly. She'd replaced two degraded optical sensors and was in the process of recalibrating the thermal imaging array when she noticed something odd. A shadow had passed over her work area—impossible, given their orbital position and angle relative to the Earth. She'd looked up, expecting to see one of the station's solar panels, but there had been nothing. Nothing except a momentary distortion in the starfield, like heat waves rising from hot asphalt.

That's when the tether broke.

Her suit's stabilizers kicked in automatically, firing brief bursts of gas to arrest her spin. Each tiny jet of vapor was precious—the maneuvering fuel was limited, and she'd need every molecule if rescue came. If. The word hung in her mind like a death sentence.

""Helios Station, this is Martinez,"" she called into her radio, forcing her voice to remain steady. ""Emergency, emergency. Tether failure during EVA. I am untethered and drifting."" Static answered her. She checked her suit's communications panel—everything showed green, but the signal strength meter was already dropping.

""Helios Station, please respond."" She could still see the station clearly, its solar arrays catching the sunlight like golden wings. Someone had to be monitoring her frequency. They had to see her drifting away. ""This is Martinez. Does anyone copy?""

The static took on a different quality, a rhythmic pulsing that made her think of heartbeats. For a moment, she thought she heard voices buried in the noise—not the familiar tones of her crewmates, but something else. Something that spoke in frequencies that made her teeth ache.

She forced herself to look away from the radio and assess her situation. The suit's diagnostic panel displayed her vital statistics with cruel precision: heart rate elevated but within acceptable parameters, oxygen supply at 97%, power systems nominal. Eight hours of life, assuming nothing else failed. Eight hours during which she would drift further and further from the station, from Earth, from everything human.

The math was simple and terrible. At her current velocity—she checked the laser rangefinder—she was moving away from the station at just over two meters per second. Too slow for a quick death in the atmosphere, too fast for her remaining maneuvering fuel to make a difference. The backup beacon would transmit her location for seventy-two hours, but she'd be long dead before then if rescue didn't come quickly.

She tried to remember her emergency training. Step one: assess immediate threats to life. None, beyond the obvious fact that she was floating in an environment lethal to human life. Step two: establish communication. Failed. Step three: conserve resources and wait for rescue. That was all that remained—waiting, floating in a perfect void with only her thoughts for company.

The Earth hung below her, a blue and white goddess that filled nearly a quarter of her field of view. Martinez had always loved looking at it from space, had spent countless hours in the cupola module just watching the continents drift past. But now something was different. The longer she stared, the more the clouds seemed to move with purpose, forming patterns that tickled the edge of recognition.

She blinked hard and looked away, focusing instead on the station. It was noticeably smaller now, its detailed structure reduced to a bright cruciform shape against the black. She thought she could see movement—the emergency airlock opening perhaps, a rescue attempt being mounted. But distance and imagination could play tricks on the eyes, especially in space where there was no atmosphere to provide scale or context.

A red light began flashing on her heads-up display. The radio was detecting a signal, but when she activated the receiver, what came through wasn't Chen's reassuring voice or Mission Control's professional calm. It was a sound that had no business existing in the vacuum of space—a deep, resonant tone that seemed to bypass her ears entirely and vibrate directly in her skull.

Martinez quickly shut off the radio. The sound stopped, but she could feel an echo of it lingering in her bones, like the memory of a bass note played too loud. She looked back at the Earth, and for a moment—just a moment—she could have sworn she saw something massive moving beneath the clouds, something that made white thunderheads look like foam on the surface of a much deeper sea.

II. The First Hours

The Earth hung below her like a marble wrapped in wispy cotton, impossibly distant. She'd seen it a thousand times through the station's windows, but now it felt different. Wrong. The longer she stared, the more it seemed to pulse and shift, as if something vast was stirring beneath those clouds. The terminator line between day and night appeared to writhe, like the edge of an enormous eyelid slowly closing.

Martinez had always prided herself on her psychological resilience. The NASA screening process was rigorous—countless hours of isolation tanks, stress tests, psychological evaluations. She'd scored in the 99th percentile for stress tolerance. ""Like a submarine made of diamond,"" her evaluator had written. Now that submarine was developing hairline cracks, and the pressure outside was infinite.

She began her survival checklist, the procedures drilled into her through countless simulations. The rhythmic nature of the checks was supposed to be calming, grounding. Instead, each system verification felt like reading her own eulogy.

Primary oxygen supply: 7 hours, 42 minutes remaining.

Secondary oxygen supply: 47 minutes emergency reserve.

Suit pressure: 14.7 PSI, nominal.

Temperature regulation: 98.6°F, nominal.

Power systems: 91% capacity.

Communication systems: Signal null.

Location beacon: Active, broadcasting.

Maneuvering fuel: 12% remaining.

Everything functioned with a mechanical perfection that felt obscene against the abnormality of her situation. The suit was designed to keep her alive, but in doing so, it had created a tiny pocket of habitability in an environment that rejected human life with absolute indifference. She was, in essence, living inside a high-tech coffin.

The sun emerged from behind the Earth's limb, and Martinez activated her helmet's polarizing filter. The light seemed different out here, away from the station's protective bulk. Sharper. More hostile. The rays carried information her eyes couldn't quite process, like a language written in photons and radiation.

She tried the radio again, cycling through all frequencies. Static answered her, but within its hiss, she began to hear patterns. Not voices, exactly, but something that suggested communication—like listening to a conversation in a language so foreign that the brain couldn't even recognize it as speech. The patterns seemed to repeat every 4.7 seconds. She knew this because she began counting, using her suit's chronometer for precision. Always 4.7 seconds. The exact time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to Saturn at their closest approach.

That fact surfaced in her mind unbidden, and she couldn't remember if it was true or if her brain was already manufacturing coincidences to create meaning from meaninglessness. She'd studied astronomical distances extensively during her training, but now the numbers felt like they were concealing something. As if the true distances between celestial bodies could only be measured in units of consciousness rather than space.

The suit's temperature remained steady, but Martinez felt cold. Not the physical cold of space—her thermal regulation was functioning perfectly—but a deeper cold that seemed to emanate from the void itself. It was the cold of vast distances, of thoughts too large for human minds to contain.

She looked at her hands, floating before her in their armored gloves. The material was a marvel of engineering: multiple layers of protection against vacuum, radiation, and micrometeorite impacts. But as she watched, the shadows on the gloves' surface began to move strangely, forming patterns that reminded her of the static on her radio. She blinked, and the patterns disappeared, but she could still feel them there, like afterimages burned into her retinas.

A slight movement caught her attention. One of her suit's external sensor packages had rotated slightly on its mounting. She hadn't touched it. There was no air resistance here, no force that could have moved it. And yet she watched as it rotated another fraction of a degree, its metal surface catching the sunlight at an angle that sent a lance of pain through her left eye.

Martinez looked back at the Earth. The Atlantic was visible now, a vast expanse of blue that didn't look like water anymore. It looked like something fluid was moving beneath the surface, something that operated on principles far removed from terrestrial oceanography. The cloud patterns over the Amazon had arranged themselves into what appeared to be mathematical equations, but they described geometries that couldn't exist in three-dimensional space.

She tried to remember her training about spatial disorientation and vacuum-induced hallucinations. The mind, they'd told her, will create patterns where none exist. It's a survival mechanism, an attempt to impose order on chaos. But what if the opposite were true? What if their perceived chaos was actually a pattern too vast to comprehend, and their ordered universe was the real hallucination?

The sun glinted off something in the distance—probably a piece of space debris, though it seemed to move in a way that violated Kepler's laws of orbital mechanics. As she watched, it appeared to fold in on itself, collapsing into geometries that her eyes refused to process. The sight sent a wave of vertigo through her that the suit's gyroscopes couldn't compensate for.

Her suit's clock showed that only forty-three minutes had passed since the tether broke. That couldn't be right. She'd lived lifetimes in those minutes, watched civilizations rise and fall in the cloud patterns below. Time itself seemed to be becoming unreliable, stretching and contracting like a living thing.

She tried the radio one final time, more out of ritual than hope. The static had changed again. Now it reminded her of breathing—not human breathing, but the respiration of something that measured its breaths in centuries. Between the pulses of static, she heard what might have been words:

""...watching...""

""...always...""

""...between...""

Martinez shut off the radio with trembling fingers. The silence that followed was not the absence of sound, but rather its opposite—a presence so profound that it made sound itself seem like a crude approximation of something far more fundamental.

She pulled up her suit's diagnostic programs and began running every test in the system. The numbers and procedures were comforting in their mundanity, even as a part of her mind whispered that mathematics itself was just a tiny subset of something far larger and more terrible. She needed to stay focused. Needed to remain human for as long as possible.

Because increasingly, she was beginning to suspect that human consciousness was not the default state of the universe. It was an anomaly, a brief spark in an infinite darkness that thought in ways that would drive her mad if she began to understand them.

Six hours of oxygen remained. Six hours until her body joined the other debris orbiting the Earth. But as she watched the shadows lengthening impossibly across her suit's surface, Martinez wondered if her mind would survive that long.

III. The Descent

By hour three, Martinez began to notice the silence. Not just the absence of sound—her own heartbeat and breathing were loud enough in the suit—but something deeper. A silence that pressed against her mind like a physical weight, as if the vacuum itself was trying to crush her thoughts into a singularity of consciousness.

She had experienced silence before, of course. The anechoic chamber during training, the quiet hours on night shift aboard the station, the desert stillness of her childhood home in New Mexico. But this was different. Those silences had been an absence. This was a presence.

The suit's ambient noise became a symphony of reminders that she was still alive: the soft whir of the oxygen circulation system, the periodic click of the carbon dioxide scrubbers, the subtle hum of the power cells. She began to catalog these sounds, giving them names and personalities. The scrubber became Manuel, steady and reliable like her grandfather. The circulation system was Sarah, her daughter, always moving, always dancing. The power cell's hum she named after her wife, Helena—a constant source of energy and life.

She started talking to herself, at first just status checks and oxygen levels, then stream-of-consciousness rambling about her life. She spoke of her childhood in New Mexico, of watching the stars with her father's telescope. How he'd taught her the constellations, his weathered hand pointing out patterns in the sky while crickets chirped in the desert night. She talked about her first spacewalk, how she'd wept at the beauty of it, though she'd never admitted that to the psychologists during her debriefing.

But even her voice began to sound strange, distorted. The words seemed to hang in the air inside her helmet, twisting into shapes that weren't quite language anymore. She watched as her breath fogged the inside of her visor in patterns that reminded her of the Mandelbrot set, fractals spiraling into infinity before fading away.

""My name is Carmen Martinez,"" she said, trying to anchor herself in facts. ""I am a Senior Engineer aboard the Helios Station. I have a wife named Helena and a daughter named Sarah. I am currently experiencing psychological stress due to isolation and spatial disorientation.""

The words felt hollow, rehearsed. Was that really her voice? It seemed to echo strangely, as if coming from very far away or perhaps from somewhere much too close—from inside her skull rather than her throat.

The stars had changed. She knew, intellectually, that she was seeing the same constellations she'd mapped as a child, but they looked wrong now. Orion's belt appeared to have four stars instead of three. The Big Dipper's handle curved in a way that violated Euclidean geometry. When she blinked, the patterns shifted, forming connections that suggested purpose—as if the stars were nodes in some vast neural network, processing thoughts too enormous for human comprehension.

She remembered a paper she'd read during her doctoral studies about stellar distribution patterns. The mathematician had proposed that the apparent randomness of star positions actually contained encoded information, like a cosmic version of steganography. The paper had been dismissed as fringe science, its author's career effectively ended. Now, watching the constellations rearrange themselves when she wasn't looking directly at them, Martinez wondered if the mathematician had gone mad not because he was wrong, but because he was right.

Her suit's chronometer marked three hours and twenty-seven minutes since the separation. The oxygen gauge showed just under five hours remaining, but the numbers seemed to flutter and dance, occasionally replacing themselves with symbols that belonged to no known mathematical system. She began counting her breaths, trying to calculate her oxygen consumption rate, but kept losing track around number seventeen, as if something was gently pulling her thoughts away from anything too rigidly logical.

The Earth had completed another third of its rotation beneath her. The Mediterranean was visible now, its blue waters looking less like an ocean and more like an aperture into something deeper. The currents moved in ways that water shouldn't, forming spiral patterns that made her think of DNA helixes, but twisted through dimensions she couldn't quite perceive.

Martinez tried reciting the periodic table, another attempt to hold onto rational thought. ""Hydrogen, atomic number one. Helium, atomic number two. Lithium..."" She stopped at carbon. The sixth element. Carbon, the basis of all known life. But why carbon? The question suddenly seemed intensely important. Out of all the elements that could have formed the backbone of terrestrial biochemistry, why had carbon been chosen? And who—or what—had done the choosing?

She looked at her gloved hands again, thinking about the carbon atoms in her own body. Each one had been forged in the heart of a dying star, blown out into space by supernovas, collected by gravity into planets, and eventually assembled into her consciousness. But what if that process wasn't as random as science suggested? What if those carbon atoms carried memories of their stellar origins, and human consciousness was just a tiny eddy in a much larger flow of cosmic awareness?

""Focus,"" she said aloud. ""Focus on the concrete."" But what was concrete out here? Einstein had proven that space and time were relative, that the apparently solid foundation of reality was actually as fluid as a dream. And in dreams, anything could happen. Anything could be true.

She noticed that she had begun to salivate excessively, a physiological response to extreme stress. The droplets of saliva floated in her helmet, catching the starlight. Each droplet seemed to contain an entire universe, galaxies spiraling in the surface tension. She watched, mesmerized, as one droplet split into two, then four, then eight, dividing like cells but following patterns that cellular mitosis had never imagined.

The suit's temperature regulation system clicked on, responding to her elevated body heat. The sound startled her, and for a moment, she forgot where she was. Was she floating in space, or was space floating in her? The distinction suddenly seemed meaningless. She remembered reading about the homunculus argument in philosophy—the idea that if there was a little person in your head watching your sensory inputs like a movie, there would have to be an even smaller person in that person's head, and so on ad infinitum. But what if it wasn't infinity that waited at the end of that regression? What if it was something else, something that watched and thought and dreamed in ways that made human consciousness look like a candle flame next to a supernova?

Her training had included exercises for maintaining psychological stability in isolation. Count backward from one hundred. Focus on your breathing. Think about loved ones. But these techniques assumed a reality that played by human rules. Out here, surrounded by infinite nothing that was beginning to feel more and more like infinite everything, human psychology seemed as quaint and limited as an abacus in a quantum computing lab.

""My name is Carmen Martinez,"" she tried again, but the words came out wrong, as if she were speaking them backward and forward simultaneously. She could feel her grasp on human identity beginning to slip, like trying to hold onto a soap bubble that was expanding into dimensions she couldn't perceive.

The stars continued their impossible dance, and in their movement, she began to see patterns that reminded her of neurons firing in a cosmic brain. Each stellar fusion reaction was a thought, each gravitational wave a memory, each quantum fluctuation a dream. And humanity, with all its science and mathematics and carefully constructed models of reality, was just a fleeting synapse in that vast consciousness.

Four hours of oxygen remained. Or was it five? The numbers on her display had begun to move in ways that suggested time itself was becoming unreliable. Martinez closed her eyes, but that only made things worse. In the darkness behind her eyelids, she could see things moving, vast shapes that seemed to be composed of angles that couldn't exist in normal space-time.

When she opened her eyes again, the whispers had begun.",3,1734207196.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
