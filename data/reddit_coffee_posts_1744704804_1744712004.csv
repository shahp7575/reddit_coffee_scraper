Due to war and national affairs, they have shortage in basic things, national trade is in huge decline (if not completely eliminated) and that is why Lawrence (even Fred) have been trying so hard to appeal to other countries, in order for them to open their trade borders.

In the upcoming future, Gilead's lack of basic things continues, well into the years of its establishment. We have witnessed that food (oranges,coffee, cinamon, meat) basic drugs, basic health hygiene, cloths are in lack. And yes I know that a lot of it, is Gilead's fault for destroying them or due to environmental pollution - but did you noticed that in Canada's super markets, everything seemed to be in efficiency?

## Key Features Analysis

The top laptop trays of 2025 are distinguished by several key features that enhance user experience and functionality.

Many models offer a wide range of height adjustments, from a few inches above a desk to over a foot, allowing users to find the perfect viewing angle whether they are sitting or standing. Angle adjustments, often controlled by ratcheting mechanisms or smooth tilting platforms, ensure that the laptop screen is always at an eye-level position.

**Sturdy Construction and Weight Capacity:** A robust frame and durable materials are essential for a stable and reliable laptop tray.High-quality trays typically feature aluminum alloy frames, solid wood surfaces, or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic, providing exceptional strength and longevity. The weight capacity is a critical factor to consider, especially for users with larger or heavier laptops. Top-rated trays can support laptops weighing up to 17 inches, ensuring that your device remains secure and stable during use.

**Integrated Cooling System:** Overheating can significantly impact laptop performance and longevity. To combat this issue, many advanced laptop trays incorporate integrated cooling systems. these systems often include built-in fans powered by USB,which actively dissipate heat away from the laptop's base,preventing thermal throttling and ensuring optimal performance during intensive tasks. Additionally, some trays feature ventilated surfaces with strategically placed perforations to promote natural airflow and further reduce heat buildup.

 ## Core Benefits

Choosing a top-tier sublimation printing shop offers several significant benefits that enhance the overall customer experience and the quality of the final product.

This makes the printed images highly durable and able to withstand repeated washing, wear, and exposure to the elements. The long-lasting nature of sublimation prints ensures that personalized items remain vibrant and attractive for an extended period.

 ## FAQs Section

Navigating the world of sublimation printing can raise several questions. Here are answers to some common inquiries.

**What file formats are accepted for sublimation printing?**
   Most sublimation printing shops accept a variety of file formats, including JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and PDF. Vector-based formats like AI and EPS are often preferred for designs that require scalability without loss of quality. It's always best to check with the specific shop to confirm their preferred file formats and resolution requirements.

**Can I sublimate on any type of fabric?**
   Sublimation printing works best on polyester fabrics or polyester blends with a high polyester content. Natural fibers like cotton do not bond well with sublimation dyes, resulting in faded or washed-out prints. Some shops offer pre-treated cotton fabrics that are specifically designed for sublimation, but polyester remains the ideal choice for optimal results.

**How long does a sublimation print typically last?**
   Sublimation prints are highly durable and can last for many years with proper care. The dyes are infused directly into the material, creating a permanent bond that is resistant to fading, cracking, and peeling. To maximize the lifespan of a sublimation print, it is recommended to wash items inside out in cold water and avoid harsh detergents or bleach.

**What is the typical turnaround time for a sublimation printing order?**
   The turnaround time for a sublimation printing order can vary depending on the complexity of the design, the quantity of items, and the shop's current workload. Simple orders with readily available materials may be completed within a few days, while more complex projects or large quantities may take a week or longer. Always confirm the estimated turnaround time with the shop before placing your order.

* üì≤ Trying to send a massive .MOV file to a friend via WhatsApp  
* üì∫ Playing back a high-quality MKV file on a media player that only speaks MP4  
* üñ•Ô∏è Uploading to platforms that only accept specific formats like .MP4 or .WEBM  
* üìÅ Compressing large files for sharing while preserving quality  

And of course, every time someone in my life says:

# ‚úÖ Step-By-Step: How to Change a Video‚Äôs File Type

Alright, let‚Äôs break down the tools and see how we can bring that creative magic to life.

# Method 1: Online Converters (For Quick Fixes)

Online converters are great when:

* You‚Äôre only converting one or two files  
* You don‚Äôt want to install anything  
* You don‚Äôt need any fancy features

How to use them:

1. Visit a site like **CloudConvert**, **Zamzar**, or **Convertio**  
2. Upload your video file  
3. Choose the output format (like MP4, MOV, etc.)  
4. Hit **Convert** and download the result

üü¢ Pros:

* Easy and free  
* Works on any device with a browser

üî¥ Cons:

* File size limits  
* Privacy concerns (your video is uploaded to a server)  
* No control over bitrate, resolution, or audio settings  

üí° **Pro Tip:** Avoid public Wi-Fi when uploading sensitive video content.

# Method 2: VLC Media Player (Yes, You Can Even Convert with It!)

You might already have VLC installed without realizing it‚Äôs a hidden gem for converting files.

How to convert video format with VLC:

1. Open VLC and go to **Media > Convert/Save**  
2. Add the video you want to convert  
3. Click **Convert/Save**  
4. Choose the format (MP4, H.264, etc.)  
5. Click **Start** to begin conversion

üü¢ Pros:

* Free and open-source  
* No file size limits  
* Supports lots of obscure formats

üî¥ Cons:

* Not user-friendly for beginners  
* Limited preset options  
* No batch conversion (unless you like scripting)

# Method 3: Movavi Video Converter (My Go-To When Things Get Messy)

When online tools crash or VLC gets moody, I open Movavi.

It‚Äôs not the only solution, but it‚Äôs a reliable one I‚Äôve used when clients sent me mystery-format footage 10 minutes before a deadline.

How I use it:

1. Install and launch Movavi Video Converter  
2. Drag-and-drop my files  
3. Choose a preset or manually select format and resolution  
4. Click **Convert** and let it do the heavy lifting

üü¢ Pros:

* Super clean interface (even my mom gets it)  
* Batch conversion (convert multiple videos while you make coffee)  
* Built-in editing tools (trim, crop, etc.)

üî¥ Cons:

* Not free (but there‚Äôs a trial version)  
* Desktop only (the features of the web version are limited)

# Method 4: HandBrake (For the Nerds Who Like Sliders)

HandBrake is an open-source converter that feels like driving stick shift. If you know what you‚Äôre doing, it‚Äôs glorious. If not, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ educational.

How to change video format with HandBrake:

1. Download HandBrake for Windows/Mac/Linux  
2. Import your video  
3. Choose a preset (or tweak everything manually)  
4. Hit **Start** or **Start Queue** for simultaneous multi-file conversion

üü¢ Pros:

* Fine control over every setting (bitrate, resolution, codec)  
* Great for compressing large videos  
* Totally free

üî¥ Cons:

* No support for some input formats (e.g., DRM-protected files)  
* Can overwhelm beginners

# üéõÔ∏è Important Settings That Affect Output Quality

When I first started converting videos, I treated the export window like a ‚Äúclick and pray‚Äù situation. I‚Äôd scroll through unfamiliar options ‚Äì bitrate, resolution, codecs ‚Äì and blindly hit convert, hoping for the best. Sometimes it worked. Other times, I‚Äôd end up with a blurry mess or a bloated file that wouldn‚Äôt upload anywhere. Eventually, I stopped guessing and started paying attention. Here's what actually matters.

First, let‚Äôs talk **resolution**. This is the foundation of visual clarity. If your original video is in 1080p and you downscale to 480p, expect fuzziness. But here‚Äôs the twist ‚Äì upscaling doesn‚Äôt add magic detail. A 480p video won‚Äôt suddenly become sharp if you convert it to 4K. It‚Äôll just take up more space. The rule of thumb I now follow? Match the resolution to the platform you're uploading to, and don‚Äôt inflate unnecessarily.

Next is **bitrate**, which controls how much data your video uses per second. Higher bitrate means better quality ‚Äì but also bigger files. If you're converting for YouTube or social media, moderate bitrates usually strike a good balance. But for archiving, presentations, or anything you‚Äôll watch on a big screen, crank it up. I‚Äôve found that bitrate matters more than resolution when it comes to visual richness.

Then there‚Äôs **codec selection**. This one tripped me up the most. H.264 is the gold standard for most platforms, but I once used HEVC (H.265) thinking it was an upgrade ‚Äì only to find that my friend‚Äôs laptop couldn‚Äôt play the video without special software. Choose your codec based on where the video is going. If compatibility is key, stick with H.264. If file size is your enemy and you know your audience has modern devices, HEVC can be a lifesaver.

And don‚Äôt forget **frame rate**. I‚Äôve seen good videos ruined because they were converted to a lower frame rate that made them look jittery. Match it to your source unless you have a good reason not to.

The more I paid attention to these settings, the fewer conversion disasters I had to deal with. These days, I tweak each option intentionally instead of relying on default presets ‚Äì and my videos look way better for it.

# üîÑ Wait‚Ä¶ Is Changing Format Always Necessary?

Short answer: **No.**

Before hitting ‚Äúconvert,‚Äù ask yourself:

* Do you *actually* need to convert, or can you use a different media player?  
* Are you losing quality for no reason?  
* Will the converted file still meet your goals (streaming, sharing, uploading)?

Sometimes, the better solution is downloading a better media player or editing software that supports your original format.

# üí° Pro Tips for Flawless Conversions

üéØ Don‚Äôt rename file extensions manually (like .mov ‚Üí .mp4). That won‚Äôt actually convert the format ‚Äì it just confuses your system.

üéØ Test a short clip first before converting a huge file. Saves time if settings go wrong.

üéØ Use descriptive filenames for output (e.g., myfile\_720p.mp4). Trust me, your future self will thank you.

üéØ Back up your original files. Corrupt conversions happen.

üéØ Don‚Äôt expect miracles. A blurry 240p .WMV won‚Äôt magically become 4K by converting it to MP4.

# üß† Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

‚ùå ‚ÄúWhy is there no audio?‚Äù üéØ Check that your output format supports audio, and the audio track is enabled.

‚ùå ‚ÄúMy file is massive after converting!‚Äù üéØ Lower the bitrate or resolution, or try a codec like H.265 (if supported).

‚ùå ‚ÄúConverted file won‚Äôt play on my TV.‚Äù üéØ Check your TV‚Äôs supported formats ‚Äì MP4 is safest, but check codec too (H.264 vs. H.265 matters).

# üîö Final Thoughts: Changing Formats Isn‚Äôt About Tech ‚Äì It‚Äôs About Compatibility

If there's one thing I‚Äôve learned from converting videos at 2 a.m. before a deadline ‚Äì or while trying to help a family member open a mystery format on a six-year-old tablet ‚Äì it‚Äôs this: **knowing how to change a video file type isn‚Äôt just a ‚Äútechie‚Äù skill. It‚Äôs a modern survival tool.**

I used to think file formats were rigid ‚Äì something only editors or engineers needed to worry about. But now I see them more like dialects. One device speaks .MOV, another understands .MP4, and your platform of choice might insist on .WEBM like it‚Äôs the only language that matters. Once you learn how to ‚Äútranslate,‚Äù your content flows across screens without drama.

Oh ‚Äì and don‚Äôt feel guilty if you mess it up once or twice. I once converted a full-length project into a format my editing software didn‚Äôt support, and only realized it halfway through a render. Lesson learned.

Got any conversion horror stories or tips I should know about? Share them below ‚Äì someone else might need that trick you figured out the hard way.

  
There‚Äôs a strange turning point in every tech-savvy person‚Äôs life when a parent sends you a panicked message like:

‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt this video play on my phone?! I just want to watch the baby laughing!‚Äù

And just like that, you‚Äôre knee-deep in explaining video file formats to someone who still refers to their tablet as ‚Äúthe Facebook machine.‚Äù

That was the day I realized that **understanding how to change video file types** isn‚Äôt just for editors and content creators ‚Äì it‚Äôs for anyone who‚Äôs ever tried to move a video from one device to another without watching it morph into a black screen or a ‚Äòfile not supported‚Äô error.

Since then, I‚Äôve converted more files than I can count ‚Äì from MKVs that won‚Äôt play on smart TVs to MOVs that won‚Äôt upload anywhere. And I‚Äôm here to pass on the sanity-saving lessons.

# üìº First, What Even Is a Video Format?

Before we jump into *how to change video file type*, here‚Äôs a one-sentence crash course:

A video format is just a fancy container that holds your video, audio, and sometimes subtitles in a way that different platforms can read (or reject).

Think of it like a suitcase: an MP4 is like a carry-on that fits almost anywhere. A MOV? That‚Äôs a luxury trunk Apple loves and others politely decline. MKV? It‚Äôs the duffel bag stuffed with extras. The wrong ‚Äúsuitcase,‚Äù and your video trip gets delayed.

# ‚öôÔ∏è When Do You Need to Change Formats?

Here‚Äôs when I‚Äôve personally needed to **change a video format**:

I‚Äôm [24M] working at a big company. There‚Äôs this woman [30F] from another department I‚Äôve gotten to know over time ‚Äî mostly through random chats at the coffee machine or on the train.

Since then, I‚Äôve realized I really like her ‚Äî she‚Äôs smart, funny, full of energy, and I genuinely enjoy being around her (which hasn‚Äôt been the case in past relationships).

They are each abusive in their own ways. But my main abuser for all of my life has been my mother. Mentally and emotionally mainly. She used to beat me and we used to have actual fights when i was younger but shes stopped doing that know. When I was 12 or so she threatened to rape me while we were alone, then she started crawling towards me. When i told my family they didn‚Äôt do anything, and instead made me feel horrible because I brought it up at a bad time. She also threatened to rape my older brother when he was younger as well. My entire family hates me and has 100% negativity towards me while still saying ‚Äúthey love me‚Äù. I am constantly told ‚Äúyou will be nothing‚Äù ‚Äúyour insane‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a bad person‚Äù ‚Äúyou deserve nothing‚Äù ‚Äúyour gonna be a failure‚Äù . My mom told me that i was gonna be selling my body for drugs like my father was doing. (I never seen him since like i was a baby)My mother had me believe that she didnt know where my father was but that he was probably dead, turns out hes alive and i guess has been trying to see how I was doing or something. My mom probably messeges him lies about me, but im not really tripping about that. For the past like 3 years I have tried to not speak at all to my family especially my mother,keeping in headphones or not looking or paying attention. My mother has threatened to kill me and my entire family more times than i can count, mostly years ago though. Still she tells me shes gonna kill me sometimes, probably more than once a week. She has pushed my grandma over. She has ATTEMPTED to kill my grandma, me, and my sister years ago by spilling boiling hot coffee on my grandma while she was driving on the highway which caused us to swerve and get within inches of a bad accident. She has pulled my grandmas hair while driving years ago. She has gotten the cops called on her years ago. She has been naked through the house years ago. She screams 24/7 at me and my family. Shes disgusting and doesn‚Äôt wash her hands(neither does most my family). My entire house is a pig sty, which i have given up on cleaning because i am the only one that tries to keep it together other than people SOMETIMES cleaning counters or doing dishes. I have asked to go to therapy but she wont let me.There is so much more and I am only covering my mom here, but the point is HOW DO I GET OUT OF THIS SITUATION. Ive delt with this for too long. I have tried SO SO SO LONG to still be productive, grow as a person, improve, but its so difficult when my environment is so so so harmful and abusive. I have so much trauma that gets inflamed each and every day. I feel like a zombie, like my brain is made of mush and I am dumb. Like im forgetful, everything is blurry,(including my vision which is crazy. Like literally my vision gets blurry. And i have good eyesight too), like im numb. I need this cancer out of my life. I have had suicidal thoughts before but i wont ever actually do it, but I need to change my environment. I NEED to get my mother out of the house. I don‚Äôt know if i should call the police and say that I don‚Äôt feel safe because she threatend to kill me, which might not work because im like 98% she wouldn‚Äôt actually try(anymore). Maybe like CPS or something, but at the same time i want to still be able to live with my dog and also play basketball for my school and be with my friends and stuff. I dont know if CPS would even work since im not in danger. Maybe I should just try to sell that I really do think my mom would kill me. Given all the things that shes done in the past it wouldn‚Äôt be that unbelievable.

1jznxew,https://i.redd.it/jpylln5w0zue1.jpeg,"BFP, 1#IUI, after 26 cycles. Symptoms after IUI and triggertesting","
34F and 33M, trying for almost 2 years. Light pcos symptoms since I have lots of eggs and high amh but all values look good. His sperm looks great too. Sporty, bmi 18.5.

*IUI journey*
I went in at day 3 of the cycle I would start iui, I got an echo 12 eggs on right and 15 left. I got 50 ovaleap for day 3-11 which I had to inject at home in my leg or stomach and a trigger injection for day 12, to inject on a specific time. The injections gave impressive bruises and I found them painful in the stomach so I opted for leg injection. 
Day 8 and 10 and 12 I went to the hospital since my eggs where many and they didn't want to over stimulate, so I got a really low dose of ovaleap, but in reality they reacted slowly. They asked me to come back on these days to see how it progressed. 

On day 12 with 6.4 lining and 1 egg of 19mm I got the trigger at 20.

 42 hours later they did the insemination. The insemination was a whole thing since my uterus muscle was very tight and she could not get the straw in, also my uterus was tilted. Took ages, not very comfortable but not very painful either. Most painfull was the speculum that has to be put on the mouth of the uterus to open it a bit. 

After the iui I was bloated and had light cramping for 2 days. 

*pregnancy symptoms*
I started with having painful breasts on both sides at the same time. When I biked and went over a bump they felt heavy and painful. Then I smelled my cats puke from the couch, disliked the taste of banana and coffee and had to pee more often during the night. Even if I didn't drink my 0.4l tea the night before I always had to pee 3 times.
At day 5-7 dpiui I was so tired, I couldnt walk home from work and had to leave work early. I usually swim 2k 2-4 a week so this was very very weird. I thought it was the hsg trigger hormone. 
During day 7-9 dpiui I felt weird like I was going to get my period, cramps bloated and weird kind of hot flashes and cramps around my stomach. I thought I was gonna get my period 100% early!
But day 8 I didn't have any line (iui trigger gone) and day 10 I saw my line and day 11 it's a dark line.
At day 12 I am so bloated I don't fit my pants anymore. Day 13 I sleep badly because I'm so afraid of my period, have nausea and backacke, but a fat line appears. 

My first positive! Let's hope it sticks! 
It took me 2 years, 26cycles and 1 iui with 50 ovaleap",2,1744710774.0,IUILadies,0,1.0,False

The only thing is that we don‚Äôt necessarily need to see everything, as some things are just not as interesting to us as other things, and in the same time we would like to determine our own pace and stop for snacks, coffee or lunch whenever we want or whenever we see a nice place to do so.

Long story short; I‚Äôm looking for a downloadable or online do-it-yourself guide with highlights of the city, with all the fun facts that you would expect from a tour.

We‚Äôre all human. We all struggle. Life isn‚Äôt always perfect; there are days when we feel accomplished and days when we can barely get anything

done and that‚Äôs okay.

I used to be harsh with myself, blaming and punishing my body for things that weren‚Äôt its fault. I kept searching for quick fixes, forgetting that there‚Äôs a higher power guiding everything, even the things we don‚Äôt understand.

One day, I came across a podcast. The episode was about self-blame how we often abandon ourselves for things that are long gone or haven‚Äôt even happened yet. It spoke about overthinking the past, regretting its loss, and being deeply attached to what‚Äôs no longer here. It also touched on the constant fear of an unknown future and the anxiety it brings.

The message was clear and simple:¬†Your body is a gift. Take care of it with love.

Ease the heaviness of your days by watching a comedy, or an animated movie, or by listening to soft music filled with warmth and love. Sip your coffee or tea in a peaceful corner, far from the noise of racing thoughts. Read a book, paint something, write your heart out‚Äîdo anything that keeps you rooted in the present, without clinging to the past or fearing what‚Äôs ahead.

Pamper your body. Take a refreshing shower, put on simple yet elegant clothes, nourish yourself with good food and restful sleep. Go for a walk with yourself, observe life and nature, cook a healthy meal just for you, and savor it slowly.

Let go of the past it won‚Äôt come back. And don‚Äôt exhaust yourself worrying about a future that hasn‚Äôt arrived. Let life be soft and simple. Let go of the perfection we see on social media, and instead, enjoy the raw beauty of living gently, with a routine that feels right for your soul.",1,1744710441.0,u_TopLack962,0,1.0,False

Description: *Okay you guys; can three adults, sharp-sighted and ""good girls"" be this giggly without being heckled? After an unreasonably early morning in SVTS's morning studio, we try to land in our possible coolness, queues and what the dating climate really looks like. We don't apologize - yet. But yes, sorry for the giggles.*

The podcast starts with them giggling and laughing. They are so goofy y'all ü§™

They woke up 04.00 to be in Swedish TV. Rachel thought of SVT when already creating the podcast. She says it's 'the first media performance', as if they'll have many more? The delusion. 

Mikaela is offended that her title was only 'podcaster'. She wants to be taken seriously, because she's also a Matchmaker. 

Rachel jokes that Olivia is a big shopper. 
Olivia is like, no? You are, because you take 15 stuff into the changing room, and then finds more stuff on the way to the cashier. 

They talk about online shopping, Rachel says she would never return a package. Too much work. 

Rachel thinks she's cool. Mikaela says she's got a cool factor but can't play it cool. 

Rachel is laughing, cutting off the others and has lame jokes. She wants to secretly join one of Mikaela's dates, just to spy. When Olivia was single, Rachel used her Tinder to be 'funny' with guys on there. For example replying to guys I LOVE WATER SLIDES. She so quirky. Rachel laughs a lot. 

Mikaela is like a wet blanket and talks about how bad dating life is. I zoned out because she's speaking with a monotone voice. 

Rachel jokes that Olivia skipped a queue, in front of an old lady. Olivia said no, I didn't do it on purpose, that was a mistake. 

Rachel talks about lines. She wouldn't skip the line in front of anyone, but if she knew someone who could let her skip it - she would take benefit of that. 

Mikaela points out that she was like this before getting famous too. 

Olivia's mother has a very famous bacery at their small summer place, with lots of people lining up. Olivia stands at the back of the line even if she's the owner's daughter. 

Rachel says that Lea skipped the line and just took a bun, saying 'I know the owner's daughter' last summer, with no hesitation. Rachel thinks it's very funny. 

Olivia says the reason why she lines up, is that the staff doesn't always know who she is and doesn't want to stand there and explain it to people. Rachel laughs and say she LOVES to do stuff like that. Olivia says she also lines up because it's more important with the paying customers, and if she wants coffee etc, she feels it's more fair to line up. 

Rachel says she likes to skip the line in these kind of situations, and enjoys the moment when she can just say 'hiiii I'm friends with the owner, I'll just grab 6 buns and sit over there okay?'. 

(I would probably skip the line if I were Olivia, by taking the back door, but Rachel sounds like an entitled brat that everyone hates.) 

Rachel outs her DHL-guy, who gives her packages to Denis, as he knows they're married. Mikaela is like üëÄthat's against the law, and Rachel is going to get him fired. Rachel says it's because she never opens her mail and forgets to go get her packages, and it's probably the reason why DHL wants to get rid of them. They take up space and cost them money to send it back. 

Rachel says Olivia says needs to take up more space, and make people uncomfortable. Rachel loves to do that, ruffling people's feathers. For example sending back food that's not good enough, or taking the benefit of skipping lines. 

They're trying to get Olivia to skip a line, at for example Starbucks 08.00 in the morning. Just to take up more space. 

Rachel hates the culture in Sweden, where you're not allowed to take up space or break the norm. She despises lines.  

Mikaela says Rachel is a diva. 

Rachel is laughing and giggling, and finally the podcast is over.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.

And tbh, I can understand why. VG10, smooth axis on bearings, cool shape and style, and a whole ass $27! Great knife so far, out of the package about an hour ago. Immediate drawbacks are pretty revealing though. This thing is BLADE HEAVY as can be. The g10 and aluminum liners (even though they‚Äôre weirdly integral) are lighter than one would think, but the blade is a chunker. Not a terrible thing at all if that‚Äôs how you like your blade balance. Other thing that is an easy negative is that the ~1mm of liner that sticks out from the scale on the bottom or finger side of the knife, are sharp as hell. Not a knife I would want to lose a grip on in wet conditions because they‚Äôre easily sharp enough to cut waterlogged hands. But at the end of the day, for less than $30, there‚Äôs not a whole lot to complain about. If you‚Äôre interested, definitely pick one up before they come out with some v2 that costs $60 more.

After going through with the treatment, i can't say much changed, maybe the first 2 weeks it was a little better.

I then lived with it for a year until recently, always having troubles going to WC, going painfully, bloody, with mucosities quite often(which i think was from bursting piles, but idk). 

Because of work, i had been consuming coffee every day,  2-3 cups. And coffee always had the effect of laxatives for me. Before hemhoroids, coffee helped me with going regularly nr2, always liked it, but after hemhoroids appeared, even though i wanted to go nr2, it was impossible to go well, as piles always i flated afterwards. 

Recently, I'd say 1-2 months, i stopped drinking coffee, and oh God, how happy i am. All the problems dissapeared little by little, i can defacate regularly, or at least without pain, blood, pus, or whatever. I do also eat more salads now, but that's off topic, tbh.

Now, i understand we all got different bodies and problems, so this might not be a way out for most people, but if you also drink a lot of coffee, just try to live without it for 2 weeks, check the effect of it.(energy drinks also included here, and i mean 0 drinks, total interdiction).

I hope this will help at least some of you guys, still suffering  ï„Å£‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢ î„Å£",1,1744710087.0,hemorrhoid,0,1.0,False

Practical Marriage Counseling Advice to Strengthen Communication
----------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Healthy communication is the backbone of any strong marriage. When couples struggle to express their feelings or misunderstand each other, it can lead to frustration, resentment, and emotional distance. Practical marriage counseling advice often zeroes in on communication because it‚Äôs a skill couples can improve with intention and practice. If you want to strengthen your bond and resolve conflicts more easily, focusing on communication is a smart place to start.

### Active Listening Builds Trust

One of the simplest yet most powerful ways to improve communication is through active listening. This means truly paying attention when your partner is speaking, rather than planning your response or letting your mind wander. To practice active listening:

- Look at your partner with open body language.
- Ask clarifying questions when you don‚Äôt understand something.
- Repeat back what you heard to confirm you got the message right.
- Focus on understanding their feelings, not just their words.
 
This approach shows your spouse that their thoughts and emotions matter to you. It builds emotional safety, making it easier to share honestly and openly. When both people feel heard, conflicts are less likely to escalate.

### Express Yourself Clearly and Kindly

Many relationship difficulties come from how feelings are expressed. It‚Äôs easy to let frustration turn into blaming or criticizing, which shuts down conversations. Counseling advice encourages couples to use ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements instead of ‚Äúyou‚Äù statements to communicate needs without sounding accusatory. For example:

- Instead of ‚ÄúYou never listen,‚Äù try ‚ÄúI feel hurt when I don‚Äôt feel heard.‚Äù
- Replace ‚ÄúYou always interrupt me‚Äù with ‚ÄúI need a chance to finish my thoughts.‚Äù
 
Clear, kind communication reduces defensiveness and invites cooperation. Remember, your goal is to share your feelings and needs, not to win an argument.

### Set Aside Time to Check In Regularly

Busy schedules and daily distractions can leave couples disconnected, even when no conflict exists. One effective piece of marriage counseling advice is to create a regular habit of checking in with each other. This can be as simple as spending 10‚Äì15 minutes daily to discuss how things are going in your relationship. During this time:

- Share positive moments or appreciation.
- Bring up any concerns gently, before they build up.
- Discuss goals or plans together.
 
These consistent check-ins help maintain a warm connection and catch small issues before they become major problems.

### Recognize and Respect Different Communication Styles

Every person has a unique way of expressing themselves. Your style might be very direct, while your partner might be more reserved or emotional. Understanding these differences is key to better communication. Marriage counseling advice suggests:

- Taking note of when your partner talks more comfortably (such as during a walk or over coffee).
- Being patient if they need time to gather their thoughts before responding.
- Adjusting your approach‚Äîsometimes asking more open questions or giving space during tense moments.
 
Respecting these natural styles prevents misunderstandings and promotes smoother conversations.

### Use Time-Outs to Manage Conflict

Arguments can quickly spiral if emotions become too heated. Practical marriage counseling advice often includes learning how and when to take a timeout. This isn‚Äôt about avoiding problems but about preventing damage during intense moments. Here‚Äôs how to use time-outs effectively:

- Agree as a couple on a signal that means ‚Äúpause.‚Äù
- Step away for at least 20 minutes to cool down and reflect.
- Use the break to breathe deeply, journal your feelings, or do a calming activity.
- Return with the intention to listen and resolve rather than blame.
 
Taking a timeout helps preserve respect and prevents regretful words that can hurt your relationship long-term.

### Encourage Positive Reinforcement and Appreciation

Too often, couples focus only on what‚Äôs wrong instead of celebrating what‚Äôs going well. This can create a negative communication cycle where each partner feels undervalued. Couples counseling advice highlights the power of regular appreciation:

- Express gratitude for small acts of kindness.
- Give genuine compliments about qualities you admire in your spouse.
- Remember to acknowledge progress you make together, even if it‚Äôs slow.
 
Positivity fosters emotional closeness and encourages both partners to communicate from a place of kindness.

### Seek Professional Guidance When Needed

If you find it challenging to break old patterns or handle conflicts on your own, marriage counseling offers expert support. Therapists provide tools tailored to your unique communication challenges and emotional needs. They help you develop skills like conflict resolution, empathy, and emotional regulation.

Remember, asking for help isn‚Äôt a sign of failure. It shows a commitment to strengthening your marriage and protecting your relationship‚Äôs future.

By applying these practical tips for better communication, you can nurture deeper understanding, reduce conflict, and build a more satisfying marriage. Taking small but intentional steps each day will create habits that support open and loving connection for years to come.

</div>Overcoming Common Challenges Through Marriage Counseling Strategies
-------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Understanding the Role of Marriage Counseling Advice

 Marriage counseling advice plays a vital role in helping couples navigate through the challenges that naturally arise in relationships. Whether it‚Äôs communication breakdowns, trust issues, or handling conflict, professional guidance offers couples tools that foster understanding and cooperation. If you find yourself stuck in recurring disputes or feeling disconnected from your partner, marriage counseling advice can provide a fresh perspective and practical strategies tailored just for you.

### Identifying Common Relationship Challenges Couples Face

 To make the most of any marriage counseling advice, it‚Äôs important to recognize the common obstacles that many couples encounter. Some typical issues include:

- **Communication Problems:** Difficulty sharing thoughts and emotions openly and respectfully.
- **Trust and Jealousy:** Concerns stemming from past experiences or misunderstandings.
- **Financial Stress:** Disagreements over spending habits, budgeting, or financial planning.
- **Intimacy Concerns:** Changes in physical or emotional closeness leading to feelings of rejection or loneliness.
- **Parenting Differences:** Conflicting approaches to raising children.
 
 These challenges can strain a marriage, but with effective counseling advice, you can work toward solutions together.

### Practical Strategies Offered by Marriage Counseling Advice

 When you seek marriage counseling advice, you gain access to expert techniques designed to rebuild and strengthen your relationship. Here are some of the most effective strategies often emphasized:

- **Active Listening:** Learn to listen without interrupting, judging, or immediately offering solutions. This approach helps both partners feel heard and valued.
- **Expressing Needs Clearly:** Instead of blaming language like ‚ÄúYou never‚Ä¶,‚Äù counseling advice encourages using ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements such as ‚ÄúI feel‚Ä¶‚Äù to articulate emotions without blame.
- **Setting Boundaries:** Establishing limits that protect emotional safety, respect, and personal space helps prevent resentment from building up.
- **Understanding Emotional Triggers:** Recognizing what sparks negative reactions allows you to respond thoughtfully instead of reacting impulsively.
- **Problem-Solving Together:** Counselors guide couples to cooperate in finding solutions instead of competing or retreating.
- **Rebuilding Trust:** This includes transparency, consistency, and patience while healing from past hurts.
 
### How Counseling Encourages Healthy Communication

 One key takeaway from marriage counseling advice is that communication is not just about talking‚Äîit‚Äôs about connecting. Counselors often use communication exercises designed to deepen empathy and reduce conflict. For example, partners might practice paraphrasing what the other says to confirm understanding. This simple skill can transform tense conversations into moments of genuine connection.

 Additionally, counseling encourages refraining from negative communication habits like sarcasm, accusation, or silent treatments. Instead, a respectful tone and openness create a safe space where both individuals feel free to share without fear of judgment or reprisal.

### Building Emotional Intimacy Through Counseling Guidance

 Emotional intimacy is the glue that holds a marriage together during tough times. Many couples seek marriage counseling advice precisely because they want to rebuild this closeness. Effective counseling strategies focus on rebuilding vulnerability, trust, and affection step by step.

 Simple practices recommended in sessions may include spending uninterrupted quality time together, sharing daily appreciations, or engaging in activities that foster fun and laughter. These small investments in emotional connection can significantly improve your marital bond.

### Practical Tips to Implement Marriage Counseling Advice at Home

 Applying counseling advice outside of sessions is crucial for lasting change. Here are some practical ways to integrate these lessons into your daily life:

- **Schedule Weekly Check-Ins:** Take time to talk about feelings, dreams, and any issues that need attention in a calm setting.
- **Practice Patience:** Change doesn‚Äôt happen overnight. Acknowledge progress, no matter how small.
- **Use ‚ÄúTime-Outs‚Äù Wisely:** If a conversation gets heated, agree on a pause to cool down and revisit later with a clearer mind.
- **Maintain Physical Connection:** Touch, hugs, or holding hands can nurture closeness even when words are hard.
- **Be Honest About Your Needs:** Your partner can‚Äôt meet needs they don‚Äôt know about; clear communication makes understanding possible.
 
### Why Commitment to Counseling Advice Matters

 Counseling advice is only as effective as the commitment you and your partner bring to applying it. It takes courage to face difficult truths and to work together toward improvement. When both individuals intentionally practice these strategies, the relationship can emerge stronger and more resilient.

 Remember, seeking marriage counseling advice is a proactive step toward a healthier, happier partnership‚Äînot a sign of failure. Using these expert techniques helps create a foundation built on trust, respect, and love.

### Finding the Right Marriage Counseling Resources

 Not all counseling advice fits every relationship, so it‚Äôs essential to find professionals or resources that resonate with your unique situation. Look for licensed marriage therapists with positive recommendations or explore books and trusted online resources specializing in marriage counseling. Many couples find value in supplementing their sessions with workbooks or guided exercises to practice at home.

 Ultimately, the goal is to find effective strategies that make you feel supported and empowered as you work through your challenges together.

</div>### Conclusion

Strengthening communication and addressing common challenges are at the heart of successful marriage counseling advice. When couples learn to openly share their feelings and listen without judgment, it creates a safe space for understanding and growth.

1jznqtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jznqtl/is_my_f32_boyfriendm30_stingy/,Is my (F32) boyfriend(M30) stingy?,"TLDR-  
I feel like my boyfriend acts like a girl in the relationship.  
  
 I(F32) have ALWAYS been in relationships where the male is the provider. Even the guys I have dated (younger or older) have always been financial providers. To me, it's normal for the guy to initiate and pay for most things. This does not mean that I do not pay for anything I do pay for things like my own shopping, gifts for him, occasional coffee and dinner etc. I just prefer that a guy offers and pays for it.   
I also understand that there are relationships that are 50/50 but I think he's abit too calculative??  
Am i asking for too much or is my boyfriend stingy and calculative?

Some background information about my past relationship/dates. I was in a 5 year relationship where he would pay for most things like dinner, holidays and gift me things I need. He was not rich when I met him as he was just starting out his car grooming business. A humble suzuki swift and was polishing cars at showrooms at 8am- a labor intense kinda job. I'm not a high maintenance person and we don't go for expensive dinners or travel business class but he always offers to pay for as much as he can. He is not one to gift me material things like luxury bags, luxury clothes but would buy me things I need. Whenever he had to renew a phone plan he would buy me an iphone, he would buy me a camera for work and even a laptop. He gave what he could and when the business got better he hired me to work for him even though my task was minimal and would fly us business class for holidays. In return, i would offer to pay for things when we went out and help him out in the business as much as I could but he would always refuse. we eventually broke up because of differences. 

After that relationship I went on to date 2-3 guys all of which were equally generous. One flew to the country I'm based at and would fly me to see him as well. I would often offer to pay for meals when he was here as he never allowed me to pay for anything when I was in his country. another guy would often bring me out for dinners and never allowed me to pay even when i offered so i settled on paying for drinks without him knowing. 

My boyfriend on the other hand was from a long term relationship of 7 years and met me soon after he broke it off with his ex girlfriend. I am not entirely sure about how their relationship was like but it feels like they were like two friends? 

I say this because in our relationship, it feels like he got comfortable too quickly. It feels like he didnt try to understand my wants and needs and just replaced his ex gf with me. So whatever habits he had he just applied it to me. 

Last year, I had planned a trip with some friends. I asked him if he wanted to come. Initially, i was staying with a friend but since he was coming.. he decided he would book a hotel and I would stay with. him. Once there, he did not offer to book for any of the Grabs( taxi transport) the entire trip. I just thought okay that's fine, maybe he thinks that cos he paid for accommodation i'll pay for transport. but then!! he would always want to split every payment even when I told him its okay, i'll pay for it. this made me feel like he was calculative as the street food was literally less than a dollar. it made more sense to get the next item or just let me pay for it. 

When we went out to meet some friends for drinks, we eventually split the bill at the end of the night and I paid for his share since it was his first time meeting them and I was the one who asked him to come anyway. I didnt mention to him that i paid for it cos yknow its only normal right? 

Fast forward to one night. It was his friend's birthday drinks and he wanted me to come along to meet them for the first time. I agreed and met them. The following day they split the bill and he wanted me to pay my share. I'm more than willing to pay, which I did. I just thought that it would be nice that he offered to pay as he was the one who ask me to meet his friends right?

Our normal routine is if someone pays for lunch the other person would pay for coffee after. What I dont like is, he makes sure that I would pay my share. what i mean by that is when we go for food and coffee he would say "" B, YOU PAY"" when its my turn to pay. Which is fine but would it really hurt if he paid first??

There was an overseas trip with his friends that he wanted to go and I told him to go ahead but I wouldnt go because it didnt make sense for me tos pend that amount of money as I had just started a new job. He agreed. but when his friends ask him why we weren't going, he would tell them "" ask her why she dont want to go"". Upset, I told him about it. I already specifically told him the reason why I couldnt go. Eventually i decided that since he wanted to go so bad I would go ahead with it. He decided that he would pay for my tickets and I thanked him for it. 

My visa didnt get approved before the trip and we had to cancel the ticket. He then told me ""cancellation fee was 60$"" I asked him if he wanted me to pay for it and he said ""it would be nice"". I told him he was calculative and he said ""i bought you the tickets, why can't you just pay $60""

i told him if he wanted to do something nice for me then dont make it seem like i owe him something. I would just pay him the entire cost of the ticket if needed. I also told him that if he wanted to be so calculative that he should give me the half I paid for the hotels. I initially did not ask him for it he is my partner ykknow. there isnt a need to be like ""oh since i didnt go, please give me back the hotel half""  It's really fine cos he can just buy me a souvenir or something. BUT since he pissed me off with the $60 cancellation fee, I just wanted to prove a point. 

I told him that i'll paint him a picture. He buys a patek philip, drives a nice car, stays in a nice house, takes business class but can't pay $60 for his girlfriend? My ex was not well to do at all when I met him, he made his riches over the years and still gave me more than what my bf will. Its obviously not he can't but a conscious decision to be calculative.

I think I've have proven more than one time that i can pay my share of things but I hate the fact that he doesn't even offer or be a gentlemen about it just makes me upset. I could go on and on as there are more stories to share. this is just a general gist of it. I want him to see that it isnt about the money, its about being less calculative about things and just man-ing up.

My friend's have said that maybe he just doesn't know how as he hasn't dated in a long time. He doesn't know the ""dating market"" now. Which might be true but to what extent ? He can be calculative to his friends for all he wants but I am his partner. If this was the standards of his ex gf, her standards are pretty low. But I also get that when they dated, they were pretty young(23) and maybe finances was tight then but it's different now!

My younger sister, ""Daisy"", has been invited over a few times, but never came to visit me, not since 2017 or something (although I've visited her a lot). Daisy is also super busy all the time, especially recently with preparing for her wedding, and her birthday coming up.

My older sister, ""Rose"", and I visit each other frequently. I've invited her over a few months ago and since then we keep planning to meet up but it keeps getting postponed.

A few days ago I asked Rose if she knows when she'll have time, and she said that currently Daisy is visiting her for a week with her bf and they are going to be celebrating Daisy's birthday together. I felt a bit surprised because I hadn't heard from Daisy and thought maybe she wanted to keep things very low key for her birthday this year.

I told Rose that I messaged Daisy weeks ago about her birthday present, where I asked if this was the game she wanted and if she would prefer getting it for Switch or on Steam, and that she still hadn't replied. I asked Rose to maybe please ask her in person about it, so that I'll know what game to get. She said she'll see what she can do.

I then asked if I could also come to the birthday celebration, and Rose said they were planning on going to bars and go shopping, and it didn't sound like something I'd like to do. I then said I would be willing to ride the train over, meet up for a coffee, and then travel back, just to say hello. She also said she'll see what she can do, but there might not be time.

Now both of them haven't gotten back to me at all for almost a week. I thought we had a good relationship but over the last few years it seemed to have gotten so cold between us, I thought it was just part of growing up, but now seeing the two of them still planning to do things together and not inviting me... 

It feels like something is broken, but idk if I'm overreacting. Also I know planning a wedding is stressful and I don't want to cause unnecessary drama. (I'm invited to the wedding though at least)

There was another incident about two months ago where my roommate had a mental health emergency and I was panicking and texting my sisters in between trying to figure out what to do when things went down, it ended well but I was extremely shaken up and afterwards when I asked if they were available to talk they both said ""sorry I have work tomorrow"" ""yeah me too"" and stopped responding (it was 10 pm). 

I felt a bit abandoned in that moment but Rose has apologized for this since, though, and I thought things would be good again.

TL;DR: It feels weird between my sisters and I, they are making plans without me, seem uncomfortable when I want to join, and won't reply to my messages for weeks at a time. It might be a normal sign of them just needing some space, but something about it feels off, like they don't want me in their lives as much anymore.",1,1744709941.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

Marijuana Myth Buster: We need more research!

""We need more research!""

If I had a dollar for every time a politician uttered these words about cannabis, I'd probably have enough money to fund several lifetimes of research. It's become the go-to response whenever the topic of legalization comes up, a convenient way to kick the can down the road while appearing thoughtful and responsible.

But here's what keeps me up at night:¬†[How much research is enough](https://cannabis.net/blog/opinion/we-need-more-research-the-last-cannabis-excuse-exposed)? We currently have over 28,000 studies on cannabis, spanning decades of scientific inquiry. That's not counting the thousands of years of documented human use, dating back to some of humanity's earliest agricultural endeavors. Cannabis wasn't just any crop ‚Äì it was one of the first plants our ancestors chose to cultivate. Think about that for a moment.

Yet somehow, in 2024, we're still being told we need ""more research"" before we can definitively say that cannabis is safer than alcohol ‚Äì a substance that claims tens of thousands of lives annually. It's as if we're stuck in an endless loop of ""studying"" while ignoring the mountain of evidence already at our disposal.

Today, I'm going to help you cut through this smokescreen of perpetual research requirements. We'll look at the numbers, examine the facts, and hopefully put this tired old excuse to rest once and for all. Because let's be honest ‚Äì if we haven't gathered enough data after thousands of years of human use and tens of thousands of scientific studies, then we never will.

Buckle up, folks. It's time to bust this myth wide open!

# The past 10 years!

Let's talk numbers, because the figures are absolutely staggering. According to NORML's recent analysis of [PubMed.gov](http://PubMed.gov) data, scientists have published over 35,000 scientific papers about cannabis just since 2014. That's not a typo, folks ‚Äì thirty-five thousand studies in the past decade alone.

To put this in perspective, we're seeing over 4,000 new cannabis studies published every year. That means by the time you finish reading this article, another researcher somewhere has probably published their findings about our favorite plant. The pace of cannabis research isn't just steady ‚Äì it's exploding.

As NORML's Deputy Director Paul Armentano perfectly puts it, ""It is time for politicians and others to stop assessing cannabis through the lens of 'what we don't know' and instead start engaging in evidence-based discussions about marijuana and marijuana reform policies that are indicative of all that we do know.""

Here's a mind-blowing statistic: over 70% of all peer-reviewed scientific papers about marijuana have been published in just the last ten years. We're talking about the most intensively studied plant in modern history, with [PubMed.gov](http://PubMed.gov) now hosting over 49,500 scientific papers on marijuana dating back to 1840.

And what have all these studies taught us? Well, we know with certainty that cannabis is significantly safer than alcohol and tobacco ‚Äì two perfectly legal substances that claim hundreds of thousands of lives annually. We know it's less dangerous than virtually every other substance listed in the Controlled Substances Act. We know it has legitimate medical applications ‚Äì that's not up for debate anymore. And we know its addiction potential is comparable to coffee, not heroin (despite what its Schedule I status might suggest).

So when I hear politicians trot out the tired old line about needing ""more research,"" I can't help but feel my blood pressure rise. It's not just a cop-out ‚Äì it's an insult to the thousands of researchers who have dedicated their careers to understanding this plant. We have more than¬†[enough scientific evidence to create sensible,](https://cannabis.net/blog/opinion/how-the-nida-blocks-marijuana-research-over-and-over)¬†evidence-based cannabis policies right now.

Let's be real: continuing to hide behind the ""we need more research"" smokescreen isn't about science ‚Äì it's about politics. Yes, there will always be more to learn about cannabis, just like there's always more to learn about any subject. But we know enough ‚Äì more than enough ‚Äì to move forward with full legalization and smart regulation.

The next time someone tells you we need more research before we can legalize cannabis, ask them how many studies would be enough. Then watch them squirm as they try to justify ignoring the mountain of evidence we already have.

# Thousands of years of use

While our modern scientists continue to churn out studies about cannabis, there's another critical piece of evidence that prohibitionists conveniently ignore ‚Äì humanity's thousands of years of direct experience with this remarkable plant. In fact, when you look at human history, cannabis prohibition stands out as the unnatural anomaly, a brief but destructive departure from our long-standing relationship with this plant.

Let's talk timeline. The earliest evidence of human cannabis use dates back to around 8,000 BCE in Asia, where it was one of the first plants cultivated for fiber, food, and medicine. That's 10,000 years of documented human use! The ancient Chinese pharmacopeia, the Pen Ts'ao Ching, dating back to 2700 BCE, specifically referenced cannabis as a medicine for treating a variety of ailments. Queen Victoria famously used cannabis tinctures for menstrual cramps, and even George Washington grew hemp at Mount Vernon.

Here's where it gets really interesting ‚Äì our bodies actually evolved alongside this plant. The discovery of the endocannabinoid system reveals that we have an entire network of receptors that interact with cannabis compounds. Whether you believe in intelligent design or evolution, you have to acknowledge the remarkable symmetry here. We literally have a biological system that responds to cannabis ‚Äì that's not coincidence, folks.

Every major civilization throughout history has documented beneficial uses of cannabis. It appeared in the United States Pharmacopeia from 1850 until 1942, recognized for its therapeutic properties in treating numerous conditions. Ancient Egyptians used it for glaucoma, Indians for digestive issues, and Chinese doctors prescribed it for over 100 ailments. This isn't ancient superstition ‚Äì many of these applications are being validated by modern research.

So what happened? In 1937, against the advice of the American Medical Association, cannabis was effectively banned in the United States. This kicked off our grand experiment with prohibition ‚Äì an 87-year detour that has brought nothing but suffering, incarceration, and death. The only beneficiaries have been pharmaceutical companies, private prisons, and law enforcement agencies who've built empires around cannabis criminalization.

Let's put this in perspective: we have 10,000 years of documented beneficial use versus 87 years of prohibition-induced chaos. When someone claims ""we don't know enough"" about cannabis, they're not just ignoring modern science ‚Äì they're dismissing millennia of human experience.

Next time someone tries to tell you we need more research, remind them that cannabis has been extensively studied not just in laboratories, but in the real world, across countless cultures, over thousands of years. The evidence isn't just in peer-reviewed journals ‚Äì it's written in the history of human civilization itself.

We don't have a knowledge gap about cannabis ‚Äì we have a honesty gap among politicians who refuse to acknowledge what we already know.

# The Sticky Bottom Line

After diving deep into the mountain of evidence surrounding cannabis ‚Äì from over 35,000 recent scientific studies to millennia of documented human use ‚Äì one thing becomes crystal clear: claiming ""we need more research"" is nothing but a smokescreen for maintaining prohibition.

I'm writing this article to arm you with knowledge, to inoculate you against the virus of prohibition that has infected our political discourse for far too long. The next time someone regurgitates the ""we need more research"" talking point, you can confidently counter with facts: we have tens of thousands of modern studies, thousands of years of documented use, and an actual biological system in our bodies designed to interact with this plant.

Those still clinging to prohibitionist views aren't just uninformed ‚Äì they're actively choosing to ignore a vast body of evidence. It's like standing in a library and claiming books don't exist. The only explanation for such willful ignorance is the powerful influence of special interests who profit from keeping cannabis illegal. Big Pharma, private prisons, and certain law enforcement agencies have built empires on the foundation of prohibition, and they're not about to let facts get in the way of their profits.

Here's the ultimate irony: while our government was floating the idea of a ""Ministry of Truth"" to combat misinformation, they've been one of the primary sources of cannabis disinformation for nearly a century. From Reefer Madness to modern-day fear-mongering about the ""dangers"" of marijuana, they've consistently ignored science, dismissed history, and perpetuated lies to maintain their prohibitionist stance.

It's time to call out this hypocrisy. It's time to shut down bad-faith arguments about ""needing more research"" with the overwhelming evidence we already have. The truth is, we don't need more research to know that prohibition has failed ‚Äì we need more courage from our politicians to stand up to special interests and implement evidence-based policies.

So the next time someone tells you we need more research on cannabis, ask them: ""How many studies would be enough? How many years of human use would satisfy you? How much evidence do you need to acknowledge what we already know?"" Then watch as they struggle to defend the indefensible.

The sticky bottom line is this: we have the evidence. We have the science. We have the history. What we need now is the political will to act on it. And that, my friends, starts with refusing to let tired old myths about ""needing more research"" go unchallenged.

Knowledge is power, and it's time we used that power to end prohibition once and for all.

---------------------------------------------------------------

<div>In today‚Äôs fast-paced work environment, maintaining sharp focus and clear mental pathways is essential for productivity. Many professionals turn to functional beverages to give their cognitive performance a natural boost during the workday. These drinks, specially formulated to support brain health, combine ingredients that help enhance mental clarity, sharpen concentration, and sustain energy levels without the jitters or crashes often linked to traditional caffeinated beverages.

### Understanding the Role of Functional Beverages in Mental Performance

Functional beverages are designed to deliver targeted benefits beyond basic hydration. When you sip one, you‚Äôre not only quenching your thirst but also feeding your brain with nutrients that can uplift your focus. Key components typically found in these beverages include adaptogens, nootropics, vitamins, and minerals that have been shown to offer cognitive support.

For instance, ingredients such as ginseng and rhodiola are adaptogens that help your body manage stress, which is known to impair focus. By reducing stress levels, these adaptogens make it easier for you to concentrate on complex tasks or long meetings. Additionally, nootropics like L-theanine, often combined with caffeine, provide a calm yet alert mental state, enabling sustained attention without the typical caffeine crash.

### How Functional Beverages Improve Focus

The impact of functional beverages on your mental clarity often comes from how their ingredients work synergistically to support brain function. Here‚Äôs how they can influence different aspects of your concentration at work:

- **Enhanced Alertness:** Ingredients such as caffeine, when balanced by calming components like L-theanine, promote alertness without overstimulation. This combination keeps your mind clear and helps you avoid afternoon slumps.
- **Reduced Mental Fatigue:** Vitamins, particularly B-complex vitamins, assist in energy metabolism and neurotransmitter production, helping to fight off mental tiredness caused by prolonged cognitive effort.
- **Stress Moderation:** Adaptogens regulate the body‚Äôs response to physical and mental stress, which can otherwise cloud your thinking and make focusing more difficult.
- **Improved Mood:** Some functional beverages contain compounds that boost serotonin or dopamine production, neurotransmitters associated with improved mood and motivation, indirectly enhancing your ability to focus.
 
### Choosing the Right Functional Beverage for Work

With a variety of options available, selecting the right functional beverage can be a game changer for your daily productivity. Consider the following tips when picking one:

- **Look for Natural Ingredients:** Prioritize beverages with natural, scientifically backed ingredients. Avoid products with high sugar content or artificial additives that may cause energy crashes or other side effects.
- **Check Caffeine Levels:** Some functional drinks contain caffeine while others do not. If you're sensitive to caffeine, choose options featuring adaptogens or nootropics without stimulants.
- **Consider Your Personal Needs:** Whether you want to reduce stress or boost energy, different beverages target different concerns. Read labels carefully and select a drink that aligns with your mental performance goals.
 
### Integrating Functional Beverages Into Your Workday Routine

These drinks into your work routine can be simple and effective. To maximize benefits, follow these practical steps:

- Start your workday with a functional beverage replacing your usual coffee or energy drink to kickstart alertness smoothly.
- Use these beverages strategically during mid-day when focus tends to decline, offering a gentle pick-me-up.
- Stay hydrated by alternating functional drinks with water to maintain optimal brain function without dehydration.
- Pay attention to how your body responds and adjust intake timing or product choice accordingly.
 
### The Science Behind Better Focus with Functional Drinks

Research supports many of the ingredients found in functional beverages as beneficial for cognitive enhancement. For example, a combination of caffeine and L-theanine has been widely studied and shown to improve attention and mental task performance. Adaptogens are also being explored for their ability to reduce cortisol levels, which when elevated, negatively impact memory and focus.

Moreover, adequate intake of antioxidants and essential nutrients in these beverages can protect brain cells from oxidative stress and support neurotransmitter production, ensuring that your mental clarity remains sharp throughout demanding work periods.

### Practical Benefits You Can Expect

By integrating functional beverages into your daily habit, you‚Äôre likely to notice several advantages, including:

- Sharper concentration during meetings and detailed work tasks
- Faster response times and improved problem-solving abilities
- Reduced feelings of fatigue and mental sluggishness
- Stress resilience that helps maintain calm under pressure
- Heightened motivation and overall enhanced work performance
 
Ultimately, functional beverages offer a convenient and pleasant way to support your cognitive needs throughout the workday. By choosing the right blend of natural ingredients tailored to your individual focus and mental clarity goals, you can energize your brain and navigate your tasks with renewed mental agility.

</div>Key Ingredients in Functional Beverages That Enhance Cognitive Performance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Unlocking Mental Clarity Through Functional Ingredients

When it comes to boosting cognitive performance, functional beverages offer a compelling mix of natural compounds designed to sharpen focus, improve memory, and sustain brain health. Understanding the key ingredients in these drinks can empower you to make smarter choices for your mental stamina at work and beyond. Here‚Äôs a deep dive into the most effective components that functional beverages often include to support brain function.

### Caffeine: The Classic Focus Booster

Caffeine remains one of the most widely cherished ingredients in functional beverages aimed at enhancing alertness. It stimulates the central nervous system, helping reduce fatigue and increase concentration. Unlike coffee alone, many functional drinks combine caffeine with other brain-friendly compounds for a balanced and sustained energy boost.

- **How it works:** Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors in the brain, which helps keep you awake and attentive.
- **Usage tips:** Opt for beverages with moderate caffeine levels to avoid jitters or crashes.

### L-Theanine: Promoting Calm-Focused Energy

L-Theanine, an amino acid commonly found in tea leaves, pairs beautifully with caffeine to improve cognitive function without the side effects of overstimulation. Its ability to promote relaxation while maintaining focus makes it a favorite ingredient in functional drinks targeting work productivity.

- **Benefits:** Enhances attention, reduces stress, and increases alpha brain waves associated with relaxation.
- **Typical dosage:** Around 100mg combined with caffeine yields the best results.

### Ginkgo Biloba: Natural Memory Enhancer

Used for centuries in traditional medicine, Ginkgo Biloba is prized for its potential to improve memory and mental clarity by increasing blood flow to the brain. Functional beverages infused with Ginkgo aim to support cognitive longevity and sharper thinking during demanding tasks.

‚Äã -Get 20% Off Adaptogen Mushroom Superblends Here:https://hownow101.github.io/Adaptogens - ‚Äã  
  
- **Effects:** Enhances oxygen and nutrient delivery to brain cells, improving cognitive speed and memory recall.
- **Considerations:** May take a few weeks of regular consumption to notice significant benefits.

### Rhodiola Rosea: Adaptogen for Mental Endurance

This herbal adaptogen helps combat fatigue and stress, which are common roadblocks to maintaining focus at work. Rhodiola Rosea supports mental endurance by balancing neurotransmitter levels and improving mood, making it a powerful ingredient in functional beverages.

- **Why it matters:** Enhances energy metabolism in brain cells, contributing to sustained cognitive function under pressure.
- **Usage advice:** Often consumed in smaller doses, around 200-400mg per serving in beverages.

### B Vitamins: Fueling Brain Energy

B vitamins, especially B6, B9 (folate), and B12, are critical in energy production and maintaining healthy brain function. They help in the synthesis of neurotransmitters that regulate mood and cognition. Functional beverages enriched with these vitamins provide the necessary support for ongoing mental alertness.

- **Function:** Aid in reducing homocysteine levels which can impair cognitive processes.
- **Key sources:** Fortified drinks often contain B-complex blends to cover diverse brain health needs.

### Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Building Blocks of Brain Health

While less common in beverages due to their oil-based nature, some functional drinks incorporate omega-3s like DHA, essential for maintaining neuron structure and function. These fatty acids help improve memory, focus, and overall cognitive resilience over time.

- **Cognitive impact:** Supports communication between brain cells and reduces inflammation.
- **Formulation tips:** Encapsulation techniques help integrate omega-3s into liquid forms without compromising taste.

### Choline: Enhancing Memory and Learning

Choline is a vital nutrient that acts as a precursor to acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter linked to memory and learning. Functional beverages fortified with choline or its derivatives, such as alpha-GPC, aim to enhance brain signaling and cognitive sharpness, especially in challenging work environments.

‚Äã -Get 20% Off Adaptogen Mushroom Superblends Here:https://hownow101.github.io/Adaptogens - ‚Äã  
  
- **Benefits:** Supports faster information processing and improved mental clarity.
- **Integration:** Often paired with other nootropic ingredients for synergistic effects.

### Natural Antioxidants: Protecting Brain Cells

Ingredients rich in antioxidants, like blueberries, green tea extract, and turmeric, combat oxidative stress‚Äîa contributor to cognitive decline. Functional beverages containing these natural compounds help maintain brain health and support sustained mental performance.

- **Role:** Protect neurons from free radical damage and inflammation.
- **Examples:** Polyphenols in green tea and curcumin in turmeric are popular choices.

### Why These Ingredients Matter For Your Workday Focus

Functional beverages with these brain-boosting ingredients into your daily routine can give you a competitive edge at work. They not only provide a mental lift but also contribute to overall cognitive health. By choosing beverages with thoughtfully combined ingredients like caffeine and L-Theanine or omega-3s and antioxidants, you empower your brain to perform at its best‚Äîeven during long hours or stressful projects.

When selecting a functional beverage, look for transparency in ingredient sourcing, proper dosages, and minimal added sugars or artificial additives. This focus ensures that your drink supports clear thinking and lasting concentration, helping you navigate your workday with confidence and ease.

### Conclusion

Functional beverages have become a valuable ally for anyone aiming to improve mental clarity and maintain sharp focus during work hours. By tapping into the power of specially crafted drinks, you can experience a noticeable boost in your ability to concentrate and stay productive. These beverages are not just ordinary drinks; they are enriched with key ingredients such as natural caffeine, adaptogens, amino acids, and antioxidants that work together to enhance your cognitive performance.

Natural caffeine provides a gentle energy lift without the jitters, while adaptogens help your body manage stress, allowing your mind to stay calm and focused. Amino acids like L-theanine promote relaxation and improve attention, making it easier for you to tackle complex tasks efficiently. Antioxidants protect your brain cells from damage, supporting long-term mental health and clarity.

</div>Practical Tips for Applying Insights from Intimacy Books to Strengthen Your Marriage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Transforming Knowledge from Books into Everyday Actions

Reading books to improve intimacy in marriage can open your eyes to new perspectives and understanding. However, the real value lies in actively applying these insights to your daily life. It‚Äôs one thing to understand the importance of vulnerability or communication, but making those concepts a regular part of your relationship creates lasting change. Start small and build habits that bring you and your spouse closer.

Speak openly about what you learn. Share passages or ideas that resonated with you and ask your partner for their thoughts. This promotes dialogue and helps both of you feel involved in the process. Remember, intimacy grows through connection, and connecting over meaningful topics is a powerful step.

### Identifying and Prioritizing Your Unique Needs

Each marriage is unique. Books about intimacy often provide general advice, which can be tailored to fit your relationship. Take time to reflect on what aspects of intimacy‚Äîwhether emotional, physical, intellectual, or spiritual‚Äîyou want to improve. Communicate these priorities with your spouse gently and sincerely.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
You could:

- Make a list of intimacy areas you both feel need attention.
- Discuss which suggestions from the book feel realistic and exciting to try.
- Set achievable goals together, like scheduling weekly ‚Äúcheck-in‚Äù talks or planning intentional date nights.

This shared commitment transforms abstract ideas into personal, actionable plans.

### Implementing Communication Techniques Effectively

Books focused on improving intimacy often highlight communication as a cornerstone of a healthy marriage. Instead of just reading about active listening or expressing appreciation, practice these skills daily. When your partner talks, really listen‚Äîput away distractions like phones or TV. Reflect back what you hear to confirm understanding, which reassures both partners.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
Try expressing gratitude regularly. Openly acknowledging your spouse‚Äôs efforts makes your partner feel valued and deepens emotional connection. Simple phrases like ‚ÄúI appreciate how you‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt makes me happy when you‚Ä¶‚Äù foster warmth and security.

If you encounter conflicts, apply conflict resolution techniques recommended in your reading. This might involve taking a pause before responding, using ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements to avoid blame, or seeking compromise with empathy. Mastering this helps prevent disputes from eroding intimacy and instead builds trust.

### Practicing Physical Intimacy with Intention and Care

Many books emphasize that physical closeness is not just about sex but encompasses small, tender gestures that cultivate intimacy. Holding hands, hugging, or simply sitting close during conversations can all nurture connection. Pay attention to the non-verbal cues your spouse gives and respond with warmth.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
If your reading suggests exploring new ways to express physical affection, approach this with patience and respect for each other‚Äôs comfort zones. Physical intimacy grows from emotional safety, so focus on building that foundation first. Consider setting aside regular time without distractions to be together and enjoy physical closeness.

### Making Time for Intimate Moments in a Busy Life

One common challenge couples face is balancing busy schedules while nurturing intimacy. The tips found in marriage intimacy books often remind you that intentionality is key. Carve out specific chunks of time ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs a weekly date night, morning coffee together, or bedtime talks ‚Äì to focus fully on each other.

Planning ahead and protecting this time from interruptions sends a powerful message to your spouse that your relationship is a top priority. Consistent rituals like these become anchors in your marriage, strengthening intimacy through shared experiences.

### Using Journals and Reflection Tools to Track Progress

Some intimacy books include exercises or reflection prompts. Use these tools to monitor your growth as a couple. Keeping a joint journal or individual notes about your feelings, challenges, and triumphs can make intangible progress more visible.

Ask each other questions inspired by your reading, such as:

- What was a meaningful moment we shared this week?
- Where can I show you more support or love?
- What do you wish we did more often together?

Regularly reviewing your entries helps keep intimacy goals alive and encourages honest conversations.

### Seeking External Support When Needed

While books provide excellent guidance, some situations require additional help. If applying techniques from intimacy books feels overwhelming or doesn‚Äôt bring the results you expect, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out for couples counseling or therapy. A trained professional can offer personalized strategies and help navigate deeper issues.

Remember, using resources like books alongside professional help is a sign of strength and dedication to your marriage, not failure. Your commitment to improving intimacy is what truly matters.

### Final Thoughts on Building Lasting Intimacy

Books to improve intimacy in marriage are valuable tools that offer knowledge, encouragement, and practical ideas. The difference between reading a book and transforming your marriage lies in the intentional application of the insights you gain. By communicating openly, making time for each other, practicing affectionate behavior, and reflecting regularly, you can turn knowledge into meaningful connection.

I was a high school graduate destined for college football's glory. I‚Äôm big. Always was. Even before I touched a weight, I was the tallest kid in my class and had broad shoulders. The way my coach described it, I had the perfect foundation to build my future. I started working out daily and taking supplements to keep gaining muscle mass. By my junior year of high school, I was a beast on the field. I was getting scholarship offers left and right. By my senior year, I had picked out one of the scholarships to play pro football. I was going to be a starter and make millions. Or at least I would have. Going to a girl's house one night, I was tired and looking down at my phone to see the text message that was just sent from said girl.l I looked up bright lights and then, black. I awoke a few days later in the hospital. The driver that hit me was drunk and on my side of the road, and the cops told me that if I‚Äôd have swerved off the road, I would‚Äôve smacked a tree, and the damage to my body would have been even worse if I‚Äôd have survived at all.¬† He swerved back in his lane to avoid me, but he still hit me. Luckily, I was still alive. Him not so much. I was told later that he went through the windshield and had a healthy serving of tarmac for dinner that night. I feel bad for being glad about his death, but he took my career from me. The crash broke both my legs. That sent my future career that was so close to my grasp swirling down the toilet bowl. So I graduated in a wheelchair. After my legs had healed, I picked up some dead-end jobs that I usually quit or got fired from. My life was in a word shitty. But that changed one day at work. I was loading some bags of concrete on a truck with my coworker Dave when a woman interrupted me. She was about 5‚Äô7 and petite. She had blonde hair pulled into a messy bun and was very pretty. She had on blue jeans and a white V-cut top. ‚ÄúHey, mister!‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúCan you help me find something?‚Äù ‚ÄúSure, one moment, ma'am.‚Äù ‚ÄúHey Dave, can you finish up here?This customer needs help,‚Äù Dave muttered something under his breath about me, a pretty girl, and him having to do all the work. I escorted her inside and asked her what she needed help with. ‚ÄúI have a list right here. I need curtains, a rug, uh oh,¬† and bedsheets, and I need them all to match.‚Äù ‚ÄúOk, right this way, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to keep calling me ma‚Äôam, my name is Sara.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, ok, Sara, right this way,‚Äù I took her aisle to aisle, helping her pick out what she needed. When we were finished, I followed her up to the counter. Thanks, Jeff!‚Äù ‚ÄúHow do you know my name?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre name is silly!‚Äù ‚ÄúOh yeah, forgot about that,‚Äù I turned to the cashier, ‚Äúhey, use my discount for her.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, you don‚Äôt have to do that.‚Äù Sara said. ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs fine, please.‚Äù She pulled a wallet out of her peers, paid for the item, and handed me a card. ‚ÄúHere, take my business card.‚Äù On the top of her card in big bold letters were the words ‚ÄúGrace‚Äôs Place‚Äù and an address and a phone number. ‚ÄúFlip it over,‚Äù she said. On the back, below about 5 more names and numbers on the back were Sara‚Äôs. ‚ÄúCall me sometime, we‚Äôre looking for someone with your stature, and the position pays better than here, I guarantee,‚Äù she winked at me with the last word of her sentence. I called to set up an interview and arrived on the said interview date. Upon entering through the glass door, I was greeted by an older woman at the front desk. She was of average height and had greying hair. Her face was done in makeup that I could tell was used to try and hold on to her younger beauty. Something in her eyes told me that. ‚ÄúHi, sweetie, who are you here to see today?‚Äù Uh, I'm here for an interview.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, I see, you‚Äôre not a customer, follow me then.‚Äù She led me down a long hallway with doors to the left and right every 15 feet or so. Arriving at the end of the hall was a dark wooden door with a golden door knob and padlock. Following through the door, I was greeted by a standard office. Carpet floors, metal desks, and leather office chairs with wheels, and to the right, a couch and armchair sitting around a coffee table. To the back of the room was another door, but this one looked like an industrial metal door. ‚ÄúHave a seat.‚Äù She said, sitting down, she began the conversation. ‚ÄúSo, who recommended this position to you?‚Äù ‚ÄúSara, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, Sara! She‚Äôs a favorite around here, you know. So on to the job. The position is a security officer. Simple. The main part of the job is taking care of people looking to start trouble and keeping our profits safe. The pay is $1,000 a week. That‚Äôs all I can tell you until you accept the job. If you do, I can fill you in on the rest. Do you have any questions about what I just said?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo ma‚Äôam.‚Äù ‚ÄúGood I‚Äôve got some paperwork for you to fill out and then you will be ready to start!‚Äù After filling out the stack of papers and returning them to her, her demeanor changed. She went from bubbly and excited to serious and monotone. As if she lost all expression she then said ‚Äú are you ready for the truth?‚Äù I nodded, and she continued. ‚ÄúGrace‚Äôs is a brothel. I‚Äôm Grace. I started this business years ago and have run it without hiccups since. Our last security guard retired, making the position open for you to fill. You don‚Äôt have to worry about the cops working here. Multiple of them are customers and we scratch their backs and they scratch ours. The security office is through that metal door. The girls have a wired button on the side of their nightstand to call you if they need. You only turn the room camera on if you get the button push from them on the switchboard in front of the screen. If you're caught watching the girls working or changing, you will be fired. You're here to work, not get your rocks off. You want sex, you pay for it on your off time. You got all that?‚Äù ‚ÄúUh, yes ma‚Äôam.‚Äù ‚ÄúGood, cause you're starting right now. We had an incident yesterday, and we can‚Äôt wait any longer for someone to fill the security role.‚Äù I worked there for a while. I couldn‚Äôt tell you if it was months or years, but the one thing I can tell you in vivid detail about is the day Layla came to Grace‚Äôs. When I first met her, she and Grace were conversing with each other. I couldn‚Äôt make out every word, but from what I overheard, Layla wanted employment. Layla was a thing of pure beauty. She was a little less than 6 '0 and she had auburn hair, ivory skin, and light bluish green eyes. To say she was pretty was an understatement. But she was too pretty. Unnaturally pretty. Uncanny even. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôll get a 60/40 split leaning your way. You must be here on time and call if you're sick. The last thing I need is clients getting sick. When you do your taxes, you take them to this address on this card and this address only. He‚Äôs paid very well to make us look above board. You‚Äôll have around-the-clock security and speak of where he is now.‚Äù Grace explained to Layla. ‚ÄúHey Miss Grace, how are things?‚Äù ‚ÄúGreat as usual, Jeff. Come meet our newest employee, Layla.‚Äù ‚ÄúHey sugar, nice to meet the handsome man protecting me.‚Äù Layla said in a thick southern drawl. ‚ÄúHi, I'm Layla, welcome to Graces.‚Äù Grace then shooed me away as she continued showing Layla around. The rest of the day was uneventful. I sat in the office all day with no problems from the customers. Walked the ladies to their cars as usual and went home. Once home, I opened a cold beer and sat on the couch scrolling Facebook on my phone. That‚Äôs when I noticed a notification. A friend request from one Layla Smith.¬†

I came back on Saturday. I got ready for the day as it was our busiest day of the week. Go figure. Anyway, I came into the usual scene and went to the back office, putting my lunch in the fridge and sitting down, I pulled my Nintendo Switch out of my backpack and got ready for a hopefully quiet day. I learned quickly that I needed to bring something to keep me from dying of boredom. It was late into the shift, and I was eating my lunch when the switchboard lit up with the light and accompanying beeping. Looking up from my game, I saw it was room seven. Layla‚Äôs room. She took up residence in one of the two closest rooms to my office. The camera in the room was pointed directly towards the nightstand, and when I turned my monitor screen on, I saw that it wasn‚Äôt Layla who pushed it but the man who was in the room with her.¬†

His back was against the nightstand, and his face had a look of indescribable horror on it. The lamp that was at one time on the nightstand now rests on the floor beside it. Knocked over in what looked like a panic. I could see the man mouthing no over and over through the screen, and as he got louder, I could hear him ever so softly through the walls. Then slowly, the figure of Layla crept into frame. I don‚Äôt know what that thing was, but it wasn‚Äôt Layla. It looked like Layla, but it didn‚Äôt move like her. It twitches to and fro, almost as if waltzing slowly. And her skin. God, her skin. It was like someone stuffed a human skin suit with angry rats. Poking and prodding under her skin. Like dull needles pushing yet not going through. Stretching like her bones were alive. Then she stopped moving, and very slowly, her head moved. Not up or down or side to side, but slowly, ever so, her head twisted around until she was facing the camera. Her face looked like it was melting, and hanging unsettlingly low was a wide and low frown. Her eyes were gone, and her sockets were unnaturally large and black. In her mouth were long, thin teeth like yellow needles hanging as curtains inside of her disgusting maw. The door behind me suddenly swung open, and I spun insanely fast to see Grace looking at me and then past me to the screen.

¬†‚ÄúJeff, I told you not to be pervin' on the girls!‚Äù I turned to see Layla and the customer having sex on the screen. Normal sex. Nothing like what I had just seen. I shut the screen off and began explaining myself to Grace, withholding what I had seen. ‚ÄúSorry, ma‚Äôam, the button on the nightstand was pushed, and I just turned it on as you came in.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre lying, Jeff, there will be consequences. I‚Äôll ask Layla after she‚Äôs done, and that button better have been pushed!‚Äù The day continued somewhat normally while I quietly had a mental breakdown in my office, contemplating what I had seen or what I thought I‚Äôd seen. Did I see it? Did one of the girls slip something in my soda, or did I just hallucinate what I thought I saw? As the day progressed to an end, Grace called me into her office. ‚ÄúHey Jeff, Layla told me that the button got mashed in an accident, so we‚Äôre good, just remember what I said, do not be watching the girls. I‚Äôll see you on Monday.‚Äù That was the last time I would speak to the real Grace ever again, only I didn‚Äôt know that at the time.

¬†On Sunday, I was sitting in my chair with a beer in my hand when I got a FaceTime from Sara. ‚ÄúHey Jeff, some of the girls are going to get drinks, you wanna come?‚Äù ‚ÄúUh, sure, send me the location and I'll be there.‚Äù Honestly, a night of drinking was just what I needed to get what I saw off my mind. A couple of hours passed, and I grabbed my coat and headed out the door. Arriving at the bar, I entered and made my way to the booth in the corner where, among my coworkers, was an almost perfect mane of fiery auburn hair. I pushed the terrible memories of days past out of my mind and sat down with the group. ‚ÄúHey y'all,‚Äù I said to them as I sat down. ‚ÄúHey sugar,‚Äù Layla said in her southern drawl, to which Sara rolled her eyes in response. ‚ÄúI've got the rest of the tables' drink orders, except you,‚Äù Layla continued. ‚ÄúUh,¬† I'll take a boilermaker,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúWow, got something you need to forget tonight, you usually just get a beer,‚Äù Sara said. As I stared directly into Layla‚Äôs face, watching her smile, I replied, ‚ÄúYeah, something like that.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlright, hun,‚Äù Layla said as she got up and headed towards the bar.¬†

After some time had passed, Layla returned with the drinks, and we continued with the festivities of the night. Around 30 minutes later, I was mid-conversation when my mouth began to go numb. The room started spinning, and then everything went black. I awoke to loud banging. After wiping sleep from my eyes, I realized I was in my room, tucked in my bed, and I realized someone was knocking on my door. I pulled the sheets aside, thinking that I had never seen the blanket on my bed before. It wasn't mine. I turned to see the clock read 4 am. Hours before my shift started.¬† I opened my bedside drawer, retrieving my .38 special, and made my way to the door. Looking through the peephole, I saw that it was Officer McCain. McCain was an older man in his late 50s or early 60s and was, by all accounts, an honest man. He said lust was a sin for which there was no cure or redemption. However, he and Grace had history, and they adopted a relationship where he didn't ask and she didn't tell. To him, Graces was a massage parlor, and that's all it was, but he knew the truth, and when his wife got cancer, Grace personally paid all of her medical bills. So he didn't push the matter further. I tucked the pistol in the back of my belt and opened the door. ‚ÄúJeff, you need to come right away, there's been an accident. I've already told Grace, and she sent me to tell you. Sara‚Äôs at the hospital in critical condition.‚Äù Between the cottonmouth I already had and the feeling of pain that washed over me manifesting in my gut as if I'd just been sucker punched, I almost vomited. Arriving at the hospital, Sara was unconscious. I was told that she was involved in a hit-and-run. She was struck by an unknown party while walking home. Along with her high blood alcohol content was a sedative in her system as well, and she was wearing my jacket. I was questioned by the police and told them the events that had transpired hours before at that bar. At least I told them what I could. They immediately requested a blood sample from me to test for a sedative in my system, where, unsurprisingly, they found it. Far less than was in her system, but still there nonetheless. They asked me if I saw anyone suspicious or if any altercations may have transpired that night, but I told them no. Sara died on the operating table later that night. They were looking for a suspect, but I was already sure who had done it.¬†

I got in my car and sped to Layla's house. I arrived at her house to see that her pickup was not in the driveway. Exiting my car, I snuck around the back of her house, and sure enough, there it was. Investigating further, I saw that the bull guard on the front was dented on the passenger side, and in the dent was blood. Filled with rage, I began frantically looking for an entrance to her house. Opening a window to sneak in, I slipped through and drew my gun. The house was pitch black and smelled worse than anything I had ever smelled. Like necrotic flesh crossed with raw sewage. I continued further into the hallway,¬† ‚ÄúIf you wanted sugar, you could've just knocked,‚Äù Layla said behind me. I spun around and pointed the pistol at her head. ‚ÄúI know what you did you fucking bitch!‚Äù I shouted. Layla began to cry dramatically and curl towards the floor, and as she reached the ground, sobbing, I asked one question. One word. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Her sobbing grew more frantic until it turned to maniacal laughter. Her laugh was wrong. Like someone had recorded multiple people laughing at the same time and with her mouth spewing that god awful racket she slowly rose and in her many voices said, ‚ÄúBecause that bitch deserved it.‚Äù. I shot her twice in the chest. The odor that was once looming was now in my face, seeping from that thing's wounds. Out of the bullet holes poured dust that resembled cremated remains and eventually a thick black liquid. The thing spoke again. ‚Äú I'll eat your organs in front of you after watching everything you love be killed and destroyed in front of you and I started with that whore.‚Äù ‚Äúwh-why-what what the fuck are you!‚Äù ‚ÄúOnce I was the widow of the man you killed but now I am more. I was once one but now we are many.‚Äù It spoke in a low distorted tone and echoed in many voices. ‚ÄúYou can not hide from me anywhere you go, I will be there.‚Äù I fired one last shot in the thing's forehead and leaped through the window, landing on my chest and knocking the wind out of myself. I got up and ran to my car. I tore out of the driveway, and looking in my rearview mirror, I saw it giving chase. I pulled into the parking lot of Graces and, with my reloaded pistol, a Zippo, and a bottle of lighter fluid, I unlocked the building and entered. I was immediately assaulted with the same pungent odor upon entry. Grace greeted me behind the counter, but it wasn't her. Once again, I shot whatever this thing was in the head as that seemed to at the very least stun it. I ran through the hall to the security office and, upon entering, I barricaded the door behind me. I immediately disabled the security alarm and grabbed a thick binder off my desk. I engaged the magnetic locks on the front door from my office, and then I tore the pages from the binder in chunks and scattered them. They fluttered like dead birds onto the desk and carpet. I doused them in lighter fluid and struck the Zippo. The room went up fast, too fast, and for a moment, I thought it would take me with it. Maybe that was the point. As the flames crawled up the walls, I had decided my fate, that was, until I saw a window. Carved high in the brick wall, just big enough for me to fit through, I used the chair to smash it out before returning it to the ground and climbing through. As the flames reached the hall, that thing that had infected Gracee and killed Sara began to howl in agony. It was music to my ears. As I ran to the front, I could see my trap had worked. Layle and Grace clawed at the door, but it was no use. I got in my car and left.¬†

Having no job and draining what little I had in my savings I have made it to the other side of the country where in a shitty town in this shitty motel I type this as a warning to others. Today, I received an email about Grace‚Äôs grand reopening. I don't know how much time I have left, but please stay far, far away from Grace‚Äôs.

I was a high school graduate destined for college football's glory. I‚Äôm big. Always was. Even before I touched a weight, I was the tallest kid in my class and had broad shoulders. The way my coach described it, I had the perfect foundation to build my future. I started working out daily and taking supplements to keep gaining muscle mass. By my junior year of high school, I was a beast on the field. I was getting scholarship offers left and right. By my senior year, I had picked out one of the scholarships to play pro football. I was going to be a starter and make millions. Or at least I would have. Going to a girl's house one night, I was tired and looking down at my phone to see the text message that was just sent from said girl.l I looked up bright lights and then, black. I awoke a few days later in the hospital. The driver that hit me was drunk and on my side of the road, and the cops told me that if I‚Äôd have swerved off the road, I would‚Äôve smacked a tree, and the damage to my body would have been even worse if I‚Äôd have survived at all.¬† He swerved back in his lane to avoid me, but he still hit me.

I‚Äôll ask Layla after she‚Äôs done, and that button better have been pushed!‚Äù The day continued somewhat normally while I quietly had a mental breakdown in my office, contemplating what I had seen or what I thought I‚Äôd seen. Did I see it? Did one of the girls slip something in my soda, or did I just hallucinate what I thought I saw? As the day progressed to an end, Grace called me into her office. ‚ÄúHey Jeff, Layla told me that the button got mashed in an accident, so we‚Äôre good, just remember what I said, do not be watching the girls. I‚Äôll see you on Monday.‚Äù That was the last time I would speak to the real Grace ever again, only I didn‚Äôt know that at the time.

¬†On Sunday, I was sitting in my chair with a beer in my hand when I got a FaceTime from Sara. ‚ÄúHey Jeff, some of the girls are going to get drinks, you wanna come?‚Äù ‚ÄúUh, sure, send me the location and I'll be there.‚Äù Honestly, a night of drinking was just what I needed to get what I saw off my mind. A couple of hours passed, and I grabbed my coat and headed out the door. Arriving at the bar, I entered and made my way to the booth in the corner where, among my coworkers, was an almost perfect mane of fiery auburn hair. I pushed the terrible memories of days past out of my mind and sat down with the group. ‚ÄúHey y'all,‚Äù I said to them as I sat down. ‚ÄúHey sugar,‚Äù Layla said in her southern drawl, to which Sara rolled her eyes in response. ‚ÄúI've got the rest of the tables' drink orders, except you,‚Äù Layla continued. ‚ÄúUh,¬† I'll take a boilermaker,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúWow, got something you need to forget tonight, you usually just get a beer,‚Äù Sara said. As I stared directly into Layla‚Äôs face, watching her smile, I replied, ‚ÄúYeah, something like that.‚Äù ‚ÄúAlright, hun,‚Äù Layla said as she got up and headed towards the bar.¬†

After some time had passed, Layla returned with the drinks, and we continued with the festivities of the night. Around 30 minutes later, I was mid-conversation when my mouth began to go numb. The room started spinning, and then everything went black. I awoke to loud banging. After wiping sleep from my eyes, I realized I was in my room, tucked in my bed, and I realized someone was knocking on my door. I pulled the sheets aside, thinking that I had never seen the blanket on my bed before. It wasn't mine. I turned to see the clock read 4 am. Hours before my shift started.¬† I opened my bedside drawer, retrieving my .38 special, and made my way to the door. Looking through the peephole, I saw that it was Officer McCain. McCain was an older man in his late 50s or early 60s and was, by all accounts, an honest man. He said lust was a sin for which there was no cure or redemption. However, he and Grace had history, and they adopted a relationship where he didn't ask and she didn't tell. To him, Graces was a massage parlor, and that's all it was, but he knew the truth, and when his wife got cancer, Grace personally paid all of her medical bills. So he didn't push the matter further. I tucked the pistol in the back of my belt and opened the door. ‚ÄúJeff, you need to come right away, there's been an accident. I've already told Grace, and she sent me to tell you. Sara‚Äôs at the hospital in critical condition.‚Äù Between the cottonmouth I already had and the feeling of pain that washed over me manifesting in my gut as if I'd just been sucker punched, I almost vomited. Arriving at the hospital, Sara was unconscious. I was told that she was involved in a hit-and-run. She was struck by an unknown party while walking home. Along with her high blood alcohol content was a sedative in her system as well, and she was wearing my jacket. I was questioned by the police and told them the events that had transpired hours before at that bar. At least I told them what I could. They immediately requested a blood sample from me to test for a sedative in my system, where, unsurprisingly, they found it. Far less than was in her system, but still there nonetheless. They asked me if I saw anyone suspicious or if any altercations may have transpired that night, but I told them no. Sara died on the operating table later that night. They were looking for a suspect, but I was already sure who had done it.¬†

I got in my car and sped to Layla's house. I arrived at her house to see that her pickup was not in the driveway. Exiting my car, I snuck around the back of her house, and sure enough, there it was. Investigating further, I saw that the bull guard on the front was dented on the passenger side, and in the dent was blood. Filled with rage, I began frantically looking for an entrance to her house. Opening a window to sneak in, I slipped through and drew my gun. The house was pitch black and smelled worse than anything I had ever smelled. Like necrotic flesh crossed with raw sewage. I continued further into the hallway,¬† ‚ÄúIf you wanted sugar, you could've just knocked,‚Äù Layla said behind me. I spun around and pointed the pistol at her head. ‚ÄúI know what you did you fucking bitch!‚Äù I shouted. Layla began to cry dramatically and curl towards the floor, and as she reached the ground, sobbing, I asked one question. One word. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Her sobbing grew more frantic until it turned to maniacal laughter. Her laugh was wrong. Like someone had recorded multiple people laughing at the same time and with her mouth spewing that god awful racket she slowly rose and in her many voices said, ‚ÄúBecause that bitch deserved it.‚Äù. I shot her twice in the chest. The odor that was once looming was now in my face, seeping from that thing's wounds. Out of the bullet holes poured dust that resembled cremated remains and eventually a thick black liquid. The thing spoke again. ‚Äú I'll eat your organs in front of you after watching everything you love be killed and destroyed in front of you and I started with that whore.‚Äù ‚Äúwh-why-what what the fuck are you!‚Äù ‚ÄúOnce I was the widow of the man you killed but now I am more. I was once one but now we are many.‚Äù It spoke in a low distorted tone and echoed in many voices. ‚ÄúYou can not hide from me anywhere you go, I will be there.‚Äù I fired one last shot in the thing's forehead and leaped through the window, landing on my chest and knocking the wind out of myself. I got up and ran to my car. I tore out of the driveway, and looking in my rearview mirror, I saw it giving chase. I pulled into the parking lot of Graces and, with my reloaded pistol, a Zippo, and a bottle of lighter fluid, I unlocked the building and entered. I was immediately assaulted with the same pungent odor upon entry. Grace greeted me behind the counter, but it wasn't her. Once again, I shot whatever this thing was in the head as that seemed to at the very least stun it. I ran through the hall to the security office and, upon entering, I barricaded the door behind me. I immediately disabled the security alarm and grabbed a thick binder off my desk. I engaged the magnetic locks on the front door from my office, and then I tore the pages from the binder in chunks and scattered them. They fluttered like dead birds onto the desk and carpet. I doused them in lighter fluid and struck the Zippo. The room went up fast, too fast, and for a moment, I thought it would take me with it. Maybe that was the point. As the flames crawled up the walls, I had decided my fate, that was, until I saw a window. Carved high in the brick wall, just big enough for me to fit through, I used the chair to smash it out before returning it to the ground and climbing through. As the flames reached the hall, that thing that had infected Gracee and killed Sara began to howl in agony. It was music to my ears. As I ran to the front, I could see my trap had worked. Layle and Grace clawed at the door, but it was no use. I got in my car and left.¬†

Having no job and draining what little I had in my savings I have made it to the other side of the country where in a shitty town in this shitty motel I type this as a warning to others. Today I received an email for Grace‚Äôs grand reopening. I don't know how much time I have left, but please stay far, far away from Grace‚Äôs.

Boil water in small pot with a bit of salt

Take one mid 1990s corning-ware cereal type bowl and add elbow macaroni until it‚Äôs enough that when it‚Äôs cooked it‚Äôll fill about 3/4 of the bowl. If you own a broken analogue mail scale the combined weight of the bowl and macaroni should read 1st class rate $3.37. Add pasta to water

Take one coffee cup with flowers on it and cut in one slimish pat of butter. Not too slim. Pour milk into cup until butter is just covered. Microwave for 2:40 on 30% power. Butter should be almost completely melted. If the milk splattered all over the place it‚Äôs because sometimes your microwave just ignores the power level setting. Best to redo this step rather than attempt to salvage the milk and butter. 

When pasta is done put a small plate on top of the pot and little offset so water can drain but the elbows stay in the pot. Drain into sink

Return pot to stove top and pour in butter milk mixture. Stir it up so Mac gets butter and milk on it

Begin adding slices of American cheese from the deli not the individually wrapped slices in the refrigerated section. Be sure to take a rational sized bite out of each slice of cheese (Wisconsiners take half of what you think a normal bite would be). Add slices until a bit short of desired consistency because it will get too sticky and adding cold milk will start this back and forth where you end up with Mac and cheese soup

Salt and pepper to taste. 

Serve in pot and promise yourself you‚Äôll actually make one of Max‚Äôs recipes tomorrow rather than binge watching a dozen episodes then realizing it‚Äôs too late to go grocery shopping üòä

As tech innovators, you'll find this inspiring. A Swedish startup, TradeShift, has developed a blockchain-based platform that connects small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to larger corporations, enabling greater transparency, traceability, and efficiency in the supply chain. By using blockchain, TradeShift eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing fairness in transactions.

For instance, a coffee producer in Ethiopia can now trace the origin and quality of their coffee beans in real-time, while a coffee roaster in the US can verify the authenticity and quality of the beans without relying on intermediaries. This not only ensures higher-quality products but also helps reduce food waste and improve working conditions for farmers.

What's more impressive is that TradeShift has achieved this breakthrough by collaborating with major corporations like Maersk and Walmart, demonstrating the potential for blockchain to disrupt traditional industries and create new opportunities for innovation. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the potential for blockchain to transform industries like supply chain management is vast, and I couldn't be more excited to see what's coming next!",1,1744708756.0,u_Helpful_ruben,0,1.0,False

We‚Äôre a family of 3 in a 3 bedroom house, hosting 8 people. So 11 people in our 1200-sqft house rn. 

My mom was insistent on letting them stay over since, whenever we go to visit them, they‚Äôd let us stay in their homes for free. Which is VERY generous, but they all have much larger homes and it would only ever be the three of us visiting, sharing one room. Also it‚Äôs not like my family couldn‚Äôt have gotten a hotel or such. They could have afforded it (not even assuming this, they have done it in the past. A few years ago they got a NICE hotel near  Times Square which I know isn‚Äôt cheap.) Cramming this many people into one space feels ridiculous

I gave up my room to make space for our guests & had to move all of my things out of my room to make space for everyone (my room is exactly wide enough to fit two mattresses lol) And in the area where I put my stuff, my family put their luggage there as well. 

There‚Äôs people constantly going in and out of the living room. For some reason everyone left their water in the living room on the coffee table instead of in the rooms? So they keep coming out to drink and just kind of stare at me awkwardly. My uncle keeps getting up to use the bathroom and slamming the door shut and it‚Äôs 

It‚Äôs like five am. I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep.  Unrelated to this, I haven‚Äôt been doing the best mentally & spend a lot of time alone. Now more than ever, I need privacy but can‚Äôt have it

I feel a little cast aside by my parents at the moment. One thing that kind of broke me is that my mom remembered to buy enough pillows for the people staying over but didn‚Äôt account for me whatsoever, so now I‚Äôm sleeping on the couch instead of my bed, without a pillow & a slightly wet/cold blanket. (My mom washed my blankets for me while I was out, didn‚Äôt check on them until it was time to go to bed, so when I came back and wanted to sleep right away she told me that I had to wait and put my shit back in the dryer & that she wouldn‚Äôt do it and was going to bed. Thanks mom.)

I also feel like an asshole for being upset because it‚Äôs their vacation, and I‚Äôm killing the vibe by acting sad. Even more so, I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôm going to upset/offend my mom because I‚Äôm acting rude. I want to be happy and spend time with them but I can‚Äôt, like earlier we all went out to dinner and I was completely nonverbal the entire time without explanation which I know sucks to be on the other side of. Ugh

I don‚Äôt really have anyone to talk to about this & just want a second opinion. Part of me thinks I‚Äôm valid but the other part of me is like ‚Äúwow, you seriously can‚Äôt tolerate having FAMILY over for just a few days? It‚Äôs your responsibility. Get some actual problems‚Äù and I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. I‚Äôll get upset and then immediately start to doubt myself and feel super guilty

He frowned. ‚ÄúYou sure everything‚Äôs alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep. Look. Garden's thriving.‚Äù

""It sure is. Fancy a coffee?""

He never gives up.

The cat came after dark. Mangy. Moaning. Coughing blood over the herbs. It hissed when I got too close.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I hissed back. ‚ÄúYou don't belong here! Go home!‚Äù

I waited for hours for it to leave. Or die. It did neither.

I *had* to help nature along.

‚ÄúYou know you can‚Äôt just kill every animal that annoys you, right?‚Äù he said the next day.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious, Jenny.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo am I.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not‚Ä¶doing anything, like, *weird*, are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúDefine, *weird,* Alan.""

He let out an exhausted huff. ""Forget it. I'll-...I'll see ya later.‚Äù

That night, I saw him. Flashlight sweeping my yard.

I stayed in the dark, behind the shed.

He stepped over the fence.

‚ÄúAlan!‚Äù

‚ÄúWoah! Jesus! Yes, it‚Äôs just me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you doing here, Alan?‚Äù

‚ÄúHeard something again. Thought I‚Äôd check it out.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI-...Okay, look-...I know something‚Äôs going on. I saw you last night.‚Äù

‚ÄúGardening?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I mean the cat. This-...this isn‚Äôt normal.‚Äù

‚ÄúNeither are you,‚Äù I snapped.

‚ÄúI'm sorry, Jenny, but I‚Äôm calling the cops.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe fuck you are, Alan!‚Äù

‚ÄúStop it...Get away from me!...Stop it! Stop it, Jenny!‚Äù

-------

They‚Äôll come by eventually. The police. I‚Äôll shrug. Say he was a quiet guy. Kept to himself.

In spring, I‚Äôll plant more dahlias where the dirt‚Äôs still soft.

He always said flowers were a waste of space. Just like his wife had said eight-months-ago.

But they‚Äôll grow here.

*Everything* grows here.

When you think about your day‚Äîyour morning coffee, the sandwich you had for lunch, or even the clothes you‚Äôre wearing‚Äîit‚Äôs easy to forget that all of it started with agriculture. Simply put, agriculture is the process of growing plants and raising animals for food, clothing, and other everyday needs. It‚Äôs one of the oldest human activities, and still one of the most important.

# More Than Just Farming

Most people think of big green fields and tractors when they hear the word ‚Äúagriculture.‚Äù While that‚Äôs definitely part of it, agriculture includes so much more. It covers everything from growing fruits, vegetables, and grains to raising livestock like cows, chickens, and sheep. It also includes things like fish farming, growing flowers, and producing raw materials like cotton and wool.

Without agriculture, we wouldn‚Äôt have fresh produce, dairy, meat, or many products we use every day. Even things like cooking oil, chocolate, bread, and juice all come from farms in one way or another.

# From Past to Present

Thousands of years ago, people relied on hunting and gathering for food. But as soon as humans discovered how to plant seeds and raise animals, everything changed. Settling down and farming allowed communities to grow, trade to develop, and civilizations to rise.

Today, agriculture looks very different. Thanks to technology, farming is faster, smarter, and more efficient. Farmers now use machines, GPS systems, and even drones to check on crops, manage water, and get better results. Science also plays a big role, helping farmers protect plants from pests and improve soil health.

# Why It Matters Today

Agriculture is still the foundation of life, even in our modern world. It feeds billions of people and supports millions of jobs around the globe‚Äînot just on farms, but in food transport, processing, and sales too.

More and more people are realizing how important it is to know where our food comes from. Local farming, organic produce, and farm-to-table movements are growing in popularity. When we support farmers, we support healthier food systems and stronger local communities.

# Challenges Farmers Face

Even with all the progress, farmers today face big challenges. Climate change, unpredictable weather, water shortages, and rising costs make farming harder than ever. In some areas, good farmland is disappearing, and fewer young people are choosing to go into agriculture.

Despite these challenges, farmers continue to adapt. Many are turning to sustainable and eco-friendly practices to protect the environment while still growing enough food. Things like crop rotation, natural fertilizers, and water-saving technologies are helping make farming more sustainable.",1,1744707259.0,u_Acrobatic_Refuse_725,0,1.0,False

I recently came across a local brand called **Craftery** while hunting for *living room furniture in Kerala*, and I thought I'd share in case anyone else is looking to revamp their space.

What really stood out to me was their blend of traditional craftsmanship and modern design. Whether you're into minimalistic teak wood sofas or cozy rustic coffee tables, they‚Äôve got some beautiful options. They even offer custom-made pieces which is perfect if you‚Äôre trying to match a certain aesthetic or size (hello, small apartments!).

Plus, they‚Äôre locally based, which means no crazy shipping delays or damage concerns. I visited their showroom (they're based in Kerala) and was super impressed with the quality and how helpful the team was in suggesting pieces that suited my space and vibe.

If you‚Äôre currently furnishing or upgrading your home and want something that's stylish but still has that homegrown, Kerala charm, Craftery is totally worth checking out.

Would love to know if anyone else here has bought from them? Or if you have any other local recommendations for living room furniture in Kerala, feel free to share!

Sonnys penthouse would provide the cover of making it look like a mob hit on Sonny. The person who benefited the most from the bombing was Drew. Recently Drew talked  Willow into signing a document regarding custody of the kids. We do not know what was in the document but, Wiley and Amelia come with ELQ and Aurora stocks. 

If Jason and Michael both died. Willow would inherit Aurora or it would go to Wiley and Amelia controlled by whoever had custody of Wiley and Amelia. Dannys stocks would be controlled by whoever had custody of Danny. That could give Drew control of ELQ with Martin as Dress attorney Drew could acquire Valentine ELQ stocks. 

Drew would have his ultimate revenge.

So I built this sweet CustomModal component in React Native. Everything was cool ‚Äî animation, buttons, even an image at the top to make it look less like a LinkedIn message box and more like a decent UX.

BUT ‚Äî then came the scroll bug.



The problem?

Whenever I added children inside the modal (think dynamic forms, nested madness, long descriptions), the content either:

Overflowed like my morning coffee on Monday,

Refused to scroll like my grandma‚Äôs old Facebook feed,

Or just vanished into the React Bermuda Triangle.


And when it did scroll, it looked like it was glitching through alternate dimensions on certain screen sizes.




The fix?

I sat down. Took a deep breath. Pondered the mysteries of ScrollView, maxHeight, and flex-grow.

Then came the 3-step exorcism ritual (aka the actual solution):




1. Replaced static height with max-h-[70vh]

Because we‚Äôre not in 2002 ‚Äî responsive design is the holy grail.

2. Wrapped it with ScrollView + keyboardShouldPersistTaps=""handled""

Now inputs inside the modal don‚Äôt throw tantrums when the keyboard opens.

3. Used flex-grow inside the View to make scrolling silky smooth

I wanted it to scroll‚Ä¶ but only when it had to. Like that one friend who shows up when free food is mentioned.




Bonus Improvements:

KeyboardAvoidingView makes sure the whole thing floats up when the keyboard appears (iOS, I see you).

Loading spinner is shown like a pro ‚Äî no jumping buttons or layout shifts.

Takeaways

Don‚Äôt fight the modal. Befriend it. Feed it flex-grow.

Don‚Äôt assume ScrollView respects your layout until you respect its props.

Always give it some breathing room with vh units ‚Äî trust me, it needs it.





Hope this helps someone stuck in scroll limbo!

1jzn2ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jzn2ww/aita_for_making_my_husband_believe_that_i_was/,AITA for making my husband believe that I was going to smash his head with a fake beer bottle instead of a real one?,"Four years ago, I, Female 28 got married to my wonderful (or so I thought) husband Male 31 John. He was the kind of man you'd see go viral for his green flags on tiktok, make the news for a good samaritan act, walk the old lady down the street - you get the gist. Our marriage life was nothing but literal bliss for the years we've been together. I birthed two amazing boys for this man and I'm going to be a mother to a baby girl this june. When I say I was with John from the beginning of his career, I MEAN IT. Back when his start-up was a 113 sq ft rented rooftop room under a coffee shop in the boondocks of new york, I was the one bringing him his lunch during the break time of MY 9-5, printing his business flyers with my company printer when we were strictly warned not to because he couldn't afford one, and I was the only person who financially supported him through all of this while earning minimum wage. Thankfully, two years went by and some start-up investor mogul cashed out enough money for John to establish his business and turn it into the multi-million company it is today. I could not have been happier for him, truly. 

Fast forward to yesterday morning, John had to rush early to the office because of a software malfunction and forgot to take his lunch with him. Our marriage life had been, quite dull for the past few months due to his busy schedule so I thought I'd drop by to give it to him, in his favourite outfit, wearing the perfume he said he loved on me, and to top it all off, a cake that said ""I will always be proud of you, babe"".

Well. I guess I missed the memo because once I'd entered his office, someone had already beat me to it. There I saw John groping and making out with the fucking secretary that I'd hired for him. I know this sounds cliche, but I dropped the cake. I've never felt numb before - you grow up in an environment where you're expected to take care of all the people in your life, and no adversity will stop you. But this was John. John was my everything. Luckily, no one was at the employee quarters to see me cry ugly tears as they just kept going at it like a 365 days scene. I quickly welled myself up, and left through the door right away. After I drove back home, John had sent me a message saying that he wouldn't be able to come home early that day due to the software malfunction still troubleshooting. It had been fixed when I got there. I replied back saying that I'm going to be going on an early holiday by myself for some ""me-time"" and that I'll be leaving the kids with my mom. He didn't think this was odd since we both take spontaneous sabbaticals to relax sometimes.

During the 7 days I took off to come to terms with the situation, I understood that our marriage was ruined. But after all that I've poured into it, I would not leave empty-handed. I've talked to lawyers about divorce and I'm in the process of filing certain documents before I break the news to him. While I was drowning myself in tequila on the 6th day of this sabbatical, I don't know what went over me but I swooped into this frenzy and started crying right at the tiki bar and had all the foreign tourists look at me like I'm mentally ill. I woke up to 4 bar employees over me concerned for my well-being. I have NEVER felt this vulnerable before. This was my end-point. The next day I'd sobered up and woken to a message from my Mother-in-law calling us for the annual reunion we have. All of my ex-husband's family lives abroad and it's beyond difficult trying to get us all together at one place so we hold these yearly reunions that are mandatory for all of us to attend. 

My husband and I used to have a tradition of always pulling some sort of prank when we visit. Be it something simple like coming to the reunion with a balloon inside my shirt to fake a pregnancy, then it popping by accident infront of all of them, or filling people's glasses with grape juice instead of wine and telling them it's a 1990 vintage bottle made by the doyennes of winery to see if they get drunk by the placebo effect. I was reminded of a trend that went viral before on social media of people buying these fake sugar beer bottles and pranking their family and friends by smashing it on their heads. I was quick to notify John about the ""plan"" and he was equally as excited. I showed him amazon screenshots of a 12 pack of these fake beer bottles and tiktoks to recreate of the prank, all while I finished 2 budweisers, cleaned the bottles, and switched them out for the pack of fake ones.

I know what you're thinking, say I do pull this off, his whole family might as well call the police on me, turn this whole thing over, and I'd be spending a good 2 years in Prison. However on my part, John has been dealing with Bipolar Disorder ever since he diagnosed at 14 years old. Even now he has manic episodes and starts trashing the place and rolling up into a ball whenever he does it. Mind you, every single time he has a scare, I'd be right next to him repeating safe words, reassuring him that all will be okay, and taking care of all his medication and business throughout the next few days so he can get back to his sane self. This meant that once I smash those bottles on his head infront of every single person in his living bloodline, I could go full damsel in distress and say, ""John... Don't tell me you- you switched two fake bottles for real ones?"" in this mutter of a voice. And so I did.

Come the day where we all gather. John and I are matching in beige, while the children wear red and yellow. His family members are vigilant and keep teasing us about what this year's prank is gonna be. I just keep telling everyone the same thing. ""This one is all John!"". He's always been one for the spotlight, so he didn't spare a second telling aunt to kid that this whole prank was orchastrated by him and that they'd be in for such a treat (The only satisfaction he's given me in years). 

After we all finish eating his mom's special lasagne dinner, John and I settle at the dining table with the others and start up a conversation that (as we planned) will end with us getting rough and throwing table cloths at eachother. I escalate this by kicking a stool to his foot, and he kicks it back even harder, so I stomp on over to my bag and reach for the ""sugar glass"" beer bottle.

""THOMP"" rang through the entire room. John's family's faces that were filled with smirks ran cold after realizing that this supposed predictable prank was nothing that they'd expected. John stood there with one eye open and a gush of blood running from his forehead, trying to piece atleast part of the situation. That's when I dropped my one-liner. ""John... You didn't""

""Please don't tell me you relapsed""

""How could you John? Why would you hurt yourself?""

Everyone knew by then what had truly went down, and as I dramatically dropped the bottle in my hands - it shattered into copious amounts of coarse glass. All of his female cousins had made a circle around me and comforted me, saying things like ""it'll be okay"" and ""don't cry"". John's dad had put his disheveled, hysteric, and crying son on his shoulder, and his mom phoned the Psych Ward he frequently visited as a teenager. The paramedics came by and rolled him into an ambulance for further care. I heard the EMT say something about a ‚Äúdisassociative episode,‚Äù and his mom muttered ‚Äúit must be the stress.‚Äù  


Sure. Stress.

Now he‚Äôs on a 72-hour psychiatric hold, and I‚Äôm back home, sorting papers with my lawyer.

  
The real prank?  
I don't know.

John, though?  
He gets to tell the nurses how I smashed a bottle over his head and it felt like love.

  
The plan did go perfectly well. Too perfect even. But that doesn't take away the fact that I acted like an immature fucking 15 year old getting back at her frat boyfriend for picking jenny mcgee over her for prom. I have children, and a life that I put on hold for a month just to get back at my cheating husband who deserved nothing but a court case and a deposit of 15 million for my Emotional Distress damages.

I can't look at my older son's face as he asks me when daddy's going to be back from his trip in the white room knowing that he would be safe and sound at home if it weren't for my actions. Sometimes I wish I could have handled the situation better and not acted out of anger and vengeance.

I know all will go to plan for me after John comes back home. I'll break the news and see his face crumble knowing he'll lose his wife, but get on his knees and plead for me not to tell anyone of his disloyalty.

Why? Because John would trade one of my sons if that meant his reputation would be as clean as Keanu Reeves. I'll get my kids, my compensation, and my sanity, but I'm filled with so many emotions and second guesses of how there might be other drawbacks coming to get me.

  
I'll update everyone on here once I rip the band-aid off. Till then, could I please get some advice on If I was taking this too far? I appreciate you for reading this.

Voltprofit Max is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users trade a variety of financial assets‚Äîcryptocurrencies, forex, stocks, and even commodities‚Äîwithout needing to manually analyze charts all day. It uses algorithms to scan the market, identify trading opportunities, and execute trades on your behalf.

## Who Created Voltprofit Max?

The creators of Voltprofit Max are a bit of a mystery‚Äî**no specific names are tied to the platform**, which is kind of standard for these kinds of trading bots.

## How Does Voltprofit Max Work?

Voltprofit Max works by using **AI-driven algorithms** and market indicators to detect potentially profitable trades. Once it spots a good setup, it can automatically execute the trade using your pre-set parameters (like risk level, asset preference, etc.). You can also switch to manual trading if you want more control.

Here‚Äôs a basic breakdown of the workflow:

- The bot scans the market using historical data and current pricing trends.
- It identifies trading signals and matches them with your preferences.
- It executes trades automatically (or alerts you if manual mode is enabled).
- You monitor the results and adjust your settings if needed.

Pretty straightforward, and the best part? **You don‚Äôt need to be glued to your screen all day**.

## Voltprofit Max Pros and Cons

- ‚úÖ Fast registration and easy setup process

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå No info about the founders‚Äîtransparency could be better

- ‚ùå Like any trading platform, **you can lose money**

I was making some coffee than the grocery delivery came.  Then my mother got up.  As soon as I had the delivery in she started giving me dogs abuse to me. 

She must have went into my room (as per usual) she loves going into my room and stealing.  She must be going into my room now even when I am at home.  So she went in and came into the kitchen to shout at me because I have a dehumidifier on in my room and all she did was argue with me. 

She is paranoid about high electricity bills. Even though our last bill was not high.  She doesn't know how to read a bill and see that much of the charge is like tax, vat, and other carbon missions charges on the bill.   But also, she doesn't know how to comprehend the bill and adapt around the home.  She is always using the tumble dryer herself. She is always putting on washing loads in the machine using a high temperature and adding extra rinses etc.  She is someone who will boil a full kettle of water and leave half of it unused.  She doesn't know how to understand energy usage herself around the home and it's easier for her to target me and give me dogs abuse.

1jzmqrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1jzmqrj/does_detox_tea_reduce_belly_fat/,Does detox tea reduce belly fat?,"Like a lot of people, I‚Äôve tried plenty of things to flatten my stomach‚Äîworkouts, low-carb meals, tracking every bite on an app. Some worked (sort of), some didn‚Äôt at all. But one thing I had *never* taken seriously was detox tea. It always sounded like a gimmick, or worse, something that would send me running to the bathroom.

Then I started hearing about **Lulutox Detox Tea**, mostly through TikTok and Reddit threads. People kept talking about how it helped with **bloating, digestion, energy**, and even **belly fat**‚Äîso I decided to test it out myself for 6 full weeks.

If you‚Äôre wondering, **does detox tea reduce belly fat**, I‚Äôve got a full breakdown for you‚Äîfrom the ingredients to how I felt day-to-day.

**Why Lulutox Tea stood out to me**

The first reason I gave it a shot? The ingredients actually looked legit. Unlike those harsh ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù teas that are basically just laxatives, **Lulutox tea** is made from **13 natural herbs and superfoods** that support digestion, energy, and metabolism‚Äîwithout wrecking your stomach.

Some of the key **lulutox tea ingredients**:

* **Matcha Green Tea** ‚Äì helps with calorie burn and energy
* **Yerba Mate & Guarana** ‚Äì natural energy boosters with antioxidants
* **Sencha & Oolong Tea** ‚Äì support digestion and reduce inflammation
* **Dandelion Leaf & Milk Thistle** ‚Äì often used for liver support and detox
* **Ginseng, Goji Berries, Lemongrass, Nettle Leaf** ‚Äì soothing and immune-supporting
* **Stevia Leaf** ‚Äì adds a touch of natural sweetness with zero calories

The tea is **vegan, soy-free, dairy-free**, and contains a small amount of caffeine (around 18mg per bag). I liked that it wasn‚Äôt overloaded with stimulants.

**What I did (and didn‚Äôt) change during the trial**

I didn‚Äôt overhaul my diet. I just added one cup of **lulutox detox tea** per day, either in the morning or early afternoon. I walked 20‚Äì30 minutes most days and ate reasonably well‚Äînothing super strict. No meal plans or calorie counting.

The tea itself tastes light and slightly peachy. No bitterness or weird aftertaste. I actually looked forward to drinking it, which helped me stay consistent.

**Here‚Äôs what happened week by week**

**Week 1‚Äì2:**  
The biggest change was bloating. Within a few days, my stomach felt flatter‚Äînot because I lost fat overnight, but because my digestion was smoother. I wasn‚Äôt unbuttoning my jeans by 5 PM like I usually do.

**Week 3‚Äì4:**  
This is when I noticed a shift in appetite. I wasn‚Äôt craving snacks as often, and I felt fuller for longer. I also felt more clear-headed and less dependent on coffee. One unexpected bonus was better sleep‚Äîmaybe because I wasn‚Äôt drinking caffeine late into the day.

**Week 5‚Äì6:**  
I stepped on the scale and was down 5 pounds. But more importantly, my **waistline looked visibly slimmer**. I wasn‚Äôt sucking in my stomach all day, and my posture even felt better. My digestion was regular, and I had more energy throughout the day without the afternoon slump.

So‚Ä¶ **does lulutox detox tea reduce belly fat?**  
Indirectly‚Äîyes, in my experience. It didn‚Äôt ‚Äúmelt fat‚Äù off me, but by reducing bloating, helping me control cravings, and supporting regular digestion, it absolutely helped **flatten my belly** over time.

**Were there any lulutox tea side effects?**

Not really. I was expecting cramps or sudden bathroom trips (like other detox teas), but **Lulutox was super gentle**. No discomfort, no urgency. The only thing I noticed was I felt a little dry if I didn‚Äôt drink enough water‚Äîso hydration is key.

If you‚Äôre asking **is lulutox tea safe**, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a good fit for most people, but of course, check with your doctor if you‚Äôre pregnant or on medication.

**Where to get Lulutox Detox Tea (watch out for fakes)**

If you're wondering **lulutox tea where to buy**, make sure to get it from the official site. There are knockoffs floating around that look similar but don‚Äôt have the same ingredients.

Here‚Äôs the [**link I used to order mine**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) ‚Äî it had a 70% discount when I got it, and I think the deal‚Äôs still going.

Later I saved this [**second link with the same offer**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?uid=34821&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) just in case the first one stopped working.

**Final thoughts on Lulutox Detox Tea**

If you‚Äôre looking for a natural, no-pressure way to support your digestion, reduce bloating, and maybe chip away at stubborn belly fat‚Äî**lulutox detox tea does it work**? It did for me.

It‚Äôs not magic, but it‚Äôs a helpful tool. Combined with small lifestyle tweaks, it made a real difference in how I felt and looked.

If you‚Äôve tried it, I‚Äôd love to hear your own **lulutox tea review**. What changes did you notice? Any unexpected **lulutox detox tea side effects**? Curious how it‚Äôs working for others.",1,1744705697.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False
1jzmq26,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1jzmq26/back_from_17_days_trip_tokyo_kyoto/,"Back from 17 days Trip Tokyo, Kyoto","There are obviously some things that will be redundant that people have shared, but hopefully I can share my experience that will help out a few!   Group of 4, rented a manual wheelchair for my mom at Haneda airport.  If you need a wheelchair I would totally recommend this.  Filled out a form online at:  [https://ut-haneda.jp/wheelchair\_stroller\_rental\_list/](https://ut-haneda.jp/wheelchair_stroller_rental_list/) .   Had to pay cash for it but was 17,000 yen for 17 days . The people who work there are super nice and helpful.    I had to go to Terminal 1 to pick up the wheelchair when we arrived.   There's a free shuttle bus that takes people to each terminal.  Hopped back on this to get back to Terminal 3 where my family was waiting.  When we arrived, I had everything filled out in advanced and used the QR code.    I was a little confused because after using the QR code with the airport agent,  You then had to go to a station/screen where you had to scan the QR code again . This 2nd time it gives you a number, then number lets you know which line to go in for the 2nd part of customs.  Didn't realize this at first so we had to ask a worker.   

We ended up using the Limo bus to get to our hotel.  My struggles continued as I tried to use the machine to purchase the ticket for the bus.  I couldn't find Asakusa for the life of me, so I had to purchase the tickets through the bus ticket counter.  This was simple.  In hindsight, I think I had to select another option to narrow down where Asakusa was so i didn't click enough options apparently.  I would totally recommend the Limo bus if you hotel is close to the stops it makes.  It's cheap, and relaxing after a long flight.

We got physical PASSMO cards and they worked out great.  They work so well and can use them for a lot of things to for purchases.  I downloaded the SmartEX app and it worked out really well for me with the card.  I didn't realize how easy it was to designated 4 different PASSMO cards to the each person's Shinkansen tickets.   This made using the trains a breeze.  I would recommend this to everyone.  Only 2 times we went through the wrong ticket gate in the stations, couldn't just tap back out, but the agents working the gates easily fixed this.  One time this happened in Shinjuku station (no surprise, that station is craaaaaazy). 

I would say if you can avoid Shinjuku station then do it! lol.   I firsthand got a good experience why it's one of the most complicated, if not the most complicated station in the world.   We got off our stop at the station and had to transfer to the Keio New Line.   Up until now it was pretty staightforward finding where you need to go to find what line you need to go to.  But nope, the New Keio Line was at the opposite end of where I was at, and their were no signs to direct me where to go.  Luckily this only lasted a few minutes and a local asked me where we were trying to get to.  He was the savior for this trip!!  He not only told me where we needed to go but he took me there!  I tried telling him I could figure it out but he kept insisting he would show us since the station was confusing.  FYI if you need to take this line and Google tells you to get on Platform 4, just go through the gate where Platforms 3 and 5 are.   There's a tiny written sign that says something about 4 is here too.  Defintely glad I experienced the complexity of this station.  

In Tokyo we stayed in Asakusa.  Very chill neighborhood right next to Kappabashi Street.  Was perfect for the 4 of us.  Very spacious place and had everything we needed including, plates/bowls, utensils, microwave, fridge/freezer.   The room was set up really nice because the shower, toilet, and sink were in seperate areas so we all could be doing something in the morning getting ready.  4 would be ideal, I think it can hold 4-6 people, but 6 adults would be too much.  If you had 2-3 kids then 6 is doable with all the suitcases.  

In Kyoto we stayed at the Hyatt Place.  This was easily the nicest Hyatt Places I've been to.  Subway was right underneath the hotel.  I would definitely stay here again.  I used points and this was one of the best value to use your points at!   The ONLY downside I would say about this place is their coffee situation . The machines seemed really nice, but they sucked.  I would recommend anyone to just settle for a instant coffee so you can make it up in your room.  you literally have to take your mugs from your rooms downstairs every morning just to get coffee from a machine that may or may not be working well.  

Pay attention to the floors in stores especially. I almost butted in line once because I wasn't aware of this early on in our trip.   The arrows will guide you where to go for lines at many stores.

Google maps worked REALLY well for me 90% of the time.  For some reason it wasn't being super accurate at times when my location.  And this was when I was above ground . The LIVE view would also steer me in the wrong directions at times as well.   Sometimes Maps  would put me in 3D view when 2D was so much better for me(could have been user error with this).  Definitely finicky at times but overall it saved my butt most times so I really am not complaining.   Probably just time for a new phone sooner than later.  It worked really well to direct us where to enter and exit stations depending on where the elevators were.

Wheelchair:  My brother was a great sport and pushed my mom the whole time since I was usually always navigating us.  This provided challenges at times, and definitely took more time, but it worked out really well for us.  It was a blessing in disguise since we often tried to avoid the super packed/touristy areas and just went to other places, or down a few streets exploring the not so busy places.  There were times where places were so busy or there weren't any elevators, we just had to use stairs or escalators for the wheelchair.   Luckily my mom can get up ok, but only has a few miles in her each day.  Ended up using the escalators a little more towards the end since most elevators are super small and a lot of people use them.  

Yokohama:  We all LOVED this place.  Only went down for a day, but could have easily spent a few days there.  The vibe is so much different, and it was so much more open for the wheelchair and not so packed with people.   The shopping malls down there are rediculous . Much more family friendly I feel.  Everywhere the food was great, but this place was so much better for larger groups.    Very nice place. 

Highly recommend Hiroshima.  1 day you have to be efficent though.  Start really early, if you go to Miajima, definitely get their earlier than later and book a round trip boat ticket.  Saw a few people trying to buy tickets when we were leaving and they were sold out.  

Nara:  We didn't like our trip here as much as I was hoping.   I'm sure this place has so much more to offer, but we didn't have time for it.  Wasn't a fan of how crowded it got, luckily this was more so as we were leaving.  Didn't want to feed the deer.  They were a little too aggressive for my taste,  Just avoided them.  Totally different than the deer at Miajima.   Todaiji¬† DID make it worth the visit though.  That temple is just jaw dropping.  Really glad I went there.  

Cash:  I tried to use my cash when my total was an even number. E.G.  1980 Yen or 150 yen.  Avoided when the totaly was something like 273 yen.   THis limited the amount of coins I accumulated.  Makes it easier to recharge the IC card with your coins as well.  The pesky 1 yen coins are just silly . 

Overall, Loved everything about this country:  The food, the people, their culture, how organized everything is.  I could have counted on 1 hand how many times I heard a car honk their horn.   Try to avoid the overhyped places. Like many other have said, some of the best experiences in Japan are those really random things, sometimes just going off the beaten path is the best thing you can do.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The top 20 ounce bottles distinguish themselves through a combination of innovative features, durable construction, and user-friendly design.

**Material:** The bottle's construction material significantly impacts its durability, insulation, and overall performance.

Most premium 20 ounce bottles are made from either stainless steel, Tritan plastic, or glass. Stainless steel offers excellent durability and insulation, keeping beverages hot or cold for extended periods. Tritan plastic is BPA-free and shatter-resistant, making it a lightweight and safe alternative. Glass bottles are known for their purity and resistance to leaching chemicals, but they are more fragile than steel or Tritan. High-quality bottles will clearly state the material used and its benefits.

**Insulation:** Insulation is crucial for maintaining beverage temperature.

Double-walled vacuum insulation is a common feature in stainless steel bottles. This technology creates a barrier between the inner and outer walls, minimizing heat transfer and keeping drinks cold for up to 24 hours or hot for up to 12 hours. Some bottles also feature copper linings to enhance insulation performance. It's important to note that the effectiveness of insulation can vary depending on the ambient temperature and the bottle's design.

**Lid Design:** The lid plays a vital role in preventing leaks and ensuring ease of use.

Many 20 ounce bottles come with a variety of lid options, including screw-top lids, flip-top lids, and straw lids. Screw-top lids offer the most secure seal and are ideal for carrying liquids in a bag. Flip-top lids provide quick and easy access to your beverage, making them suitable for workouts or other activities. Straw lids are convenient for sipping on the go and are often preferred for cold drinks. The lid material and construction are also important factors to consider, as they can affect durability and resistance to leaks.

**Size and Portability:** The 20 ounce size strikes a balance between capacity and portability.

A standard 20 ounce bottle typically measures around 8-10 inches in height and 2.5-3 inches in diameter. This size is compact enough to fit in most cup holders and backpack pockets, making it convenient to carry around throughout the day. Some bottles also feature a loop or handle for added portability. The weight of the bottle is another factor to consider, especially if you plan to carry it for extended periods. Stainless steel bottles tend to be heavier than Tritan plastic or glass bottles.

Key features of the leading 20 ounce bottles include:

* Durable construction with high-quality materials
* Advanced insulation technology for temperature retention
* Leak-proof lid designs with various options
* Compact and portable size suitable for daily use

 ## Core Benefits

The benefits of using a high-quality 20 ounce bottle extend beyond simply carrying beverages. They contribute to a healthier lifestyle, environmental sustainability, and cost savings.

**Hydration on the Go:** A 20 ounce bottle provides a convenient way to stay hydrated throughout the day. Having a readily available source of water encourages frequent sips, which is essential for maintaining optimal health and energy levels. Many people find that they drink more water when they have a reusable bottle with them, compared to relying on disposable cups or infrequent water fountain visits.

**Environmental Sustainability:** Reusable 20 ounce bottles significantly reduce reliance on single-use plastic bottles. By choosing a reusable option, you can help minimize plastic waste and its harmful impact on the environment. Single-use plastic bottles contribute to pollution in landfills and oceans, harming wildlife and ecosystems. Using a reusable bottle is a simple but effective way to make a positive contribution to environmental sustainability.

**Cost Savings:** Investing in a durable 20 ounce bottle can save money in the long run. Instead of constantly buying bottled water or other beverages, you can fill your reusable bottle with tap water or prepare your own drinks at home. This can result in significant savings over time, especially for those who regularly purchase bottled beverages. The initial cost of a high-quality bottle is quickly offset by the savings on disposable alternatives.

**Temperature Control:** Insulated 20 ounce bottles keep drinks cold or hot for hours. This is particularly beneficial for those who enjoy iced coffee or hot tea on the go. Maintaining the desired temperature enhances the taste and enjoyment of beverages, making it easier to stay hydrated or caffeinated throughout the day. The ability to keep drinks cold or hot also reduces the need for ice or reheating, further contributing to convenience and cost savings.

 ## FAQs Section

This section addresses some common questions about 20 ounce bottles.

**Are all 20 ounce bottles dishwasher safe?**
  Not all 20 ounce bottles are dishwasher safe. Stainless steel bottles are generally dishwasher safe, but it is always recommended to check the manufacturer's instructions.

Always consult the care instructions before placing your bottle in the dishwasher.

**How do I clean my 20 ounce bottle effectively?**
  For thorough cleaning, use warm soapy water and a bottle brush. Pay attention to the lid and any crevices where bacteria can accumulate. For stubborn stains or odors, you can use a mixture of baking soda and water or vinegar and water. Allow the mixture to sit in the bottle for several hours before rinsing thoroughly. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the bottle's surface or insulation.

**What is the best material for retaining temperature in a 20 ounce bottle?**
  Stainless steel is the best material for retaining temperature in a 20 ounce bottle. Double-walled vacuum-insulated stainless steel bottles can keep drinks cold for up to 24 hours or hot for up to 12 hours. This is significantly better than Tritan plastic or glass bottles, which do not offer the same level of insulation. Copper linings can further enhance the insulation performance of stainless steel bottles.

**How long will a 20 ounce bottle typically last?**
  The lifespan of a 20 ounce bottle depends on the material and how well it is cared for. Stainless steel bottles are the most durable and can last for many years with proper care. Tritan plastic bottles are also durable but may be more prone to scratches or cracks over time. Glass bottles are the most fragile and may need to be replaced more frequently. Regular cleaning and avoiding drops or impacts can help extend the lifespan of your bottle.
