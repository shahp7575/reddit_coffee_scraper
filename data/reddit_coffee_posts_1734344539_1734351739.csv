1hfhjvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/FeetFinderTalk/comments/1hfhjvc/is_there_a_feetfinder_app/,Is there a FeetFinder app?,"Ever found yourself wondering ‚Äúdoes FeetFinder have an app‚Äù or asking ‚Äúis there a Feet Finder app‚Äù? Here‚Äôs the scoop: while the Feet Finder app doesn‚Äôt exist (yet), the platform is still incredibly easy to access and navigate through its website. In this blog, I‚Äôll share why FeetFinder doesn‚Äôt need an app to thrive, how it remains one of the top platforms for feet content, and tips for getting started. Keep reading to find out more!



Does FeetFinder have an app for phones? This is the question that most FeetFinder users have at some point during their trip.



So many things have apps now; you can order pizza, find the right dress, and a lot more. In general, apps for our phones have become very important to our daily lives. As you may be thinking, what about the interesting world of people who love feet?



This is the question that everyone who wants to use FeetFinder's services and perks has. Don't worry, though. We are going to answer your question and point you in the right direction.



To begin, we will talk about everything you need to know to download the FeetFinder app for iPhone or Android.



Why do so many people want the FeetFinder app?

There are a lot of people who want to download the FeetFinder app, but we'll give you the main ones.



1. Easy to Get To

On websites, you need to open a browser and type in the website's URL. With mobile apps, you don't have to do that. First things first, an app lets you take your love of feet with you when you travel. You can do some foot content whenever and wherever you want, like while you're at a coffee shop, with friends, or just waiting for the bus. One reason people look for ""FeetFinder app download"" is for this reason.



2. Customized experience for each user

With an app, you can tailor information and experiences to each user based on how they use and what they like. This customization can make users more interested and satisfied.



3. Notifications Right Away

You're always up to date with an app. Get alerts right away when you get texts, new followers, or sales. Don't wait any longer for that exciting ping! It lets you know right away when someone messages you or starts to like you on the app. You get a rush of energy right away, and it keeps you interested.



4. Click, swipe, and sell

An app speeds up the whole process. With just a few taps, you can swipe through your foot pictures, click to share them, and take care of your listings. Like a breeze for selling things on foot! It's very easy to manage your foot pictures if you have a lot of them to sell. With just a few taps, you can change, add to, or remove items. It's never been so easy to keep your goods in great shape.



5. Sell while you're out and about

Your foot-selling game shouldn't stop either, because life doesn't. With just a few taps, you can view your ads and make sales while on the bus, at the park, or hanging out with friends. It's like having your own shop on wheels to sell shoes! That's why people use Google to look for the FeetFinder app download.



Even though there isn't a Feet Finder app yet, selling pictures of your feet can still be as easy as scrolling through your favorite social media feed. The FeetFinder website will make it easy for you to sell your foot content, giving you more time to do the important things in your life. It's as simple as swipe, click, and sell!



Before we talk about why people download the FeetFinder app, let's talk about the big question: why do people download it?



Getting the FeetFinder app‚ÄîDoes it Really Exist?

This is bad news if you were planning to download the FeetFinder app: there isn't one yet. You read that right. Does FeetFinder have an app? Unfortunately, no. What's the reason for this? Google and Apple don't let adult apps be in their app stores. While FeetFinder doesn't allow naked photos of people, it does advertise the sale of sexy foot pictures, so it is still considered adult.



That's why you won't be able to find a FeetFinder app to download. You can get to the page, though, using the browser on your phone or computer. The website's design is so simple and easy to use that once you start using it, you won't want to go back.



The FeetFinder app is always being looked for in the app shop, though. For the love of our one million users, we will make a FeetFinder app for Android and iPhone users as soon as the Google and Apple app shops say it's okay. You can keep making money from its website until then.



Oh, and there's news for you guys. Is there a Feet Finder app? Not yet, but the company announced plans for a Progressive Web App back in 2020. There are people who don't know that a Progressive Web App is a mix of web pages and mobile apps. The best things about a PWA are how fast it is, how it can work offline, and how it can be accessed right from the computer.



They also said that people could use their website like an app by going to it straight away. Another important thing to remember is that any app that says it is connected to FeetFinder is a fake. Do not fall for it ever. We will definitely let our users know about our website if we ever make one.



Okay, now that we've talked about the FeetFinder app, let's talk about why people like it.



Why do people like FeetFinder? Does it work like an app?

FeetFinder is one of the best and most used places to sell pictures of feet. The main idea behind it is to bring foot mavericks together and let them make money by monetizing their material. Buyers are free to look at pictures and buy them for no cost. But artists have to pay a subscription fee, which could be anywhere from $3.99 to $14.99 per month. You will not be able to use the service unless you pay this fee. FeetFinder also has extra features for people who make content. These extra features cost $9.99 a month or $29.99 a year. There are other sites like FunWithFeet that let you sell feet, but they aren't as reputable. There are pros and cons to selling pictures of your feet that you should always think about before you start on any site.



And on FeetFinder, everyone from housewives to college grads is getting rich and learning more about how the platform can be used. You can read FeetFinder reviews to see if they are reliable. People love FeetFinder for many reasons. Let's look into a few of them.



1. Precise to a niche

FeetFinder is a website that is all about feet. On most social media sites, lots of different topics and hobbies compete for people's attention. FeetFinder, on the other hand, brings together people who are all interested in feet. This unique focus makes it possible for users to connect deeply and meaningfully with each other.



2. Expression through art

There is a new kind of art that has grown out of FeetFinder. As if feet were works of art, sellers often take shots of them that look good. The beauty and creativity in these pictures are what make them so appealing.



3. A Place Without Judgments

Many people who are interested in feet find it hard to talk about their hobby because of how society treats them. If you want to talk about your hobbies openly without fear of criticism or cheap judgments, FeetFinder is the place for you. I think this is especially important for niche groups where acceptance can play a big role.



4. Health and safety

Businesses that sell feet pictures need to know who th sell pictures of your feet. Most buyers and sellers, on the other hand, said that FeetFinder is a safe place to buy and sell pictures of feet without much worry. It does what it says it will do by requiring all foot content sellers to show a legal photo ID to prove who they are.

her you're a foot model, an artist, or just someone with great feet. You can also make some extra money while you're at it! If you have skills (and feet), why not show them off and get paid for it? This app is like an art gallery for your feet. There are people who really like how pretty feet are and might even pay for it. FeetFinder helps you find people who like your feet and want to connect with you.



6. Program for Referrals

One appealing thing about FeetFinder is that it has a referral scheme that can help you make more money. You can ask for a unique reference code when you sign up for FeetFinder. If you give your friends this code and they use it to sign up, you'll get a nice 10% fee from their sales. This 10% doesn't come from your friends' earnings; it comes straight from FeetFinder's fee. However, the chances of making money don't end there! You'll make even more money when the people you referred bring in more people to make more money for themselves. It's like a wave of money!



7. It works just like an app

Have you ever wished that your best way to sell things on foot could be as quick and easy as a cool app? FeetFinder heard you and chose to make your dreams come true if you love feet. FeetFinder is a great website that works just like an app. It has a lot of useful functions and makes it easy to use them, just like an app.



That's why FeetFinder is the first choice for a lot of people. And if you want to do well on FeetFinder, you can use their information center to find out what they do that works.



In conclusion

There are many places to find ideas and sell pictures of feet. FeetFinder can be your own personal gig economy. You decide what to sell, how much to charge, and when and how to connect with your fans. FeetFinder's way of making money works for everyone, whether you want to turn your hobby into a business, show off your artistic side, or just meet people who share your interests.

  


You'll have to wait if you want to download the FeetFinder app for iTunes or Google Play. There's no reason not to. And if Google and Apple ever change their rules, you will see the FeetFinder app for sure. At the moment, the only thing you can do on FeetFinder is make money. That's not a bad choice, then.



I hope this blog has answered your questions about the *Feet Finder app* and clarified why the platform doesn‚Äôt currently offer one. If you‚Äôve ever asked *‚Äúdoes FeetFinder have an app‚Äù* or wondered *‚Äúis there a Feet Finder app‚Äù*, the answer is simple: while there‚Äôs no app, the website provides everything you need to explore, connect, and succeed.

I am in love with the cozy, slice of life, feel good books. So far my favorite have been:

- Before the coffee get cold series
- what you are looking for is in the library
- welcome to the hyunam-dong bookshop

I am currently looking for recs for ssimilar books but with a bakery (or cafe if easier) settings instead. 
Or if you have a cozy book you like with a different settings please type it out still. I just preferred the bakery/cafe setting at the moment due to my recent obsession with baking haha

Doesn't have to be from Japan or Korea like my favorite books above, as long as it is available in English (and preferably Kobo as well).

It's just for fun, not to deny the original order! This is my version, do you think it fits ?

1. Drink or Coffee - she meets someone and fall il love

2. Number one girl - they're not in relationship yet but she wants to

3. APT - they get closer, very fun because it's the beginning 

4. 3am - she sees redflags but otherwise the relationship seems good and she's not ready to give it up

5. Stay a little longer - they get a bit more distant but the emotional dependence is real

6. Not a same - she takes a step back and realises that he fcked up 

7. Game boy - same as 6, she's tired that he gives nothing back and cried a lot

8. Call it the end - she talks to him and wondering if they still have a future together 

9. Too bad for us - they broke up and it feels like a desert now that he's gone, a lot of sadness

10. Two years - 2 years later it's still hard to move on 

11. Toxic til the end - she finally puts the word ""toxic"" to describe the relationship and the anger is also relieving 

12. Dance all night - she can finally move on and realizes she can also dance by herself (and gives herself flowers lol)

3. In early days he moved around like he is god of universe, knows everything, tells people as time god he will turn back time. Makes a laughing stock of himself outside. L move.

4. In trying to be contrarian and making a separation from KV for himself he forcefully goes and sides with Avinash when the whole house was against him, the chugli gang rubs off on him and to sound cool among them he bad mouths everyone, specially KV, calling him low tier, joke, can't do shit and whatnot just to fit in. All this about someone who he said he considered a ""friend"". Massive L.

5. In the Farah Khan week after 8-10 weeks of KV bashing the sun finally shines on him, makers reward him for having sustained that pressure for so long, Vivian as always is dumbfounded. His whole world goes for a spin. Vivian who thought the Sun revolves around him was so rattled that he went into a shell. Massive L.

6. This week again he is bashed because basis last week Avinash changes himself too fast and Vivian went further into a shell. (If u remember, DV and KV have faced such weekends a lot more and they have either endured, stayed true to their real self or even if made changes they have been gradual and earned, something both avinash and vivian can't seem to crack). Massive L.

7. Now his wife comes and tells him to take a stand and the fool still goes after karan and shilpa for no reason when infact he should have gone after eisha atleast (if avinash couldn't be nominated) for betraying his trust. L of the highest order.

8. Now he is seen in the live feed wandering around like a grumpy uncle going to everyone and telling them, you did not tell me i was going wrong, how can u not tell me and then say i am not going wrong to salman sir, basically ""meri shikayat kyun lagayi saaaloo""? When the fact is Karan was the first to point out to him that among the kids of chugli gang he is looking out of place, does not suit his level, he should be the main man but does not seem like it, Shilpa for all her faults also pointed to him that look u selectively act but he was high on his own farts so never took anyone seriously, now why is he crying to them that they did not guide him well. MASSIVE MASSIVE LAME L

Hi, Mike! Love your videos! Oh, and Charlotte too! ;D (I am kidding! Congrats on the Wedding!) This is not a favourite Wedding-Drama, but an all-set WAR going on between my parents (mostly my badass mom) and our Karen of a neighbour.¬†

I do not expect to pass in a video but I can see how this is affecting my mother emotionally, so I need your support, oh great subjects of our all-grandess Petty Queen!

Prepare your popcorn and hot chocolate because this is a long one!

  


First: FOR CONTEXT



The area on which this mess is centred is very isolated. It is at the edge of a public forest and in between villages. It is very calm, aside from the occasional lost cars and hikers.¬†

Once upon a time, almost all the houses were owned by one man, who still lives here, separated them and sold them individually.¬†

I should mention, that my parents have lived here for 20+ years. My father‚Äôs (50+) job has required him to move us out of the country throughout my childhood. Despite our back and forth, we‚Äôve always managed to keep our house and always have tried to keep communication with the people living there (with our house, 7 little houses).¬†

But, unlike us, most of our neighbours have rarely travelled far.

So our neighbours are (brief intro):

* An Airbnb at the beginning, lively and fun.
* An educator and her sons.
* A kind old lady who has all sorts of animals right next to our house
* The other family glued to us, never got out of their house, pale, blond, and their kitchen light was always turned on at night. Mini-Me‚Äôs little imagination nicknamed them the Vampires.
* The previous owner of the land, despite not being someone you wanna mess with, is super sweet (and has a sculptor son who, I‚Äôve just learned worked on the restoration of Notre Dame‚Äôs statues, good job!), we‚Äôll call him Monsieur M.
* The Furthest house is a family, we‚Äôll call them V.

(FWI If you wonder where I (20, f) am in the story: I was living in the fog during the drama, not everyone is as emotionally stable as our Petty Queen!)



ANYWAY, on to the story!¬†



The Vampires moved.¬†

The state of the house was DISASTROUS. To give you an idea: in fifteen years I haven‚Äôt seen them¬†*once*¬†mow their loan (maybe once but I probably just dreamt it), so my bedroom view, when I got tall enough to reach it, was more like a jungle and a house with four levels with a balcony falling apart. (Nickname makes more sense now? ;)

After years, they miraculously managed to sell to a recently city-divorced (30?) woman, her daughter, her new companion and his daughter.¬†

If you guessed this woman is our all-famous, infuriating Karen of our story: you win an Eclair!

Believe it or not, at the very beginning, I was *thrilled*! I had grown up in these woods and I could not wait to see a newly formed family and their girls live the same happiness I had!

My parents even organised a little welcome party for them and invited all of our neighbours to include them in our little secluded neighbourhood! (Back that event in your mind for later)

Then, they started working on repairing the house! I was so happy to see people coming and going. My mom confided she had a bad feeling about Karen, but 18-year-old me just rolled my eyes thinking she was just being dramatic.



OH! How ***WRONG*** I was!



Well, time goes by, and I have my education abroad. Imagine my surprise, when my parents found upon their return that Karen was burning down¬†*our*¬†wooden fence without us knowing! Mind you it was a very old, small fence but wtf?

I assumed it was a mistake. After all, we weren‚Äôt there, but I did think it odd: for something separating both properties, shouldn‚Äôt she have texted my parents?¬†

That is not all, since she was burning other materials from the house causing a terrible, intoxicating smoke attracting angry-smoke consumed neighbours. But Karen just¬†*smiled*¬†and said it would be over soon.¬†

‚ÄúSoon‚Äù lasted **3** days!¬†

The first spark that was burning away my little fantasy of Karen‚Äôs peaceful and entertaining family.¬†

¬†

The fence was not the only thing separating our properties, but a tall, large, long hedge my parents had been trimming (on¬†*both*¬†sides) for years. Karen announces that she is going to remove it.

I asked my parents ‚ÄúBut didn‚Äôt you tell me you planted that hedge when you moved in? Isn‚Äôt that on our property?‚Äù¬†



Why yes. Yes, it is.



A lot of questions were thrown around but the main one was: is the hedge on our property?

My mom calls the first owner of our house, she drags Monsieur M into the mix. They all tell her the same thing: the hedge is on¬†*our*¬†side. Mind you, the previous owner of our place said he was the one who planted the fence Karen burned down and it was 100% on our side. She has yet to pay us back for it.

Karen calls the Vampires. The Vampires, who never got out of their house once! Tell her that they¬†*think*¬†the hedge might be on her side and she is all convinced the hedge is hers.

Not Monsieur M. Not my parents, even when they¬†*WARN HER*¬†they are pretty certain that they own more of the field than it seems.¬†

Apparently, back when the first owner sold my parents the land, Monsieur M still lived in Karen‚Äôs house, and he‚Ä¶ ‚Äútook‚Äù parts of my parent‚Äôs property with another fence of his own. My parents didn‚Äôt argue, why would they? They are good people, they weren‚Äôt gonna argue with their new neighbour about it.¬†

So long story short:¬†*everyone*¬†told Karen that the hedge was ours. But she must be a goldfish swimming in a bocal because she either couldn‚Äôt hear us or simply didn‚Äôt care.

At this point I am actually really concerned: if Karen literally burned¬†*our*¬†property when we were gone: what else is she gonna do?

Subjects of the Petty Queen, this moment, which I shall remember ALLLL my life, is when I saw something in my mother that was¬†*murderous!*¬†She had enough playing the understanding neighbour: Game on!¬†

I knew that Karen was pretty much f\*cked

My Mother declares that whatever we say: Karen is not going to listen. So my dad sends a¬†*recommender*¬†(a legal warning if you want) that if ANYTHING was moved on OUR property we will be taking her to court!

Karen planned to add cement to her property. She must not understand how hills work because guess where that cement hard or liquid would fall on?¬†

I think Karen wants to destroy our property.¬†

My parents have enough so they all agree to do a bornage, a historic review of the property which demonstrates which side of the property belongs to whom.

I later learned that Karen claimed she had money troubles, so my parents agreed she‚Äôd cover ‚Öì of the cost and leave the rest to them. TBF I am 100% sure they didn‚Äôt believe her sob story, they just wanted to be over with it.

That is when Charlotte‚Äôs favourite best friend shows up. Do you remember Karma? She is pretty, she is petty and she is present!¬†

Well, it turns out, Karen should have listened to my parents‚Äô warnings because we don‚Äôt just have the hedge on our side, we own so much of what she thought was her property! HA HA!

Mind you, as the guy from the Bornage gives the verdict, she glues herself to him in a tall, threatening position, repeating the question ‚ÄúAre you sure? Are you absolutely sure?‚Äù Yes, Karen! It‚Äôs his job! Don‚Äôt kill him!

Well, this whole territory drama made me give her a new nickname that sounds an awful lot like her real name, but my mother must have thought it clever because she adopted it immediately. But I‚Äôll keep it to myself if you don‚Äôt mind. ;)



¬†¬†

Oh, you think this is over? We are just getting started, people! I don‚Äôt know if anyone‚Äôs still interested, but now would be the time for a little coffee break.

You‚Äôre good? Good.



Because we‚Äôre not. I have seen my mother crumble at the works of that Karen!

I should have known that the territory dispute was just a sideshow at how the nightmare that would follow!¬†

I watched her house with a suspicious eye and realised that ninety per cent of the time it was quiet as if they weren‚Äôt living there. Well: they¬†*aren‚Äôt!*



I confront my mom and that is when I find out¬†*everything:*

Back when my mother first went up to invite Karen to that party at the beginning, she knocked on her door to introduce herself. Karen opened the upstairs window, and said in a tone that wouldn‚Äôt even be fitting when addressing an angry child: ‚ÄúThe doorbell works you know.‚Äù¬†

After that lovely greeting, a rather awkward conversation followed. My mother inquired if she was going to turn this place into a Guest House, but she denied it with a cheery smile.¬†



What about the Welcome Party?

Well, I had taken it upon myself to babysit Karen‚Äôs daughter, (and while thinking back, her companion and his daughter not showing up was a¬†*huge*¬†red flag) Karen was boasting about her¬†*education*¬†and how her position in communication made the company quote: ‚Äúcannot survive without her‚Äù.

FWI I am told my father, who works in Human Resources, was starting to get a pretty good idea about who they were going to live with for the next ten years.



I bet you all must be wondering: what is Karen‚Äôs goal in coming here? Well, kudos to my mother‚Äôs Force-Sight because she was 200% right about the Guest House plan!¬†

There‚Äôs just one little thing: in my country, you¬†*have*¬†to live in a guest house, otherwise what you are running is an AirBNB and the¬†*prices*¬†to run a Guest House happen to be¬†*significantly*¬†lower than an AirBNB.¬†

Well, remember the fact I barely saw the children outside? Karen and her companion live elsewhere, in one of the nearby villages. And yes, that‚Äôs technically illegal but you understand: they don‚Äôt want to be woken up by travellers they *tell* can arrive at dawn with noisy cars. Not that‚Äôs only for the light sleepers like my mom to be bothered by that.



People, we call women ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù because they‚Äôre crazy but a¬†*manipulating*¬†Karen who works in communication is the worst!¬†



When Karen got her first customers, my mom, like Marinette Dupain-Chen on one of her psychotic breaks, listened in as they left. They were wishing her ‚Äúgood luck with the mean woman next door‚Äù. So she‚Äôs talking shit about my mom to her customers.

Even better, my mom is spying on her reviews, the first review she ever got, where the customer ratted her out for not being present (because you know AirBNB-Guest House has different expectations), she also called out Karen for being rude and not giving her back her money. Well, that review mysteriously disappeared after a couple of months.

Her customers aren‚Äôt the only ones she‚Äôs talking crap about my mom to. People, she has managed to turn¬†*everyone* in the neighbourhood against us. How? Well, of course, the isolated lonely single mother with pets can‚Äôt possibly be evil.¬†



I never thought I would understand Alastor‚Äôs lesson about smiling the hard way.¬†(And that killed me to write that, Alastor is best character!)



Why is she being nice to the neighbours, especially the old lady with animals? Well, she‚Äôs a busy woman! She can‚Äôt be expected to bring back the animals she bought solely for her Guest House when they run off! No no no! That‚Äôs up to the peasants who've never gotten out of the village to do that.¬†

Poor Ponies‚Ä¶

Karen only bought them as a business expense, but I just recently learned HOW much she doesn‚Äôt care about them¬†*at all.*¬†

My mom and sister (25) bumped into an old friend who is a horse expert yesterday, and she needed a place to put her horses for a while. Horses can damage a field but my mom offered our garden and while she seemed interested in the offer she suddenly asked if we lived next to Karen. And a whole lot of truth came out.¬†

Karen‚Äôs ponies escaped to see her horses. Why? Because Karen‚Äôs animals aren‚Äôt castrated. Which is why she can‚Äôt have her horses next to hers and refused my mom‚Äôs offer. When they escaped the first time, Karen expected the Expert to put her escaped animals back in her place for her (no surprises there from Entitled Karen) but the Expert saw loads of red flags:¬†

First: Karen does not take her animals to the vet (wtf?)

Second, she didn‚Äôt castrate them, her reasoning? ‚ÄúWell, they‚Äôre brother and sister, it‚Äôs fine!‚Äù Karen! Animals aren‚Äôt humans! I bet she learned that the hard way because she now has a third baby pony that my sister calls Charles III or Cleopatra just to make her point.

Third! Karen‚Äôs ponies don‚Äôt have enough grass to eat, which could explain why they keep escaping because they‚Äôre hungry. And what does Karen do about it? Why: nothing of course!

The Expert wanted to call (equivalent) Animal Control, but the old kind lady who lives next door to us has a pony of her own who lives in a large field¬†*alone*. And that‚Äôs bad for a pony to be alone and while the Kind-Old lady is with him all the time, the Expert didn‚Äôt want the risk of Animal Control taking it away too.¬†



Meanwhile, Karen is a sore loser because as soon as the bornage verdict came out, Karen has been spreading rumours about our family and most especially my mom. How do we know? A childhood friend of mine overheard the conversation between two people she knew and having been at my house before she knew exactly who the conversation was about, and more truth came out.

Do you remember Karen‚Äôs ex-husband?

Well, turns out she managed to turn his own family against him. Guys, I **KNOW** that divorce can be messy, and it‚Äôs not right to take sides without the whole story. But‚Ä¶ seeing how Karen spread lies about my mom, can you blame me if I have doubts the culprit was that poor man? But I won‚Äôt tell my family what I think, that‚Äôs Karen‚Äôs own private business.



Back to our sheep!¬†



You think it can‚Äôt get any worse: it can trust me, it can! What else could Karen possibly destroy that we adore in our area?¬†



Why: the *forest*, of course!



My Sherlock Mom, losing sleep over this, checks her account and websites regularly and discovers Karen is planning to upgrade the number of beds in her little business. Only one thing: what about the cars? Where are gonna put them?¬†

My mom saw her boyfriend and his father cleaning up the forest in front of the house.

Yes, people. She planned to transform a public forest into her parking lot.

Mind you there was no WAY we would allow it to happen and even more, her cleaning up caused flooding into our house (thanks, Karen!).



Enters: the mayor.



At first, we find out the mayor¬†*hates her*. (I laughed, mind you!) She used her manipulations on him and it didn‚Äôt work. Oh, did I mention Karen‚Äôs mom? Vice President of the County. Well, when the mayor received her phone calls about Karen‚Äôs ‚Äúinnocent little project‚Äù (his words) he told them to f\*ck off.

Why, was he mad? Because Karen‚Äôs clients park their cars where she told them to! In the fire lane area where the garbage tow-trucks turn around. Guess who didn‚Äôt show up for a month because they had enough of waking up everyone in the street at six am in the morning? By that time, a lot of the neighbours were starting to wake up to her BS, except the Vs.¬†



We tried to buy the area of the forest, but it turns out, we can‚Äôt. It belongs to the city and so following our warning, the area will be fenced.



Do you think it's over? It‚Äôs ***still*** not over people!



A Guest House is good, but a coffee place is better!



It‚Äôs a nightmare people, she wants to extend her business for wine tasting. Turns out the mayor is not as much on our side than we thought. He‚Äôs a politician, he‚Äôll do anything to please everyone until he goes forward with his career. So basically, he tells my mom one thing, but he tells Karen another.

Well, why is he still in this story? She needs a permit for her little business and she needs to make her business official. She has it, but she was required to the neighbourhood about it.

So the mayor, my parents and all our neighbours had some kind of official meeting, which my parents had to attend by Zoom¬†*but*¬†turns out they didn‚Äôt have to! A friend of theirs, who‚Äôs also the father of another childhood friend of mine, offered to represent them and my mom gave him¬†*everything*¬†she collected about Karen‚Äôs little project. Meanwhile, Karen was saying she wanted to do a small wine-tasting area, nothing more.

Nothing more?

The activities, the hiking, the coffee place, the employees, everything she offered was nothing¬†*more*?¬†

And how did Karen plan to bring her customers over? With large, very large buses.¬†People, the forest, would have to be¬†*trimmed*¬†for buses like that to come up to our area, let alone park.¬†

And boy the face he described she had when he laid down the facts. Karen stopped talking¬†*very*¬†quickly like a child being grounded on Thanksgiving! How did my mom discover so much? Well, it's all on Karen‚Äôs media platforms!¬†

She was just telling one part of the truth not to lie down that she was turning our home into her business field.¬†



So that‚Äôs where we are so far.



My parents are exhausted people, and they would have nothing against Karen‚Äôs business if she stopped lying to them and everyone over and over. Heck,¬†*we*¬†own an Airbnb!

I want them to know they aren‚Äôt alone, I don‚Äôt expect much advice against someone like this but I do hope I show them some support.

If you make it to the end, I congratulate you! And Charlotte, Mike congratulations again on the wedding! I did not receive a physical invite :‚Äô) But we are your guests spiritually!¬†

I miss you, Babe, and Christmas is coming üéÑ Maybe I'll wake up and find me a nice wrapped Landin under our tree (which would be hilarious given you're about 95 percent bigger than our tree) but I'd be ALL the okay with that.

1. Carlin and Evan continued to do basic Dubai events all week like rug shop, camel ride and hang at Top Golf. Meanwhile, Layla and Zade Stewart were enrolled at Auntie Michael‚Äôs bootcamp for wayward influencer kids. They were required to wear real clothing-no pajamas or nylon princess gowns, sit at the table and eat real home cooked food-no Chick-fil-A or Starbucks, and take turns speaking. By the time their parents FaceTimed them Layla was so exhausted she couldn‚Äôt even plaster her fake excited face on for the camera. When Carlin and Evan finally get home they immediately take the kids to a Disney movie and get the cameras and lights back up in the house so the content train can keep rolling. Apparently, Carlin brought home a case of the Traveler‚Äôs Trots and needed an IV of fluids to bring her back to life just in time for her Georgia influencer buddy Sophie to show up for church(aka second filming location)

2. Katie Clark really went all in this week on the feel good content. Travis and Katie brought Kelly Jo a car that Harvey and Hailey bought‚Ä¶ and filmed it from every possible angle for maximum monetization. The best part was a somewhat emasculated Gil Bates blubbering in the background. If that wasn‚Äôt enough, they also dropped a video of Katie visiting her grandparents at the farm. They were able to exploit both children and old people this week and use the footage to push a powdered vitamin supplement. Katie and Travis took Christmas pics rigged up in the Mormon chick‚Äôs dresses that Alyssa normally wears, and Katie tells us she and Hailey were back at the mall again, aimlessly walking around while Travis is gone on his tour of churches. Katie, the kids and Kelly all make it to one of Travis‚Äô shows, but bail midway through. Katie is in some nondescript hotel with 2 kids and her mom and she looks like she could collapse. Everything comes with a price, Katie Grace. Pop that smile back on bc you have to figure out how to top all of this. 

3.  Josie continued to amp up her exploitation of Willow this week and featured her cooking pizza and narrating the steps to her mom‚Äôs latest sourdough obsession. Josie was home alone as Kelton is out of town again but she still manages to whip up cookies, sell makeup brushes and the hair noodle‚Ä¶& all while throwing her yearly party for the girls who work for her. We see Josie with a pro blowout slinging a huge beef tenderloin on the grill, baby wearing, making bottles and still managing to capture her friends from every angle. Lydia is the only Bates at the party for the 3rd year in a row. Not to be outdone by her traveling sisters, Josie convinces her friends/employees to travel to NYC with her to see the Rockettes and pose in every major tourist spot. Smile! Merry Christmas!

4. Down in Orlando it‚Äôs week 2 of Alyssa‚Äôs self imposed social media break. The sad hat has been forgotten but the website is still up. When can we call it officially over?? Alyssa does still want her YouTube check which is about $79 these days. We see the girls decorating cookies with that one church friend and her kids. It‚Äôs a military precision event with Alyssa refusing to let Maci hold the icing and John‚Äôs goofy azz lurking around in the background. Later they go look at Christmas lights and everyone gets to leave the car to go pick up Alyssa‚Äôs coffee order. The girls are over the top excited to be out anywhere and Alyssa behaves as if the 4 hot chocolates she preordered are as exciting as a trip to Disney. Rhett does the same thing he does every week‚Ä¶ cries. 4 screaming girls is a lot, little buddy. Warden is in town and stops in with doughnuts and agrees to take a picture with Alyssa. Warden is wearing a hat and guess which hat it is NOT?? Allie got to help John‚Äôs mom decorate her Christmas Tree. Allie cuts and rolls her eyes at Alyssa a lot‚Ä¶ when she isn‚Äôt dealing with the baby. Up next is the sad Christmas where everyone opens shoes and magnets. Can‚Äôt wait.

5. Whitney shares pictures and videos from her NYC trip and gushes over Zach allowing her to go. She shows Bradley dancing in the Subway and somewhere Gil Bates is white knuckling his phone. Whitney, the woman who has a house filled with linkable items, tells us that moments are worth more than merchandise.  Ellie stayed with Zach to help with the younger three kids and they make deep dish pizza. Zach is back in the Bates Kitchen which is sponsored by a security camera. Apparently that camera can‚Äôt offer overhead shots or close ups either bc we still only get one angle from Zach. Surprise, surprise‚Ä¶ Zach is cooking steak again. This time with a wedge salad but he replaces every ingredient in the salad with basic, boring stuff like shredded cheese and ranch. He cross contaminates to his hearts content and then throws it all on top of a mound of mashed potatoes. Whitney and Zach celebrate 11 years of marriage. 11 years, 5 kids and about 4 faces between them. Pictures don‚Äôt lie. 

6. Lydia Bates knows how to grab the internet‚Äôs attention. She shared a reel showing her weight training during the first trimester of her pregnancy and the comments lit up. She says she threw up during and after every workout‚Ä¶ good for her, I guess. She and Trace have a new vlog which features the 2 of them talking to the camera. Trace pushes Lydia to talk but she mostly tucks her head and giggles nervously. They simultaneously tell us how awful the first trimester was with Trace gone on his fake hero trip and Lydia sick as a dog but also how amazing and wonderful it was bc Lydia had lots of family help and Trace was saving the world. Trace fully admits he could have come home at any time‚Ä¶& Lydia says she still ‚Äúhad‚Äù to put out the weekly vlog and it was super duper hard. So much sympathy for them‚Ä¶ not. Addee shows up to babysit Ryker so Lydia and Trace can attend a wedding. Michael, Addee and Ellie are stretched thin this month. 


7. While Michael was busy deprogramming the Stewart kids, Brandon escaped to his house to film the Keilen‚Äôs latest vlog. He set up a huge piece of plywood in his kitchen and step by step showed how to make strawberry pretzel salad while wearing a tracksuit and a baseball cap. Brandon has closeups, overhead shots and edits so Zach better watch out. He still licked the spoon and his fingers though. 

8. Erin has been busy burning and turning. You may think with packing but you would be wrong. She‚Äôs in the kitchen mixing beef fat with MLM oils to try and make some coin. Her first batch sold out fast and she needs to take advantage of December sales. It was all hands on deck. The only Bates available to help was the youngest JebJud, so he had to do. Erin took a break to go visit some Christmas lights and try to play it off that they are a happy family and that Chad loves her. It appears that most of her product was sent to other trad wife influencers‚Ä¶ for free. They all feature the products on their sites. Addee finally showed up to help pack and the girls received new frocks from that weird fan that Erin calls a friend. The Paine Christmas tree is full of wrapped gifts. Could it be camping supplies for their next ‚Äúhome‚Äù??

9.  Lawson Bates loves to put the camera directly in his face and smile the cheesiest smile ever. He is selling an app called Bible chat ‚Ä¶just what everyone wants ‚Ä¶a conversation with Lawson about the Bible. He and Tiffy are still in California making the rounds introducing Baby Will to her family. They obviously stumbled upon a dude ranch while visiting Joshua Tree and that gave Lawson the grand idea to film a western Christmas music video. What you wind up with is Lawson looking like howdy duty standing beside a very embarrassed horse while yodeling. I don‚Äôt even have words to describe this cringe worthy, embarrassing monstrosity‚Ä¶ the least of which is his terrible singing. Tiffy stood by and watched as this grown azz man, the leader of her family, got all rigged up like Little Joe Cartwright and pretend played cowboy while a camera rolled. Who is the audience for this? Nevermind‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt tell me. 
10. Kelly Jo was a full on influencer this week‚Ä¶ she happily promoted Carlin‚Äôs Dubai content, and immediately followed that with promoting Erin‚Äôs content. She praised Erin saying she was teaching her children what is really important‚Ä¶ Was that shade to Carlin? She also hosted a princess party at the Stewart‚Äôs home and invited some of her granddaughters over‚Ä¶ They all were gifted huge boxes of toys and gifts. KJ is the newest Bates sporting an arm brace or cast but that didn‚Äôt slow her down.  She features a reel showing off the car that Katie and Travis gave her, but she also writes and says how grateful she is for all of the gifts that all of her children have given her through the years. You just know she had to say that to try to quell the rising storm of resentment. She spends the rest of the week being the Fundie world‚Äòs Kris Jenner promoting each of her kids as much as possible and you have to wonder if they hand over 10% just like the Kardashians do‚Ä¶

Have an awesome week friends! Any guesses on WHO Lawson and Tiffy are talking about when they say they bet there will be FOUR babies born in 2025??

Hi all! Very new to espresso making! Got my first machine- Gaggia Carezza Deluxe. Went for this as it comes with a pressurized portafilter and from what I understand this should make the grind of the beans ‚Äúless important‚Äù in order to pull a successful shot. To start out, I tried an ‚Äúespresso blend‚Äù pre-ground coffee. This ran through the machine very quickly- around 10-12seconds for 60ml- and the espresso was very acidic. Read that this is likely caused by the grind of coffee being too coarse. I then got an old blade blender out- and followed some videos in how to get a fine blend from beans and got fresh beans and grinded it as fine as I could. Same problem- very quick through the machine and very acidic espresso. Have tried multiple blends now each with the same issue mostly.
My question is however- could it be that there is something wrong with the pressurized portafilter? 
Isn‚Äôt it supposed to work better on a bit of a coarser grind? Or am I missing something?It seems I am troubleshooting the grind size over and over, but avoiding this was kind of the point of getting a pressurized portafilter machine haha. Any help or general advice about pulling espresso would be appreciated! I do know that pressurized portafilters are not as great as non-pressurized, but hoping to at least improve my first setup a bit!",3,1734347575.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

1hfgq1h,https://sacredfootsteps.com/2022/09/07/as-sukkar-azucar-the-bitter-inheritance-of-andalusi-sugar/,"Spain: As-Sukkar, Az√∫car: The Bitter Inheritance of Andalusi Sugar ","As it gradually begins to dawn on consumers that food doesn‚Äôt magically appear on supermarket shelves, the histories of those consumables ‚Äì whose production has been key to capitalism, imperialism, slavery, and the staggering inequalities and entrenched racism of our times ‚Äì also need to be put on the table. Often it is the most everyday commodities that carry the bitterest legacies: we need look no further than coffee or tea, with their obligatory doses of sugar. 

 Ah, sugar. Even the sound of the word feels comforting, like a mother hushing a fractious child, or a lover‚Äôs sweet-talk. It‚Äôs many a Muslim‚Äôs drug  of choice; after a large night out on the baklava I‚Äôve often been visited by  headaches and irritability ‚Äì the Muslim Hangover. 

 But the delirious effects of sucrose mask centuries of atrocities committed  to support the sugar trade. Among the lesser-known episodes of this story is the moment when sugar production passed from Muslim Spain to  Christian Europe, ushering in an unspeakably devastating period of slavery,  loss of human life, and abuse of workforce (not to mention the environment), as well as the development of globalised capitalism and white supremacist theories and policies. 

 Ready to have your sweet tooth pulled? Allow me to scrub up. 

A brief history

 Originally domesticated in Papua New Guinea about 9,000 years ago,  sugarcane was taken by canoe to other Polynesian islands and later to the  Indian subcontinent. Sassanid traders brought to it Persia, planting it as far as the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers in the 4th century CE. When the Arabs  conquered the Persians in 640 CE they had their first heady taste, gradually introducing it to other parts of the Abbasid caliphate and perfecting the manufacture of sugar crystals. Once Crusaders had a taste of the sweet stuff in 12th century Palestine, they were hooked.  

What little sugar there was in medieval Europe was used for medicinal  purposes. The Syrian polymath Ibn al-Nafis and the Andalusi ‚Äúfather of pharmacology‚Äù Ibn al-Baytar wrote extensively about the benefits of sugar  as a ‚Äúhot‚Äù and ‚Äúgentle‚Äù humoral remedy that improved digestion and cured eye infections. Muslim physicians‚Äô expertise was highly esteemed by Christian Europe1 ‚Äì albeit sometimes grudgingly; ‚Äú[s]ixteenth-century  criticisms of sugar by medical authorities may even have formed part of a  fashionable, anti-Islamic partis pris, common in Europe from the Crusades  onward.‚Äù2 

 Sugarcane cultivation wasn‚Äôt suited for northern European climes, making  sugar a luxury import; the average burgher could expect to enjoy no more than a teaspoon of it a year. But with a few adaptations, two areas of  Europe could accommodate it: Sicily and the southern coast of Iberia, both of which were, at the time, under Muslim rule.  

Muslim Spain

While Islamic rule in Sicily ended in 1091 CE, it continued in Al-Andalus  ‚Äì although gradually shrinking ‚Äì for another five centuries. The  Andalusian agronomist Yahya ibn al-Awwam mentions sugarcane in his  12th century canonical text on agronomy, Kitab al-Filaha. The warm, humid  coastal areas of Malaga, Granada and Valencia, became home to green seas of elegantly swaying canes; in 1150 CE, there were 30,000 hectares of cane fields and fourteen sugar mills in the Granada region alone.3 

 After the initial military annexation of most of the Iberian Peninsula,  beginning in 711 CE, came the agricultural revolution. Alongside  numerous varieties of fruit trees and vegetable plants, Muslims also brought herbs and spices like saffron, coriander, cinnamon and aniseed ‚Äì  and the icing on the cake, sugarcane. The etymology of ‚Äòsugar‚Äô reveals this agricultural transfer, via the Old French sukere, Medieval Latin succarum,  Arabic as-sukkar, Persian shakar, all the way back to the Sanskrit sharkara,  meaning ‚Äògravel‚Äô.4 

Hispano-Muslims cultivated sugarcane extensively from the 10th century  onwards. In the Mediterranean Basin, it needed to be watered year-round,  prompting the development of irrigation techniques and water engineering, such as the noria or waterwheel. In the Levant it had also ushered in the practise of sharecropping, or giving farm workers part of the  crop in lieu of payment. 

However, sugarcane also depleted soils, so Andalusi agronomists developed specific techniques to restore fertility. In Granada, At-Tighnari  recommended applying cow manure directly to sugarcane fields, whereas around Seville, Ibn al-Awwam wrote that sheep manure was best, reapplied every eight days at the peak of the growing season.5 

 The Arabs had developed Indian techniques to turn sugarcane ‚Äì a tough skinned member of the grass family, resembling bamboo ‚Äì into non perishable sugar crystals. This laborious process involves crushing the canes, boiling the juice, skimming off impurities, and allowing the molasses to drain out of inverted clay cones, leaving behind unrefined sugar crystals. 

 The end product played a major role in Granada‚Äôs economy, second only to its famous silks.6 The ‚Äúsugar capital‚Äù of the Granada coast was the port of Mutrayil (now Motril), which shipped locally-grown sugar to Genoa. The Spanish word for the sugarcane harvest, zafra, is derived from ÿ≥ŸÅÿ± (journey), as day labourers would travel down from the mountains to cut the cane, trim the leaves ‚Äì which they fed to their donkeys, who repaid this sweet meal with their manure ‚Äì and work the mills.7

 But with the fall of the Emirate of Granada in 1492 CE, all of this would change. 

Christian Iberia

After the Morisco Rebellion, from1568 to 1570 CE, most Cryptomuslims (i.e. those who were forced to practise Islam secretly to avoid persecution) were expelled, their plantations confiscated by the church and the oligarchy of Christian Granada. Mixed orchards were cut down to plant  massive monocultures of sugarcane. Records from this period lament the damage to Valencian sugarcane production after the expulsion of the  Muslims.8

The previous system of smallholdings, owned or rented by peasant farmers and worked mostly by labourers on contract, reverted back to the huge,  Roman-style ‚Äúprotocapitalist‚Äù estates, called latifundias, owned by a small  √©lite and worked by serfs. Moriscos (forcibly baptised Muslims) were kept on to work in sugar production, and many Christian sugar mill managers  overlooked the fact that they secretly practised Islam, even begging the  King for their forgiveness.9  

 The capture of the Emirate of Granada in 1492 represented the end of  nearly 800 years of Christian efforts to (re)capture Muslim-ruled areas of  Iberia. For about the last 250 years of its existence, Al-Andalus had been confined to the Emirate of Granada. This kingdom was home to about a million people, roughly equivalent to the entire rest of Spain, many of them having migrated there to flee the Christian invasion (later rebranded as a  ‚ÄúReconquista‚Äù to construct the legitimacy of the takeover).10 

 During this time, Christian Spanish gentry, or hidalgos, had started to manage matters of local politics. Many enjoyed the privilege of tax exemption, but lacked land to extract a living from. Believing that their nobility forbade them from performing manual labour, they had no desire ‚Äì  or knowledge ‚Äì to perpetuate the Hispanomuslims‚Äô source of wealth:  agriculture.  

The Spanish Muslims‚Äô combined inheritance of Arab, Greek and Persian agronomy had turned the previously inhospitable mountain region around  Granada into gardens of plenty, and the city to which they paid tributes into a wealthy metropole supporting scholarship, arts and crafts, and  international trade.  

But a series of weak leaders, combined with heavy taxation as a vassal  state, and a 20-year siege by Isabella and Ferdinand‚Äôs combined Castilian and Aragonese forces, culminated in the fall of Granada, the last Muslim governed city in Europe, on the 2nd of January, 1492 CE.  

Enter Columbus

 Barely eight months later, on August 3rd of 1492, Christopher Columbus set sail, theoretically for India. We might well ask ourselves what all the  rush was about. Once Al-Andalus was conquered, the self-important ‚Äì but often poor ‚Äì hidalgos found themselves at a loss for lands to conquer and  plunder. So they turned their attentions elsewhere, initially to the idea of  abundant, exotic India, with its lucrative Asian trade networks. 

Columbus was aware of sugarcane production in the coastal plains of  Granada. He had visited the soon-to-be Catholic Kings of Spain,  Ferdinand and Isabella, at their royal encampment in Santa Fe, on the outskirts of the besieged city, to request their financial support for his quest. When he arrived in what is now part of the Bahamas, he noticed that the climatic conditions of these islands were not dissimilar to those along the coast of Granada.  

 At first, Columbus was blinded by the glitter of gold, which he noticed the native Ta√≠no people wore as jewellery, and forced them into mining it for him. However, these gold reserves ran out by the early 16th century,  and the arduous labour decimated the indigenous population, so he began  to focus on ‚Äúoro blanco‚Äù: white gold.  

 On his second voyage in 1493 CE, Columbus had taken along a Catalan named Miguel Ballester, who is recorded as the first white European to plant sugarcane in the West Indies and extract its juice, in 1505 CE.

 Initially, Columbus suggested transporting indigenous people from the lands he had captured to Granada to work on the existing sugarcane plantations there, but Isabella demurred. Not one to listen to a woman‚Äôs authority, Columbus kidnapped between 10 and 25 native people to present at the Spanish court, though only 8 survived the journey. Isabella ‚Äì  who apparently had much more compassion for Indigenous Americans than she did for Moors or Africans ‚Äì sent them back.  

However, after Isabella‚Äôs death in 1504, Ferdinand agreed to Columbus‚Äô  proposal. Hungry for labourers since the demise of the Ta√≠no, who were virtually exterminated by Spanish colonisation, Ferdinand sanctioned trafficking West African slaves en masse to work in the burgeoning Spanish  sugar industry.11 The Portuguese, British, French and Dutch clamoured to follow suit.12  

Christian Europe had actually earmarked African slaves to work in sugarcane plantations as far back as 1444 when Henry the Navigator,  cruising around West Africa in search of trade routes beyond Muslim control, found people he thought would be suited for the conditions of  sugarcane plantations. He trafficked 235 slaves from Lagos to Seville. 

Meanwhile, a debate was springing up among Spanish Catholics over the morality of having indigenous slaves in relation to their supposed degree of humanity. This was the birth of ‚Äúscientific racism‚Äù and a cornerstone in the evolution of white supremacy.  

Bartolom√© de las Casa, a 16th century Spanish landowner and later Dominican friar in Hispaniola, campaigned for an end to the cruel and  unjust enslavement of indigenous people on the encomiendas (land and serfs  given to Conquistadors by the Spanish Crown). At the Valladolid debate of  1550 CE, he challenged Juan Gin√©s de Sep√∫lveda‚Äôs argument that indigenous people were subhuman and required Spanish subjugation to  civilise them. However, in an attempt to protect indigenous people, de las  Casas initially suggested using Black and white slaves instead. 

The much-vaunted fertility of the so-called New World stoked the fires of the Spanish landed gentry‚Äôs greed, and the experience of growing sugar in  Spain was exported to these newly-captured territories. Sugar production is  therefore ‚Äúconsidered the world‚Äôs first capitalistic venture and it was  European aristocracy and merchants who happily stumped up the cash to get the cogs whirring.‚Äù13

 Over the next three centuries, at least 12 million slaves would be trafficked  from Africa to perform the back-breaking work of growing sugarcane, and the lethally dangerous work of turning it into sugar, supercharging these European economies and transforming the world as we know it.  

 Sugarcane plantations were also the cauldron where white supremacist notions were cooked up and crystallised into law. Here, not only did overseer morph into law enforcement officer, but white slavers whipped up fear of Black people who outnumbered them on plantations, sowing the seeds for the absurd Great Replacement conspiracy theory that stokes white extinction anxiety even today.14

Although there were a few European voices in favour of abolition, it was only when the sugar-slave complex ceased to be economically viable for the  British, as Eric Williams famously demonstrated in Capitalism and Slavery,  that the movement eventually succeeded. When slavery was officially abolished by British law in 1833 CE, the government borrowed ¬£20 million  to pay off the investors for the loss of their valuable ‚Äúpossessions‚Äù, in 1835.15  The debt was only paid off, by British taxpayers, in 2015.16

***

Sugar‚Äôs 9,000-year odyssey westwards charts episode after episode of  conquest and imperial expansion. It played a potent role in changes to farming and society, and fuelled the explosion of European imperialism,  mass enslavement of Africans, neoliberalism, and white supremacist ideas.  As the world‚Äôs first major monoculture, it also continues to wreak extensive damage to the environment.  

Whether we like it or not, Muslims have played a part in this story. The sugarcane plantations of Al-Andalus did use slave labor to supplement a free workforce, mainly saqaliba, Christian prisoners of war.  One of the very first African slaves captured by Europeans in 1441 CE was  an Arabic-speaking Sanhaja, who reputedly negotiated his release in exchange for helping the Portuguese acquire more African slaves.17 

 While the insatiable sugar-slave complex was undeniably a Western project, the participation of Muslims in the global slave trade is a stain on our conscience that needs to be cleansed.

The sugar trade is still plagued by problematic working conditions;18 nearly half of all sugar entering the UK is from areas  with documented forced and child labour.19 

 To add even more guilt to this guilty pleasure, sugar is a major offender  when it comes to the environment. Sugar plantations in Madeira, the  Canary Islands, and across the New World decimated virgin forests, leading to famine and irreparable damage to ecosystems. Contemporary  sugar plantations produce greenhouse gas emissions, overconsume water in  water-stressed areas, and pollute waterways with pesticides and fertilisers.  According to the World Wildlife Fund, ‚Äúsugar is ‚Äòresponsible for more  biodiversity loss than any other crop.‚Äô‚Äù20 

As troubling as it is to witness the catastrophes of human action, both past  and present, it‚Äôs essential for us to understand and acknowledge the role Muslims played to prevent the same crimes from being replicated. To reclaim the Muslim history of sugar is to claim a stake in its future, and the power to choose a more just path.

1hfgnlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenOver30/comments/1hfgnlo/modern_vs_traditional_is_there_no_halfway_point/,"Modern vs traditional , is there no halfway point ? ","My background :

I come from a pretty conservative middle eastern background.
In this culture you will find  most men work and support financially and women stay home or work a job for fun /leisure ( part time) if their spouse is progressive .

Usually marrying ‚Äúwell‚Äù means you‚Äôre taken care of and men don‚Äôt look to their partner for financial contributions whatsoever.

Unless the women  is super career driven and is making it known from the early courting stages she won‚Äôt give up her careeer,  it‚Äôs usually expected she won‚Äôt be needing to work.

Now the younger generation is more laid back with their wives not working but leave it up to her to decide.

At the end of the day they still don‚Äôt count on her income for much, maybe just for fun money for the women to have.

Growing up like this and seeing all the men in my family operate like this and then moving to North America was truly a culture shock and strange.

I noticed people asking each or give back 1 dollar for coffee or ask their kids for rent or couple split all expenses literally down the middle.

I am not judging them because it‚Äôs their culture but I don‚Äôt love it. 

It feels really stingy and calculated for me and I think for them it‚Äôs seen as very fair and equal. 

However I know North America is filled with various cultures ( immigrants ) and what I want in a relationship is not necessarily to stay home and just wash dishes or have babies. No hate to that.
I think I‚Äôd be bored.

I mean I work full time so I have no issue working just to keep myself occupied and stimulated and have money to spend. Or take a pay cut to work for causes I care about. 

Currently as a normal functioning ecuayed adult,I am independent and pay my own expenses.

 I wasn‚Äôt ever asked to contribute to my own education and give my parents rent . In fact I was lucky enough to have my father help me with my phone bill and car insurance and gas when I lived at home .

I don‚Äôt take for granted that I was taken care of my whole life untill I found a job and asked if it would be okay to move out.

 My family had no issues with it because they saw me being able to hold it into place. 

Fun fact ! I am actually the  first unmarried women in my whole family to live alone and it‚Äôs seen as a big deal because in my culture that‚Äôs very controversial! You don‚Äôt leave the parental house untill you are married .


I was lucky that I was also not restricted to do things like get an education or get married off early.

Now in a partner I‚Äôd want someone who wouldn‚Äôt care if I worked or not. That would be my personal ideal situation.

Like someone who would be happy either way because it doesn‚Äôt affect him at all what I do as long as I‚Äôm happy and fulfilled. Meaning he‚Äôs not really relying on me financially for things.

Is this possible in North America ? 
Does a man like this exist ?

It seems like North America is so polarized that you either 

1) become a stay at home mom who has lots of kids and is submissive to your husband because he is the sole breadwinner and he happily pays the bills, often this man is somewhat religious or conservative 
He is big on traditional and family oriented and sometimes  politically he has very rigid views 
He might not let you go out with your girlfriends 
He might not let you go on vacation with your sister or cousin without him
which are sometimes toxic and scary not always of course  but it can go there 

Or  

2) become a girl who has the roommate arrangement with her husband  who while working a full time job is still expected to be a mom full time and splits expenses  down the middle. Or in North America it‚Äôs called 50-50, she‚Äôs hyper independent often and he‚Äôs very liberal and progressive and doesn‚Äôt believe in taking care of his lady $ wise and wants her to contribute financially tends to leans more left politically and is usually atheist/agnostic and more into being free and wild and labels himself as a feminist to get brownie points with women .. 

I‚Äôm generalizing of course for the sake of this post
But I‚Äôve met either of these two archetypes mainly in my own life

Does it have to be one or the other ? 

Is there not a man who is okay with his women being independent and working but also supports her if she doesn‚Äôt want to work either ? 

I‚Äôm just saying if the only way to be with a full provider male to be a stay at home mom with a million kids ? 

Is there no man who doesn‚Äôt mind  takes care of things financially or being the breadwinner and also lets her work and do her own thing ? 

I‚Äôm genuinely wondering ? 

Is this seen as selfish because I wanna work and still be taken care of ?  

I‚Äôm okay with doing it all alone but if I‚Äôm with a man then why would I wanna go Dutch ? 

I know most men in my culture wouldn‚Äôt have an issue with it but could also use it to control me if they‚Äôre the type that has that mentality of ‚Äú since I‚Äôm providing , you‚Äôre at my mercy ‚Äú

But what if I go outside of my culture ? Do men of other culture only want to do the 50-50 type scenario ?

I know  some Americans also have this set up but it‚Äôs more rare compared compared to Middle East or Asia or Africa or Latin America 

I‚Äôm not looking for pure transactional sugar daddy type of sex for money. 
I am looking for a stable financially solid guy who doesn‚Äôt necessarily need to rely on my income and doesn‚Äôt then want to put my into a box and make me stay at home having babies all day .

1hfgnay,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1hfgnay/i_think_the_solution_to_getting_disciplined_is_to/,"I think the solution to getting disciplined is to live your life and try your best at it, in the present moment to moment ","The reason i think this is the soultion, is because i tend to play games a lot and i notice, i want to play to win, i dont just aim to enjoy or have fun with the game, having fun with the game is trying to win and trying to win my way. 

So i'm using that as like a sign that you need to try your best at anything you say you can do, and really think and consider how and then go about doing so. 

  
Now the reason I said the solution is to live your life ------but first, by that i mean, live your life in the sense, that you can go on a walk and have music playing in your headphones, thats not living your life, i mean it is, but im saying being okay without the music, and have no music at all playing when you do things. 

  
accept that life can be dull and boring and depressing, --------even tho i said, that, when i play games, i tend to quit or stop playing once i feel the game is dull, and i stop playing to win and just exist and save. 

  
the issue with real life, is you cant quit, it like you do can do with a game. 

i think for me, if i try to force myself to play a game i have no interest or care for, is close to the type or kind of feelings i have in real life when i hit a wall or feel no progress or wanting to quit or stop trying 

so with that said, you do simply have to get started despite how you feel and i think the way to logic, is not waiting for emotions to sway yout mind to think and then your body to act.

  
the other issue is i find myself seeking to sleep a lot, im not sure why that is, when i say ima quit playing games and dom scroling and get serious with things, i start to seek to sleep, probably because i lack sleep and dont sleep much but my point is i think being tired becomes my only distraction 

  
another way to describe by what i mean by live your life, is don't live vicariouslty and experiecne your story as it is, not what you feel it ought to be or should be, for instance, certain things i want to do with my life, like ask a girl out at work, i know the potential risk of doing so and there really is no way to avoid it exactly, i have embrace it head on, and thats what im saying 

anyway ima take a nap and then make sure to drink coffee when i wake up, and then try to make money online somehow and like try to enjoy or embrace the experience of all that will be expreicne as i aim to go about my goals today, and that the story i will be livng in and experiencing ",9,1734346752.0,getdisciplined,1,0.91,False

I‚Äôm homeschooled and because of that I spend almost all my days with her. Due to Insomnia issues/sleep issues I struggle with waking up to my alarms and keeping a consistent sleep schedule so my mom usually wakes me up in the morning for school. I log on and all usually ends up being fine but recently my mom has started saying things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre an asshole‚Äù and ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not nice‚Äù anything like that, referring to my behavior. This had me confused so I asked her what she was talking about and she told me that in the mornings I am; ‚ÄúA Monster‚Äù apparently when she tries to wake me up in any way that isn‚Äôt with coffee and hugs I go insane. She told me that I will sometimes sit up and scream at her to ‚ÄúGET THE FUCK OUT OF MY ROOM!!!‚Äù And ‚ÄúLEAVE ME ALONE‚Äù and honestly cuss her out. The thing is‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt remember any of the instances she told me about.

I explained that every time I‚Äôve gotten up I‚Äôve been quick to log on to my classes and be productive, but she told me that I must be awake for these interactions because we have had full conversations. I have always been prone to sleeping like a rock. There have been many instances where my family has had to check my pulse because they couldn‚Äôt tell if I was alive or not so it‚Äôs not like my sleeping habits have just began. The weird thing is, is that I‚Äôve never had arguments in my sleep before this. This last year I‚Äôve had a lot of unsolved medical issues going on so I‚Äôve been constantly changing my meds. Those meds have directly been messing up my sleep because I almost never have enough time to adjust. I feel like my meds could be responsible for these sleep mood swings but either way it makes me feel awful.

I never cuss out my mom. I barely even cuss around her, so to hear that in the mornings I will fully scream at her to leave me alone and basically cuss her out??  It‚Äôs strange and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm an asshole or if it‚Äôs just my sleep troubles that make me an asshole. Outside of these morning interactions our relationship is great, I just don‚Äôt know what to do to fix this and I don‚Äôt know what I can do to change this behavior.

I've had underlying issues for a couple years that have developed into addictions. I didn't even realized that they were festering but now I find myself with addictions stimulants, pornography, coffee, cigarettes and the internet. It's all used to distract and I inevitably isolate myself, which has impacted my ability to form personal connections. I think I've got some unresolved things with my family that haven't been address.

Recently over the course of the summer, I took an internship as a journalist in Uganda and then solo traveled through East Africa. It was eye opening and I would suggest it to any young man, despite a couple experiences I found myself in. Most significantly, after the internship I fell into an intense situation in rural Kenya that unfolded over the course of 4 days. I ran out of emergency USD, got into confrontations with locals which escalated, actually gave away my laptop at one point but then miraculously got it back. This happened at the very beginning of my trip. It's an incredible story. After I reentered Uganda, my parents begged me to stay in the country or fly home early. But I could not concede that this trip was a failure. I proceeded to move through Kenya and Ethiopia, exercising a high level of caution and experiencing some truly incredible things.

When I return, none of my three siblings were there to greet me. They were angry that I caused the strain on my parents. It sounds like the stress was significant. For example, my twin sister told me that one morning my dad woke up and told her that he had dreamt that I had died. That was hard to hear. I just wanted to reconnect with my siblings so I apologized to everyone, traveling a couple hours to see two of them. What I understood was that because of my decision to continue, I had forgone any sympathy from my family for what had happened to me.

Since September, I didn't even realize this but I've completely imploded. I had three PTSD events and then nothing. I went down to three classes, but my issues got drastically worse compared to previous semesters and now I expect to fail these classes. I got a prescription for stimulants and immediately started abusing them, even stealing my roommates medication a couple times without his consent. I've always had problems with porn and the internet but they've also gotten worse. Something that is also new is my sleep is so unstable. I pull all nights constantly, get little sleep days on end, and then my body completely crashes. It's impossible to function. Obviously my eating is terrible. Additionally, I've pick up smoking which is triggered whenever I feel anxious. This semester has been insane.

The crazy part is that I didn't even realize that this was happening. I didn't even recognize that I had these severe problems. It changed when I took mushrooms for the first time with a friend and had an emotional explosion. The positive I can take away from this is now I know, he knows, and he's offered his friendship. We've both agreed that I need professional help immediately.

I'm going back to live at home this semester. It's clear I've been avoiding the confrontation that needs to be had with these long term issues and what happened in Africa. The crazy part that I realized is that I haven't even talked about what had happened with anyone. I flaunt the story but I actually haven't revisited it. I'm looking for advice, guidance, and a story that is similar.

What I was wondering about is why the change?

Comparisons between the two -

OC in terms of decor is almost the same as Only Calories.
Some additions and subtractions on the wall and a partition in front of the washroom. Maybe a paint change I‚Äôm not sure. Same chairs and tables laid out differently.

OC in terms of menu is the biggest change.
They are changing the brand identity to be a more artisanal experience especially in terms of food presentation, quality and taste.

I tried one sandwich and coffee ( only those things I‚Äôll share why later ) 
And coffee wasn‚Äôt much better or worse than it was during only calories time but sandwich was different.
I don‚Äôt remember it being on the old menu but it was good. Fresh ingredients and good presentation and taste. 

Only calories had good food too, I used to like the saucy pasta they had. 

But there‚Äôs a problem this brand change has brought up and it was in pricing.

The sandwich I had was around 280 I think. There were expensive ones and also lower priced ones but I didn‚Äôt see any food items below 200 I think except for beverages. Majority of the menu was higher priced.

This is why I ordered only two things. I am not insanely rich so don‚Äôt have 1000s to spend at caf√©s for snacks. 

I typically spend around 100-200 in caf√©s 2-3 times a week and that‚Äôs my budget. 

What I was was wondering about is why the change? Are such artisanal caf√©s needed in our city? 

I personally liked only calories better and will not be going back here.

1hfgg4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/thrillerbooks/comments/1hfgg4b/the_illusion_of_love/,"""The Illusion of Love""","**Chapter 1: A Chance Encounter**

It was a typical rainy evening in London when Oliver Bennett, a 32-year-old finance professional, stepped into his favourite local pub,¬†**The Drunken Poet**. He had spent most of the day buried in spreadsheets and meetings, and now all he wanted was a quiet pint to end the week. The pub was warm, its dim lighting casting a golden glow on the old wooden beams. The chatter of regulars filled the air, and the comforting scent of hops and roasted nuts surrounded him.

As Oliver approached the bar, he noticed her‚Äî**Eliza Turner**. She was sitting alone at a corner table, sipping a glass of wine and flicking through a fashion magazine. Her dark, wavy hair framed her face perfectly, and her striking blue eyes were lost in the pages before her. She exuded a quiet confidence, an energy that felt effortlessly magnetic.

Oliver hadn‚Äôt planned on talking to anyone, but something about Eliza caught his attention. Maybe it was the way she laughed at something on her phone, or how effortlessly she seemed to belong in the world of fashion. He found himself walking over to her, almost without thinking.

""Mind if I join you?"" he asked with a friendly smile.

Eliza looked up, surprised for a moment, but then smiled back. ""Not at all,"" she said, making room for him at the table. ""I could use some company.""

They exchanged pleasantries, and Oliver quickly learned that Eliza was a 30-year-old fashion designer, working for a boutique firm that catered to high-end clients. She had recently moved to London from Brighton to chase her dreams in the fashion capital of the world. Oliver, on the other hand, worked in finance, a job that was stable but, he often admitted, not nearly as exciting as she made her world seem.

The conversation flowed easily between them. They talked about their careers, their favourite places in London, and the absurdity of dating apps. By the time Oliver finished his beer, he realized he had shared more with her than he usually did with anyone in a long time.

""Would you like to grab dinner sometime?"" he asked, unable to hide his smile. ""Maybe somewhere that's a little less... rainy?""

Eliza chuckled. ""I'd like that. Here‚Äôs my number.""

She handed him her phone with a wink, and Oliver saved her contact without thinking twice.

As he left the pub that night, Oliver felt a spark of something he hadn‚Äôt felt in a long time‚Äîexcitement.

**Chapter 2: Growing Together**

Over the next few weeks, Oliver and Eliza saw each other regularly. Their dates were filled with laughter, deep conversations, and long walks around the city. They both cherished the moments they spent together. Eliza loved how Oliver could be so serious and ambitious when it came to his career, while Oliver found Eliza‚Äôs creative world inspiring, her passion for fashion infectious.

They soon moved in together, finding a cozy flat in South London that was perfect for both their worlds. Oliver‚Äôs side of the apartment was filled with books, financial reports, and minimalist furniture. Eliza, on the other hand, added a splash of colour with her eclectic mix of vintage finds and fashion magazines. Together, they created a space that felt uniquely theirs.

Mornings were spent over coffee, each of them wrapped in their own routine but always together. Oliver would read through market reports while Eliza sketched new designs for her latest project. Some days, they would cook together, laughing over burnt toast or perfecting a new recipe they had found online.

""I‚Äôm not sure if we‚Äôre ever going to be able to afford a vacation,"" Oliver joked one day, his eyes focused on his laptop.

""We‚Äôll make it work,"" Eliza replied, pouring him another cup of coffee. ""You can‚Äôt put a price on experiences. Let‚Äôs go to Spain!""

And so, they did. A few months later, they found themselves in the sunny streets of Barcelona, savouring tapas and walking hand-in-hand through the vibrant markets. The trip was the first of many‚Äîsoon, they ventured to Paris, then Egypt, and later to the Bahamas. Each trip was an adventure, a reminder of how much they loved exploring the world together.

**Chapter 3: A Test of Love**

As the years passed, their love continued to grow. They supported each other through career challenges‚ÄîOliver‚Äôs demanding job in finance often led to late nights and stressful moments, but Eliza was always there with a comforting word, a warm meal, or a spontaneous trip to the park to clear his mind. Likewise, Oliver stood by Eliza during the highs and lows of her fashion career, encouraging her when she doubted her talent and celebrating every milestone along the way.

But like all relationships, theirs had its share of challenges. A miscommunication here, a late night at the office there, and soon, they found themselves fighting. Their arguments were often about small things‚Äîwho forgot to take out the trash or why Eliza had spent too much on a new dress‚Äîbut sometimes, those small things snowballed into larger issues. They‚Äôd argue, sometimes in tears, but they always came back to each other, apologizing and remembering what they shared.

Yet, one day, things felt different.

**Chapter 4: The Breakup**

It was a Friday evening when the fight started. Oliver was exhausted from a week of long hours, and Eliza was frustrated with the demands of her upcoming fashion show. Their communication broke down completely, and harsh words were exchanged.

""Maybe we need a break,"" Eliza said quietly, her voice trembling. Oliver‚Äôs heart sank. ""A break? You‚Äôre serious?""  
""Yes,"" she whispered. ""I think we need time apart.""

For the first time in five years, they didn‚Äôt talk for two months. The flat they had shared now felt like an empty shell, and every corner reminded Oliver of her absence.

The days were long, and the loneliness was overwhelming. He missed her laughter, her creativity, and the warmth she brought to every room she entered. He missed the way she made him feel like he was more than just a finance guy, the way she inspired him to chase dreams beyond spreadsheets and numbers.

But Eliza felt the same. She missed Oliver‚Äôs steady presence, his calm demeanour, and the way he always supported her. Two months passed, and neither of them reached out, but their hearts ached in the silence.

**Chapter 5: Reunion**

Finally, it was Oliver who broke the silence. He stood outside her favourite cafeÃÅ, his heart racing as he texted her. ‚ÄúI miss you. Can we talk?‚Äù

A minute later, her response came: ‚ÄúI miss you too. I‚Äôve been thinking about us.‚Äù

They met, cautiously at first, unsure of where things stood. But as they talked, their love became clear again. They had made it through the hardest period of their relationship, and they knew they wanted to be together.

""I promise,"" Oliver said, holding her hands, ""I will never leave you again.""

""Neither will I,"" Eliza whispered, tears welling in her eyes. ""We‚Äôre stronger than this.""

**Chapter 6: The Illusion**

For the next five years, they built a beautiful life together. They chose furniture and house decorations, picking out every detail with care. They continued to travel, enjoying each other‚Äôs company in new places, and their love deepened every day. They were each other's everything.

But one morning, everything changed.

Oliver woke up alone in their bed. The sun was rising, casting a soft glow over the room, but there was no sign of Eliza. He called out her name, but there was no answer. Panic began to rise in his chest as he searched the apartment, but she was nowhere to be found.

Confused, he wandered through the city, visiting their favourite spots‚ÄîThe Drunken Poet, the park, the cafeÃÅ where they had reunited‚Äîbut there was no trace of her.

That night, he sat in their flat, staring at the empty space where she had once been. The furniture, the pictures on the walls, the little notes they had left for each other‚Äîthey all seemed so real, yet now they felt like an illusion.

He scoured social media, searching for any trace of her, but nothing. No record. No mention.

**Eliza Turner**¬†didn‚Äôt exist.

The woman he had loved, travelled with, and spent his life building a future with was never born. His memories were just that‚Äîmemories of someone who was never there. And now, for the first time in five years, Oliver truly understood the emptiness that had always been within him.

He had never been with Eliza. He had been alone all along.

And so, he sat, in the silence of the empty apartment, the weight of his years without her settling over him, realizing that the love of his life had only ever existed in his mind.

And perhaps, that was the greatest illusion of all.",1,1734345875.0,thrillerbooks,0,1.0,False

1hfgdqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1hfgdqr/addiction_africa_and_advice/,"Addiction, Africa, and Advice","21(M) undergrad and I've been struggling. I've had underlying issues for a couple years that have developed into addictions. I didn't even realized that they were festering but now I find myself with addictions stimulants, pornography, coffee, cigarettes and the internet. It's all used to distract and I inevitably isolate myself, which has impacted my ability to form personal connections. I think I've got some unresolved things with my family that haven't been address.

Recently over the course of the summer, I took an internship as a journalist in Uganda and then solo traveled through East Africa. It was eye opening and I would suggest it to any young man, despite a couple experiences I found myself in. Most significantly, after the internship I fell into an intense situation in rural Kenya that unfolded over the course of 4 days. I ran out of emergency USD, got into confrontations with locals which escalated, actually gave away my laptop at one point but then miraculously got it back. This happened at the very beginning of my trip. It's an incredible story. After I reentered Uganda, my parents begged me to stay in the country or fly home early. But I could not concede that this trip was a failure. I proceeded to move through Kenya and Ethiopia, exercising a high level of caution and experiencing some truly incredible things.

When I return, none of my three siblings were there to greet me. They were angry that I caused the strain on my parents. It sounds like the stress was significant. For example, my twin sister told me that one morning my dad woke up and told her that he had dreamt that I had died. That was hard to hear. I just wanted to reconnect with my siblings so I apologized to everyone, traveling a couple hours to see two of them. What I understood was that because of my decision to continue, I had forgone any sympathy from my family for what had happened to me.

Since September, I didn't even realize this but I've completely imploded. I had three PTSD events and then nothing. I went down to three classes, but my issues got drastically worse compared to previous semesters and now I expect to fail these classes. I got a prescription for stimulants and immediately started abusing them, even stealing my roommates medication a couple times without his consent. I've always had problems with porn and the internet but they've also gotten worse. Something that is also new is my sleep is so unstable. I pull all nights constantly, get little sleep days on end, and then my body completely crashes. It's impossible to function. Obviously my eating is terrible. Additionally, I've pick up smoking which is triggered whenever I feel anxious. This semester has been insane.

The crazy part is that I didn't even realize that this was happening. I didn't even recognize that I had these severe problems. It changed when I took mushrooms for the first time with a friend and had an emotional explosion. The positive I can take away from this is now I know, he knows, and he's offered his friendship. We've both agreed that I need professional help immediately.

I'm going back to live at home this semester. It's clear I've been avoiding the confrontation that needs to be had with these long term issues and what happened in Africa. The crazy part that I realized is that I haven't even talked about what had happened with anyone. I flaunt the story but I actually haven't revisited it. I'm looking for advice, guidance, and a story that is similar. The tough part is that I can't related to anyone because which 21 year old Canadian's get traumatized in Africa these days.",1,1734345588.0,AskMenAdvice,1,1.0,False

On the second page he said this..Personally: IM SO SORRY Y/N .IM SO SORRY I CAUSED THIS TO HAPPEN IM SO SORRY FOR WHAT I DID IM SO SORRY FOR WHAT IVE DONE TO YOU. and I'm so sorry that i left you! No..NO I DONT want YOU TO GO..I don't want you and anybody to begone!!! ..I just don't know if I can save you  anymore..I DONT KNOW anymore..I just..i-i  don't wanna died just because of him..I couldn't live..I..

1hfgai8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1hfgai8/3_weeks_today/,3 weeks today,"I (father of toddlers) am not the best at writing thoughts down so bear with me here, but do feel like I need to share these wins as it‚Äôs important to me.

Like the title says, I‚Äôm 21 days alcohol free.  This is the longest I have been sober since a dry January in 2018.  Have had a handful of 14-19 day stints of sobriety since then but always caved and went straight back to my regular drinking habits (1.5L of vodka every 3-4 days).

This time feels incredibly different.  I consciously noticed I was making my vodkas stronger and stronger, so 1 can of seltzer would last me 3-4 drinks as a mixer vs 1 or 2 drinks.

While still early on, I am having 1 or 2 Heineken or Stella 0.0 on the weekend days‚Ä¶but here is what I have noticed:

Sleep - I have always been an early riser, but my sleep has been incredible.  Read a bedtime book, and roll over myself.  7-7.5 hours of amazing restful sleep, with at least an hour of peace and quiet in the morning with this sub and my coffee before the house wakes up.

Diet - again, early on but following an 80/20 rule.  Commit to 3 full meals, 2 healthy snacks in between, and of course treat myself to a scoop of ice cream or some chocolate covered blueberries at night

Activity - have always been active but would work out intensely just to burn calories to make room for alcohol calories.  I am now working out 5-6 days a week (think HIIT/Cross Training) with some active recovery on off days.  My aches and pains seem to be waning and I believe it‚Äôs due to the inflammation alcohol was causing me.

Attitude - I am so much calmer and less irritable.  Most of us know the chaos that comes with adulting/parenting (at times) and I am just rolling with it.  I am cherishing seeing life through my kids eyes, and am so much more present with everyone.  THIS is the greatest gift I can to my family.

There are so many more benefits, but just wanted to list a few from my own perspective.

In the months leading up to this, I knew deep down I WANTED to quit, but had such a hard time doing so.    I was as the saying goes ‚Äòsick and tired of feeling sick and tired‚Äô.  I truly feel I needed that inner battle with myself and put in that exhausting thought process to really hit the point of this cannot go on any longer.  I am not overly religious but do believe by something greater than me it was my time to quit, and I‚Äôm so happy it has finally come.  I saw my slippery slope getting more and more slippery, and I‚Äôm so happy with where I am at now.

I‚Äôve been a lurker for quite some time and will probably continue to be just that (maybe not!), but I just want to extend a huge thank you to everyone in this sub for posting as each and every single one helps me in some way.

Looking forward to a peaceful and slightly chaotic but sober Christmas/Holiday season and I hope you do the same.

Need help to sort it out","TLDR : my LO is my best friend, my roomate and coparent to my kids. We really are in love but he didn't move over his ex (I even suspect he's also limerent about her) and just struggle to get out of depression. The doubt, lack of commitment is killing me and I don't see any way out except taking what he can offer without hopinfg for more. No contact and him moving out is still too hard to do because it'll destroy everything WE are trying to build.



I just discovered I'm living a LE, for the first time of my life. I was thinking I was loosing my mind before finding out I'm not alone in this. It's been 18 month (maybe more cause I fell for him quite before but it was more a traditionnal infatuation back then).

I've made the worst mistake of my life, when he got dumped by his ex GF and asked me if I could rent him a spare room, I've said yes... It was 18 month ago. 

He's not over his ex, currently depressed as fuck and struggle to get better. In a nutshell let's say he's emotionnally unavailable. He do loves me but don't make any moves toward a commited relationship with me for various reasons. But what I see, and everyone around us see it to, is that we are living together, loving each other, raising my kids like a couple.

Let use HIS words here ""I love you, I'm in love with you, you're my best friend, my sexual soulmate and we are building something here but not the kind of commited relationship you need. We might never be a couple like you wish"".

For my part, I'm deep deep into limerence now. All I can do is think how I could fix this, what we will become. I'm aware of his flaws, I'm not delusional, right now he's a mess and I don't want to be with him like this.

Lately, I've stopped feeding the beast inside me, saying to myself it's over, that I need to move on, I spend all my nights and mornings preparing mentally to ask him move out my life. But then he'll come up the stairs for our coffee, laughing together, smiling at each other, and my mind goes wild.

He's very commited in that roomate stuff, he's commited toward my kids too, there is a real attachment going on beetween him and my youngest. And he's still trying his best to move over his ex and working to get out of depression. He says I'm VITAL to him and I'm the only reason he gets up every morning. I don't want to destroy that.

So I'm here wishing the LE will just fade eventually. I've stopped using loving emojis when we text, I've stop responding or initating goodnight texts (even though it was making me so happy). We stopped having sex, I've stopped touching him (but he still hug and kiss me goodnight from time to time). He says he need alone time but when isolated in his room, we'll play online games together... He's omnipresent in my life, dependant on me for his grocery, car ride, I've even helped him build a workshop in my garage for his art. When he goes out alone, he comes home and reassure me by telling my his life outside home in great details.

But I have to admit, the limerent part of me is still clinging to the fact that moving away from him will give him the final wake up call to finally commit.

  
Because in the end I'm 100% SURE once commited I'll stop being so obsessed. Uncertainty doubt is making me like that, that's not ME. I've been in relationships before and I was stable. And I also do think we could be a healthy couple, I'm not delusional about this or foolling myself. In the high of our rollecoaster relationship, my needs were met and I was finally calming down, but then he got afraid...

Right now, my life is hell, I'm seing a therapist for self esteem issues and she threatened to kick me out if I didn't eventually force him to move out my life and go no contact because I'm too obsessed (ni shit sherlock). My friend are sick or hearing me going on and on about it, they tell me ""stop tormenting yourself and just be patient, we all know he'll commit but he really need the time"".

On the bright end, I'm self imporving as fuck, stopped smoking, becoming my best self, having a huge social life, working a lot on my hobbies, taking good care of my kids. But inside, I'm emotionnaly drained by the place he's taking.

this past week we‚Äôve had a new member of staff (m26) join us, he was hired to be our new grill chef so obviously works on a separate station to me. on the surface level he seemed really nice and super eager to get stuck into the work which is always amazing to see when taking on a new member of staff.

as a supervisor i (f20) was super friendly and welcoming, helping to orient him with the cafe and how we do things. offered him coffee, food when he was going on his break etc, just trying to provide good hospitality to a new member of staff so he felt comfortable in his new work place, as i know starting a new job can sometimes be a bit intimidating or stressful.

for some context, i run a dedicated instagram page for coffee as the head barista and post a lot of stuff on there that gets reposted onto the business‚Äô main account, so he followed that account a few weeks ago and sent me a message saying how he was super excited to start the job and how amazing my coffee looks. i didn‚Äôt read into it at all and just thought he seemed to be a good egg.

anyways - after his initial shift on thursday he sent me a message to thank me for being so welcoming etc and i replied to say it was no big deal and i was just doing my job as his supervisor and coworker. then he kept replying but this time the messages turned a bit flirty. it made me feel quite uncomfortable and as if my nice demeanour had been taken entirely the wrong way. i left his message on read as i really didnt know what to do, but i did screenshot the text - he later edited the message to come across as less forward.

i spoke to my mum about the whole ordeal seeking advice on what to do as she runs her own cafe (i do not work there). she told me that i shouldn‚Äôt tell my boss about it but to just keep an eye on the situation to see if he tried to speak to me like that again. i agreed as i didnt want to make a big scene of the whole thing, especially as he‚Äôs such a new member of staff.

sunday rolls around and our boss isnt in the building on this particular day so my coworker (f23) is the stand in manager and i am obviously still on supervisor duty. new guy sort of caused a few minor issues throughout the day (mostly just bossing my coworkers around) so i mentioned to the manager what he had said previously in the week and how uncomfortable it made me feel, and how it made me reluctant to be so friendly and welcoming to him again. i then discover from our stand in manager that he is ENGAGED TO (one of) OUR BOSS‚Äô DAUGHTER???? holy shit i feel like i have opened a can of worms and i‚Äôm at a loss on whether to tell my boss or not (our cafe is currently co-owned by three people, one is in charge of staff affairs and complaints, one in charge of all the baking stuff, hiring new staff - and this is the guy who‚Äôs daughter is in a relationship with new member of staff, and another boss who oversees all ordering and financial stuff)

sunday manager told me that she thinks i should quietly mention the situation to our boss that deals with staff issues just so that they know about it but i really dont want to be a difficult coworker ://

i really dont know how to proceed with this situation. new guy really hasn‚Äôt done anything explicitly wrong to me but the messages just seem inappropriate in a professional sense and it made me feel uncomfortable and disrespected in a way. now that i know that he is engaged romantically with our boss‚Äô daughter i feel as if telling our boss will create a messy situation as there is a bit of a conflict of interest going on. i just want to maintain a professional relationship with all of my coworkers.
