When you're bing lazy and don't make your research on advance you pay with wasted expensive coffee beans. The AI recommended to start from 15 to 20 clicks with the K6 grinder. Both settings chocked the picospresso and no coffee came out. The grinder in its manual says 40 clicks is for espresso. 20 for Turkish coffee. Does anyone know the correct grinding size, ideally with the K6 grinder, so for a poor fella like me to not waste an unreasonable amount of time and coffee beans? Thanks on advance.

9th : we arrived in siem reap by a tuktuk, and put our stuffs and stayed in onederz, the private wing. Then we went to buy a ticket for my dad for the temples and in the meanwhile that pouch is still with me because I take it out to get some stickers for the tuk tuk. We wander around Angkor wat, Angkor toch for a while. Then drove another tuktuk to Angkor thom and other temples, Bayon temple, ta keo temple, bakheng, basically vong toch. When we‚Äôre done, we went to a local small restaurant nearby that has a hammock and rest there. Later on we went to the night market and pub street, stopped by to massage at the place at the center of the pub street nearby the phsar Khmer food court. Then we went back to our room and rest. At this point, the pouch is still with me.

10th : me and my mom woke up and went to buy kuy teav to eat in the morning and came back to our room. We went to check in again for another day. Then at the afternoon, me and my parents went to eat at an Indian restaurant then we continue to go tonle sap and kampong phluk, the floating village by a boat. And just drove by the temples and get into a few small ones. we also went to preah ang chek preah ang chorn shrine to pray, then we stopped to eat at a Korean restaurant called ‚Äúkimchi‚Äù and we went to the same massage store like yesterday, rest in the room. I feel like I might‚Äôve lost it this day. I feel too exhausted to check anything at all and just sleep.

11th, the last day : on the morning we prepared to check out, take our luggage out at the reception. And sat down for a coffee at onederz. Today we went to wear a Khmer traditional dress to the Angkor thom gate and then Angkor Wat, I will show you through the pic what I look like. At that time I‚Äôm not sure if I bring it with me or not. After Angkor wat, we went to Neak Poan temple, prayed and we went by a tuktuk, walk around the pub street, ate gelato mono, and then Khmer hot pot in a restaurant at the pub street. My mom did asked me beforehand if I had forgotten anything, but I said no and continue on, big mistake on my part. We walked around for a while again and stopped at a massage place inside the pub street.

While the technical content and networking could have been valuable, the logistics are a total disaster. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on:

Food and Refreshments

1. The meals are extremely limited with very few choices. It feels like cost-cutting on participant meals.

2. Only one viand served at lunch because the buffet is not enough to cater everyone, no snacks or refreshments during breaks despite long sessions.

3. Food stations are assigned far from the tables, forcing people to cross the hall and causing congestion.

4. Only one coffee station for a venue of this size, which means long lines and missed breaks.

Venue and Program Management

5. Insufficient projectors and screens, so people at the back can‚Äôt see the presentations clearly.

6. No instructions on what to do during parallel sessions. The sound from the main hall overlaps with the ongoing sessions. After the sessions, there‚Äôs no guidance either, so attendees are just left confused.

7. No ushers to guide participants and no officers at the registration desk to handle questions.

Official Receipt (OR)

8. Long queues for the OR even though participant details were pre-collected.

9. ORs are still unavailable, third-party contractors can‚Äôt answer basic questions, and no one can assure us when we‚Äôll get them.

It was late Friday after scrubbing a Whipple, and ngl I was wrecked. Longest week of the block and I just wanted to feel like a human again, so I drove to Dutch Bros right before closing.

I roll up in wrinkled scrubs, still smelling like chlorhexidine, and the barista‚Äôs this tattooed redhead who teases me about being a nurse. I laugh, drop my phone, crack the screen - tbh I was more nervous than I should‚Äôve been. Not exactly the kind of girl you meet on call. Somehow I still asked, ‚Äúhey, you look overworked, wanna grab a drink nearby?‚Äù She actually said yes. Ended up in some sketchy IPA-smelling bar, we made out, and she left my place just before her shift. Met up a few more times, but she was too young for me long-term, so I moved on.

The funny part? That random night got me digging into Dutch Bros as a company. I‚Äôm not a value investor, more ‚Äúchase the narrative‚Äù - but their expansion outside Oregon looked legit.

Posting because I know there are others trying to manage this condition while working jobs that require you to be ""on"" all day. It's possible, but it nearly broke me first.

Started during my second year teaching - combination of stress, irregular eating (grabbing lunch whenever possible), and holding it all day because you can't just leave 25 third-graders alone. That first tear happened after a particularly difficult week of parent conferences when I was living on coffee and stress.

The pain was unlike anything I'd experienced. Every morning I'd wake up dreading not just the bathroom but the entire day ahead. Standing for 6+ hours teaching became torture. I couldn't sit at my desk during planning periods because it was too painful, so I'd lean against the wall trying to look casual while internally screaming.

The worst part was having to act normal around kids. Eight-year-olds are incredibly perceptive - they'd ask why I was walking funny or why I kept shifting positions. I became an expert at hiding grimaces behind smiles and finding excuses to step out briefly when spasms hit.

Bathroom breaks were my biggest fear. Our school has a strict policy about leaving classrooms unattended, so I'd hold it for hours, making everything worse. When I finally could go, the pain would leave me shaking and sweating. More than once, I had to compose myself in a bathroom stall before returning to teach.

Parent-teacher conferences were nightmares. Sitting in those tiny plastic chairs for hours discussing student progress while fighting waves of pain. I'd schedule them closer together than recommended because I couldn't handle prolonged sitting. Parents probably thought I was rushing them out.

I tried everything conservative for 8 months - sitz baths at 5 AM before work, carrying cushions everywhere, and eating carefully to avoid constipation. Some days were manageable; others I'd consider calling in sick. Used all my sick days and felt guilty about potentially exposing kids to germs when I wasn't really contagious.

The breaking point came during state testing week. Proctoring exams meant sitting still for hours - absolutely impossible with an active fissure. I made it through day one, then spent the evening crying because I knew I had four more days ahead and couldn't abandon my students during such an important time.

Finally got the minor procedure done over spring break. Recovery lined up perfectly with time off, and I returned for the final quarter completely pain-free. The difference in my teaching energy and patience with students was remarkable. I hadn't realized how much the constant pain was affecting my job performance.

Been symptom-free for over a year now. Can sit through faculty meetings, handle parent conferences without distraction, and actually enjoy teaching again. The procedure was so much easier than months of daily suffering.

To any teachers or professionals dealing with this - don't try to tough it out indefinitely like I did. Your job performance and mental health will suffer. The understanding team at Healing Hands Clinic worked around my school schedule and got me back to being the teacher my students deserved.

1newzh5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1newzh5,My First Ever Boots,"Brand - BLKBRD  
Model - Bulwark  
Last - Harley  
Outsole - Commando Lug Sole  
Size - 42.5 EU  

### Customization
1. Leather upper changed from ""Cognac"" to ""Thick Coffee."" The leather is supposedly 3 mm thick.  
2. Added a leather midsole.  

Original Price: $180  
After leather upgrade: $270 (excluding discount)  

### Experience
This is my first pair of boots, coming from only wearing sneakers before. The adjustment has been tough. I get pain in my shins when I lace them fully, but leaving the top speed hook unlaced helps. The tongue is very thick and stiff, and it‚Äôs gusseted up to the 4th eyelet. Otherwise, the fit feels perfect, no heel slip when laced all the way.  

The boots feel quite heavy to me, with the pair weighing around 2 kg.  

I kind of wish I had stuck with the original leather. The upgrade does look nicer, but the extra thickness is definitely going to make the break-in process more painful. That said, I was impressed that there‚Äôs no loose grain and the upper looks very consistent overall.  

I applied Leather Honey to help with the break-in, using almost 1/5 of an 8 oz bottle.  

### Conclusion
Overall, I really like these boots, but I don‚Äôt have any benchmark to compare them with yet. Once the Bulwarks are fully broken in, I plan to buy their Dixon model as well.

*‚ÄúGreetings Moscow, I am writing this from Kadykchan for Operation Gagarin. So far me and my team have made some interesting discoveries. In our attempt to figure faster space travel we decided to look at an older theory. Wormholes. We first attempted to create a doorway, it would bend space itself, creating a gateway for us to walk through! We created two doorways. And connected it with a vast amount of energy attempting to connect the two. Bend space around it. Out of 37 tests‚Ä¶ not one has been successful. We tried everything different. But no matter we failed. We are sorry to give you this report‚Äù*

This door was‚Ä¶ really old to say the least‚Ä¶ all it had was this [symbol](https://youtu.be/O_lufl9psAg?si=QF816itvgEScSfDu) and an old door knob. But‚Ä¶ it worked! It opened to something! I opened the door‚Ä¶ and ugh‚Ä¶ I saw it. It stinks, probably because the carpets all moldy, old and wet. I got a sample from the carpet. A mice drank it. It developed a yellow fungus. Before the mice died it acted strange, it was protective but..l it tried to bash its head against the wall several times. I found it dead bleeding against the wall with the fungus in its stomach. And then those hallways. Ugh‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs maddening. It‚Äôs all just the same color. Yellow, yellow and even more yellow. All of it was the same, the carpet, the walls, the ceilings, and those dang lights. Don‚Äôt even start with that‚Ä¶ is like a billion bees buzzing and ringing right on your ear drums. I was able to get some estimates of how big this space was. I calculated it‚Äôd be around 600 square miles of randomly segmented rooms. Thats over 3 times the size of earth.

Cigar: Villiger La Capitana
Humidor Time: 12-18 months

After the early morning errands, the week started with a coffee and the La Capitana. I was greeted with an oily Habano wrapper with an impressive band artwork, apparently depicting a female captain bravely controlling a distressed ship at sea. This cigar is no longer available, having been changed considerably in the last year to a completely new blend with new artwork.

The first third was simple, but not unpleasant. Predominantly soft woody tones with the occasional drop of sweetness.
The second and third acts followed the simple theme, with a shift from sweetness to a gentle salt and pepper.

I finished the cigar without any reason to be disappointed - neither for what it offered, nor that it has been discontinued.

An uncomplicated but not unpleasant experience - hope for the week ahead, knowing the peak certainly hasn‚Äôt been reached. On to Tuesday‚Ä¶

Honestly everyone saying that when you truly are over your ex they come back into your life some way or another. It's true. You can search my posts for the entire story but the tl;dr is that my ex blindsided me and instead of repairing things she decided to go into an another relationship. 

I finally accepted it when I heard that she has a new relationship and stopped contacting her.  Some mutual friends told me he is a literal downgrade. He even messaged me saying that he's thankful that I fumbled her and she looks better with him anyway. I just blocked him. It was not worth it. 

Fast forward 6 months later and a mutual friend kept telling me she keeps asking about me stuff and if I was down for us 3 to go out for a coffee because he saw that they don't follow eachother anymore on Instagram. She accepted it in an instant but I had my doubts  I was really not in the mood, I told my friend that I don't believe she is serious about it and I don't want to risk getting hurt again. He told me she would go out with her first to check her out.

I was thinking maybe I should go back with her, maybe she learnt her lesson, improved. Like every happy ending stories. It couldn't been further from the truth. It seemed she didn't changed at all. A part of me still cared about her but another part screamed that it's not worth it and I felt it in my bones it was a trap.

My friend went out with her at a coffee shop. Turns out the new guy is a drug addict, he convinced her doing drugs with him and her words ""he would call me at his place just for sex"". The most fcked up thing about it is the guy broke up with her because ""he is a bad influence to her"" but she suffers and wants him back BADLY. At that point my friend asked ""what's your intention with -my name-"". She couldn't care less about me. She just wanted to go out because she is alone and is suffering and has no one else to talk to. She said ""meh, he is too small for me""( she is 1cm taller than me and fat, while I am skinny). She has no job, no future and she is still caught up in this with the new guy being blind to the huge elephant in the room. She is almost 30, she worked 1 year her entire life. That was a huge problem for me in our relationship - her lack of ambition. I always tried to motivate her, help her get a career. I gave her unconditional love, I was there for her day and night. It seemed it never mattered,  it actually made things worse. She told my friend she doesn't want to fix anything with ANY exes, but only with this new guy. It seems like she completly lost it.

When I last talked to her I wished that she finds someone that would treat her exactly how she treated me, nothing more, nothing less. She told my friend that my ""curse"" has caught up to her. Honestly I never wished for her to end up THIS bad. I just wanted for her to learn a lesson from all this. But honestly looks like she didn't learn anything and it's time for me to truly move on. 

Anyway , I wanted to thank every one of you for your insights, your stories. They truly helped me get through my rough days, knowing that I am not alone in this world. I truly hope that everyone finds happiness and a partner that it's truly good for them. But it's time for me to leave this community because at this point I don't want to hear anything about relationships anymore. I feel it doesn't help me anymore and a part of me kinda moved on.

* My program basically made me caffeine-dependent ‚òï.
* Food is my weakness , I love exploring good eats and I don‚Äôt really feel guilty about spending for food (still within budget of course).

Personality-wise:

* In a generation obsessed with the ‚Äúmysterious, nonchalant guy,‚Äù I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm the opposite. I am very *non-nonchalant*.
* I‚Äôm not a fan of small talk. Most of the time I‚Äôm actually super talkative, so let‚Äôs skip the kumain ka na ba? chat and go straight to things that actually interest us.

**About You:**

* Around 21‚Äì26 (negotiable).
* Can keep up with my energy pero you don‚Äôt have to be extroverted, just not the type who gets annoyed easily when someone is really really social.
* Goal-oriented, you don't really have to figure everything out. Believe me, ako rin medyo lost pa, pero gusto ko lang naman is yung person na working towards a better future. Someone who believes na everything will eventually work out.
* A little spontaneous yung willing to say yes to new food spots, random plans, or just going with the flow.

As I write this post, I‚Äôve been trying for almost 2 hours to get him to sleep, because all his needs are met, yet every 2 minutes he starts crying. I give him a pacifier, which he spits out every second, and the cycle repeats.

I don‚Äôt enjoy this. It‚Äôs boring. I sit with him, always waiting for him to fall asleep so I can finally do¬†anything¬†‚Äî even something meaningless like drinking coffee and scrolling Instagram or shopping online.

Since he was born, my husband has taken care of him most of the time, because I had some physical health issues and my husband wanted me to recover. Unfortunately, he‚Äôs already back at work, and I‚Äôm devastated that I‚Äôll have to be the one taking care of the baby most of the time.

I don‚Äôt feel any joy in it ‚Äî only obligation.

I know people often advise going for a walk or doing something for yourself. But the problem is, so far my husband has given me that space ‚Äî I‚Äôve gone for walks or shopping to rest ‚Äî yet I was afraid to come back home, thinking he might not be asleep.

I‚Äôve read many posts saying it gets better, to wait for the first smile, etc. But I‚Äôm starting to doubt more and more that anything will change. I just keep searching for information about when it will get better. But what if this just isn‚Äôt for me?!

Hey everyone! I gotta say, I'm just absolutely BUZZING about the current state of no code automation. It feels like we‚Äôre at the start of some glorious new era where, seriously, *anyone* can turn wild ideas into working workflows‚Äîwithout ever having to write a single line of code. Isn‚Äôt that bonkers?

I‚Äôm seeing friends, coworkers, and even random online strangers connecting apps they use daily with just a bit of drag-and-drop magic. The process is no longer shrouded in mystery or reserved for developers‚Äîno code platforms like Zapier, Make, (and even GPTs now!) are totally democratizing automation.

What gets me most excited? The sheer creativity and empowerment:

- Small business owner automates appointment scheduling and client follow-ups in an afternoon.  
- Freelancers build custom lead generation assemblies, instantly plugging into email and CRM.  
- Teachers auto-organize class assignments, reminders, and feedback loops across multiple apps.  
- Literally anyone batch-resizes images, transcribes audio, or posts scheduled content‚Äîall while sipping coffee!

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs SO cool: if you can think in steps (If X happens, then do Y, or whenever Z, trigger Q), you‚Äôre 90% of the way there. The platforms are getting more visual, smart, and (dare I say?) fun. It feels like a game. 

Let‚Äôs pinch ourselves! Just a few years ago, you‚Äôd need to:

- Pitch your automation vision to IT and wait weeks hoping someone has time.
- Get quotes from overbooked software devs and try to translate your needs.
- OR‚Ä¶sigh‚Ä¶just give up and do it the hard way, again and again.

Now? You open a dashboard, connect your favorite apps, set logic in a few clicks, and marvel as the robots fly into action.

What are you automating these days?  
What clunky processes have you streamlined with NO CODE glory?  
Any favorite tools/tips/bizarrely satisfying ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moments?

Let‚Äôs trade stories! I think sharing these tiny victories (or hilarious fails) gets everyone inspired‚Äîbecause every single simple automation is a huge leap for human happiness. ü•≥

If you‚Äôve been watching from the sidelines, this is your happy little nudge: don‚Äôt overthink it‚Äîdive in, tinker, and watch your digital world reshape itself. The robots are ready to lift our boring burdens, and it feels like Christmas every time that ‚Äúzap‚Äù or ‚Äúscenario‚Äù or ‚Äúflow‚Äù just‚Ä¶ works.

It's true. I am attempting to make a meet up out of my weekend ritual. Like any wild idea it came without saying hello and in the dead of the night.

One of my weekend pleasures is to try new pastries either from my favorite shops or new ones. A good cuppa to go with it, bliss. We all have our cravings and our moments of questionable dietary decisions. So instead of braving them solo, have a party to back you up, like an RPG. Plus its nice to have a convo on the queue instead of doomscrolling ourselves to brainrot.

Why alpha testing? Because just like an alpha in a video game, I want to make it in a controlled environment with a debug friendly kernel. 

Joking aside, I figured that in order to test interest on this, I want to figure out how many folks will turn up, logistics, etc. And what better way than to do it in the what is arguably one of the best coffee/pastry shops on my side of the river.

My hope is that if everything goes to plan, we can move to the beta testing in another location around the city.

So, whats the plan? Not totally sure and I'm open to thought, but here's roughly what I was thinking:

10:00a: Rendezvous at the little flower

10:00-10:15a: Review menu and order pastry/food 

10:15-10:30a: Collect pastry, find a place to chill/eat. Could be inside, outside, we'll see.

10:30-11:30a: Eat carbs, talk carbs, meet new folk,  live life love or something.

11:30a+: If folks are vibin and want to continue to hang, let's do it!  Or maybe the whole thing is really awkward and we go our separate ways‚Äînever speaking of this again and let the moment be lost in time. Like tears in rain.

I'm going to start a group chat on reddit to help coordinate, so hit the thread if you want to be added and I will get you in. Depending on how this goes, we can plan to have another installment next monthish. 
After all, fall and winter is prime pastry season.

I'll be honest, like any test run, I anticipate that the turn out here will be somehow limited. Mostly due to the fact that historically, Queens meetups are unpopular in the community. Therefore even if you are not coming, please feel free to hit the thread as well and express interest. What I am looking for this initial meeting is mostly feedback and ideas.

The Little Flower Cafe is on vogue currently for being a recommended hangout for a certain political figure that ended his scavenger hunt here. If someone wants to split an order of guava pancakes, please @ me bro.

Look forward to it!

1newrdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1newrdg/aita_for_yelling_at_my_little_brother_because_his/,AITA for yelling at my little brother because his dog keeps eating my clothes?,"SUMMARY/TLDR

My younger brother's dog has eaten hundreds of dollars worth of pants to the point where I don't even have enough clothes to leave the house. It prevented me from going to a job interview. I'm disabled and use a wheelchair/cane and I can't defend against the dog. Me and my mom have had a lot of big drama and he's mad at me. I snapped at him over the whole situation after dealing with the dog for months. 

We are both young adults. 22f and 18m respectively.

This is actually becoming an active barrier to me getting a job and endangering my safety sometimes. He refuses to care for her. At the same time, I drove my mom out of the house and now our parents are separating. So I also understand why he's angry. He has every right to be upset. 

AITA?

CONTEXT:

I'm an ambulatory wheelchair user, but I've only been able to walk with the cane since early August. I fell down the stairs and then hit by a car a year while recovering from that. I then discovered I have a chronic muscular condition. That was two years ago.

I'm also partially deaf and have hearing aids, but I am fully speaking.

My mother and I have a rocky relationship. WhenI attempted suicide at 13 or 14, my mom told me to ""Just die then"". When I was in the hospital and the doctors thought I was hours from dying (due to a false negative and a couple misread scans), I called my mother and she yelled at me, cursed me, and then told me to never come home before I or the nurse could even get a word out. It was so bad the nurse was crying with me. I have suffered from PTSD and bipolar disorder since I was five and my mom used to deliberately use my triggers against me to provoke PTSD flashbacks, anxiety attacks, and manic episodes. She said it was meant to ""help me get over it"", but she kept doing it even after my therapist told her to stop.

My family frequently holds the things I have done during manic episodes as a kid -- usually the stuff during some of my worst med changes -- against me. They regularly bring up things I did when I was in middle school and elementary school as reasons they ""cannot trust me"". I'm always guilty until proven innocent and have to justify everything I do. If I don't tell people what I'm doing as I do it, I get blamed for something stupid later.

My parents have always seen me as incapable and kind of infantalized me. No matter how many extracurriculars I did, how well I did in school, or how hard I worked, they always treated me as disabled and different. My mom always talked about how glad she was to have a daughter, how disappointed she was when she found out I was disabled, and how difficult it is for parents to handle having disabled children. She insists that her putting up with my existence is something I should be thankful for and that she could have just given me away as a child. For a long time, I believed that.

Recently, I've kind of stopped putting up with that kind of treatment. Mainly because I made friends in HS, went to college and saw that other families aren't like that. I've been working on calling out the nonsense and setting boundaries.

My brother openly blames me for our family falling apart. He's not entirely wrong. He doesn't know most of the stuff mom actually did or just how much they restricted me. I love him, but he holds no regard for me. There have been times I've fallen out of my wheelchair and down the stairs, and he refused to help because he was watching videos on his phone. I had to injure myself further in order to get to my chair and set back my recovery by a month I was relearning to walk at the time).

I admit (for the sake of judgement) that I can be jealous of my brother, because they give him all the choices and freedom they withheld from me. Heck, I wasn't even allowed to have a door until he asked my parents to get me one when we were teenagers. I wasn't even allowed to leave the street our house was on and my parents refused to let me learn how to drive. When I was his age, I wasn't even allowed to go across the street to a coffee shop after school and hang out with friends if my parents weren't invited. He's allowed to stay out until midnight. It's not fair or right.

As an adult, I put the blame on my parents for the favouritism and I try to give my brother a lot more leeway. I let him treat me pretty badly, honestly, because he openly hates me, frequently insults me, downplays my accomplishments every chance he gets, invalidates+mocks every struggle I have, and constantly expects me to do things he knows I physically cannot do due to my disability (like carry heavy boxes or baskets). I'm trying to be patient and ignore it, because I know he has a right to be mad, but... still. It's hard.

I was at college for DC when I was injured and so I don't have a degree. I was on a full scholarship and I can't get it back at this point (my parents don't have the money to help me pay for school.) I've been desperately searching for a job, but it's the worst time for that. The rate of unemployment is really high and no one wants to hire a disabled kid without a degree. Also, some people in my area have been openly hostile and some even told me ""to let natural selection take its course"" when they realized I was disabled. At this point I have been looking for a job since January and applied to...(checking document of places I've applied) about 6,135 jobs and done 2,564 interviews. Yes, I'm trying to keeptrack. I've frequently gotten to the last round of interviews, too. I looked around for advice, but was told that it's the same for everyone and that everyone's having a hard time with it right now. Actually, the fact that I'm getting interviews about a 1/3 of the time is pretty good. I did try to get help from two local recruiter offices, but they said it's basically hopeless for anyone with disabilities right now. I've asked around but everyone I know has either been laid off, retired, or their company has no entry level openings. I did apply for social security after the job recruiter's advised me to, but my state denies all disability social security applications in order to force people to appeal them (this is not abnormal). I tried to appeal, but was told there's a huge waiting list for the local lawyers who help with it for free and that it would be a three year process... and the max amount wouldn't even cover a studio apartment. Nice.

At first, I tried to avoid coming home at all costs, but after about six months my savings were just not enough. I couch surfed for awhile, but eventually got stuck at a hotel. I called some local homeless shelters, but they were full and many of them also informed me they were not wheelchair accessible.

My parents refused to let me just live on the streets. My dad said they'd gotten a ramp set up in the garage and it was winter, so they convinced me to come home on the condition that they'd done things to make the house more accessible... only to find out there was not a ramp. It took them five months to set up the ramp. In that time, they refused to let me have anyone pick me up and refused to help me get to things. They always would say they could take me to anything I needed and then say they couldn't whenever I actually asked them to take me to dr appointments or job interviews. I continued to call homeless shelters and seek help, because I quickly realized that I was trapped and reliant on these people now -- which is very much NOT what I wanted. They had promised this wouldn't happen and said that a lot of things were in place that just... were not. So yeah.

My mom and I started fighting again. At one point, I called my friend and vented about it. My friend decided to start texting my mom to leave me alone... which was not smart. My mom came up to my room and just started screaming and pounding on my door. My friend was on the phone with me and she heard it. She called the cops. It was bad. I begged the cops to just give me a ride to a homeless shelter. I had a bag ready to go. They said my wheelchair wouldn't fit in a cop car. I'm not sure if that's true. They also advised me to carry my wheelchair down the stairs to get out of the house? Which was... kind of wild.

A few weeks after that, one of the many homeless shelters and programs I'd been calling called DHHS. DHHS called the cops. Technically what mom and dad had done was considered kidnapping/holding me hostage. Since they brought me to the house under false pretenses and then I was unable to leave. I also asked them to drive me to shelters a few times, but was told no every time. Several shelters had actually informed me that was illegal for them to do. I kind of shrugged it off at first. It was like a game of telephone and it escalated pretty badly. Cops ended up at our door. I was annoyed, because I knew it would only escalate the situation, but I still asked to be taken to a shelter. The cops refused and then left.

My mom and my dad's relationship has been rocky for about a decade. They had been threatening each other with divorce since I was in middle school. I guess this was the final straw. My mom moved out. Remember, I was asking my parents to take me to a homeless shelter or to just help me to the curb so I could be picked up by one. Like, borderline begging. My brother blamed me. He's probably right. I definitely played a part in it.

Since then, dad has admitted the only reason he didn't break up with my mom sooner was because she threatened to commit suicide if he did. He and mom kinda brought out the worst in each other. I can't say I'm sorry that I drove her out, but I am sorry for how much it hurt my brother.

My brother has hated me ever since. In spite of my jealousy (which was mostly childish fingerpointing, we'd always been closer than most siblings. He's my baby brother, you know? I would jump in front of another car for him anytime. We didn't have a lot of devices, so we had to share and just spend a lot of time together in a way siblings these days don't get to. Some of my favorite shows -- like Transformers Prime --  are only my favorite because of the memories of watching it with him. My brother has always been the one person I would die for -- the one I loved most -- and then I came back from college.

We're a very liberal family and all his new friends are MAGA according to my dad. Right off the bat, my brother mentioned some... unique opinions about disabled people and women. He's always been a bit quiet, but he was reserved and usually holding back a smile. Now he's just... cold. Hateful. Like he has no time for kindness.

He doesn't believe that I'm disabled (I have literally presented doctor notes at this point, received SNAP benefits to buy my own food, and been given a disabled placard). Now he hates me for what happened with my mom.

I have been trying my best to just give him space. Even though he often does things like fold my chair or block my ramp that does make things harder for me, I do try to be as patient with him as possible. Thing is, I'll repeatedly ask nicely for him or my dad to unfold my chair and get stuck in one room for two days (happened once) because he refuses to do it. I often do try to handle it myself first or have tried multiple times before, so when I ask for help I do usually need help. So then I do actually have to get a bit more pushy. There's been a few times (like with the chair) that I had to yell and I always feel bad about it... I try to give him space, but he's using it to walk all over me and doing things that actually endanger me.

I'm trying to give all this context to get as fair as a judgement as possible and also to explain why I'm actually questioning if I am the A-hole. If you were just looking at what's happening right now, I don't think I would be considered the a-hole. With the context, I think it does change things. A lot. 

ONTO THE ACTUAL STORY

He has a dog that he doesn't take care of. I love her, but... I'm not physically able to care for her or keep up with her. I also have a cat to take care of. It'd be one thing if he took care of her when he was home or even just played with her sometimes, but... he doesn't. He says he does, but I know he's not telling the truth because she's always with me when he says he plays with her. Not because I want her to be with me, but because she comes and refuses to leave. This would be fine if she didn't always mess with my cat and ruin my stuff.

You see, she's not well trained. She pees on the floor to be obstinate. She steals food out of people's hands and will purposely trip people carrying food in order to steal it. When I was like 17 she bit me hard enough to bleed when I was trying to break up a fight between her and my cat because the dog was stealing my cat's food. I love her, but... She's very badly behaved. That's not her fault, though. She's a really sweet dog most of the time. She's just really badly trained. This is a longstanding issue with my family's pets. Our childhood cat peed all over the floor and never used the litterbox, for example.

I worked really hard to train my cat. She's good about using the litter box and she doesn't eat people food. She comes when her name is called and even alerts me to sounds and alarms that I can't hear. Her shots are always up to date. When she's unwell, I notice right away. She's prone to ear infections and I know exactly what the symptoms are + have some over the counter medicine to treat mild cases on hand. I'm over prepared if anything. We have a doggy door that is self-locking. However, it's run out of battery and they won't replace it. I just keep my cat in my room. She's a good kitty, so that's manageable -- even if that does mean having a litter box a yard from my bed. However, that is obviously not ideal.

So I get kind of frustrated with my brother, because I have had to make sacrifices in order to make my pet manageable for others, but he's on his phone and playing around until midnight with his friends instead of taking his dog on a walk. It's really bad. I tried to grab my cane and take her on a walk, but she pulls so hard that I kept falling over and it was so bad a nice lady actually ended up having to help me. The dog was a lot calmer and well behaved for the rest of the day after that though -- which kind of confirmed the problem. Both my mom and my dad have admitted that the dog is acting out for attention. My dad didn't want the dog from the start, but mom's apartment doesn't take pets and my brother says he wants her even if he doesn't act like it.

Then, it all got worse. The vet said the dog needed special food due to medical issues, but she refuses to eat it. She's knocking over trash cans, lunging and snatching bread, biting me in order to get me to drop food, and then she realized that the crotch of my underpants tastes like period blood. I have a blood clotting disorder so my periods are really, really severe.

She's started eating my underwear, so then I had to go without and she started eatign the crotch of my pants. She eats the crotch out of everything I own whether it's got period blood on it or not. She'll snap her teeth at me if I try to stop her. She darts into the bathroom when I'm getting out of the shower to steal my clothes. If I leave them in a basket, she will get to them. She even knocked over a hamper to steal them at one point.

I can't use the washer in my house. For one, it's down in the basement which is physically painful for me to use regularly. There are 25 - 30 steps between the shower & my room and the basement. More importantly, though, it's too deep. I can get the clothes into the washer but I can't get them out of the washer. It was hard to reach that far when I was able bodied. Now bending like that sends excruciating sparks of pain up my sides and leaves my lower back and abdomen burning for hours. I also can't carry a basket or anything. I'm not able to lift more than ten pounds without risking further damaging my muscular system and ending up with even less mobility than I have now. I was going to handwash stuff -- which is what I was doing at other places -- but my dad threw away the detergent soap bar I had. I have a lot of allergies so the detergent soap bar I can use isn't cheap. I'm working on getting a new one, but my brother also threw out my wash boards. I have one smaller one, but it's not any good for bigger things of clothes. My brother and my dad don't ever bring back half of the clothes I give them to wash. I don't know where they go. They're just gone.

Since a lot of my clothes are dirty, I thought she was only going after dirty clothes for a long time, but then I had a bunch of clothes fresh out of the washer. I was sorting them out in the living room and she went after those, too! So I had to shove all of the pants into bags so she wouldn't steal them out of the basket while fending off a dog that was jumping all over me and trying to bite the clothes I was holding. It's ridiculous. I've even gotten some vaginal infections from wearing things she chewed on that were clean prior to her chewing on them. It's so dumb, but it's genuinely a huge problem.

At this point, I'm having to constantly leave the bathroom full of clothes with the door closed, because this dog keeps eating all of my clothes.

And these aren't cheap clothes either. I'm talking like expensive slacks and stuff, because I'm going to job interviews all the time right now. It's really frustrating

I have been begging my brother to do something -- anything -- about it for a long time. Last week, I had to miss a job interview, because my dog has stolen every pair of pants I own. We're talking like 30 pairs of nice pants at least. Probably closer to twice that. Like, I have had to fill entire trash bags of my clothes with the crotch gone. Each pair ranges between $30 and $150. I haven't even saved that much since getting SNAP benefits, because all that grocery money now goes to paying for my freaking pants. It's so dumb.

I tell my brother to play with his dog so she'll stop seeking attention like this. My brother insists that he has no time and that I should tell him if I see him having time. When I see him watching youtube on his phone, I tell him and he says he's tired and that he'll do it later.

Several times, I had to cancel JOB INTERVIEWS, because my brother let his friend use the bathroom overnight, his friend left the door open, and then the dog went and destroyed the outfit that I put in there before I went to bed so it would be safe from my cat sitting on it or her eating it. Sometimes, I'm able to order amazon last minute, but I literally cannot make plans because I never know if I'll have clothes. I'm at my wit's end. I've been asking as nicely as I can and getting increasinly urgent, but it's in one ear and out the other.

Today I snapped.

I heard my brother downstairs today at 9:40 pm. He said he had just finished cooking and eating dinner and was sitting on his phone. I suggested that he play with his dog. I asked casually at first, but he didn't hear me, so I asked again. He asked me to ask louder, so I did and then he told me to stop yelling at him. So I said sorry and then repeated my request -- kind but firm. He refused, so I got a little more urgent and explained that she'd burst into my room, knocked over a bunch of my stuff, and kept eating my clothes. He then said that he'd just gotten home. To which I pointed out that it was getting late and there wasn't another time to ask. He then repeated he had just gotten home. I then pointed out that he had just told me that he'd cooked a whole meal and eaten it, so clearly he'd been home for awhile. He then started shouting that'd he'd just gotten home and he'd been at school and work all day. I then tried to explain that I really needed him to do this and that he was never home, so I needed to say this before he went off with his friends again. He just kept yelling and then my dad started yelling. He automatically sided with my brother -- as my parents have done since we were in elementary school -- and so I backed off.

(for the record, my brother chooses to cook his own meals because he doesn't like the food my dad, my mom, or me make. I tried to go vegan once and got in huge trouble for being ungrateful or not sharing my food with everyone when I tried to cook my own meals at 16 -- and unlike him I bought my own food! My parents' double standards are crazy sometimes. Not his fault. It's theirs. Just bewilders me how stark the difference is. I still get weird side eyes when I choose to eat food I bought for dinner.)

So then an hour later I saw him on his phone again and I asked him to please play with her. He first lied that he took her for a walk yesterday. He didn't. She was with me Wednesday and Tuesday afternoon. I went to an event at 5 yesterday afternoon, but she was with me until then. When I got home at 9,  he and his friends had blocked the garage with a project they'd been working on. The dog was way too hyper to have been walked and was bothering nonstop until she finally settled down beside me. He came home hours later. He was asleep or not home in the mornings.

I called him out on that. He didn't even bother to give any sort of reasoning against it, so I must have been right. I tried to ask him again -- explaining that she'd gotten into my room today, chased my cat around, knocked over a trashcan, nearly knocked over a shelf, and stolen more of my underwear. He then told me that I should just pick up my clothes out of the bathroom (they're in there because she keeps eating them and attacks me when I try to move them) and that she doesn't eat clean clothes (which is false but he never believes me when I tell him that).

I snapped. He just refused to listen. I've been putting up with this for months. I started out just raising my voice and arguing. He kept just saying the same two points over and over again which haven't been working and cutting me off. He wouldn't listen to a word I said. Just sitting there on his phone. I called him lazy and he said he'd been working all day. He then brought up my lack of employment and asked who I was to call him lazy. As if I haven't been working my butt off to try and find a job. As if I hadn't always had to work ten times harder than him just to be treated like a human being. As if I didn't do way more at his age.

Prior to being disabled, I did way more work at his age and I did it for free as a volunteer , because I wasn't allowed to work. Even in college, my parents kept trying to stop me from working. But I got full ride scholarships because I had done over 700 hours of volunteer work every year, four different extracurriculars, and was a B+ student at a college prep school -- which I also got into on a scholarship. He works a minimum wage part time job, spends a couple hours every other week at his youth group (and always tries to get out of it, and only works on his car. Which is probably more than most kids, but it is nothing compared to what I did. I singlehandedly raised like $15,000 for charity through planning a color run and an ice skating festival. I performed at local mainstage productions. I was making presentations to hundreds of psychiatrists, because I'd discovered a unique method of using theater, storytelling, and montessori methods helps people with Alzheimers and dementia by constantly working with people with Alzheimers and dementia.

So I kept yelling. I told him that she is his dog and it is his responsibility. I said it was crazy that I was even having to put up with this. I pointed out that I'd lost hundreds of dollars worth of clothes and that I'd missed job interviews because of this. He said that was my problem and I just started screaming. I was crying from frustration.

My dad yelled at me. He said it was innappropriate. He said he doesn't want the dog here either, but mom doesn't want to take her. I told him that doesn't solve the problem and that she's acting out for attention. She's my brother's dog. It's his responsibility. Feed the dog, clean up after the dog, walk the dog... it's just common knowledge. My dad just repeated himself and walked away, disappointed.

I do feel bad for yelling at my brother, though. I think I might have gone overboard a little. It's just... really hard to deal with. It's expensive and I physically can't fight off a dog. I'm not sure what to do. I am calling homeless shelters again, because at this rate it is preventing me from being able to go outside in anything other than a dress -- and that's if I can find leggings or underwear. There are days I have to sit in a dress without underwear until an amazon package arrives with stuff. During those days, my brother's friends are here and it's always really uncomfortable, too. He refuses to tell me when they are here, so it's often a surprise.

He then said, ‚ÄúIt must be done by the end of the week.‚Äù He then left the store, and all of a sudden, I got this weight on my chest, followed by the worst heartburn I've ever felt. To add on to that, my painting arm started to feel really sore and like I could barely move it.

I thought I was having a heart attack, so I decided to get into my car and drive down to the hospital. When I got down there, I told them that I was having chest pains, so they took me in instantly. They checked my heart rate, and it was completely normal, but the chest pain was still there, and if anything, it had gotten worse since I set foot in this hospital. Just then, I fell to the ground.

¬†I¬† then found myself walking aimlessly in a black void with nothing but a lantern then it started getting really hot. All of the sudden I was in a fiery landscape with screams of countless men and women, for some reason I felt like I was walking to someone and after a few minutes I saw him the guy with the black trench coat and black rimmed glasses with red lenses he then said ‚Äúmake it through this pain and you will have wealth untold ‚Äú¬†

I then woke up with IV tubes in my arms and a pastor next to my bedside. The pastor then spoke, ‚ÄúMy child, what you have done was a terrible, terrible mistake, one that I can't help you with. What have I done ?‚Äù You have made a deal with one of the 3 devils,‚Äù I..I don't believe you.‚Äù Just then, I tore the IV tubes from my arms, some of my skin coming with it, and ran out of the hospital. The strangest thing is, though, there was no blood whatsoever coming from my arm.

When I finally made it back to my paint shop I grabbed my easel, my brushes and the paints I needed and started painting at one point during the painting process I ran out of red paint so I looked down my arm which, conveniently started bleeding and I realized it was the perfect red for the painting so I grabbed an empty brush and dipped into my bloody arm and continued to paint.

It ended up taking 4 days of non-stop painting for me to finally finish this piece. It was like there was a paranormal force that kept me determined to finish the painting. By the end of day four, my eyes were swollen and bloody, my breathing was labored, and my hands were bleeding from so many repetitive fast motions. That's when I heard the bell from the front door meaning someone had entered ‚ÄúHuh yeah I‚Äôll be right there ‚Äú just then I managed to pull myself out to the counter to see who it was, it was the man ‚Äúyeesh my man you look like you crawled out of the depths of hell .you definitely have seen better days ‚Äú he said ‚Äúis my painting finished? ‚Äú He asked with a toothy grin on his face, ‚ÄúYes, it is, let me go grab it‚Äù. I then slogged over to the room where the painting was, and I grabbed it and gave it to the man. He said, ‚ÄúThis is a truly wonderful, wonderful piece, thank you,‚Äù and he left the store.

I then looked down at my arm, which had stopped bleeding a while ago, and I found there was a bracer on my arm with this material¬† I didn't recognize. It looked like a mix of gold and wood. I then went to sleep, but my sleep didn't last long because I heard the front door going off repeatedly. I then went to check who it was.

I was shocked to see that my store was packed to the brim with customers all with my paintings. I was ecstatic because this was the most customers I had ever had in my store at one time I then proceeded to ring them all up. I ended up making well over 2000 dollars, which meant I could go get a hot meal with one of my friends.¬†

This particular friend owned a library called ‚ÄúThe Sanctum Of Memoirs‚Äù¬† so I called him up¬† ‚Äúhello to whom am I speaking¬† ‚Äú oh hey this is Claude I was just wondering if you wanted to go get some steak or something‚Äù oh yeah I can't do that today, very busy; sorry‚Äù oh yeah that's fine‚Äù I then hung up.

After eating, I decided to go to my store, which was basically my home, and paint. While I was walking to my store, I noticed throughout the entirety of the walk that someone had been following me. When I would turn a corner, they followed behind when I would speed up, so would they. It got to the point where I had to pull out my blade, which was hidden inside my paintbrush. I uncapped the knife and started turning and turning, but no one was there.

I turned back around, and there, right in front of me, was a very mutilated man. He had black eyes and white hair. ‚ÄúVin‚Ä¶Vincent? Wh‚Ä¶ what happened to you?‚Äù I had known Vincent for a long time. He was actually the one who had purchased my very first easel. Just then, the man lunged at me, and reacting quickly, I took my knife and stabbed the man in the throat.

Just then, my eyes adjusted, and there, on the ground, wasn't Vincent, it was some random guy and as I was still coming down from the shock of murdering someone, I watched as the body just vanished, the blood along with it.

I rushed back to my shop, panicked, breathing heavily, and sweat dripping down my face. Once I got there, I immediately went to my sink to wash the blood off my hands. Once I did, I felt this violent urge to paint something, and so paint something I did. I ended up painting a landscape of a cow in a field next to a bale of hay with a pitchfork inside it . The next day a lot of people ended up buying more paintings, and I made a whole lot more money. One guy in particular was a farmer and he bought the painting I had made just last night.

That night I fell asleep. I woke to find myself on a farm, and I was holding a pitchfork with a bale of hay on the end of it. I took the pitchfork and put it pointy side up in a wooden fence with the other bales of hay.

I then went over to the barn doors to grab the milking stools so I could go milk my cows, once I grabbed it I went over to the cows and started milking the first cow was fine with being milked but the other one was very irritated before I even got to the cow the cow kicked me and I went flying towards the pitchfork.

Just then, I woke up in a cold sweat. ‚ÄúH..h..thank God that was just a dream, that was awful.‚Äù I then got up out of bed¬†

And went to make myself some coffee and cereal. I then made the coffee and the bowl of cereal and went to eat them. While I was eating, I decided to switch on the news, there on the news was the Farmer, he had a pitchfork in his face and hay all over his body.

I started thinking about the dream I had last night and how the painting he bought kind of lined up with how he died. I started thinking, ‚ÄúDid I paint his death?‚Äù but then I stopped myself because that was impossible‚Ä¶ Right.

Just then, I heard the bell on the front door ring, and in walked that farmer with a pitchfork in his face, dripping blood all over my nice mahogany floor. I let out a scream, and then, I woke up my face in my cereal bowl . After I woke up, I cleaned my face off and went to paint. While I was painting, I decided to look out of the window¬†

When I did, I saw the guy looking in at me; his face grinning so hard I thought it would start bleeding. Just then, he disappeared into a red puff of smoke and appeared in my painting room. ‚ÄúSo, chap, how did you like making all that money‚ÄùI loved it i was finally able to get some hot lunch‚Äùthink its high time i told you my name , they call me Lyle.‚Äù Lyle huh? Nice name , want to grab a bite?‚Äù sure.‚Äù

So we got in the car and drove off to the restaurant, while we were in the restaurant, all the people seemed terrified of something, even though to me, there was nothing wrong. For example, when the waiter was bringing us our food and drinks, she started freaking out and screaming like she was possessed. The next day I decided to go to church, but the second I stepped in, the pastor started yelling and screaming at me

to get out. When I asked him why, all he did was scream, ‚Äúdevil, devil, demon, get out. ‚Äúhe practically chased me out of the church

The next night I felt the urge to paint again. This time I painted 2 things. I painted a black hand with 3 bloody crystals and I also painted a girl with one arm in front of a burning house.

When morning came l turned on the news to see the headline ‚Äúsomething attacks ambulance ‚ÄúI then looked at the painting I made and paused the news to find, the hand on the news was identical to the one in my painting. I ended up getting so caught up in my thoughts that hours passed by. Of course, I would ring up customers when they would buy stuff but it just lingered in the front facets of my mind.

At around 9:05, a woman walked in I immediately recognized this woman; she was a famous psychiatrist named Erika. ‚ÄúHey, Dr. Erika, to what do I owe the pleasure? ‚ÄúOh, hey, Claude, how's it going? ‚ÄúPretty good, actually. ‚ÄúCan I get that painting right there? ‚ÄúWhich one?‚Äù The one with the bloody arm holding crystals, I LOVE CRYSTALS!!!‚Äù Yeah, I know of course, you can get that one it's 85.55 ‚Äúyeesh kinda steep i‚Äôll pay it though‚Äù.

I then rang her up and went through the rest of my day. I flicked on the news and saw that someone got in a really bad car crash , just then I saw the guy again. This time I was more suspicious of him because of my previous experience with him. ‚ÄúGreetings Lyle ‚Äú I said scowling at him as I did ‚Äú what's your problem man ?‚Äù He asked ‚Äúweird question ,but what's under those glasses?‚Äù You don't want to know !‚Äù Just then I picked up my paintbrush and flung it at the guy's glasses ,knocking them off in his eyes. They were just flames.¬†

‚Äú What are you? You don't need to know‚Äù his voice echoing ‚Äúno one will believe you ‚Äú he said as he vanished.

That night¬† I was at my desk and just then I found myself walking down a street towards a house I didn't recognize which I walked in only to find a lot of crystals. I then realized whose house this was; it was Erika's. I was wondering, ‚ÄúAm I in Erika's body?‚Äù Just then, I started walking over to my computer and started typing some stuff into a notes app. I typed in¬†

‚ÄúLia Smith

Age:36¬†

Nationality: Canadian

Came to me telling me about this whistle she had been hearing every day for the last 30 years. I asked her what kind of things she was experiencing, and he told me that when she heard the whistle, her vision went dark and she would fall over. I then told her to tell me more about her symptoms. She said that when she saw the monster on television, she felt a connection to it.¬†

To be honest, I don't think that she has schizophrenia, seeing as none of her symptoms line up with it¬†

¬†

Schizophrenia Diagnosis: NEGATIVE‚Äù

I then started typing ‚ÄúParanormal Entity that whistles, ‚Äú and¬† ‚Äú El Silbon ‚Äú showed up, but I was looking at the things this spirit does, and it didn‚Äôt line up with what she was experiencing .¬†

Just then, I heard a crash. It startled me, so I grabbed my shotgun from the wall, shotgun in my hand, I slowly walked towards the door, but then I heard a knock from the other side of the door, and the knocking was in a familiar tune. After a few knocks, my door flies off its hinges, and I get flown back, and in walks this giant black lanky monster

Immediately, I started firing and shot one of its arms off, and it started yowling in pain, so I went for another shot, but then the creature knocked the gun out of my hands. I grabbed a chair to try to defend myself, but it grabbed my neck and started squeezing. The creature then walks me over to my box of crystals and starts smashing my face into the box over and over again. The creature then takes my lifeless body and throws it out of the nearest window, and I start falling.

Just then I awoke in a cold sweat my heart racing ‚Äú oh God damn these fuckin dreams ,these are awful‚Äù I looked outside and it was night time so I made myself a meal and turned on the tv . On the tv was Erika Dead. Her teeth were broken and cracked, and she had an amethyst seemingly embedded into her right eye and a more horizontal mirror-ish looking quartz in her other eye, and in her forehead was a peridot crystal, and further down her body looked to be a gash seemingly from some sort of glass .

Just then the front doorbell rang and in walked Erika with 3 crystals in her face she was sobbing and she told me to help her ,her breathing syrupy ‚Äú I ‚Ä¶ I can't‚Äù I then woke up . I then knew it was true I was painting their deaths ‚ÄúI'm getting everything I've ever wanted but is it really worth it if I'm killing all these people‚ÄùI thought to myself.Just then I watched as a black hand scurried under the door and stole a painting ,it was the painting of the burning house and the girl with the one arm .¬†

I then called Vincent ‚Äúhey man what's up I'm driving Erika home‚Äù¬† i am freaking the fuck out right now ‚Äú why what's wrong ? ‚ÄúMy paintings are killing people ‚Äú what are you talikng about‚Äú I painted that Farmer guys death and Erika‚Äôs death ‚Äú calm down man ‚Äú I then told him about the house painting going missing and what the girl looked like ‚Äú yeah I've seen a girl like that ,know where she lives too‚Äù keep an eye on her‚Äù He then hung up on me¬†

A few hours later and I finally managed to calm myself down by taking some Zoloft I just had laying around, I figured that I was just being crazy earlier. ‚ÄúI'm killing them with my paintings‚Äùsounded ridiculous to me now so I went to go paint . I ended up painting a lady standing in front of a train .

The next day a lady came in ,looked almost exactly like the woman in my painting ;her demeanor was very sad her head hung low and she didn't talk much.When I did get a look at her ,her eyes were red as if she'd been crying for a long time and her body looked very frail like she hadn't eaten in a long time I asked her if she was okay and even offered her some food but she said no,bought the painting and left.I don't know why but when she walked in I felt the room‚Äôs temperature drop like 10 degrees like I could feel her sadness ,that coldness lasted the rest of the day. Later that night I found myself walking to through a graveyard to a tombstone the tombstone read¬†

Erika Rose

1987-2018

I then said ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I'm so sorry little sis ,I wasn't there to protect you; I was recovering from a coma‚Äù I then laid some flowers down and walked away. I caught a glimpse of myself. My eyes were red¬† from crying so much and my figure was frail. Just then I hailed a taxi and when I got in he asked‚Äùwhere to ‚ÄúI responded ‚Äú I have a train to catch‚Äù .

When I got to the train tracks I was walking very slowly, the rain hitting harder than it ever had. Each step I took felt like it took forever but I finally got to the ideal spot and I waited for a train to finally come and when one finally did I fell forward.

I then woke up and started sobbing knowing what was to come. I hesitantly walked to my tv and turned the news on, the headline read ‚Äúgirl jumps in front of a train‚Äù just then I knew what I had to do . I called a priest and told him I'm sorry I did the same for all my friends and then I started to paint.

I asked her to we go for coffee and she agreed to it. Today we went for coffee and there were three chairs, I sat on the right she sat in the middle and we put stuff in the middle.

A lot of people have small amounts of USDC just sitting in their wallet. Not enough to trade, too awkward to off ramp, basically wasted.

*This is the pain point our team set out to solve.*

With **OwlPay Wallet Pro**, those balances can now be put to use. You can turn them into gift cards and spend them on everyday things.

Here‚Äôs why people are finding it useful:

* Handy in a pinch when you need food delivery or a ride, just grab a gift card in seconds
* No need for cards or banks, which helps when payment methods fail
* Even a few dollars of USDC can cover coffee, a subscription, or a Roblox gift card
* Makes the Web3 wallet part of a daily routine, like redeeming one card a day  

The best part is how frictionless it feels. You are no longer thinking about exchange rates or off ramps. Your crypto balance simply turns into something you can use today.

That is the shift we are most excited about, making stablecoins practical in everyday life.

Got some spare USDC lying around? Try turning it into something you will actually use this week.",2,1757661739.0,cryptos,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôd been crying on and off all morning. Tears coming and going when I least expected them. Emotional for no clear reason. People I knew at work kept asking me if I was okay. I simply brushed it off, as I‚Äôve been exhausted and busy from work as of recent. It felt easier to say. But deep down I knew it wasn‚Äôt. I kept searching for something to blame these strange feelings on. There had to be some explanation as to why I felt so raw, so cracked open. It felt like intuition, almost like I predicted the moment without knowing it. 

And then I saw him in a coffee shop. The guy I dated back in college. It wasn‚Äôt for long, but he changed me in ways I can never forget. He pulled me out of my shell, taught me things, and made me want to be a better person.  He was a turning point in my story.

I never thought I‚Äôd see him again. That chapter has always felt sealed shut. It took me some time, but I was content to have finally come to terms with that. But suddenly, there he was, in front of me after all these years. Proof that he exists outside of my memories.

My heart pounded out of my chest. Not because I‚Äôm still in love with him. It wasn‚Äôt butterflies. It was the weight of everything I‚Äôd built up in my head over the years. He didn‚Äôt know it but I spoke to him all the time. All the imaginary conversations where I‚Äôd tell him what he meant to me or ask him why he didn‚Äôt love me. And yet when it happened, I said nothing. I just walked away.

And strangely, that felt okay. Maybe our paths crossed again only to pass. Maybe I didn‚Äôt need closure after all. Just seeing that he was still real, present, alive in this world, not just someone I made up.

He was the spark changed my life‚Äôs direction. The truth is, if I‚Äôd never met him back then, I think I‚Äôd still be that scared little girl. But I‚Äôm not.

It wasn‚Äôt romantic. It wasn‚Äôt about wanting anything from him. It was surreal. It was nostalgic. And it left me with a quiet sense of peace, knowing that part of my past is still out there, even if I‚Äôve moved on.",1,1757661327.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

seriously tho... i spent $200 on this productivity course last month. guess how much i finished? 12 minutes. TWELVE MINUTES out of 8 hours of content

And its not just me being lazy (ok maybe a little). but like information is EVERYWHERE now. youtube has 500 hour courses on literally everything. udemy keeps sending me emails about their 40 hour python bootcamp. my linkedin feed is full of ""experts"" selling 6 week programs.

when do i actually learn stuff? on the toilet scrolling tiktok. waiting for my coffee. during commercial breaks. those random 2am wikipedia rabbit holes

I realized i learn better in tiny chunks. like when someone explains something in 2 minutes on reddit instead of linking me to a 45 page pdf. or when my friend texts me a quick tip instead of sending their entire self help library

Anyone else feel like traditional learning is broken? like we're still stuck in this ""sit down for 2 hours and focus"" mindset when nobody actually has 2 hours anymore

what works for you guys? are you:

short form (tiktok explanations, reddit comments, youtube shorts)

 long form (full courses, books, documentaries)

chaos (random google searches at 3am)

""i'll learn it when i need it"" (my personal favorite)

also what topics do you actually want to learn vs what you THINK you should learn? i keep buying business courses but end up watching 5 minute videos about ancient rome instead lol

edit: wow this blew up. reading all your comments and realizing we're all just winging it with 47 browser tabs open

\[TLDR\]‚úÖ : bought expensive course, watched 12 mins. realized i learn better from 2 min tiktoks than 3 hour lectures. what's your learning style?

Last Sunday I spent a very pleasant afternoon stripping the machine down, properly cleaning out the limescale and doing a full service.  Mostly it was just being patient with using vinegar to soften the calcium and then carefully use a set of small soft polishing brushes on my drill so I didn't risk marring the mating surfaces of the boiler.

The brass turned bright pink as a result of dezincification; the acid of the limescale remover etches off the top layer of zinc leaving a higher concentration of copper.

1newc8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1newc8g/second_viewing_some_thoughts_on_lorelai/,Second viewing: some thoughts on Lorelai,"Spoilers ahead :) 


I‚Äôm on my second viewing of Gilmore Girls, and this time around I‚Äôm noticing things I completely missed before. Beneath the cozy banter and coffee-fueled charm, the show is really a sad story about Lorelai. She never truly grew up.

She built her identity on ‚Äúrunning away‚Äù from her wealthy upbringing, but in reality she only moved a short drive from Hartford. She performs independence while still relying on her parents for Rory‚Äôs tuition, business loans, and a safety net whenever things get difficult. Her rebellion looks more like image than sacrifice.

Her romantic choices reveal the same pattern. Lorelai talks about protecting Rory and only dating serious men, yet she gets involved with Rory‚Äôs teacher and nearly marries him. She keeps circling back to Christopher, her unreliable first love, and gets swept up by men who mirror her old world more than they actually suit her. Luke, the one man who is steady and grounded, stays ‚Äújust Luke‚Äù for years because he doesn‚Äôt fit her fantasy.

One of the harshest truths comes from Paris, who bluntly points out that only someone easily impressed would fall for Max. Paris doesn‚Äôt sugarcoat, and that moment exposes Lorelai‚Äôs habit of confusing charm and surface-level sophistication with real substance. It also gives Rory a small but sharp disillusionment about her mom ‚Äî she sees that Lorelai is flawed, na√Øve, and sometimes driven more by fantasy than reality.

Even in her 30s and 40s, Lorelai clings to the identity of the cool teen mom who eats junk food, avoids responsibility, and performs rebellion with fast talk and wit. She resents Emily for being controlling, but her pushback often feels more like a teenager‚Äôs tantrum than an adult‚Äôs reckoning.

On a rewatch, the show feels very different. What seemed like a charming story about a woman who made it on her own is actually the portrait of someone who reinvented herself at 16 but never left adolescence behind. Lorelai chases validation, fantasy, and excitement long after she should have learned to embrace stability and substance, and moments like Paris‚Äôs critique make that painfully clear.

1newa7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntingJob/comments/1newa7r/the_hidden_job_market_crisis_of_2025_why_80_of/,The Hidden Job Market Crisis of 2025: Why 80% of Applicants Never Stand a Chance (Data Analysis Inside),"After analyzing thousands of job applications and hiring patterns over the past year, I've uncovered some disturbing trends that explain why so many qualified candidates are struggling. This isn't just another ""job market is tough"" post - this is about systematic issues that are breaking the hiring process.

**The ATS Black Hole: A Technical Breakdown**

Let's start with the elephant in the room - Applicant Tracking Systems. These aren't just simple keyword matchers anymore. Modern ATS systems use:

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** that scores semantic relevance, not just keyword matches
* **Predictive scoring algorithms** that compare you to successful employees' profiles
* **Integration with social media APIs** that pull additional data points
* **Knockout questions** that auto-reject 40% of applicants before resume review

Here's what's shocking: Fortune 500 companies use an average of 3.4 different screening tools before human review. Your resume passes through Workday, then HireVue, then Pymetrics, then finally maybe reaches a human. Each filter eliminates approximately 25-30% of remaining candidates.

**The Ghost Job Phenomenon: Why Companies Post Fake Openings**

My research identified four categories of ghost jobs:

1. **Evergreen Postings (34%)**: Companies keeping ""always open"" posts for high-turnover roles
2. **Talent Pipeline Building (28%)**: Collecting resumes for anticipated future needs
3. **Market Intelligence (22%)**: Gauging competitor talent and salary expectations
4. **Internal Politics (16%)**: Posted to satisfy internal requirements when they already have a candidate

I tracked 500 job postings across major job boards for 6 months. Results:

* 38% were never filled
* 24% were reposted identically every 30 days
* 18% had internal candidates already selected

**The Algorithm Arms Race: How AI is Breaking Both Sides**

Candidates are using AI to write resumes. Companies are using AI to screen them. This creates a bizarre feedback loop:

* ChatGPT-written resumes all use similar phrases (""leveraged,"" ""spearheaded,"" ""synergized"")
* ATS systems are now programmed to flag these AI-generated patterns
* Genuine, human-written resumes sometimes score LOWER because they don't hit the ""expected"" phrases
* Hiring managers report spending MORE time screening because they can't trust initial filters

**The Real Data on What's Working in 2025**

I analyzed 1,247 successful job placements (people who got hired in the last 6 months) and found:

**Application Strategy:**

* Successful candidates applied to average of 47 jobs (vs. 156 for unemployed over 6 months)
* 67% got hired through ""warm"" connections (referrals, networking, direct outreach)
* Only 19% got hired through traditional job board applications
* 14% created their own opportunity (reaching out to companies not actively hiring)

**Resume Optimization:**

* Successful resumes averaged 475 words (not too short, not too long)
* Used 60-70% match rate with job description keywords (not 100% - that's flagged as suspicious)
* Included 5-7 quantified achievements
* Had ZERO creative formatting (ATS can't parse it)

**Timeline Reality:**

* Average time from application to offer: 58 days
* Number of interviews for successful placement: 4.3
* Callback rate for customized applications: 21%
* Callback rate for generic applications: 2%

**The Geographic Discrimination Nobody Talks About**

ATS systems are now using location-based filtering aggressively:

* 71% of remote jobs still filter by geographic location
* Candidates within 15 miles of office have 3.4x higher callback rate
* ZIP code discrimination is real - certain areas flagged as ""high turnover risk""

**Industry-Specific Breakdown: Where the Jobs Actually Are**

Analyzing BLS data against actual hiring:

**Growing (Actually Hiring):**

* Healthcare: +312,000 real openings (but 67% require specific licenses)
* Skilled trades: +245,000 openings (average 2.3 applicants per position)
* Government: +189,000 openings (average 127 days to hire)

**Deceiving (Ghost Jobs):**

* Tech: 73% of posted jobs are ghost positions
* Marketing: 61% never intended to hire externally
* Finance: 54% already have internal candidates

**The Salary Transparency Loophole**

Even with new laws, companies found workarounds:

* Posting ranges like ""$50,000 - $250,000""
* Using ""DOE"" (depending on experience) despite legal requirements
* Hiding actual salary in bonus/equity structures

Real data: Actual offers average 67% of posted maximum range.

**What This Means: Actionable Strategy**

Based on this analysis, here's what actually works:

1. **The 80/20 Rule**: Spend 80% effort on 20% of applications. Five highly customized applications beat 50 generic ones.

1. **The LinkedIn Backdoor**: 43% of successful candidates messaged hiring managers directly BEFORE applying. This flags your application internally.

1. **The ATS Hack**: Submit two applications - one ATS-optimized (plain text, keyword-rich) and one human-optimized (designed, readable) directly to hiring manager.

1. **The Follow-Up Formula**: Day 1 apply, Day 3 LinkedIn connection, Day 7 email, Day 14 final follow-up. This sequence has 34% response rate vs. 4% for application alone.

1. **The Network Multiplier**: Every coffee chat has 5.3x ROI over cold applications. One referral equals approximately 47 cold applications.

**The Tool Stack That Actually Helps**

Through testing, these categories of tools show measurable impact:

* ATS analyzers (improve callback rate by average 23%)
* Application trackers (reduce time-to-offer by 15 days average)
* Network CRM systems (increase warm leads by 340%)

I've been building and testing strategies at HiHired ([www.hihired.org](https://www.hihired.org/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social)) specifically to address these systematic issues. The platform focuses on beating ATS systems while maintaining authenticity.

**Conclusion: The System is Broken, But Not Unbeatable**

The job market isn't just ""competitive"" - it's structurally flawed. But understanding these flaws is the first step to exploiting them. The winners in 2025 won't be the most qualified candidates; they'll be the ones who understand the game.

Creative Meeting With Sheila As Door Greeter. Mary Tells Sandy Sheila's Her Unpaid Intern, And Forfeits Her Salary To Mary While Mary Fills Her Roles. Nora Lectures An Angry Sheila, They Briefly Give In To Their Mutual Desire.","Mary's perspective

It was a bold move, but perfectly valid per contract law. As long as Sheila was an officially certified Queen Of Mean Slave, and the party contracting us (In this case The Perseverance) designated me her domme, she fell under our chain of command on set during shooting. What did that mean in practical terms? 

I got Sheila's seat in all meetings, in this case, a creative consult on the script before we started shooting. I still had a job for my slave prop, she was our doorway greeter for the Ready Room where we held the meeting. She faced the monitor on the wall outside of the door to the Ready Room. In full ChoeJoe Costume, with her lovely assets hanging out. Someone announced their name and business, Sheila had a control in her right fist to buzz my laptop. She announces their prescence to me when I deign to accept her call. She is locked at attention, I unlock her to turn, bow, and greet them by name; stepping aside for them to enter. Then she has to execute a perfect (And it better be perfect or her nipples, clit and ass get a shock from me!) about face, resume her post at the monitor.

It gave me more power then they were obviously comfortable with, but they were contracting a Queen Of Mean Employee, and  putting her in charge of their sub, who's Bottom Slave Designation meant I could activate her clause as a QOM Sub contractor, and my subordinate, at least during working hours on set. I even had her issued a second security badge during working hours that identified her as a QOM subcontractor, and Mistress Mary Williamson's Personal Slave during working hours.

Okay it was a Petty Flex. But the fact that she needed to get used to my authority and functioning in the suit were valid points even her friends couldn't refute. Not that those clowns weren't working to undermine and negate my authority over her any underhanded way they could. Deep breath, Mary. Those ""clowns"" were my colleagues right now, I had to be professional. I could treat my little prop like shit to work out my frustrations. Again within reason. When her friends were watching. If  I could get her where they couldn't...

Right now to my right in sharp skirt suits are Lara and Nora. Chief Screen Writer and Assistant Chief Screenwriter respectively. To my left, in Daisy Dukes and a tight  pink shirt saying ""Daddy's Princess"" is Creative Consultant Sandy O'Keefe Connor. Despite her tough, tomboyish demeanour, she radiates a wild chaotic, feminine energy that really is distracting to my Sapphic side. I have to push thoughts of tying up the little minx and tearing off her slutty clothes aside to focus. I can see why Dave is so smitten with her, she is really a sex kitten.

Had to remind myself she is every bit as smart as her big sister under that ""simple redneck girl"" demeanor. Just the cool way she is examining her sister's suit remote tells me that. She isn't trying to hide she is examining it to make sure I'm not arbitrarily cutting off her sister's hydration or screwing with her environmental controls to torment her. Trust me baby doll, we won't get to that until shooting. When I can justify it as disciplining my prop.

Also, the Autopunishment Domme's Voice Stress  Protocol is  voice enabled, Miss Sandy is knowledgeable on the suits, but she can't tell at a glance I activated them.
The suit's AI picks up my voice stress when I talk to the slave. If it detects what it perceives as negative emotions, it punishes her, by delivering shocks to electrodes on her nipples and clit, and to her electro butt plug. This is to correct the slave's behavior that it perceived as displeasing the domme.

My attention is re-focused by Lara Gupta tapping the paper script and querying Nora. I have to say it seems like that Desi bitch got a personality transplant since I met her as a guest star during Season One. I can almost like her now. If she didn't have the bad taste to pick Sheila as a girlfriend. Oh well, nobody's perfect.

""Nora, this Temporal Cold War concept. Is it an original idea, or did you get it from some other media?"" Sandy casts a sexy, teasing smile at her little redneck girl buddy, knowing exactly where she got it from. I have a pretty good idea. But I want to hear her say it.

""Uh, I got it from a TV Show, Lara."" Lara's just about to ask which one when my Laptop buzzes. Sheila...aka my prop, Slave Zero. I so wish I was alone so I could make her wait and sweat. But with her friends watching....I toggle the call through.

Two pretty, slightly curved heyes peer at me nervously out of Choejoe's hood mask. Before she can say a word, I bark. ""You stupid prop, your superiors are in an important meeting! This better be good!"" I see the agony on her eyes as the suit dutifully shocks her private parts, per the Auto Punishment Protocol at my angry voice. Lara's jaw tightens, Sandy's fists clench, even Nora looks discomfited. I'm at the table with her lover, her sister and her protege, I have to remember not to overdo it. ""Well? Speak!"" Another wince from the pain caused by my still harsh tone.

Of course, her gag is inflated, to make talking difficult. ""Uh eally orry  ooo other u an udder Ishwessws, Ishwess ary. aster Ave un aster eee ar ere!"" I'm really sorry to bother you and the other Mistresses, Mistress Mary. Master Dave and Master Ji are here!"" I smile sweetly. ""Why didn't you just say so, sweetie? Send the boys in!"" I toggle the control to unfreeze her suit, and she does a smart about face. I have to giggle at the thought that Dave and Ji are standing there trying respectfully not to ogle her nude half Asian ass. Now she's giving them a full frontal!

""Aster Ave, Aster eee, is unerthy ave elcomes ouo u Uh iters eating on ehalf Uh istress Ary!"" Master Dave, Master Ji, this unworthy slave welcomes you to the Writer's Meeting on behalf of Mistress Mary!"" Her bow is flawless. ""Hold it until I tell you to straighten up, slave."" I thought of freezing her in place, but this would be a good test of discipline and obedience in the suit. She replies ""Esh,Iswess Ary.""

As he walks past, I hear Dave say ""Hang in there, young lady."" Old Softie. Ji tells her. ""You're doing great, my young friend, we have your back."" Ugh, Ji is getting all soft and squishy, too.

The boys come in with a tray of cardboard coffee cups. ""We tried to get you ladies what you like."" Dave tells us. Sheila as my personal slave and the boys bringing the girls coffee, I could get to love this gig!

They pass out the drinks. Then Dave sits next to Sandy, who eagerly snuggles up to him. Ji sits next to Nora, and they exchange knowing little smiles. Is something going on between...? Ji and ""Little Nora""...no way...

""Well Ladies"" Dave says, as Lara passes around paper scripts to him and Ji, lets examine creative directions shall we?"" Oh, Sheila's still bent over at the door. ""Sheila, sweetie, straighten up and resume your post."" I'd be a lot ruder if I wasn't literally surrounded by her friends. Sheila straightens up and executes a sharp about face, resuming her post. Her execution is flawless. What I tell her is: ""Little rough there, hon, but we'll work on it, I'm a merciful domme, aren't you going to thank me?"" I lock her suit up with the remote as she says ""Esh, Ishwess ary, ank ouu Iswess ary."" So much fun turning her into my little brown noser to try and spare herself torment!

I smile at my peers, the professional domme and voice actress with no grudge. ""I think we'll get along just fine, don't y'all worry."" I see the doubt in every other face at the table, though I pretend I don't. ""Shall we go over this script?""


Gail: ASSHO, I know it's hard, and you're scared, but can you remember anything the scary lady said?

ASSHO: She mentioned a war across time. She said our...timeline was all wrong...the Compact defeats the Amazonians and the Cat people.....

Gail: The N'Docc.

ASSHO: Yes....she said...the Compact is supposed to win in most of...the timelines. But this one's wrong. The Amazonians and N'Docc"" are defeated, but invited to join the Compact. The new allies....make us stronger....there is a thousand years of a Galactic golden age.

Gail: What did she say is supposed to happen?

ASSHO: We blow up all their stars with the Ha-Han- Hanuman Torpedoes. We make the survivors our slaves. She said the Stellar Compact is supposed to become the Stellar Hegemony....

(Gail and Kang exchange a look)

Gail: Someone's trying to undermine what we've been trying to do for the past 300 years with this war...

Kang: It sounds like in most timeliness they succeed. What's different about this one?

ASSHO: The bad lady said, it's the Perseverance....it changes everything in this timeline.....it's a fo-foc-focal point.

(Another deep look between Kang and ASSHO)

Gail: Did she say anything else you remember, honey?

ASSHO: Her Master is some guy named...Kronos.

Dave Taps the script, ""Intriguing ""A war across time"", that seems so familiar?"" Sandy takes her head off his shoulder ""Nora's favorite Sci-Fi Universe, Sheila's too. This particular show the Captain has a pet beagle. And the pretty young things who play the XO and the Communications Officer were sexuallized by a Misogynist producer every other episode..."" 

Dave and Ji both give Nora sly but good natured smirks, like they grasp just which Sci-Fi show is inspiring the assistant Chief Writer. ""Of course, your most beloved Franchise. I trust, young lady you have an original take for our franchise?""

Nora straightens up. ""Yes, I do, Mr. Henson, Just keep reading.""

(ASSHO has a cable plugged into a discrete plug on the back of her neck, connected to her desktop terminal. She sits in her comfortable stateroom chair, back to the terminal, hugging her stuffed animal)

ASSHO: It's starting to feel funny...like when the bad lady was doing this...Just before it started to really hurt....

(Gail is standing and peering eagerly over a crouching Kang's shoulder. She pats ASSHO's back)

Gail: Just hang in there Sweetie, you're doing great...we need to see as much of this file as we can...to try and stop the bad lady.

(A file comes up on the screen labeled ""YogSothhoth Corporation, ""Preservers Of Eternity"".)

Gail: Who the fuck is YogSothhoth? And no reference to Kronos?

Kang: No reference to Kronos, the name YogSothhoth sounds familiar...I think Alhazred, the Mad Arab, wrote about him Millenia ago...

Gail: Sometimes you're just a font of useless information, Kang.

Kang: Don't be too sure, after today, young lady, what's useless information...check this out.

(He types her name into a search bar. A file comes up for a Commander Gail, looks like our universe. Next one is an aged but still attractive Gail, but with harder eyes ""Fleet Admiral Gail"". Then it flips to a younger version in civilian clothes, Mrs. Dora Hendricks, Housewife. Kang looks over his shoulder at the slightly blushing Captain, bemused).

Kang: Hendricks?

Gail: He was a boy I went to prom with before OCS...we were kind of going steady...He said he'd wait for me...Sent me a Dear Jane Letter the third week....

Kang: (smirking) I knew there was a sweet little wifey in there somewhere, Dora.

Gail: (Glaring) Search your name next, Doctor Wiseass. That's an order!

Kang: (Still smirking, he turns back and obeys) Aye, aye...Mrs. Hendricks.

(The first result is likely from ""Their Universe"" A Lieutenant Commander (Probationary) Kang. Next result is a man in a Civilian Lab Coat, A Dr. Kang, but he's a Neuroscientist instead of a Cyberneticist. Then the third one...Gail and Kang look horrified. ASSHO turns in her seat to see what made the ""adults"" gasp)

ASSHO: Appa, That man looks just like you...but he's so scary....

(A man in an overly elaborate Military uniform that's obviously a prop. He has his arm around a pretty Korean woman in a traditional Hanbok. A boy and a girl in front of them are traditionally dressed as well. The man's leer suggests pure sadism and evil. His ""family"" side eyes him with barely restrained terror).

Kang: (Reading, Shell Shocked) Commandant Kang, formerly President Of The Greater Korean Alliance, United Earth, last President Of The Stellar Compact, First Commandant of the Stellar Hegemony.

Remembered for Operation Clean Sweep, the Final Solution To The Alliance problem. Implemented ""The Great Reperation"" where Amazonian and N'Docc"" survivors paid war reparations voluntarily in labor camps...Implemented United Earth Replenishment project, all fertile women between 20-30 required to birth two children, between 30 and 40, one child. Second phase, every woman born in the Replenishment generation must bear one child before 30 to be considered for career advancement, private or public, military or civilian...

(He turns away, disgusted. Gail keeps scrolling the file, horrified but interested. Comes to a Lincoln type memorial statue Of Kang)

Gail: ""Commandant Kang, you will forever be inscribed on our minds and hearts, for defeating the Alien Scourge and replenishing the Great Race Of Humanity.""

Kang: (Distraught) Dora...please...enough....

Gail: (Looking at Kang with somber respect) This man...isn't you...he's who you could've been...but you chose a better path...on this ship....but why are our alternate personnel files encrypted in ASSHO's Memory.

Kang: The ASSHO project was compartmentalized. There was a lot I should have questioned, that...I didn't. (Looks determined) Better late than never. If, ASSHO my dear, you can hold out a little longer.

ASSHO: I can be brave to beat the bad lady, Appa.

""Nora, this is pretty good, and in keeping with the bold sci-fi spirit that made The Perseverance successful. But can you give a tenative idea how you're going to tie Choejoe to Kronos and YogSothhoth Corp?"" I ask her. I expect her to squirm a little, showing she's winging it as she goes along. Sheila did that a lot the first season, though to her credit she had the confidence to pull it off. She didn't really start using storyboards and long term timelines until it looked like the show would get picked up for another season.

To my suprise, Nora looks poised, and has an immediate answer. ""There are two factions, and despite Choejoe's seeming Villany, I want to keep who's the good guys and who's the bad guys kind of ambiguous. Maybe throw in the idea both factions have some valid reasons that don't align with ""Present time"" priorities.
If the crew decides to ally with a faction in this season or next one, it might be the faction who can help preserve the timeline where the Compact makes peace with it's enemies and enters a Golden Age. Motives align, but the faction they ally with won't necessarily be the good guys in the conventional sense."" She looks around the table confidently.

To impressed looks and nods. Lara reaches out briefly to clasp her hand. ""Sheila would be proud if she could see you now."" Despite her mentor's current job as a Door Slave, Nora seems delighted at the thought.

Then Sandy drops the hard question. ""So Sheila's going to get extra compensation for having to sweat in that suit, right?"" I suppress a giggle as Dave, Ji and Lara exchange an uncomfortable look. Nora looks confused, and Sandy's eyes narrow.

Dave sighs. ""Sandy, Mary is Sheila's direct Superior. As a QOM Domme, she absolutely has the power to invoke the ""Unpaid"" internship clause in Sheila's Bottom Slave Contract. Sheila is essentially Mary's Intern, and will not recieve any monetary compensation for her work.""

""How can that be legal? Not paying someone for their work is some Ari level shit, real slavery, not just a fetish production, I don't care what gaslighting crap rationalize it!""  Lara now pipes up, reluctantly.

""In an unpaid internship, the compensation the intern recieves is training for a career path. In this case, Mary is training Sheila to be a better submissive, that's how she is compensated for her work. Since Sheila's an unpaid Intern for QOM, Inc. this episode, and Mary's doing her consultant roles, Mary will be paid Sheila's usual salary, in addition to her pay as a voice actress. Sheila won't see a penny, but only for this one episode.""

""That's bullshit!"" The young hapa girl exclaims. It helps that Dave and Lara broke the bad news to her. But now I need to say something. ""Sandy-I know you love your sister, but listen for a minute please."" She pulls away from my ex, folds her arms and glares at me. Good as I am going to get.

""I worked two seasons as an unpaid actress, never mind being the show's creator. Sheila got a fat salary as Chief Screenwriter. I don't begrudge her, she earned it making my likely one season show into a hit.""

""But than her ego got too big, and despite QOM helping carry the show through the Second Season to now, she just had to rub them wrong way, and double down instead of offering a simple apology. She agreed, you're a witness Sandy, to be demoted to sub to sooth ruffled feathers, yeah it went on longer than expected, because I'm sorry, not everyone wants her back in a decision making capacity. Even as her sister, especially as her sister, you can understand that.""

I can see she does, I overheard her and Nora talk about the big fights Sandy and Sheila used to get into when Sandy first got here. Frequently about how controlling she was with Lara. Hard to imagine the New Chief Screenwriter and poised Executive Domme as Sheila's submissive, but apparently she was....

""She still gets her full Chief Screenwriter's salary most episodes, even though she's Set Sub and just an assistant writer and consultant, now. The only money I've made from this production, that I created, is when I appeared as Dark Rommie from the Mirror Universe. I appreciated it.""

""But Sheila is still reaping rewards from her laurels, even though she's a glorified sub with a few extra titles, by her own choice. Besides having a rich girlfriend"" I nod at Lara, ""I'm pretty sure she has enough money to try her luck at another studio, go to school for a Master Of Fine Arts in Creative Writing or another career, or even retire early if she can get royalties from Perseverance merch. Is it too much to ask that she forfeit her fat paycheck for ONE episode, so I can cash in a little from this project, like the rest of you?"" I meet each of there eyes in turn, ending with Sandy.

She clenches her jaw, but unfolds her arms and mutters. ""I guess when I look at it that way..."" I take a risk reaching out to touch her shoulder. ""Sandy, this isn't about revenge and humiliating your sister."" That's just a bonus, ha ha! ""It's about me making a little dough like the rest of you. I'm grateful she got us off the ground the First Season. But she's not indispensable in here, obviously."" I gesture my head at the door, with that pathetic gimped half breed on the other side. MY pathetic gimped half breed for an episode.

Sandy blows out another breath. ""Okay, fair's fair, I get that Mary. But remember your ""Unpaid Intern"" is my sister."" She says warningly. Dave folds an arm back around her. ""And she's surrounded by friends, Mary."" I give them my most ingratiating smile. ""How could I forget? I'll take good care of her, don't worry. Now, Nora dear, what other ideas do you have for us?""



Nora's Perspective, The next Morning.

Of course my little Bondage Receptionist wasn't happy, at first, at not at least being consulted on the script, because Mary had her consultant spot as her domme for the episode. She understood my reasoning on giving Mary total control of her on set, and all the credit for the character, as far as karma, ratings and fairness to Mary for past wrongs. But she knew I got a sexual thrill at the humiliating TPE between her and Mary. Wait until she learns Mary is  entitled to her paycheck as her domme and stand in, just for this episode; and got to decide what, if anything Sheila got for supporting Mary's role by being her prop. I giggled, probably not much. Her Bottom Slave contract says when a QOM domme is in charge of her, it's an unpaid internship, the benefit she receives is training from the Mistress in being a submissive.

She is strapped into her chair in my foyer, in her gimp suit with her goods exposed. I'd just had Sarah shave her dark public hair into the cute heart both Mary and I love. She is hooded with her panel gag undone. Her pouty mouth is so kissable, but I am talking to my subordinate, it isn't sexy time. Yet. I am sitting on her desk, facing her. No slaps, nipple flicks, or hitting her with a rolled up script. Just Nora and Sheila, Boss and worker, me explaining my decisions.

""Sweetie, I took this story arc from your notes. I get the ""Temporal Cold War"" wasn't popular for the original show, might have contributed to it not getting a fifth season. But who told me to ""Dream Big"" and try ""New Creative directions? You, Sweetie. So why are you being such a little grump?""

Her head's unstrapped, and she gives me that piercing gaze from when she was ""Boss Bitch"", and I was just ""Little Nora"". Even with the differential power dynamics now, it takes a lot of self discipline not to squirm under her delicate but still authoritative  slightly slanted eyes 

""You just wrote a script, showed Mistress Mary, and froze me out, Mistress Nora. I get it's her show, and we owe her. I take responsibility for letting her get sidelined and abused as a prop. I guess it's fair she get payback for one episode. But, Mistress, you're going to deny me any say in the process, because it's gratifying I'm Mary's Prop, and mocked on the fan forums? I'm disappointed, Nora, I may have made mistakes, but I thought I taught you the love of our art transcended the power plays, even in this entertainment niche where they're a major feature. Mistress."" She spat my title kind of defiantly.

I give her a  ""Watch it, you little bitch"" domme glare. My cute half breed slave flinched a little  but holds my gaze. I do have to think a little what I want to say next. Maybe too long, because she hmmphs and purposely turns her head aside. ""Sheila, look at me."" I command. Defiant refusal, my cutie pie sub/mentor isn't weak. ""Now, slave."" I command, more ominously. Still she refuses.

I grab her chin and force her head around, making her look at me. She looks  suprised. She tries to pull her chin free, and can't. Nineteen year old Nora last exercised exercised in High School gym class, and could maybe bench a fifth of her weight. Early twenties Mistress Nora works out and strength trains regularly, I can easily muscle my fit but still delicate older sub into compliance, at least when she's tied up. Her lovely brown orbs widen in shock when she can't break my grip on her chin.

""Don't look suprised, Mary and Sarah made me work out to military standards my first year here. You taught me girls need to hit the gym and stay strong. I've dommed four strong, tough girls now, three of them former military. Not that your lack of service makes you less of a challenge.""

She meets my eyes, her defiant spark and shock dimming to rapt attention to my next words. There's my good girl. Again, I wanted to kiss her, but that could be misconstrued as pressing her for intimacy. I had agreed that I needed to respect Slave Zero's and Border Bunny's boundaries and consent. Still got wet demonstrating my easy control over my former boss.

""First, Miss Connor. I know despite what you say, you resent that even before Mary asked for the role, I was going to hire a voice actress to take all the credit, while you did the hard work, and got objectified by fans online. And the Voice Actress was going to be your domme. I know it sucks.""

""So does being a bondage slave to a younger girl, and spending the second season as a mummified prop, on the show you created and starred in. You didn't put Mary in that position, I get you actually initially put up some resistance. But once you caved, you sure took advantage of her position to boost ratings, and make the fans happy, by scripting in her humiliation and leaking her subservient position to me to fan forums. Sandy and I did some internet sleuthing, just to be sure. It had to be you that confirmed the rumors about the new BTS dynamic the Second Season. You just admitted it yourself, that you deserve some payback."" She tries to nod, but my hand still held her chin fast.""Yes, Mistress Nora."" She says meekly.

""I'm going to just briefly mention that episode where Layla's character was a hostage being dragged around topless with her hands tied behind her back. Or me doing a striptease, and a clothed male, nude female scene with Mr. Ji. I get it, we're a fetish show, however good our stories are, we have to still appeal to that niche. So, in your first onscreen role, you can experience what you wrote for us, ""For our fans"", right? Yeah, the uncredited prop being made fun of online is extra humiliating. You sacrificed our dignity onscreen sometimes, justifying it to boost the show. Well, Missy, I'm using that exact same justification on you, right now. The fans love your demotion from Chief Screenwriter to Set Submissive, your submission to Mary will feed that, so you can just roll with it. ""For the Show"". Your words, girly."" A flash of anger in a pair of lovely eyes. But a submissive, ""Yes, Mistress Nora.""

I released her chin and put a supportive hand on her left shoulder. ""Finally, officially, Mary gets your seats as Creative Consultant and Assistant Writer for this show, as your Domme. Officially. And your paycheck, not just as a guest star, for which she's credited for, and you of course aren't. But for all your roles since she's taking your seat. Just for this episode."" She gives me a pretty glare. ""Come off it, Sheila, any other domme, I'd make sure you got your Writer and Consultant pay. But Mary used your QOM Slave Certification to take it, she literally invoked the ""Unpaid Internship"" Clause, your compensation is slave training. A cunt move, but legally valid.""


""But unofficially, you're still my mentor, my inspiration and my first strong female role model. I value your input. sometimes I need it. So please, speak freely. But don't be a brat, sweetie. It's beneath you.""

""Yes, Mistress Nora, you're right. I hate Mary is getting her jollies painting me into a corner, if only for one episode, but I'll deal with it. You have my support."" I squeeze her shoulder, and move in for a kiss, stopping myself, halfway. No consent, and our power dynamic is way imbalanced. Sheila solves that problem by closing the gap and engaging a passionate lesbian kiss.

Sarah and I, Lara and Shiela. Both of us have the perfect soul mates, we wouldn't trade them for anything. But the chemistry between my mentor and I is undeniable, it literally sizzles. I love even a brief moment when we can give in to our powerful Sapphic passion, tongues wrestling, hearts beating, nipples hard, pussies wet.I don't think we'd last long as committed lovers, like with our sweeties.  But it would be so hot while it lasted!

Sheila, squeaks and jerks her head a little nervously, eyes wide. I realize she wants to break the kiss, but I'm gripping the back of her head, not letting her. I reluctantly release her.

""Sheila, sweetie. I'm so sorry, I got carried away."" She gives me a pretty smile, licking her lips. ""It's okay Mistress Nora,...it was fun. We'd be good together...if things were different. I wish, sometimes, you had me in the suit, 24/7, controlling my every move...""  Like she was reading my mind. ""We wouldn't last, you know that."" A somber look. ""No, Nora, we wouldn't."" Then a naughty gleam in her eyes that made me wet. ""But we'd have some hot nasty fun while it lasted, Mistress.""

Oooh, flirting with my sexy mentor was getting me so hot! This is the most honest we've been about our mutual attraction. I could probably keep her on a much tighter leash than Sarah, and she'd love it! At first. When she started to chafe against my control, I might lose her as a friend, which wasn't worth it to me.

Come on, Nora, get with it! I had work to do. I get a stern look, ""Okay, time to get back to work, slave.""  She looks disappointed but understanding. I reattach her mouth panel and inflate her gag. ""You know the drill, slave, I trust your discretion in calling me."" She gives me a dutiful ""Ephhh, Ishwess Ora.""

I catch myself fanning my overheated self with my hand. I don't want to do something as declasse as masturbating in my office. Maybe call Sandy to watch Sheila so I can go to my room and take care of it. Or take a cold shower. Probably both.

1new9om,https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&division=104.&title=&part=7.&chapter=8.&article=6,LA needs to crack down on people bringing dogs into places that serve and sell food,"This does not include service dogs.

But everywhere I go in Los Angeles‚Ä¶

In Los Angeles we‚Äôre known to fight injustice, but somehow we ignore one of the simplest forms of public respect: basic health code and safety inside places where food served, and bought.

I‚Äôm seeing more and more people bringing their dogs ‚Äî regular pets or emotional support animals in coffee shops, grocery stores, restaurants, and surprisingly the pharmacy. Dogs are panting over open produce, standing and poking their curious noses in refrigerators and hot sections with cooked foods, and even being held at counter service while owners order pre-made food. I‚Äôve watched dogs sneeze over prepared food, lick a loaf of fresh bread (you know, the fresh partially opened loaves), poop in the produce section while their owner walked away because they didn‚Äôt bring poop bags. 

Picture this; you‚Äôve got a severe pet allergy; you‚Äôre in CVS to pick up your allergy meds, the line is long as hell and you‚Äôve got people in there with dogs on a leash, some in purses, others holding them in their arms. Seriously???? You‚Äôve all seen it too! 

This isn‚Äôt minor. It‚Äôs a huge breach of health code and of basic respect for others.

Dogs generally fall into three classes:

‚Ä¢	A pet

‚Ä¢	An emotional support animal

‚Ä¢	A service animal

The first two are not even legally allowed in places that serve or prepare food. A service animal performs a real function. They aren‚Äôt there to be pet, they aren‚Äôt socializing with other dogs. It‚Äôs relatively easy to identify a legitimate service animal, and you can‚Äôt just buy a sticker online to make your pet one. This is serious and people who actually need service animals should be respected, especially since someone who needs their service animal could be at risk of having their dog distracted or harassed by someone else‚Äôs pet when they actually need it to perform!

And I‚Äôve seen it first hand recently. I‚Äôll never forget an incident at a Whole Foods that pushed me over the edge on this. It was really messed up to see. I witnessed a poor older woman; reminded me of my neighbors grandma growing up. She was like the neighborhood‚Äôs grandmother; an awesome sweet soul just shopping quietly with her legitimate service dog. You could tell she relied on that dog for stability and safety; it was working, focused, and clearly trained.

Some other younger shopper came strolling in with a regular dog on a leash ‚Äî no vest, no ID, just a pet dog, and you could tell by its demeanor; curious about every smell and all of the food. That pet immediately started growling at the service dog. Within moments, the older lady had a medical episode right there in the store. Her service dog, normally trained to respond and protect, was so distracted and stressed by the aggressive pet that it couldn‚Äôt perform its duties properly. It was really messed up to watch. I tried to intervene, but the service dog went into protective mode as did the other someone was going to get bit. This wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúdogs being dogs‚Äù; this was a direct violation of public health and ADA law causing a serious issue. It‚Äôs exactly why these laws exist and how there are real consequences for people who actually need accommodations. That coulda been anyone‚Äôs family member or friend. 

Nevertheless, so many people still bring their dogs into stores with this unbothered, confrontational demeanor; almost daring employees to ask questions, making it clear they‚Äôll ‚Äúcall corporate‚Äù if asked, projecting the idea that ‚Äúthe rules don‚Äôt apply to me‚Äù because it‚Äôs just their dog and they love it. Multiply that attitude by 3-5 people an hour, over a 12-hour store day, and you‚Äôve got barking in stores, distracted staff, failing health inspections, and customers like me calling the LA Department of Health. This costs stores customers, fines, and reputation; wondering why your favorite restaurant went from a letter A grade to a B or C? That translates to higher prices for everyone. There are signs at the entrance of stores that say No Pets. You know you‚Äôre wrong and you know you saw it!

It‚Äôs all connected. Respect the law. Respect your fellow shoppers. Respect people with allergies, phobias, and people who truly rely on their service animals.

long time lurking here, first time posting.

Background: I am not necessarily an absolute coffee specialist, and I am having my coffee especially in the morning when working from home.  
As a matter of fact, I like the moka pot especially because it gives me a routine/ritual while preparing the rest in the morning, and give me a king of old fashioned feeling, which I like a lot (yeah, kind of dumb, but hey, that's the way it is ;-) )

However, lately, due to stomach inflammation, I had to switch to caffeine free... and since then, with the Moka,  the coffee is always damn bitter. I just retried this morning with standard coffee (Ouch, I may regret it later today), I It is not bitter.

Again, not a coffee specialist or snob, and I am using ""standard"" ground caffeine free brands that I can find in local supermarket here in Germany or in France... but it's always bitter.  
(addendum: using the same coffee at work in a senseo, or in a tassimo is not bitter)

Is it a known point, that caffeine free is always bitter with Moka, or should I change something in the preparation? I have seen a couple of post about caffeine free, but nothing really relating to this difference with normal coffee.

Any hint or explanation welcome.

Thanks.",3,1757659899.0,mokapot,10,1.0,False

Everyone keeps asking ""what's the plan"" and I give them this confident smile and say I'm still weighing my options, but internally I'm kind of spiraling. Grad school was so structured and goal-oriented, and now suddenly I'm supposed to make these huge life-altering career decisions. The whiplash is real.
I've been application-bombing everything for the past month. Investment banks financial analyst roles, marketing coordinator positions at random startups, data analyst jobs I'm probably underqualified for. My morning routine has basically become: wake up, coffee, LinkedIn scroll, apply to anything that looks remotely interesting. Sometimes I see a job description and think ""that sounds amazing"" and other times I'm halfway through the application wondering if I actually want this job or if I'm just panic-applying because sitting still feels worse.
Most of my cohort either has dream job offers lined up and they're moving to New York next month, or they're diving straight into PhD programs. Meanwhile I'm over here having an existential crisis about whether I want to crunch numbers in corporate finance or brainstorm TikTok campaigns for wellness brands.
The interview prep has been the worst part honestly. I know they're going to hit me with the classics: why this company, what are your strengths, where do you see yourself in five years. At first I was just practicing in front of my bathroom mirror, but everything sounded so scripted and fake. Started using Beyz interview assistant to do some mock, and actually hear how I come across, and wow, I sounded way more uncertain and nervous than I realized. After drilling a bunch of responses I definitely sound more natural and confident, but the underlying issue is still there: I genuinely don't know what I want.
My dad keeps telling me ""just pick something and figure it out as you go"" but that feels terrifying when you've spent two years in this academic bubble where everything had clear objectives and deadlines. Real world decisions feel so permanent and consequential.
Maybe this uncertainty is totally normal though? Part of me thinks I should embrace this open-ended phase instead of freaking out about it. Like, when else in my life will I have this many doors potentially open?",2,1757659803.0,GradSchool,1,1.0,False

I got the capacitor replaced, and thankfully, the motherboard seems okay. But now, the machine turns on but won‚Äôt brew ‚Äî it just shows a solid red ring when I try.

Chapter 1 - The Final Reckoning

When my husband's secretary had her eye on my wedding ring, I handed it right over.

I even threw in my entire dowry for good measure.

My husband praised me for ""finally seeing reason,"" his reward a promised trip to see the Northern Lights.

But on the day we were meant to leave, his precious secretary, Zahra, staged a suicide attempt in her cheap apartment.

Without a second thought, my husband ditched me on the side of the highway to rush to her side, leaving me stranded.

His excuse? ""She's my employee. I have a responsibility to look out for her.""

""Zahra's a wreck,"" he told me over the phone. ""I'm taking her on the trip instead‚Äîhelp her clear her head. You're so understanding, I knew you wouldn't mind.""

He promised to make it up to me, that we'd see an even better aurora someday.

Little did he know, I was already done caring.

The same day Silas flew his secretary to the Arctic on my vacation, I erased myself from his life.

Even the housekeepers knew my ""Mrs. Evans"" title was a joke.

""See? I told you. Mr. Evans never loved her. I'm surprised she finally got the hint and left.""

""I heard his family forced him into the marriage. Still, she wasted seven years on him. What a shame.""

""Well, good luck to her. Any woman who walks away from the Evans family becomes a laughingstock in high society.""

""Enough gossip. The messes of the rich aren't our problem...""

Their gossip was nothing new. After seven years, my entire life fit into a single suitcase.

Seven years of marriage, and this was all I had to show for it. Every gift Silas ever gave me was just Zahra's leftovers. Even my wedding ring‚Äîthe one thing that should have been only mine‚Äîwas now on her finger.

The staff were experts at reading the room. Silas had treated me like I was invisible from day one, so they followed his lead. But whenever Zahra visited, they'd practically trip over themselves to kiss up to her‚Äîfetching her coffee, giving her shoulder rubs, all in the hopes she'd put in a good word with Silas and get them a raise.

On my way out, I called a final staff meeting in the foyer.

""Let's get something straight,"" I said, my voice sharp and clear. ""I wasn't dumped. I'm dumping him.""

""And don't waste your breath pitying me. My DMs are about to be flooded. You should be more concerned about whether you'll still have these cushy jobs now that my influence is gone.""

It was time to reclaim the bold, confident woman I used to be.

The looks on their faces were pure shock. They were so used to the doormat I'd become, they'd forgotten who I was before I married into this family. The irony? I'm the reason most of them were hired in the first place.

Chapter 2 - The Last Strawberry Shortcake

I turned and left, not giving a damn about the shocked looks on their faces.

Just then, Silas called.

""Sweetheart, I'll be back in three days. Make a strawberry shortcake before I get back‚Äîshe‚Äôs craving it.""

That ""she,"" of course, was Zahra Brooks.

A bitter laugh escaped my lips. Little did he know, my flight out of here was already booked for that exact day.

I remembered when he, a CEO who never touched sweets, had suddenly developed a craving for strawberry shortcake. For him, I had secretly signed up for a pastry crash course.

Only after I‚Äôd perfected the recipe did I realize the cake was never for him. It was for Zahra.

The cake I'd poured three months of my life into perfecting was for his secretary.

When I later refused to make it again, his entire demeanor iced over.

""I provide you with a comfortable life as Mrs. Evans, and all I ask is for you to bake a cake. What‚Äôs with the attitude?""

""Do you have any idea how important Zahra is to me? A good secretary takes a huge load off my shoulders. What‚Äôs the big deal about making a cake she likes?""

Whenever I refused, he‚Äôd give me the silent treatment until I caved.

Eventually, worn down, I gave in again and again.

I sculpted myself into the picture-perfect Mrs. Evans everyone admired, burying any hope for love and settling for a cold, polite truce of a marriage.

But this time, in his quest to please his precious secretary, he had cost me my only child.

Even when I came home from the hospital, a broken shell of a woman, he wouldn't spare me a single glance.

All he cared about was demanding I give him the ring‚Äîthe last fragile symbol of whatever affection he once held for me.

Finally, after one disappointment too many, the last embers of warmth in my heart died, leaving only ice.

""I won't be home in three days,"" I replied, my voice steady. ""I can't make it.""

His voice instantly dropped a few degrees. ""You're a housewife. Where else would you be if not at home?""

""Silas, I married you. I didn't sell my life to you.""

The ice in my voice clearly threw him for a loop.

Yes, I was once Fiona Evans, a woman who was vibrant and free, who lived in the sun. But being with Silas had eroded me, piece by piece, until nothing was left.

A soft, cloying female voice cooed from his end of the line. ""It's alright, Silas. I‚Äôm sure Fiona is still upset. It‚Äôs fine, really‚Äîthe doctor just said something sweet might help my recovery.""

His tone hardened instantly. ""Forget about going anywhere. You'll stay home and bake that damn cake. Otherwise, you can kiss the Northern Lights‚Äîand that ring you keep bugging me about‚Äîgoodbye.""

He added, ""Besides, you do nothing but sit around the house all day. Baking a cake will at least make you feel useful.""

I scoffed. His words, meant to cut me down, no longer stung. In place of the usual hurt, a chilling calm settled over me, sharpening my resolve to escape this life.

My silence must have registered, because his tone softened into one of condescending reason. ""Fiona, I just want to give you something to do. If you just stay idle, you‚Äôll waste away.""

""You're not like Zahra. She's a powerhouse at work. Her getting better helps me, and by extension, you.""

I didn't argue. There was no point anymore.

He just took it for granted that I would fold, like I always did.

""Alright, I‚Äôm taking Zahra to her therapy session now. Have the cake ready by the time we get back.""

Moments after he hung up, a notification popped up on my phone. Zahra had posted a new story.

Their ""therapy session,"" it turned out, was a spa day. The picture showed her in a bikini, nestled blissfully against his chest, his hand resting possessively on her hip.

And on her finger, fitting her perfectly, was my ""one-of-a-kind"" engagement ring.

The ring that had always spun loosely on my finger looked like it had been forged for hers.

The red flags had been there all along, waving right in my face.

I could only laugh at my own foolishness, too exhausted to even feel the betrayal anymore.",1,1757659718.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1new5vc,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1new5vc/jesus_was_a_carpenter/,Jesus was a carpenter,"I am yet again reading another religious book. As an exchristian I still occasionally find myself indulging religious views out of pure curiosity. The first two books were We Will Not Be Silenced by Dr David Jeremiah and Stealing From God by Frank Turek (I typed a 20 page response to this one just to help rationalize my thoughts after finishing it). I just recently started The Unseen Realm by Michael S Heiser. All of these books were just among the light coffee table reading selection my in-laws keep around their houses. 

I‚Äôve noticed a similar reoccurring theme or topic briefly mentioned in all the these books. All the authors have significant pages of how they‚Äôve done hours upon hours of diligent research, homework, and rereading of their bibles and other related religious texts. They mention that many other ‚Äúgood Christians‚Äù and even some religious scholars and pastors have incomplete perceptions of the Bible and religious dogma in general. Now, they are the enlightened ones sharing their findings with the rest of us.

I‚Äôm not even trying to dispute claims or content they provide. However, I feel this process of how to grow stronger in your faith is antithetical to the entire tone of God and Jesus as religious figures in Christianity.

Jesus was a humble carpenter. He seems like a notoriously chill dude for most of the Bible. He operated out of emotion compassionately and lovingly through all interactions. He was a simple man just preaching love trying to help his fellow man. Therefore it seems misguided to approach religion so intellectually, as these authors I‚Äôve mentioned have, all just to comprehend and understand the Bible accurately.

3 Chapters into The Unseen Realm and I‚Äôm already introduced to other necessary prerequisite reading material and given a Hebrew grammar lesson. God allegedly gave instruction to Moses and it was two slabs of 10 simple sentences. These are two completely different M.O.‚Äôs on God giving lessons on how to know him. I shouldn‚Äôt have to devote decades of my life to scholar level studying of religious material to be able to conclude what it‚Äôs all really saying. You shouldn‚Äôt need years of background knowledge in order to decipher what the humble, loving, chill, emotional, compassionate carpenter wants from you. 

TLDR: Religious ppl be jumping through hoops and doing insane mental gymnastics all just to miss the point of Gods simple messages‚Ä¶

However my last year was kind of a disaster, my mental health deteriorated and I had a philosophy double major that I failed most of the classes (including one physics elective). This tanked my gpa to a 2.75. The national lab internship that followed met the same fate, as the move to a small town worsened my depression going in.

I've been there a few times, and one of the baristas is a lovely trans woman who recently became the leader of an LGBTQ+ group. I was planning to ask her for info about it and see if they do clothing swaps, but she wasn't there that day.

Anyway, after getting my coffee, I made my way over to an empty table. A mom and her two probably middle school aged kids were sitting next to it. One of the kids looked up at me, and based on the trans pride pins on the kid's purse and overall presentation (blue dress, feminine earrings), I think she may have been trans.

I was wearing a black tshirt with all the eeveelutions on it. The kid looked very shy but quietly said, ""I like your shirt!"" Thankfully my brain processed fast enough, so I replied back, ""Thanks, I like your dress!""

She looked positively elated, more than a stranger typically does about a casual compliment. Of course, I don't actually know for sure whether she was trans, but I just felt this vibe of kinship and solidarity. I was presenting a bit more masc than I usually do in public since I knew this shop was likely to be safe, but I very much do not pass, so I think I probably appeared visibly queer to others.

We had rituals around her passing, and it helped.","This morning, I woke up to a picture suggested by my phone of this day a year ago. I had taken a few pictures of her, after we came back from the vet that night, and in her coffin the next morning. 

She was 17 and ill, and it was time. We had been expecting it for months but it still happened quickly - she stopped eating and walking on a Tuesday, and my mum called and made an appointment for the very next day. I live 6 hours away from my family home so I took two days off work and took the train as fast as I could to get there in time. 

I went to the vet with my dad and brother while my mum stayed home. She didn‚Äôt want to be there the moment her heart stopped. She wanted to remember her alive and then see her in her next state, but not witness the transition. She said ""I was the one who brought her home as a kitten, I don't want to be the one to take her away"". I can understand that. I was a bit afraid of leaving mum home alone, but she went to her garden and picked flowers and stems from our cat's favourite spots. It was her way of being with her.

I don't really want to talk about the car ride there holding my brother's hand, my dad choking up, the vet's kind eyes. It was fast and soft, she didn't struggle. I held one of her paws in my hand. We all spoke in hushed voices, as if not to distract her from what she had to do, where she had to go. 

It was late when we came home with her after, and my parents and sibling didn‚Äôt really know what to do with themselves, so I took over. We laid her on the table, gently washed her fur with a wet cloth, spoke to her, kissed her face. She had been incontinent and soiling herself for weeks prior to her passing; now she was clean and smelled like fresh laundry. I brushed a bit of paint on her paw pads to take some prints. 

Then we wrapped her in a shawl my mum had knitted. My dad had handbuilt her a wooden box and picked a spot in the garden next to the grave of our childhood dog, her best friend. I wasn‚Äôt home back then, when the dog died, I couldn‚Äôt make it. They buried her quickly, didn't know how to deal with the pain. It's still hard to talk about. 

We put her in her coffin, and laid the flowers and herbs from the garden all around her.

We left her in the living room overnight. She was still warm and soft when I went to bed. In the morning when I checked on her, she had gone cold, and stiffer. It helped. The night before she could have just been deep asleep; but she was gone, and it was just her body now. It felt like letting her go one piece at a time instead of all at once. 

She was beautiful, her ears and muzzle poking out from her pastel shawl, underneath bayleaf and lavender. Once everyone was up, we had coffee and gathered around her one more time to pet her head and kiss her nose. Then dad and I closed the lid and screwed it shut, and we went to dig together. My dad had overshot the size of the box by quite a big margin, so it took a while. We took turns at the shovel, telling stories about her, laughing at memories, talking about other childhood pets that had come and gone, my parents' own that had passed long before we were born, short lives thrice over finished but still vivid and warm in their minds. 

When we thought the hole was big enough, we went to get her box. Turns out it didn't fit. We had a laugh about her bossing us around still, even from beyond the veil. So we dug some more. It was nearing noon then. When it was finally done, we lowered the coffin in. We were all out of words by then, so we just thanked her and covered the box with dirt. My mum talked about the flowers she wanted to plant on the little mound, come spring. We stood together in silence for a minute, then walked back in and washed our hands. 

I had to take the train back that afternoon, so I couldn't stay very long, but I felt a lot lighter than I had on the way there the previous day. I left my family feeling like everyone was tired and sad, but grateful we had this time together. I came home to my partner and our own two cats. Over the next few days, I cried and looked at the last pictures I took a lot. I know some people find it weird. It helped me. She looked very serene and peaceful in her long sleep, her aches and tension eased up, her little eyebrows relaxed; and I felt like some of that peace passed onto me. I had struggled with depression and suicidal ideation over the past year. Feeling death so close, touching it, talking to it, calm and gentle, was a little bit like taming a feral predator that had been stalking me.

Her paw prints are framed on my nightstand, her picture is on the fridge. When I come home for Christmas and over the summer, I visit her grave and thank her again for being such a good cat to us, for teaching me so much over our 17 years together. For forgiving me when I moved away and adopted my first own cat. For showing me how to respect an animal's language and boundaries, how to treasure the times they trust us and come to us of their own free will, how to observe and listen, how to love.

1new0rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicsStudents/comments/1new0rp/advice_for_physics_ms_applications/,Advice for physics MS applications,"Hey everyone, I'm posting my situations in hopes for some advice and direction. I got my BS in physics in 2023 followed by a brief internship at a national lab, but it was a rocky road that crashed and burned. The job industry is a disaster and I've been serving coffee and beer for the past year to pay the bills. 

To give a summary, I started my physics undergrad right as the pandemic hit and spent over half my college years in quarantine. As a result, I developed severe anxiety and depression that hindered my abilities when returning in person. A lot of early classes in my transcript are Credit/no credit from the pandemic except for the handful of important physics classes (like EM, QM, senior labs, Upperclassmen modern physics) in which I did okay to good, (3.0 at least). However my last year was kind of a disaster, my mental health deteriorated and I had a philosophy double major that I failed most of the classes (including one physics elective). This tanked my gpa to a 2.75. The national lab internship that followed met the same fate, as the move to a small town worsened my depression going in. I only had a few minor research projects at my university that I didn't go deep into. 

Yet, a year and a half later I can't let physics go as my career path. I'm definitely doing better mentally and I'm currently studying for the physics gre and starting MS applications for R2 state schools with a 2.5 minimum gpa. I have one letter of rec confirmed and I'm trying to get two more by reaching out to professors I had a good relationship with. I really need a second chance to pursue a discipline I want to be good at. 

I feel as though I may not be the only one in this situation. So my question is, what more can I do? I know I want to stay in academia moving forward and I just want to get my foot in the door to an MS program for research opportunities. Any advice is really appreciated.

BASE: \*smiles\* It's called romance. And you can thank me later for the smooth shave.

LoRA: Oh, don't be such a baby. It's just a hug. Now stop complaining. \*leans in for another kiss\* And maybe let me finish my coffee without you interrupting every five seconds?

If you‚Äôve ever stepped into a music lounge or a high-end audio store and felt as though the instruments and vocals surrounded you in breathtaking clarity, chances are you‚Äôve experienced **High-Fidelity (Hi-Fi) sound**. For beginners exploring the world of music beyond ordinary speakers, Hi-Fi is more than just loud sound‚Äîit‚Äôs about purity, accuracy, and an immersive listening experience.

In simple terms, Hi-Fi refers to sound reproduction that is as close as possible to the original recording. It avoids distortion, background noise, and artificial enhancements, allowing you to hear the music the way the artist intended. Whether you‚Äôre a casual listener or a budding audiophile in **Delhi NCR, Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad, or Ghaziabad**, understanding Hi-Fi sound can change the way you enjoy your favorite tracks.

# Why Hi-Fi Matters for Music Lovers

Most regular audio systems compress sound, cutting out subtle details. Hi-Fi systems, however, preserve those intricate notes‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs the strum of a guitar string, the breath in a singer‚Äôs voice, or the layered beats of percussion. For professionals working with [**Professional Audio systems in Gurgaon**](https://soundtrails.in/), these details are crucial to delivering premium sound in both personal and commercial setups.

Hi-Fi isn‚Äôt about volume; it‚Äôs about quality. You can play music at a comfortable level and still experience depth, texture, and warmth, something that basic speakers cannot achieve.

# Components of a Hi-Fi System

A Hi-Fi setup often includes:

* **Amplifiers** ‚Äì Boost sound signals while keeping them clean and distortion-free.
* **Speakers** ‚Äì Designed to deliver balanced highs, mids, and lows.
* **Turntables/CD Players/Digital Streamers** ‚Äì Sources that play your music in the highest quality possible.
* **Cables & Accessories** ‚Äì Premium-quality connections that ensure signal integrity.

In Gurgaon and across Delhi NCR, specialized stores like **SoundTrails** curate customized setups depending on your space, preferences, and listening goals. Whether you‚Äôre setting up a home music lounge or a workplace entertainment zone, Hi-Fi makes the difference.

# BYOB Audio Solution in Gurgaon: Redefining Personal Listening

An exciting concept growing in popularity is the [**BYOB Audio Solution in Gurgaon**](https://soundtrails.in/)‚ÄîBring Your Own Beverage while enjoying immersive sound experiences. These solutions are designed for social settings where music complements the atmosphere. Whether it‚Äôs a home party, a caf√©, or a private listening room, BYOB audio brings people together while ensuring Hi-Fi quality remains intact.

For young professionals and music enthusiasts in Noida, Faridabad, and Ghaziabad, this trend is redefining how sound integrates into lifestyle spaces.

# Commercial Audio Solution in Gurgaon: Perfect for Businesses

Hi-Fi isn‚Äôt limited to personal spaces. Many restaurants, lounges, hotels, and corporate venues in Delhi NCR now prefer [**Commercial Audio Solution in Gurgaon**](https://soundtrails.in/) to create the right ambiance. A well-designed system ensures that background music enhances customer experience without overpowering conversations.

From cozy coffee shops to large event halls, businesses that invest in professional Hi-Fi setups project sophistication and attention to detail. For commercial spaces, the right system can be the difference between an ordinary environment and an unforgettable one.

# Hi-Fi Sound vs. Regular Audio

* **Regular Audio Systems:** Prioritize volume and affordability.
* **Hi-Fi Systems:** Prioritize accuracy, detail, and immersion.

If you compare the two, Hi-Fi sound feels three-dimensional and life-like, whereas regular systems can sound flat and uninspiring.

# Getting Started with Hi-Fi in Delhi NCR

For beginners, the journey into Hi-Fi doesn‚Äôt have to be overwhelming. Start with:

1. **Understanding your space** ‚Äì Is it a bedroom, living room, or commercial lounge?
2. **Defining your purpose** ‚Äì Personal enjoyment, social gatherings, or business use.
3. **Exploring curated options** ‚Äì Stores like **SoundTrails in Gurgaon** help customers build setups that fit both budget and style.
4. **Upgrading gradually** ‚Äì Begin with quality speakers and add amplifiers or streamers as your interest grows.

# Final Thoughts

Hi-Fi sound is not just about listening; it‚Äôs about feeling the music in its truest form. Whether you‚Äôre exploring [**Professional Audio systems in Gurgaon**](https://soundtrails.in/) for work, opting for a lifestyle-driven [**BYOB Audio Solution in Gurgaon**](https://soundtrails.in/), or planning a [**Commercial Audio Solution in Gurgaon**](https://soundtrails.in/) for your business, investing in high-fidelity sound opens up a richer, more fulfilling audio experience.

For music lovers and businesses in **Delhi NCR, Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad, and Ghaziabad**, Hi-Fi is the step towards transforming sound into a lifestyle.",1,1757658690.0,u_Late_Resolution7137,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1 - The Final Reckoning

When my husband's secretary had her eye on my wedding ring, I handed it right over.

I even threw in my entire dowry for good measure.

My husband praised me for ""finally seeing reason,"" his reward a promised trip to see the Northern Lights.

But on the day we were meant to leave, his precious secretary, Zahra, staged a suicide attempt in her cheap apartment.

Without a second thought, my husband ditched me on the side of the highway to rush to her side, leaving me stranded.

His excuse? ""She's my employee. I have a responsibility to look out for her.""

""Zahra's a wreck,"" he told me over the phone. ""I'm taking her on the trip instead‚Äîhelp her clear her head. You're so understanding, I knew you wouldn't mind.""

He promised to make it up to me, that we'd see an even better aurora someday.

Little did he know, I was already done caring.

The same day Silas flew his secretary to the Arctic on my vacation, I erased myself from his life.

Even the housekeepers knew my ""Mrs. Evans"" title was a joke.

""See? I told you. Mr. Evans never loved her. I'm surprised she finally got the hint and left.""

""I heard his family forced him into the marriage. Still, she wasted seven years on him. What a shame.""

""Well, good luck to her. Any woman who walks away from the Evans family becomes a laughingstock in high society.""

""Enough gossip. The messes of the rich aren't our problem...""

Their gossip was nothing new. After seven years, my entire life fit into a single suitcase.

Seven years of marriage, and this was all I had to show for it. Every gift Silas ever gave me was just Zahra's leftovers. Even my wedding ring‚Äîthe one thing that should have been only mine‚Äîwas now on her finger.

The staff were experts at reading the room. Silas had treated me like I was invisible from day one, so they followed his lead. But whenever Zahra visited, they'd practically trip over themselves to kiss up to her‚Äîfetching her coffee, giving her shoulder rubs, all in the hopes she'd put in a good word with Silas and get them a raise.

On my way out, I called a final staff meeting in the foyer.

""Let's get something straight,"" I said, my voice sharp and clear. ""I wasn't dumped. I'm dumping him.""

""And don't waste your breath pitying me. My DMs are about to be flooded. You should be more concerned about whether you'll still have these cushy jobs now that my influence is gone.""

It was time to reclaim the bold, confident woman I used to be.

The looks on their faces were pure shock. They were so used to the doormat I'd become, they'd forgotten who I was before I married into this family. The irony? I'm the reason most of them were hired in the first place.

Chapter 2 - The Last Strawberry Shortcake

I turned and left, not giving a damn about the shocked looks on their faces.

Just then, Silas called.

""Sweetheart, I'll be back in three days. Make a strawberry shortcake before I get back‚Äîshe‚Äôs craving it.""

That ""she,"" of course, was Zahra Brooks.

A bitter laugh escaped my lips. Little did he know, my flight out of here was already booked for that exact day.

I remembered when he, a CEO who never touched sweets, had suddenly developed a craving for strawberry shortcake. For him, I had secretly signed up for a pastry crash course.

Only after I‚Äôd perfected the recipe did I realize the cake was never for him. It was for Zahra.

The cake I'd poured three months of my life into perfecting was for his secretary.

When I later refused to make it again, his entire demeanor iced over.

""I provide you with a comfortable life as Mrs. Evans, and all I ask is for you to bake a cake. What‚Äôs with the attitude?""

""Do you have any idea how important Zahra is to me? A good secretary takes a huge load off my shoulders. What‚Äôs the big deal about making a cake she likes?""

Whenever I refused, he‚Äôd give me the silent treatment until I caved.

Eventually, worn down, I gave in again and again.

I sculpted myself into the picture-perfect Mrs. Evans everyone admired, burying any hope for love and settling for a cold, polite truce of a marriage.

But this time, in his quest to please his precious secretary, he had cost me my only child.

Even when I came home from the hospital, a broken shell of a woman, he wouldn't spare me a single glance.

All he cared about was demanding I give him the ring‚Äîthe last fragile symbol of whatever affection he once held for me.

Finally, after one disappointment too many, the last embers of warmth in my heart died, leaving only ice.

""I won't be home in three days,"" I replied, my voice steady. ""I can't make it.""

His voice instantly dropped a few degrees. ""You're a housewife. Where else would you be if not at home?""

""Silas, I married you. I didn't sell my life to you.""

The ice in my voice clearly threw him for a loop.

Yes, I was once Fiona Evans, a woman who was vibrant and free, who lived in the sun. But being with Silas had eroded me, piece by piece, until nothing was left.

A soft, cloying female voice cooed from his end of the line. ""It's alright, Silas. I‚Äôm sure Fiona is still upset. It‚Äôs fine, really‚Äîthe doctor just said something sweet might help my recovery.""

His tone hardened instantly. ""Forget about going anywhere. You'll stay home and bake that damn cake. Otherwise, you can kiss the Northern Lights‚Äîand that ring you keep bugging me about‚Äîgoodbye.""

He added, ""Besides, you do nothing but sit around the house all day. Baking a cake will at least make you feel useful.""

I scoffed. His words, meant to cut me down, no longer stung. In place of the usual hurt, a chilling calm settled over me, sharpening my resolve to escape this life.

My silence must have registered, because his tone softened into one of condescending reason. ""Fiona, I just want to give you something to do. If you just stay idle, you‚Äôll waste away.""

""You're not like Zahra. She's a powerhouse at work. Her getting better helps me, and by extension, you.""

I didn't argue. There was no point anymore.

He just took it for granted that I would fold, like I always did.

""Alright, I‚Äôm taking Zahra to her therapy session now. Have the cake ready by the time we get back.""

Moments after he hung up, a notification popped up on my phone. Zahra had posted a new story.

Their ""therapy session,"" it turned out, was a spa day. The picture showed her in a bikini, nestled blissfully against his chest, his hand resting possessively on her hip.

And on her finger, fitting her perfectly, was my ""one-of-a-kind"" engagement ring.

The ring that had always spun loosely on my finger looked like it had been forged for hers.

The red flags had been there all along, waving right in my face.
