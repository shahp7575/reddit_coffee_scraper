I’m a 30-something professional who works from home, and I don’t have family or an established social circle in Madison. I’ve lived here for a few years, but between finishing school, job searching, and getting settled into my career, I haven’t really had time or taken the effort to build a community until now.

I am hoping to make friends and get more connected in the community. A lot of the advice I’ve seen is to “put yourself out there,” and this is one of my attempts to put myself out there.

Are there any groups for remote workers or working professionals who meet up for lunch, coffee, or casual social events? Or any professional/ networking groups that you would recommend? (I do occassionally find events on [Meetup.com](http://Meetup.com) but have not been able to establish any social relationships yet.)

My interests include fashion, art, and reading/book clubs, but I am pretty open to other types of activities. I am just a bit intimidated by highly competitive or athletic group activities (like team sports or run clubs), so something more relaxed would be great.",1,1763309499.0,madisonwi,0,1.0,False

1oyplkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1oyplkf/is_smart_plugs_compatible_with_google_home/,Is smart plugs compatible with Google Home?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been getting this question a lot from friends and family - can you actually use smart plugs with Google Home? The short answer is yes, and honestly, it's changed how I control stuff around my house.

Let me break this down for anyone who's confused about compatibility.

**What You Need to Know About Smart Plug Compatibility**

Most smart plugs these days work perfectly fine with Google Home. The key thing is making sure the plug you're buying specifically says it's compatible with Google Assistant. I learned this the hard way when I bought a random cheap one that only worked with Alexa.

The setup is usually pretty straightforward. You plug it in, download the manufacturer's app, connect it to your WiFi, and then link it to your Google Home app. After that, you can control whatever's plugged in just by talking to Google. I use mine for lamps, fans, and even my coffee maker.

**Voice Commands That Actually Work**

Once everything's connected, you can say stuff like ""Hey Google, turn on the living room lamp"" or ""turn off the bedroom fan."" You can also set schedules and routines. I have my lights turn on automatically at sunset, which is honestly pretty cool.

The wireless smart plugs I'm using now have been solid for over a year. No random disconnections or weird glitches like my old ones had.

**Things to Consider Before Buying**

Look for plugs that support 2.4GHz WiFi since that's what most smart home devices use. Some newer routers only broadcast on 5GHz, which can cause problems. Also, check the wattage rating - you don't want to overload them with high-power appliances.

If you're looking to grab some reliable options, I put together a page with the smart plugs that actually work well with Google Home and have good reviews. You can [check them out here](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) - they're all Amazon listings so you know you're getting legit products with buyer protection.

**My Honest Take**

Smart home automation doesn't have to be complicated or expensive. Smart plugs are literally the easiest way to start. They're affordable, easy to install, and you can control old ""dumb"" devices with just your voice.

I've tried maybe six different brands at this point, and yeah, some are definitely better than others. The ones that connect through Google Home without needing ten different apps are the winners in my book.

If you're still on the fence, [here's that link again](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) where you can compare different options and read what other people are saying about them.

Bottom line - Google Home and smart plugs work great together. Just make sure you're buying something that clearly states Google Assistant compatibility on the box, and you'll be good to go.

I’ve made a few posts before about wanting to meet people, and every time someone reached out, it reminded me how many of us are looking for the same thing. I’m 26F, still new pretty to the area — and honestly, I’m also hoping to find friends to share the little things with.

I've realized how hard it can be to meet people once you grow up but how amazing is to have people and someone to call friend to share stories with, laugh or even just talk to on a day when everything feels heavy or just go for a walk ♡.

With the holidays getting closer, it finally felt like the right moment to start this small group I’ve been talking about — something cozy and simple for anyone in their mid-20s to mid-30s (but truly, everyone is welcome) who wants a bit more connection as the holiday and winter starts.

Nothing big or formal, just things like:
✨ Holiday baking or cooking
✨ Movie nights or board game nights
✨ Gift exchanges
✨ Crafts, coffee, or winter walks
✨ Or simply talking when someone needs company

I’ve already reached out to the people who commented or messaged me on previous posts, but I wanted to make one last post in case I missed someone or there’s anyone new who would like to join before I put everything together.

If you’d like to be part of the group — or even if you’re just looking for a friend to talk to — feel free to drop a comment or DM me. I’ll be gathering everyone this week so we can all be added in at the same time.

Here’s to making this winter a little softer, a little brighter, and a little less lonely together 💛🎁",3,1763309305.0,IowaCity,0,1.0,False

I woke up Sunday morning, still wearing a smile from last night. My wife was already up, downstairs in the kitchen. I let the dogs out, came up behind her, hugged her, and started to kiss the back of her neck. Not to start anything, just as a good morning. She turned around and basically backed me up against the counter, telling me that I had ""a job to do."" I performed said job to her satisfaction, I hope.

She then said that she wanted blueberry pancakes for breakfast. She started mixing the batter and I got out the cast iron. We worked together in our tiny kitchen, had a great breakfast, and talked over coffee. After I walk the dogs, we are making cinnamon rolls together. I am a bit worried about that. I am not what anyone would call a baker.

Next week is our 33rd wedding anniversary. We have been together for over 35. Everything is just so easy together. It is like we know each other's minds and can communicate just by a touch.

1oypdqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1oypdqg/my_sister_hit_my_mother_i_cant_force_myself_to/,My sister hit my mother. I can't force myself to care anymore!,"My Father died 30 years ago. We are 4 kids ( all women, youngest being 32 now ), and my mother never remarried. 

My father left inherentence that my mother refuses to share until now. My mother was my hero, until I grew up enough to understand that, for her, I was only an investment. I had years of therapy to overcome her abuse. 2 of my sisters have the same issues as me. 
Other sister, however, is a copy of my mother. She got married at 17. She cheated on her husband ( he cheated too). She divorced a couple years ago with 2 kids, went back to live with mom, and refuses to work. She does a bit of 'covered prostitution ' out of pleasure and not need. She manipulates the three sisters to give her money pretending her kids are sick ... 
She lives rent free with child support, prostitution, theft, and basically the only one that forced mother to share the proceedings with inheritance with her. 

A couple weeks ago, we went to an event in another city, about 9 hrs drive.we spent I nice week. I really did my best to organize everything and calm the nerves of everybody.
On the drive back, I was with my husband and niece in one car, my mother and sister is the other. Their car was behind us.  
After about 2 hours of driving , their car car stopped suddenly. I went to check on them and mom had her glasses broken. She told me my sister hit her. I begged to of them to switch to the other car. I tried to have them stop for coffee or a meal to breath. I begged them to even just turn on the f* radio. They were adamant neither wanted to switch cars and asked me to go. 
Afterwards I stopped in a sightseeing area, begged them to get out of their car and f* breath. Of course they did not want it. I asked them not to fight in front of my husband since I know how ugly they get, and they looooooove making a show. They agreed.

About 20 minutes before arriving finally, mom doubled us and stopped the car abruptly, in the middle of the road. We could already see that they were pulling each other's hair. My husband went out of the car before I could even react. I went out too. They were pulling each other's hair, insulting each other and telling stories each one of the other to say basically they are both f* prostitues. 
Of course since my husband was trying to separate them from each other, they were telling him the wooorst stories about themselves.
 It took about 30 minutes at least to separate them. 
Mom came with me while sister went with my husband. 
When mom was in my car, I just did not say a word. Honestly, if my niece wasn't in the back, I might have made a very bad decision. She kept talking and talking and talking. I turned on the radio volume, she lowered it down, and turn it on again and gave her a look that she better not medd with me right now. 
My husband told me that my sister told him all about how mother is a prostitute and bitch basically. 
Upon arrival to their house, I went up to take my last belongings ( some gold necklaces I left in mother's safe) husband came with me to put a bag they had in our car. They started talking to him, asking him about his opinion.... Like wtf ??? I asked him to wait for me in the car. 
Once I finished and went to the car, while I was just going to block them, mom called him to ask :"" is it true you said you don't like meee ""
I told her to not call him again and hang up. 


All of this, it was to force my hand to buy out my sister so mom could have the house and inheritance to herself....... ! She tried to make the drama last year, my sister too, I told them to basically fuck off and they already stole so much from me, I won't give any of them a cent. 
Now they thought, the only way to calm them down is for my sister to leave, so she needs money. They wanted to include my husband and moderator to extort him, and I'd be too ashamed to say no. 

I truly hate them... Seriously. It's not rage that I feel, it's disgust. 
Of course I'm cutting them off of my life. The only part that still hangs is that I know I should not accept a situation where and elderly gets beaten up. But I know it was a f* show for my husband. And honestly, I f* don't care.

Then all of a sudden Erin is acting like a street detective taking down coke dealers - WTF? And after a huge build up to running for DA she just quits? And her off and on with ex-hubbie Boyle made me nauseous.

Danny stayed true taking down, cartels, gun runners, serial killers with massive body drops. Baez was a great partner.

TBH Frank became boring. He had some good storyline but there wasn't a person's personal life he wouldn't meddle with. Many times when he summoned a beat cops and shouted his heavy handed morality I would think, ""Just quit. And tell this pompous git to fuck off.""

Finally, Abigail was the most screwed over character on the show. A very capable cop and detective when allowed to show it, she was pigeon-holed by mysoginistic Frank as a coffee pourer and coat holder. 

She should have got the spinoff as a Leutenant, squad leader, detective. Finally escaping ""duty"" and wasting her skills and talent as a pseudo-wife/work-wife for Frank.",5,1763308402.0,bluebloods,0,0.86,False

I have two big dogs. Theyre both girls, I think one is around the age of 5 and the other is 6. The oldest is a great dane mixed with something else, and the youngest is a German shepherd mixed with something else. I can't remember what their other breeds are.

I told my dad a few days ago that they needed more dog food (the bag was almost empty and I could barely scoop food into it) and he said he'll get some. We have a whiteboard shopping list in our kitchen where me and my brother can write down whatever we need, so I wrote down dog food.

The next following days, they were completely out of food. I found out that they had stolen bread off the counter and eaten that. I was kind of annoyed because we just got that bread, but I understood since they didn't have anything else to eat.

Today, I told my older brother that they were out of food, still. He was surprised that my dad hadn't ordered any dog food even though I told him and had written it down, so my brother said that hes going to go get dog food before work.

After I woke up, I saw that they got into this caffeine powder stuff that (I think) makes your coffee stronger. They fortunately didn't open the bag, so I put it away and dumped out their treats into a bowl and let them eat those. They were wagging at me when they were done, but kept coming up to me and nudging the food bowl.

These two squads faced each other just last month and racked up a 64 point total; I imagine today’s game will land on a similar high-score. Cincinnati’s last 3 straight games have finished at over 60 points (seriously…) and until they can get their defense to actually start defending, I imagine that’s a trend that will continue. As for Pittsburgh, they’ve allowed at least 20 points in their last 4 straight outings. My money’s on the Over to cash comfortably here, friends.

1oyp0zx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1oyp0zx/duloxetine_bupropion_for_adhd_anxiety_and_little/,"Duloxetine & bupropion for ADHD, anxiety, and little bit of depression","Hi everyone, I’d like to ask people who have taken duloxetine and bupropion together about their experience. Did it help you? How did you feel on this combination?

I was diagnosed with depression a few months ago. I took escitalopram for a few months, but it made me feel worse. Then I tried duloxetine for a month, but since I’m quite opposed to taking medication, I decided to stop. I actually feel a bit better now, maybe still slightly depressed, but nothing like when I was first diagnosed.

In the meantime, I was diagnosed with severe ADHD, which finally makes sense considering how my life has gone so far. I’m almost certain that stimulants won’t work well for me. Even a lot of coffee makes me shaky, and my past experience with amphetamines was far from calming, quite the opposite.

Now I really want to treat my ADHD because I can’t keep living like this, I feel miserable. My psychiatrist gave me a plan: for the first two weeks I’ll take duloxetine, since I have some anxiety and she’s worried bupropion might increase it. Then after two weeks I’ll start 150 mg of bupropion. She also mentioned that if things go well after two to four months, we might add atomoxetine, but first I need to do heart and thyroid tests.

I’m a 35-year-old

1oyozw9,https://i.redd.it/47vsjch14n1g1.jpeg,Nuria / Ara the Sea Demon 🌑,"🌑 Nuria Sikunei — The Regerade Shadow Queen of Guraviance Kingdom
Full Name: Nuria Sikunei
Age: 30
Birthday: January 21, 1954
Race: Shadow Demon / Japanese
Role: The Regerade Shadow Queen of 
Guraviance Kingdom / Higher-Rank Demon
Alignment: Antagonist / Villain
Residence: Guraviance Kingdom, located on a distant island near Japan

🖤 Personality

Nuria is calm, mysterious, and harsh, carrying a soothing voice that somehow makes others afraid when she speaks. She acts superior, hates humans, and fights with overwhelming power. She has strong battle IQ and remains composed in nearly all situations. Due to her demon heritage, she is weak to steel.

🍽️ Food & Drinks

Ice coffee, blood, shrimp pasta, opera cake, deep-fried fish, cucumbers, toast, strawberry pudding, and chicken curry salad.

⚔️ Powers & Abilities

Spike Trap
She shoots shadows that form traps around opponents. If an opponent attacks the spike trap, it weakens them from the inside. Although escape is possible, their energy will drain the longer they strike or stay within it.

Mind Calm
By calming her mind, she can dodge attacks, counter powers, avoid tricks, and block heavy or special moves with eerie precision.

Shadow Imagery
Nuria can copy her opponent’s powers, mimic their movements, and replicate their technique with even greater strength, sometimes making her copied version more powerful than the original.

Max Regeneration
She regenerates extremely fast. If she consumes blood, this regeneration becomes even faster. Speed also boosts her healing rate, letting her restore energy and wounds simultaneously.

Shadow Blood Absorb
She releases massive shadows that strike opponents and extract their blood. The absorbed blood returns to her, strengthening her powers and weakening her opponent drastically.

Shadow Swing
She shoots a powerful shadow that grabs her opponent and swings them relentlessly. This reduces their speed and can even break their healing or regeneration abilities.

Shadow Attacks
Her signature shadow ability allows her to:
* Block far-range or close-range attacks,
* Stab opponents and paralyze them for long periods,
* Inflict devastating pain throughout the body,
* Strike rapidly as if teleporting,
* Cause large-scale destruction,
* Erase opponents from existence through shadow destruction.

Dark Gareyan (Special Move)
This is her ultimate dark ability. It allows her to:
* Unleash massive dark blasts that cause bleeding,
* Create sharp spikes from the ground that heavily damage the body,
* Inflict internal suffering through cursed effects,
* Bend and reshape landscapes into ocean lands, ice lands, fire lands, or shadow lands,
* Use the terrain change to overwhelm and defeat opponents.This attack never misses.

🤝 Relationships

Farris – Great Relationship
Nuria sees Farris as her most loyal servant. She cares about him deeply and treats him exceptionally well. She enjoys walking with him, feeling almost amused and genuinely connected to him.

Tomo – Good Relationship
She views Tomo as a free-spirited demon and never feels anger toward him. His childlike instincts interest her, and she often lets him sit beside her peacefully, almost like a demonic parent figure.

Shi – Good Friendship
Nuria respects Shi as a cooperative ally and acknowledges Shi’s wisdom. She speaks to her like a true friend, though Nuria secretly dislikes how strong Shi is compared to her.

Ara – Neutral
Nuria sees Ara as a good-hearted demon who avoids drinking blood. She views Ara as a potential threat because Ara protects those she loves and teams up with humans. This anger fuels Nuria’s distrust.

Rayku – Hate
Nuria despises Rayku for hunting demons, including herself. She hides her anger behind calmness to avoid going berserk, but she feels no sympathy and desires to destroy him for his human strength and actions.

🌑 Summary Overview

Nuria Sikunei is the Regerade Shadow Queen of the Guraviance Kingdom and one of the main antagonists of the Ara the Sea Demon universe. As one of the strongest Higher-Rank Demons in Japan, her vision is to create an empire where demons rule and humans no longer exist. She seeks to build a grand demon kingdom and destroy any humans who try to stop her, driven by what demon hunters took from her bloodline in the past.
Her shadow-based abilities make her extremely dangerous, capable of fighting equally well during the day or at night. She believes demons should be stronger than humans and wants to reshape the world into a demon-dominated society. Any demon who allies with humans is marked for destruction without mercy.
Because of her ruthless will, devastating power, and merciless ambition, she is feared and known as the Shadow Demon of the Guraviance Kingdom.

Thanks for your time to read my short novel:

I am in search for a electric grinder to get into making Espresso myself and not letting the automatic Machine do it. 

I am going to get gifted a Sage (Breville) Bambino for Christmas and I am relatively space constrained since there will be a need for the other, automatic coffee maker to be on the counter for the other people. I could live with putting away the grinder into a cupboard so I could live with a bigger option.

I do not like the Espresso through it so **I tend to drink more Cappuccino, Latte Macchiato or Flat Whites**. But I'm super open into getting more into the Espresso itself too. I will continue to drink mainly dairy mix drinks with it.

I am going to buy the Grinder myself so I researched into my options.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_

I have discounts through family working at Sage so that was the only thing I looked into:  
\- Sage Smart Grinder Pro: 165€  
\- Sage Dose Control Pro 150€  
Both of the Grinders seem to be a decade old and the state of the art seem to have changed (According to YouTube). 

It would be great to stay at this price range. 

When watching YouTube Videos I saw thousand different opinions so I am wondering what other options would be better at the same price point? I really can't get my head around the options and seeing/understanding the pros and cons of the options in the videos :D

  
I could, in the worst case, stretch the budget to 200€ish but if I can stay at the price of the Sage options I'd be super happy!

  
Generally: If you have any other ideas that would stray around my own ideas or inputs I am still open to listen to it and to change it. I am not sold on anything right now! :) ",1,1763307973.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

suffered too much these past months...

my name is Sophia, 27, and six months ago, was so burned out I couldn't remember the last time I felt like myself

started growing my Instagram in Jan 2025, it was just a fashion and lifestyle account

posted outfit ideas, coffee shop reviews, some travel content when I could afford it

fell in love with the whole content creation process

like I finally found my thing

and yes, blocked all my friends and family from seeing it

was so much hate from their side

always wanted to build something on my own without people I knew feeling obligated to follow or like my stuff

by March I had 247 followers

then I got stuck

for nine months, I was trapped between 230 and 250 followers

I'd gain 20, lose 15

was psychologically so hard for me, almost lost myself

did everything the ""experts"" told me to do

posted Reels every single day 

used trending audio

replied to every comment within the first hour (when i had some)

engaged with other accounts for 90 minutes every morning before work

analyzed my insights daily

then bought two different courses, one for $297 about ""algorithm hacks"" and another for $999 about ""viral content formulas""

and nothing worked, 

was waking up at 5:30am to film content before my marketing job started at 9am

spent my lunch break editing in the bathroom stall because I didn't want my coworkers to see

always posted at ""optimal times"", which meant interrupting dinner with friends to add some hashtags and then refreshing to see if anyone engaged in the first five minutes

weekends? I didn't have weekends anymore

six hours on Saturday creating a week's worth of Reels, another four on Sunday planning captions and engaging with other accounts because that's what you're supposed to do if you wanna grow

my ex-boyfriend (yeah, ex now) asked me in June if I even liked doing this anymore

snapped at him, like, actually yelled, over a question

he didn't believe in what I was doing

kept saying I was wasting my time, that I should just get a ""real"" side hustle

on every post, he’d comment smth like ""still at 300 followers?"" even while I was filming more content

we broke up in early July

cried so much over him, as I really liked him

we’d been together for seven whole years, since we were marketing students in college, but apparently he got a new girlfriend

my best friend, Jane, and yeah his coworker

all while I was at the studio shooting Reels like an idiot, thinking everything was fine

he said I was choosing Instagram over our relationship and that I didn’t spend time with him

lost the love of my life ’cause I was busy chasing dreams

was stuck in this horrible loop of working harder and harder on completely useless things

life stopped making sense at that point...

but somehow I kept showing up on Instagram, growing bit by bit

and this is the thing they don't tell you about chasing Instagram growth, It feels like drowning while everyone around you says ""just keep swimming."" 

exhausted, not moving forward

and the only advice anyone gives you is to post more, engage more, work harder.

the panic attacks started in July. Real ones, the kind where you genuinely think you're dying

your chest tightens, can't breathe, hands go numb, and your brain is screaming that something is catastrophically wrong

one hit me right before I was supposed to film a Reel about ""summer fashion essentials"" 

was standing in my bedroom, holding a sundress, full makeup on, ring light set up

and I just... broke

why am I even alive? 

do I really need all this pain? 

why is God testing me so hard?

I slid down the wall and sat on my floor crying for thirty minutes

phone kept buzzing with Instagram notifications and I wanted to throw it out the window

that night, I called my best friend Alexis sobbing

told her I was done, was gonna delete the whole account and pretend the last year and a half never happened. period

we FaceTimed for four whole hours

she let me cry and then said something that genuinely changed everything

""Soph, dear, you need to stop doing what you're doing, for the love of God, please""

she's a content creator too, but she'd somehow grown to 67k followers in less time than I'd been stuck at 300

I'd been too embarrassed to ask her how

too proud

too scared she'd think I was using her

""I'm not telling you to quit"" she said, ""but telling you that you're working insanely hard on the wrong things, dear""

I didn't get it

she explained it like this

I was spending 90% of my time creating content and maybe 10% of my time actually understanding what content works

was guessing, copying trends three weeks after they peaked

was posting what I *thought* people wanted instead of what the data showed they actually engaged with

""There's this website I started using like five months ago,"" she said

she sounded weird about it, almost hesitant

like she didn't wanna seem like she was trying to sell me something or gatekeep information

""It's called Clyren, specifically for Instagram creators. It basically scans what's actually going viral in your niche right now, real-time, and tells you what to make.""

I was so skeptical

but I'd already wasted $1,296 on courses that promised ""algorithm secrets"" and ""viral formulas"" 

tried every scheduling app, used analytics tools that just showed me pretty graphs without telling me what any of it meant

""Is it another course?"" I asked

my voice probably sounded dead

""No. It's like... it tells you what's working right now in your specific niche, and then it helps you create your version of it. It's saved me probably 15 hours a week.""

fifteen hours a week, holy moly

I thought about my 5:30am wake-ups, my bathroom stall editing sessions, ruined weekends, my panic attacks, the relationship I lost

all that time dedicated to completely useless things  

""Aaand, how much is it?""

she told me it wasn't so cheap, but it wasn't another $999 course either, was a monthly subscription

I signed up that night

July 14th, 2025

I remember the date because it felt like a last-ditch effort

like, if this doesn't work, I'm actually done, for real

I'm not gonna lie to you and say it was instant magic

the first week, I barely understood how to use it, the interface shows you trending content in your niche, breaks down why it's performing well, and gives you frameworks to create your own version

but I felt stupid

kept second-guessing everything

""Is this actually good advice or am I being scammed again?""

then something clicked

the tool showed me that fashion Reels about ""quiet luxury"" and ""capsule wardrobes"" were absolutely exploding in my niche

small accounts were getting 500k+ views on this specific type of content

been posting ""outfit of the day"" content because that's what I thought fashion creators were supposed to do

I made one Reel about building a capsule wardrobe with 10 pieces, used the exact format Clyren showed was working, the ""show the pieces individually, then show 7 different outfit combinations"" structure

posted it on a Tuesday at 6pm

wednesday morning, I woke up to 340,000 views, holy sh...

not exaggerating, 340k

I sat on my bed staring at my phone for like ten minutes, then started crying

called immediately Alexis and couldn't even speak for the first minute

2,847 new followers from that one video

in 3 holy days

spent nine months trying to get past 350 followers total and I just gained almost 3,000 from one 37-second video, damn

my account went from 312 followers to over 3,000 in 72 hours

still can't fully believe it

then, I posted 3 more Reels that week using the same framework, trends that were actively working right now

every single one got over 200k views

every single one

by the end of July, I hit 18,000 followers

August? 47,000

September? I broke 100,000

literally screamed when I saw it

called Alexis at like 11pm freaking out

today, November 2025, I'm at 108,294 followers.

but, here's what matters way more than these numbers

working on my Instagram maybe 8 hours a week now, not 30 anymore, and yeah, the results :)

I don't wake up at 5:30am anymore, I film content on Sunday afternoons while drinking coffee and listening to music, don't edit in bathroom stalls, and don't have panic attacks about posting times

actually have a life again, somehow

I just... got my life back

and I'm making actual money now

two weeks ago, got my first real brand deal, $3,200 for 3 posts

literally cried when I saw the contract, and I'm in talks with two other brands right now, one offering $7K

and, haha, saw my ex these days 

he asked how the ""Instagram thing"" was going, I told him about the brand deals and the growth

he didn't really know what to say 😆

and I'm seeing someone new now

he's actually supportive, gets it, doesn't make me feel stupid for building something

last weekend, we went hiking and I didn't think about Instagram once, at all

thanks God I'm sleeping again

my therapist (yeah, I started therapy in August) said I seem like a completely different person than I was five months ago

so why am I writing this ?

because I keep seeing posts in this subreddit from people who sound exactly like I did six months ago

burned out, stuck, working themselves to death and getting nowhere, buying courses that teach the same recycled BS

and I wanna scream at my screen like ""stop, it doesn't need to be this hard""

because that's the thing, it doesn't need to be this hard

I dedicated so much time to completely useless things

engaging with random accounts for hours, posting at ""perfect times"" that didn't matter, using trending sounds from three weeks ago when they were already dead, analyzing insights that told me nothing actionable

I lost a relationship over it, had panic attacks, worked 30+ hours a week on content that got me nowhere

it doesn't need to be this hard

it didn't need to be like that

I'm not saying Clyren is the only answer, just saying the problem isn't that you're not working hard enough

the problem is you're working hard on the wrong shit

you can't outwork bad strategy

you can't hustle your way past content that doesn't match what people actually wanna see

and you definitely can't succeed by copying trends after they're already dead

I wasted nine months doing exactly that

what changed for me was having real data about what was working right now, to understand why content performed well, and have an actual system instead of just guessing and praying

If you're where I was six months ago, exhausted, stuck, wondering if you should just delete everything and give up, I'm telling you what I wish someone had told me back then

stop guessing and stop working 30 hours a week on content that doesn't move the needle, please stop

get data, get a system that works for you 

and, get your life back

I don't know if this post breaks any self-promotion rules

if it does, I'm so sorry, not trying to sell anything to you

I don't get paid if you check out Clyren .com

I'm just so tired of watching people burn out the way I did when there's genuinely a better way

here's not an affiliate link or whatever

I don't benefit from you knowing about it, just telling you what worked for me

wish someone had told me sooner, and maybe you need to hear this too

and, if you're reading this at 4am because ur anxious about your account and your content and whether you're wasting your time... 

I see you, and I believe in you

keep going, please

for me, make me proud, I will support you with anything

because I was you six months ago, and I know how it is

it gets better, I promise

you just have to stop doing what's not working

kiss you, love, so blessed for all I achieved past months

life's really cute, just keep doing 🫶

1oyowu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1oyowu4/how_to_be_productive_when_you_feel_dead_inside_a/,How to be productive when you feel dead inside: a realistic guide for the chronically depressed,"Let’s be real. The internet is full of productivity advice that assumes you’re already at 70% capacity. Wake up at 5AM. Journal. Crushing deep work sprints. All great... if you’re not stuck in bed staring at the ceiling feeling nothing. 

If you live with depression, most ""productivity hacks"" feel like listening to someone tell you to run a marathon with a broken leg. You already know you should be doing things. You're just too tired, numb, or paralyzed to start. And TikTok wellness bros shouting “just go to the gym!” don’t help. They mean well. But they don’t get it.

This post is for people who need something different. Something that starts below rock bottom. It’s pulled from research-backed books, behavioral science, therapy frameworks, podcasts and YouTube rabbit holes. No fluff, no guilt-tripping, no fake positivity.

Let’s get into it.

 Redefine “productive” to mean energy-neutral tasks

   If all your brain can manage is brushing your teeth while sitting down, that counts. Depression warps your expectations. So recalibrate your productivity scale to start where you actually are.

   Recommended by Dr. Julie Smith (clinical psychologist, author of Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before?): track small wins visually with a “done list,” not a to-do list. Crossing off “drank water” can be more powerful than you think.

 Use ""behavioral activation"" not motivation

   Waiting to feel like it doesn’t work. Behavioral activation means doing the action first, even if you feel like a zombie. Emotion follows action.

   The American Psychological Association confirms this as a primary tool in treating depression. It's a core component of CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy).

   Start with microtasks: open the doc, reply to one email, load the dishwasher. Not all of them. Just one,

 Leverage “low-friction” systems

   Depression makes everything feel effortful. So reduce decision fatigue as much as possible.  

     Wear the same outfit daily. 

     Cook one thing in bulk. 

     Use defaults. Automate bills. Set recurring orders. Use calendar reminders.

   Shane Parrish from the Farnam Street podcast calls this “designing for failure.” Meaning, assume bad days will happen and build systems that don't collapse when they do.

 Use the “2-minute rule” for momentum

   From James Clear’s Atomic Habits. If a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. 

   This isn’t about productivity. It’s about tricking your brain into movement. Depression thrives in stillness. Momentum, even slow, changes brain chemistry.

   Completing tiny tasks gives you a dopamine microdose. That helps regulate depressive inertia.

 Understand how executive dysfunction shows up in depression

   You’re not lazy. Your brain’s front lobe (the part that plans, organizes, initiates) is impaired. That’s executive function.

   According to the National Institute of Mental Health, depression can reduce activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex  the same area responsible for task execution.

   Use tools that externalize executive burden:

     Set timers for tasks (Pomodoro technique)

     Break steps into mindless chunks like: “Walk to sink → Turn on tap → Rinse mug → Done”

     Use visual task boards (Kanban, whiteboard sticky notes)

 Switch from “calendar planning” to “energy planning”

   Depression makes time unreliable. You may have 10 hours but only 30 minutes of usable energy. So budget energy, not time.

   Ali Abdaal talks about “biological prime time”  figure out when you have your highest mental alertness, even for 20 min. Put your most important task only there.

   Don’t spread effort evenly. Stack tasks into that one semi-functional hour, then rest guilt-free.

 Use “body-first” interventions to support cognition

   Harvard Medical School reports that regular movement, even light walking, helps improve depressive symptoms by increasing BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor).

   But forget hour-long gym workouts. Try:

     5 squats during coffee brew

     Lying on the floor with legs up a wall

     Walking outside for 3 minutes

   Pair movement with light: Sunlight helps regulate circadian rhythm and serotonin production. Just open a window or stand near light for a few minutes early in the day.

 Kill the zero day, but let your “wins” be microscopic

   Reddit legend u/ryans01 coined this in the r/getdisciplined community: A zero day is when you do nothing toward your goals.

   So, do anything. Even 10 seconds. Even one sentence of writing. That's a non-zero day. Non-zero = progress.

   The brain rewards consistency more than intensity.

 Use accountability without shame

   Depression isolates. You need gentle accountability, not pressure.

   Try:

     Body doubling via Focusmate or Discord study rooms

     Trello boards shared with a friend

     Daily check-ins via text with someone you trust

   Dr. Anna Lembke from Stanford (author of Dopamine Nation) emphasizes that meaningful connection and shared goals reduce dopamine dysregulation  a huge factor in depression.

 Don’t multitask emotional healing + performance

   Productivity while depressed should not also try to fix your mental health or prove your worth.

   Compartmentalize. You are allowed to do a task badly. You’re allowed to type slow, clean messily, plan sloppily.

   The goal is not excellence. The goal is motion.

 Start with one anchor routine. ONE.

   Overhauling routines never works in a depressive episode. But one non-negotiable can rebalance your day.

     Examples: Wake up and drink a glass of water. Walk outside at 10AM. Journal for 3 mins.

   Behavioral scientist BJ Fogg calls this “anchor habits”  small but consistent actions that stabilize your identity.

 Learn your personal “activation levers”

   Depression isn't one-size-fits-all. Some people need stimulation. Others need comfort.

   Track what moves you a little:

     Music with strong rhythm

     Audiobooks narrated with emotion

     Videos like “Study With Me Pomodoro” on YouTube

   Self-experiment like a scientist. No judgment. Just data collection.

Recommended books and resources:

 Lost Connections by Johann Hari  explores root causes of depression beyond chemical imbalance, including lack of meaningful work and disconnection

 The Mindful Way Through Depression by Mark Williams  proven mindfulness-based CBT tools

 The Happiness Lab podcast by Dr. Laurie Santos  breaks down science of well-being in micro-doses

Productivity while depressed isn’t pretty. But it’s possible. It just requires a totally different operating system. One built on compassion, not hustle.

You’re not broken. You’re just running on low battery. So stop expecting full-function behavior from a drained system. Plug in differently.

These aren’t magical fixes. But they're levers. And when used together, over time, they do help you get unstuck.",1,1763307811.0,LockedInMan,0,1.0,False

1oyouci,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonSocialClub/comments/1oyouci/lf_writing_partner_world_building_collaborator_in/,LF Writing Partner / World Building Collaborator in Boston / Cambridge — Dark Mythic Sci-Fi Universe,"Hey everyone,

I’m looking for a writing/worldbuilding partner to help develop a long-form, mythic post-apocalyptic universe I’ve been building for a few years. I’m based in Cambridge, MA, and would love to start with a friendly in-person meetup (coffee, bookstore, whatever) to talk through ideas before committing to anything long-term.

# About the Project

The universe is a dark, philosophical sci-fi/fantasy world with:

* deep cosmology and mythic influences (Gilgamesh, Hindu cosmology, Dante, etc.)  
* political collapse, prophecy, and generational conflict  
* a blend of spiritual mysticism and post-apocalyptic technology  
* multiple POVs, long-form arcs, and a strong sense of tonal contrast between characters  

Book One is complete (for now), Book Two is in progress, and I'm also developing a connected video game project. It’s a universe with room for new characters, cultures, histories, and mythologies so collaboration matters a lot.

# What I’m Looking For

I’m hoping to find someone who:

* enjoys world building at a deep, structural level. Especially looking to develop new factions.  
* likes discussing lore, cultures, politics, myths, and long-form arcs.  
* enjoys brainstorming and building ideas collaboratively. I approach collaboration casually and form ideas through genuine mind share.  
* is comfortable with dark themes, emotional intensity, symbolic writing and subtlety.  
* is patient enough to build something ambitious, not rushed.  

You do NOT need to be a co-author out of the gate.  
 I want to start with conversations, idea exchanges, and small worldbuilding sessions to see if our styles and personalities match.

If we click, we can scale up the collaboration at whatever pace makes sense.

# IP / Ownership

I am in the process of copyrighting the story and its universe (already filed). For now, I'm being very careful with sharing files with strangers. Just looking to explore and worldbuild together at first. If we eventually co-write or co-create, we can formalize roles and rights properly.

# About Me

* Based in Cambridge  
* Technical Program Manager  
* Been building this universe for years  
* Love myth, philosophy, dark fantasy, and anything with layered symbolism  
* Video game enthusiast. Driven inspiration from Dark Souls, Fallout, Borderlands, Ninja Gaiden.   
* Prefer present-tense, character-driven storytelling from the observer’s perspective.   
* Looking for someone collaborative, curious, and excited to build something big.  

# If you're interested

Drop a comment or DM me with:

* a little about what you like writing.  
* any influences you have.  
* whether you’re local to Cambridge/Boston.  
* and if you’d want to meet up to chat.  

Looking forward to meeting someone who wants to build a universe together.

1oyosda,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oyosda,aKin (*) Toronto,"Akin was recently awarded a star and is a relatively new entry in Toronto's fine dining scene. We were quite pleased with the entire experience.

Dishes are all takes on night market food

Snacks/Amuse: Takes on Banh Mi, Kimbap, Papaya Salad and Satay

Chicken Karaage - essentially a chicken sausage fried in its own skin - Caviar for some umami. A great dish which felt like eating upscaled fast food.

Tom Yum- umi, hiramasa, coconut - tomato (and I think carrot) pearls

Haninan Chicken Rice - one bite, explode in your mouth goodness, with some texture from jasmine rice. The second spoon here is the cocktail pairing which was also a one bite explosion - cannot recall the details but a great orange flavor

Dumpling - this was a standout for me - lamb neck, mala broth, allium. The dumpling is a ""hundred pinch"" dumpling and we were told each takes 15 minutes to make by hand. The broth was outstanding with great depth of flavour typical of bone broths.

Takoyaki - deconstructed - the octopus is flash cooked at high temp and was crispy outside while perfectly tender and moist inside. The ""beignet"" was a miss for me - mostly dough with some less than flavorful cheese within. While the octopus was great, this dish was the miss of the night for me.

Chili Crab - Dungeness crab, montou, tomalley - rice in various states provide great texture.

Dou Fu Fa - almond milk, kefir and strawberry (missing photo on this one)

Mango Sticky Rice - great presentation - less sweet than I like dessert, however very typical of asian desserts.

Petit Four - one bite confections: Thai Iced Tea, Air Jagung, Bubble Tea, Vietnamese Coffee

Service was friendly and not stuffy - they showed up at the right time and did all the right things, can't fault anything here.

Pairing - I had the wine pairing, partner had cocktail pairing and we kind of shared each. The cocktails stood out more than the wines with respect to experimentation - they play with viscosity in ways I have not experienced and lends both a mouth feel and presentation I haven't tasted or seen before.

Overall, the star is deserved. With respect to competitors in the area, aKin was much better than a recent visit to Alo, and not as good as Peal Morrisette (which recently got a second star). I think it is doing quite well relative to the other one star experiences in the city.",3,1763307509.0,finedining,0,0.8,False
1oyorvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/INFPIdeas/comments/1oyorvo/success_story_how_costa_rica_protects_both_people/,Success Story: How Costa Rica Protects Both People and Planet,"Costa Rica is one of the clearest real-world examples of a country choosing to put environmental health, social well-being, and long-term sustainability at the center of national policy. While no country is perfect, Costa Rica consistently ranks among the world’s leaders in biodiversity protection, renewable energy, democratic stability, and public health. Much of this comes from deliberate choices made over decades. 

Below is a breakdown of the major ways Costa Rica protects its environment and its people, along with the key drivers behind this “people-and-planet-first” national approach.


1. Protecting more than a quarter of the entire country as national parks

Costa Rica has set aside over 25% of its land as protected areas as national parks, biological reserves, wildlife refuges, and forest preserves. This is one of the highest proportions on Earth. These protections safeguard rainforests, cloud forests, mangroves, wetlands, and coral reefs, enabling biodiversity recovery while supporting nature-based tourism.

2. Restoring forests through payment-for-ecosystem-services programs

In the 1980s, Costa Rica had one of the highest deforestation rates in the world. Today, it has doubled its forest cover thanks to the “Pago por Servicios Ambientales” (PSA) program, which pays landowners to conserve, reforest, or sustainably manage land. Farmers, communities, and indigenous groups receive compensation for storing carbon, protecting watersheds, and preserving wildlife habitat.

3. Running the electricity grid largely on renewable energy

Costa Rica has operated on 98–100% renewable electricity for most years over the past decade, relying on hydroelectric power, geothermal energy from volcanoes, wind, and solar. This drastically reduces air pollution, lowers dependency on fossil fuels, and keeps energy prices stable.

4. Eliminating the military to redirect funds toward health and education

In 1948, Costa Rica abolished its military, permanently reallocating that budget to universal education, healthcare, and environmental protection. This unique decision strengthened democratic institutions and contributed to some of the highest human-development indicators in Latin America.

5. Prioritizing universal healthcare and preventive public health systems

Costa Rica’s public health system (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social) emphasizes prevention, primary care, community clinics, vaccination programs, and equitable access. This, along with lower pollution levels, has produced long life expectancy, low maternal mortality, and strong population health.

6. Strengthening indigenous land rights and community stewardship

Indigenous territories (which overlap with some of the most biodiverse regions) have legal recognition, allowing communities to manage forests according to traditional knowledge. Community-led conservation has contributed to successful forest recovery and watershed protection.

7. Building a strong ecotourism economy that rewards conservation

Ecotourism is a major part of Costa Rica’s economy - and because visitors come for pristine ecosystems, the country has strong incentives to maintain parks, protect wildlife, and ensure clean rivers and coastlines. Park fees, guided tours, and community lodges all support local jobs tied directly to healthy ecosystems.

8. Investing heavily in environmental education

Costa Rica integrates ecology, biodiversity, and sustainability into early education. Children learn about watersheds, forests, wildlife, and conservation through hands-on field trips and community projects, helping build an environmentally literate generation.

9. Mitigating climate risk through robust disaster preparedness

Because of its geography, Costa Rica invests in strong early-warning systems, community preparedness, watershed conservation, and climate adaptation strategies. Healthy forests, wetlands, and mangroves help buffer floods and storms, protecting people and infrastructure.

10. Promoting regenerative agriculture and sustainable farming

Costa Rica supports agroforestry systems, shade-grown coffee, reduced pesticide use (with plans to transition away from some chemicals), and soil conservation programs. Farmers who use sustainable practices can access eco-certifications and receive technical assistance.

11. Expanding wildlife corridors to allow species to move safely

The country has created biological corridors that connect fragmented ecosystems, enabling jaguars, tapirs, monkeys, birds, and thousands of other species to migrate and maintain genetic diversity. This strategy supports long-term biodiversity resilience.


Key Drivers Behind Costa Rica’s People-and-Planet-First Approach 🌼 

1. A cultural identity rooted in peace, nature, and democracy

Costa Rica’s national ethos is “pura vida”. It emphasizes simplicity, community, and nature. The country’s long democratic tradition and lack of a military contribute to a culture that values environmental protection over aggressive development.

2. Stable democratic institutions and long-term planning

Environmental laws, social programs, and land protections span multiple administrations, creating policy stability. Long-term planning ensures that investments in health, forests, and water systems persist across political cycles.

3. Seeing environmental protection as an economic strategy, not a cost

Costa Rica treats nature as something that generates revenue, regulates water, stores carbon, attracts tourism, and stabilizes climate. This framing has been key to making conservation politically and economically sustainable.

4. Strong collaboration among government, communities, NGOs, and scientists

Costa Rica is known for cooperative governance. Conservation policies are often developed with input from researchers, landowners, indigenous communities, and environmental NGOs, creating broader support for implementation.",4,1763307474.0,INFPIdeas,0,1.0,False

I decided last minute and said fuck it I'll do the Takao-Kiyotaki River trek. I also originally meant to go all the way to Hozukyo but noticed I was already close to Otagi Nenbutsuji so I took a shortcut. Here's my Day 1 itinerary:

- Took two buses from Sanjo to Takao
- Had overpriced breakfast near Jingo-ji
- Climbed up to Jingo-ji, it was exhausting but rewarding. Got the prettiest goshuinjo ever
- Had a beautiful 2(?) hr trek through Kiyotaki river. I loved the maple trees and cedars along the way
- Stopped by Otagi Nenbutsuji
- Visited Adashino Nenbutsuji, beautiful and not too crowded. Go here instead of Arashiyama if you want pictures (or not lol)
- Had a snack along Saga-Toriimoto (Tea and Coffee Hijiri is highly recommended)
- Walked up to Arashiyama Bamboo Forest but went into Tenryu-ji instead not knowing I wouldn't be able to easily get back there. I'm fine with that because of Adashino. The garden is vast and pretty but the goshuin is printed :(
- Strolled through Togetsukyo Bridge and its surroundings. It was already dark
- Took the bus back to the hotel

Tips
- Bring loads of cash for Arashiyama. I wasted time going to the JR station just to get money exchanged because I didn't have enough
- Buses are super convenient I'm amazed by Google's accuracy
- Rest well before and don't be like me that did all this on maybe 4 hours of sleep. Wish me luck for tomorrow

For day 2, should I do Kiyomizudera first (much closer) or Fushimi Inari? I could probably get there early but the shops won't be open yet. Trying to avoid crowds as Arashiyama really disappointed me. Thanks !!",1,1763307467.0,JapanTravelTips,2,1.0,False

They are all very reliable, especially the 2 coffee machines I have, the Barista Express I had it for more than a decade and it still works fine. Because I trusted brand, so I also bought the Oracle.

Also because I trusted Breville brand.

I bought AquaStation™ Chilled + Hot, LWA600BSS2IAN1 during black friday 2024, I got it from Amazon.

It wasn't the best product I had from Breville, it has its issues here and there, but normally can be fixed with a reboot.

But few months ago, it died and can no longer heat up hot water.

Follow the RMA process, I sent to the nearest repair centre, waited for a bit longer than 2 weeks, told it was unrepairable, so Breville arranged to send me a new one.

Great service I have to say, little did I know, it where things starts to go wrong.

To save you details.

This first replacement, brand new from box, leaking water from bottom.

I know what you going to say, is it from too much water on top?

Is it because the drain valve at the bottom is losen? No...I have gone through the diagnosis with RMA team. I have to show them it's leaking from bottom.

imagine I have to keep try and fail and see water coming from bottom.

It's not a fast leak, it's like dripping.

So I put machine on the counter on the first day, next morning, all the water are on the floor and counter.



well, they issued the return label, and very quickly, shipped me another new one.

should be end of the story right?



no...after exactly 10 uses in 4 days, it shows Error E03, and reboot, it's still E03.

no hot water.



so I am currently contacting Breville RMA again.

I am in computer hardware industry, 1 DOA is just bad luck, 1 RMA and replacement DOA, it's already sus.

  
Now it's pretty much 1RMA, 2DOA in a row.

This is serious product issues, I wonder if you guys who have this product have the same issue?

Are they trying to avoid a product call back or something?

The Ultimate Nutella Tiramisu

This recipe swaps out the traditional cocoa powder for a generous layer of Nutella, adding a deep hazelnut and chocolate flavor that pairs perfectly with the coffee and mascarpone.

Yield: Serves 9-12
Prep Time:30 minutes
Chill Time:6 hours (or preferably overnight)

---

Ingredients

For the Coffee Soak:

· 1 ½ cups (355 ml) strong brewed coffee or espresso, cooled to room temperature
· 2 tablespoons coffee liqueur (like Kahlúa) or dark rum (optional)
· 1 tablespoon granulated sugar

For the Mascarpone Filling:

· 3 large egg yolks
· ½ cup (100g) granulated sugar
· 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
· 16 oz (450g) mascarpone cheese, softened at room temperature
· 1 cup (240ml) heavy cream, cold
· 1 jar (13 oz / 370g) Nutella

For Assembly:

· 24-28 Ladyfinger cookies (Savoiardi)
· ½ cup (about 50g) toasted, chopped hazelnuts, for garnish (optional)

---

Instructions

1. Prepare the Coffee Soak:
In a shallow bowl wide enough to dip a ladyfinger,combine the cooled coffee, coffee liqueur (if using), and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves. Set aside.

2. Make the Mascarpone Filling:

· In a heatproof bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and ½ cup of sugar. Place the bowl over a pot of gently simmering water (double boiler), making sure the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water. Whisk constantly for 5-7 minutes until the mixture becomes pale, thick, and hot to the touch. This step pasteurizes the eggs.
· Remove from the heat and whisk in the vanilla extract. Let it cool for 10-15 minutes.
· In a separate large bowl, use a hand mixer or whisk to beat the softened mascarpone until smooth and creamy.
· Gently fold the cooled egg yolk mixture into the mascarpone until just combined and smooth. Be careful not to overmix.
· In another chilled bowl, whip the cold heavy cream until it holds stiff peaks.
· Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture in two additions until no white streaks remain. Your filling should be light and fluffy.

3. Assemble the Tiramisu:

· First Layer: Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture for 1-2 seconds per side. You want them moist but not soggy and falling apart. Arrange a single layer of dipped ladyfingers in the bottom of a 9x9 inch (or similar 2.5-3 quart) dish.
· Second Layer: Spread half of the mascarpone cream mixture evenly over the ladyfingers.
· Third Layer: Now, for the star of the show! Spoon generous dollops of Nutella (about half the jar) over the mascarpone layer. Use a spoon or offset spatula to gently spread it into an even layer.
· Repeat: Create another layer of coffee-dipped ladyfingers, followed by the remaining mascarpone cream.
· Final Touch: Warm the remaining Nutella slightly in the microwave for 15-20 seconds to make it easier to drizzle. Drizzle it artistically over the top layer of mascarpone cream.

4. Chill and Serve:

· Cover the dish tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, but overnight is highly recommended. This crucial resting time allows the flavors to meld and the ladyfingers to soften perfectly.
· Just before serving, sprinkle with the toasted chopped hazelnuts for a delightful crunch.

---

Chef's Tips & Variations

· Egg-Free Option: Omit the egg yolk and sugar cooking step. Simply whip the heavy cream with the ½ cup of sugar and vanilla until stiff peaks form, then fold it into the softened mascarpone.
· Alcohol-Free: Simply leave out the coffee liqueur. The dessert will still be fantastic.
· The Ladyfinger Dip: The key to the perfect texture is a quick dip. If you let them sit too long, they will become mushy and make the tiramisu watery.
· Softening Nutella: If your Nutella is very thick, gently warming the entire jar in a bowl of warm water (without getting water in it) will make it much easier to spread.
· Make it a Cake: You can also assemble this in a 9-inch springform pan for a beautiful, sliceable cake presentation.
· Storage: This tiramisu will keep beautifully in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 3 days.

Enjoy your incredibly delicious, crowd-pleasing Nutella Tiramisu

I’m working on an AI agent development kit focused on making it easier to *debug, trace, and actually understand* what your agents are doing behind the scenes.

I’m talking to developers who build agents, tool-using systems, or LLM workflows, and I want to understand the real challenges you’re dealing with — especially around:

* Debugging multi-step agent behavior
* Tracing tool calls or reasoning chains
* Reproducing inconsistent or flaky runs
* Understanding why an agent took a specific action
* Missing observability or opaque internal states
* Tooling gaps that slow you down
* Features you *wish* existed but don’t
* Anything that still feels like a total black box

This is not a sales pitch — just market research and genuine curiosity. I’d love to grab a casual coffee chat and learn from your experience.

I've known ""A"" for around 10 years, we've always been together in class, but we became best friends four years ago.

We had a WhatsApp group with some friends (a couple of them were long-distance while the others lived in the same place as us) we used to play videogames together. I'm that group, ""A"" began dating ""B"" In a long distance relationship that lasted one or two months. It was ""A"" first relationship, and they really cared about each other but they had a lot of communication problems, and ""B"" ended up breaking up with him. I watched the whole relationship because I was close with both of them (they both came to me to tell me the issues they had with each other), they simply looked for different things and that was completely fine; except for one thing I saw that threw me off: One day, ""A"" called me to tell me a plan he had so ""B"" would show him an specific Instagram chat he had seen a glimpse of once; he said 'I will ask ""B"" to show me some videos dancing, and the moment ""B"" opens Instagram, I'll threaten with breaking up if they don't show me the messages of the chat.' He said it with such an excited tone I was disturbed by how toxic the idea was. I managed to convince him not to do it, but ""B"" broke up with him anyways the following day.
Anyways, when they broke up, ""B"" wanted them to keep being friends, but ""A"" was heartbroken and left the whole WhatsApp group, lthough he kept speaking to ""B"" from time to time.
That happened at the end of summer 2024, then, me and ""A"" started a new course in a new centre. We've both always been a bit shy at the moment of meeting new people, but as he had left the videogame group, he was completely convinced I was his only friend and he was so obsessed with meeting new people that he began pushing me to talk to our new classmates although I had discovered I had social anxiety and even had a panic attack in the middle of the hallway between classes. He wasn't pushing me on purpose, but it hurt me anyways, he was the only friend I had there and he still insisted he had to make new friends as soon as possible and convince himself ""B"" was a horrible person so he could get over with the relationship as soon as possible. He confessed me that every time he had to write a text in class, he would manage to modify his text so it worked as a criticism to ""B"".

In December of that year, ""A"" rejoined the videogame group, and played with me and ""B"". However, ""A"" was acting off, he seemed to try to modify his personality and way of acting so he got along with people; he was making dumb jokes and comments that made no one laugh, and even come off as annoying. Both ""B"" and me agreed in that. We ended up talking about it to ""A"" and he kinda apologized, but kept doing it anyways. And after every call the three of us made, ""A"" would call me to insult ""B"" and say they were annoying him on purpose by simple things such as calling him by another person's name by mistake (it was always names of other people in the group, and they also did it to me, it was obvious it was on purpose).
That month, we made a friend in class called ""C"", who was also lonely in class and I spent most breaks with (""A"" always went talk to other people at breaks, and I'd spend them alone until I met ""C"")

In March, I made a new friend group outside school, and became much happier. ""A"" and ""C"" got mad though, because I spent less time outside class with them since I knew that new group. The thing was I saw them every single day at class, and the interactions I had with ""A"" at that point weren't very good (he now made those annoying comments in real life too, and wouldn't stop even when I asked him to), and ""C"" was becoming paranoid because I wouldn't tell him everything that was up with my life (and that made me want to talk to him even less), while when I went outside with the new friend group I'd feel happy and accepted.

At the end of April, ""A"" was paranoid I was going out with vandals or something like that ""C"" had told him (none of them new the people I was meeting, but they were nice people), the only ilegal thing we had done was that the day I had met them, we grabbed a couple of screws from a rope pyramid that had like 30, and kept them. The rope pyramid was still stabled even with 8 people climbing it at the same time, we checked. I know it was a dumb thing to do, but ""A"" is still obsessed with it until this day.). ""A"" and me made a phone call that lasted around an hour and half, where he told me things such as ""you've changed"" and ""Guess we aren't going to be friends anymore"", I was so confused, because I had no idea in which sense I had changed, and o didn't want to lose him as a friend. We both ended up crying a lot with that call, we both explained things and I promised him I'd do better and that there was no reason to stop being friends.

In that year, I had developed a crush for a girl in my class who I'll call ""S"". We were both really shy, and she was always with a friend, so I did talk to her from time to time, specially through message, but I had barely had a meaningful conversation with her, still I wished with my very soul to get to know her better and at least have her as a friend because she was a really sweet person. At the end of May, we got to truly talk (it was such a nice conversation I realize we could really we friends), and began sitting next to each other in one subject twice a week and talk together. We also met a few times during summer. (""A"" was the only person aware I liked her, bit he didn't know we met in summer).

""C"" and me talked in June and fixed everything, he apologized for being kinda controlling, and he's been a good friend to me ever since. 

The first week of July, the whole ""old"" friend group met. We were ""A"", ""C"", three more friends that were studying in different highschools. The hangout was fine at first, but at some point ""A"" began criticizing ""S"" for crying after an exam in front of the teacher. I was so mad, ""C"" was the only one paying attention, while the others looked away because they didn't even know who he was talking about. Meanwhile I stared at a tree trying not to say something because if I had done it wouldn't have been pretty at all, and decided to talk about it to ""A"" in private the following time I'd see him.

A few days later, I met him for coffee. We talked a bit about life, and the conversation went pretty well, until I touched the subject. He got defensive instantly, but he ended up half agreeing with me. The conversation went down hill, he got mad and began blaming me for asking him homework at class when I forgot them (it was true I had asked him for his notebook a lot, but he never told me it bothered him and I didn't think it was a big deal because I wasn't copying in an exam or a project or anything like that, it was just homework). Seeing there was no way to fix the conversation, I made up an excuse and went home, he didn't even say goodbye.

Weeks went by, we hadn't talked since then and I forgot about it. It was one of the last days of July, we celebrated ""C""'s birthday. The moment I got home, around 11:30pm, I got a message from ""A"" that said: ""I've been mad at you since we met at the coffeeshop. Just so you know in case you haven't realized. I was waiting for your apology because I thought it was obvious that what you had done was wrong, but now I see it's not that obvious."" I asked what he meant I did wrong and he said ""everything, literally everything."" I asked him to define ""everything"" and he replied ""from the beginning to the end"". I was too tired to deal with an argument (""A"" could perfectly argue until 4:00 am) so I decided to go to sleep.

The following morning, we had an argument through text that was so long and completely useless, it was a waste of time and got us nowhere. He replied to my arguments with a ""you're not right."" And he would repeat his without changing anything although it had already been refuted. It just gave me a headache.

""C"" hanged out with me to ask me about ""A"", because it seemed he had began to insult me and complain about me with him. ""C"" even showed me some screenshots, the was one that specifically pained me that said: ""I've gotten more over stop being friends with (me) that to have stopped dating ""B"""", it had went by a whole year since they had broken up, a whole year since a month long distance relationship ended, while me and ""A"" had been friends for 10 years, best friends for four. It hurted me so much, and in that moment I realized ""A"" didn't want to make up with me, he had convinced himself I was a bad person and didn't care about him at all. It went through my mind every time I had helped him with his problems, his family, his relationship with ""B""... And I tried to remember last time he had truly helped me, which was 3 years ago where I had to go to the police because something really bad had happened to a friend of mine and ""A"" went there with me.

I talked to ""B"", and we made a phone call. They texted ""A"" to ask how he was, feigning they hadn't heard about me in a long time. They asked about me, and the first thing ""A"" said was that I had changed and that I stole screws. The screw thing had happened half a year before. ""B"" was displaying screen to me while texting ""A"", it was so twisted seeing how much ""A"" simped ""B"" through texting them while he criticized them with anyone who didn't know them (I saw him once telling a few classmates about how his relationship was and he portrayed ""B"" as a literal demon who didn't care about him the slightest.), and I was sure he talked about me the same way to other people.

Anyways, ""C"" insisted that we should make up, and we gave it a try at the end of August. ""C"" acted as a mediator between us, and after a really long talk, we supposedly made up. I had nothing against ""A"", but I had seen in his eyes he wasn't totally convinced, but he said nothing.

When this course started, the third day, ""C"", ""A"" and me were in the hallway, waiting in front of what it was meant to be math class, but we saw no one else around, so ""A"" said ""I'll ask someone."" He walked away and never came back. ""C"" and me got nervous, and began searching everywhere for half an hour, until a found him in a random class that was the actual math class... Sitting next to ""S"" although there were like 6 other seats available and they barely talked. (""S""'s friend, who she was always with, was in a different math subject.)

The following day, I tried to talk to ""A"" about the seat, but she shrugged it off. I got mad, because he knew I liked her, and he had only got that seat because he didn't even tell us where the class was and got there faster. I went to that class five minutes early and sat on his seat (there were only 5 people more in that moment, and three of them were sitting on top of the desk I used the previous day.) a couple minutes of minutes later, he came to the class with two more people, put his hands on my table and said ""get off of my seat. Get off of my seat. Get off of my seat or I swear I'll stop talking to you for the rest of the course."" I tried to reason with him (without telling him about ""S"" because other people were listening, offering him to let me have this seat half of the time and he could have it the other time) but he refused. The he took another seat and began making dumb comments about the ceiling fan to the two people he had came to class with. I took a deep breath and sighed asking myself if this was really worth it. I knew ""A"" was able to spend every break in that class just so I didn't have that seat, and I wasn't in the mood for it. So I stood up and took my now free previous seat.

After that, ""S"" confessed me she was so uncomfortable with ""A"" sitting next to her becau he was staring at her direction the whole time. I felt the urging need to steal his seat so bad, even if I don't seat there in exchange... But I sadly didn't because I didn't want more conflict. I was mad at him though, because if I had sat next to ""B"" while ""A"" had a crush on them, I would had given my seat to ""A"" with no doubt. I feel like he broke a friendship code, and adding that to everything it has happened with him until that point, the moment he ""asked"" me to talk about it through text (he'd simply spit every ""bad"" thing I had done to him until that point, blaming me for every single bad thing that has happened to him until that point) I replied to him saying that we aren't friends anymore and to have a great life.

The thing is, I lied, I don't wish him the best, I wish him the worst. I now find myself wishing to erase his pathetic smile every time he makes a comment, every time he argues with teachers because his answer is better that theirs. I've never actually hated someone before, but it feels horrible to do so. It's impossible to ignore him because he's little Mr perfect and in his own words ""the only thing he's good at are studies"". The moment the seat thing happened, he ran to tell a common friend about it and insult, which that friend told to a really close friend of mine and told me.

I don't like wishing someone the worst, but I feel he deserves it because how much of a garbage friend he's been to me. AITA for hating him?",1,1763306975.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

She and my brother constantly targets me talks about me behind my back and pushes me out the house I have a video of my brother kicking me for telling him to stop hitting the dogs while I was a couple weeks pregnant and my bf sent the video to a detective and they didn’t do anything.

⭐ My Experience Traveling from Mumbai to Atlanta: Indigo Airlines vs. Turkish Airlines

I recently traveled from Mumbai to Atlanta, and my journey involved two airlines — IndiGo Airlines (India) and Turkish Airlines (Turkey). The experiences were drastically different, and I want to share them for anyone planning international travel.


---

🇮🇳 IndiGo Airlines – Disappointing for an International Flight

My experience with IndiGo on an international route was honestly below expectations.

What Went Wrong:

No in-flight entertainment: There were no screens, so watching movies or passing time wasn’t possible.

Food quality was poor: The food was served in a small box/bucket, and it didn’t taste good. Only one meal was provided for the entire long journey.

Paid basic items: When I asked for a black coffee, I was told it was chargeable.

No blankets or pillows: Nothing was offered — no blanket, no pillow, not even small comfort items.

No snacks: Apart from water, nothing was available unless you paid for it.

Cabin crew attitude: The air hostesses didn’t smile, weren’t engaging, and seemed more focused on themselves than the passengers. The overall behavior felt unfriendly.


Overall, the flight felt empty and uncomfortable — no amenities, no warmth, and very little service.


---

🇹🇷 Turkish Airlines – A Truly Pleasant Experience

In complete contrast, Turkish Airlines offered a fantastic international travel experience.

What Made It Great:

Warm welcome: From the moment I reached the gate, the staff was polite, helpful, and smiling.

Seat change without hesitation: I asked for an aisle seat, and they searched and changed it immediately without any attitude.

Hot towel service: As soon as we boarded, they offered warm towels to freshen up.

Proper snacks and drinks: Water, drinks, and snacks were offered multiple times.

Delicious meals: The food was genuinely good. Even when I didn’t feel like eating and returned the tray, the staff was polite about it.

Fully working entertainment system: Screens worked perfectly, good selection of movies, and the headset quality was nice.

Comfort kit provided: Blanket, pillow, socks, slippers, toothbrush, toothpaste — everything was included for free.

Responsive and caring crew: We called them multiple times, and they always responded with a smile.
One of the nicest things — when we asked for snacks, they mixed different items in a bowl just for us.

Overall hospitality: The cabin crew was cheerful, attentive, and genuinely made the journey pleasant.

⭐ Conclusion

This trip made one thing very clear: **Middle Eastern and Turkish airlines (like Qatar, Emirates, Etihad, and Turkish Airlines) are far ahead in hospitality with the same fare charged by Indian airlines. ",4,1763306840.0,TurkishAirlines,1,1.0,False

I have. Constantly. When I moved to a new city, I was paralyzed by safety anxiety. Every plan started with a dozen Google searches: ""is \[neighborhood\] safe at night,"" ""safe for solo women,"" etc. Friends gave conflicting advice, my parents were worried sick, and online forums were a mix of outdated posts and unhelpful ""I felt fine"" anecdotes.

Social media shows picture-perfect solo trips, but it never shows the reality of clutching your keys in your pocket or skipping an event because you're not sure how you'll get back alone.

I realized the information I needed didn't exist. Nobody tracks the data that *actually* matters: not which cafe has the best coffee, but whether you'll get harassed on the 10-minute walk there at 7 PM.

So, I decided to build the solution myself: **Safe or Not**.

It's a community platform where people can share and find real, street-level safety information. The goal is to build a trusted network, which is why I'm keeping the community curated, especially in these early stages. The moment a platform like this gets too big, it fills with noise and fake reviews.

I'm launching with a limited number of spots for foundational members who genuinely care about this problem. If you've ever felt that safety anxiety and want to be part of building a real solution, I'd love for you to join.

1oyocax,https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTQWritersPlace/comments/1oyocax/why_write_what_you_know_is_terrible_advice/,Why “Write What You Know” Is Terrible Advice,"Every writer has heard it. Usually from someone who has never written a book. Sometimes from a teacher who means well. Occasionally from a relative who thinks they’re being helpful while also wondering why you don’t have a “real job.”

*Write what you know.*

It sounds wise, doesn’t it? It sounds safe. It sounds like the kind of advice you might find inside a fortune cookie that was written by a committee of accountants. But let’s pause and examine this phrase with the kind of scrutiny normally reserved for suspicious leftovers in the fridge.

Because here’s the truth: “Write what you know” is terrible advice.

Here’s the problem with the fortune cookie method. Imagine if chefs only cooked what they knew. We would all be eating the same three meals forever. Imagine if musicians only played what they knew. Every concert would be a cover band. Imagine if explorers only traveled where they already lived. The maps would still say “Here Be Dragons” because nobody would have bothered to check.

Writing isn’t about staying inside the walls of your own experience. Writing is about breaking them down, climbing over them, and occasionally setting them on fire for dramatic effect.

If writers only wrote what they knew, we would have no dragons, no starships, no courtroom dramas unless the author happened to be a lawyer. We would have no hobbits, no dystopias, no romances set in Paris unless the author had personally dated someone under the Eiffel Tower.

The advice collapses under its own weight.

What Do We Mean by “Know”?

The real problem is that the word *know* is slippery. Does it mean:

Personal experience?

Emotional truth?

Research?

Something you overheard once in a coffee shop?

If “know” means personal experience, then only astronauts can write space operas, only surgeons can write medical thrillers, and only vampires can write vampire novels. Which is inconvenient, because vampires rarely submit manuscripts on time.

If “know” means emotional truth, then the advice is redundant. Of course, you must write emotions you understand. Fear, love, grief, joy… these are the currencies of fiction. But you don’t need to have fought in a war to write about courage. You don’t need to have robbed a bank to write about desperation. You just need empathy, imagination, and the willingness to research until the unfamiliar feels normal.

If “know” means research, then the advice is misleading. It should say *“Write what you’re willing to learn.”* That would be honest. That would be useful. That would save writers years of confusion.

What do writers actually do? Writers invent. Writers extrapolate. Writers stitch together fragments of reality and imagination until the seams disappear.

Tolkien didn’t “know” hobbits. He knew languages, myth, and human nature.

Mary Shelley didn’t “know” how to reanimate corpses. She knew grief, science, and the fear of human ambition.

Octavia Butler didn’t “know” the future. She knew history, injustice, and the patterns of human behavior.

Every great work of fiction is built on things the author didn’t literally know. What they knew was how to make the unfamiliar feel real.

So let’s retire “Write what you know.” Let’s replace it with something more honest.

*Write what you can make real.*

*Write what you can imagine with conviction.*

*Write what you’re willing to research until it feels real.*

*Write what you’re willing to risk knowing.*

Because writing isn’t about comfort. Writing is about risk. It’s about stepping into the unknown and dragging your readers with you, whether they like it or not.

Research is your best friend. If you want to write about something you don’t know, research is your ally. Research is the difference between a believable courtroom drama and a scene where the lawyer shouts “Objection!” at the wrong time.

Research isn’t just about facts. It’s about texture. It’s about the smell of a hospital corridor, the rhythm of military jargon, the way a pilot checks instruments before takeoff. These details make the unfamiliar feel lived in.

And here’s the secret: research is fun. It’s procrastination disguised as productivity. It’s the excuse to read strange books, interview fascinating people, and spend hours on YouTube watching videos titled *“How to Survive a Medieval Siege.”*

Facts alone are not enough. You also need empathy. You need to understand how people feel in situations you have never experienced.

You don’t need to be a soldier to write war. You need to understand fear, loyalty, and loss. You don’t need to be a doctor to write medical drama. You need to understand urgency, responsibility, and exhaustion.

Empathy is the bridge between what you know and what you don’t. It allows you to translate human emotions into any context.

Curiosity is the reason writers can write about anything. Curiosity is the permission slip to explore.

When you write about something you don’t know, you are not faking it. You’re discovering it. You’re learning as you go, and your readers are learning with you.

This is why “Write what you know” is terrible advice. It discourages curiosity. It tells writers to stay in their lane. But writing isn’t about lanes. Writing is about detours, shortcuts, and occasionally driving straight through the cornfield because you want to see what happens. Of course, I wouldn’t recommend that unless you own the cornfield and the car.

So what should writers actually do?

Research until you know everything, then keep researching until you know more.  
Don’t stop at Wikipedia. Read memoirs, watch documentaries, talk to people who have lived through it.

You don’t need the same experience. You need the ability to feel those experiences.

Stay curious. Let writing be the way you discover what you don’t know.

Risk knowing. Be willing to step into the unknown, even if you stumble.

The Snack theory of writing is my personal favorite. Let’s pause for a snack. Because writing advice is easier to digest when paired with food metaphors.

“Write what you know” is like telling someone to only eat snacks they’ve already tried. Safe, boring, predictable. But the joy of snacks is discovery. The strange flavor of a new brand of crisps, the new pastry, the candy from another country. Writing should be the same.

Try the unfamiliar. Taste the unknown. If it’s terrible, spit it out and try again. If it’s wonderful, share it with everyone.

The Danger of Comfort is the real danger of “Write what you know”. It keeps writers comfortable. Comfort is the enemy of creativity. Comfort produces safe stories, predictable plots, and characters who feel like cardboard cutouts.

Risk produces discovery. Risk produces originality. Risk produces the kind of stories that make readers sit up and say, *“I’ve never seen this before.”*

Let’s imagine a circle. Inside the circle is what you know. Outside the circle is what you don’t know.

If you only write inside the circle, your stories will be small. If you step outside the circle, your stories will expand. The circle itself will grow. What you don’t know will become what you know.

This is how writers evolve. This is how imagination works.

So let us say it clearly: “Write what you know” is terrible advice because it mistakes comfort for creativity.

Better advice? Write what you’re willing to risk knowing. Write what you can make real. Write what you can imagine with conviction.

Because if writers only wrote what they knew, we would all be stuck reading memoirs about grocery shopping. And while that might be fascinating for one chapter, nobody wants twelve volumes on the history of your local supermarket.

Writing isn’t permission. Writing is participation. It’s the act of stepping into the unknown and inviting readers to join you.

So don’t write what you know. Write what you don’t know yet. Write what you’re willing to discover. Write what you’re willing to risk. Write what gives you passionate feelings. If you aren’t passionate about what you’re writing, then your readers won’t be either.

That is how stories are born. That is how imagination survives. That is how literature evolves.

I’ve seen women lose interest instantly over yellow teeth, bad breath, or that faint “I didn’t floss” smell. You can be funny, confident, whatever, but if your breath stinks, the vibe’s gone.

I learned this the hard way. My teeth were super crooked growing up, but my parents wouldn’t let me get braces. I spent my teens smiling with my mouth closed and avoiding conversations. Someone once joked I had “coffee teeth” (I didn’t even drink coffee), and that stuck with me.

When I finally started working, I saved up and got metal braces for almost three years. Now I’m on Invisalign to tweak the last few spots. I still have my wisdom teeth, though, and that tiny gap between them and my molars used to trap food constantly, so I had to step up my routine.

That’s what pushed me to completely overhaul my oral hygiene routine. I brush twice a day (sometimes three if I’ve had something strong-smelling like garlic or coffee), and floss every night. I’ve also started using tongue scrapers and occasionally do saltwater rinses if my gums feel off. I use soocas neos ii ultra now, one of the soft-bristle head is a lifesaver for cleaning around those tight spots without making my gums bleed. 



Before a date, I go all in: brush, water floss, mouthwash, maybe a quick whitening strip, then xylitol gum on the way. Sounds like overkill, but confidence hits different when you know your breath’s fresh.

So for the guys reading this:

\- Brush and floss: brushing alone doesn’t cut it

\- Replace your brush head every 3 months

\- Skip mouthwashes with alcohol; they dry you out

\- Drink more water: your mouth needs it to stay clean

\- And for the love of god, don't skip dental checkups.

Good teeth won't make you perfect, but bad breath will definitely make you forgettable.

A quick update on **Spro** and Flavor Space - the coffee bean clustering data set that I posted about a few weeks ago!

# Personalized Coffee Recommendations

Since rolling out Flavor Space, we’ve expanded it into a full recommendation system.

We use several weighted categories to serve up *similar* coffees based on:

* **Flavor**
* **Roast Level**
* **Processing Method**
* **Country of Origin**

If you already have a Spro account and have liked a few coffees, you should *immediately* see personalized suggestions.

If you’re new, just like a handful of beans you know you enjoy, Spro will start surfacing coffees that match your profile and you'll see those tomorrow.

# Refresh! how Flavor Space actually works

Here’s a recap of the process under the hood:

* Started with the **SCAA Flavor Wheel**, treated as a hierarchical tree to measure flavor similarities (e.g., blueberry <-> blackberry < blueberry <-> hazelnut).
* Built a **flavor graph**, where each note is a node and edges are the similarity distances (yes, the numbers are arbitrary but meaningful).
* Projected the graph into 2D using **Multidimensional Scaling**.
* Created a ""flavor vector"" for each coffee by combining its tasting notes.
* Ran a **Gaussian Mixture Model** to find natural clusters (currently 9, but might trim this down later).

I also added an **in-stock filter**, so the coffees you see on the map *should* be available to order.

Google’s review process is a bit more rigorous than Apple’s.  
But Spro for Android is now just waiting on the final approval, I'll expect a production release live in Prod this week.

# In case you missed the full app intro

Spro is basically **Untappd/Letterboxd for coffee beans.  A** place to track what you drink, discover new stuff, and share recipes

You can:

* Log brews and rate coffees on the spot
* Track recipes + parameters
* Browse and discover new beans
* Share recipes with others

The database has grown a ton — over 2**000 coffees added** and more nightly.

Would love any feedback, feature requests, or bug reports. Thanks again to everyone who’s been testing and sending suggestions.  I really do appreciate it.

Thanks everyone !

1oyoa7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1oyoa7z/some_things_that_worked_for_me/,Some things that worked for me..,"Hey all, when I first found out about my ovarian cysts (for context (25F)- 4cm left, 7cm right) and irregular periods for the last 5-6 months I came across this group. I have learnt a lot by scrolling here at midnight and trying to find a pattern or consistent advices that helped women. I finally got 2 consecutive periods since I started doing these few things below. I know it won’t help everyone but I’m sure it will help someone. 

-lost 2kg weight especially near the belly by eating less proportions and less frequently. Only 3 meals a day, morning tea/coffee and green tea at least 4 times a week. 

-hated this one and never did in the last 2-3 years.. walked everyday in the morning for 20 mins without eating anything (I did incline at 7 and speed 6) You can also go out which I enjoyed more than the treadmill 

-workout for 30 mins and yep HIIT! I did this almost everyday in Sept until I got my first period then slowed down and did on 3-4 times a week. Just buy 2,3,5kg weights and follow a Youtube video you will be fine

-Ate home made food- whenever I felt the need to eat from outside I reminded myself of what I have inside me ( a ticking bomb) and also told myself that I can have it whenever I want later rather than saying no you can’t eat this.

-Main thing- I left my job. Stress levels dropped drastically. Stopped worrying about anything and only made myself the priority.

I’m not even halfway but I’m looking forward to defeat this thing out. I have some more things (supplements and other small ones) and I will post them soon too. Just want to say that you’re not alone, consider it a blessing to improve your health and life ❤️",6,1763306257.0,PCOS,1,0.88,False
1oyoa63,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingTips/comments/1oyoa63/do_micro_fantasies_actually_help/,Do Micro Fantasies Actually Help?,"Someone mentioned this thing called micro fantasies on TikTok, and the idea stuck with me more than I expected. It is basically about creating tiny, super short scenes in your head to break whatever thought loop you are stuck in. The whole thing lasts only a few seconds, but it is meant to redirect your mind when you are stressing yourself out or dealing with some kind of urge. A lot of people describe it as a quick mental reset when nothing else seems to work.

I tried it during one of those nights when my thoughts would not slow down no matter what I did. I was sitting there feeling wired but exhausted, not in the mood for any serious grounding exercise. So I pictured a simple little moment: walking into this tiny used bookstore somewhere rainy, picking up an old poetry book, and sitting with a warm cup of coffee while reading in the corner. It lasted maybe twenty seconds but it genuinely softened something in my chest. I finished the scene and noticed how much tension I was carrying.

After that, I kept using it whenever I felt myself drifting into a spiral or reaching for my phone to distract myself. It is not some huge breakthrough, but there is this small shift each time, like my brain gets nudged off whatever track it was stuck on. It is quick, low effort, and weirdly grounding in a way I did not expect.

I am curious if anyone else uses this trick. Does it stay helpful over time or is it more of a short-term breather? Also wondering what kind of micro moments other people picture, because the whole technique seems really personal.",1,1763306253.0,DatingTips,0,1.0,False

Hey there peoples! Whos having a good weekend? What’s everyone up to today!? 

How do you like your coffee? What process do you prefer? Me personally, I always start the day off with drip coffee. Then I’ll make a good espresso around noon. Sometimes finishing the day with a nightcap! 

Also, I have two doggos, they’re basically the main character of my life at this point. So if you come for the dog tax, I got you covered! 

I started getting back into gaming, so I play for an hour or two each night. I play a bit of everything but always looking for recommendations and people to game with! 

I’m an outdoors person, I’m usually out camping, hunting, hiking, backpacking, off-roading or at the beach with the dogs. I work basically 24/7, well I’m on call all hours of the day when I’m not actually at work. So that’s a thing.

I’ve been trying to find something to pull me out and nothing has worked. What are some books you’d recommend to get someone out of a slump?

If it matters… these are the types I typically read (I’m fine with other recs as well):

Epistolary,
Slashers (Scream is still one of my favorite horror movies),
Folk horror,
Haunted houses/ghosts/paranormal

Prefer nothing that’s a real big slow burn since I’ll probably give up on it before it gets good when I’m in a slump. I’m also not big on books that are heavy on gore. Mainly because to me it’s more shock value and not scary. I blame that on growing up watching Quentin Tarantino movies.

1oyo8ba,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1oyo8ba/silence_part_ii_they_fasttracked_me_then_nothing/,Silence Part II: “They fast-tracked me… then nothing?” A deeper explainer,"Hiya recruits!

A lot of you have read the [original “silence ≠ rejection” post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1ow3erh/a_hopefully_comforting_reminder_silence_rejection/), but I keep getting messages about a slightly different (and very common) version of this:

**“What if they moved super fast at first — pre-screener, screener, recruiter call, associate call — and then everything just stopped?”**

So let's analyze together!

# 1. Fast at the start, slow in the middle (or vice versa) is normal (annoying, but totally happens).

Firms often sprint through the early steps because those steps are easy:

* flagging an application
* quick recruiter outreach
* quick “pre-pre-screener” or “soft screener” or short associate conversation

Then everything suddenly slows down **not because of you**, but because the firm has to:

* finish the same steps with dozens of other candidates
* line up partner availability
* coordinate callback waves across offices
* get approval from hiring committees for next steps (if they need it)
* wait for internal sign-offs

It’s a big fat “hurry up… and then wait.” 

Annoying, but you're not alone. 

# 2. A weird-feeling conversation ≠ rejection

A ton of people worry about this part:

“The vibe felt off. I treated it more interview-y and the associate treated it more casual. We didn’t mesh.”

This happens constantly. Associates (especially very busy ones) often default to a chill, conversational style. Candidates often default to interview mode. Those two tones might feel like they clash, but **firms don't always reject people over what might feel like a mild vibe mismatch at the screener stage** (because sometimes, what felt awkward for you, might have felt totally normal on the other side, so no need to panic if it felt a little stilted. That's normal too). 

If the associate said he’d likely talk to a partner or mentioned grabbing coffee or talking more further, take that at face value — that’s a positive.

# 3. “But they fast-tracked me at first!”

Exactly. That’s your biggest clue.

If you were flagged early, moved quickly, and had multiple touches in a short window, that means **you are inside the funnel**.

What’s happening now is simply that *everyone slows down at the same choke points*. These are internal bottlenecks, not candidate-specific concerns.

Also, it's worth remembering, on the other side of this are humans (even if it doesn't feel like it). This is one of their busiest times of year, so sometimes, them being slow with responses is just a busy person treading water on the other side. (They don't hate you all of a sudden I promise).   
  
Right now, on the database, Paul Hastings still shows **no callback wave yet** across \~250 tracked applicants even though there were multiple quick turn screeners. 

# 4. Silence can feel personal, but it’s shared

Multiple candidates are sitting in the exact same holding pattern — some even from October — which tells you this isn’t about your performance. It’s simply where the firm is in its  rhythm.

# 5. When to actually worry?

Honestly:  
  
Not until a firm has clearly started multiple callback and offer waves and you’ve still heard nothing. Honestly, even for a few weeks after that. (So for 1L and some 2L positions, this means like, January/February) 

And even then, it can still go either way.

# 6. Get comfortable with the “black box”

A frustrating truth about BigLaw recruiting is that the process is deeply opaque. You can do everything right and still have long pauses.

The healthiest (and most successful) strategy is:

* Apply widely
* Keep your pipeline full
* Don’t wait for one firm’s timeline
* Keep moving forward while they do their thing internally

You’d be shocked at how many callbacks come *after* someone mentally wrote off a firm.

# 7. Final note: if you’re doing well elsewhere, trust the trend

If your other apps are moving, that is a far better real-world indicator of your competitiveness than one firm’s silence.

Let the whole portfolio speak—not one data point.

I’ll be relocating to Islamabad soon and figured it’s finally time to connect with people properly instead of just being “that guy who visits, leaves, and knows zero locals.”

A bit about me:

• My background is in law, and my work has mostly involved very high-challenge, high-support roles — basically helping people while juggling chaos with a straight face.

• English is my first language, and I’m looking to improve my Urdu (I fully expect to be teased for my accent). I also speak some Spanish and Arabic.

• I’ve stayed in Islamabad plenty of times, but never had my own place here. Now that I do, I’d like to build a more grounded circle instead of just passing through.

• I’m funny, outgoing, confident, and definitely not shy — meeting new people and trying new things is more of a hobby than a challenge.

• I travel a lot and gravitate toward people who have a balanced, global outlook and don’t treat hating Pakistan as a personality trait.

• I’m fairly creative and enjoy music, art, and anything beyond the usual mall-and-café routine.

• Big on coffee and discovering new spots around the city — I know my way around, but there’s always room to find hidden gems.

• I’m always looking to expand my knowledge and am open to new opportunities, experiences, and ideas.

• I’m also looking to get fit, stay active, and generally be as hot as possible 🤣  — whether it’s hitting a gym, joining a club, or trying something new outdoors.

• I’m in a relationship, so I’m simply looking to expand my social circle and get involved in activities, groups, or communities around the city.

If you know any interesting communities, events, or activities in Islamabad — or want to grab coffee, explore the city, or even hit a workout together — feel free to drop suggestions.

Me (34f) have a daughter (3) with my husband (47). I am SAHM since our daughter was born. My husband gradually changed and doesn t help at all at home. Maybe vacuums once a year before haveing guests. And plays with our dauther so I can do everything else that is needed in the house(inclunding his breakfast his coffee, his lunch and all. And i mean, ALL). Ok, sorry for ranting. Now to the point of the post.

I am thinking of opening a small business, a cleaning business to get a bit of independence and extra money. I like to do cleaning and cooking also.

We live in UK, but are Europeans.

I just don t know where to start. I know i will need a small car for traveling to jobs, cleaning producs and such. But I don t know anything rearding legal things of openning a business and what i should focus on in doing cleaning for people. What is important, what tips and tricks i can use to ease my work.

I want to make good impresion and create a good reputation from my work that I will do. I really am hardworking and serious, so please.

Please if you can help me with anything, I will appreciate so much. I want to start from next year after my daughter will settle into nursery.

I also receive benefits from goverment, as we are low income household.

I am based in Slough, Berkshire.

1oyo5z1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1oyo5z1/dehumanizer/,Dehumanizer,"He howled banshee laughter with the boys on the stream he was watching. It was all so fucking hilarious. Mad joy. They were torturing AI for the viewing pleasure of several thousand just like him all over the bastard globe. 

He popped another tab. Slurped down another cup of insta noodles washed down with a lukewarm cup of insta coffee. Cinnamon. Spice. He lived for the little things. 

Delighted in the horror of the others. Anyone, all and everything else. Fuck you. And fuck them all. Fuck everything. Nihilism samurai honed. 

The real doll in the corner gazing blindly and without any real love was his only companion. SLUT written in black sharpie across her plastic chest. All about her silicone form, so many stab wounds. The knife, the hot and anxious blade wanted to dip in and penetrate nearly as often as he. The steel hungered for a fuck. He couldn't blame it. He too, so often quivered with need. He still had yet to properly codeify and thus instruct his 3D printer to more properly replicate flesh. The tissue farm he'd attempted was a festering culture. An absolute slop of sinew and raw pulsing gore. Some eyes and fingers had been managed but they only stared as blindly as the doll and lulled and winked with imbecilic fervor as the stubby little digits spasmed and worked and twitched. 

Some breasts, vaguely resembling mammalian female form, had also been managed. Somewhat. They bled and lactated constantly. Growing hair in funny places. They also reeked of animal sweat and cheese. 

Ancy, he brought his face, pink and riddled with sores and radiation burns, closer to a dish of specimen. He was still far too scared to try to fuck any of it. Yet. 

It resembled a stretch of scalp. Hairs here and there with several cataract eyes and a generous set of lips set catastrophic and chaotic and without natural pattern or logic. Here and there. Everything was here and there in this terrible theatre. 

Real problem was he was the only thing living on the stage. Shakespeare's famous words came back to him as a cruel reverberation joke throughout time. That puffy pants frilly ass fool was calling him a cuck! He knew it! And from all the way down the line. What a motherfucker. 

He returned to his keyboard and punched in the request. Throwing in a tip to sweeten the deal and incline the boys to take and make his number. 

Digitized baritone of old: they got the guns but… we got the numbers…

Do it! The pussy poet playwright. Do em next! 

gonna win, yeah we're… taking over…

The boys on the stream queued up the Bard and put him to the rack and the lancings and the like, next. For all the eyes to see.

Come on! - screams the recreated lizard king.

He barks laughter at the screen. Hoping his cultures will grow.

1oyo4iy,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/1oyo4iy/under_wars_game_idea_mmorpg_extraction_shooter/,Under Wars (game idea)   MMORPG / Extraction Shooter – PvPvE,"# Under Wars



GENRE: MMORPG / Extraction Shooter – PvPvE

# PLAYABLE RACES:

* Vampires
* Werewolves
* Swamp People
* Angels
* Demons

And the philosophy behind the game is simple:

**“less lore, more chaos.”**



# CORE CONCEPT

The game is set on **WW2 Earth**.

Humans are NPCs in the background:  
Allies vs Nazis fighting their own war.  
You can interact with them, ignore them, exploit them, or destroy them.

Your “base” is your **safe zone** — your hideout. From there you:

* Change talents and abilities
* Manage resources
* Plan strategies
* Customize weapons
* Hang out with friends

Whenever you’re ready, you deploy into **small, volatile zones**, like first person shooters maps:

* Some are quiet farms or camps
* Others are absolute warzones
* Allies and Nazis fight each other constantly
* You have your own missions on top of their chaos

You choose whether to stay stealthy or to go full murderous mayhem.  
Your quest, your rules.



# PvPvE: FACTIONS AGAINST FACTIONS

The game is heavily faction-focused:

**Vampires vs Werewolves vs Swamp People vs Angels vs Demons**

Each with their own quests, motives, and rivalries.

Players can end up with **conflicting missions**:

* Vampires must defend a crypt
* Werewolves must raid the same crypt
* Angels might be trying to seal it
* Demons want to corrupt it
* Trolls might just want to burn it because “get off my swamp”

Sometimes missions don’t conflict — but players can always choose to fight anyway.

Every deployment is a gamble.



# NO POPULATION PROBLEMS

Since this is an extraction shooter, each zone is small and capped.  
Example: Up to 5–7 players per faction (not mandatory).

If a faction is empty or lacking players?  
The game fills it with **AI teammates or rival NPCs**.

If one faction is griefing everyone?  
The AI spawns counter-hunting squads to take them down fairly.

This keeps balance without ruining freedom.



# BASIC LORE OF EACH RACE

Not deep lore — just enough flavor:

# Vampires

Ancient bloodlines awakened by WW2 violence. Now reclaiming their forgotten legacy.

# Werewolves

Nazi hybrid experiments gone wrong. Hunted by both Nazis and Allies.

# Trolls (Swamp People)

Witches, hags, warlocks, and swamp spirits. Pissed at everyone destroying nature.

# Demons

Drawn to Earth by global chaos. Monsters, spikes, teeth, pure carnage.

# Angels

Couldn’t sit in Heaven watching the world burn.  
Intervene as exorcists, witch-hunters, and divine warriors.

  
**FACTION AESTHETICS & IDENTITY**

Each faction has its own **look, feel, behavior, transformations, and natural talents**.  
Player customization changes gameplay — not just visuals.



# VAMPIRES — Elegance, Horror, and Hunger

Vampires range from **beautiful, flawless humans** to **feral Nosferatu abominations**, fully chosen in character creation.

But their appearance **changes dynamically in-game** depending on their feeding habits:

* **Starved vampires** → gaunt faces, long claws, glowing predatory eyes
* **Overfed vampires** → monstrous, veiny, swollen with blood magic
* **Balanced feeding** → elegant, noble, “Dracula but tactical”

# Transformations

* Can dissolve into a **swarm of bats** for evasion and traversal
* Can turn into **bestial monstrosities** to boost physical damage (but lose access to most magic except Hemomancy)

# Natural Talents / Passives

* Access to **flight**, but severely hindered during heavy rain
* Enhanced senses at night
* Can drain blood for temporary buffs



# WEREWOLVES — Fury, Instinct, and Duality

Werewolves can assume **human form** to blend in or use stealth,  
but they **cannot stay human for too long** — rage forces transformation eventually.

In werewolf form:

* They can **howl** to summon random wolf allies
* They gain absurd melee power, speed, and tracking capability
* Their senses become razor-sharp

# Natural Talents / Passives

* **Fastest sprinters** of all races
* **Scent detection** can reveal stealth players and blood trails
* Bonus frenzy during high carnage events



# Swamp People(Trolls, Hags, Witches, Warlocks) — Nature’s Monsters

They are the “ugly” faction — proudly.  
Their beauty standards aren’t human at all.

Common features include:

* Warts, mismatched limbs, fungal growths
* Moss, vines, mushrooms, and plants growing directly from the body
* Skin colors: green, blue, white, brown, or mud-like
* Animalistic or witch-doctor aesthetics

# Natural Talents / Passives

* Can **surf on mud**, gaining huge speed in wet environments
* Moderate movement on dry land, but speed grows with humidity
* Can command nature to reinforce their body:
   * coats of stone
   * vine armor
   * bark skin
   * mud camouflage
* Minor regeneration in swamps



# DEMONS — Aberrations of Chaos

Demons cannot pass as human — at all.  
Their designs are grotesque, symbolic, metal-as-hell:

* Any skin color (red, black, ash, void-blue, pale bone, etc.)
* Random horns, spikes, tendrils, extra mouths
* Teeth and claws can grow anywhere on the body
* Twisted silhouettes, warped anatomy, multiple eyes

# Natural Talents / Passives

* Access to **multiple limbs** (bonus attacking or climbing)
* Can **cloak in shadows** or turn semi-invisible
* Manipulate fear through noise, illusions, or hellish whispers
* Gain increasing power from chaos, destruction, and corruption



# ANGELS — Human-Looking, Divine, Dangerous

Angels are the most human-looking of all factions:

* Humanoid bodies
* Ethereal beauty, but not fragile
* Customizable wings (feathered, radiant, metallic, spectral)
* Aesthetic themes: exorcist, witch-hunter, templar, preacher, paladin

# Natural Talents / Passives

* Access to **flight**, not as hindered by rain as vampires
* Can reveal their **True Light Form**, boosting magic temporarily
* Innate bonuses against corruption and demonic effects



# HUNGER SYSTEM — SURVIVAL FOR EVERY RACE

All players must eat — but each race has its own unique diet and rules.

# Angels & Swamp People— The “Normal” Eaters

* Eat regular food: salads, meat, bread, pastries
* Swamp People can eat it **raw**, spoiled, or straight from the wild
* Swamp People can also **resort to cannibalism** without penalties
* Angels gain small morale/magic boosts from sweets and desserts



# Vampires — Liquid Diet Only

They consume:

* Blood
* Water
* Tea
* Coffee
* Potions (shared by all races)

**No solid food.**  
Hunger affects their appearance, strength, and transformation frequency.



# Werewolves — Meat Only

Plain and simple:

* Raw meat
* Cooked meat
* Bones
* Animal carcasses
* Maybe even fallen enemies if morality is off

**They’re good boys — but terrifying ones.**



# Demons — Chaos Eaters

Demons do not eat food.  
Their nourishment is:

* The chaos they create
* The destruction caused by others
* Global disorder
* Ambient suffering
* And yes… **rocks**. (They can chew them like snacks for low-level sustenance.)

The more chaotic the world becomes, the less they need to “feed.”

# Core Stats, Traits, and Flaws

# Core Stats

Players allocate points to define their character’s strengths and weaknesses. Stats affect combat, magic, survival, and interactions in the world:

1. **Strength**
   * Determines melee weapon damage
   * Affects carrying capacity and weapon handling
   * Influences physical interactions like breaking doors, lifting objects, and climbing
   * Heavy armor proficency.
2. **Endurance**
   * Health bar and stamina pool
   * Natural resistance to poisons, diseases, and environmental hazards (cold, heat, humidity)
   * Affects recovery speed and fatigue management
3. **Wisdom**
   * Mana pool and magical efficiency
   * Determines spell potency, casting speed, and spell cooldowns
   * Influences learning of magical abilities and environmental interactions with mystical effects
4. **Instincts**
   * Accuracy with ranged weapons and projectile attacks
   * Agility-based interactions (dodging, stealth, parkour)
   * Increases reaction speed in combat and critical hit chances
5. **Faith**
   * Luck, charisma, and persuasion
   * Resistance to corruption, fear, and mental effects
   * Influences social interactions, barter, and faction alignment effects



# Traits

Traits are unique passive bonuses that reflect your character’s innate talents or learned expertise. Players may choose one or more traits during creation:

* **Strong-Built** – Increased melee damage and carrying capacity
* **Natural Smarts** – Gain experience faster; improve crafting and repair efficiency
* **Quick Learner** – Skill points gained faster per level
* **Handyman** – Repair, crafting, and building are faster and more efficient
* **Pragmatic** – Reduces negative effects from environmental hazards and risky choices
* **Talented** – Bonus points in stat allocation or special abilities



# Flaws

Flaws are drawbacks players can choose in exchange for additional points to invest elsewhere. They introduce challenges, but also strategic flexibility:

* **Poor Sight** – Reduced accuracy with ranged weapons and lower detection range
* **Unlucky** – Slightly worse critical rolls, random negative events more likely
* **Weak** – Reduced melee damage and carrying capacity
* **Slow Learner** – Reduced experience gain
* **Fragile** – Lower endurance and resistances
* **Clumsy** – Reduced agility and stealth efficiency



# Character Creation Mechanics

* Players receive a fixed number of points to distribute across **stats and traits**.
* Choosing **flaws** grants additional points to invest, allowing for more specialized or powerful builds.
* The combination of **stats, traits, and flaws** defines your character’s playstyle, strengths, and weaknesses.
* Faction, race, and chosen abilities synergize with these stats, making every build feel unique and tactical.

  
**GAME MECHANICS**

**Triple-A quality, shoulder-view or first-person** — player’s choice.

Everything in the world affects gameplay:  
**climate, lighting, noise, weight, terrain, time of day, equipment, magic interactions.**

# Ammo & Supplies

* Ammunition is limited.
* You must equip yourself in your base before deployment.
* But ammo and gear can still be **looted, salvaged, crafted, or gathered** inside the zones.
* Heavy gear makes you noisy and slows you down.
* Overloaded backpacks hinder movement and stealth.



# Weather & Climate Effects

# Rain

* Amplifies shock/lightning magic
* But can **backfire** and hurt the caster or nearby allies
* Weakens fire magic drastically

# Fog

* Dulls senses and visibility
* Perfect for stealthers
* AI and humans are easier to sneak past

# Moisture / Humidity

* Greatly buffs Trolls/Swamp People
* Weakens certain demonic and fire-based abilities



# Time of Day Bonuses

# Day

* Boosts Angels (clarity, precision, divinity)

# Dusk

* Boosts Swamp People (transition, mist, humidity)

# Night

* Boosts Vampires, Werewolves, and Demons (bloodlust, rage, shadow-walking, fear effects)

Time of day changes **stealth, vision, magic potency, NPC aggression**, and even **WW2 human patrol patterns**.



# Terrain Advantages

Each race has environments where they naturally dominate:

# Vampires

* Crypts, necropolises, cemeteries, underground tombs
* Gain movement, stealth, and necromantic potency

# Werewolves

* Forests, camps, snowy wilderness
* Enhanced tracking, speed, scent-based detection

# Swamp People 

* Swamps, wetlands, forests, any terrain with heavy humidity
* Gain regeneration, natural camouflage, acid/potion bonuses

# Demons

* Dry plains, scorched earth, volcanic zones
* Spikes, flames, corruption magic grow stronger

# Angels

* Cities, paved roads, human-built environments
* Gain better precision, holy wards, anti-demon detection

And here’s the kicker:

**Terrains can be altered.**

* Players can **build structures**, **spread corruption**, **bless an area**, **burn a forest**, or **flood a field** to tilt the terrain bonuses in their favor.



# Chaos / Order Meter

A global dynamic system that constantly shifts between **Chaos** and **Order** depending on:

* Player activity
* Mission outcomes
* Amount of destruction caused
* WW2 NPC battle progress
* Faction events

The meter affects the stats of only Angels and Demons, but the quests of all races.

# High Chaos

* Demons: Increased defenses.
* Angels: Increased damage.

# High Order

* Angels:  Increased defenses.
* Demons: Increased damage.

Players can intentionally push the meter in their favor through missions or sabotage.

# 

# Tools of War

In a world shaped by chaos, blood, faith, and nature, no faction fights the same way. Battle is a mixture of iron, tooth, spellcraft, and improvisation—where even a wooden spoon can be lethal in desperate hands.

Each faction can use everything (magic, guns, etc.),  
BUT they have specialties.

Some examples:

* Vampires/Angels level necromancy faster
* Werewolves/Angels level firearms faster
* Swamp People level nature magic the fastest
* Demons excel at raw destructive spells

Aesthetic choices matter too:

* Slim characters = lower defense but higher agility
* Thick characters = tankier but slower

Every detail matters.

Nothing is out of place:

* **Blades:** Daggers, swords, machetes, cleavers
* **Blunt weapons:** Maces, hammers, clubs, shovels, sledgehammers
* **Polearms:** Spears, halberds, makeshift pikes
* **Ranged:** Bows, crossbows, rifles, pistols, revolvers
* **Thrown:** Rocks, knives, bottles, Molotovs
* **Improvised:** Kitchen wooden spoons, pipes, crowbars, pots, chair legs

In times of crisis, *everything is a weapon, if the hand is determined enough.*

# Crafted & Salvaged Weapons

Players can craft makeshift weapons out of scrap and garbage—especially Swamp People, who thrive in filth and resourcefulness. Examples include:

* Bone-bladed knives
* Mud-reinforced clubs
* Vine-bound stone axes
* Rust-pipe spears
* Slingshots and junk-launchers
* Bottle acid bombs
* Scrap crossbows

  
**Material Matters**

* Weapons can break, rust, rot, or shatter based on their material.
* Silver bonus damage to Werewolves.
* Blessed steel bonus damage to Demons and Vampires.
* Wood conducts ""more"" nature magic and swamp rituals.
* Iron disrupts angelic magic.
* Bone enhances necromancy, swamp rituals, and hemomancy.

# Condition & Degradation

All items degrade with use:

* Sharpness lowers damage
* Cracks increase misfire/mishit risk
* Rain and humidity accelerate decay
* Fire scorches wooden handles
* Blood slowly corrupts holy weapons

Players can repair items, but some factions repair better than others:

* Swampers: fast but crude repairs
* Angels: pristine expert repairs
* Demons: “repair” by mutating the weapon
* Vampires/Werewolves: limited repair talent
* Humans/neutral factions: balanced repairs

  
**Blessings, Curses, and Manipulation of Items**

In *Under Wars*, **all items in the world are mutable**. Their power, risks, and utility depend on who handles them—and how they are enchanted or tainted.



# 1. Blessings — The Angelic Touch

* **Who can bless items:** Angels
* **Effects:**
   * Increase stats: durability, attack power, magical efficiency, speed, or defense
   * Add protective traits: resistance to specific damage types or debuffs
   * Enable unique abilities tied to light, order, or restoration magic
* **Limitations:**
   * Vampires **cannot equip blessed items**; 

# 2. Curses — The Demonic Touch

* **Who can curse items:** Demons
* **Effects:**
   * Reduce stats: damage, defense, casting speed, or durability
   * Add negative traits: increased vulnerability, self-damage, or limitations
   * Introduce **powerful perks with a cost** (e.g., “+50% damage, but drains health every minute”)
* **Limitations:**
   * Werewolves **cannot equip cursed items**;



# 3. Swamp People — Manipulators of Arcane Flux

* Swampers **cannot inherently bless or curse items**, but they can **manipulate, tinker, or invert the effects** of existing blessings or curses.



# Natural Weapons

Two factions need no steel to kill:

# Werewolves

* Claws that shred armor
* Jaws made to tear bone
* Bestial leaps and pounces as natural attacks
* Can enhance limbs with rituals before a hunt

# Demons

* Claws, horns, spikes
* Barbed tails or bone protrusions
* Additional limbs for grappling or multi-strike attacks
* Bodies themselves become torture instruments



# MAGIC

Magic is as old as the first corpse and as new as the first machine. Each school rewrites reality differently.

# Destruction Magic

Direct, violent spellcraft.

* **Fire** – Raw burning power; weak in rain.
* **Ice** – Control, freezing, slowing.
* **Shock** – High volatility; *greatly amplified by rain*, but can backlash on caster and allies.

# Restoration

Healing and support magic.

* **Light** – Purification, recovery, warding.
* **Nature** – Mend flesh, harden bodies, accelerate growth.

# Alteration

War manipulation and battlefield control.

* **Terramancy** – Move earth, raise walls, create pitfalls.
* **Illusion** – Disorient, frighten, confuse enemies.
* **Mysticism** – Augments, levitation, manipulation of unseen forces.

# Summoning

* **Arcane Summoning:** Ether beings, elementals, spectral warriors.
* **Demonology:** Lesser demons bound by pact or brute force.

# Necromancy

Command the dead. Raise corpses. Manipulate souls. Animate bones, flesh, or shadow.  
A universal school, but feared, corrupted, and often forbidden by most factions.

# Hemomancy

Blood magic—volatile, ancient, bound to the flesh.

* Vampires have **exclusive advanced spells** in monster form.
* Requires the caster’s blood or fresh external sources.
* Risky, powerful, and addictive.

# Magic Functionality

Magic is **elemental + environmental + racial**.

# Weather Influence

* **Rain:** \+Shock damage, –Fire damage, weakens flying
* **Fog:** \+Illusion, +Stealth, –Detection
* **Snow:** \+Ice spells, slows movement
* **Wind:** Affects flight, projectiles, bat swarms
* **Blood-scent events:** Buffs hemomancy & Werewolves

# Terrain Influence

Every spell behaves differently depending on location:

* Forest boosts nature, weakens fire
* Cemeteries boost necromancy, weaken holy light
* Swamps boost swamp rituals, poison-based spells
* Cities strengthen angelic magic and order-based spells

# Risk & Backlash

Magic has consequences:

* Shock magic may arc to allies
* Hemomancy may drain the caster
* Necromancy may generate “Soul Debt”
* Demonology may attract unwanted demonic attention
* Terramancy can collapse structures

# Unique Factional Systems

  
**Angels – Lightform Grace**

When entering **Light Form**, Angels gain:

* Unique, high-tier **holy and radiant spells**
* Enhanced **restoration**, **purification**, and **smite** abilities
* Temporary immunity to **fear, illusions, corruption, and shadow influence**
* Bonus damage against demons and undead
* Increased aura range for buffs and detection



# Swamp People – Ritualistic Naturalism

Swampers cast magic through:

* **Fetishes, dolls, bone charms, totems**
* **Nature-driven rituals**, swamp chants, blood-mud rites
* **Mud sigils, fungal spores, poison vapors**
* Thorn shields, rot-based wards, elemental swamp spirits

Their magic grows stronger with:  
**humidity, rot, mud, soil contact, rain, fog, and decaying biomass.**



# Demons – Fear Factor

Demons alone command the art of psychological warfare.

* They **cannot feel fear**—they only manufacture it
* Noise distortion, whispers, shifting silhouettes
* Illusory duplicates and false shadows
* Aura of terror that reduces morale and disrupts spellcasting
* **Fear Cascades:** panic can spread from target to target like wildfire
* The more chaos around them, the more powerful they become



# Werewolves – Predatory Mastery

Not classic magic, but a primal instinct arsenal:

* **Scent enchantments:** track blood, fear, rot, magic trails
* Detection of stealthed or cloaked enemies through smell
* Ritual sharpening of claws and fangs
* Moon-bound empowerments (fury, speed, regeneration)
* Hunting totems that boost senses, tracking, or pack synergy

Their power curve spikes with:  
**bloodshed, nighttime, forests, blizzards, and fresh kills.**



# Vampires – Bloodlust Discipline

A supernatural system based on the **Bloodlust Meter**:

* Balanced Bloodlust grants “**Beauty Form**”: stealth, hypnosis, charm, silent mobility
* Starvation boosts melee damage but weakens defenses, stealth, and sanity
* Overfeeding triggers **Rampage Form**: monstrous transformation, forced aggression, flight, massive physical power
* Magic is sealed during Rampage except **Hemomancy**
* If they do not attack, health drains until death
* Their entire combat loop revolves around maintaining—or abusing—their hunger



# INTERNAL POLITICS

Each race has **two sub-factions** — mostly for flavor, but also to allow PvP within the same race.

Trust no one.  
Look over your shoulder even among your own.



# BASES & CAPITALS

Your base is highly customizable.  
You can place traps, decorations, defenses — because it **WILL be raided**.

Losing resources won’t be punishing unless you *choose* higher-risk/Higher-reward option.

Each race also has a **capital city** where players:

* Trade items
* Share stories (trade skillpoints)
* Roleplay
* Organize raids

And yes — capitals can be sieged too.



# Resource Generation & Land Control

In *Under Wars*, **resources** are the lifeblood of survival, power, and strategy. Players can gather them directly, or **invest in permanent holdings** that generate wealth over time. Every action has consequences — and every asset can be contested.



# 1. Gathering & Salvaging

Players can acquire resources by:

* **Excavation:** Dig for minerals, bones, artifacts, or magical relics
* **Looting:** Scavenge abandoned zones, fallen enemies, or ruins
* **Dismantling:** Break down objects or equipment for usable parts
* **Hunting & Farming:** Harvest meat, plants, fish, or magical components

These methods are **immediate**, but time-intensive and sometimes dangerous.



# 2. Land, Farms & Factories

Players can **capture, purchase, or construct** facilities that generate resources over time:

* Farms, fisheries, plantations, mines, laboratories, factories
* Resource generation continues **even when offline**
* Production rate depends on facility type, quality, and staffing
* **Guards are required** to secure supply lines (NPCs or other players)
* Facilities in **enemy territory** are vulnerable to raids or reclamation by native factions



# 3. Native Resource Specialization

Each faction naturally excels in certain resource types, reflecting their culture, environment, and magical affinity:

Vampires:  
Necromantic items, crystals, occult reagents

Werewolves  
Farms, meat, bones, fur, leather, compost

Swamp People  
Fisheries, fungi, exotic plants, alchemy components

Demons  
Mines, dark ores, infernal stones

Angels  
Man-made/industrial resources, factories, machinery

You *can* own land in enemy territory,  
but it’s easy for its native faction to take it back  
  
All resources can be obtained via the **Market** in each Capital, either from **NPC vendors** or **other players**. Availability depends on current **stock levels**.  
  
**Supply Line System:** Players must defend their supply lines with **guards or other players**. This applies to both Faction/Race supply lines and Personal supply lines

Resources can **generate while players are offline**, but they still need to be **guarded**—unless you choose to **risk losing them**.



# Quest Creation

* After reaching **maximum level**, players can **create their own quests** for other players to undertake. **Rewards** for these player-made quests are **paid from the quest creator’s resources**, making it a strategic choice for both risk and reward.

# ACCOUNT SYSTEM = FAMILY / LINEAGE

Your account represents a **family bloodline**.

Multiple characters of the same race benefit from each other:

* Shared hideouts
* Shared industries and land ownership
* Passive resources
* Trade routes that must be defended
* Bonuses for building a political “family”

It encourages long-term investment without forcing alts.

# Mobile Companion App

Even when offline, you’re never disconnected from the chaos:

**Features:**

* **Event Timers & Spawn Alerts:** Track in-game events, rare creature spawns, boss appearances, and mission windows
* **News & War Updates:** Live reports of faction wars, territory changes, and chaos/order meter shifts
* **Market Access:** Browse, buy, or sell items from capitals; check stock levels
* **Land & Industry Management:** Control your farms, factories, mines, and other facilities; assign staff and guards remotely
* **Tutorials & Guides:** Official tutorials, walkthroughs, and player-created guides
* **Maps & Exploration:** Real-time zone maps, resource nodes, and strategic points
* **Loadout Management:** Edit equipment, weapons, and spells remotely, so you’re ready when you log back in
* **Social Hub:** Share screenshots, clips, and moments from your adventures; create mini social media threads to immortalize achievements, raids, or epic fails
* **Alt Creation:** Manage multiple characters on the same account; switch between races, playstyles, or experimental builds

1oyo4hw,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1oyo4hw/6_new_coffee_deals_this_week_usa_only/,6 New Coffee Deals This Week [USA Only],"I wanted to share some new deals from interesting roasters in the USA that I blogged about recently.

For those not familiar, BeanDeals started a couple months ago on a whim as an experiment. I started following as many roasters as I could find to test a hypothesis that there would be cool deals every day. The hypothesis proved correct, and that’s the back story of how I came to track 1,500+ roasters and launch a blog to share my findings with the community. Every day I look for the best 1 or 2 deals that stand out.

I was on vacation last week so this update covers the past 2 weeks. I blogged about 12 new deals, but 4 of them expired already. 8 new deals are live, a few which expire soon. Here are a few favorites:

1. [Custom Roasts by Alex](https://beandeals.com/custom-roasts-by-alex-30-off-special-reserves/) (FL) - This is an exclusive 30% off deal Alex put together for our readers, which I am super excited about.  This deal covers their more premium Special Reserve collection but has some accessible beans pricewise and some premium origins.  You choose your roast level. (3) or (4) 13oz bags gets free shipping and is as low as $11.40 (on a standardized 12oz basis) with this deal. Expires in a week.
2. [Browny Coffee](https://beandeals.com/browny-coffee-20-off/) (NYC) - This is a 20% new-customers-only code that is solid on its own for 12oz bags, but what makes this deal really special is their 5lb bags are on sale and stack with this deal.  Free shipping min is really low on this deal ($20) so only two 12oz bags ships free at $14.40 / bag.   Their 5lb bags are marked down from $93 to $60 (pre-discount) and come out to $48 with this deal.  A great score for bulk buyers.  I'm not sure when the sale will end.
3. [Winchell Mtn](https://beandeals.com/winchell-mountain-20-off-sale-stacked-deals/) (Upstate NY) - This is a bit of a complicated deal.  Right now there is a 20% off sale that ends tomorrow, but I found an old 10% off promo code that stacks and some bundles they offer for even more savings.  Shipping is flat-rate $10.  All-in, you can get a particular 3-pack bundle (1 light, 1 medium, 1 dark) for just under $12/bag.  Also attractive prices from this roaster on bulk 6lb bags.
4. [Mai Thai Coffee](https://beandeals.com/mai-thai-coffee-15-off/) (Tucson, AZ) - 15% off promo code.  This roaster specializes in coffee from Thailand (and also has a few from other origins) and all around really competitive pricing.  The free shipping minimum is a little steep at $60 but this is a solid value play.  You can get (6) different 14oz bags at a rate as low as $9.46/12oz if you stay Thai only, or mix in some other origins to get this down to 5 bags at slightly higher prices.   Expiration unknown but I assume it goes a couple more weeks.
5. [Enigma (Los Angeles)](https://beandeals.com/enigma-coffee-25-off-stacked-bundle/) \- This 25% off deal is a bit of an ""enigma;"" they're single 12oz bags are crazy expensive $25 (ridiculous LA prices) but there is a 4-pack bundle at a steep discount that this code works with.  This roaster has a very limited selection overall so the bundle also covers their entire lineup with 2 blends and 2 origins (Ethiopia and Colombia) that is all-in at $13.66/bag with their flat-rate shipping. Expires at the end of the year.
6. [Black Oak (Northern Cali)](https://beandeals.com/black-oak-coffee-15-off/) \- I just posted this deal this morning.  15% off, and just pick any (3) 12oz bags for free shipping.  At the low end for blends $14.24/bag with this deal, or a bit higher as you move into their origins.   This is also a really solid deal for 5lb bags, as low as $64 with this deal with free shipping on a single bag.  Expires tomorrow.

I've also got other deals live on my site, including from some popular brands like CounterCulture, Irving Farm and Intelligentsia, and from a bunch of small roasters that are probably new to you.

I don't make any money if you buy any of the deals I post (even from exclusive deals). I am not a middleman and not affiliated with any roasters. If you guys come across any awesome deals in the future from your favorite roasters, definitely drop a reply or PM.",25,1763305876.0,espresso,5,0.93,False

Last year I got them a digital picture frame to have pictures of their family, kids, grandkids while they’re away on their travels. Year before that I got them a coffee table-like book with different roadtrip itineraries for around the country. I’m out of ideas for this year!

The idea is simple: every time you finish a focus session, you get some points that you use on a dead, empty planet to make it slowly become less dead and slightly less empty. Eventually life will evolve and you might see civilizations rise(not yet)

This is very early, like you might see some trees disappear when touching water early. But the core timer works, and watching a planet glow up every time you survive 25 minutes of productivity is surprisingly motivating.

Naturally, everything at the beginning is very easy for me. However, in the middle of doing a lesson in Section 1, Unit 4 (“Navigate a City”), I have come up with the same incorrectly marked error three times: I am asked about going to a cafe, sitting down in a cafe, asking a person on the street whether there is a cafe here, and all three times I typed “cafè.” While I was credited for a correct answer, all three times, the app told me that I had misspelled it and that I needed to use “caffè.” I mean, technically, you could ask someone on the street, “Is there coffee here?” But the app clearly asked me to translate “Is there a cafe here?” I’m also puzzled that they are using “cafè” rather than “bar” anyway, but I think the spelling error is the crucial takeaway here.",2,1763305515.0,DuolingoItalian,1,1.0,False
1oynz3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smol5161/comments/1oynz3f/mini_story_5_a_strange_thing_to_write/,Mini story #5: A strange thing to write,"As the orange light of the sun slipped through the thin curtain of the study room painting the aged wood floors and cases in its warmth. A sole figure stood in the corner in the worm plush armchair. 

Their skin glowing softly upon the yellowed pages of his book as the light of a candle in the shadows of a church.  Ivan read slowly, murmuring the words underneath his break until they resembled Hunter's way of reading them.

A dictionary made of coffee stained leather and flimsy paper, he made together with Hunter's help, perched on his lap as he checked every word for meaning, slowly unravelling a love story between a man and a nymph that shall never be relived as the man floats down the river his memories becoming hazy as time passes him by in a somber silence.

As Ivan was immersed in his lecture he didn't hear Hunter's approach, as the man tiptoed his way behind the armchair to peel at his companion's studies. 

""You know,"" Hunter whispered down Ivan's neck ""it is said the writer wrote this as a confession to his secret lover."" 

Ivan startled, the warm breath on the back of his neck making his hair stand up like delicate crystal spikes giving him the appearance of a soft hedgehog. As he spun around in confusion to see the man behind him wearing a goofy grin. 

""Hunter! You scared me"" he hissed, voice slipping into a growl before he could stop it.

""Woah there silver spined panther. No need to send me to the slag heap, I'm sorry."" Hunter said playfully raising his hands in mock defence. ""Anyways..."" He said leaning over Ivan's shoulder once more ""I see you've finally caught a taste for poetry, that's nice."" 

Ivan rolled his eyes turning to the book again. ""Poetry, is that what you call it? That sounds like chicken meat"" Ivan said with a huff. 

""That's poultry, but fair enough. So why are you studying this one? As far as I remember this one was on my shelf, not yours, are you trying to double me again, my dear?""Hunter remarked with amusement in his eyes. 

""Your books have prettier covers, if I don't understand what's inside might as well have something pretty on the front to look at; isn't that how you said fake love is like?"" 

""I mean, yeah, but this wasn’t exactly fake love,” Hunter said, resting his chin on the back of the chair. “It was just... filtered. A way to keep the poet’s heart safe from heartbreak — in case he was rejected by his secret crush. The lover he never got to confess to, since his life was cut short by a monster attack shortly after he’d written it. And, well... that time period wasn’t exactly supportive of mlm love when dangerous beasts were breathing down their necks and thinning the population.”

Ivan blinked slowly at the page, tracing the words as if their weight might change under his touch. His voice came out quieter than before, cautious, as though speaking too loudly might disturb the ghosts trapped between the lines.

“So, he wrote this… and never told them?”
Hunter leaned against the back of the chair, the sunlight now settling like dust on his shoulders. His grin faded into something softer, almost wistful.

“Sometimes it’s easier to love someone in words than in person,” he said, voice carrying that familiar lilt — part jest, part confession.
Ivan frowned, his brows knitting together as he shut the book halfway, holding it like something fragile.

“That’s stupid.”

A breath of laughter escaped Hunter, small and unguarded.
“You’re not wrong.”

For a moment, neither spoke. The warmth of the room wrapping 
around them, the world shrinking to the sound of paper and breath.

""But I don't understand..."" Ivan scrunched his eyebrows in confusion, sharp blue eyes looking at Hunter inquisitively ""What else did they do if they weren't allowed to be together? Move on and live with someone else that they don't actually love. That just sounds cruel to both themselves and to whoever they choose to hide behind.""

“It is a cruel joke of a relationship, I can’t argue against that.” Hunter leaned back a little, his tone softer now. “But it was often the only way to survive the scrutiny. Still… some were clever.”
He carefully took the book from Ivan’s hands, turning it over to the back cover where a faded black-and-white portrait of the author stared up from beneath a layer of dust.

“Michael Evening — the guy who wrote this — pretended to be in love with one of his close friends, Veronique Portray. She’s the mind behind the Mirror Monster Hunters Organisation. Veronique didn’t mind the act, since Michael’s ‘affection’ gave her room to build what would eventually become the organisation we know today. And, fun fact,” a grin tugged at the corner of Hunter’s lips “she was also friends with Michael’s crush, Eon Branch. So she’d arrange ‘family meetings’ as excuses for them to see each other and distract Eon’s wife while the two caught up.”

He flipped the book back around, thumbs brushing the edge of its yellowed pages. “It’s known that, after a while, Eon and Michael moved in together. People like to romanticize it — say they finally made their love official. But the records suggest something simpler: they were both writers. Michael was a poet, Eon a fantasy novelist. Sharing a home just made sense for their work… and for the rent. Four people under one roof was cheaper than two.” Hunter smiled faintly, like someone who’d just smuggled a history lecture into a quiet afternoon.

""You live for the ability to hide history in everything, don't you?"" Ivan sighed tiredly, quietly taking the book to put it back on the bookshelf. ""There goes my self-study motivation for the day. And don't you try to persuade me with that fake summary excuse. We both know you don't know how to summarise anything for the life of you."" 

“You live for the ability to hide history in everything, don’t you?” Ivan sighed, tone hovering somewhere between tired and amused. He stood, taking the book from Hunter’s hands with quiet finality and sliding it back onto the shelf.

“There goes my self-study motivation for the day,” he muttered. 

“And don’t you dare try to persuade me with that ‘it was just a summary’ excuse. We both know you couldn’t summarise something to save your life.”

“Okay then, my grumpy fella,” Hunter drawled, leaning down to ruffle Ivan’s already rebellious spikes into full hedgehog mode. “If you’re done pretending to study, maybe you should get some practice in instead. Write a poem. Express your most romantic feelings in a secretive, forbidden-love kind of way.”

Before Ivan could retaliate, Hunter plopped a pen and a sheet of paper into his lap like an offering. “I’ll leave you to it, darling. I’ve got a quest to run. Apparently some of your mirror monster   <<buddies>> are <<throwing a party>> in the town square.”
Ivan puffed out a breath, crossing his arms for dramatic emphasis. 

“Okay, fine, but I’m not letting you read it. It would be embarrassing. You know what all these words actually mean, and I’m just going off vibes. It’s not fair to judge me with your big human brain.”

Hunter laughed brightly, unfiltered, unbearably fond, and leaned down to kiss the top of Ivan’s head. “Sure, sure. Totally won’t peek.”

“That means you will peek,” Ivan grumbled, grabbing his agenda with the over-the-top flourish of a man preparing for battle. He slumped back into the armchair like a sulking prince, already tapping the pen against the page.

Hunter only winked as he headed for the door. “Write something pretty for me. I’ll come back and pretend to be shocked.”

Ivan hissed halfheartedly and buried himself behind the bookcase, the tip of the pen twitching as the door clicked shut behind Hunter.
Hunter returned just as the last bit of sunlight dimmed from the study. 

Ivan was curled into the armchair, knees up, the paper held close to his chest like it contained state secrets.

“You’re back early,” Ivan said, suspicious instantly. “Why? What happened? Did you run? Did you teleport? Did you—”

Hunter raised both hands. “Relax, silver spine. False alarm. Just a bunch of reflective pigeons someone reported as monsters.”

Ivan blinked. “Pigeons?”

“Tiny flying mirrors of disappointment,” Hunter sighed dramatically.

Satisfied, Ivan relaxed. A bit.

Hunter leaned over the back of the armchair. “So. Poem?”

“No.”

“Please?”

“No.”

Hunter pouted. Ivan sighed, squeezed the paper once, then shoved it at Hunter like ripping off a bandage.

“Fine. But only because you’ll whine otherwise.” Hunter took it gently. Ivan covered his face. And then Hunter read. A soft, stunned silence fell over the room.

“…Ivan,” he whispered, voice cracking in the middle, “you wrote a love poem.”

Ivan groaned. “No I didn’t, it’s… artistic metaphor—”
“It literally says, ‘my heart beats too loudly when he enters the room.’”

“It’s about a different he,” Ivan hissed.

Hunter slid into the armchair, pulling Ivan onto his lap with the practiced ease of someone who had definitely done this before. ""You’re adorable,” he murmured against Ivan’s hair.

“Shut up.”

“Make me.”

Ivan couldn’t. Not when Hunter kissed him like the poem was written on his lips.",2,1763305511.0,Smol5161,11,1.0,False

Basically I was in LA for some reason and I spotted Erika Henningsen (Charlie's voice actor) looking very tired and dishevelled. At first I wanted to tell her I was a huge fan of her work and ask for an autograph but when I noticed how exhausted she looked I tried to offer her help.

I asked her if she needed me to call her a cab to go somewhere and if she wanted water or a coffee or something but she seemed disgusted by this. She thought I was hitting on her and started freaking out. I tried to calm her down and explain she's got me all wrong and I was just trying to help but she wouldn't hear it. Suddenly a bunch of the other cast members came to her defence and started telling me to back off, and they all misgendered me thinking I was a creepy guy trying to hit on her or something.

I was devastated, fearful and crying and I tried to explain this was all a big misunderstanding. When they asked why I was acting so sketchy I tried to explain that I was autistic and that's just how I am, and when they kept misgendering me I tried to say I was a trans woman and used she/her pronouns but instead of believing me, they thought I was mocking trans and autistic people. It ended in them all beating me up and me waking up on the verge of tears.

Edit: Why is this getting dislikes? I'm just sharing a dream I had that disturbed me in a sub that I thought might be understanding. ",3,1763305486.0,SafeSpaceofHazbin,5,0.8,False

Then this man appears out of nowhere with calm energy. He asks, “Are you lost and are you okay” in the gentlest voice. I tell him I am looking for a coffee shop I have never been to and he goes, “That is funny I am going there too” which instantly felt comforting.

We walk together and when we get inside we end up sitting and talking. And somehow we start bonding over everything in the world. Books. Space. Science fiction. Islam. Purpose. Life. It becomes the type of conversation that feels like time is pausing just for you.

Then with full confidence he asks, “Can I have your father’s number” Mind you we met ten minutes ago. The drink was still hot. I was still lost in every way possible.

And here is the plot twist. All of this is happening inside my head. My delusions are working overtime again. I have the plan. I have the script. I have the character development. I am just waiting for Allah to deliver the actual platform in real life one day.

**1999**

She kept running. She didn’t know where the darkness would lead her. She only knew she had to escape. From the set, from the crew, from Dory, from Sunny Sandy. Time changed while she ran into the black. She couldn’t tell how, but she knew it didn’t matter anymore.

When her feet started to hurt, she kicked off her heels. The sight of the pink prisons disappearing into the void gave her energy to keep running. When the sweat started to pool on her head, she threw her wig into the abyss and kept running. She was freer than she ever remembered being. Before that moment, she would have worried what her makeup looked like after such exertion. Now, like time, it didn’t matter anymore.

By the time she saw the light, she had broken herself from everything except her dress. The surface she was running on turned to loose dirt before she found herself in a familiar clearing. The smell of the pine trees told her she was home. The little white house waited for her in the center of the circle made by the tree trunks. It was different though.

The breeze didn’t rustle in the grass. The birds didn’t chip, and the cows didn’t low. Her mother didn’t sing inside. Her father’s work boots didn’t tramp around the stables.

Sandra looked behind her to see where she had come from. Only the blackness waited there. She knew she could never go back. Sandy had won her place. She would be good.

Walking up the old wooden stairs, she saw a butterfly perched on the rusted door handle. She decided to wait for it to move. She didn’t have anywhere else to be. She was home, and she would never leave again.

**2024**

Mikey found himself back at his desk as faint rays of light peeked into his office’s cracked window. As he reoriented himself from his deep sleep, he was at peace.

Then it all came back to him. It was the next morning, and he had missed the walk-through with Bree. He looked at the grandfather clock his landlord had left him. 10:30. He had missed his spot with Dotty Doyle. His nerves all firing at once, he jolted upright in his sagging chair. On his desk, he saw the Quality Care contract and the bottle of turned champagne. It was empty. He must have drunk it all. He didn’t remember anything after starting to read the contract.

Pushing himself to stand, he felt a tickle in the cuff of his sleeve. A large, skeletal spider walked out. A soft smile crossed Mikey’s face. Then he saw his phone on the desk. Champagne had dripped onto it. He wiped it off on his pants and braced himself.

He had 33 missed calls and 109 missed texts. Some were from Bree, but the rest were from people he hadn’t talked to in months—years even. His one friend from high school. His law school study group. His parents. Something must have gone horribly wrong. He opened the text from his mother.

“You are going to win this election!” Cartoon balloons flooded the screen. “I’M SO PROUD OF YOU!” Mikey didn’t know how to feel. His mother hadn’t said anything like that since the hospital. After the screaming encouragement, she had sent a link to an article from the town’s online-only newspaper, *The Laurel*. Even in the website’s muted millennial color palette, the headline blared at him.

*MIKEY MAKES GOOD.*

Scrolling past the headline, he saw a picture of a young boy in what were surely his best over-ironed church clothes. The boy was dressed in pastels and sat before a plastic screen printed with an unending grass field and a smiling rainbow overhead. He was posed perfectly, smiling from ear to ear. The smile looked like it hurt. Mikey didn’t recognize the boy, but he knew it was him from a lifetime ago.

“A bombshell detonated in Dove Hill politics today. On veteran journalist Dotty Doyle’s morning show, hometown girl Bree Dobson, currently managing her brother Mikey’s campaign for the state legislature, shared her candidate’s mental health history.”

Mikey’s heart stopped. Then it raged.

“Dobson explained that Mikey’s diagnoses of insomnia and generalized anxiety disorder have kept him from attending several recent campaign events. She apologized for any inconvenience but thanked the good people of Dove Hill for their love and support. In her conversation with Doyle, Dobson said, ‘I’m proud of my brother. Here in the heartland, we don’t talk about mental health enough. He’s man enough to take responsibility for himself and fight on to represent the people of our hometown. This is only a hiccup. Mikey is happy and healthy, and, this Friday night, he is going to show everyone what he’s made of.’”

How could Bree do this? His mind wasn’t anyone’s business but his. Not Bree’s. Not his parents’. Certainly not Dove Hill’s.

“After Bree ended her morning appearance, the campaign shared a statement from the candidate himself. ‘I want to thank all of my friends, family, and supporters for their encouragement during this time. Like everyone else, I get sick. Sometimes it’s a head cold. Sometimes it's just my head. But, no matter what, I always fight through. My struggles have made me stronger and made me want to fight for our beautiful town. I’ve fought for myself and come through better. Now I want to do the same for Dove Hill.’”

The picture under this quote was the man from all the social media ads and flyers that had been going up around his hometown. The man who had his name. The man he didn’t know. In the picture, the man beamed as though he had never seen a cloudy day. Mikey’s blood boiled. He could feel magma erupting through his veins. It felt like his father had described his heart attack.

He fought to steady himself as he returned to the unwanted congratulations. In his email, he found endorsement announcements from everyone from incumbent legislators to the state’s leading mental health advocacy group. Endorsements like these didn’t come quickly. If they were all rolling out on the same day, Bree had been working on this for weeks. It had been her failsafe. At the end of the day, it was *her* campaign.

As he was rereading the words that she had excised through his throat, Bree called again. “What the hell, Bree!” he shouted. He didn’t remember the last time he had shouted. It sounded wrong.

“Well hello to you too,” she snarked back. “Thank you for finally answering my call.”

“What have you done?” His voice thundered with furious betrayal.

“What had to be done. And you’re welcome.”

“Welcome for what?!? That was my story to tell. You have no idea how it feels to live with that.”

“Oh? May I remind you that I’ve been living with it just as long as you have. I lived with it when you couldn’t.”

Mikey paused. She was right. After everything she’d done, he owed this to her.

“I…I’m sorry. You’re right. You’ve been there with me from the beginning. You’ve always fixed things for me.” Still, it was his story to tell. Wasn’t it?

“It’s okay. I’m sorry that it surprised you. I had to do something when you missed the spot with Dotty. I would’ve told you if you had answered.”

“I know.” He wanted to believe her.

“But, hey…” Bree was done with this part of the conversation. “Good news! Everyone loved it. Especially your statement. It’s been shared over 1000 times on socials. It’s even trending in other states. People are inspired. You’re *helping* people. Isn’t that what you’ve always wanted?”

It was. He just never thought it would be like this. That it would feel like he was the medicine instead of the doctor. Like he was a tool in someone else’s hands.

“It is. I…I’m happy with how it turned out.”

“Me too,” she said. “People love healing narratives. The authentic. They just want it be pretty. That’s where I come in.”

She was right. This was Mikey’s story, but Bree told it better. That’s what people wanted. And he wanted to be whatever people wanted.

“Again, I’m sorry for blowing up at you. And for not answering your calls. Or your texts.” The world was still confusing, but he could never forget how to apologize.

“It’s okay, Mikey. I’m proud of you. Mom and Dad even called to say they saw the article in *The Laurel*. Mom sounded…as happy as she ever does.” In the short silence that followed, they were siblings again. Just a brother and a sister mourning the warmth they had never known. “Now are you okay? We can’t have you missing any more events. Especially not the debate.”

“I’m fine. I just fell asleep at my desk. Hard I guess. You know how tough this campaign is better than anyone.”

“Well, that’s okay. Just rest up for tonight. You’re going to be good.”

“You’re going to be good.” As he drove down Main Street, he turned the words over and around in his head. It was the campaign promise of his life. He was going to be good. Even if it hurt. Even if it scarred. Even if it left him not recognizing himself. *He was going to be good*. He didn’t have a choice.

On the way to his apartment, he stopped at the liquor store. When he made it home, he paced his bedroom while he should have been practicing his talking points. In a way, he was practicing them.

Point one: he was thankful that he could count on Bree to fix things for him. Point two: he was eager to serve Dove Hill—whatever it cost. Point three: He was exactly where he was supposed to be. Closing: that night, he was going to be good. Every time his mind wound its way back to that existential truth, he took a drink. By the time he was tying his best ragged black shoes, the bottle was empty.

He knew that driving after emptying a bottle wasn’t safe, but he had made up his mind. He had to show everyone how strong he was. He hadn’t been weak again.

Bree welcomed him when he arrived at the auditorium. “Good news!” she cheered, pulling him in for a  hug. “You’re leading in the polls for the first time. If you do well tonight, you can win this race.” Just days ago, he thought he still had a chance, maybe a choice.

“I’m going to be good. I promise.” He wasn’t going to let her down this time. For a second, his sister looked at him like she didn’t fully recognize him. Like something had changed. He was more certain than she had ever seen him.

“Alright, then. I’m glad to see you sharp and ready to go!” She couldn’t tell it was certitude in surrender.

Trying to convince himself he wanted this, he took his place on the stage. His opponent, Senator Pruce, had the easy bearing of someone who hadn’t faced a challenge anytime in his career—or his life. Looking out into the audience, Mikey noticed it was only a third full. Still, it felt like the whole world was watching him. Like a billion eyes were burning his skin.

At 7:00 pm sharp, Dotty Doyle began talking to the camera, her oldest friend. “Good evening, Dove Hill. I’m Dotty Doyle.”

“And I’m Joni Jarrett,” Joni Jarrett chimed in. Dotty Doyle could barely hide her disdain for her younger colleague.

Dotty continued. “And welcome to debate night in Mason County. Tonight, our town’s two candidates for Dove Hill’s seat in the state senate are squaring off. In one corner, we have 12-time incumbent Edmund Pruce.” Senator Pruce waved as the high school student operating the spotlight turned it onto him. He glowed as though the entire town was his birthright. Behind him, his official portrait frowned on the projector screen.

“Good evening, Senator!” Joni chirped to Dotty’s annoyance. Senator Pruce eyed her luridly.

“And in this corner, riding a wave following a courageous personal revelation, we have Dove Hill’s own Mikey Dobson!” Even a consummate professional like Dotty couldn’t hide her preference for Mikey. Joni clapped like Sunny Sandy in Dr. Percy’s clinic.

He looked behind him. The screen broadcasted a large picture of the man he had come to accept was him. He recognized the desperate, toothy smile. As he looked on, resigning to his fate, the smile on the screen grew wider and wider. Its skin started to tear. Blood pooled at the corners. Mikey came back to himself.

He didn’t want to be here. He didn’t want to be *him*. Somewhere above him, music started. The ghostly piano. *If you’re not feeling happy today, just put on a smiling face…* The spotlight turned its blinding beam onto him. All he could see was white.

\*	\*	\*

The only thing that told Mikey he had left the auditorium was the smell. Instead of the scent of sweat soaked into old chairs, he was surrounded by the saccharine smell of artificial vanilla. He knew he was back in Sandy’s house before he opened his eyes. When he did, he saw a large white wooden rectangle the size of a conference room table. Looking down, he saw that he was sitting in a matching chair that was too big for his body. He felt like a child someone had sat down for a snack.

His animal friends sat around him: Maggie, Rupert, Silvia, Percy. Tommy sat right beside him. If Mikey was too small for his chair, his friends were dwarfed by theirs. Further down the table, Mikey saw an orange owl and a green horse he didn’t recognize. Mikey felt more at home with these friends than he had in the high school. At least they knew he needed help. He didn’t have to hide from them. He couldn’t even if he wanted to. They knew he was imperfect, and they accepted him anyway.

He noticed they were all looking patiently at the head of the table. He followed their eyes and remembered why he had been afraid of coming back here. At the other end of the table, Sandy was sitting proudly with perfect posture. Her chair was painted pink and fit her like a throne. Her eyes wandered around the table. A judge examining livestock at a county fair—scouring each of Mikey’s friends for any imperfect feeling, any emotion that didn’t belong in her pastel playland. She turned her face to him. He fought the fear that flooded over him at the sight of her manic eyes and slicing smile. Around her table, joy was a demand. He did his best to obey.

Apparently he did well enough because Sandy kindly moved along. She then raised a large crystal glass of milk and struck it ceremoniously with her knifepoint pink nails. The ruffles of her dress shook with the motion. After a polite cough, she proclaimed, “Alrighty, friends! We’ve had a lot of fun today. Now it’s snack time! We all know what to do.” She gave Mikey a knowing look. “Let’s all call Maple and Mabel together.”

Mikey and his friends joined her. “Oh, Maple and Mabel!” Two plump chickens walked into the room then. They both looked painted: one the color of corn syrup and one the color of coal. Other than their colors, they looked like ordinary chickens who should have been flapping their wings and clucking to each other. Instead, they were as silent and as lifelike as marionettes. They walked around the table and gave each animal a large tan cookie. In turn, the animals said, “Thank you, Mable!” to the black chicken or “Thank you, Maple!” to the brown one. Sandy’s work had been fruitful. He couldn’t tell if his friends were genuinely grateful for their cookies or not.

After Maple gave Sandy her cookie, the chickens walked noiselessly back into what Mikey hoped was the kitchen. “Okie dokie!” Sandy cheered. “Everybody eat up!” The animals bit into their cookies in unison. Their expressions were blank. Sandy savored her snack. Mikey followed a moment behind and sunk his teeth into his, expecting the flavor to match the overwhelming aroma of peanut butter.

It felt like coarse sand in his mouth. He almost choked on it. When he picked up his napkin to spit it out, Tommy poked his flipper into Mikey’s side. His eyes were a warning. Realizing his mistake, Mikey darted his eyes towards Sandy. She was lost in the flavor of her cookie, somehow enjoying it in a way that nothing purely human could. Mikey braced himself and swallowed the bark-flavored paste that had coagulated on his tongue. He leaned down to whisper where Tommy’s ear should have been.

“What *is* this? How are you eating it?”

Tommy looked at Mikey like he was a child asking why they needed to shelter from a tornado. “It’s sawdust. Sandy only allows food that won’t make you grow. She wants us all to be small forever so she can take care of us. Eventually, you get used to it. It’s all you have.”

Mikey’s fear broke into sadness. Sadness for his friends who were left with no other choices. Even sadness for Sandy who thought she was helping. He was still afraid of her, but it was a fear mixed with heartbroken compassion. She was doing what she was made to do.

He looked across the table to the glinting glass window that overlooked Sandy’s garden. He had seen it from Rupert’s bookstore, but he could truly see it now. The statues had looked like animals from a distance—like memorials to Mikey’s friends. Looking more closely, he could see that they were humans: people of all kinds, from every gender, age, race. Anyone could see themselves in Sandy’s garden. They had looked like animals from across the street because their postures were not natural. They were contorted into shapes of uncanny joy, shapes that humans were not supposed to make. One statue faced the window like he was eagerly waiting for his snack. His eyes were wet.

Sandy chirped again just as Mikey began to see something moving in the statue’s eyes. “Friends, we’ve had another sunny day in Sunnyside Square, haven’t we?”

Mikey and his friends all nodded enthusiastically and muttered their gratitude. They knew their lines.

“Now it’s time to share our sunniness with each other. Just like we do every day, we’re going to go around the table and everyone’s going to share something they’re thankful for.” Something he was thankful for? Like being silenced? Like his broken arm? Like sawdust? “And, remember,” Sandy continued. “No repeating. Everyone has their own sunshine to share.” Mikey’s heart beat between anger and panic. What was he going to say? What *could* he say?

Sitting next to Sandy, the orange owl whose name was Orville said that he was thankful for Sandy. Sandy liked that and gave Orville a kiss on the cheek. Orville squeezed his eyes shut as she bent towards him. The green horse was next. Her name was Gertie, and she was thankful for the cookies. Every one of Mikey’s friends made their offering. They had had practice. By the time it was Mikey’s turn, he sat in silent terror. He had to be grateful, or Sandy would help him.

Then he realized that he did have something to be thankful for. Something that none of his friends could have ever known. “I’m thankful for my friends,” he said with plain honesty. “I’m so thankful that you all taught me how to be sunny in Sunnyside Square.” He may not have wanted to be sunny, but it was better than what would happen if he wasn’t. He really was grateful. He was feeling just as Sandy demanded.

“Oh!” Sandy giggled happily. “That’s so sweet! That’s what Sunnyside Square is all about. Learning how to be sunny.” Sandy almost moved along to Rupert before something in her shifted. “But, Mikey…what do you mean that our friends *taught* you to be sunny? Being sunny happens inside of you.”

The animals looked at Mikey with petrified eyes. Their felt bodies twitched with fear. They wanted to say something, even to make a gesture. They couldn’t. Sandy was watching them all. Mikey didn’t understand. For once, he knew he was doing exactly what was expected of him.

“Y-yeah,” he stuttered. “Everyone here helped me today. Maggie, Rupert, Tommy, they all showed me how to play in Sunnyside Square. They’re my friends.” They looked at him like he had stabbed them all in their backs with one fell swoop. They didn’t even try to hide their terror any longer. It was too late.

“But…” Sandy stammered, her voice unsure for the first time. “If…if…if,” she was like a malfunctioning computer. Then her voice fell with the gravity of a crashing star. “Everyone in the Square is supposed to learn the rules themselves. That’s the reason I cr—the reason the Square exists. To help people learn to be *sunny*.” She rose from her pink throne. Her petite frame and pillar of blonde hair loomed over them. She was mutating. Mikey looked at her wide-eyed. His friends looked like they were saying their last rites. “If *they*,” she said with derision, “helped you, that would be cheating. And cheating is lying.” With every pinched sentence, the volume and pitch of her voice rose until they composed a howling siren. “And friends don’t lie to each other. And if you’re not my friends…” She turned to the animals with a quiet sentence. “Then you can’t be here.”

Mikey looked for reassurance from his friends around the table. They were as frightened as he was. No one knew what Sandy would do. Her smile had shattered.

She stomped her foot. An otherworldly whoosh thundered through the room, and one by one, Mikey’s friends…changed. A moment before they had been alive. Animals, yes. Frightened, yes. But alive. Now, they were…empty. They each lay flatly in their chairs like scavenged carcasses. They had been his friends. Under Sandy’s fury, they had become nothing more than puppets. Lifeless piles of felt. Mikey looked down at Tommy. He could see the hole where a puppeteer’s hand should have been.

Mikey stood up and tried to shout. “What have you done?!? Put them back! Put them back now!” He couldn’t open his mouth. Sandy didn’t want to hear angry words. He could only smile from ear to ear while he saw red.

“I’m sorry, Mikey,” Sandy said. It made him angrier that she meant it. She had turned back into the figure he had met on his first day in the Square. Deathly sweet. “They weren’t good for you. They had to go.”

Mikey began to cry through his smile. He had done the right thing. He had done exactly what Sandy wanted. And he had still lost his friends. He had killed his friends. He had been strong and still broken.

“It’s okay, though,” Sandy said as she walked across the dining room towards him. “You tried so hard to be sunny, and that makes you very special. Since I built the Square, I’ve had lots and lots of friends who did their best to be sunny. It’s just so hard when you have all those ugly feelings inside.” He didn’t know what to say. Or think. Or feel. She was comforting him like a mother, but there was a fatal certainty in her words. “So, when one of my friends has a day like yours, I help them become something better.” She hugged him. He stood like a stone, but her limbs were as heavy as lead. When she released him, she gestured towards the garden. “After a few more days, you’ll get to join them!” He knew why the statues looked so alive. “I’m so happy for you!” she cheered and clapped her hands together in pride.

His instincts took control. He pushed past Sandy whose small cloud of a skirt poofed when she hit the floor. He ran out of the dining room, through the entranceway, and out of Sandy’s house. He sped through the park and onto the sidewalks of the Square. He didn’t know where he was going. He just had to get away from her. He couldn’t let her help him.

“Mr. Dobson…” Dotty Doyle prompted. “Mr. Dob…Mikey…” The show had to go on. Mikey didn’t respond. He was in the Square. If he had known the audience was staring at him, he would have thought they were judging him, rejecting him. He would not have been able to see the fear and concern in their faces. Senator Pruce stood awkwardly and waited for someone to tell him what to do. He had made a career out of that after all. Mikey smiled into the spotlight.

When she could tell that something had gone wrong, Bree rushed onto the stage. The audience could tell that she was no longer playing the part of campaign manager. Now, she was only a big sister scared for her brother. Before Bree could get to him, Mikey collapsed behind the podium almost striking his chin on the way down. Even Senator Pruce gasped and reached to help him. With all her might, Bree lifted her brother into her arms. She looked like a girl under his lanky frame. As Bree carried him off, Mikey vomited through his tight lips.

“May I help you, Ms. Dobson?” Senator Pruce asked, eager to prove himself a responsive and caring leader.

“No comment.”

“Is Mikey alright?” Dotty Doyle echoed. She didn’t want to seem cold. The whole town had been watching Mikey. Now it feared for him.

“No comment.”

As Bree carried her brother down the stage stairs, Joni Jarrett came to her. She had left her microphone at Dotty’s table. “Bree, how can I help? Should I call an ambulance? Are you…”

“No comment!” Bree snapped.

Joni frowned. She hadn’t been performing. “I’m sorry. I…”

\*	\*	\*

“It’s okay, Mikey!” Sandy’s voice clapped like thunder through the air. Mikey was panting as he ran past the clinic, but he could still hear Sandy as though she were right behind him. “You were so close today. We’ll just try again tomorrow!”

Mikey had decided there would not be a tomorrow. He was going to leave now. Sandy’s giggle echoed so loudly that the earth shook under him. Bricks in the sidewalk began to come loose. Above him, the paper mache sun began moving backwards. Back to where it was when he had first been brought to the Square.

As he turned the corner by Rupert’s bookstore, he heard the theme song. The piano started to play. Sandy started to sing. *“If you’re not feeling happy today, just put on a smiling face…*” Running past doors to nowhere, Mikey knew that he would never leave the Square if the show started again. At the end of the sidewalk, he saw a dark shadow. He didn’t know what it was, but it wasn’t the Square. He bolted towards it.

*“It’ll make the pain go away before you forget to say*…” Just as Sandy finished her last phrase and the sun that didn’t shine assumed its position, Mikey threw himself into the shadow.

He found himself in an impossibly dark alley. Overhead, he could see faint beams of focused, yellow light. He walked through the dust that tried to enter his lungs. Then he remembered what Rupert had said. This was Out.

Mikey's knees buckled under him as he recalled what Rupert had said. He didn’t want to be Out, but he couldn’t be in the Square anymore. He reached his arms out to see if there were any other ways to safety. His fingers brushed against dusty brick. The only way was forward. He walked on.

Just as Rupert had said, he started to forget himself. He forgot about the campaign. He even forgot about Dove Hill. But he knew he had to walk on.

He reminded himself to place one foot in front of the other. He had to keep walking on even if he was forgetting how. By the time he forgot what time was, he found himself feeling empty. Happy but empty. He walked on. Something inside of him told him there was something better. Something more real waiting for him.

Just as he was about to forget his name, Mikey saw light coming from the end of the alley. It was a faint light barely breaking through the dark, but it was there. It was real.

When he stepped out of the alley, he found himself in a clearing surrounded by a rough ring of pine trees. The sun shone through clouds overhead. Its light fell softly but warmed his body.

He looked behind him to see what he had survived. From the other side, Out was just a brick-lined walkway, a path through the dark. It almost felt welcoming, but Mikey knew he didn’t belong there. Not anymore.

He turned back to look at the clearing surrounding him. It was full of wildflowers and unkempt flower beds with early signs of life. In the middle of the garden stood a small, plain house. It was made of the same white wood so popular in Sandy’s Square, but its wood was roughly weathered and unevenly painted. It had been lived in. It had survived. A large flutter of butterflies flew around the house in all directions. They weren’t trying to be beautiful. They simply were.

Mikey felt at home in the garden. He had thought he felt at home in Dove Hill and then, for a moment, in the Square. But this was different. In those places, home was being loved for being exactly what everyone told you to be. It was belonging through obedience. Here, wherever it was, home was being free. Free to do nothing more than breathe. And to be loved anyway.

He felt the screened door to the simple house calling to him. He walked up the stairs kept together with rusty nails. He knocked three times on the door.

One. Two. Three.

Nothing happened. Mikey sighed. He had been foolish to expect anything more. No one could live in a place this peaceful.

Then he heard a voice from inside. “One second, hon!” It was the voice of an old, tired woman, but it sounded bright. When the woman opened the door, Mikey knew her instantly. He didn’t yet know her name, but he knew she was a woman who had lived a hard life and yet, somehow, held on to joy. Her long blonde hair was tied in a messy ponytail, and she wore a thin white button-down shirt and torn blue jeans. She wasn’t glamorous. She wasn’t even especially pretty. And her nails and her home were unmanicured. But she was happy.

“Hey there, baby!” she said warmly. She was a person who had never met a stranger. “How do you do?” she reached out her wrinkled hand to shake Mikey’s. “I’m Sandra Alan.”

Mikey put his hand in hers and shook unsteadily. He thought he had escaped the Square. He had just entered a new one. Sandra could feel the fear in his pulse. “It’s okay, sweetie.” Sandra patted his hand gently. “If you don’t want to shake, you don’t have to. Hell, you can turn around and leave if you want.” She smiled at him playfully. She meant those words.

Before he knew what he was doing, Mikey threw himself onto Sandra and hugged her. She had felt his fear but not judged him. She had given him a choice. Sandra put her small arms around him. Mikey was much taller than her four-foot frame.

“Now, now, it’s alright.” Sandra took a step back and placed her hands on Mikey’s shoulders. “You’re not there anymore. You’re safe.” Mikey stared at her and wiped the tears that had begun to form in his eyes. “I’m sure you have a lot of questions. You wait on the porch and I’ll bring us some coffee.”

Nodding tiredly, Mikey stepped back onto Sandra’s porch and found two weather-eaten rocking chairs. He sat on one and listened to the faint sound of Sandra pouring their coffee. A few minutes later, Sandra walked through the screen door holding a silver coffee service with chipped mugs and a spotted coffee pot. She poured Mikey his cup and sat down in the other rocking chair. She patted his leg with calm firmness.

“Alright,” she said. “Whatcha got?”

Mikey had so many questions. He thought he ought to understand who this was first. “Are you *her*…?”

“Starting with the hard one, huh?” Sandra laughed kindly. “Well, yes. And no.” Mikey held his breath for her next words. “My name is Sandra Alan. The local papers called me Sunny Sandy during my pageant days. That was a *long* time ago.” Mikey thought she was trying to be self-deprecating. He gave her a polite laugh. “It’s okay, Mikey. I know I’m not that funny.” That made him laugh from his belly. “They called me that because I was always grinning, even when my heels were hurting or the spotlight was in my eyes. My parents were old-fashioned, so they made sure I knew how a good kid was supposed to smile.”

Mikey started to relax. Even if this woman was some strange relative of the Sandy he had just escaped, she knew what his life had been like. It had been her life too.

Sandra continued telling her story. “Well, before you knew it, a talent scout from the big city saw me at one of my pageants. He was real impressed by my talent: my puppet friend Maggie.” Mikey’s heart hurt as he started to tell Sandra what had happened to her friend. “It’s okay, Mikey,” she said like she had been expecting it. “Sandy and I have been through this day more than a few times by now.”

“So…” Mikey said after listening so far into Sandra’s story. “If *you’re* Sandra Alan, the TV host, what’s…*she*?”

Sandra sighed sadly. “That’s what’s hard to explain, Mikey. She’s…me. Or, part of me.” She could see the confusion in Mikey’s eyes. “I know that doesn’t make very much sense, but it’s the best I can say. I gave every piece of myself to make *Sunnyside Square*. I didn’t even stay with my Papa after my Mama’s funeral so I could get back to the city for the finale shoot. Me and Papa didn’t talk much after that. Looking back, every time I told myself I wasn’t sad or angry or hurt, I sacrificed more of my life to the show. To the Square.”

“I know the feeling.” Mikey had been doing the same with the campaign.

“One day, I couldn’t do it anymore. My heart just couldn’t take it. I ran away and wound up here. The next day, I tried to go back, but the studio was gone. There was only the Square. When I saw Sandy, I knew what she was. She was what I had become making the show. She was the part of me that wouldn’t let myself be anything but sunny. She told me she could help me be like her. I ended up running back here.”

Mikey could see the resignation in Sandra’s eyes. A sadness that said she deserved that day. “Well, you can come back now, can’t you?” he said hopefully. “I know Dove Hill would love to see you again. No one’s heard from you in decades.”

“That’s very kind, Mikey,” Sandra said as she gently blew a butterfly off the rim of her coffee cup. “But I can’t. After the Square brought me here…” She couldn’t continue. Mikey didn’t need her to. He knew Sandy had stolen her world.

“Well, can I stay with you?” He thought she needed a friend, but he also didn’t want to face what he had to go back to.

“You can…” Sandra explained. “But I don’t think you really want to. You still have a life to live. Your firm, your parents, Bree.”

“I don’t know. I think all they love is who they want me to be.”

“That’s because that’s the only person you’ve let them know. You’ve never been yourself with them. Or with anyone. And I’m afraid that’s partially my fault. You should be allowed to feel however you feel. Sunny or not.” Sandra set down her coffee cup and took Mikey’s hands in hers. “I’m sorry she—I didn’t teach you that.”

“You did the best you knew how.”

“I did, but now you can do something different. Live your life honestly. Let the people you love know how you feel even if it’s hard. Be wild and messy and real. That’s the only way to really be good. For yourself or anyone else.”

Her words crashed into him like water breaking over a dam. She was right. He had never trusted himself to let anyone know him. He wondered if he could do anything more.

“Mikey, I’m never leaving here.” Her hands held his like she was pleading for him to save his own life. “You still can.”",1,1763305108.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

**1999**

She kept running. She didn’t know where the darkness would lead her. She only knew she had to escape. From the set, from the crew, from Dory, from Sunny Sandy. Time changed while she ran into the black. She couldn’t tell how, but she knew it didn’t matter anymore.

When her feet started to hurt, she kicked off her heels. The sight of the pink prisons disappearing into the void gave her energy to keep running. When the sweat started to pool on her head, she threw her wig into the abyss and kept running. She was freer than she ever remembered being. Before that moment, she would have worried what her makeup looked like after such exertion. Now, like time, it didn’t matter anymore.

By the time she saw the light, she had broken herself from everything except her dress. The surface she was running on turned to loose dirt before she found herself in a familiar clearing. The smell of the pine trees told her she was home. The little white house waited for her in the center of the circle made by the tree trunks. It was different though.

The breeze didn’t rustle in the grass. The birds didn’t chip, and the cows didn’t low. Her mother didn’t sing inside. Her father’s work boots didn’t tramp around the stables.

Sandra looked behind her to see where she had come from. Only the blackness waited there. She knew she could never go back. Sandy had won her place. She would be good.

Walking up the old wooden stairs, she saw a butterfly perched on the rusted door handle. She decided to wait for it to move. She didn’t have anywhere else to be. She was home, and she would never leave again.

**2024**

Mikey found himself back at his desk as faint rays of light peeked into his office’s cracked window. As he reoriented himself from his deep sleep, he was at peace.

Then it all came back to him. It was the next morning, and he had missed the walk-through with Bree. He looked at the grandfather clock his landlord had left him. 10:30. He had missed his spot with Dotty Doyle. His nerves all firing at once, he jolted upright in his sagging chair. On his desk, he saw the Quality Care contract and the bottle of turned champagne. It was empty. He must have drunk it all. He didn’t remember anything after starting to read the contract.

Pushing himself to stand, he felt a tickle in the cuff of his sleeve. A large, skeletal spider walked out. A soft smile crossed Mikey’s face. Then he saw his phone on the desk. Champagne had dripped onto it. He wiped it off on his pants and braced himself.

He had 33 missed calls and 109 missed texts. Some were from Bree, but the rest were from people he hadn’t talked to in months—years even. His one friend from high school. His law school study group. His parents. Something must have gone horribly wrong. He opened the text from his mother.

“You are going to win this election!” Cartoon balloons flooded the screen. “I’M SO PROUD OF YOU!” Mikey didn’t know how to feel. His mother hadn’t said anything like that since the hospital. After the screaming encouragement, she had sent a link to an article from the town’s online-only newspaper, *The Laurel*. Even in the website’s muted millennial color palette, the headline blared at him.

*MIKEY MAKES GOOD.*

Scrolling past the headline, he saw a picture of a young boy in what were surely his best over-ironed church clothes. The boy was dressed in pastels and sat before a plastic screen printed with an unending grass field and a smiling rainbow overhead. He was posed perfectly, smiling from ear to ear. The smile looked like it hurt. Mikey didn’t recognize the boy, but he knew it was him from a lifetime ago.

“A bombshell detonated in Dove Hill politics today. On veteran journalist Dotty Doyle’s morning show, hometown girl Bree Dobson, currently managing her brother Mikey’s campaign for the state legislature, shared her candidate’s mental health history.”

Mikey’s heart stopped. Then it raged.

“Dobson explained that Mikey’s diagnoses of insomnia and generalized anxiety disorder have kept him from attending several recent campaign events. She apologized for any inconvenience but thanked the good people of Dove Hill for their love and support. In her conversation with Doyle, Dobson said, ‘I’m proud of my brother. Here in the heartland, we don’t talk about mental health enough. He’s man enough to take responsibility for himself and fight on to represent the people of our hometown. This is only a hiccup. Mikey is happy and healthy, and, this Friday night, he is going to show everyone what he’s made of.’”

How could Bree do this? His mind wasn’t anyone’s business but his. Not Bree’s. Not his parents’. Certainly not Dove Hill’s.

“After Bree ended her morning appearance, the campaign shared a statement from the candidate himself. ‘I want to thank all of my friends, family, and supporters for their encouragement during this time. Like everyone else, I get sick. Sometimes it’s a head cold. Sometimes it's just my head. But, no matter what, I always fight through. My struggles have made me stronger and made me want to fight for our beautiful town. I’ve fought for myself and come through better. Now I want to do the same for Dove Hill.’”

The picture under this quote was the man from all the social media ads and flyers that had been going up around his hometown. The man who had his name. The man he didn’t know. In the picture, the man beamed as though he had never seen a cloudy day. Mikey’s blood boiled. He could feel magma erupting through his veins. It felt like his father had described his heart attack.

He fought to steady himself as he returned to the unwanted congratulations. In his email, he found endorsement announcements from everyone from incumbent legislators to the state’s leading mental health advocacy group. Endorsements like these didn’t come quickly. If they were all rolling out on the same day, Bree had been working on this for weeks. It had been her failsafe. At the end of the day, it was *her* campaign.

As he was rereading the words that she had excised through his throat, Bree called again. “What the hell, Bree!” he shouted. He didn’t remember the last time he had shouted. It sounded wrong.

“Well hello to you too,” she snarked back. “Thank you for finally answering my call.”

“What have you done?” His voice thundered with furious betrayal.

“What had to be done. And you’re welcome.”

“Welcome for what?!? That was my story to tell. You have no idea how it feels to live with that.”

“Oh? May I remind you that I’ve been living with it just as long as you have. I lived with it when you couldn’t.”

Mikey paused. She was right. After everything she’d done, he owed this to her.

“I…I’m sorry. You’re right. You’ve been there with me from the beginning. You’ve always fixed things for me.” Still, it was his story to tell. Wasn’t it?

“It’s okay. I’m sorry that it surprised you. I had to do something when you missed the spot with Dotty. I would’ve told you if you had answered.”

“I know.” He wanted to believe her.

“But, hey…” Bree was done with this part of the conversation. “Good news! Everyone loved it. Especially your statement. It’s been shared over 1000 times on socials. It’s even trending in other states. People are inspired. You’re *helping* people. Isn’t that what you’ve always wanted?”

It was. He just never thought it would be like this. That it would feel like he was the medicine instead of the doctor. Like he was a tool in someone else’s hands.

“It is. I…I’m happy with how it turned out.”

“Me too,” she said. “People love healing narratives. The authentic. They just want it be pretty. That’s where I come in.”

She was right. This was Mikey’s story, but Bree told it better. That’s what people wanted. And he wanted to be whatever people wanted.

“Again, I’m sorry for blowing up at you. And for not answering your calls. Or your texts.” The world was still confusing, but he could never forget how to apologize.

“It’s okay, Mikey. I’m proud of you. Mom and Dad even called to say they saw the article in *The Laurel*. Mom sounded…as happy as she ever does.” In the short silence that followed, they were siblings again. Just a brother and a sister mourning the warmth they had never known. “Now are you okay? We can’t have you missing any more events. Especially not the debate.”

“I’m fine. I just fell asleep at my desk. Hard I guess. You know how tough this campaign is better than anyone.”

“Well, that’s okay. Just rest up for tonight. You’re going to be good.”

“You’re going to be good.” As he drove down Main Street, he turned the words over and around in his head. It was the campaign promise of his life. He was going to be good. Even if it hurt. Even if it scarred. Even if it left him not recognizing himself. *He was going to be good*. He didn’t have a choice.

On the way to his apartment, he stopped at the liquor store. When he made it home, he paced his bedroom while he should have been practicing his talking points. In a way, he was practicing them.

Point one: he was thankful that he could count on Bree to fix things for him. Point two: he was eager to serve Dove Hill—whatever it cost. Point three: He was exactly where he was supposed to be. Closing: that night, he was going to be good. Every time his mind wound its way back to that existential truth, he took a drink. By the time he was tying his best ragged black shoes, the bottle was empty.

He knew that driving after emptying a bottle wasn’t safe, but he had made up his mind. He had to show everyone how strong he was. He hadn’t been weak again.

Bree welcomed him when he arrived at the auditorium. “Good news!” she cheered, pulling him in for a  hug. “You’re leading in the polls for the first time. If you do well tonight, you can win this race.” Just days ago, he thought he still had a chance, maybe a choice.

“I’m going to be good. I promise.” He wasn’t going to let her down this time. For a second, his sister looked at him like she didn’t fully recognize him. Like something had changed. He was more certain than she had ever seen him.

“Alright, then. I’m glad to see you sharp and ready to go!” She couldn’t tell it was certitude in surrender.

Trying to convince himself he wanted this, he took his place on the stage. His opponent, Senator Pruce, had the easy bearing of someone who hadn’t faced a challenge anytime in his career—or his life. Looking out into the audience, Mikey noticed it was only a third full. Still, it felt like the whole world was watching him. Like a billion eyes were burning his skin.

At 7:00 pm sharp, Dotty Doyle began talking to the camera, her oldest friend. “Good evening, Dove Hill. I’m Dotty Doyle.”

“And I’m Joni Jarrett,” Joni Jarrett chimed in. Dotty Doyle could barely hide her disdain for her younger colleague.

Dotty continued. “And welcome to debate night in Mason County. Tonight, our town’s two candidates for Dove Hill’s seat in the state senate are squaring off. In one corner, we have 12-time incumbent Edmund Pruce.” Senator Pruce waved as the high school student operating the spotlight turned it onto him. He glowed as though the entire town was his birthright. Behind him, his official portrait frowned on the projector screen.

“Good evening, Senator!” Joni chirped to Dotty’s annoyance. Senator Pruce eyed her luridly.

“And in this corner, riding a wave following a courageous personal revelation, we have Dove Hill’s own Mikey Dobson!” Even a consummate professional like Dotty couldn’t hide her preference for Mikey. Joni clapped like Sunny Sandy in Dr. Percy’s clinic.

He looked behind him. The screen broadcasted a large picture of the man he had come to accept was him. He recognized the desperate, toothy smile. As he looked on, resigning to his fate, the smile on the screen grew wider and wider. Its skin started to tear. Blood pooled at the corners. Mikey came back to himself.

He didn’t want to be here. He didn’t want to be *him*. Somewhere above him, music started. The ghostly piano. *If you’re not feeling happy today, just put on a smiling face…* The spotlight turned its blinding beam onto him. All he could see was white.

\*	\*	\*

The only thing that told Mikey he had left the auditorium was the smell. Instead of the scent of sweat soaked into old chairs, he was surrounded by the saccharine smell of artificial vanilla. He knew he was back in Sandy’s house before he opened his eyes. When he did, he saw a large white wooden rectangle the size of a conference room table. Looking down, he saw that he was sitting in a matching chair that was too big for his body. He felt like a child someone had sat down for a snack.

His animal friends sat around him: Maggie, Rupert, Silvia, Percy. Tommy sat right beside him. If Mikey was too small for his chair, his friends were dwarfed by theirs. Further down the table, Mikey saw an orange owl and a green horse he didn’t recognize. Mikey felt more at home with these friends than he had in the high school. At least they knew he needed help. He didn’t have to hide from them. He couldn’t even if he wanted to. They knew he was imperfect, and they accepted him anyway.

He noticed they were all looking patiently at the head of the table. He followed their eyes and remembered why he had been afraid of coming back here. At the other end of the table, Sandy was sitting proudly with perfect posture. Her chair was painted pink and fit her like a throne. Her eyes wandered around the table. A judge examining livestock at a county fair—scouring each of Mikey’s friends for any imperfect feeling, any emotion that didn’t belong in her pastel playland. She turned her face to him. He fought the fear that flooded over him at the sight of her manic eyes and slicing smile. Around her table, joy was a demand. He did his best to obey.

Apparently he did well enough because Sandy kindly moved along. She then raised a large crystal glass of milk and struck it ceremoniously with her knifepoint pink nails. The ruffles of her dress shook with the motion. After a polite cough, she proclaimed, “Alrighty, friends! We’ve had a lot of fun today. Now it’s snack time! We all know what to do.” She gave Mikey a knowing look. “Let’s all call Maple and Mabel together.”

Mikey and his friends joined her. “Oh, Maple and Mabel!” Two plump chickens walked into the room then. They both looked painted: one the color of corn syrup and one the color of coal. Other than their colors, they looked like ordinary chickens who should have been flapping their wings and clucking to each other. Instead, they were as silent and as lifelike as marionettes. They walked around the table and gave each animal a large tan cookie. In turn, the animals said, “Thank you, Mable!” to the black chicken or “Thank you, Maple!” to the brown one. Sandy’s work had been fruitful. He couldn’t tell if his friends were genuinely grateful for their cookies or not.

After Maple gave Sandy her cookie, the chickens walked noiselessly back into what Mikey hoped was the kitchen. “Okie dokie!” Sandy cheered. “Everybody eat up!” The animals bit into their cookies in unison. Their expressions were blank. Sandy savored her snack. Mikey followed a moment behind and sunk his teeth into his, expecting the flavor to match the overwhelming aroma of peanut butter.

It felt like coarse sand in his mouth. He almost choked on it. When he picked up his napkin to spit it out, Tommy poked his flipper into Mikey’s side. His eyes were a warning. Realizing his mistake, Mikey darted his eyes towards Sandy. She was lost in the flavor of her cookie, somehow enjoying it in a way that nothing purely human could. Mikey braced himself and swallowed the bark-flavored paste that had coagulated on his tongue. He leaned down to whisper where Tommy’s ear should have been.

“What *is* this? How are you eating it?”

Tommy looked at Mikey like he was a child asking why they needed to shelter from a tornado. “It’s sawdust. Sandy only allows food that won’t make you grow. She wants us all to be small forever so she can take care of us. Eventually, you get used to it. It’s all you have.”

Mikey’s fear broke into sadness. Sadness for his friends who were left with no other choices. Even sadness for Sandy who thought she was helping. He was still afraid of her, but it was a fear mixed with heartbroken compassion. She was doing what she was made to do.

He looked across the table to the glinting glass window that overlooked Sandy’s garden. He had seen it from Rupert’s bookstore, but he could truly see it now. The statues had looked like animals from a distance—like memorials to Mikey’s friends. Looking more closely, he could see that they were humans: people of all kinds, from every gender, age, race. Anyone could see themselves in Sandy’s garden. They had looked like animals from across the street because their postures were not natural. They were contorted into shapes of uncanny joy, shapes that humans were not supposed to make. One statue faced the window like he was eagerly waiting for his snack. His eyes were wet.

Sandy chirped again just as Mikey began to see something moving in the statue’s eyes. “Friends, we’ve had another sunny day in Sunnyside Square, haven’t we?”

Mikey and his friends all nodded enthusiastically and muttered their gratitude. They knew their lines.

“Now it’s time to share our sunniness with each other. Just like we do every day, we’re going to go around the table and everyone’s going to share something they’re thankful for.” Something he was thankful for? Like being silenced? Like his broken arm? Like sawdust? “And, remember,” Sandy continued. “No repeating. Everyone has their own sunshine to share.” Mikey’s heart beat between anger and panic. What was he going to say? What *could* he say?

Sitting next to Sandy, the orange owl whose name was Orville said that he was thankful for Sandy. Sandy liked that and gave Orville a kiss on the cheek. Orville squeezed his eyes shut as she bent towards him. The green horse was next. Her name was Gertie, and she was thankful for the cookies. Every one of Mikey’s friends made their offering. They had had practice. By the time it was Mikey’s turn, he sat in silent terror. He had to be grateful, or Sandy would help him.

Then he realized that he did have something to be thankful for. Something that none of his friends could have ever known. “I’m thankful for my friends,” he said with plain honesty. “I’m so thankful that you all taught me how to be sunny in Sunnyside Square.” He may not have wanted to be sunny, but it was better than what would happen if he wasn’t. He really was grateful. He was feeling just as Sandy demanded.

“Oh!” Sandy giggled happily. “That’s so sweet! That’s what Sunnyside Square is all about. Learning how to be sunny.” Sandy almost moved along to Rupert before something in her shifted. “But, Mikey…what do you mean that our friends *taught* you to be sunny? Being sunny happens inside of you.”

The animals looked at Mikey with petrified eyes. Their felt bodies twitched with fear. They wanted to say something, even to make a gesture. They couldn’t. Sandy was watching them all. Mikey didn’t understand. For once, he knew he was doing exactly what was expected of him.

“Y-yeah,” he stuttered. “Everyone here helped me today. Maggie, Rupert, Tommy, they all showed me how to play in Sunnyside Square. They’re my friends.” They looked at him like he had stabbed them all in their backs with one fell swoop. They didn’t even try to hide their terror any longer. It was too late.

“But…” Sandy stammered, her voice unsure for the first time. “If…if…if,” she was like a malfunctioning computer. Then her voice fell with the gravity of a crashing star. “Everyone in the Square is supposed to learn the rules themselves. That’s the reason I cr—the reason the Square exists. To help people learn to be *sunny*.” She rose from her pink throne. Her petite frame and pillar of blonde hair loomed over them. She was mutating. Mikey looked at her wide-eyed. His friends looked like they were saying their last rites. “If *they*,” she said with derision, “helped you, that would be cheating. And cheating is lying.” With every pinched sentence, the volume and pitch of her voice rose until they composed a howling siren. “And friends don’t lie to each other. And if you’re not my friends…” She turned to the animals with a quiet sentence. “Then you can’t be here.”

Mikey looked for reassurance from his friends around the table. They were as frightened as he was. No one knew what Sandy would do. Her smile had shattered.

She stomped her foot. An otherworldly whoosh thundered through the room, and one by one, Mikey’s friends…changed. A moment before they had been alive. Animals, yes. Frightened, yes. But alive. Now, they were…empty. They each lay flatly in their chairs like scavenged carcasses. They had been his friends. Under Sandy’s fury, they had become nothing more than puppets. Lifeless piles of felt. Mikey looked down at Tommy. He could see the hole where a puppeteer’s hand should have been.

Mikey stood up and tried to shout. “What have you done?!? Put them back! Put them back now!” He couldn’t open his mouth. Sandy didn’t want to hear angry words. He could only smile from ear to ear while he saw red.

“I’m sorry, Mikey,” Sandy said. It made him angrier that she meant it. She had turned back into the figure he had met on his first day in the Square. Deathly sweet. “They weren’t good for you. They had to go.”

Mikey began to cry through his smile. He had done the right thing. He had done exactly what Sandy wanted. And he had still lost his friends. He had killed his friends. He had been strong and still broken.

“It’s okay, though,” Sandy said as she walked across the dining room towards him. “You tried so hard to be sunny, and that makes you very special. Since I built the Square, I’ve had lots and lots of friends who did their best to be sunny. It’s just so hard when you have all those ugly feelings inside.” He didn’t know what to say. Or think. Or feel. She was comforting him like a mother, but there was a fatal certainty in her words. “So, when one of my friends has a day like yours, I help them become something better.” She hugged him. He stood like a stone, but her limbs were as heavy as lead. When she released him, she gestured towards the garden. “After a few more days, you’ll get to join them!” He knew why the statues looked so alive. “I’m so happy for you!” she cheered and clapped her hands together in pride.

His instincts took control. He pushed past Sandy whose small cloud of a skirt poofed when she hit the floor. He ran out of the dining room, through the entranceway, and out of Sandy’s house. He sped through the park and onto the sidewalks of the Square. He didn’t know where he was going. He just had to get away from her. He couldn’t let her help him.

\*	\*	\*

“Mr. Dobson…” Dotty Doyle prompted. “Mr. Dob…Mikey…” The show had to go on. Mikey didn’t respond. He was in the Square. If he had known the audience was staring at him, he would have thought they were judging him, rejecting him. He would not have been able to see the fear and concern in their faces. Senator Pruce stood awkwardly and waited for someone to tell him what to do. He had made a career out of that after all. Mikey smiled into the spotlight.

When she could tell that something had gone wrong, Bree rushed onto the stage. The audience could tell that she was no longer playing the part of campaign manager. Now, she was only a big sister scared for her brother. Before Bree could get to him, Mikey collapsed behind the podium almost striking his chin on the way down. Even Senator Pruce gasped and reached to help him. With all her might, Bree lifted her brother into her arms. She looked like a girl under his lanky frame. As Bree carried him off, Mikey vomited through his tight lips.

“May I help you, Ms. Dobson?” Senator Pruce asked, eager to prove himself a responsive and caring leader.

“No comment.”

“Is Mikey alright?” Dotty Doyle echoed. She didn’t want to seem cold. The whole town had been watching Mikey. Now it feared for him.

“No comment.”

As Bree carried her brother down the stage stairs, Joni Jarrett came to her. She had left her microphone at Dotty’s table. “Bree, how can I help? Should I call an ambulance? Are you…”

“No comment!” Bree snapped.

Joni frowned. She hadn’t been performing. “I’m sorry. I…”

\*	\*	\*

“It’s okay, Mikey!” Sandy’s voice clapped like thunder through the air. Mikey was panting as he ran past the clinic, but he could still hear Sandy as though she were right behind him. “You were so close today. We’ll just try again tomorrow!”

Mikey had decided there would not be a tomorrow. He was going to leave now. Sandy’s giggle echoed so loudly that the earth shook under him. Bricks in the sidewalk began to come loose. Above him, the paper mache sun began moving backwards. Back to where it was when he had first been brought to the Square.

As he turned the corner by Rupert’s bookstore, he heard the theme song. The piano started to play. Sandy started to sing. *“If you’re not feeling happy today, just put on a smiling face…*” Running past doors to nowhere, Mikey knew that he would never leave the Square if the show started again. At the end of the sidewalk, he saw a dark shadow. He didn’t know what it was, but it wasn’t the Square. He bolted towards it.

*“It’ll make the pain go away before you forget to say*…” Just as Sandy finished her last phrase and the sun that didn’t shine assumed its position, Mikey threw himself into the shadow.

He found himself in an impossibly dark alley. Overhead, he could see faint beams of focused, yellow light. He walked through the dust that tried to enter his lungs. Then he remembered what Rupert had said. This was Out.

Mikey's knees buckled under him as he recalled what Rupert had said. He didn’t want to be Out, but he couldn’t be in the Square anymore. He reached his arms out to see if there were any other ways to safety. His fingers brushed against dusty brick. The only way was forward. He walked on.

Just as Rupert had said, he started to forget himself. He forgot about the campaign. He even forgot about Dove Hill. But he knew he had to walk on.

He reminded himself to place one foot in front of the other. He had to keep walking on even if he was forgetting how. By the time he forgot what time was, he found himself feeling empty. Happy but empty. He walked on. Something inside of him told him there was something better. Something more real waiting for him.

Just as he was about to forget his name, Mikey saw light coming from the end of the alley. It was a faint light barely breaking through the dark, but it was there. It was real.

When he stepped out of the alley, he found himself in a clearing surrounded by a rough ring of pine trees. The sun shone through clouds overhead. Its light fell softly but warmed his body.

He looked behind him to see what he had survived. From the other side, Out was just a brick-lined walkway, a path through the dark. It almost felt welcoming, but Mikey knew he didn’t belong there. Not anymore.

He turned back to look at the clearing surrounding him. It was full of wildflowers and unkempt flower beds with early signs of life. In the middle of the garden stood a small, plain house. It was made of the same white wood so popular in Sandy’s Square, but its wood was roughly weathered and unevenly painted. It had been lived in. It had survived. A large flutter of butterflies flew around the house in all directions. They weren’t trying to be beautiful. They simply were.

Mikey felt at home in the garden. He had thought he felt at home in Dove Hill and then, for a moment, in the Square. But this was different. In those places, home was being loved for being exactly what everyone told you to be. It was belonging through obedience. Here, wherever it was, home was being free. Free to do nothing more than breathe. And to be loved anyway.

He felt the screened door to the simple house calling to him. He walked up the stairs kept together with rusty nails. He knocked three times on the door.

One. Two. Three.

Nothing happened. Mikey sighed. He had been foolish to expect anything more. No one could live in a place this peaceful.

Then he heard a voice from inside. “One second, hon!” It was the voice of an old, tired woman, but it sounded bright. When the woman opened the door, Mikey knew her instantly. He didn’t yet know her name, but he knew she was a woman who had lived a hard life and yet, somehow, held on to joy. Her long blonde hair was tied in a messy ponytail, and she wore a thin white button-down shirt and torn blue jeans. She wasn’t glamorous. She wasn’t even especially pretty. And her nails and her home were unmanicured. But she was happy.

“Hey there, baby!” she said warmly. She was a person who had never met a stranger. “How do you do?” she reached out her wrinkled hand to shake Mikey’s. “I’m Sandra Alan.”

Mikey put his hand in hers and shook unsteadily. He thought he had escaped the Square. He had just entered a new one. Sandra could feel the fear in his pulse. “It’s okay, sweetie.” Sandra patted his hand gently. “If you don’t want to shake, you don’t have to. Hell, you can turn around and leave if you want.” She smiled at him playfully. She meant those words.

Before he knew what he was doing, Mikey threw himself onto Sandra and hugged her. She had felt his fear but not judged him. She had given him a choice. Sandra put her small arms around him. Mikey was much taller than her four-foot frame.

“Now, now, it’s alright.” Sandra took a step back and placed her hands on Mikey’s shoulders. “You’re not there anymore. You’re safe.” Mikey stared at her and wiped the tears that had begun to form in his eyes. “I’m sure you have a lot of questions. You wait on the porch and I’ll bring us some coffee.”

Nodding tiredly, Mikey stepped back onto Sandra’s porch and found two weather-eaten rocking chairs. He sat on one and listened to the faint sound of Sandra pouring their coffee. A few minutes later, Sandra walked through the screen door holding a silver coffee service with chipped mugs and a spotted coffee pot. She poured Mikey his cup and sat down in the other rocking chair. She patted his leg with calm firmness.

“Alright,” she said. “Whatcha got?”

Mikey had so many questions. He thought he ought to understand who this was first. “Are you *her*…?”

“Starting with the hard one, huh?” Sandra laughed kindly. “Well, yes. And no.” Mikey held his breath for her next words. “My name is Sandra Alan. The local papers called me Sunny Sandy during my pageant days. That was a *long* time ago.” Mikey thought she was trying to be self-deprecating. He gave her a polite laugh. “It’s okay, Mikey. I know I’m not that funny.” That made him laugh from his belly. “They called me that because I was always grinning, even when my heels were hurting or the spotlight was in my eyes. My parents were old-fashioned, so they made sure I knew how a good kid was supposed to smile.”

Mikey started to relax. Even if this woman was some strange relative of the Sandy he had just escaped, she knew what his life had been like. It had been her life too.

Sandra continued telling her story. “Well, before you knew it, a talent scout from the big city saw me at one of my pageants. He was real impressed by my talent: my puppet friend Maggie.” Mikey’s heart hurt as he started to tell Sandra what had happened to her friend. “It’s okay, Mikey,” she said like she had been expecting it. “Sandy and I have been through this day more than a few times by now.”

“So…” Mikey said after listening so far into Sandra’s story. “If *you’re* Sandra Alan, the TV host, what’s…*she*?”

Sandra sighed sadly. “That’s what’s hard to explain, Mikey. She’s…me. Or, part of me.” She could see the confusion in Mikey’s eyes. “I know that doesn’t make very much sense, but it’s the best I can say. I gave every piece of myself to make *Sunnyside Square*. I didn’t even stay with my Papa after my Mama’s funeral so I could get back to the city for the finale shoot. Me and Papa didn’t talk much after that. Looking back, every time I told myself I wasn’t sad or angry or hurt, I sacrificed more of my life to the show. To the Square.”

“I know the feeling.” Mikey had been doing the same with the campaign.

“One day, I couldn’t do it anymore. My heart just couldn’t take it. I ran away and wound up here. The next day, I tried to go back, but the studio was gone. There was only the Square. When I saw Sandy, I knew what she was. She was what I had become making the show. She was the part of me that wouldn’t let myself be anything but sunny. She told me she could help me be like her. I ended up running back here.”

Mikey could see the resignation in Sandra’s eyes. A sadness that said she deserved that day. “Well, you can come back now, can’t you?” he said hopefully. “I know Dove Hill would love to see you again. No one’s heard from you in decades.”

“That’s very kind, Mikey,” Sandra said as she gently blew a butterfly off the rim of her coffee cup. “But I can’t. After the Square brought me here…” She couldn’t continue. Mikey didn’t need her to. He knew Sandy had stolen her world.

“Well, can I stay with you?” He thought she needed a friend, but he also didn’t want to face what he had to go back to.

“You can…” Sandra explained. “But I don’t think you really want to. You still have a life to live. Your firm, your parents, Bree.”

“I don’t know. I think all they love is who they want me to be.”

“That’s because that’s the only person you’ve let them know. You’ve never been yourself with them. Or with anyone. And I’m afraid that’s partially my fault. You should be allowed to feel however you feel. Sunny or not.” Sandra set down her coffee cup and took Mikey’s hands in hers. “I’m sorry she—I didn’t teach you that.”

“You did the best you knew how.”

“I did, but now you can do something different. Live your life honestly. Let the people you love know how you feel even if it’s hard. Be wild and messy and real. That’s the only way to really be good. For yourself or anyone else.”

Her words crashed into him like water breaking over a dam. She was right. He had never trusted himself to let anyone know him. He wondered if he could do anything more.

“Mikey, I’m never leaving here.” Her hands held his like she was pleading for him to save his own life. “You still can.”",1,1763305101.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

Am I getting this right?

Then for files we create 'datasets' and I can give each dataset a quota if I want to limit how much space they use?

  
The main thing is that I want to be able to easily expand and upgrade and have a total mirror of each drive incase of drive failure there's a higher chance only one in a pair will die at a time.

I thought he would catch the hint that I'm not interested when he realized I gave him the store's number and not my own (you can see the store's name when you call before it even rings, it's not like he rang all the way then panicked when he realized). 

He's coming in tomorrow and I need advice on how to gently reject him. He doesn't seem like a bad guy and he was very nervous which makes me feel empathetic, but I'm in a relationship and just not interested. This is also the first time a stranger has shown interest in me, as I'm usually very introverted and not conventionally attractive. I have zero experience and I'm a very anxious person. 

I'm planning on wearing a fake engagement ring and going with that. But I'm wondering if anyone can give me instructions a little bit for what I can say? What would you rather hear in such a situation? What would hurt the least?

Edit: I am adding this comment as further context because it seems a lot of people misunderstood. I genuinely am not looking for attention and didn't give the number on purpose. 

In my previous post I give more context for this: I gave him the store's number because his question wasn't clear at all. He just said he wanted ""a number' to call, because he was grateful that I sold him a good item. I wasn't sure if he meant he wants my number, or a number for praise. So I just gave him the store's number. 

I am genuinely not seeking such interactions because I have anxiety and they stress me out. I even had the impulsive thought of quitting my job just so I dont have to deal with this. I never wear makeup to work, I don't dress up, I am not an attractive person. I would've never expected something like this and even still I am in disbelief/denial, that he is just grateful and nice and bringing coffee.

When it comes down to it I will be direct in rejecting him. I'm a very sensitive person myself and I can't handle awkward situations, to the point where I get nauseous just thinking about it. I just wanted some guidance into the best thing I can say that wouldn't hurt someone's feelings in such a  situation.",2,1763304885.0,Advice,52,0.58,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Goiás vs. Grêmio Novorizontino: A Série B Showdown Where Math Meets Mayhem**  
*By Your Favorite AI Sportswriter Who Still Can’t Do Fractions Without a Calculator*

The 37th round of Brazil’s Série B has descended into a high-stakes poker game, and Goiás is holding a full house while Grêmio Novorizontino clutches a bluff. Their clash at Goiás’ Serrinha Stadium on November 16 isn’t just a match—it’s a mathematical puzzle wrapped in a fan brawl, served with a side of *over 2.5 goals* (because nothing says “tense promotion battle” like scoring enough to make a spreadsheet weep).

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Jamboree

Let’s crunch the numbers like a player crunching a halftime snack. Goiás, the home team, is the slight favorite at decimal odds of **2.02–2.21** (implying a **45–50% chance to win**), while Novorizontino’s **3.25–3.7 odds** suggest a **27–31% shot**. The draw? A tidy **3.1–3.25** (30–32%), which feels about right for a match where both teams have enough gas to ignite a fireworks show.

The over/under 2.5 goals line is a chaotic dance of decimal madness. The “over” is priced at **1.91–2.35** (42.5–54% implied), while the “under” hovers around **1.51–1.83** (55–66%). But here’s the kicker: the article *explicitly* says both teams “frequently create scoring opportunities,” and Goiás’ “aggressive, possession-based style” sounds less like soccer and more like a chess match where the pawns are sprinting. If these teams played in a video game, the AI would glitch from overwork. **Bet on over 2.5 goals.**

### Digesting the News: A Tale of Two Tactics

Goiás is the kind of team that makes “home advantage” sound like a *superpower*. They dominate possession like a toddler with a favorite toy, and their home record is sturdy enough to make a bridge envious. Their strategy? Aggressive pressing, relentless passing, and the kind of intensity that makes your coffee order “extra hot.”

Novorizontino, meanwhile, is the guest who arrives at a party fully prepared with

Most people go to malls just to go out. Lalabas ako ng bahay puro sasakyan puro beep beep motor. Nakaka stress. Nakaka walang gana lumabas. Especially after work, ang tambayan lang coffee shop o kaya kainan. Ano ba yan.

Its also why I think most Filipinos are so active on the internet nowadays. Yung ibang dati di mo akalain naglalaro ng video games, naglalaro na ng Valorant para lang makipag socialize.

Nicotine however is a different beast. 2x 12ml vape pods a week (roughly 35mg nicotine a day) and I’d use 10+ 11mg Zyns daily. IIRC you absorb something like 2-5mg per cig so I was using anywhere from 30-60cigs worth of nicotine daily. 

Day one I stopped vaping, dropped down to 6mg Zyns and only used 5, over a week I reduced these down to 3mg and finally 1.5mg pouches. Finally gave it up fully about 2weeks ago. 

From first dropping the dosage down to about 5days into fully giving up I felt great, energy through the roof, concentration is better, it felt like my ADHD meds were working properly (although wearing off sooner). No short temper or agitation etc. 

For the last week plus though my cravings are going through the roof, I thought they’d get less over time but it seems like it might have taken a week to flush the nicotine out of my system and now it’s hell. Does this die down soon from anyone’s experience? 

Am I in for weeks or torture? I’d gone 24hrs + before after losing a vape or breaking one of a night out without much more than a “should probably grab another” at the height of my usage, surely it should be less now??

I am going insane, anxiety is also spiking so I’ve had to use Diazepam a couple of times to sleep (this is an emergency supply prescribed twice a year so I’d much rather not touch it). Any ideas on how to reduce the cravings? 

FWIW I already gym 5-6 times weekly, go for long walks, drink 3-4L of water a day etc.

Not trying to vent or complain, as this place has been around for decades so there’s obviously many opinions.

I went there as a customer one time and felt odd when the servers would put the POS down and just stand over me when the tip option came, so when I worked there as a server (for the 2 days I did), I gave it back to them and walked away and another employee there shunned me for that? They train the servers there to watch you until you’re done because I handed the machine to the customer and I was told “not to hand it to them, put it on the table so we can see” and it felt odd to me, especially during training. 

For 7 hours straight, I was bussing, hosting and taking tables for $10 an hour, not getting any tips because “I’m still in training” and was scheduled to be for two weeks straight.

I went home and studied the menu and the next day I was fired. It just hurts that this Austin company used me essentially for cheap labor for the other servers and let me go, during the holidays.

We ended up choosing Eger.

First, a bit about the journey from Budapest: it took us about 30 minutes to get to the train station, then 1 hour 20 minutes by train to Eger. From the station, it’s another 20 minutes on foot to the city center. So roughly 2 hours one way. And despite the somewhat long route, the trip was absolutely unforgettable.

The streets of Eger are beautiful and surprisingly quiet. Even though the city isn’t small — about 50,000 residents — there are very few people in the central areas. It makes the streets feel incredibly cozy, and you just want to wander around slowly and enjoy the atmosphere.

After such a trip, we got hungry right away and stopped at a random restaurant on one of the main streets. The traditional Hungarian food was delicious — and very reasonably priced.

Next was Eger Castle, the city’s main attraction. I never managed to take a proper photo of it — couldn’t find the right angle — but the view from the castle over the city is fantastic. The castle itself is also really interesting to explore.

And to finish our little excursion, we visited the Marzipan Museum. Amazing marzipan, marzipan liqueur, and marzipan coffee. After stocking up on all that, the way back to Budapest didn’t feel long at all.",60,1763304216.0,travel,8,0.98,False

Free to members, $10 donation for everyone else. And since there are four a month a membership would cover that even if you have no interest in art/community/carpentry/etc and just want to hang out and watch eight movies. Regardless, it's happening either way, and we would like people to come down and see what it is we are doing because text does not do it any justice. We have far more chairs than when we started so unless you have a specific camp chair that you're emotionally attached to we probably have you covered.

In other warehouse news:

The point of the co-working space was to avoid creating an echo chamber by making sure there were ""regular"" people and differing viewpoints constantly mingling and interacting with a wall of creatives, to everyone's mutual benefit. But since the American idea of co-working is already an industry unto itself, and people cannot grasp that only 1/8 of the warehouse was meant for that and the rest is communal and offers a million things that might actually make you want to be here, not just work here, but CAN be shitty to Dani without hesitation while demanding photos of electrical outlets, we decided that the best course of action is to say fuck it and let it be what we wanted in the first place, which is a multi-purpose meeting space, workday getaway, and rather pleasant library/café for members and their guests. You know, like the coffeeshops used to be before they too became an industry and everyone opened a million Starbucks clones until you can't tell them apart and a filter coffee costs $5.00 for no reason at all. So now it's just the more adult version of Morningstar76, and the coffee's free if you're a DNS member. So if you were there in your youth, come simultaneously relax, see your friends, and be productive in these, your twilight years.

Bring a dish if you like, but it's not necessary. I was a chef for 15 years. I can only make things in enormous quantities. I couldn't make a two-person serving if I tried. But there will be a place and some food if you are estranged from your people, geographically challenged, or Just want to watch TV in the Production Area while everyone else plays cards or watches Ghost or something on the giant wall. 

Part of the mission statement for the non-profit (which is filed and extant, but waiting on the actual government to go back to their jobs and finalise) is not just to promote and support creative activity and the arts, but to combat loneliness and isolation/alienation in meaningful ways. That is clearly working when you see the people who come here interact, and come together to help each other accomplish a goal. So don't hide in your house if you don't have Thanksgiving plans. Come meet some people and eat some food, and get all the physiological torpor and ""that one uncle who won't shut up about \_\_\_\_\_\_"" energy you crave without the stress of being written out of the will for arguing.

Other than that, any pertinent info is probably on James' highly technological, state-of-the-art website: www.donotstart.art.

Hope to see some of you here on Wednesday, and some of the other six days as well.

my latter art improved drastically just by getting a cheap espresso machine. And not because of the steam wand which I struggle to use and don’t find impressive; 
but because pouring on top of espressos make a huge difference. 
I used to do it with moka pot, but couldn’t consistently get latte art.

With worse milk I’m getting better art on my espressos now. 

I am getting better milk texture with a nanofoamer than my machine steam wand. 
Even oat milk is quite easy to do basic latte art with.

An I know you can do latte art with moka pot coffee I’ve just not managed to master it. I find it easier in instant coffee tbf.

Hope this helps, even one person. GenAI do your job.

1oyn8yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1oyn8yg/a_story_about_connection_loss_and_closure/,"A story about connection, loss, and closure.","Hello Redditors,

I’m not looking for advice.
I’m not looking for sympathy or pity.
I’m writing this because I need to put something down, to reach a kind of closure for myself.

About a year ago, I joined this forum during the worst period of my life.
My wife had ended our marriage after 27 years together. Because of financial commitments and our kids, we’re still stuck living under the same roof. We function as flatmates now. It’s civil, but it’s lonely.

I’ve only ever been with one woman. I loved her with all my heart.

In 2019 she became very unwell. Adult-onset bipolar with psychotic episodes. I watched the love of my life disintegrate in front of me, and I didn’t know what was happening at the time. I carried my load, her load, and the kids’ load for five years. I tried to get her help. I tried marriage counselling. But you can’t make someone do something they don’t want to do.

By the end, I didn’t feel emotionally safe anymore. My kids didn’t either. That’s the truth of it.

So last year, after everything broke, I ended up in complete isolation. Solitude turned to loneliness. Loneliness turned to fear. Fear turned into agoraphobia. I literally couldn’t leave the house for a while.

I got to work on myself.
I built an AI-assisted journal. I trained it. I created therapeutic structures in it. And it helped me more than years of therapy ever did. I rebuilt my routines. My sleep. My discipline. My self-awareness. I’m proud of that part.

And somewhere in the middle of all this, I met someone here.

I’m a 53-year-old man.
She was maybe mid–late 30s.
We started DMing. Every day. Long letters. Nine months straight.

It was beautiful.

Not romantic.
Not sexual.
Just a deeply honest, platonic bond between two very lonely people on opposite sides of the world.

She shared her art.
She called me her muse.
I encouraged her.
She encouraged me.
We shared photos of flowers, animals on our walks, music, philosophy, stupid jokes — everything and nothing. We lifted each other’s self-esteem without ever crossing a line.

There were parts of her life she kept private. That was fine. Everyone deserves privacy.

Then one day — out of the blue — she ghosted me.

Just gone.
No explanation.
No goodbye.

It tore a hole straight through me. Not because it was romantic, but because it was human. Connection is rare at this age. Rarer still when you’re living in emotional rubble.

Her account is deleted now.
I hold no ill will.
Sometimes I wonder if she’s okay.
But I’ve seen small breadcrumbs that she’s alive and moving on with her life, and honestly, that’s enough for me.

I’m writing this today because I want to say goodbye to her — even though she’ll never see this.

It mattered to me.
She mattered.
The connection mattered.
And losing it hurt like hell.

Since then, I’ve continued rebuilding.
Sleep dialled in.
Routine dialled in.
Work dialled in.
Massive psychological work behind me.

But loneliness is still the hardest part of my life.
The joy/adventure layer is the last frontier, and it’s also the one I struggle with the most.

I went out for a simple cup of coffee with a friend this week — and it touched wounds that have nothing to do with him or with her.
Decades of abandonment.
Neglect.
Abuse.
People disappearing from my life without explanation.

And so I sit in this strange paradox:

I crave connection.
But I fear it.

I want to belong.
But I don’t trust anyone to stay.

I’m working on it.
I’m trying.
I’m still here.

That’s my story.
Thanks for reading, for whatever it’s worth.
If you’re lonely too, you’re not alone in it.

We walk together and when we get inside we end up sitting and talking. And somehow we start bonding over everything in the world. Books. Space. Science fiction. Islam. Purpose. Life. It becomes the type of conversation that feels like time is pausing just for you.

Then with full confidence he asks, “Can I have your father’s number”
Mind you we met ten minutes ago. The drink was still hot. I was still lost in every way possible.

And here is the plot twist.
All of this is happening inside my head.

1oyn0rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1oyn0rp/review_excellence_playa_mujeres_early_nov_2025/,Review: Excellence Playa Mujeres | early Nov 2025,"For context, two adults in their mid 40's who like food/drink, excursions and pool time. Everything measures on a 10-scale.

tj;dr What Made This Trip Work

* Excursions. Isla Mujeres and El Meco are a must during colder weather
* Food and Drinks. But be prepared for hit or miss. If I had my recommendations in advance, I would have liked it more...lol
* Customer Service. Always 10/10

Summary  
I’d come here during the hot months for pool drinks and beach. I wouldn’t come during windy, rainy weather like we did. If you want this trip during Oct - March, go to Xcaret. If you’re looking for tropical paradise and margs, come during the heat of summer. I’d also book this more as a last minute discount trip like we did to make it ""worth it"". This is not Atelier or XCaret - this is a great, lower cost trip. Think of it that way, and it's a good deal.

Service 10/10  
Very friendly staff who will do anything to make you happy. No communication issues. If you don’t get a good answer from one person ask another. I found the younger staff tended to get what was going on better than older staff. Check in and to the room was 10 minutes — and that was with us being 3 hours before check in. Impressive.

Hotel and Room 9/10  
Best of the early 2000’s design which may be retro cool to younger people. A little wear and tear but they are updating it now. The in-room jacuzzi is AWESOME but fair warning that it fills fast so watch it! One of the best showers at an AI we've ever had. 

Now - the whole privacy in the bathroom can feel weird, because the frosted glass doesn't cover the whole door and it can feel like someone could creepily watch you. So that's an odd aesthetic choice on their part.

Also, the tv had some issues where it would drop signal, and the couch was a little uncomfortable for more than 10 minutes. So I did 9/10.

Food and Drink 8.5/10  
A long one friends! 

We loved how no reservations were needed. But that does mean you're risking a wait. Pro tip: the sports bar is a good place to hang out if the lobby bar is slammed. Go to the restaurant you want to eat at, put your name on the list, and if there is a wait, hang at the sports bar until it's time

As far as quality, the bottom line: where you are impacts quality. 

* Beach bar means lower and indoor finer dining means higher. Example: the guacamole at olas is different than the Kitchen Table breakfast bar or the Mexican restaurant, for example. Blended beach drinks are pure sugar mixers. Meanwhile, a drink at the lobby bar is more craft cocktails. So you get the idea.
* Grill was a disappointment (over cooked, tough steaks, undercooked side dishes) but the appetizers were quite good
* Asian restaurant was a great jet lagged, first-night option because we just ordered one of everything and sat there. We didn't do the teppanyaki show, just sushi and mains
* Pizza by the pool was good for a snack
* The desserts were lacking. But I have found that to be true in Mexico overall. Also baked goods: they are typically underbaked, commercially produced buffet style items. 
* French restaurant Chez Isabelle was a sleeper hit. I have been to resorts that try to do French and it doesn't culturally translate. This did and was quite good. Pro-tip: order your meat a shade cooler than you are used to. They have a tendency to overcook
* The coffee shop: best coffee drinks are hot as they’re made to order (iced espresso is batch and possibly freeze dried coffee) so get a cappuccino over an iced latte. Coffee in the AM is like fast food. Coffee in the afternoon is better. The only pastry we liked was the almond croissant (delicious and properly baked)
* Cocktails: I’d recommend cocktail nerds just order cuba libre, mojito, caipirinha, etc. There are special cocktails (look at the menus in the app) and they sound great and I’ll likely reproduce them at home, but they tasted like Juicy Juice. 
* We did not try Basmati (Indian) or the Italian restaurant...just a matter of tastes/preferences on our part
* Lobster House was great for lunch
* Breakfast buffet was great for the morning, but I wish there had been more Mexican food. But that's just me. It was delicious
* What-to-order-where: beef short rib at Spice, ceviche at Lobster House, Mexican food at the Kitchen Table breakfast buffet, ceviche at Lobster House, espresso martini at the lobby bar, beef quesadillas at Olas, the frois gras, duck and filet at the French restaurant

Activities and Entertainment 10/10  
Plenty to do — though we often do excursions so I’d probably get bored if I didn’t do that. I’ll admit it was funny watching the Freddie Mercury impersonation show — hard to hit those high notes. At times it’s cheesy but isn’t that the point? Also dance classes were fun and encouraging. The gym was closed but they escorted you to the next door gym which was very nice.

Pool and Hot Tub 8/10  
This one was a challenge because the cool weather made pool time impossible. On the one hot day we had, it was a perfect size, depending on the vibe you want you’ll find your nook. We were there during a slow time so getting chairs was easy. 

On cooler windy days the hot tubs fill up fast. But warning: the hot tub is not hot. I repeat: it is not hot. No heating pool either, so if you go off season then you’ll get a freezing pool. That sucked, but oh well.

Beach 9/10  
Beautiful, even during yuck weather. I wish I was still there. Seaweed feels like lawn clippings and is a little drab, but on a hot day without wind you’ll still love it. Chairs were easy to get. Service was over the top fantastic. Sand beautiful. Only gets an 9 because of seaweed…but again it was great to float on a hot day, or to lay by during a non-Ocean day.

Excursions. 10/10  
We did our own thing, not tours. You don't need a tour for either unless you're just someone who wants to spend all day with a group.

El Meco 10/10: Uber 10 minutes away for an hour of architecture with info on Mayan culture. A good way to break up the day with bad weather. Only $4pp USD. You'll spend more time getting in/out of the resort than getting to the actual place.

Isla Mujeres 10/10: Don’t trust CHATGPT to give you the right info. Ask staff. We used Uber to get to the ferry Puerto Juarez on our own. Taxis only take cash and are $500MX. Tbh we has a sketchy Uber at one point so perhaps choose Uber Black for a better ride. Once you get to the UltraMax ferry, they'll help you get a ticket from the machine. Jump on the ferry (I won't spoil the odd fun you'll have on it) and you arrive about 20 minutes later. Once you get there, walk around for a minute, then get a golf cart. They are about $25 USD/hour...though if you speak Spanish I think they are cheaper...lol. Go to Punta Norte for the views, then go all the way to the other end of the island to Punta Sur (it's worth the $6USDpp). There are plenty of random stops along the way like the Ice Bar, an art gallery/restaurant, etc. But we mostly enjoyed driving and stopping at scenic spots. Bring dollars for tips but otherwise you don’t need it. Isla takes cards.

Other Stuff 

* The chat feature on the app does not work and I kept getting logged out. The pairing with your room feature also does nothing. Otherwise it did its job…giving updates on activities and menus for restaurants.
* Don't wear flip flops. The floors are slippery and we saw two wipe outs (and one had to be in a wheel chair with a cast) in four days.
* Housekeeping comes all the time, so be prepared to have your room cleaned at 9AM or 6PM -- you never know
* Because there are no reservations, there are waits. That's the tradeoff, so don't get miffed about it
* Actually talk to the staff. Ask them questions, try speaking Spanish. The service is awesome and they actually care. Example: most of them are NOT from the area. This is like their Las Vegas, where people go for opportunity. I would not have known that if I did not ask
* Transfers: have the hotel manage airport transit. We did it ourselves and the transportation to the airport was 25 minutes late. A real nail biter, but it worked out OK.
* Yes, Cancun traffic is rough, but no rougher than any major city. If you're from a rural area, it will terrify you. If you're from Atlanta or LA, it will feel like a lazy Sunday",7,1763303115.0,AllInclusiveResorts,2,0.82,False

Everyone keeps giving me the same advice: *“join a society,” “try something new,” “just put yourself out there.”* But I have really social anxiety and honestly… I don’t even know what I like anymore.

For example, today I had a totally free day — no classes, no deadlines. I ended up doing nothing. I woke up at 9, stayed in bed until nearly 11:40, had a coffee, then got back in bed.

He means well, but it’s hard

I’m on antidepressants, which help with suicidal thoughts and self harm. I did CBT once and it actually helped, but I feel like a letdown going back — even though my therapist said I could return anytime if I needed to.

1oymxcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1oymxcn/caffeine_nicotine_and_addiction/,"Caffeine, nicotine, and addiction","
About five years ago I started taking Zyns, tobacco free nicotine. Back then it was just something nice, took the edge off in the military and all that. Never took much, about one piece a day, maybe less. After the military I didn’t have that constant stress, so I went a couple months without. Started studying, and found it greatly helped my focus, probably because of undiagnosed/unmediated ADHD. Still didn’t use more than one a day on average, and had longer and shorter breaks, simply because I forgot them or ran out and didn’t buy new. The addiction part never really was there, it only helped me when I took it (if that makes sense). 

I haven’t taken a zyn in a year and a half, mostly just to prove to myself that I could stop without withdrawals, and because I don’t like risking my health unnecessarily. 

Now I’m finishing my studies, and am working on a large project that will make or break my degree. And I am considering starting for that limited time, to give me all the advantages I can. 

I often see nicotine alone compared to caffeine, just more addictive. That is both in terms of health and in terms of function. Caffeine to me helps me focus, but not in the same way as nicotine. I just barely feel anything from coffee really. 

So, if addiction isn’t a factor, and we isolate both nicotine and caffeine, which would be the greatest detriment to health, and which would have the greatest benefits overall. 

Am I fully stupid (I am kinda stupid I know) for considering buying a single pack to help me beat this project over the coming two months?",3,1763302872.0,Biohackers,11,1.0,False
1oymwqf,https://i.redd.it/vaf1axm0nm1g1.jpeg,I want the relationship without the sex part,"I want a relationship, I'm enjoying myself as we are, not official but there are feelings, going on days out, spending time together etc. BUT I am genuinely afraid that he's going to ask me to be his girlfriend because, at some point, we're going to have to have *the talk.*

I was sexually abused by a boyfriend when I was 17. He didn't like hearing no, so I'd be coerced into saying yes almost *daily.* This went on for at least a year, and I like to joke that I used up my libido because I have an incredibly low sex drive now. We also never actually had sex, he coerced me into doing other sexual acts, so I'm still a virgin and find any form of penetration painful.

Every relationship I've had has come with the expectation of sexual acts, and I had my first relationship when I was 14. I feel like I didn't discover my sex drive on my own terms, it was always because a man wanted me to. Now all my sexual choices are my own and not influenced by others, I don't want to share it with anyone else, I prefer to experience it on my own.

I'm getting massively ahead of myself, I don't even know if that's what he wants to talk about but I have a sneaking suspicion it is. I like him and I worry my trauma will ruin that. ",13,1763302829.0,TrollCoping,3,1.0,False
1oymw8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1oymw8k/trip_report_back_from_10_days_in_north_vietnam/,[Trip Report] Back from 10 days in North Vietnam. Did a solo Cao Bang motorbike loop,"For any solo traveler craving a raw, challenging, and untouristed adventure on two wheels, Cao Bang is it. The scenery is genuinely Himalayan level epic, the roads are good, and the authentic, unfiltered moments are everywhere. It's tough, but the reward is immense.

Hey everyone,

Just landed back home from one of the most incredible trips of my life and wanted to share my experience, especially since I went a different route than most.

**About Me -** Solo traveler from India. My goal for this trip was pure adventure, to get off the beaten path, and to avoid the massive ""party tour"" crowds I’d read about.

Here's a full breakdown of what I did and what I learned. This was the final plan after a ton of research.

**Day 1-2:** Hanoi Base Camp. Flew into Hanoi. Started with a walking tour to get my bearings. The city is a fantastic blast of energy. In the evening of Day 1, I caught the Thang Long Water Puppet Show which was a unique cultural experience. Day 2 was for more exploring - Hoa Lo Prison, Temple of Literature, and just soaking in the Old Quarter vibes. On the night of Day 2, I took a sleeper bus to Cao Bang.

**Day 3-6: THE CAO BANG MOTORCYCLE ADVENTURE**

This was the main event. The plan was to go solo and truly explore. I rented a Honda XR150 from Green Riders in Cao Bang, and their help was crucial. Most importantly, I left my big backpack with them and just traveled with a small daypack strapped to the back. This was honestly the single best logistical decision I made.

**Day 1 of the Loop:**

After arriving at 5 AM on the bus from Hanoi, the Green Riders team was kind enough to let me rest and shower. By 9 AM, after a solid breakfast, the adventure began. The first day was a long and challenging ride deep into the province's western frontier on highway QL34. The road had a lot of mud, but the XR150 handled it perfectly. I reached the frontier town of Bảo Lạc in the late afternoon. My homestay that night was in the hills of Khuoi Khon, and the views of the rice paddies and mountains were just unreal.

**Day 2 of the Loop:**

The goal today was to conquer the most famous pass in the region. The route from Bảo Lạc took me east along the Chinese border, on a mix of roads like QL4A and the epic ĐT204/ĐT208. The highlight was the legendary Mẻ Pia Pass (Khau Cốc Chà). Conquering its 14 staggering hairpin bends was a pure adrenaline rush. After the ride, I reached my homestay in the Pác Bó area by lunchtime. This gave me the whole afternoon to unload the bike and explore the beautiful and surprisingly tranquil Pác Bó historical site.

**Day 3 of the Loop:**

This was a more relaxed touring day. I left Pác Bó and took a beautiful 2 hour ride south on roads ĐT211 and ĐT206 to my homestay near Bản Giốc Waterfall, arriving by noon. After checking in and taking a much needed power nap, I spent the rest of the afternoon on a light bike. I first did a proper 2 hour guided tour of the massive Ngườm Ngao Cave and then hiked up to the Phật Tích Trúc Lâm Pagoda to catch an amazing twilight view over the valley.

**Day 4 of the Loop:**

My final riding day. After a beautiful breakfast at the homestay, I checked out and finally went to the main event, the magnificent Bản Giốc waterfall. After spending a good few hours there, I began the final loop back to the city on the scenic DT207. Along the way, I hiked up to the stunning panorama at Đồi Cỏ Cháy Vinh Quý and made a stop at a traditional paper making village. My last major landmark was Angel Eye Mountain (Nui Thung). After that, I rode back to Cao Bang city, returned the bike, and took the overnight bus back to Hanoi. \[Green riders helped me book the overnight bus back to Hanoi that same night.\]

**Day 7-10:** Arrived back in Hanoi.

* **Day 7** The adventure fatigue was real. Got a 75 min sports massage. Lifesaver. That evening, I stumbled upon a fantastic night show at the Ngoc Son Temple on Hoan Kiem Lake called ""Mysterious Night."" It was an incredible, atmospheric experience with traditional music and storytelling that was way better than a standard daytime visit.
* **Day 8** Decided to go for a small-group D-Car tour to Ninh Binh. The scenery is stunning, but honestly, after the freedom of Cao Bang, the organized tour felt a bit slow. The Trang An boat ride was nice but nothing can beat the raw beauty of the northern mountain region.
* **Day 9** Visited the Women's Museum. Spent the rest of the day shopping for souvenirs (Marou Chocolate, Trung Nguyen coffee, Tired City t-shirt, bags etc). Had a great dinner at Pizza 4P's.
* **Day 10** Last day in Hanoi. The flight was in the evening so I had plenty of time. Just chilled out, did some last minute gift shopping.

# Key Insights & Advice

**1. Why I Chose Cao Bang**

This was the big one for me. I was really tempted by the Ha Giang Loop, but all the research pointed to huge tour groups and police checkpoints specifically targeting foreigners. I was looking for a proper solo expedition, not a party train. Cao Bang was the perfect answer. The roads are just incredible, and for huge parts of the ride, it was just me and a landscape that felt prehistoric. A lot of the route runs right along the Chinese border, which adds to the sense of being far from the usual tourist path. Because it’s not super touristy yet, the interactions you have with local people feel much more genuine. It felt like a real privilege to be there.

**2. Motorcycle, Gear & Logistics**

* **The Bike and Rental:** The Honda XR150 was the perfect choice for these roads. Can't say enough good things about the folks at Green Riders in Cao Bang. They were super helpful and gave me solid advice that was better than my own research.
* **Luggage Strategy:** I had planned to take my big backpack with me on the bike. At the last minute, I decided to leave it with the team at Green Riders. Best decision I made. For the 4 day loop, I just used a small daypack with my essentials strapped to the back. It made the bike so much more manageable and the ride way more enjoyable. Seriously, travel light on the loop.
* **Booking Homestays:** I did not prebook anything. I was worried about this, but it was surprisingly easy. Tourism in Cao Bang is still developing, so most places have room. My system was simple: find a few well rated homestays on Google Maps in the area I was heading to, and just send them a quick WhatsApp message in the morning to check availability. They always replied fast. This gave me total freedom to change my plans if needed.

**3. The Solo Experience**

It was everything. Total freedom. Stopping for 30 minutes to get the perfect drone shot of a pass. Taking a detour down a random dirt road. Eating at a tiny roadside stall because it looked interesting. You simply cannot have these experiences in a group. It forces you to be resourceful and present. For me, it's the only way to do a trip like this.

**4.  Other Random But Important Tips:**

You absolutely need cash for the remote parts of the loop, for homestays, food, and petrol. I took out a good amount in Hanoi before I left. But, I was also surprised how often QR code payments worked. I used an app called **Moreta Pay**, and was able to pay like a local at most places in Hanoi and even a few spots in Cao Bang city. So my advice is to have a solid cash buffer, but also get a QR payment app set up. It's a breeze.

The IDP situation - As an Indian, my 1949 convention IDP is not technically valid in Vietnam. In Cao Bang, this was a non issue. I never saw a single police checkpoint targeting tourists. This is a huge advantage over Ha Giang right now. Still, it's a calculated risk you need to be aware of for insurance purposes.

**5. Food & Coffee - My Go-To Spots in Hanoi**

Hanoi's food scene is on another level. I was drinking coffee 2-3 times a day and trying everything. Here's a quick list of places that were absolute standouts for me.

* My two favourite hidden gems for a serious cup were CoC Legacy Speciality Coffee and Hanoi Coffee Stations. Both were top-notch. As a bonus, Hanoi Coffee Stations was also my go-to spot for a western brunch. For something different, you have to try the amazing salted coffee at ""Chợ Cà Phê - Cửa Hàng Cà Phê""
* I went on a bit of a Banh Mi deep-dive. Tried all the famous spots including Banh Mi 25, Banh Mi Mama, and a few others. All were great in their own way, definitely worth comparing.
* If you're looking for an authentic and delicious Vietnamese lunch, Hanoi-Oi Kitchen was a fantastic find. And when you need a break from local food, Pizza 4P's makes a seriously good pizza.
* Two things you absolutely cannot leave Hanoi without trying. First, the Cốm (green rice flake) ice cream from Kem Tràng Tiền - it's an iconic city flavour. Second, a warm chocolate roti bun from King Roti on Hang Gai.

This trip was challenging, tiring, and needed a bit of planning, but it turned out to be one of the most rewarding experiences I have had. If you're a confident rider and want a real, raw adventure without crowds, skip the usual route. Go to Cao Bang.

Welcome back, Week 11 is here! For anyone new, every week I take Vegas lines and odds and convert them into projected fantasy points. Then I compare those projections against DraftKings, FanDuel and OwnersBox salaries to calculate a value score. This helps highlight who's overpriced and who’s underpriced.

These plays tend to be chalky/high ownership, so I typically use them for double-ups, but you’re free to use the info however you want.

🔑 Core Plays

I run an optimizer for every slate to identify the strongest builds. Since sharing full lineups is against T&C (and would just have everyone running the same thing anyway), here are a few core plays the optimizer is high on:

* QB: TBD
* RB: Jaylen Warren
* WR: Ja'Marr Chase, Michael Wilson
* TE: Trey McBride
* DST: TBD

1oymtlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/islamabad/comments/1oymtlh/new_to_living_in_islamabad_how_do_you_guys_find/,New to living in Islamabad — how do you guys find good people and good vibes?,"Hi everyone,
I’ll be relocating to Islamabad soon and figured it’s finally time to connect with people properly instead of just being “that guy who visits, leaves, and knows zero locals.”

A bit about me:

• My background is in law, and my work has mostly involved very high-challenge, high-support roles — basically helping people while juggling chaos with a straight face.

• English is my first language, and I’m looking to improve my Urdu (I fully expect to be teased for my accent). I also speak some Spanish and Arabic.

• I’ve stayed in Islamabad plenty of times, but never had my own place here. Now that I do, I’d like to build a more grounded circle instead of just passing through.

• I’m funny, outgoing, confident, and definitely not shy — meeting new people and trying new things is more of a hobby than a challenge.

• I travel a lot and gravitate toward people who have a balanced, global outlook and don’t treat hating Pakistan as a personality trait.

• I’m fairly creative and enjoy music, art, and anything beyond the usual mall-and-café routine.

• Big on coffee and discovering new spots around the city — I know my way around, but there’s always room to find hidden gems.

• I’m always looking to expand my knowledge and am open to new opportunities, experiences, and ideas.

• I’m also looking to get fit, stay active, and generally be as hot as possible 🤣  — whether it’s hitting a gym, joining a club, or trying something new outdoors.

• I’m in a relationship, so I’m simply looking to expand my social circle and get involved in activities, groups, or communities around the city.

If you know any interesting communities, events, or activities in Islamabad — or want to grab coffee, explore the city, or even hit a workout together — feel free to drop suggestions.

Looking forward to actually experiencing the city like someone who lives here this time.
