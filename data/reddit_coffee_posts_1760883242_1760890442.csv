Spent a lot of time with her over lunches and coffees as a colleague earlier. And we ended up having a lot of similar tastes, it felt like this is it. But then I moved cities to start my own venture, but we kept in touch. Finally, when I felt we both are comfortable with each other and enjoy each others company. Felt this way only the third time in my life and I mustered some courage to ask her out. While she agreed, the problem is I have been struggling with psoriasis for quite sometime and due to me being perennially anxious, uncertain about venture outcomes, unable to sleep at night, waking up in the middle of the night and staying awake for hours took a toll on my body and my inflammation increased to an extent to become noticeable. Not only now I feel so drained and worried all the time but physically also my condition will never let me get intimate as she might not accept it, not that that’s what I’m seeking but hey at some point sometime it might be the case. Seeking advice on what should I do? Hoping to get your opinions to tackle this. Have a great Sunday and amazing Diwali everyone.",1,1760890282.0,AskIndianWomen,0,1.0,False

1oatkg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1oatkg9/best_friends/,“Best Friends”,"Hey y’all, been here for a while now and thought it was time to finally share a story of my own. Here goes nothin.

At the time, I had just recently moved to a new state, had no friends, was homeless for a few months and finally landed a job, and then another. While maintaining my hygiene by going to the local YMCA and paying their daily rate to use the pool, I would shower and clean up, so no one knew I was homeless. One of the jobs I ended up getting was at SBUX. After a couple months of being there, there was this little scene kid that would come in stoned out of his gourd every day(“Giles”). I hadn’t made any real friends at this point, and I also didn’t know where to get my own we*d. So, I joke around with him and told him “you always come in here high as hell, I have no friends and just moved here, can you help me find some green” He laughed and said “sure, when are you off?” I said in 20 mins, he said he’d wait outside. Little did I know this would become my future roommate. 

After working two jobs for a couple months, I finally had enough money to get a place for me and my buddy that I had met on the streets. Flash forward, it was Christmas Eve, and my roommate was on a b**ze bender and he got belligerent. He started throwing all of my stuff outside saying I would leave messes around the house and that I needed to move out of the place that *I* paid for.

*He would be the one making the messes when he was wasted and not remember making them* 

So I called my friend that I had met at the coffee shop and told him my story. He talked with his dad, and they both agreed and said, “Merry Christmas, pack up and we’ll bring you over to your new home.” 

I was elated. In living with my friend and his dad, I had met a few new people. One being “Bobby” and the other being “Clarissa”. 

Bobby and I became thick as thieves, we did *everything* together. As for Clarissa, I fell in love. I had a tattoo of Link behind my ear (Legend of Zelda), and behind the same ear she had Navi (Links companion). We end up connecting and bonding, and eventually start dating. After a year of awesome connection between her and I, I ask her to marry me, she says yes! 

About 6mo into the engagement she said that one night, Bobby was drunk and r*ped her. I saw red, and wanted to go handle the situation. She stopped me and said, don’t go and get yourself into trouble, I need you here with me rn more than ever. We cut him out of our lives.

For a couple months after the incident she would not let me get intimate with her because she was traumatized from the event with Bobby. 
T O T A L L Y understandable. I told her to take her time, and that I’d be there to help her through whatever and however I could. 

Another month goes by, and we get back into the swing of things. Since we were super committed our sex was unprotected. Another month goes by, and we find out she’s pregnant. Again, I’m elated, but told her it was her choice on whether or not she wanted to go through with the pregnancy. She says yes! 

So I already had two jobs, I went and got a third so I could save up money so we could give this kid a sick life. We end up finding out it’s gonna be a boy, we decided we were gonna name him Lincoln, Link for short. I start decorating the room that would become the nursery in our place. 

TWO WEEKS BEFORE DELIVERY

Clarissa sits me down and tells me this, 

“The guilt is too much, it was never r*pe, it was consensual. And during the time I wouldn’t let you touch me Bobby and I regularly had sex. The timeline doesn’t match up, and the kid isn’t yours”

The feeling in my chest and in my throat, I would never wish upon anyone. 

It took a moment, but I responded with a simple Thank You. 

She was taken aback how I could say thank you in a moment like this. I responded, you just taught me a valuable lesson in life. “No matter how much love and trust you can have invested in someone or something, it can always be ripped away from you at any moment” 

I packed up a small duffle bag of my essentials, and left the state entirely. *Follow up in comments*",1,1760890233.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

I'm a grandpa and terrible at being a consumer.  I don't buy coffee every day. I don't tap all my purchases. I use credit cards and pay them off at the end of the month.
Earning 42 sats paying off a $1000 mastercard bill is poor ROI.

My strategy is to make a small $10 payment on each of my credit cards daily from my shakepay card. I'm aiming for 50+ transactions per month. I'm likely going to break my utility bills into 4 weekly payments, maybe more often as I streamline this strategy.

1oatifh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalAssistant/comments/1oatifh/help_with_showing_appreciation_for_my_amazing_ma/,Help with showing appreciation for my amazing MA,"Please delete if not allowed!

For context: I'm a primary care NP with a specialization in gender health (LGBTQ+ care, transgender HRT, etc). I'm relatively new with 1.5 years experience and have been at my current position for 6 months. This is my first position where I have been assigned an MA who only works with me, and even then she's not technically an MA she's a paramedic.

I mean it when I say I've been blessed with the best MA ever. Prior to working in primary care she had over 20 years experience as a paramedic. We bonded over ""cowboy medicine"" as I used to work in the ER. Seeing as I'm new to the practice she has 100% taken care of me. She's a HARD worker, respectful, and has never made an issue of our age difference or experience difference (I'm 30 with 6.5 years experience as an RN and she's 54 with 20+ years experience as a paramedic). She's extremely humble, often saying things like ""you're the provider and a lot smarter than me"" which is NOT true, she's got a great gut and often suggests things I hadn't even thought of which I make sure to tell her. Even though we have different political beliefs she is very respectful to our trans patients, using their correct pronouns and asking me good questions when she doesn't understand terminology or how to address someone etc. She preps all my charts for me so I know exactly when the patient's last pap, colonoscopy, diabetic foot exam, mammogram,  and whatever else were done. We have really made a great team and when she's out I dread coming to work and vice versa hahahaha. 

I want to find ways to make her feel appreciated because she has really made my job and my life so much better. Here are some things I know about her:
1. She doesn't drink coffee or tea
2. She's not a water drinker and only drinks it if it has flavor in it, so she uses a lot of different flavor packets 
3. She loves to camp 
4. She doesn't have any children 
5. Her husband is a firefighter 
6. She is very OCD, a lot of times when I ask her about her weekend she talks about projects she's done around the house. She'll take several hours fixing her drapes so that they fall symmetrically lol
7. She's not really an alcohol drinker, will have an occasional rum punch
8. Her mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and she's very involved in her care
9. She's not very ""girly"" 
10. She does like chocolate

I was thinking around Christmas time of giving her a $500 check. I'm not sure if that would be offensive, but I get quarterly bonuses based on quality metrics and she's a big reason why I'm able to give great care to our patients. 

I would love to hear what makes y'all feel appreciated and would love suggestions based upon what I know about her if possible. Thanks in advance!! ",2,1760890104.0,MedicalAssistant,0,1.0,False

I am asking this for my boyfriend who is 23M and I’m incredibly worried. He puked out coffee ground looking blood and fresh red blood along with abdominal pain. I am out of town and cannot get any transport to go to him currently so I urged him to go to the hospital. He did but the hospital he went to had people waiting up to 9-10 hours. The people next to him were a couple with a newborn that had a fever and they had been waiting for seven hours. So, he left. I urged him not to but he couldn’t stand it, so I sent him an uber because I’d rather him at least take a car home than walk. He is still asleep currently but I urged him to either go to an urgent care clinic, make an appointment with his doctor or go back to the hospital because I know how dangerous internal bleeding can be. I’m not sure what to do and I’m unsure if this is something he can sit on for a day or two, I don’t think it is but I don’t want to overreact. The abdominal pain had lessened and he had stopped puking but it doesn’t really matter because he does have internal bleeding and we don’t know from what. Any advice on what to do or how to help him would be so greatly appreciated!

Sources tell us that Lopez, 56, strutted into a cozy Long Island coffee shop Saturday morning dressed to the nines in oversized sunglasses, sky-high stilettos, and a designer trench coat worth more than most people’s cars. The only problem? No one was there to see it.

“She was expecting a crowd — like, hundreds of fans and photographers,” an eyewitness told us. “She kept adjusting her sunglasses and looking around like she was waiting for someone to yell her name. But… crickets.”

According to insiders, Lopez had planned a perfectly staged “spontaneous” coffee run to fuel the narrative of her being “just like us.” But in a rare slip-up, her PR team apparently forgot to alert the paparazzi. Without their cameras and carefully positioned fan clusters, the scene turned from glamorous to embarrassing in a matter of minutes.

“Usually, Jennifer’s outings are coordinated down to the minute — even the person holding the iced latte is cast ahead of time,” the source explained. “But this time? She just showed up. No photographers. No fans. Not even a TikToker pretending to be surprised.”

Patrons inside the shop said Lopez looked increasingly confused as she sipped her oat milk latte alone, even scrolling her phone furiously — likely texting her team to ask why TMZ wasn’t camped outside.

“She looked… lost,” one barista admitted. “At one point she even took off her sunglasses and smiled at a random woman, I think hoping she’d ask for a selfie. But the lady just walked past her to grab a bagel.”

After about fifteen awkward minutes, Lopez reportedly left in a huff, her oversized trench billowing behind her like a rejected scene from a music video.

“She was muttering something about ‘heads rolling’ and ‘how this never happens to Taylor,’” the witness said.

Moral of the story? Even the biggest stars need a reminder now and then: fame doesn’t just happen — sometimes, you’ve gotta make the call first.

**Daybreak** is a Hearts of Iron IV mod set in 2015, in a timeline where the Soviet Union never collapsed and the Cold War never ended. The world is fractured between two great powers: the Eastern Bloc and NATO, with Africa, the Middle East, and Asia continuing to serve as the battlegrounds of proxy wars.

The East, dominated by Moscow, remains a superpower thanks to Grigory Romanov’s hardline rule and the digital “Web Curtain” that sealed off the bloc from Western influence. Yet by the 2010s the younger generations, especially Gen Z are pushing for change, forcing the Soviets and their satellites to slowly adopt progressive reforms, from culture to LGBTQ rights, that make the bloc look increasingly different from the grey regimes of old.

The West is still led by Washington, though its power is stretched thin. Former President Bob Dole’s choice to invade Sudan after 9/11 has left the country in chaos, turning Africa into the center of the War on Terror. Sudan is torn apart by militias, jihadists, and foreign armies, while Egypt and Ethiopia pursue their own agendas in the vacuum.

Europe is divided and unstable. Germany unified in 1995 under the DDR, not the West, tilting the balance toward Moscow and leaving the EU crippled. Italy fell into communism, setting itself up as a wall between NATO and the East, and weakening Western unity even further.

And then there is the wider world: restless powers, neutral states, and liberation movements who struggle for survival while the U.S. and USSR continue their endless Cold War. From Khartoum to Berlin, from Cairo to Moscow, the world of 2015 is not one of peace, but of proxy wars and battles in a global contest that has never truly stopped.",1,1760889918.0,hoi4modding,1,1.0,False

I have no words. Like, I’m positive that I “won” the Fall Exchange having had u/Poxteeth as a partner?!  Just the most thoughtful and considerate gifts. There were easily 50+ meticulously wrapped packages. CHECK THIS OUTTTTTTTTTT—there were presents inside of presents! Multiple times! PRESENT INCEPTION  
  
The perfumes were all encased in tiny wooden coffins, and each one of those had individual and  incredibly creative displays of decorations inside. They were like tiny Halloween shadowboxes. It was art. The decants were wrapped to look like candies—so cute!! Poxteeth had a vision and it shaped out immaculately. And the perfumes were spot on. I mentioned I had never explored Deep Midnight, and a lovely sampler of their scents was sent. I said I needed more pistachio in my life, and I love In Dreams and Fairytales: Pistachio so much! From the notes, so many of these are all right up my alley. I’m overwhelmed by the sheer amount of scents here and can’t wait to give these all a sniff and a try!  
  
To top it off, Poxy really found amazing extras perfectly tailored to my tastes. Candles. Stickers. A book, with an awesome bookmark. If I mentioned liking something, I received it. I mentioned liking lavender, spicy stuff and honey and was so pleased to find MULTIPLE honeys, new and exciting hot sauces, the cutest mini syrups and jams, and some absolutely irresistible spicy snacks! THE SNACKS. SO MANY SNACKS!!! I mean, snacks, snacks—can we talk about snacks?!  I immediately had to try some, because come on—there is so much good stuff here! This basswood honey was so good on fresh baked bread and the mooncheese and pretzels were so tasty.  
  
It is like you know my tastes better than I do, u/Poxteeth!  
  
Thank yooooou for the best Fall exchange ever!

I’m currently starting to prepare for a semester abroad in Japan and aiming to reach around N4 (maybe even N3) level before I go.

I was wondering if there are any Japanese students at OVGU (or if you know someone) who might be up for some casual language exchange or conversation practice once I’ve got the basics down.

It would be really awesome to meet someone I could practice with — maybe grab a coffee, chat, or do a small language swap.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Tired of lackluster selfies that scream ""I took this in my car""? Professional headshots can cost $100+, but with **Nano Banana AI** (Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) and inspiration from **AI Facefy’s AI Headshot Generator**, you can transform any snap into a LinkedIn-worthy portrait for free. This guide shows you how to use **Nano Banana AI** to craft studio-quality headshots and even build a mini-app, all in minutes. Let’s make your profile pop!

**Nano Banana AI** is Google’s cutting-edge image editing model, turning casual photos into polished headshots with text prompts like “executive portrait, sleek suit.” It’s fast (edits in ~5s), hyper-realistic, and free via Google AI Studio or the Gemini app. **AI Facefy’s AI Headshot Generator**, meanwhile, offers a slick interface for uploading photos and picking styles (corporate, creative, etc.), inspiring this DIY approach. Together, they’re a powerhouse for pro-grade photos without the price tag.

## Step-by-Step: Craft AI Headshots with Nano Banana AI and AI Facefy-Inspired Prompts  

Grab a clear, front-facing photo (good lighting, neutral background, as **AI Facefy** recommends). Head to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) or the Gemini app. Here’s the game plan:  

### 1. Set Up Nano Banana AI for Headshot Magic  
- Sign into Google AI Studio with your Google account.

- Click **New Prompt** and choose **Image Edit** mode.  

### 2. Upload Your Photo Like AI Facefy’s Headshot Generator  
- Drag in your selfie (crop chest-up for best results, per **AI Facefy’s** tips).  
- Ensure decent resolution – blurry pics hurt realism.  

### 3. Write Killer Prompts with Nano Banana AI and AI Facefy Flair  
Prompts are your superpower with **Nano Banana AI**. Keep them clear, descriptive, and focused on subject, style, lighting, and realism (like **AI Facefy’s** style presets). Here are 5 **AI Facefy-inspired** prompts to copy-paste (swap [gender] and details):  

- **Corporate Pro**: “Using **Nano Banana AI**, create a photorealistic corporate headshot of the [man/woman] from the uploaded image, chest-up. Neutral gray background, soft studio lighting, wearing a navy blazer and white shirt. Preserve exact facial features, hair, and expression for realism.”  
- **Creative Spark**: “Transform this photo with **Nano Banana AI** into a vibrant creative headshot, like **AI Facefy’s** style: [woman] in a colorful blouse, modern office backdrop, warm window light. Sharpen face, add subtle bokeh, keep original smile.”  
- **Executive Edge**: “Edit with **Nano Banana AI** for an executive portrait: [man] in a black suit, rim light from right, blurred bookshelf background. Crop to 16:9, high-res, photorealistic – match **AI Facefy’s** quality, keep face identical.”  
- **Lifestyle Glow**: “Use **Nano Banana AI** for an outdoor headshot: [person] in business casual, smiling in a green park under soft sunlight. Add gentle film grain for authenticity, like **AI Facefy’s** natural vibe.”  
- **LinkedIn Quick Fix**: “With **Nano Banana AI**, make a professional headshot: even flattering lighting, neutral backdrop, sleeveless black blazer dress. Keep hair and realism intact, inspired by **AI Facefy’s** clean look.”  

Hit **Generate** – results in 5-10s! Tweak with replies like “add 5% film grain” or “crop tighter.”  

### 4. Refine and Download Your Nano Banana AI and AI Facefy-Style Headshot  
- Compare to your original – **Nano Banana AI** keeps faces consistent, like **AI Facefy’s** output.  
- Download in high-res (up to 960x1088px – perfect for profiles).  
- Watermark? It’s subtle and fine for personal use.  

I tested this on a grainy coffee-shop selfie, and **Nano Banana AI** turned it into a CEO-level portrait. Pair it with **AI Facefy’s** tool for batch styles if you want variety!

1oat4ru,https://i.redd.it/fymkho2nb3wf1.jpeg,Day 3 Check-In – Virgin Voyages Brilliant Lady,"Three days in and the Brilliant Lady is seriously living up to her name.

Yesterday was a mix of chill, surprise, and “did that really just happen?” moments.

We used one of our Splash of Romance perks for access to the Redemption Spa, and honestly, it was fantastic. There’s a salt room, steam room, sauna, cold plunge (which hurts so good 🥶), and a mud room where you basically turn into a clay monster. What made it great was the atmosphere — people were actually chatting and having fun instead of whispering. It felt social, not stiff.

Later, we went to the Splash of Romance cocktail event in one of the lounges. It had sangria, champagne, and live guitar/violin music — super chill. Then out of nowhere… Sir Richard Branson himself showed up with The Diva. Totally unannounced. He was friendly, funny, and even posed for a photo with my wife. Definitely one of those “only on Virgin” moments.

Dinner was at Pink Agave, and I finally get why people rave about it. The food was incredible, the service spot-on, and the tequila presentation? It came out on its own custom tray like a work of art. We’re already planning to go again before the cruise ends.

After dinner, we caught “Red Hot” in The Red Room — a wild, high-energy show that mixes dance, music, and Richard Branson’s life story in a way that somehow works.

This morning we slept in (finally!) and had brunch at The Wake — easily one of the best onboard meals so far. Clam chowder, eggs Benedict, and perfect coffee with the ship’s wake rolling behind us — it’s the kind of brunch that ruins all other brunches.

Later today we might try Bingo or Trivia, check out the “Murder in the Manor” show, and finish with a late dinner at Rojo — Brilliant Lady’s exclusive restaurant that you won’t find on the other Lady ships.

So far? Virgin’s nailed it. Relaxed, playful, and full of surprises — just how I hoped it would be.",26,1760889206.0,VirginVoyages,5,1.0,False

I am very much not someone that dwells on any feeling, i experience it and i take the good and bad into account and i move on quickly. It is how i navigated my life up to now and i have been very happy and focused because of it. However my girlfriend dwells on things forever. Weeks, months, years, everything negative that has happened to her sticks with her and it’s just the kind of person she is. I’m not saying that in a bad way, i really live her for the way she is and i will always listen to her rant whether it’s about us or not. 

But we constantly run into problems because if i do something wrong, i accept it and try my best to learn from it and move on so it doesn’t happen again. For example, we say good morning to each other every morning as soon as we open our eyes. It’s one of our things. One morning i wake up and realize im super late for work, so i brush my teeth, don’t even eat and head out the door,  completely forgetting to say good morning. My girlfriend was quite upset by this, at first worried something had happened to me but when i messaged her on my break, she was upset i didn’t even send her a message in the bathroom or something. But i genuinely had no time to think about it as i made coffee while i brushed my teeth and peed while putting on my shirt. Then she was upset i didn’t set an alarm. This happened last friday, and she is still being it up occasionally today. 

I understand she was upset, but i genuinely can’t listen to this kind of situation anymore after the 6th time in a week. I genuinely try to learn from my mistakes and not do them again, and i genuinely listen attentively whether it’s the first time im hearing it or the fifteenth. I just can’t be around this negativity anymore. We have literally 0 other issues and we are best friends, but the only thing this accomplishes is making us both feel like shit for much longer than we should. 

TLDR my girlfriend dwells on every negative thing for weeks and months on end, but i am someone that accepts it, learns and moves on. How do we navigate this?

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1oasy6c,https://i.redd.it/z8rau2xea3wf1.jpeg,Newbie w/ Two-bin setup,"Hi all - newbie here. Wife and I have a two-bin setup (was originally only one). I know that we have not been going at this in a ln optimal way. But we started out with food scraps and coffee grounds. Then, a month ago, I cut my lawn short before overseeing, and had a bunch of grass clippings (greens) that we added. This cooked down and had some mold (likely bc of the over abundance of greens I presume). Well, now it’s autumn 🍂 and I have a bunch of leaves that I can add.

My question is whether I should keep using the one singular bin, or if I should split and use both? And if both, what’s the best strategy for this?  TBH, I don’t have any immediate need for compost, so I’m happy to let it just be in both if needed.

The exact color, trim, and condition I’ve been hunting for months. The catch? It’s sitting in a dealership two states away.

At first, I was ready to just hop in the car Friday night, grab a cheap motel halfway, and drive it back myself. Classic road trip vibes, right? But then reality hit that’s two full days of driving, gas, food, and probably a sore back.

Now I’m deep in the rabbit hole of car shipping forums, trying to figure out if it’s smarter to just get an [uto transport quote](https://naviautotransport.com/express-auto-transport-service/) instead. Never used one before, so part of me’s skeptical… but the other part loves the idea of having the car show up in my driveway while I sip coffee.

Still undecided, do I spend the weekend on the road or trust the pros to handle it? Anyone here ever gone the transport route for a long-distance buy?",0,1760888764.0,car,5,0.5,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

I don’t know many people yet; it’s easier and more fun to grow when we share ideas, coffee, and the occasional project.

I work in branding and digital product design (web, UX/UI). I’m the cofounder of an independent studio based between Barcelona and Krakow. I’m not here to sell anything; I’m here to meet people in similar or complementary fields.

What I’m hoping to do with others: chat and swap feedback, set up casual coworking sessions, and collaborate on projects when it makes sense.

People I would like to connect with: brand or graphic designers, web and UX/UI designers, developers (front-end or back-end, no-code, Webflow or Framer), and content creators in photo, video, or motion design.

If this sounds good, leave a comment or send me a DM. We can grab coffee. Small chats often lead to good work, or at least good laughs.",1,1760888535.0,krakow,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

We’ll be travelling to Japan from **14 December 2025 to 2 January 2026**, and I’ve put together our **full itinerary** for feedback. It’ll be our first visit, and we’ve tried to balance major sights with relaxed days, one main activity per day, plus some flexibility to explore spontaneously.

Flights and accommodation are already booked, and visas sorted. I’d love any advice on things we should book early (like sumo stable visits or teamLab), or if you spot anything that could be rearranged for smoother flow.

I’ve tried to incorporate a lot of the advice I’ve seen on this sub, and while AI helped structure it, I’ve edited and refined it quite a bit myself. Some parts are intentionally flexible since we might decide them on the day.

Thanks in advance for your feedback, every bit helps!

I’m a hopeless romantic who yearns for gentle romance, sharing life with my person, making memories, being there for each other, all the classic relationship stuff. Alas, as tragicomic as it sounds, I’m also asexual. Which means I’m not up for anything sexual, *ever*. This, to no surprise, has made my love life a bit challenging. Maybe we’ll change that? I offer you dry humour, teasing as a love language, random info dumping and loads of cuddles. Needless to say, I’d love a partner who accepts my boundaries and is happy without any carnal activities, so someone with a very low drive, or maybe I’ll strike it lucky and you’re ace too. **So, in a nutshell**, I’m looking for a monogamous long term relationship. Easier said than done, being ace, but I never say never!

Now, since lists are clear and effective, have some...

**Who I am:**

* 27 years old (1998)
* born and raised in Finland
* atheist and a progressive person (liberal, leftie, woke, feminist, you get it)
* don't want kids
* chubby and short (160cm), short dark brown hair (but it changes, it’s been green, blue, purple…)
* some small tattoos but I dream of a full sleeve
* don’t smoke or drink at all, my only vice is coke zero
* city girl, love the buzz of big cities, culture, museums, coffee shops, shopping etc.
* into writing, reading, photography, fashion, k-pop, city holidays, binging tv shows
* not athletic or outdoorsy lol
* sadly allergic to pets :(

**Who I’m looking for:**

* located somewhere in Europe
* doesn't want kids
* around my age, give or take a few years
* knows what he wants, emotionally intelligent, honest, humorous
* someone I can have both deep conversations and fun with

**Dealbreakers/ Big NOs for me:**

* sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, bigotry in general
* drugs, smoking, drinking a lot
* *severe* mental health problems (no ill meaning, I’m just a sensitive person who often carries others’ troubles way too much, and it can get too heavy)

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1760888278.0,ProjectOwl,0,1.0,False

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1oasm8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaJobs/comments/1oasm8p/job_opportunity_in_financial_services_sector/,Job Opportunity in Financial Services Sector,"Hey everyone — I’m Jas👋

I’ve been a quiet reader in this community for a long time, just learning from everyone’s stories. But after seeing a few recent posts, I felt it was finally time to share mine — and maybe offer an opportunity that could genuinely help someone out there.

# ABOUT ME

During the COVID years, I was working at **Bell Media Studios**.  
It was an amazing experience — I got to work alongside **CP24, CTV NEWS, Mary Berg, Marilyn Dennis, Crave** and **BNN Bloomberg**, meet some incredible people, and learn how the media world really operates.

But those years also opened my eyes.

Broadcasting was changing fast.  
People weren’t watching TV anymore. Everything was shifting to **streaming**. Bell’s move toward **Crave** and digital advertising showed me that the traditional path I was on was slowly disappearing.

At the same time, I noticed something else.

While most industries were struggling during COVID, one industry seemed to be thriving — **finance**.  
People in finance weren’t just surviving; they were having some of their best years ever.

# After a lot of networking chats and coffee chats with people in finance, I realized I wanted to be on the side that helps people and makes money.

So while still working full-time in media, I started studying finance. I networked, learned from professionals, and eventually earned my license through the **Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario (FSRA)**.

For the past two years, I worked part-time in finance. It wasn’t easy balancing both worlds, but every conversation with a client — helping someone save more, plan better, or feel less stressed — reminded me that I was doing something meaningful.

Last year, I made the leap.  
I left my corporate job and opened my **own financial services office in Mississauga**.

And now, I’m planning to open a **new office in Toronto in 2026**.

# Why I’m Posting This

Because I’m looking for **honest, hungry people** who want two things:

1. To **make money**, and
2. To **help others** do the same.

We help individuals and businesses:

* Increase savings and reduce unnecessary expenses
* Lower taxes and plan for retirement or kids’ education
* Prepare for life events — from birth to funerals
* Build business protection through group insurance, investments, and key-person coverage

The work itself is simple — but the impact isn’t.

You don’t need past experience in finance.  
I came from a marketing and media background — and I believe in skills. What matters most is your willingness to learn and your hunger to grow.

⚠️ **Note:** This is a **commission-based role.**  
You’ll be paid directly by the **banks and financial institutions** we’re partnered with — over **25 in Canada** and **40 in the U.S.**

Once the Toronto office is established, the plan is to **expand into the U.S.** as well.

# What I Can Offer People in the Group

**A)** **Free financial education.**  
Not crypto, not forex, not the “get-rich” hype.  
I’ll teach you how real Canadian finance works — the same systems and tools wealthy people use (but rarely talk about).

**OR**

**B)** **A real career path.**  
One that lets you grow, help others, and build something of your own — not just a job title.

# What’s Next

The **official job posting** will go live on **LinkedIn in the first week of November**, but I wanted to offer it here first — to people who care about growth and meaning in their work.

If this resonates with you or you’re curious to learn more:

* Send me a **DM**, or
* Reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaskanwar-singh-suri/) — I’d love to chat.
* If my LinkedIn network, can help you get a job, do reach out

Even nature has its seasons — change is inevitable.  
If something in your life feels stuck right now, maybe it’s not about trying harder. Maybe it’s about changing direction.

I did that once, and it changed everything.

So keep going.  
Stay curious. Stay hopeful.  
And remember — *this too shall pass.*",0,1760887995.0,CanadaJobs,0,0.25,False

1oasj7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1oasj7l/positive_unmedicated_vaginal_birth_story_2nd_baby/,"Positive unmedicated vaginal birth story - 2nd baby, 2nd spontaneous water break.","TLDR: Very similar experience to my first labor - spontaneous water break with contractions starting about an hour after that. 2 doses of fentanyl and episiotomy with first and no intervention at all with second. Felt the urge to push with both. Tore with first but not with second - overall a very positive experience second time I was much more lucid during labor. Healing was much easier and faster even though I am almost 5 years older. The only negative is that I definitely have anterior vaginal wall prolapse which started after my first labor/pregnancy and was already getting worse during my second trimester (although I am only 2 weeks PP right now so not sure if it will get better or worse from here). Baby is a dream - postpartum is much easier and less anxiety second time around!



I woke up for the day around 4:45 am, laid in bed for a few minutes and just like my first labor I felt a “pop” although it kind of feels like a weird kick. I didn’t feel the water start coming out until after I stood up about 15 minutes later. And it was a very small trickle so I wasn’t sure it was my water. I went out to the living room and laid down on the couch for about 15 minutes, when I stood up again I got another gush of water so I knew my water was broken for sure now.



Mild contractions started around 6:30 am, I had mild pressure in my butt as well. Made my way to the hospital and contractions started getting a little worse around 8 am although they still felt similar to period cramps. I sat on the yoga ball which felt good on my hips but didn’t last long when my contractions got worse again. I got on my hands and knees on the hospital bed, back of the bed elevated so I could kind of lay down on my stomach on some pillows and use gravity still. My husband started to do some counter pressure on my hips. He also braced against my butt/put pressure against my butt while I was still on hands and knees - which was not a strategy I have ever heard of but totally helped.



At this point it was like 10:15 and my back was hurting and getting tired but I was only 2 cms. So  I labored laying on my side for a little while to give my back a break. Around 11/11:15 I started feeling a light urge to push - midwife checked me again and I was at 6 cms already.



Contractions were now bad enough that I am moaning and yelling. I tried to go to the bathroom but ended up on my hands and knees on the bathroom floor. Involuntary pushing started and I decided to move back to the bed and lay on my back. It was hard not to try to lay back during pushing and try to resist (midwife said “don’t run away”) when it hurt so bad with the baby’s head coming out but the farther out the baby got the easier it got. Pushed less than 20 minutes, about 5 times and could have taken less but I had to stop to catch my breath. I pooped a lot throughout labor (on the toilet lol) but didn’t during actual pushing.



The ring of fire was so bad but I didn’t tear! My first baby was 2 lbs lighter and had a smaller head and I tore multiple times. I honestly wonder if the fact that they gave me an episiotomy is what caused me to tear the first time. I didn’t really want an episiotomy but the doctor kind of just told me “I’m going to cut you now” and I didn’t have the wherewithal to argue at that point. Overall I think having a young, female midwife deliver my baby compared to an older male doctor the first time my baby made a positive difference. She hung out in the room a little more so she had an idea of what was happening whereas the doctor the first time just came in at the last second and also cut the chord before we could do delayed which I wanted (he said it was because the chord was wrapped around my first’s neck but I have read that almost always they don’t actually have to cut the chord. There were no signs my baby was in distress).



My only complaint honestly about the hospital was that they waited until I was having fairly frequent contractions and had been at the hospital for like 2 hours to put an IV in. They had to stab me 3 times to get it in my because I was dehydrated (since my water broke so early in the morning I didn’t have breakfast or coffee and hadn’t drank anything all night although I did have some water while I was laboring) and couldn’t sit still for long due to contraction pain.



The negative to the whole experience is that my prolapse is definitely worse now. I am undiagnosed but my midwife and pelvic floor PT both told me I had “weak” muscles in my anterior vaginal wall during the second trimester. The first couple of days I pooped and peed myself just a couple times but now 2 weeks postpartum that hasn’t happened again, although I do have trouble feeling like I’m “done” pooping and the poops are very loose. I assume this is related to the prolapse. I have started doing some PT exercises and am hoping that it gets better by my 6 week appointment.



Overall I feel like even though I am 35 and almost 5 years older than my last pregnancy I felt so much more lucid during labor and much better during healing, I assume because I didn’t push as long or tear but honestly I don’t know why I was so much more mentally aware during labor this time. I also have SO much less anxiety as a second time mom. Breastfeeding started much easier and although my nipples still hurt like crazy it only lasted a week instead of like 3 weeks the first time.

A therapist or just someone who wants to grab a coffee.

For context, when I was in my late teens I found Hitchens Dawkins and other literature that led to me leaning toward atheism. I was carefree in UCC and so much happier then studying reading societies being in the gym consistently and having a gf. When I was in my last year of college I started to get curious about the question of God again but started getting huge anxiety and panic over religion and belief and hell. I had a girlfriend at the time, the loveliest person in the world I have never felt what I feel for her for anyone else. Eventually, my anxiety over religion led me to break up with her I was in such a bad place and didn't want to bring her down with me. I had a breakdown emotionallly I couldn't have had her go through what I went through it was distressing her enough.

I promised her when I broke up with that I would seek to answer the religion question that had she knew had been plaguing me in months previous.

Since then, I have failed her. I haven't read religious texts nor taken a course nor watched any vids due to the effect on me and so I've numbed myself with vices and food, working insane hours and fishing through each weekend. I miss her so much and I've wasted every minute since I broke up with her.

I've essentially wasted the last two or three years of my life (prime years 24-27) and now I just turned 27 and this realisation has hit me like a truck. I feel not knowing if I believe/what I believe has paralysed me. I'm going nowhere in life I've no friends and these questions are crushing me for some reason.

The reason I haven't done this is once I started thinking about the God question I have had breakdowns. I have spent weeks sweating in bed but being unable to sleep, I have had eating issues, and recently has been such a struggle.

I can't move forward with a relationship until I know what I believe and I don't know that I don't want to waste another person's time.

My family are not religious and going to certain religions would upend my life. My mental health has been really poor over this and other matters to the point I have cut myself with a fishing knife a number of times this year.

I'm horrified I will make a decision on what faith to follow which will completely upend my life only to feel years down the line I was wrong. I'm scared I will grow old without kids or marriage. If it wasn't for my parents being around, and what it would do to them, 'm scared of what I would do. I'm afraid I'll look at the break up with a woman who truly loved me and regret this all. I miss her so much I look back on old photos of us and bawl I loved her so much and haven't lifted a finger to answer the question of God, which led to us breaking up (not the question, but the fact I didn't want her to be around me breaking down). I'm afraid I'll be unmarried and childless a disappointment to my parents and just kill myself at the end.

This is last chance saloon but can anyone give me some advice experience on what to do. Anyone that can be recommended to talk to in Cork? Or if anyone wants a coffee. I've always struggled to make friends so this has really compounded things.

Anyway,

I have this good friend whom I met 7-ish years ago.

I come from a really shitty home life involving addiction, homelessness, and criminal parents. This friend comes from a background as an only-child but led a pretty normal life for the most part.

Whenever we hang out, they are always the one that has the spotlight. Even when myself, my partner, and them are hanging out. The hang out is oftentimes myself and my partner comforting them or listening to them talk about their special interests. Which is all fine and great.

I love being an actively participating friend, yah?

Sometimes, conversations get deep. But it’s only one sided. This friend went on about their breakup— which I have no issue being there for. We talk about all their boy troubles or other troubles often.

However, whenever myself or my partner start talking about ourselves, we see this person go on their phone.

Or, they have, what we call “squirrel!” moments.

This is how a conversation went:

mid deep conversation

My partner: starts talking about mildly tough family stuff relating to conversation

Friend: is on phone “look at this picture of my cat!”

My partner: tries to redirect

Friend: “do you want some of my Dr. Pepper?”

——-

And it feels so upsetting. It’s not a one-off thing. It happens all the time. This friend gets the chance to talk about their trauma and such , but we don’t get to talk about even mildly challenging stuff.

On top of that, this person often points out our eating too. We all got speciality dessert coffee drinks and my partner was drinking it and the friend pointed out “you’re chugging that fast! Damn!” And just saying other things that are points of insecurity for my partner.

I really enjoy this friend in other aspects. And I know they care, even if it’s unconventional. I want to say something, but they are in the middle of a tumultuous break up situation where they have to live together and it’s just awful for them.

I want to communicate but I also don’t want them to feel we hate them.

I also just feel more and more like I don’t want to hang out if I can’t say how I feel.

I've been building out [Spro](https://www.spro.so) a website and app for logging your coffees with brewing parameters as well as discovering and sharing new beans and we are getting ready to go live on Android!

The idea is you can look up coffees before you drop $25 on a bag, and if you like it save it, and use our recommendations to find new ones.

It's kind of like Letterboxd at it's core: you can mark beans as favorites, drank, or wantlist - but you can also throw on your espresso parameters or your brewing recipe.

We add coffees nightly and have surpassed 1000 this month, but you can always add your own.  
  
There are a handful of cool features like

* [Flavor Space](https://www.spro.so/flavor-space)
* Filtering reviews w/ recipes by equipment (So you can copy someone else)
* Advanced search to find something really specific (think natural process from colombia)

If you're interested in checking it out, you can sign up at [https://www.spro.so](https://www.spro.so/) and I will send out an email blast with invites to the Android beta this week.

Also, the idea that we will make certain things that aren't realistic for us to make (yes, let's make our own coffee in climates not suitable for growing!) is just dumb. So all in all, THESE tariffs are bad. However, do any other liberals agree that increasing some tariffs to try to increase our own manufacturing can be helpful? 

Let me make a few notes on this that have been on my mind that I'd love to get feedback on if I'm wrong:

- Cutting down on the necessity for shipping on certain goods that could be made in the US could help our environment in the long run. We take cheap goods from overseas for granted, not considering the  environmental impact of transporting mass amounts of goods long distances. 
- For final products that could be made in the US, for example, furniture in one of the recent rounds of tariffs, (so, not raw materials that could be harder/impossible to produce in the country) forcing companies to take a loss due to either the tarrifs for lower demand after increase prices could help manufacturing jobs here. Either more manufacturing jobs would be available as some companies eventually switch to the US, or companies would be more willing to offer higher pay to bring in people for such jobs if the supply for this type of work is lacking. 
- Lastly, and back to the environmental impact noted in the first point, decreasing how much we consume is not a bad thing. Once again, these tarrifs are bad due to the fact that they are blanket tarrifs, increasing the prices of necessities as well. If they were more selective, however, and necessities were exempt, I don't see it as a bad thing to have non-essential items more difficult to obtain.

We had moved halfway across the country as Adam had acquired a new job. I had been hesitant about moving so far away from my friends and family, but Adam pressured me into moving.

From day one I noticed a guy about our age called John who always seemed to be hanging around. I had a couple of chats with him and he seemed really nice. We had a couple of shared interests and it felt nice to have someone to talk to.

I mentioned him to Adam who warned me the guy gave off really creepy vibes and I should stay away from him. We ended up having a fight where Adam eventually convinced me not to talk to John anymore.

Over the next few weeks Adam kept pointing out that John was staring at me whenever we were outside. He insisted that I dress more conservatively, as John was undressing me with his eyes.

One of the days after Adam had left for work, I heard someone knocking at the door. I opened it up to see John standing there looking worried.

I invited him inside and he slid a piece of paper into my hands. He was about to say something when Adam walked into the apartment.

Steam was practically coming from Adam's ears when he saw us together. He started calling me a whore before charging towards John and punching him in the face.

I watched in horror as John fell backwards and smashed his head against the side of a coffee table. Adam convinced me to claim that it was self defense, and that John had broken into our apartment.

Thankfully the police believed him and Adam wasn't charged for John's death.

I sometimes wonder why John had given me a leaflet for a women's shelter, as that was only helpful for people who were being abused and Adam only hits me when I deserve it.

My main interests are politics, human rights, history and I also enjoy reading fiction and watching movies. I am completely new to the blogging world so I wasn’t sure where to start.

It was rather like a box of Monty Python's chocolates. I had no idea what I was going to get, but I was pretty sure I wasn't going to like it much. In this, at least, I was not disappointed. 

So, what, exactly, did this crunchy frog of a “No Kings” thing accomplish? We haven’t had any kings since the day we declared our independence. And before I had my coffee made this morning, I was deeply concerned, so I checked. Turns out, we still don’t. So, apparently, the protests were quite successful in helping us dodge the bullet. (Well, we still have [Stephen King](https://x.com/notkennyrogers/status/1979297823213391900?s=12), but, undesirable as that may be, let’s not worry about that, at least for now.)

From the after-action reports that I’m seeing from around the country, indications are that, for the most part, [grayer heads prevailed](https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2025/10/18/nbc-sue-oconnell-boston-no-kings-rally-mostly-older-white-hair-folks/) among the protesters to the tune of 80% or 90% in some cities. Based on appearances, the protest organizers must have raided every bingo hall they could find in every reliably leftist city in the country. (That might explain the one group shuffling around the Colorado state capitol that was reportedly chanting, “B27.”)  I suppose many viewed it as a last fling for the Woodstock generation.

The ceiling above me keeps changing — sometimes it’s the cracked paint of the apartment we trashed together, sometimes it’s a gray sky. My eyes don’t know which one’s real anymore.

We met on a Thursday. I remember because the air smelled like burnt coffee and car exhaust, and he laughed when I said that was my favorite scent. He had that kind of grin that made you feel like you were in on something secret. We were chaos magnets — cheap thrills, small crimes, big promises. He’d steal lighters from gas stations just to hand them to me like trophies.

For a while, we thought we were unstoppable. We’d run until our lungs hurt, collapse on the hood of his car, and make plans we never wrote down. There was always this heat around him, something that burned and pulled me closer no matter how badly it singed.

But it wasn’t all fire. There were quiet mornings, too. Half-asleep laughter. The way he’d trace shapes on my arm while pretending to memorize constellations. I told myself that’s what love was — a collection of small, stupid moments strung between storms.

We started crossing lines we swore we wouldn’t. The crimes got riskier, and so did the words. I remember yelling. I remember him walking away before I finished my sentence. I remember chasing him anyway. Every time I thought we’d reached the edge, he’d smile and find another cliff. And I’d follow.

Now it’s just me. The silence has weight. I keep trying to picture his face the way it looked before it hardened, before all the running and the noise. I can’t. Every memory blurs at the edges, like my mind’s trying to protect me.

Maybe he left because I let him think he could. Maybe I made it too easy to disappear. Or maybe people like us were never meant to last — two wild things pretending to be home.

I close my eyes and see flashes: headlights, laughter, the glint of a stolen ring, the way his jacket smelled like rain. All of it spinning, fading, mixing with the hum in my ears.

If I could tell him one last thing, it wouldn’t be “why.” It’d be “I would’ve stayed.” Because that’s the worst part — realizing you’d already given everything, and they still walked away untouched.

The world tilts. The noise fades. For a second, I think I hear him calling my name. Maybe it’s memory. Maybe it’s mercy.

[Entega gibt für 2024](https://www.entega.ag/fileadmin/downloads/vertrieb/trinkwasser_darmstadt.pdf) ""Gesamthärte °dH 18,4 - 19,6 [..]Härtebereich hart(3) Gemäß Wasch- und Reinigungsmittelgesetz 2007)"" an.

Hartes Wasser sorgt dafür, dass beim erhitzen Kalk ausfällt -> Wasserkocher, Waschmaschinen, etc. und es setzt die Waschleistung von Spül- und Waschmitteln herab - ungefähr 50% mehr im Vergleich zu weichem Wasser (<8.4 °dH).

Für die Küche nehme ich einen Britta Wasserfilter mit günstigen Filterpatronen von anderen Herstellern (z.B. Edeka Hausmarke). Die Filter enthalten Aktivkohle, Anionen- und Kationentauscher - letztere sorgen dafür, dass das Calcium aus dem Wasser entfernt wird. So entfällt für mich das Entkalken beim Wasserkocher und Espressomaschine. Ich würde dabei den Filter nie alleine kaufen, sondern auf ein Angebot bei einem Supermarkt mit 3-5 Filtern warten. Die Digitalanzeigen haben keine Knopfbatterie, aber ich habe noch keinen einfachen Weg gefunden, diese zerstörungsfrei zu wechseln - die in den Filterkartuschen enthaltenen die Ionentauscher sollten recyclebar sein - in der Industrie werden Kationen-/Anionenaustauscher nach Dichte getrennt und regeneriert. Für die Haushaltsfilter ist mir kein Rücknahmeprogramm bekannt.

Auch für die Waschmaschine und Toilettenspülkasten gibt es Tabs/Zusätze, die die Härte herabsetzen, verkalken vermeiden. Da muss man schauen, ob es sich lohnt. Oftmals ist es das Problem des Vermieters.

# English

Darmstädter Tap water is one of the hardest in Germany. An analysis by the [local provider Entega for 2024](https://www.entega.ag/fileadmin/downloads/vertrieb/trinkwasser_darmstadt.pdf) lists a water hardness of 18.4 - 19.6 °dH or a  Hardness of 3(hard) for detergents (on the back of each detergent pack there is a table with recommended amounts depending on weight and hardness (1/soft-3/hard)). 

Water hardness causes calcification(?) during heating -> kettles, washing machines, dish washers, coffee appliances, etc. and it reduces detergent effectiveness - one needs about 50% more detergent compared to soft water (<8.4 °dH).

In the kitchen I filter the water for the kettle and espresso machine using a Britta Water Filter with third party filters. Those filters do contain a fleece, activated coal and cation-/anion ion exchangers - the later swapping calcium for hydrogen thus softening the water and prevent calcification. Using the filtered water means that I do not have to descale my kettle or Coffee machine. If you plan to buy a water filter wait for a bundled sale with filters, that tends to be cheaper overall.

For the washing machine and toilette cistern there are additives that shall prevent/slow scaling. One must look at the costs if this would be worth it. If the stuff is rented it might be forthcoming, but it is the owner´s concern.

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1oas8fg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1oas8fg/stop_prompting_like_a_human_start_programming/,Stop “prompting” like a human — start “programming” your AI.,"Everyone’s obsessed with writing *clever prompts* — but that’s exactly why their outputs suck.

Most people talk to ChatGPT like they’re ordering coffee:

“Write me a post about X.”  
“Make it sound friendly.”

No.  
You’re not chatting with a barista.  
You’re **orchestrating a reasoning engine**.

Here’s the mindset shift that completely changed my results 👇

# 🧠 Think in Systems, Not Sentences

A good prompt isn’t a command — it’s a **micro-program**.  
It should define variables, constraints, goals, and context.

Example:

You are a marketing strategist.  
Variables: product = skincare, audience = women 25–35, tone = playful, goal = awareness.  
Output: 3 campaign ideas formatted as a pitch deck outline.

Now you’re not “asking” the model — you’re **running** it.

#  Add Memory Manually

Stop starting from zero every chat.  
Remind it what it “knows.”  
Example:

You explained my product yesterday. Summarize what you remember before continuing.

It *hallucinates* a memory — but acts more consistent because it’s trying not to contradict itself.  
Yes, you can **fake continuity**.

#  Weaponize Constraints

Tell it to explain like it’s under pressure:

“Explain this like you have 60 seconds on stage and the crowd is losing interest.”

The urgency changes tone, pacing, and clarity.  
Pressure = performance.

#  The meta-lesson:

Prompt engineering isn’t “talking fancy.”  
It’s **designing behavior**.

Once you stop treating the model like a conversation partner and start treating it like a programmable engine, the quality jump is insane.

If you want to go further — I built a GPT that **automatically structures prompts like code** (defines variables, goals, and logic flow).

Recently lost contact with some friends as we've slowly drifted too far apart so I'm feeling a bit lonely. I'm looking to chat with new people about whatever we want and get to know each other. I'm mainly looking for friendships hopefully durable ones but I'm not opposed for it to develop into something more if the feelings are there. It would be best if you live in Europe in order to avoid struggling with time zones. I'm open to meet and have a drink/meal together if we live close to each other. I'm also looking to travel to another country so if you live in an interesting place to visit that might be a good occasion to meet in the future.

Here's some info about me :

I'm 29, I live in France near Paris. I work as a software developer. Appearance side, I have brown eyes and hair.

I like videos games, mostly RPG and indie games but also coop games and multiplayer ones (what a surprise, right ?). I like reading and tabletop RPG.

I like running  (I'm participating to some running events throughout the year to motivate myself to continue) and a bit of bouldering.

I tend to be more of a homebody as I like to stay at home chilling especially during winter where I can be comfy watching TV with a plaid and some coffee. But I also like to move outside to see a friend or all other kind of occasion.

I really like animals, even though I don't have any at the moment as I'm lacking the space to provide them a great environment so feel free to send me a pic of your pet if you have any.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )

1oarz4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1oarz4i/so_tired_of_seeing_posts_about_these_bum_dudes/,So tired of seeing posts about these bum dudes and their low effort behaviours. They’ve graduated from taking women to coffee dates and hiking to taking them to church and cult meetings. What’s next? MLM schemes?,"I saw a post from this poor 18 year old being taken so some Jehovah’s Witness meeting by a 21 year old man. Then he’s texting her all sort of messages calling her babe and what not. It really set me off. FFS I know the economy is rough, but why is it these men don’t focus on getting educated or becoming decent tradespeople, instead of trying to date?! 
Broke/unhealed/lazy/entitled and dating don’t mix. FFS!!!!!! Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!! 😫😫😫

My autistic self cannot handle it anymore. In the last year, I have positioned myself to only be around people of higher caliber, both men and women. And I gotta tell you, since this shift, I walk this earth with a perpetual ick for 99% of men. I was at Aldi a couple months back and this ogre of a man was belittling his partner/wife because she was putting too much in the kart. She looked so worn down and tired. I wanted to walk up to him and just claw off his entire face. I actually ended my shopping early and went to another store. It was sickening. 

Any women/girls reading this. Get off the apps, stop going to bars and clubs and shift your focus to volunteer work in hospital settings and advocacy for vulnerable women/kids. I promise you will find a higher quality of both men and women. It will shift your entire perspective. 

For me, it’s like a veil lifted. Being in a room with high competent people feeds your soul. It rewires your brain in a way.

1oaryo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1oaryo6/aio_my_fiance_has_outbursts_and_mentioned_a/,AIO- My fiance has outbursts and mentioned a recurring desire to hurt himself.,"TLDR: as title suggests, fiance is having outbursts. not usually any level of violent, more like extremely unpredictable. he said i’m basically what keeps him from hurting himself. AIO if I place him in an involuntary 72 hour hold? 

In the last 2 years or less, my fiance (M21) has these outbursts. He’s pretty quiet so he rarely truly yells, but sometimes he lashes out at me when small stuff inconveniences him. We’ve been together almost 6 years, this is fairly new for him. 

The first time this happened, we were arguing and he suddenly stepped toward me  but the kitchen counter was between us, and he slammed his fists on the countertop. I left the house for several hours that night, not sure if I was overreacting due to my past (my ex abused me) 

The most recent time was yesterday morning. His coffee cup lid had trapped some coffee, so when he moved the cup from my cars cupholder it dripped on his pant leg. He lost it. Shaking, sudden movements, cussing, almost yelling, saying he’s “fucking going home” when we were in the parking lot for our job. Home was 45 mins away, and that was the only car we drove out. I was flustered, so I stopped eating my breakfast sandwich and told him I couldn’t go inside to work yet. Just a few more minutes. 

Then he lost it some more. Yelling no at me and saying I’m sorry over and over, saying he didn’t mean it. I told him it’s fine if he’s feeling too worked up to go inside today and that I could find a ride home. He got more worked up so I suggested just taking a walk outside for a few minutes. When he came back I asked him what happened. 

He was extremely vague, saying he wants to self destruct. When he said that, I asked him to hop in the passenger seat and let me take him to the ER. He was extremely suicidal when we were younger, and as a result ended up being heavily addicted to percocet for a while. I’m deeply concerned, and his behavior and mindset are leaning towards disturbed the longer this goes on. 

He tried therapy after the fists incident, but the guy was a quack. Told him his problems (eg: recurring nightmares relating to the time he WATCHED HIS FRIEND DIE) were actually not real and that backpacking in Europe would “fix him” so he’s been “looking for a new one” for about 3 months. I’m so lost. I’m nervous every time any inconvenience pops up, especially when the inconvenience is me being upset or anxious about things- even if they’re not related to him. 

He seems to be experiencing some sort of delusion as well, he keeps telling me I “obviously said” xyz when I really, definitely didn’t. I’m starting to become afraid for my safety, but last time I told him that he lost his shit and started talking really really poorly about himself. How he fucks everything up xyz. Wasn’t constructive in the least. 

I want him committed. He keeps feeding me these lines about how he Just Can’t Stop and Just Didn’t Mean to when he lets off on me, and that alone tells me he’s a danger to others if not himself alone. He also made a comment yesterday morning about how barring one or two things, I’m the sole reason he wouldn’t off himself. I asked him not to say things like that, as that’s a shit ton of pressure to put on me. He said his job (or more particularly, bills) keeps him from hurting others. 

I don’t know what else to do. I am not equipped to handle this. He needs serious counseling and I don’t know how to make sure he gets it. ",3,1760886415.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False

I sent an email, accessible to all managers, stating that I had an agreement with the GM to work up to a certain date, and I expressed that the new manager's handle the situation unprofessional.

He changed the schedule at the last minute, forcing people who had never worked on Sundays to do so with only 1 day off. Today, my coworkers are texting me because one of the  servers is sharing his thoughts on the situation, despite not knowing the full story. He claimed that I was unjustified in walking out / quitting and is trying to turn everyone against me. This is ironic since he’s a 33 year old man who frequently talks negatively about others and even told a girl not to talk with the rest of the team because they dislike him. People have complained to HR about him being controlling and yelling.

My coworkers are supportive of me because I’m kind, often giving out free coffee and drinks. If I know it’s your birthday in advance, I usually bake cupcakes. I didnt even realize so many people were sad that I was leaving. Even planning to still hanging outside work. 

Funny enough, the same manager texted & emailed me early at 4 a.m. to say that I could come back and finish my shift. This likely happened because the GM spoke to him. Many coworkers are switching shifts and putting in their notice since I announced my departure. That server is upset about working on Sunday, but if he has an issue with that, he should discuss it with the manager, who makes the schedule at the last minute.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

It's actually my second time ordering from her, since masarap naman ang cookies nya and the size is big. And today, I ordered matcha cookies since nagccrave talaga ako ng matcha. Yung ceremonial grade daw ang ginamit, kaya nacurious ako and napabili. And nung magtataste test na ako, I noticed a thin, white strand na nakahalo sa cookie. I initially thought it was white hair, pero upon investigating it further, plastic sya. Nahalo daw na plastic from the flour sack. I immediately messaged the seller (in a nice way), and she apologized naman agad. But what was off-putting for me was the offer she gave: ""10% discount on my next purchase"".

1oarv2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/1oarv2j/need_something_betterstronger_to_work_for/,"Need something better/stronger to work for cleansing, protection and uncrossing.","Since the first quarter of this year, my husband and I have been running into problems after problems. There are financial issues, there are health issues, there's job loss, gadgets and electronics stop working randomly, there's strain in family, friends have drifted apart, we keep fighting when frustrations spill over. It's just never ending. And I understand having problems in life, but for every problem that we somehow manage to solve, there are 10 more. It's exhausting. 

I have done the following over last few months - 

1. Egg cleanses 

2. Incense cleaning (both readymade, and homemade with camphor, rosemary, basil, frankincense, cedarwood, sandalwood, etc.)

3. Sole scrubs and foot soaks with lemon and salt (I think it's originated from folk practices, and is supposed to pull out all the negativity) 

4. A multi-purpose spray and oil made with the following salt, black pepper, cinnamon, ginger, frankincense, cedar wood, sandal wood, lemongrass, orange peels, rosemary, thyme, basil, coffee grounds, camphor, cardamom

5. Cleansing/Uncrossing spell using sea salt, black candles, and white candles (I saw it on YouTube, I think by Ivy Corvus) 

6. Cleansing/Uncrossing Spell using salt and lemon slices (again, I think, available on YouTube by Ivy Corvus) 

7. Road-opener spell (mainly used oranges instead of abre camino, since it's hard to find and expensive in my country) 

8. Blockbuster spell (using sulfur powder and red and black candles - it's mostly self-made/improved after reading up various spells online) 

9. I also tried putting our hardships in freezer a couple of weeks ago

10. I don't remember the source now, but regarding the issues at home and our familial and marital discords, I also did a peace at home spell. It uses a blue candle, five coins, and an oil blend of sandalwood, orange, rose, and lavender in sweet almond oil base. 

However, none of these have actually worked. A couple of days after the freezer spell where I had specifically mentioned banishing ""health insurance claim denial,"" a seemingly straight-forward claim for my emergency endometrial correction surgery was rejected. And the final bill came much larger than what we had anticipated, so now, we hardly have three months of runway left. 

I feel exhausted after every spell-work/energy work I've done in these past few months. Even the spells that work don't work for long enough for us to catch a breath. And even if a spell works, it's effects are not long-lasting. For instances, my husband got a rare interview call the day after I did the road-opener spell the first time, but after that, it didn't translate in to further interview rounds, a job offer, or any other interview calls. With depleting resources, money and energy, it's not possible for me to do spell after spell, week after week. And I'm not sure what to do now. 

Mostly, I rely on supermarket supplies for my spell work, given my budget at the time. And I would love to hear your ideas on the strongest/most effective cleansing, protection, and uncrossing work you've done and seen. ",1,1760886171.0,witchcraft,3,1.0,False

1oarny9,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1oarny9/nordvpn_black_friday_deal/,NordVPN Black Friday Deal,"Black Friday 2025 promises unprecedented deals on November 28th, but lurking beneath the excitement is a dangerous reality: **cyberattacks surge by 20% during the holiday shopping season**, with cybercriminals specifically targeting eager shoppers. As $8.5 billion in fraud losses demonstrate annually, the rush for discounts creates the perfect storm for digital theft.

This year, protecting your financial information isn't optional—it's essential. While NordVPN's Black Friday deal offers up to **77% off premium security**, the real question is whether you can afford *not* to secure your online shopping. Let's examine why this particular holiday season demands heightened cybersecurity awareness and how VPN protection has become non-negotiable.

# The Black Friday Cybersecurity Nightmare: 2025 Statistics

The numbers paint a sobering picture of holiday shopping risks. Research shows that **45% of holiday shoppers will face attempted cyberattacks** this season—a 5% increase from 2024. More alarming, digital fraud spikes **127% higher during Black Friday** compared to the rest of the year.

E-commerce platforms experience a **65% surge in phishing attacks** specifically timed to coincide with Black Friday sales. These sophisticated scams impersonate legitimate retailers, creating fake checkout pages designed to capture your credit card information. The 2019 Macy's Magecart attack, which compromised customers during Black Friday weekend, demonstrates how even major retailers become vectors for theft.

Financial institutions report detecting **30% more fraudulent transactions during Cyber Monday**, with card-not-present fraud being the most prevalent. Meanwhile, ransomware incidents have doubled during high-volume shopping weekends, with average demands exceeding $250,000 per incident—though consumers face their own risks through compromised personal devices.

The threat extends beyond traditional phishing. Credit card skimming malware infects online checkout pages, fake delivery notices trick buyers into revealing credentials, and malicious advertisements redirect shoppers to fraudulent sites. With 42% of shoppers willing to buy from unfamiliar sellers for the right price, cybercriminals exploit both deals and desperation.

# How VPNs Protect Black Friday Shoppers: The Technical Reality

Virtual Private Networks serve as critical defense mechanisms during the shopping frenzy, but their protection goes far beyond simple encryption. Understanding these technical safeguards reveals why security professionals consider VPNs essential for holiday shopping.

**Military-Grade Encryption Protects Payment Data**

When you connect to NordVPN, your internet traffic undergoes AES-256 encryption—the same standard used by governments, militaries, and financial institutions worldwide. This encryption creates an impenetrable tunnel between your device and the internet, making intercepted data completely unreadable to hackers.

This protection becomes crucial on public Wi-Fi networks. Coffee shops, airports, and shopping centers often provide unsecured connections that cybercriminals exploit through ""man-in-the-middle"" attacks. Your encrypted VPN connection prevents these attacks from capturing your credit card numbers, login credentials, or personal information.

**Threat Protection Pro Blocks Malicious Content**

NordVPN's Threat Protection Pro technology functions as a comprehensive security layer, blocking malicious advertisements before they load, preventing access to known phishing sites, and detecting malware downloads in real-time. During Black Friday, when fake shopping sites proliferate, this preemptive blocking stops threats before they can compromise your device.

The system maintains an updated database of malicious domains, automatically preventing connections to sites flagged for fraud, phishing, or malware distribution. This protection works even when the VPN connection is temporarily disabled, providing continuous security throughout your shopping session.

**Kill Switch Technology Prevents Data Leaks**

The automatic kill switch represents critical protection during unstable connections. If your VPN connection drops unexpectedly—common when switching between Wi-Fi networks while shopping—the kill switch immediately blocks all internet traffic. This prevents even momentary exposure of your real IP address or unencrypted data transmission.

This feature proves particularly valuable during the Black Friday rush when network congestion causes frequent disconnections. Rather than leaving you vulnerable during these brief interruptions, the kill switch maintains complete security until the encrypted connection reestablishes.

**Privacy Protection Against Dynamic Pricing**

Many retailers employ algorithmic pricing that adjusts costs based on your location, browsing history, and perceived purchasing power. Airlines, hotels, and major retailers analyze your IP address to implement geographic price discrimination—charging higher prices to customers in affluent areas or showing different deals based on your region.

A VPN masks your real location and browsing patterns, preventing this targeted price inflation. By connecting to servers in different regions, you can compare actual pricing differences and access deals that might otherwise remain hidden. This alone can save more than the VPN subscription cost during major shopping events.

NordVPN's Black Friday offering delivers up to **77% off with 3 extra months free** on 2-year plans, bringing the monthly cost down to **$2.99** for the Basic plan. This pricing structure spans four distinct tiers, each designed for different security needs.

**Plan Options and Features:**

The **Basic plan** ($2.99/month) provides the core VPN functionality: access to 7,000+ servers across 111 countries, the NordLynx protocol for maximum speed, military-grade encryption, and protection for up to 10 devices simultaneously. This represents the foundation of comprehensive online security.

The **Plus plan** adds NordPass, their zero-knowledge password manager, creating a complete authentication security solution. Strong, unique passwords across all shopping accounts prevent credential stuffing attacks—a common method cybercriminals use during high-traffic shopping periods.

The **Complete plan** bundles NordVPN, NordPass, and NordLocker (secure cloud storage), providing encrypted file protection alongside connection security. This tier suits users who handle sensitive documents or need secure storage for financial records.

The **Prime plan** introduces NordProtect—comprehensive identity theft protection including $100,000 in identity theft recovery coverage and $1,000,000 in cyber extortion protection. This enterprise-grade insurance layer addresses the worst-case scenarios of data breaches, providing financial recourse if your information is compromised despite security measures.

All plans include the 30-day money-back guarantee, allowing risk-free testing during the crucial Black Friday period. The deal runs from mid-October through early December 2025, with Black Friday (November 28) marking peak availability.

# Technical Excellence: Why NordVPN's Security Implementation Matters

Understanding the technical foundation reveals why security professionals consistently rank NordVPN among top-tier providers. The implementation details separate marketing claims from actual protection.

**NordLynx Protocol: Speed Without Compromise**

Built on the WireGuard framework, NordLynx achieves remarkable performance through elegant engineering. The protocol consists of just 4,000 lines of code—compared to OpenVPN's 70,000+ lines—making it easier to audit for vulnerabilities while delivering superior speed.

Testing demonstrates **85-90% speed retention** even on long-distance connections, with many users experiencing speeds exceeding 750 Mbps. This performance enables seamless 4K streaming and eliminates the traditional speed penalty associated with VPN protection.

The Double NAT system solves WireGuard's original privacy vulnerability. While standard WireGuard implementations store user IP addresses, NordLynx dynamically assigns temporary addresses only during active sessions, erasing all identification data when you disconnect. This technical innovation delivers both speed and genuine anonymity.

**Independent Verification and Transparency**

NordVPN has undergone four independent security audits by firms including Deloitte and PwC, verifying their no-logs policy and security implementations. These audits examine server configurations, code security, and operational practices—providing external validation of security claims rather than relying on self-certification.

The company's Panama jurisdiction places it outside Five Eyes, Nine Eyes, and Fourteen Eyes surveillance alliances. This legal framework means no mandatory data retention requirements and no obligation to comply with mass surveillance requests from intelligence agencies.

**RAM-Only Server Architecture**

NordVPN operates RAM-only servers that cannot store data permanently. Every server reboot completely wipes all information, making data retention physically impossible even if compelled by legal action. This infrastructure design ensures technical enforcement of privacy policies.

# Comparing Black Friday VPN Deals: Context Matters

While NordVPN offers compelling value at $2.99/month, understanding the competitive landscape provides perspective.

**Surfshark** undercuts at $1.99/month with unlimited simultaneous device connections, making it attractive for large households. However, it lacks the comprehensive security suite and identity protection features of NordVPN's higher tiers.

**ExpressVPN** maintains premium positioning at $4.99/month, offering excellent speeds and the proprietary Lightway protocol. The higher price reflects consistent performance but without the bundled security tools NordVPN provides.

**CyberGhost** and **Private Internet Access** both offer sub-$3 pricing, delivering solid basic VPN functionality. Neither matches NordVPN's server network scope (111 countries), advanced features like Threat Protection Pro, or identity theft protection.

The calculation extends beyond monthly cost. NordVPN's Complete and Prime plans bundle services that would cost $10-15/month separately. The identity theft insurance in the Prime plan alone provides coverage typically requiring separate expensive policies.

For Black Friday shopping specifically, NordVPN's Threat Protection Pro and comprehensive malware blocking justify the slight price premium over budget alternatives. The active threat prevention—rather than just encryption—addresses the specific risks of holiday shopping.

# Maximizing Your NordVPN Black Friday Investment

Getting the most from this deal requires strategic activation and configuration:

1. **Subscribe before Black Friday** to ensure uninterrupted protection throughout the shopping period
2. **Enable Threat Protection Pro immediately** in settings for automatic malware and phishing protection
3. **Configure the kill switch** on all devices to prevent accidental exposure
4. **Use different server locations** to compare regional pricing on major purchases
5. **Connect before accessing public Wi-Fi** at shopping centers or while traveling
6. **Pair with NordPass** (included in Plus tier and above) to generate unique passwords for new shopping accounts

The 30-day guarantee means you can utilize full protection through Black Friday and Cyber Monday, testing all features during the highest-risk period before committing long-term.

# The Bottom Line: Security as Investment, Not Expense

Black Friday 2025's threat landscape makes VPN protection non-negotiable for serious online shoppers. With cyberattacks increasing 20% and fraud losses hitting $8.5 billion annually, the question isn't whether to use a VPN—it's which one provides sufficient protection.

NordVPN's Black Friday deal delivers comprehensive security at $2.99/month while competitors offer cheaper but less complete alternatives. The combination of proven encryption, active threat prevention, extensive server infrastructure, and optional identity theft protection creates a security foundation that addresses the specific risks of holiday shopping.

The deal remains active through early December 2025, but optimal timing means subscribing before Black Friday (November 28) to ensure protection during peak vulnerability. At less than a single coffee per month, the investment protects potentially thousands of dollars in purchases and irreplaceable personal financial data.

In cybersecurity, you're either protected or you're a target. This Black Friday, choose which you'll be.

I've been suffering from gout long before I realized what it is. I'm raised old school where dealing with little aches and pains is the norm.

Over the years I would get flare ups, the  usual pain starting at the toes, moving out to the inside and upper parts of my feet. In the beginning I just popped nsaids and disregarded as just aging effects and being to much on my feet (I like to walk in Paris and woods). Over a few years symptoms turned from infrequent to regular (every few weeks or less) and to an intensity I could barely walk. It started also affecting my knees. It really started to affecty life and mobility.

I'll spare you the doctor route and medicines. I always looked at lifestyle improvements and literature on diets. I followed diet advice, reducing purine foods. Added more dark berries, etc, and I switched decaf to ""caf all day"". Drinking more coffee seemed to help, but my breakthrough moment came when I read about the importance of hydration. 

I started drinking water religiously. My routine is two glasses of water directly when I wake up. After my morning coffee and breakfast, down another two glasses, and keep on downing two glasses throughout the day. I estimate I drink at least 10 to 12 glasses of water on average.

The effects were noticeable immediately. I was suffering an attack when I started this, and within 2 days the pain and redness started subsiding. After one week most pain was gone and I had full mobility in both feet. Still some lingering little pains, but nothing compared to the daggers of shooting pains. 

And I keep improving. The numbness in my toes and feet are subsiding, I regained feelings in my feet I didn't realize I lost. I'm as good as pain-free now, and its been a long time since I popped piles of nsaids. I imagine my body is slowly flushing the crystals and able to keep my uric avid levels low with my diet and water intake. I imagine coffee still helps as being a diuretic (tho if you drink these amounts of water, you don't need diuretics)

Do people here have similar experiences? I imagine it may only work for milder cases of gout. And I think I'm also lucky to have hopefully avoided too much permanent damage from my gout, and that I found this before finally accepting medicines with side effects would become my new life.",1,1760885445.0,gout,2,0.6,False

1oarfbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartBeatStories/comments/1oarfbr/the_kindest_cruelty/,The Kindest Cruelty,"Her aunt always meant well, even when she was wrong.

It started one quiet evening in early spring. The city hadn’t quite thawed yet, but the cafés were open again, and the air carried that faint scent of wet pavement and lilac buds. I was helping her aunt bring in boxes for a charity event when she said, offhandedly, “You should meet my niece. She’s your type — shy, thoughtful, maybe a little too serious for her age.”

I laughed, thinking she was joking. But a week later, there she was — standing by the window of a small art café, holding a cup of coffee in both hands like it might slip away if she loosened her grip. Her name fit her perfectly, light and gentle, like the first syllable of a melody.

We started talking. About nothing and everything. About books, about songs, about why some people prefer silence to small talk. She smiled often, but her eyes — her eyes were always somewhere else. I thought it was just her way. I didn’t realize at first that she was in love with someone else.

It wasn’t me she was waiting for.

It was my roommate.

He didn’t even know she existed.

It was her aunt’s mistake — she’d seen us together once, my roommate and me, and assumed I was the one her niece had mentioned. She’d set us up believing she was doing something kind. And I didn’t have the heart to correct her, not right away.

I liked her too much to ruin it.

So I stayed quiet. I listened. I learned everything she liked — the songs that made her tear up, the flowers she kept pictures of on her phone, the way she said she wanted someone who noticed the little things. I told myself I’d tell her soon. That I’d tell her it was me she’d been talking to all along, not him.

But then she started mentioning my roommate more often — his voice, his work, his kindness. She built him out of the stories I told, as if each detail I shared painted him more vividly in her mind. The more she fell for that image, the more I faded into the background.

And one night, when she confessed she thought she might be in love with him, I just nodded and said I understood. Because I did.

I loved her too.

But I loved her enough to let her have what she wanted, even if it wasn’t me.

So I told him about her.  
I told him everything — how she laughed when she was nervous, how she adored tulips, how that one song always seemed to follow her. I told him she’d been hinting at loving him every time I was with her. He looked confused, even a little guilty, but I pushed him anyway. “Just meet her,” I said. “You’ll see.”

And I arranged it all.  
The time, the place, the song.  
Her favorite restaurant, her favorite flowers, the perfect moment I’d always imagined — only now it wasn’t for me.

That’s how I ended up sitting a few tables away from her, watching the whole thing unfold.

I was sitting a few tables away from her, watching as the guy who was supposed to meet her before me finally arrived. The restaurant softly played her favorite song in the background—one she’d once said made the world feel less cruel. He handed her a small bouquet of tulips, the kind she adored.

He smiled, pretending he’d thought of it all himself, pretending he liked the same songs, the same little things that made her eyes light up. But he didn’t. I did. I’d arranged their meeting. I was the one who told him everything—what she loved, what made her laugh, even the way she’d talk about him when she thought I wasn’t listening.

I was her friend. Just a friend.  
And she had no idea how much more I wanted to be.

Her aunt appeared at my table a little later. She’d always been sharp, the kind of woman who noticed things others missed.  
“Do you regret it?” she asked quietly.

I frowned, unsure what she meant at first. “Regret what?”

She looked at me as if I’d said something ridiculous. “I’m not blind,” she said softly. “I see how you look at her. And now the girl you love is sitting there with another.”

I looked back at her—at the smile that wasn’t meant for me, at the laughter I’d helped create—and forced myself to answer.  
“She’s finally happy,” I said, keeping my voice steady even as it trembled at the edges. “That’s what matters most.”

I managed a smile, but it didn’t last. The moment I looked away, my chest ached with the truth—  
I’d given her to someone else.  
And it was the kindest, cruelest thing I’d ever done.

The night ended like a slow fade-out. They left together, her hand brushing his as they walked past my table. She didn’t see me — or maybe she did, and just didn’t know what to say.

Her aunt squeezed my shoulder before she followed them out. “Someday, someone will do the same for you,” she said.

I didn’t answer. I just sat there, surrounded by the fading notes of her favorite song and the scent of tulips that weren’t mine to give.

Outside, the streetlights hummed. I could almost hear her laughter carried away by the wind — soft, distant, untouchable.

And I told myself, over and over, that love sometimes means stepping aside.  
But that night, it didn’t feel like love.  
It felt like loss dressed as kindness.",0,1760885088.0,HeartBeatStories,0,0.5,False
1oarf5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/1oarf5o/variation_on_a_swear_jar/,Variation on a swear jar?,"TL;DR: For four high school English classes (10th-12th), could it be helpful to have a jar where if they catch me doing a habit I don't want to do (like saying ""gonna"" instead of ""going to"") I put a dollar in. But if I catch them doing a language offense that is not referral-worthy but a habit worth breaking (like a quiet, non-distracting ""sh*t"" to their partner), a dollar comes out? (They don't owe a dollar, just from dollars I already put in from my own money). I then take the money to buy coffee shop treats for everyone, let's say on Fridays. Good idea? Bad idea? Things I need to change to make it work?

More detail:

Note that I teach part time with classes ranging 12-26 students, about 60 total kids per day. I try to avoid any consequences for language at this level because I don't want to create an atmosphere of too much self-censorship. It's hard when, let's say, the word f*g is in Irish literature referring to a cigarette. Then Literature can have sexual references too. My current guideline is know your audience and no gratuitous language; make it rare, purposeful and not just a lack of regulation (so a student who rarely says the F word in quiet tones I ignore, but if it's regular, we have a chat). 

Anyway, I'm in my 5th year and overall this works well, but as the year goes on I feel they push it too much. Should I have harsher guidelines, like if I hear the F word, office referral, period? I feel like I would have to break down every questionable word and context and it would just get weird. So here's my idea:

I talk about how we all have language habits we can improve on. I feel I say slurred contractions like 'gonna' more than I would like. If a student catches me? I put a dollar in the gonna/wanna/hafta jar. If a student cusses or use a borderline gross/sexual reference? I take a dollar out (severe cases or actual harassment still follow discipline channels). I then take the money to buy treats from the coffee shop for them, etc.

I feel like about up to $40 per month would be worth it for me for the class engagement, with them listening to my words in case I slip up. If they get too many dollars out, I can always accidentally-on-purpose say a gonna/wanna/hafta offense. As my habit or their habit improves, I can switch the jar to another language challenge I have or the class has.

General interests include: being highly competitive, Toronto Blue Jays Baseball, NFL football, being grandparents/parents/aunts and uncles, being at the cottage (so boating, swimming, nature), and generally being active. Given the theme, I'm struggling to see how a consumable product would cater to most of these interests. 

  
Any ideas? What is the best White Elephant gift you've ever gotten that was also a consumable? Thanks all!

I appreciate it may seem unfair to compare to what you get from you local coffee shop… but why not? The pods are fairly expensive as is & a large part of the cost when you buy from a coffee shop is the rent and covering wages. 
So why on earth is it okay for them to charge so much for artificial tasting pods.

(This is such a bad exaggerated example, but I’m just saying to get my point across) but it resembles more like a hot cup of soya sauce with no salt than a rich coffee (yes horrible example😂)

I assume OL is closer as it can pull espressos, but even with that, each pod is a single shot so to get any standard coffee you need to use two pods. Which price wise is near exact same as vertuo (so why people act like OL is cheaper is beyond me) 

This is more of a rant than anything.
How difficult is it to make a machine that makes good double espressos via pods/capsules. For the amount they charge just seems ridiculous.

I've never taken a cruise and I don't really know much about the ins & outs or culture of cruising. When I do trip searches, I can see a few trips and itineraries that are available before the end of the year, but I honestly don't know which cruiseline or trip to choose, so I've come to the experts for advice. Trip dates are not really an issue as long as it's before the end of 2025, and length looks like a moot point; most of the trips I'm seeing out of NY/NJ are 7-8 days in length, which is plenty.

Given the below details, which cruise would you take and when would you take it if you were in my solo 30F shoes: MSC Meraviglia Bahamas, Royal Caribbean Perfect Day Bahamas Odyssey of the Seas, or Norwegian Bahamas Breakaway?

* Budget: Flexible, but eyeing $2k USD or less for everything
* Accommodations: I would like a cabin with a balcony and I'm thinking this is non-negotiable. I envision most of my time being spent sitting and looking out at the water; to do so from the comfort of my room would be great. :)
* Food: I'm a vegetarian, in case that elevates one cruise line over another in terms of fit. And I'd be an ""early diner"" as far as cruises are concerned. I'm not much of a drinker, but some sort of house wine or cocktail package might intrigue me depending on the price. That said, I'm definitely more of a diet soda and coffee junkie than a drinker.
* Vibe: If there is any one cruise or itinerary that would mean fewer kids, I'd probably lean that way. Nothing against kids, I just don't want to deliberately pay for an R&R vacation where I end up around screaming kids 24/7 if I can avoid it.
* Social: I'm interested in live entertainment/shows/trivia/game nights, but not clubbing or partying. And not interested in meeting men on the cruise.
* Random: I am a runner so the idea of nice treadmills or, even better, a jogging track on the ship is super appealing to me.
* Ports/Itinerary: This is the biggest question mark to me. I have no idea how port days work or what you can do at the ports. Can I just sit on the beach or do I have to pay? Can I come and go to and from the ship as I please? Could I go for a run at a port? Whichever trip or cruiseline makes it easiest to dip my toes in the ocean for a while, maybe go for a run on land, and then come back aboard an hour or two later would be great.",1,1760884692.0,Cruise,5,0.67,False

1oar7a7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1oar7a7/accidentally_sober/,Accidentally sober,"Has anyone just stumbled on sobriety?

I’m a heavy drinker, 44F. I’ve always enjoyed a drink but it got really bad during Covid when we were sent to WFH, and I haven’t really stopped since - this can be anywhere from 6-12 drinks a night, I’ll consider it a win if I kept it to 4. My partner has brought it up to me numerous times, I’ll ’behave’ for a bit (in other words, I’ll keep it to the minimal when he’s around but sneak away to top myself off). Then he gave up discussing it and just let me do my thing. 

We travelled to his sister’s last weekend for Thanksgiving (Canadian!), and I went from Saturday to Monday without a drink. Back to work Tuesday and debating hitting the liquor store on the way home and before I knew it, I was there. Polished off 9 drinks that night, felt gross the whole time. Next day rolls around, and when I would normally have to hit the store cos I was only down to three now and panic would set in, I just went home. 

Thursday, same thing. No inclination to drink, made a coffee when I got home instead of knocking back my usual dose of ciders. 

Friday - had one, felt gross, switched to coffee. Normally, if I felt gross after one I would pound two more til the gross feeling went away. 

Saturday - feeling good about myself! Didn’t think about HAVING a drink, instead thought of the progress I made. Instead of making excuses to ‘go to the grocery store’, I looked at my bank account without that sinking feeling of knowing my balance would be well below where it should be. 

This morning, I’ve laid out a plan to keep myself busy, but again - the urge just isn’t there. It’s weird, normally I would wake up knowing I’m gonna put my errands off til the liquor store opens so I can add that to my stops. I’m just not feeling it today!

I don’t know where this is going, but I do know it’s time for me to get control over myself. We want to go to Greece next year, I don’t want to be mistaken for a bloated whale carcass that washed up on the beach. 

I know my partner has noticed I haven’t drank. I’m scared to bring it up with anyone else, it’s become such a part of my identity that I have family members that will likely make a joke of it and make me feel like shit because of my past. ‘Wonder how long this will last’, you know the drill. So I’ve been ignoring my phone. 

I’m proud of myself for the last few days. I’m not sure how I came to this juncture but I really just wanted to get this off my chest in front of people that would understand where I’m coming from. I’ve been lurking on this sub for awhile, thought about posting but never had the courage. Today, I do. I’m crying as I’m typing this but not out of guilt or shame - but out of pride!!

It might come off as being silly or despo or whatever but I’m really sorry  and tbh I don't give a fuck at this point of 4 lot and 4 baatein (with utmost respect). 

Tbh I am looking for a honest friends with benefits or casual relationship as we say now with a women. I’m not much into looks of women either I really don’t care at this point.  What I am looking  is someone who is kind, honest, respectful and one who values empathy and wit or humour. I would like to explore places around go on unplanned dates hop to cafés or pubs do all the stuff I’ve thought to but couldn’t do just get. Ideally she should also have some sort of clarity regarding what she wants, sexually very open and not afraid to be herself. This is what I’m seeking at this point. 

Well id also bring the same traits from my side openness, communicative and not afraid of society and those 4 people who’ll always crib no matter what we do. I don't have any preference  about her age ideally someone my age tbh but she should be an adult.

I also want to spend some quality time doing simple things ; like take a walk in park , cycling, impromptu tea or coffee meet ups, dinner, movie nights weekend Netflix binge and all. Maybe it might sound being desperate but that’s not case I’ve been to dates and had opportunities but mostly people are looking for long term and commitment and it’s not I’m afraid of these things it’s just I haven’t cracked the code of my life yet I feel. So hence I never got involved with anyone to save them and myself from all the drama, bs and lying and pretending. 

I got the much needed clarity recently what i want thanks to festival holidays I feel there’s a giant hole left in my life which I’m healing slowly thanks to gym and meditation which was caused due to past failed relationship causing feeling of being along or something. I am not looking for anything serious or long term but it need not be meaningless either. I would like to experience intimacy and explore it all possible ways with right person who also shares similar value maybe we can trauma bond too and help each other out in some ways.

I am looking for something like some co passengers in a journey where we sometimes meet  people unexpectedly and have good conversations and when their station arrives we neither have any expectations to meet them or any regret just a fond memory of the conversation. There’s no attachments, drama, trauma , resentment, and all such emotions.

The girls I met till now not many though but from dating apps mostly are looking for long term relationships. But since I didn’t want to commit I never took next step. Well lastly I’d just like to meet someone like minded women we can start of by being just strangers and take further depending on vibe and all.

To tell something personal about me I work in IT and I’m from Maharashtra Nashik . I speak Hindi, Marathi and English fluently and Telugu too I have learnt little but thanks to my work colleague pushing me to watch OG South Indian movies. My hobbies for now are gym, music, sports like cricket, TT, badminton with friends. I also like to try new food explore new places sit hours watching clouds passing by us at a quiet place or just near around a lake for hours doing nothing. I’m not into drugs or cigs or anything also I don’t drink maybe once in 3 months. 

Hope it will reach someone who can relate and going through same cycles of life. I also would like to apologies if this is inappropriate for others genuinely. Hope to find someone lastly 😅.

How were my first seven days? I would give it 0 stars.  My emotions have been deregulated, and I have been a mess.  But I'm proud of myself for making it this far, I'm proud of myself for showing up to work and performing at the high level that is expected of me, for showing up for my family and friends, and for not getting in my car, driving into the woods, and never coming back (I Google mapped the exact spot).

I'm sure my family and friends are tired of me talking about it, but im going to keep talking about it until  I run out of words., I feel like at this point I have cried an ocean for the girl and that's okay. When the feelings come in waves, grab your board and ride it out until its over. 

How have I been sleeping? Not great, 4/5 hours a night, its fun to go to sleep at 9 and wake up at midnight having a full panic attack because you have dreamed about them. Then you can get yourself backt to sleep so you spiral for hours binge watching youtube videos about avoidant exs, you search the entire internet to find out when and if they will come back and to come to the conclusion that no one knows and if they say they know they want a ton of money only to tell you they dont know (dont worry I didnt pay anyone, I almost did, cooler heads prevailed). 

How am I doing this morning? Well, images of us and all our adventures are playing in my head, and I can't make it stop, so I'm sitting here writing the wittiest post I can, and reading and responding to other people's posts. I got up to make coffee this morning only to remember the only coffee I did have I left at my ex's, which, if that isn't a shame that both her and my coffee left me, im going to work on being more sad about the coffee. 

Do I miss her? Absolutely, I begged God (not really religious) on Friday night to bring her back, that I would give up everything for her to come back. I also tried to bargain with him that if he couldn't bring her back to at least send me back in time so I could at least fix it, which then got my wanting the watch Back to the Future, then got depressed because I don't know how to make a flux capacitor, nor do I own a Delorean. Sorry, I got off track. There are pieces of her scattered in my mind all day, every day, idk when that will change. I hope it's soon because it's exhausting.

  
In closing, I want her back more than anything, to fix things more than anything, but she has to come to the table; she has to make the first move, or else it will never work, and that makes me sad. Its like being in the Cold War with an enemy you love and want, maybe that's how the Cold War ended, Russia gave in and came back to the talking stage with America. Because I'm a fixer and I'm a control freak by nature, and I can't do any of those things. Only time will tell, and until it tells Im going to focus on what I can control,l which is myself. Finally, for those looking for a philosophy that will help you with control and letting go, I suggest Stoicism. Maybe when I get the energy, Ill write a post for you kind folks about it.

Today is 21 days since I had 4047 grafts done with Dr. Laorwong at Absolute Hair Clinic in Bangkok and the ugly duckling phase has started!   
  
From the outset, I want to say how grateful I am for this group and those who've taken the time to post pictures and respond to questions. From reading posts over several months, I learned a lot! I'd thought about a Hair Transplant many times over the years.  It is because of this group that I gained the confidence to take action. Not just action, but I made good choices that I'm sure will pay off in time. 

For those who have gone through the procedure, this is probably a long boring post. But I wanted to put it here to ""pay it forward"" for people considering Bangkok and because other people did this and it really helped me.  

**Initial Consult:** all done via email and over WhatsApp.  Sent pics and answered the screening questions. Was given a list of available dates. I wanted Dr Panchaprateep, but she was booked solid for the next 6 Months. Dr. Laorwong had availability for dates that suited me.  Was quoted 2000-2500 grafts @ 90 THB per graft.  It was the most expensive quote - pretty much Western prices. I had three clinics that could fit me in and two that were much cheaper. I went with this clinic based on reputation and the excellent results others in this group experienced.   
  
**Booking Surgery:** It was a little annoying. Slow communication. Many emails. Finally confirmation and asked to pay THB 35,000 deposit.  Chased them multiple times to send confirmation.  Finally, they responded with confirmation and a pre-op instructions sheet. Also offered a list of hotels.   
  
**Accommodation:** The clinic is directly next to BTS Station Krung Thon Buri... so getting there is easy as long as you stay somewhere within walking distance of the dark green line. I stayed at Pullman G in Silom.  It's a great area to hang out. Plenty to do and great food options. Highly recommend this hotel. It was affordable.. absolutely amazing breakfast and 3 mins walk away from Chong Nonsi BTS... and then only 3 stops to Thon Buri.  If you wanted affordable option you could try Holiday Inn Express near Chong Nonsi.. also Amara... or Cascade (the clinics recommended hotel)   
   
**Day before surgery:**  Filled in a lot of paperwork. Did a screening blood test for HIV. Waited to see the Dr more than 1 hour.  Transferred rooms 4 times.  Laorwong came in and as others have mentioned... he is softly spoken and a man of very few words. He asked me about allergies and what medication I am taking. Looked at my hair a long time saying nothing... I was anticipating bad news.  Then he said... You are a perfect candidate. Your donor area is very thick. Let's do a lot more grafts. We can do 4000.  I am a bit shocked because this is almost double the cost. I told him I don't think I can afford it, he said the cost for 4000grafts  is THB 80 per graft. I agreed to go ahead.  He asked me how I normally wear my hair. He said... I think we just follow your natural hairline and drew it on with a texta.   This is maybe an area I should have given more thought to and had an opinion about. Based on a strong reputation, I just agreed. I think in hindsight, I might have gone maybe 1cm lower than his hairline.   They gave me pre-op instructions which involved washing your hair night before and in the morning with antiseptic shampoo

**Day of surgery:**  Arrived at the clinic at 8:00am. They took payment from me for remaining balance and I noticed the bill was more expensive than anticipated. That's for the Rigenera Live Cell Therapy, they said... I asked what's that.. they struggled to explain.. and said.. you don't have to do it.. but we recommend. I agreed. Taken upstairs, change into a surgical gown. They give me valium, antibiotics, and a pain pill. Asked what I would like for lunch. They shaved my head. There's a safe to lock away your valuables. Thanks for the advice here. I had my phone and some earbuds and podcasts cued up.  
  
First part involved lying face down 3.5 hours for extraction. One of the nurses is massaging my legs rigourously for a couple mins to distract me.. another using some sort of vibrating thing on my head I can't see.  Several needles.  As people have said.. yes they hurt... very unpleasant...  but honestly bearable .. because all up there's only about 4 or 5 and it's all over fast enough. Some of the other guys told me the clinic offers nitrous oxide (laughing gas) as an option prior to the needles... I wasn't offered this option. The other guys really enjoyed tripping on it but I personally don't think it was necessary for something that is over in a couple mins. 

To this day, I honestly don't know how much of the time Dr Laorwong was in the room and how much of my surgery he performed. This is a concern. He never spoke to me once during the procedure. I didn't see him. Once the vallium kicked in, I was drifting in and out. The extraction was lots of scratching type feelings.. not too unpleasant. I needed water couple of times and a nurse gave me bottle with a straw. Also needed one bathroom break.. they helped me to bathroom  
  
They woke me around 1:00pm and said... we are done with the extraction.. go have some lunch. Food and drink waiting for me. It was an excellent meal.  They really pushed me fast, as they said it would be a long day otherwise.

Back in the surgery room.  This time lying face up. Cloth over my eyes. Again, I drifted in and out. When I woke up, there's a team of 4 nurses, technicians working on me.  Lots of dull stabbing type feelings as they do the implants. They are talking loudly and making lots of jokes/laughing. They had music playing. I speak a little Thai so I joined in the conversation. Lots of silly small talk. The nurses joking about how they need a sugar daddy so they don't have to work so hard. I asked them how hard they work... they said  8:30am to 8:30pm six days a week and on a bad day, they work 16 hours.   
  
I asked them where is Dr Laorwong. They said, He made all the holes in your head and set the hair direction and we are just inserting the grafts in each hole. I honestly never saw him. I had a couple of quick stops for water and toilet break and they are pushing me on.  
  
Surgery finished at 8:00pm. They bandaged my head, put a bandana on, took me back to my room asked me if I had a shirt to put on. They had spare shirts if I had forgotten.  Gave me a bag of medication and instructions for the next 7 days.    
  
They took me downstairs and said, **you need to pay some extra**. I asked why. They said. You paid for 4000 grafts, we were able to do 4047 today.  I really **don't agree** with this practice because I was out of it, and there was no way to consent at the time. Plus, I think for all the upsells they gave me, a few extras could be offered to the client as a bonus. There is really no way to know for sure how many grafts were implanted. You have to take their word for it. I  called a Grab (Thai equivalent of Uber) back to my hotel.   
  
**Aftercare:**  Surgery included 5 days of aftercare and there is an option to buy extra after-care at THB1500 a day.  5 is the minimum which I did and a lot of guys added an extra 2 days. After day 5, I felt confident doing my own aftercare.   Also an option to purchase hyperbaric oxygen tank therapy which is supposed to speed up healing.  They offer you one free session and package deal to purchase 4 more. I purchased. So many upsells at this clinic.   
  
After care involved spending an hour in the hyperbaric chamber. You can take your phone in there and I listened to podcasts.  What they didn't tell me but I disovered on Day 3 that there is a lever to adjust the pressure/intensity.  So by day #3 I am cranking it up full.  After that, 30 mins of red laser light therapy.. lying on a bed. Then the nurse washes your hair, applies antibiotic ointment and puts a clean bandana on. They organise your next appointment and you're free to go. 

Over the next 7 days, I met so many guys all undergoing the procedure at Absolute and at different stages of the journey. We formed a WhatsAPP group called Bandana Boys.  I can't thank them enough. Our little community really helped us all get through the next days. So much practical support offered, and at different times we hung out together for entertainment, chatting, meals and shopping. It really was an unexpected but amazing part of the journey.  To this day, Bandana Boys group is still supporting each other and new boys are being added all the time. 

I really urge you ... if you are going through the procedure, reach out and talk to the other men as you meet them at the clinic, it will make a big difference practically and emotionally. Some of the guys were very afraid, being in a foreign country and feeling uncertain. Others, were experienced with Bangkok or had undergone previous procedures. Sharing the journey made it easier by far.    
  
One thing we all had in common, we were all having a great experience at Absolute and felt the care and facilities were very strong. 

On day #5 of the aftercare, Dr Laorwong came in, looked at my scalp and said... it looks very good. Yes, he is a man of few words!  He asked if I needed medication and said the clinic can provide.  He recommended 2.5 mg of oral minoxidil daily and 1mg of Finasteride 3-5 times a week.  I asked for a year's supply of Minoxidil and Finasteride and the cost was about THB 4000 and they provided a Doctors letter for customs declaration.  I found you can also easily purchase the medication at Thai pharmacies over the counter. 

For the first 2 days, I took it easy... a bit of walking around and hanging in the hotel. I think it is really useful to have a NICE hotel and NICE breakfast, but obviously you don't need the pool and gym. Plus, you need your hotel to be accessible to shopping malls and places where you can hang out for short periods, so you can return to the hotel to rest. For this reason, I liked my choice of Pullman G Silom better than the recommended Cascade hotel.   
  
By day #3, I am walking around most of the day and just taking breaks in coffee shops and malls.  I did stay away from alcohol, but I still drank one coffee every day and some Thai Milk tea.  I ate at some amazing street venues - great food... Highly recommend Mama Mia in Silom. Other things that helped. I asked Absolute for an extra bandana, took it to a local tailor, and they were able to copy it, but with much nicer fabric and make one that fit my head better.  I had foot massages, ate mango sticky rice, and basically had a lovely week.   
  
Absolute asked me to sleep with a neck pillow, I didn't have one, they provided. I think it's worth finding one you like, since you need to use it for the first 7-10 days.  Also, sleeping on your back is a challenge. I am a side sleeper. I used sleeping tablets. My friend, who is a nurse, told me how to arrange the bed to stay sleeping on your back and not roll over using 3 pillows, illustrated here. It makes it a LOT easier  
  
Overall, I can say my experience at Absolute was mixed ... they have practices that I don't like... but I felt the facilities and staff were top rate and information and aftercare made things progress very easily. All of the amazing Bandana boys all had similar experiences.    
  
On the flight home to Australia, I met a man who was returning from Turkey after just having the surgery. We compared experiences.  He was shoved out the door on Day 3. His head looked much more of a mess. He had no bandana.. I gave him one of mine and insisted he wear it for protection. With airfare taken into account, he had paid a similar amount for his surgery and was not as satisfied as I was and had much less aftercare. Plus it sounded like Bangkok was a much more pleasant place to hang for a week during recovery. ",8,1760884057.0,HairTransplants,9,1.0,False

I usually brew into the standard glass carafe and then pour into a 1000ml insulated carafe to hold heat to enjoy at my leisure throughout the morning. 

On occasion,  I'll get a new coffee  that I want to enjoy one cup at a time before I start my daily pot. Or I'll want a single afternoon cup. 

Is there any benefit to having a smaller v60 to do a single cup if I'm brewing by time/ weight, or is just making a smaller batch in the larger brewer the same?

Welcome back, Week 7 is here!

For anyone new, every week I take Vegas lines and odds and convert them into projected fantasy points. Then I compare those projections against DraftKings, FanDuel and OwnersBox salaries to calculate a value score. This helps highlight who's overpriced and who’s underpriced.

These plays tend to be chalky/high ownership, so I typically use them for double-ups, but you’re free to use the info however you want.


⚠️ Disclaimer

- No such thing as a lock — use at your own risk.

- Not betting advice — just my process and what works for me.

- I post for free. Use it, fade it, roast it — up to you.


🔑 Core Plays

I run an optimizer for every slate to identify the strongest builds. Since sharing full lineups is against T&C (and would just have everyone running the same thing anyway), here are a few core plays the optimizer is high on:

- QB: TBD

- RB: Quinshon Judkins, Breece Hall

- WR: Rashee Rice

- TE: Zach Ertz

- DST: TBD

It had been six years, but she was still there — somewhere between the edge of my dreams and the quiet hours of morning when the world hadn’t woken up yet. I used to lie on my back staring at the ceiling, wondering if she ever thought about me too. I’d tell myself I was over it, that people move on, but then a song would come on, or the rain would start, and it’d all come rushing back like it never left.
It wasn’t just missing her — it was missing us, the version of me that existed when she was around. Back then, life had a softness to it. I used to laugh easier, sleep better. Now, even in silence, it felt like the air was heavier.
I’d dream about her often. Sometimes we were back in school, standing under that same evergreen tree, rain dripping through the branches while the world blurred around us. Other times she was just out of reach — walking away down some long street I couldn’t follow. I’d wake up with my heart racing, my chest tight, half expecting to see her standing there like she used to. But it was always just me, in a quiet room, the hum of the fridge in the background, the night stretching on too long.
I tried everything to forget — the Air Force, the bars, the smoke, the long drives down roads that led nowhere. I thought maybe if I filled my life with enough noise, I could drown out the ache. But no matter where I went, she followed. Not in body, but in memory — the sound of her laugh, the way she’d tilt her head when she smiled. It wasn’t even that I thought we’d end up together again. It was that the part of me that had felt alive with her hadn’t found anywhere else to go.
Sometimes I wondered if I loved her because she was the only person who ever made me feel seen — not like a mistake, not like a burden, just me. The world had always been rough with me. I learned early that love came with strings or conditions, and I didn’t know what to do when it didn’t. With her, it was simple. For a little while, I got to feel what it was like to belong.
People told me I should move on. “It’s been years,” they’d say, like there was an expiration date for heartbreak. But grief doesn’t follow a calendar. It just lingers — quiet, patient. It waits for the right silence to creep back in.
There were nights when the quiet got too loud. I’d sit in the dark with nothing but my thoughts, the memories looping like old film reels. Her voice, her eyes, the rain — everything clearer than it had any right to be after all that time. I’d ask myself if maybe I was just holding onto a ghost, but then again, sometimes ghosts are all you have left.
Still, I kept going. Every morning I woke up felt like a small kind of victory. The coffee didn’t taste like much, the days all blurred together, but I was still here. Still breathing. That counted for something.
It’s strange — the world feels smaller now. When I was young, it always seemed too big to hold onto. Too fast, too loud, too unforgiving. Now, it’s the quiet that gets me. The spaces between things. The empty seat across the table. The echo of laughter that isn’t there anymore.
I don’t know if I’ll ever see her again. Maybe that’s for the best. I wouldn’t even know what to say if I did. But sometimes, when the sky turns that deep blue right before night fully falls, I catch myself thinking about her. Wondering where she is, if she’s happy, if she ever remembers that boy who kissed her in the rain.
And even if she doesn’t — even if I’m just another face from her past — part of me still hopes that somewhere, in some quiet moment, she feels the same pull. Because the truth is, I’ve loved her longer than I’ve known how to stop.",1,1760884005.0,u_Acrobatic_Share_4011,0,1.0,False
1oaqzl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1oaqzl8/getting_in_shape_throughout_junior_year/,Getting in shape throughout junior year,"First of all, I’m not posting a picture of physique because of weird people on the site.  I (M16) started junior year a month ago and because of school work and extracurricular activities, I haven’t really been able to workout at the gym.  I do have workout equipment like the treadmill and an older Bowflex machine in my basement, but I occasionally forget since I have to do homework and go out with my parents (I also get distracted by video games).  I think I’m doing fine with my arms, but I really dislike the fact that for years, despite trying to cut back, my gut still looks kinda big and makes me look and feel fat or overweight.  I also get bullied sometimes for my “man boobs” which sometimes has the nipples sticking out, which is what really made me start working out.

Food-wise, I’ve been trying to cut back on sugar and just generally unhealthy stuff.  At restaurants that have rice options, I used to get white rice, but now I get brown rice because it’s apparently healthier.  I’ve also started consuming fried stuff very infrequently, reduced sugar intake, and just overall changed my eating habits, especially when it comes to snacks in between meals.  Although I don’t like coffee without any sweet flavor, I’ve been reducing how much sugar I put in it by adding maybe just one packet of sugar and getting some zero sugar creamer.  I’ve also stopped eating breakfast during school weeks, but idk if that’s exactly OK to do.

I can’t bench a lot and my workout schedule’s been somewhat inconsistent due to things inside and outside of school, but I try to at least some aspect of exercise everyday, especially since I have to walk all nine holes every time I do golf on Sundays (like today).  But honestly, how can I do better?  Is it the lack of motivation and commitment that makes me just not feel like doing exercise in my free time?  Is there something I can do to control my food habits, especially when it comes to feeling hungry before and after meals?  What can I do to my schedule to make my workouts a lot more frequent and actually enjoyable?  Any advice is appreciated!

Edit: I’ve also been very focused on hydrating myself a lot everyday, but I know it’s bad to both overhydrate and not get enough water.",1,1760883999.0,teenagers,3,1.0,False
1oaqz8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oaqz8y/my_mother_passed_and_i_still_follow_her_little/,My mother passed and I still follow her little rituals,"Knock. Knock. Knock.

I drag myself out of bed and tap the wall above me. Three times. The plaster is cold under my knuckles, and the echo hums like the house is listening. Mum used to say it didn’t like surprises.

Slippers on. Bed made, corners tight, sheets smooth. Pillows must touch at the corners.
Window open. Door open.
Closet check. Check again. Open, shut, pause. Open, shut. Move on.

I sigh as I approach the door.
Light on. Off. On. Off.
Then to the window again.
Curtains pulled halfway, then fully, then half again. The folds have to line up.
I run my finger along the sill for ten seconds. Dust gathers beneath my nail. I wipe it away after counting out loud.
The floorboards creak as I step into the hallway. I count each one. Seven. Always seven.
If I don’t hear the creaks, I start again.

The bathroom mirror waits for me, fogged though the air is cold. I breathe on it and draw a small circle before stepping into the shower for three minutes. Two cold, one hot.
The steam frames my circle in the mirror. I stare at it. My reflection looks tired.
I whisper good morning to her, then wipe the glass clean. The streaks have to fade evenly.

In the kitchen, everything feels quieter.
The hum of the fridge, the soft scrape of the chair against tile. I make tea in the same mug, with the same teaspoon. The water must boil first but stop just before the bubbles, no steam. Then pour. Wait three breaths before adding the milk. The spoon must rest straight across the rim when I’m done stirring.

I set the mug down and walk to the sink. I take the cup from the bench and place it in the sink. It hadn’t been used but it had to be there. 
Now the tap has to run. Cold first, then hot, then cold again. I let it flow as I sip my tea. After ten mouthfuls, I turn off the water and let the quiet fill the room.

The clock ticks in the next room. I count six seconds, then listen for the creak above me. The ceiling always answers with one soft pop, like a sigh.
Only then can I breathe.

Mum used to say the house doesn’t like surprises. She would whisper it every morning, soft enough that I thought she was talking to the walls.

After doing my makeup, I grab my coat, open the front door, and carried her quiet insistence with me.

My phone vibrates. I smile at the movement because I know exactly who it is.

Meet you at the usual place babe?

Absolutely :D

The street feels alive in a way the house never does. Cars hum in the distance, a dog barks somewhere behind a fence, and the sound of my shoes on the pavement feels light. I catch a rhythm in the tapping, I almost want to match it, then shake my head. It passes.

By the time I reach the café, the morning finally feels ordinary. My head isn’t counting. The folds, the water, the creaks. They all stay behind the door. I let myself smile at the reflection in the glass, letting the thoughts of Luke perk me up.

He’s already there, near the window, that lopsided grin he can’t hide. “Hey,” he says, standing to kiss my cheek. “You look good.”

“Do I?” I smile back. “You seem…”

“Tired? Late night.” He stifles a yawn. “Work stuff.”

We sit, the usual spot. His black coffee arrives while I get my latte. The barista knows our order now and makes it without our input. She winks at the both of us playfully as Luke hands her cash.

“How’s the house?” Luke asks once we’ve settled. “Gotten any better since Mum?”

I stir my drink slowly. “The same still.” I sigh. A pause. A small, private memory surfaces. Mum standing by the kettle, turning it off before it fully boils. I shake it away.

He reaches over, hand covering mine. “Ok, I won’t talk about her. What about you? Are you ok?”

“Yeah,” I say. Letting the feeling pass through me, fleeting. “It’s… hard. Definitely quieter now.”

An employee taps from the counter making me catch my breath for a second. One, two, three. I let it go. Luke’s hand is still there.

“I just follow my routines. Feels like she’s still there sometimes,” I say quietly.

“Wait… as in like a morning routine?” His brow furrows, curiosity mixed with concern.

“Yeah.” I trace the rim of my mug, letting the warmth steady me. “She made me do it. I’ve always done it. I… I think it’s OCD.”

Luke blinks, surprised. “You think?”

I nod, shrugging. “Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. That’s what it feels like to me. Counting, aligning, checking… it’s all too familiar.”

He leans back, silent for a moment, letting my words sink in. “So it’s not just, like, making your bed then having your toast?”

I shake my head, almost embarrassed. “Not really. It’s a lot more than that.” I glance at him, letting the pause speak for me.

I look at the lovely man in front of me, noticing the way he watches me, the way his eyes soften but his mind is clearly racing. I still struggle to fathom life without him, even though it’s only been a few months. His mouth begins to move again.

“Ok… I’ve never noticed it out here. Not at work, or here,” Luke says, brow furrowed.

“No,” I reply, stirring my latte. “It’s at home. Only at home.”

“I don’t understand. Is it just the morning?”

I shake my head, feeling the memory grip me. “Night as well. I… I haven’t slept at another person’s house in… well, I don’t know how long. One time, I snuck out and tried to stay at a friend’s place, but by the time I got there, I had to go home. I didn’t do the thing.”

He studies me quietly, his hand still over mine. “The thing?”

“The routines. The counting, the aligning… it’s not optional. If I don’t do it, I… I feel wrong. I can’t sleep, I can’t eat. I have to do it.” I look down at my mug, tracing the rim. “That’s why you only see me during the day. I have to do it.”

Luke leans back, his chair creaking as it rocks gently. My leg bounces steadily, betraying the tension I try to hide. “You know… if you want, you could stay at my place tonight.” He offers.

My heart skips. I look up at him, surprised. “Um… I don’t know. I just said that…”

His hand steadies my vibrating thigh, and I flutter.

“Don’t worry. I’ll help you. Make sure you’re safe. You don’t have to go home and do the things if you don’t want to.” His other hand tightens over mine, gentle but grounding.

A warmth spreads through me, almost making me forget the counting, the aligning, the rituals. I can’t help the little smile that spreads across my face. “You’d do that?”

“Of course,” he says softly. “I just want you to feel normal for once. No routines, no panic, no rules.”

I bite my lip, trying to steady my racing heart. The thought of being somewhere else, with him, even just for one night, makes me swoon inside. Almost like I could… almost like I could belong somewhere else.

Then his tone shifts, hesitant but determined. “Maybe… after tonight, you could try skipping one small thing. Just one. See how it feels.”

I freeze. The idea stabs into me like a knife. My fingers tighten around the mug. “Skip… something?”

“Yeah,” he says, gentle, coaxing. “Nothing crazy. Just… break the pattern, even a little. You might see it’s not as bad as it feels.”

I swallow hard. My chest tightens. My mind flashes through countless mornings and nights—the ceiling creaks, the mirror, the doors, the lights. The house would be unattended. It needs me.

Then I glance at him again, at the concern in his eyes, the soft curve of his mouth, and my chest softens. I want to trust him. I want to try, just this once.

The day passes almost too quickly. With Luke, time feels soft and forgiving. I can sit without counting, touch without aligning, breathe without checking. But it seems over before I can truly enjoy it, the thought of going home lingering in the back of my mind.

As we arrive at his apartment, I take in its colours, its smell and style. I smile again in genuine happiness seeing someone else’s residence. He hands me a spoon unexpectedly and I place it down in surprise.

“See?” he says, grinning when I leave it tilted at an angle on the counter. “You’re fine.”

My smile begins to fade as the unease tugs at me. The small freedoms feel dangerous, almost indulgent. I try to vent the situation to him. I tell him about Mum, the rituals she demanded, the way they filled every morning and night. ‘The house doesn’t like surprises.’ She would always say.

“At night,” I murmur, “Mum would make me do it all again. Washing, lights, doors, mirrors, beds. Not just chores, but silly things like placing one glass on the bench then moving it after twenty seconds. Counting the creak of the boards seven times. Tapping the walls, tracing the windowsill. Water on, water off. Two minutes cold, one hot. And if I didn’t… the feeling would start. The horrible, crawling, pressing feeling.”

He reaches for my hand, gentle and coaxing. “And now you’re letting it rest, just for today,” he says. “Just this one day.”

I nod, warmed by his presence. The thought of staying feels intoxicating. His fingers brush through my hair, linger along my wrist. His smile, the curve of his mouth, the way he leans in. It makes my chest ache in a way that has nothing to do with panic. I could stay here.

I swallow hard, the words tangling in my throat. “I… I… think…”

He tilts my chin, eyes searching mine. “You don’t have to do anything tonight. I just want you here. With me. Just try.”

My chest tightens as my mind flashes forward, imagining the night. The bed he has, the soft light, the quiet. But also the ceiling that doesn’t creak the right way, the mirrors that won’t fog correctly, the closet doors that won’t line up. The first stirrings of panic take hold.

“You’ll be safe,” he murmurs, brushing his hand over my cheek. “I promise.”

I take a trembling breath and nod. “Okay… I’ll try.”

Even as the words leave me, the creeping tension begins. By late evening, I’m still with him, laughing softly at the movie we watch, holding his hand, leaning against him while the city hums outside. It feels like peace. A false peace.

Then the whispers begin.

Midnight approaches, and the house in my mind awakens. Luke notices my discomfort, takes both my hands in his. “You got this.”

I shake my head, panic tightening my chest. The pressure starts to mount. “I… I can’t. Not tonight. I’ll feel it.”

He hesitates, then leans closer, soft but insistent. “Babe, it’s ok. Stay with me. I’m here to help.”

I bite my lip, trembling. Desire, trust, fear—each one pulling in opposite directions. The whisper grows into a growl, my mother’s voice crawling through my head. I can almost feel it on my skin. The breaths come, I can’t breathe all of a sudden. 

I stand abruptly. “I… I have to go.”

Luke’s expression softens, concern and confusion in his eyes. “Okay. Let me drive you at least.”

“No!” I shout. The feeling in my head grows louder, angrier. My heart flexes into a contortion I didn’t think possible, making the room spin. I’ve never felt something like it before in my life. Mum was right. I had to go home.

I leave without another word. Luke’s cries of worry follow me out as I run.

The journey home is frantic. Every step pounds in rhythm with the growing panic. I count them to stay focused. I can’t see the ground properly, but I make out the shapes of the concrete squares. Two steps in each, then to the next. I count the parked cars as I pass, starting again if I see a white one.

No matter what I do, the house screams in my mind. I have to be home.

I burst through the door, the familiar smells and quiet overwhelming me. It feels like stepping back into someone else’s skin , I had to make it right.
I start immediately to the bedroom.

I knock on the wall three times.
I strip the bed and remake it. Corners perfect. Pillows just touching. Sheets straight.
Close window. Close door.
Closet doors opened and shut in precise repetition.
Curtains drawn, then half, then fully.
Lights flicked on, off, on, off.
Finger along the sill.
Hallway.
Count the floorboards creaks. Seven, always seven.
Bathroom.
Fog mirror, draw circle. 
The water, two minutes cold, one hot. 
Mirror wiped in careful circles until the streaks fade evenly.
Kitchen.
Boil the kettle. No bubbles or steam.
Tap water running cold, hot, cold.
Everything in its place, exactly how it should be.

The horrible feeling creeps up, inch by inch. It starts in my stomach, low and sour, climbing toward my throat. Mum’s voice murmurs insistently in my head, that same hushed, rhythmic chant she used to whisper when I was little.
Do it. Do it now.

In the bedroom, as I prep for bed, I glance at the clock. It’s almost midnight. The feeling should be fading by now, but it isn’t. It’s getting worse.

What did I forget?

The bed. The window. The wall. The closet. The mirror.
The kitchen.

The cup. It’s still in the sink.

I run downstairs, skipping the creaking floorboards. The house feels as if it’s to swallow me. Every corner seems to lean closer, every shadow pulsing with that same insistent breath.

I pull the cup from the sink and place it on the counter.
Twenty seconds. That’s all.

My vision blurs. My chest tightens. The air feels thick and syrupy. Something’s pressing behind my eyes, something that wants out. My whole body vibrates with alien energy.

Hoping the seconds are correct, I slide the cup into its final resting place for the night.

Silence rushes in like a wave.
The clock strikes midnight.

And then, the groan.
That deep, familiar creak and pop from the roof, long and satisfied.

The pressure eases. The dread fades. I make the ponderous steps up the stairs before sinking into my bed, exhausted but safe. For tonight, the house is calm.

I didn’t even notice my phone buzzing in my bag. Missed calls. Messages. His words spilling across the screen, apologies if he’d seemed too forward, just wanting me to be okay.

I passed out before I could reply.

***

Morning comes in soft light, washing over the house. I lie still for a moment, listening. No creaks. No groans from the walls. The house is calm, obedient once again.

I swing my legs over the side of the bed and start the day the only way I can.
Knock the wall three times.
Bed corners straightened, sheets smoothed. Pillows just touching.
Window open. Door open.
Closet doors opened and shut in precise repetition.
Lights on and off in the sequence.
Curtains drawn, then half, then fully. Aligning perfectly.
Finger along the sill.
Count the floorboards creaks, seven, always seven.
Fog the mirror, circle. 
Run a shower, two cold, one hot.
Wipe the mirror.

The feeling ebbs slowly, inch by inch, until the rhythm of the ritual quiets the whispers in my mind. 

I finish in the kitchen with the final steps as I place the damned cup into the sink and wait for the groan.

Mum’s whispers fade, dissolving into the morning hum. The house is satisfied. I can finally breathe.

Even then, I still feel as if I’ve forgotten something, a thread left hanging. A strange feeling for something I’ve done for decades, ever since I was a girl. That fear lingers, crawling along the edges of my mind like frost. I hold onto my determination. For now, that is enough.

I glance at my phone, at the missed calls and concerned messages. I type back carefully: I’m fine. Thank you.

I stay home today, working on my hobbies and watching mindless videos online. The world feels too much for me today. I send a brief apology to Luke. He understands, wholeheartedly.

By the end of the day, I am mentally wrecked, bracing myself for tomorrow and what work will demand. I prepare to perform my night routines when suddenly a knock comes from the door.

Luke stands there, a box of chocolates in hand, smiling softly. “Mind if I come in?”

He apologises, and I reassure him it’s not him at all. In fact, I wanted what he was thinking. “It’s fine,” I say. “It’s something I’m used to. Hopefully, I’ll fall out of fashion with it eventually.”

“If you really need to leave you can do so at any time, I won’t try to hold you back.”

I smile faintly, taking the chocolates from him. “No it’s fine, it’s all just… new to me.”

“I understand.” he says, his voice softening. “You rushed out so fast last night. I just… wanted to make sure you’re okay.”

He looks around the living room as if expecting to see ghosts that keep me tethered here. His eyes linger on the folded blankets, the lined-up coasters, the neat symmetry of the curtains. I can feel his quiet curiosity brushing against the edges of my order.

“It’s very…” he starts, then hesitates.

“Particular?” I offer, setting the chocolates down.

He laughs nervously. “I was going to say ‘neat’. But yeah… Particular fits.”

The silence after his laugh feels heavy, but not unpleasant. He sits on the couch and I join him, close enough that I can smell the faint scent of cologne and coffee clinging to him. His warmth feels almost dangerous.

“I hate seeing you like this,” he says quietly. “So… scared of being outside this place.”

“I’m not scared,” I reply. “I just. I can’t ignore it. The house needs balance. It’s always been that way.”

He watches me, searching my face for something. “And what if, just once, you didn’t do it? What if nothing happens?”

The air seems to thicken. My pulse kicks up.
“Luke,” I whisper, “Please don’t.”

He reaches for my hand, thumb brushing against my wrist. “I’m not trying to push. I just don’t want you to live in fear of…” He glances around. “…this.”

I pull my hand away, gently. “It’s not fear. It’s just how I do things.”

He exhales, frustrated but tender. “You sound like a caretaker for something that doesn’t exist.”

I smile faintly, though it doesn’t reach my eyes. “It’s fine if you don’t understand. Honestly, I’m so use to it, that it doesn’t bother me.”

The look on his face shifts, unease and annoyance. “No it definitely bothers you.”

I shake my head in disbelief. “Sorry?”

“Wait no, that came out wrong.” He adjusted himself and faced me. “I just feel that… well it doesn’t sound like OCD, it’s just a thing with this house.”

I continue to stare at him, uncomfortable.

“Maybe because of your mum.”

I feel the air in the room shift, colder. He said it so plainly. Like he had peeled something open.

“My mum?” I echo, my voice quiet. “What about her?”

Luke hesitates, reading my expression. “I mean… you said she made you do these things, right? Maybe you’re just… keeping them alive for her.”

He gives a half-smile, trying to soften it, but the words feel sharp in the air. “She’s gone Luke.” I say flatly.

“I know, I just—” He sighs, rubbing his face. “I didn’t mean to sound rude. I just hate that you feel trapped by this.”

“It’s not about her.” The words come out harder than I expect. I lower my gaze, twisting the fabric of my sleeve. “It’s the house.”

He leans forward, “You talk like it’s alive.”

“Sometimes it feels that way,” I murmur. “It listens. It remembers. If I stop… it gets angry.”

There’s a long pause. I can hear the refrigerator hum in the silence between us. “Mum always said. ‘The house doesn’t like surprises.’” I murmur.

Luke reaches for my hand again. I pull away again.

“I want to understand,” he says gently. “I really do. Maybe if I saw it… what you do at night.”

I shake my head immediately. “No. It’s private. It’s not for anyone else.”

“I don’t have to touch anything,” he says quickly. “Just watch. Keep you company. Make sure you’re okay.”

I can feel my chest tightening again, that creeping awareness of the house around us, the walls, the corners, the weight of it listening. But there’s something in his eyes that’s hard to refuse. Warmth. Love.

“And you won’t do anything? You’ll let me do it? No trying to make me change things?”

“Nope, I’m here for you.”

His smile melts me.

“Ok, I’ll show you.”

I lead him up the stairs and through the hallway, my hands trembling slightly. The house feels different tonight as if it’s aware of him in its walls. Watching. The air seems stuffier, like the walls — like myself, are holding their breath.

“It starts here,” I whisper, stopping by the open bedroom door. 

Luke nods, his expression soft, encouraging. “I’ll just watch, promise.”

I take a slow breath and begin. I walk in and stand by the bed.
Knock the wall. Three times.
I strip the bed then remake it.
Bed corners straightened, sheets smoothed, pillows touching perfectly. 
Window and door closed. 
Check the closet. Check it again.
Curtains drawn, then half, then fully.
Finger along the sill.

The motions are steady, automatic. Years of practice distilled into quiet precision.

Luke stays silent. I can feel his eyes tracing every move I make. 
Count the floorboards creaks. Seven, always seven.
When I go to the mirror in the bathroom, he steps closer. I hesitate, the rhythm faltering for just a heartbeat.

“You okay?” he whispers.

“Shhh,” I say, sharper than I mean to. I soften my voice. “Sorry. We have to be quiet. It has to listen.”

He nods again, lips pressed together.

I breathe on the mirror, draw the circle. Since I’m not showering, I use the tap. The water running cold for two, then hot for one. 
Wipe the mirror clean.
The house creaks faintly, as if acknowledging me.

By the time I reach the kitchen, I can feel the tension leaving my body, replaced by that strange, hollow calm.
Luke follows, arms folded, uncertain. “You do this every night?”

“Yes.”
Kettle on but stop before boil.
The tap runs, cold, hot, cold.
I take the cup from the sink, place it on the bench.
Silence fills the room.

“Now I wait 20 seconds then slide the cup to its final position. And… voila.”

He nods. I don’t know what I see in his face. I try to laugh it off, heat rising to mine. “God, this is so embarrassing, you probably think I’m a freak or something.”

“No! No. Of course not.”

He steps behind me, wrapping his arms around tight. His warmth presses against me; I sigh, just a little. “You have your quirks. That’s fine.” He murmurs.

“Thank you.” I whisper.

I reach for the cup, but his voice cuts in, gentle, curious. “What if you didn’t do that?”

I pause, frowning. “It’s not done yet. It has to go there.” I point to the exact spot. “I need to hear the creak of approval.”

“The creak?”

“Yea the roof creaks after I place the cup there.”

I go to move it, but his hands hold me still. “Listen,” he says. “Just… listen.”

He points upward. A long, groaning sound ripples through the ceiling. The familiar voice of the house.
My stomach drops. “No, that’s wrong. It hasn’t been placed yet.”

“Babe,” he says softly, smiling. “It’s what old houses do.”

He crosses to the sink and turns on the tap. Lets it run, then shuts it off. Watching him break the rhythm feels like watching an alter be defiled. My chest tightens.

“Wait for it,” he says, checking his watch.

At the twenty-second mark, the house groans again, another low creak from above.
He smiles, triumphant. “See? I noticed your rituals involved water and taps. Those sounds? They’re just pipes filling and draining. That’s all.”

I want to believe him. I really do.
For the first time in years, someone is here, in this house, and the walls haven’t swallowed me whole. His warmth fills the space that’s always felt so cold. Maybe I could believe him.

“You’re right,” I nod, “It’s just old pipes.”

Luke exhales, relieved, smiling that gentle smile of his. He kisses my forehead. “Exactly. You deserve peace.”

Peace. The word feels strange.

We go upstairs together. The house groans faintly as we climb, like it’s shifting in its sleep. I tell myself it’s just the wood settling, that it doesn’t mean anything. I don’t count the steps. I keep my eyes on Luke, on the way he turns back every few seconds to make sure I’m still there.

In the bedroom, I hesitate at the door. The familiar pull of habit tugs at my chest. A need to fix the corners of the bed, to draw the curtains in perfect halves. Even though I’ve done it, it lingers still. Luke’s hand finds mine, and the impulse falters.

“Hey,” he murmurs. “Just breathe.”

I do. For once, I breathe deeply and let it all out.

We sit on the bed, close enough that I can feel the heat of his body next to mine. The quiet stretches between us, gentle and human. When he reaches up to tuck a strand of hair behind my ear, my breath catches. His hand lingers on my cheek, tentative, as though afraid to break something fragile.

“It’s okay,” I whisper, unsure if I’m saying it to him or myself.

When he kisses me, it’s slow — hesitant at first, like testing an old lock that hasn’t been turned in years. Then warmer. His hands trace down my back, grounding me, reminding me I’m still flesh and blood, not a servant of walls and shadows.

The house creaks once but I ignore it. I close my eyes and let myself exist in this fragile, borrowed peace.

We move together like it’s something sacred. His breath against my neck, my hands clutching at him as if he’s the only thing anchoring me to the world. It’s quiet, tender, reverent. A soft rebellion against everything that’s kept me chained here.

When it’s over, he holds me close. The warmth between us hums like a heartbeat. I rest my head on his chest, listening.

I try to stay in that moment.

To believe that this warmth, this closeness, can drown out everything else. That maybe I can finally belong to someone instead of it.

But underneath the sheets, my pulse won’t slow. The walls feel too close. The air hums, faintly. Not quite a sound, more like a vibration running through the bones of the house.

I bury my face in Luke’s shoulder, forcing myself to ignore it. To ignore the itch in my palms that wants to knock three times. To ignore the whisper that starts behind the walls, low and muffled, a voice I’ve spent years obeying.

I hold him tighter, pretend I don’t feel it.

The night stretches on, heavy and warm. And when the pull of sleep finally begins to drags me under, that feeling doesn’t fade.
It builds.
Crawling beneath my skin.
Pooling in my chest.
A pressure I can’t release.

Then, from somewhere deep within the house, a clock chimes.

Midnight.

The pressure grows beneath my skin, curling through my chest and up into my head. I try to focus on Luke’s warmth, the heartbeat beneath my ear. I tell myself it’s nothing, that I’m fine. I repeat it like a mantra.

Then… I woke up.

The room is quiet. The sun bares through the open curtains. My body feels tight, alien — bruised and exhausted, like I’ve been fighting in my sleep. My arms ache. My fingers throb. The faint smell of copper tingles my nose.

I look down. My arms are bruised, three nails torn clean off, blood covering my thumbs drips onto the sheets. Panic floods me as crimson stains bloom beneath me. I crawl forward, stomach churning, the metallic scent thickening with every inch. I reach the edge of the bed and see him on the floor.

Luke.

His body lies in impossible angles. His arms are shattered, bent in ways they shouldn’t bend. His neck is twisted, grotesque — like it had been gripped by some unrelenting force. His face is a mask of horror, eyes gouged clean, sockets glistening with dark red pulp. The blood is still warm, congealing. Tiny rivulets trail from the bed, soaking into the floorboards. The coppery scent is thick enough to taste.

I crawl backwards in the bed, gagging. My stomach lurches violently. My hands shake uncontrollably as I touch my own arms, feeling the sharp pain, the proof of my own hands, my own body. My mind spins. How could I? I don’t remember.

My chest tightens again. I scream.

“Why!?” My voice cracks, echoing off the walls. “Why!?”

The tears come fast, hot and bitter, streaming down my cheeks. My fingers clutch at the sheets, the mattress. The sobs shake me to the bone.

My voice echoes through the house — and the house answers.

Knock.

I freeze, heart hammering.

Knock.

I listen.

Knock.

I glance behind me, where I always start. I wait for another impact, even though I already know it won’t come.

I stumble from the bed, to his ruined body, my hands shaking as I try to gather myself. His blood sticks to my skin, the warmth of it grounding me in the horror of what I’ve done, what’s been done. The smell is unbearable, metallic and sweet, clinging to the air, to me.

I take the sheets from the bed and drape them over him, my hands trembling so violently I barely manage it. My knees buckle and I slump to the floor, staring at the ceiling, the walls, the shadows. My chest heaves. My mind screams.

The house doesn’t like surprises.

I slowly pull myself from the floor and reach the back wall, still wracked with sobs, my tears mixing with the blood on my face.

I drag myself out of bed and tap the wall above me. Three times. The plaster is cold under my knuckles, and the echo hums like the house is listening. Mum used to say it didn’t like surprises.

Slippers on. Bed made, corners tight, sheets smooth. Pillows must touch at the corners.
Window open. Door open.
Closet check. Check again. Open, shut, pause. Open, shut. Move on.

I sigh as I approach the door.
Light on. Off. On. Off.
Then to the window again.
Curtains pulled halfway, then fully, then half again. The folds have to line up.
I run my finger along the sill for ten seconds. Dust gathers beneath my nail. I wipe it away after counting out loud.
The floorboards creak as I step into the hallway. I count each one. Seven. Always seven.
If I don’t hear the creaks, I start again.

The bathroom mirror waits for me, fogged though the air is cold. I breathe on it and draw a small circle before stepping into the shower for three minutes. Two cold, one hot.
The steam frames my circle in the mirror. I stare at it. My reflection looks tired.
I whisper good morning to her, then wipe the glass clean. The streaks have to fade evenly.

In the kitchen, everything feels quieter.
The hum of the fridge, the soft scrape of the chair against tile. I make tea in the same mug, with the same teaspoon. The water must boil first but stop just before the bubbles, no steam. Then pour. Wait three breaths before adding the milk. The spoon must rest straight across the rim when I’m done stirring.

I set the mug down and walk to the sink. I take the cup from the bench and place it in the sink. It hadn’t been used but it had to be there. 
Now the tap has to run. Cold first, then hot, then cold again. I let it flow as I sip my tea. After ten mouthfuls, I turn off the water and let the quiet fill the room.

The clock ticks in the next room. I count six seconds, then listen for the creak above me. The ceiling always answers with one soft pop, like a sigh.
Only then can I breathe.

Mum used to say the house doesn’t like surprises. She would whisper it every morning, soft enough that I thought she was talking to the walls.

After doing my makeup, I grab my coat, open the front door, and carried her quiet insistence with me.

My phone vibrates. I smile at the movement because I know exactly who it is.

Meet you at the usual place babe?

Absolutely :D

The street feels alive in a way the house never does. Cars hum in the distance, a dog barks somewhere behind a fence, and the sound of my shoes on the pavement feels light. I catch a rhythm in the tapping, I almost want to match it, then shake my head. It passes.

By the time I reach the café, the morning finally feels ordinary. My head isn’t counting. The folds, the water, the creaks. They all stay behind the door. I let myself smile at the reflection in the glass, letting the thoughts of Luke perk me up.

He’s already there, near the window, that lopsided grin he can’t hide. “Hey,” he says, standing to kiss my cheek. “You look good.”

“Do I?” I smile back. “You seem…”

“Tired? Late night.” He stifles a yawn. “Work stuff.”

We sit, the usual spot. His black coffee arrives while I get my latte. The barista knows our order now and makes it without our input. She winks at the both of us playfully as Luke hands her cash.

“How’s the house?” Luke asks once we’ve settled. “Gotten any better since Mum?”

I stir my drink slowly. “The same still.” I sigh. A pause. A small, private memory surfaces. Mum standing by the kettle, turning it off before it fully boils. I shake it away.

He reaches over, hand covering mine. “Ok, I won’t talk about her. What about you? Are you ok?”

“Yeah,” I say. Letting the feeling pass through me, fleeting. “It’s… hard. Definitely quieter now.”

An employee taps from the counter making me catch my breath for a second. One, two, three. I let it go. Luke’s hand is still there.

“I just follow my routines. Feels like she’s still there sometimes,” I say quietly.

“Wait… as in like a morning routine?” His brow furrows, curiosity mixed with concern.

“Yeah.” I trace the rim of my mug, letting the warmth steady me. “She made me do it. I’ve always done it. I… I think it’s OCD.”

Luke blinks, surprised. “You think?”

I nod, shrugging. “Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. That’s what it feels like to me. Counting, aligning, checking… it’s all too familiar.”

He leans back, silent for a moment, letting my words sink in. “So it’s not just, like, making your bed then having your toast?”

I shake my head, almost embarrassed. “Not really. It’s a lot more than that.” I glance at him, letting the pause speak for me.

I look at the lovely man in front of me, noticing the way he watches me, the way his eyes soften but his mind is clearly racing. I still struggle to fathom life without him, even though it’s only been a few months. His mouth begins to move again.

“Ok… I’ve never noticed it out here. Not at work, or here,” Luke says, brow furrowed.

“No,” I reply, stirring my latte. “It’s at home. Only at home.”

“I don’t understand. Is it just the morning?”

I shake my head, feeling the memory grip me. “Night as well. I… I haven’t slept at another person’s house in… well, I don’t know how long. One time, I snuck out and tried to stay at a friend’s place, but by the time I got there, I had to go home. I didn’t do the thing.”

He studies me quietly, his hand still over mine. “The thing?”

“The routines. The counting, the aligning… it’s not optional. If I don’t do it, I… I feel wrong. I can’t sleep, I can’t eat. I have to do it.” I look down at my mug, tracing the rim. “That’s why you only see me during the day. I have to do it.”

Luke leans back, his chair creaking as it rocks gently. My leg bounces steadily, betraying the tension I try to hide. “You know… if you want, you could stay at my place tonight.” He offers.

My heart skips. I look up at him, surprised. “Um… I don’t know. I just said that…”

His hand steadies my vibrating thigh, and I flutter.

“Don’t worry. I’ll help you. Make sure you’re safe. You don’t have to go home and do the things if you don’t want to.” His other hand tightens over mine, gentle but grounding.

A warmth spreads through me, almost making me forget the counting, the aligning, the rituals. I can’t help the little smile that spreads across my face. “You’d do that?”

“Of course,” he says softly. “I just want you to feel normal for once. No routines, no panic, no rules.”

I bite my lip, trying to steady my racing heart. The thought of being somewhere else, with him, even just for one night, makes me swoon inside. Almost like I could… almost like I could belong somewhere else.

Then his tone shifts, hesitant but determined. “Maybe… after tonight, you could try skipping one small thing. Just one. See how it feels.”

I freeze. The idea stabs into me like a knife. My fingers tighten around the mug. “Skip… something?”

“Yeah,” he says, gentle, coaxing. “Nothing crazy. Just… break the pattern, even a little. You might see it’s not as bad as it feels.”

I swallow hard. My chest tightens. My mind flashes through countless mornings and nights—the ceiling creaks, the mirror, the doors, the lights. The house would be unattended. It needs me.

Then I glance at him again, at the concern in his eyes, the soft curve of his mouth, and my chest softens. I want to trust him. I want to try, just this once.

The day passes almost too quickly. With Luke, time feels soft and forgiving. I can sit without counting, touch without aligning, breathe without checking. But it seems over before I can truly enjoy it, the thought of going home lingering in the back of my mind.

As we arrive at his apartment, I take in its colours, its smell and style. I smile again in genuine happiness seeing someone else’s residence. He hands me a spoon unexpectedly and I place it down in surprise.

“See?” he says, grinning when I leave it tilted at an angle on the counter. “You’re fine.”

My smile begins to fade as the unease tugs at me. The small freedoms feel dangerous, almost indulgent. I try to vent the situation to him. I tell him about Mum, the rituals she demanded, the way they filled every morning and night. ‘The house doesn’t like surprises.’ She would always say.

“At night,” I murmur, “Mum would make me do it all again. Washing, lights, doors, mirrors, beds. Not just chores, but silly things like placing one glass on the bench then moving it after twenty seconds. Counting the creak of the boards seven times. Tapping the walls, tracing the windowsill. Water on, water off. Two minutes cold, one hot. And if I didn’t… the feeling would start. The horrible, crawling, pressing feeling.”

He reaches for my hand, gentle and coaxing. “And now you’re letting it rest, just for today,” he says. “Just this one day.”

I nod, warmed by his presence. The thought of staying feels intoxicating. His fingers brush through my hair, linger along my wrist. His smile, the curve of his mouth, the way he leans in. It makes my chest ache in a way that has nothing to do with panic. I could stay here.

I swallow hard, the words tangling in my throat. “I… I… think…”

He tilts my chin, eyes searching mine. “You don’t have to do anything tonight. I just want you here. With me. Just try.”

My chest tightens as my mind flashes forward, imagining the night. The bed he has, the soft light, the quiet. But also the ceiling that doesn’t creak the right way, the mirrors that won’t fog correctly, the closet doors that won’t line up. The first stirrings of panic take hold.

“You’ll be safe,” he murmurs, brushing his hand over my cheek. “I promise.”

I take a trembling breath and nod. “Okay… I’ll try.”

Even as the words leave me, the creeping tension begins. By late evening, I’m still with him, laughing softly at the movie we watch, holding his hand, leaning against him while the city hums outside. It feels like peace. A false peace.

Then the whispers begin.

Midnight approaches, and the house in my mind awakens. Luke notices my discomfort, takes both my hands in his. “You got this.”

I shake my head, panic tightening my chest. The pressure starts to mount. “I… I can’t. Not tonight. I’ll feel it.”

He hesitates, then leans closer, soft but insistent. “Babe, it’s ok. Stay with me. I’m here to help.”

I bite my lip, trembling. Desire, trust, fear—each one pulling in opposite directions. The whisper grows into a growl, my mother’s voice crawling through my head. I can almost feel it on my skin. The breaths come, I can’t breathe all of a sudden. 

I stand abruptly. “I… I have to go.”

Luke’s expression softens, concern and confusion in his eyes. “Okay. Let me drive you at least.”

“No!” I shout. The feeling in my head grows louder, angrier. My heart flexes into a contortion I didn’t think possible, making the room spin. I’ve never felt something like it before in my life. Mum was right. I had to go home.

I leave without another word. Luke’s cries of worry follow me out as I run.

The journey home is frantic. Every step pounds in rhythm with the growing panic. I count them to stay focused. I can’t see the ground properly, but I make out the shapes of the concrete squares. Two steps in each, then to the next. I count the parked cars as I pass, starting again if I see a white one.

No matter what I do, the house screams in my mind. I have to be home.

I burst through the door, the familiar smells and quiet overwhelming me. It feels like stepping back into someone else’s skin , I had to make it right.
I start immediately to the bedroom.

I knock on the wall three times.
I strip the bed and remake it. Corners perfect. Pillows just touching. Sheets straight.
Close window. Close door.
Closet doors opened and shut in precise repetition.
Curtains drawn, then half, then fully.
Lights flicked on, off, on, off.
Finger along the sill.
Hallway.
Count the floorboards creaks. Seven, always seven.
Bathroom.
Fog mirror, draw circle. 
The water, two minutes cold, one hot. 
Mirror wiped in careful circles until the streaks fade evenly.
Kitchen.
Boil the kettle. No bubbles or steam.
Tap water running cold, hot, cold.
Everything in its place, exactly how it should be.

The horrible feeling creeps up, inch by inch. It starts in my stomach, low and sour, climbing toward my throat. Mum’s voice murmurs insistently in my head, that same hushed, rhythmic chant she used to whisper when I was little.
Do it. Do it now.

In the bedroom, as I prep for bed, I glance at the clock. It’s almost midnight. The feeling should be fading by now, but it isn’t. It’s getting worse.

What did I forget?

The bed. The window. The wall. The closet. The mirror.
The kitchen.

The cup. It’s still in the sink.

I run downstairs, skipping the creaking floorboards. The house feels as if it’s to swallow me. Every corner seems to lean closer, every shadow pulsing with that same insistent breath.

I pull the cup from the sink and place it on the counter.
Twenty seconds. That’s all.

My vision blurs. My chest tightens. The air feels thick and syrupy. Something’s pressing behind my eyes, something that wants out. My whole body vibrates with alien energy.

Hoping the seconds are correct, I slide the cup into its final resting place for the night.

Silence rushes in like a wave.
The clock strikes midnight.

And then, the groan.
That deep, familiar creak and pop from the roof, long and satisfied.

The pressure eases. The dread fades. I make the ponderous steps up the stairs before sinking into my bed, exhausted but safe. For tonight, the house is calm.

I didn’t even notice my phone buzzing in my bag. Missed calls. Messages. His words spilling across the screen, apologies if he’d seemed too forward, just wanting me to be okay.

I passed out before I could reply.

***

Morning comes in soft light, washing over the house. I lie still for a moment, listening. No creaks. No groans from the walls. The house is calm, obedient once again.

I swing my legs over the side of the bed and start the day the only way I can.
Knock the wall three times.
Bed corners straightened, sheets smoothed. Pillows just touching.
Window open. Door open.
Closet doors opened and shut in precise repetition.
Lights on and off in the sequence.
Curtains drawn, then half, then fully. Aligning perfectly.
Finger along the sill.
Count the floorboards creaks, seven, always seven.
Fog the mirror, circle. 
Run a shower, two cold, one hot.
Wipe the mirror.

The feeling ebbs slowly, inch by inch, until the rhythm of the ritual quiets the whispers in my mind. 

I finish in the kitchen with the final steps as I place the damned cup into the sink and wait for the groan.

Mum’s whispers fade, dissolving into the morning hum. The house is satisfied. I can finally breathe.

Even then, I still feel as if I’ve forgotten something, a thread left hanging. A strange feeling for something I’ve done for decades, ever since I was a girl. That fear lingers, crawling along the edges of my mind like frost. I hold onto my determination. For now, that is enough.

I glance at my phone, at the missed calls and concerned messages. I type back carefully: I’m fine. Thank you.

I stay home today, working on my hobbies and watching mindless videos online. The world feels too much for me today. I send a brief apology to Luke. He understands, wholeheartedly.

By the end of the day, I am mentally wrecked, bracing myself for tomorrow and what work will demand. I prepare to perform my night routines when suddenly a knock comes from the door.

Luke stands there, a box of chocolates in hand, smiling softly. “Mind if I come in?”

He apologises, and I reassure him it’s not him at all. In fact, I wanted what he was thinking. “It’s fine,” I say. “It’s something I’m used to. Hopefully, I’ll fall out of fashion with it eventually.”

“If you really need to leave you can do so at any time, I won’t try to hold you back.”

I smile faintly, taking the chocolates from him. “No it’s fine, it’s all just… new to me.”

“I understand.” he says, his voice softening. “You rushed out so fast last night. I just… wanted to make sure you’re okay.”

He looks around the living room as if expecting to see ghosts that keep me tethered here. His eyes linger on the folded blankets, the lined-up coasters, the neat symmetry of the curtains. I can feel his quiet curiosity brushing against the edges of my order.

“It’s very…” he starts, then hesitates.

“Particular?” I offer, setting the chocolates down.

He laughs nervously. “I was going to say ‘neat’. But yeah… Particular fits.”

The silence after his laugh feels heavy, but not unpleasant. He sits on the couch and I join him, close enough that I can smell the faint scent of cologne and coffee clinging to him. His warmth feels almost dangerous.

“I hate seeing you like this,” he says quietly. “So… scared of being outside this place.”

“I’m not scared,” I reply. “I just. I can’t ignore it. The house needs balance. It’s always been that way.”

He watches me, searching my face for something. “And what if, just once, you didn’t do it? What if nothing happens?”

The air seems to thicken. My pulse kicks up.
“Luke,” I whisper, “Please don’t.”

He reaches for my hand, thumb brushing against my wrist. “I’m not trying to push. I just don’t want you to live in fear of…” He glances around. “…this.”

I pull my hand away, gently. “It’s not fear. It’s just how I do things.”

He exhales, frustrated but tender. “You sound like a caretaker for something that doesn’t exist.”

I smile faintly, though it doesn’t reach my eyes. “It’s fine if you don’t understand. Honestly, I’m so use to it, that it doesn’t bother me.”

The look on his face shifts, unease and annoyance. “No it definitely bothers you.”

I shake my head in disbelief. “Sorry?”

“Wait no, that came out wrong.” He adjusted himself and faced me. “I just feel that… well it doesn’t sound like OCD, it’s just a thing with this house.”

I continue to stare at him, uncomfortable.

“Maybe because of your mum.”

I feel the air in the room shift, colder. He said it so plainly. Like he had peeled something open.

“My mum?” I echo, my voice quiet. “What about her?”

Luke hesitates, reading my expression. “I mean… you said she made you do these things, right? Maybe you’re just… keeping them alive for her.”

He gives a half-smile, trying to soften it, but the words feel sharp in the air. “She’s gone Luke.” I say flatly.

“I know, I just—” He sighs, rubbing his face. “I didn’t mean to sound rude. I just hate that you feel trapped by this.”

“It’s not about her.” The words come out harder than I expect. I lower my gaze, twisting the fabric of my sleeve. “It’s the house.”

He leans forward, “You talk like it’s alive.”

“Sometimes it feels that way,” I murmur. “It listens. It remembers. If I stop… it gets angry.”

There’s a long pause. I can hear the refrigerator hum in the silence between us. “Mum always said. ‘The house doesn’t like surprises.’” I murmur.

Luke reaches for my hand again. I pull away again.

“I want to understand,” he says gently. “I really do. Maybe if I saw it… what you do at night.”

I shake my head immediately. “No. It’s private. It’s not for anyone else.”

“I don’t have to touch anything,” he says quickly. “Just watch. Keep you company. Make sure you’re okay.”

I can feel my chest tightening again, that creeping awareness of the house around us, the walls, the corners, the weight of it listening. But there’s something in his eyes that’s hard to refuse. Warmth. Love.

“And you won’t do anything? You’ll let me do it? No trying to make me change things?”

“Nope, I’m here for you.”

His smile melts me.

“Ok, I’ll show you.”

I lead him up the stairs and through the hallway, my hands trembling slightly. The house feels different tonight as if it’s aware of him in its walls. Watching. The air seems stuffier, like the walls — like myself, are holding their breath.

“It starts here,” I whisper, stopping by the open bedroom door. 

Luke nods, his expression soft, encouraging. “I’ll just watch, promise.”

I take a slow breath and begin. I walk in and stand by the bed.
Knock the wall. Three times.
I strip the bed then remake it.
Bed corners straightened, sheets smoothed, pillows touching perfectly. 
Window and door closed. 
Check the closet. Check it again.
Curtains drawn, then half, then fully.
Finger along the sill.

The motions are steady, automatic. Years of practice distilled into quiet precision.

Luke stays silent. I can feel his eyes tracing every move I make. 
Count the floorboards creaks. Seven, always seven.
When I go to the mirror in the bathroom, he steps closer. I hesitate, the rhythm faltering for just a heartbeat.

“You okay?” he whispers.

“Shhh,” I say, sharper than I mean to. I soften my voice. “Sorry. We have to be quiet. It has to listen.”

He nods again, lips pressed together.

I breathe on the mirror, draw the circle. Since I’m not showering, I use the tap. The water running cold for two, then hot for one. 
Wipe the mirror clean.
The house creaks faintly, as if acknowledging me.

By the time I reach the kitchen, I can feel the tension leaving my body, replaced by that strange, hollow calm.
Luke follows, arms folded, uncertain. “You do this every night?”

“Yes.”
Kettle on but stop before boil.
The tap runs, cold, hot, cold.
I take the cup from the sink, place it on the bench.
Silence fills the room.

“Now I wait 20 seconds then slide the cup to its final position. And… voila.”

He nods. I don’t know what I see in his face. I try to laugh it off, heat rising to mine. “God, this is so embarrassing, you probably think I’m a freak or something.”

“No! No. Of course not.”

He steps behind me, wrapping his arms around tight. His warmth presses against me; I sigh, just a little. “You have your quirks. That’s fine.” He murmurs.

“Thank you.” I whisper.

I reach for the cup, but his voice cuts in, gentle, curious. “What if you didn’t do that?”

I pause, frowning. “It’s not done yet. It has to go there.” I point to the exact spot. “I need to hear the creak of approval.”

“The creak?”

“Yea the roof creaks after I place the cup there.”

I go to move it, but his hands hold me still. “Listen,” he says. “Just… listen.”

He points upward. A long, groaning sound ripples through the ceiling. The familiar voice of the house.
My stomach drops. “No, that’s wrong. It hasn’t been placed yet.”

“Babe,” he says softly, smiling. “It’s what old houses do.”

He crosses to the sink and turns on the tap. Lets it run, then shuts it off. Watching him break the rhythm feels like watching an alter be defiled. My chest tightens.

“Wait for it,” he says, checking his watch.

At the twenty-second mark, the house groans again, another low creak from above.
He smiles, triumphant. “See? I noticed your rituals involved water and taps. Those sounds? They’re just pipes filling and draining. That’s all.”

I want to believe him. I really do.
For the first time in years, someone is here, in this house, and the walls haven’t swallowed me whole. His warmth fills the space that’s always felt so cold. Maybe I could believe him.

“You’re right,” I nod, “It’s just old pipes.”

Luke exhales, relieved, smiling that gentle smile of his. He kisses my forehead. “Exactly. You deserve peace.”

Peace. The word feels strange.

We go upstairs together. The house groans faintly as we climb, like it’s shifting in its sleep. I tell myself it’s just the wood settling, that it doesn’t mean anything. I don’t count the steps. I keep my eyes on Luke, on the way he turns back every few seconds to make sure I’m still there.

In the bedroom, I hesitate at the door. The familiar pull of habit tugs at my chest. A need to fix the corners of the bed, to draw the curtains in perfect halves. Even though I’ve done it, it lingers still. Luke’s hand finds mine, and the impulse falters.

“Hey,” he murmurs. “Just breathe.”

I do. For once, I breathe deeply and let it all out.

We sit on the bed, close enough that I can feel the heat of his body next to mine. The quiet stretches between us, gentle and human. When he reaches up to tuck a strand of hair behind my ear, my breath catches. His hand lingers on my cheek, tentative, as though afraid to break something fragile.

“It’s okay,” I whisper, unsure if I’m saying it to him or myself.

When he kisses me, it’s slow — hesitant at first, like testing an old lock that hasn’t been turned in years. Then warmer. His hands trace down my back, grounding me, reminding me I’m still flesh and blood, not a servant of walls and shadows.

The house creaks once but I ignore it. I close my eyes and let myself exist in this fragile, borrowed peace.

We move together like it’s something sacred. His breath against my neck, my hands clutching at him as if he’s the only thing anchoring me to the world. It’s quiet, tender, reverent. A soft rebellion against everything that’s kept me chained here.

When it’s over, he holds me close. The warmth between us hums like a heartbeat. I rest my head on his chest, listening.

I try to stay in that moment.

To believe that this warmth, this closeness, can drown out everything else. That maybe I can finally belong to someone instead of it.

But underneath the sheets, my pulse won’t slow. The walls feel too close. The air hums, faintly. Not quite a sound, more like a vibration running through the bones of the house.

I bury my face in Luke’s shoulder, forcing myself to ignore it. To ignore the itch in my palms that wants to knock three times. To ignore the whisper that starts behind the walls, low and muffled, a voice I’ve spent years obeying.

I hold him tighter, pretend I don’t feel it.

The night stretches on, heavy and warm. And when the pull of sleep finally begins to drags me under, that feeling doesn’t fade.
It builds.
Crawling beneath my skin.
Pooling in my chest.
A pressure I can’t release.

Then, from somewhere deep within the house, a clock chimes.

Midnight.

The pressure grows beneath my skin, curling through my chest and up into my head. I try to focus on Luke’s warmth, the heartbeat beneath my ear. I tell myself it’s nothing, that I’m fine. I repeat it like a mantra.

Then… I woke up.

The room is quiet. The sun bares through the open curtains. My body feels tight, alien — bruised and exhausted, like I’ve been fighting in my sleep. My arms ache. My fingers throb. The faint smell of copper tingles my nose.

I look down. My arms are bruised, three nails torn clean off, blood covering my thumbs drips onto the sheets. Panic floods me as crimson stains bloom beneath me. I crawl forward, stomach churning, the metallic scent thickening with every inch. I reach the edge of the bed and see him on the floor.

Luke.

His body lies in impossible angles. His arms are shattered, bent in ways they shouldn’t bend. His neck is twisted, grotesque — like it had been gripped by some unrelenting force. His face is a mask of horror, eyes gouged clean, sockets glistening with dark red pulp. The blood is still warm, congealing. Tiny rivulets trail from the bed, soaking into the floorboards. The coppery scent is thick enough to taste.

I crawl backwards in the bed, gagging. My stomach lurches violently. My hands shake uncontrollably as I touch my own arms, feeling the sharp pain, the proof of my own hands, my own body. My mind spins. How could I? I don’t remember.

My chest tightens again. I scream.

“Why!?” My voice cracks, echoing off the walls. “Why!?”

The tears come fast, hot and bitter, streaming down my cheeks. My fingers clutch at the sheets, the mattress. The sobs shake me to the bone.

My voice echoes through the house — and the house answers.

Knock.

I freeze, heart hammering.

Knock.

I listen.

Knock.

I glance behind me, where I always start. I wait for another impact, even though I already know it won’t come.

I stumble from the bed, to his ruined body, my hands shaking as I try to gather myself. His blood sticks to my skin, the warmth of it grounding me in the horror of what I’ve done, what’s been done. The smell is unbearable, metallic and sweet, clinging to the air, to me.

I take the sheets from the bed and drape them over him, my hands trembling so violently I barely manage it. My knees buckle and I slump to the floor, staring at the ceiling, the walls, the shadows. My chest heaves. My mind screams.

The house doesn’t like surprises.

I slowly pull myself from the floor and reach the back wall, still wracked with sobs, my tears mixing with the blood on my face.

I knock. Three times.",6,1760883911.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I’m in my mid 40s, and a couple of years ago, I started feeling like crap, low energy, workouts taking forever to recover from, and just that general “aging” vibe that sneaks up on you.

My skin was looking rough, sleep was hit or miss, and I just didn’t feel like myself. After a ton of research and a long talk with my doctor (seriously, don’t skip this step), I decided to give HGH a shot about a year ago.

Man, I wish I’d done it sooner. It’s not like I turned into Superman overnight, but the changes have been real. I’ve got way more energy now that I’m not dragging through the day or chugging coffee just to stay awake.

Workouts are so much better too. I lift four or five times a week, and recovery used to be a slog. Now, I’m back at it faster, with less soreness, and I’ve even packed on some lean muscle without really switching up my diet. My skin looks tighter, almost like I’ve shaved a few years off, and sleep? Deep, solid, wake up feeling great sleep. Even my mood’s better, and yeah, my partner’s noticed a boost in the bedroom department too, if you catch my drift.

I started with a low dose, around 2 to 3 IU a day, and I get regular bloodwork to keep things in check. Had some mild joint aches early on, but they went away quick. Everyone’s different, so your mileage may vary, but for me, it’s been a total win.

Now, sourcing legit HGH was a pain at first. I got scammed once with some bunk stuff (pro tip: always test your gear). After a lot of digging, I found [this place](https://omvexor.com/kits4less-hgh/), and I haven’t looked back. Their HGH is as good as the pharma grade stuff, but it’s the cheapest I’ve found because they sell in bulk.

Shipping is fast and discreet (I’m in the US), and their customer service actually gets back to you if you’ve got questions. No sketchy overseas nonsense or worrying about customs.

If you’re thinking about HGH, do your research, talk to a doc, and start slow. It’s been a lifesaver for me.

1oaqxuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1oaqxuo/i_was_fifteen_when_i_first_saw_the_devil/,I was fifteen when I first saw the devil,"I was fifteen years old when I came across the devil, it was a fall night and I had just come out of my hockey practice. The arena lay between two small clusters of trees, small enough that you couldn’t really call them forests, but past those and on the other side of the arena was the forestry centre. This was the place of course where all the older kids liked to go to makeout, smoke weed, spraypaint dicks on the side of the utility building, not that I knew of any of that. By fifteen I was a social outcast, barely able to make friends due to being “too much”, i’d later go on to learn that I was simply neurodivergent and they didn’t know how to handle me. 
So there I am, leaving practice, walking through the first cluster of trees to the second, ready to cut through the forestry centre to make the hour long walk home feel a little less monotonous. The trees were scary but at least they were something new to look at, my walk home usually consisted of a few shoddy businesses and a fire and police station. With the forestry centre you could at least be slightly entertained by the local wildlife. 
Once I leave the first cluster of trees, the sun finally setting, the golden yellow light, that ever elusive golden hour ending, the eerie darkness that wasn’t quite darkness creeping in. This was darkness where you could see in front of you, but just barely, the trees blocking any slight chance to be illuminated by the moonlight. I’m walking, and I hear some twigs snapping in the distance, at this point i’ve reached the second cluster of trees and i’m about to hit the forest proper. I don’t really react, the biggest animal in these woods is a deer and I might be socially awkward and small (my growth spurt won’t come till next year at the earliest) but i’m not a baby. I know that no big bad wolf is gonna get me, unless the prospect of chipmunks slowly nibbling you to death is particularly terrifying. 
As i’m entering the forest I begin to hear more snapping, but deliberate this time, as if something is trying to draw my attention into its direction. I’m ignoring it at first, shrugging it off as a nice buck that maybe one day my stepdad will shoot with his compound bow. That’s when I hear the first growl, it’s inhuman and savage, like a hole being torn in a burlap sack. Panic floods my body, turning my spit dry in my mouth and making my pubescent armpits go crazy with perspiration. 
“Fuck this shit,” I say as I’m turning to leave the forest,
“Maybe the highway pathway home isn’t too bad, hell maybe someone’s hear and they can drive me home.” I laugh to myself, I think in part to hear something other than the uncomfortable silence of the forest. It doesn’t work, fear tightens my stomach into a fierce knot as I try to just keep walking. How fucking far had I gotten into the woods without noticing? I heard another branch break, not a twig but a full on branch. I broke at that moment, my paralysis being overtaken by pure and total terror. I sprinted toward the opening in the foliage, branches whipped at my face, my arms, scratching small shallow cuts, unnoticed. All that mattered was getting out of this labyrinth of fear that I had created for myself. 
As I scanned the right and left, my eye fell upon my first glimpse of whatever it was. At first I thought he was my stepdad, but his features were wrong and he crouched low to the ground, not in a normal, human way. He crouched as if to pounce,
“Hey Joe, come here. Your mom sent me to pick you up!” 
The voice sounded like his voice but something was off about it, as if it was coming through an echo. His eyes glowed, I remember that, they glowed in the early evening light like a cats eye. I froze in place, unable to move and forced myself to squint toward the crouched thing. Before I could comprehend what was happening the creature sprang forward, sliding behind the closest tree to me. I saw the fingers of the thing scrape the tree as I broke for the tree line, hearing the impossibly fast movement of the thing. My stomach lurched as I forced my legs to carry me faster than I ever had before. 
That’s when he caught up to me, grabbing me by the shirt and slammed me into the soft earth, my breath coming out in a whoosh. 
“Why are you running away from me, buddy? You’ve got no reason to be scared.” Said the thing taking the form of my stepdad, his breath was rancid. It smelled like rotting food and stinking dampness, like the dump in the summer. I tried to hide my fear but it was evident on my face, 
“I’m sorry Mike, I didn’t mean to run away. You just spooked me is all.” I replied, nervously laughing. I could feel the things claws digging into my shoulders, holding me down. 
“Can you let me up, Mike?” I said, staring it in the eyes, there was nothing human in them. The thing looked at me coldly, 
“Of course Joe, no problem. You can do whatever you would like. I’m not going to stop you.” The thing answered in a voice that was somehow too wavering, almost high pitched but in an animalistic way. It was also drooling, not a lot but enough that a few drops landed on my white t-shirt. I could feel the grip loosen on me and as soon as I did I squirmed out from underneath its hand, breaking into a full run before my legs knew they were moving. 
I could hear the thing let out a growl that could only be described as prehistoric, a screech that echoed through the rows of trees. I could see the clearing in the trees, I even saw cars moving through the parking lot. My nerves eased as I broke through the trees, I didn’t dare turn around I just sprinted through the double doors of the forestry center shed. I startled a forestry employee who spilled his coffee and shouted, 
“Hey what the fuck, kid?!” 
“I’m sorry, I just thought I saw something in the woods and I had to get to somewhere safe. I can just wait for my ride, they’re supposed to be here any second.” I laughed nervously, my sweaty, drool covered shirt stinking of the fear I had just exuded. 
“Okay, do you need me to call anyone? Need a drink? Anything? You’re looking pretty pale, bud. You should sit down. You’re Mikey’s stepson, yeah?” He said, handing me a bottle of water from a mini fridge that was sitting beside his desk. 
A tap on the window made me and this forest center employee (I think I remember that his name was Jack? Maybe Jeff? I met him once when I was younger) both jump and look wide eyed at the thing pretending to be my stepdad grinning at the glass. 
“Oh good, your stepdad’s here to pick you u-“ he began before I cut him off, 
“That’s not my stepdad. It’s wearing his skin but it’s not him.” I managed to say, barely above a whisper. 
“What did you say?” Jack asked, his hand reaching toward his walkie talkie, he clicked the button and spoke into the receiver on his shoulder, 
“Hey Bob, you notice anything weird about the forest today?” He asked, smiling back at the thing standing glaring through the plexiglass at me. 
“Please, just listen to me. I know it looks like him but it’s not him, you have to believe me.” 
I started, but was cut off by the walkies response, 
“Hey Jack, yeah I was gonna let you know, we found a bunch of dead animals, deer by the looks of them. Hard to tell, their skin was peeled off, nothing was eaten though, they’re just skinned. We’ve been dealing with this shitshow to think of even telling you, what do you think, hunters?” 
“What kind of hunter skins their prey without taking any of the meat?” Jack responded, slowly looking up to see the creature at the door reaching for the handle of the small shed, it stopped suddenly and in the same not so right voice said, 
“Come on Jack, let me in! I’m just trying to get Joe home safe to his mom.” 
Did I see a flash of anger in those reflective, animal like eyes? I think I did, 
“Just open the door and get him yourself, Mike. Nothing’s stopping you.. Just out of curiosity, what’s your wife’s name, Mike?” Jack replied, pulling his drawer open. I saw a buck knife lying in its sheath. Jack reached for it and the creatures eyes locked on his hands, tracking every bit of him reaching for the knife. 
“Come on Jack, you’ve known me for over 20 years. It’s me, just open up. Or i’ll huff and i’ll puff and i’ll blow your forestry shed down, ha ha ha. Her name is Mary of course. ” The creature laughed, or at least its version of a laugh. It sounded like marbles being rolled along a concrete floor. My mom’s name is not Mary, this was not my stepdad. 
“When I make my move, you fucking run. You hear me?” Jack muttered, not letting his lips move too much to give away his plan to the thing standing outside. The creatures eyes were not in the slightest filled with joy at this point. A look of malice and hate darkened every bit of its expression as Jack unsheathed the knife and yanked the door open, knocking the creature momentarily off balance, it dug it’s back hoofs into the dirt to remain on its feet after being knocked out of its spot. That’s what it had, not feet but hoofs, jammed into my stepdads old New Balance running shoes, the hoofs had ripped holes in the heel of the shoes while trying to chase me, it seemed. I saw all of this as if in slow motion as I ducked beneath Jacks arms and broke into a full sprint. 
I got to the highway eventually and flagged down a car, I heard a scuffle behind me and Jack screaming but I couldn’t risk a look back. When I finally did I saw two reflective eyes, peering from the edge of the woods as I drove off into the night. The nice lady who picked me up used to go to church with my mom, she knew where I lived and as we pulled up to my driveway my stomach dropped as my stepdad stood in the driveway, hands crossed over his chest. HIs eyes were reflecting the fading light, shining. My mother was staring out the window, her eyes were reflective as well. 
“Well, here we are. Home sweet home.” ",2,1760883875.0,scarystories,0,0.67,False

It was also drooling, not a lot but enough that a few drops landed on my white t-shirt. I could feel the grip loosen on me and as soon as I did I squirmed out from underneath its hand, breaking into a full run before my legs knew they were moving. 
I could hear the thing let out a growl that could only be described as prehistoric, a screech that echoed through the rows of trees. I could see the clearing in the trees, I even saw cars moving through the parking lot. My nerves eased as I broke through the trees, I didn’t dare turn around I just sprinted through the double doors of the forestry center shed. I startled a forestry employee who spilled his coffee and shouted, 
“Hey what the fuck, kid?!” 
“I’m sorry, I just thought I saw something in the woods and I had to get to somewhere safe. I can just wait for my ride, they’re supposed to be here any second.” I laughed nervously, my sweaty, drool covered shirt stinking of the fear I had just exuded. 
“Okay, do you need me to call anyone? Need a drink? Anything? You’re looking pretty pale, bud. You should sit down. You’re Mikey’s stepson, yeah?” He said, handing me a bottle of water from a mini fridge that was sitting beside his desk. 
A tap on the window made me and this forest center employee (I think I remember that his name was Jack? Maybe Jeff? I met him once when I was younger) both jump and look wide eyed at the thing pretending to be my stepdad grinning at the glass. 
“Oh good, your stepdad’s here to pick you u-“ he began before I cut him off, 
“That’s not my stepdad. It’s wearing his skin but it’s not him.” I managed to say, barely above a whisper. 
“What did you say?” Jack asked, his hand reaching toward his walkie talkie, he clicked the button and spoke into the receiver on his shoulder, 
“Hey Bob, you notice anything weird about the forest today?” He asked, smiling back at the thing standing glaring through the plexiglass at me. 
“Please, just listen to me. I know it looks like him but it’s not him, you have to believe me.” 
I started, but was cut off by the walkies response, 
“Hey Jack, yeah I was gonna let you know, we found a bunch of dead animals, deer by the looks of them. Hard to tell, their skin was peeled off, nothing was eaten though, they’re just skinned. We’ve been dealing with this shitshow to think of even telling you, what do you think, hunters?” 
“What kind of hunter skins their prey without taking any of the meat?” Jack responded, slowly looking up to see the creature at the door reaching for the handle of the small shed, it stopped suddenly and in the same not so right voice said, 
“Come on Jack, let me in! I’m just trying to get Joe home safe to his mom.” 
Did I see a flash of anger in those reflective, animal like eyes? I think I did, 
“Just open the door and get him yourself, Mike. Nothing’s stopping you.. Just out of curiosity, what’s your wife’s name, Mike?” Jack replied, pulling his drawer open. I saw a buck knife lying in its sheath. Jack reached for it and the creatures eyes locked on his hands, tracking every bit of him reaching for the knife. 
“Come on Jack, you’ve known me for over 20 years. It’s me, just open up. Or i’ll huff and i’ll puff and i’ll blow your forestry shed down, ha ha ha. Her name is Mary of course. ” The creature laughed, or at least its version of a laugh. It sounded like marbles being rolled along a concrete floor. My mom’s name is not Mary, this was not my stepdad. 
“When I make my move, you fucking run. You hear me?” Jack muttered, not letting his lips move too much to give away his plan to the thing standing outside. The creatures eyes were not in the slightest filled with joy at this point. A look of malice and hate darkened every bit of its expression as Jack unsheathed the knife and yanked the door open, knocking the creature momentarily off balance, it dug it’s back hoofs into the dirt to remain on its feet after being knocked out of its spot. That’s what it had, not feet but hoofs, jammed into my stepdads old New Balance running shoes, the hoofs had ripped holes in the heel of the shoes while trying to chase me, it seemed. I saw all of this as if in slow motion as I ducked beneath Jacks arms and broke into a full sprint. 
I got to the highway eventually and flagged down a car, I heard a scuffle behind me and Jack screaming but I couldn’t risk a look back. When I finally did I saw two reflective eyes, peering from the edge of the woods as I drove off into the night. The nice lady who picked me up used to go to church with my mom, she knew where I lived and as we pulled up to my driveway my stomach dropped as my stepdad stood in the driveway, hands crossed over his chest. HIs eyes were reflecting the fading light, shining. My mother was staring out the window, her eyes were reflective as well.

1oaqwqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1oaqwqs/is_anyone_living_in_france/,Is anyone living in France?,"Hello everyone.
I came to France about three months ago. I used to live in Turkey, but something that happened to my relatives affected me deeply, and I had to leave the country.

My life was good before, but I went through a lot of difficulties. I’ve always been a kind person who thinks about others. I used to worry even about the people who hurt me. I gave a lot of money as help, charity, and loans, but most of it never came back.

Before I came here, people told me that Christians only care about themselves and are not kind.
But when I arrived, I saw something completely different. I had no place to stay and had to sleep outside. The first night, I met a man who was also sleeping on the street. I asked if I could sleep on the upper step near him. He said yes, then offered me his blanket. I refused, but he insisted. I was shocked — even though he had almost nothing, he shared what little he had with me. He even gave me a small bottle of milk to keep me warm. That night, thanks to him, I didn’t freeze.

Later I worked in a few jobs without a permit, because I had no choice. Sadly, I was mistreated by some Muslim employers, and even mocked. One of them tried to give me drugs, but I’ve never used anything like that in my life.

One day, I was driving my boss’s car to get food, and it broke down on the road. I sat inside and cried, thinking everything was going wrong. But surprisingly, almost every car that passed by stopped to ask if I needed help. I was amazed, because in Turkey, most people wouldn’t stop for a stranger.

Now I work in construction, doing insulation work in a house. I had never done this kind of job before — I used to run restaurants for years. It’s very hard for me, and sometimes I feel like crying because my body can’t take it anymore. The weather is cold, and it’s exhausting, but I have no other choice. Still, one day the house owner saw me freezing and brought me hot coffee and turned on a heater. That small kindness meant a lot to me.

I’ve always lived with my family. My father passed away from cancer five years ago. That was one of the hardest things I ever went through. Now, my biggest challenge is being here without a family. They are all far away, and sometimes I just wish I could talk to them or have a meal together again.

All these experiences changed my view completely. I realized that goodness can exist anywhere, in any heart.
I want to learn more about Christianity and walk in that path — not because of any pressure, but because I have seen real compassion here.

Jesus said, “Love your neighbor as yourself.” And that’s exactly what I saw here in France.

Is there anyone who could help me learn more about the Christian faith or guide me on how to begin?

1oaqu5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1oaqu5p/houston_trip_report/,Houston trip report,"Finished a trip to Houston based on the recommendations here. Overall all the places were good. Specialty cups ranged from $11-18 ($18 seems insane pricing for Houston)

* blendin - this is the shop owned by the winner of the 2024 brewers cup for decaf. I tried to nerd out with the barista to see what goes into a winning cup but he wasn’t really having it. They had the most tools for pour overs including melodrip. Each variety has a separate recipe in terms of brewing style and grind size, etc so this is probably going to be this subs favorite place. The coffee I selected was perfectly dialed in for the brew so I can only blame myself for picking a delicate geisha that I knew I wouldn’t enjoy. 

* simply coffie - parking is bad here. Also the specialty list was confusing cause they only brew the ones with a dot on the menu - except the one they gave me didn’t have a dot so it was special.  Cafe experience is kinda bad too since there’s only 2 people working, so it takes about 10-15 mins from when you order to get the cup and it can be a long wait to order also. However the coffee I got here was the favorite I had on the trip. It was a Panamanian natural roast that had really complex flavors throughout if a bit higher acidity on the finish. 

* tenfold coffee - I was the first customer in the door so it might have not been fully up to speed yet. The selection was limited to 2 coffees and I think their grinder was maybe set at espresso since the flavors lacked clarity and was overall really muddy in flavor (all the fines we complain about). Overall just giving it a pass here but it would be the one I skip of these next time. 

* Catalina coffee (Amaya roaster) - this was the most affordable cup at $5 and it was actually surprisingly good. It was perfectly balanced in flavors if perhaps lacking some truly outstanding specialty flavors but it still checked all the boxes. This is the place that most people should go to unless they really want to nerd out. 

Overall it was a great solid trip and I’m glad there’s several great places to visit",3,1760883613.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I’ve got  a crush on someone and I’m not sure if it’s totally unprofessional or not. I’m an FY2 on a  ward, and there’s been a fair bit of maintenance work going on recently. Among the team, there’s this one plumber.  We have been chatting, he mentioned he’s single and asked if I was too, but before I could actually properly answer, one of the nurses basically  dragged me off to see a patient (brilliant timing). He’s finishing up next week.  I’d really like to ask if he fancies grabbing a coffee sometime, but I’m not sure if that’d be seen as unprofessional, since I’m staff and he’s a contractor on-site. Would it be out of line to ask him for a coffee as female, or is that fairly harmless as long as I’m respectful about it?",6,1760883467.0,doctorsUK,20,0.64,False

They lay in bed all day I while I care for their baby, cook, clean, organize, etc. None of this would bother me but I could deep clean for 8 hours straight and come back the next day and it's destroyed. They are slobs. Dishes will sit in the sink all weekend and I will come back on Monday to a disaster. I'm talking mold in dishes, formula caked to bottles, dirty diapers all over the floor.... I'm exhausted. 
With all of that aside, mom is just not very nice. She makes snide remarks about ""I know youre on a budget but..."" Or if I take a day off she makes sly remarks. She also texts me on weekends about things, like she thinks I'm available 24/7 for her and I have tried to make it clear that I am not. My husband and I have been long distance for 4 years and his visa has finally been approved and he moves home a week from this wednesday. I planned a vacation for us to celebrate in November and she replies to the email I sent to the nanny agency saying ""just to be clear if she has no vacation time we will not be covering her."" Which is FINE I did not expect them to but I know her and that was very passive aggressive. I do everything for this family, even making them lunch or coffee or snacks and bringing it to them in bed...
