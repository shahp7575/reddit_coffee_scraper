\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ikcrb1,https://i.redd.it/6l8n3qjltthe1.jpeg,Need title / link please. TIA,"Two years ago, April 21, was the day lost our first child. While I lay in the cold, sterile operating room, undergoing a D&C procedure, my ‘on–a–business–trip‘ husband was celebrating another woman’s birthday.

The irony was almost suffocating.

My hands trembled as I scrolled further through her posts. Since that day, she had been flaunting all kinds of luxury items, each one identical to things I owned, except for one.

A jasmine–scented perfume.

Then I saw her most recent post, pinned at the top. It was an ultrasound image. She was pregnant.

I dropped my phone, my heart pounding, and frantically searched through the dirty laundry basket. I found the shirt Daniel had worn the night before. Lifting it to my nose, the unmistakable scent of jasmine hit me.

I never wear perfume.

When I didn’t respond to the message, the person on the other end. grew impatient. My phone buzzed again and again as photos and videos came flooding in. Clutching my belly, I sank onto the couch, struggling to breathe.

I forced myself to look at the undeniable evidence of Daniel’s betrayal. The woman in the photos was young and beautiful, her ponytail. bouncing with life. There were pictures of her and Daniel.

He was rowing on a lake, playing in the snow, and tucking a maple leaf into her hair. It was as though each season, spring, summer, fall, and winter, was captured in their little love story.

Taking a deep breath, I shakily opened one of the videos. In it, Daniel stood by the ocean, tenderly calling her ‘My Carina.‘

She softly asked, “Do you love me?”

This was my husband of seven years, the father of the baby growing inside me, replying with a warmth I hadn’t seen in years.

‘I’ll always love you, Cara.’

I replayed the video over and over, tears streaming down my face. As dusk fell, the room around me grew dim.

Daniel finally came home. His voice was gentle as he lightly scolded me, “Olivia, why didn’t you turn on the lights? It’s so dark! What if you fall?”

He flipped the light switch, and the room lit up. I quickly covered my tear–streaked face as he knelt in front of me and took my hand.

“Why are you crying? Who made my precious wife and our little one so sad?” he asked, his voice soft as he kissed my belly.

As he leaned closer, I smelled the same sweet jasmine fragrance. Struggling to keep calm, I asked, “Where were you?”

“I was working late at the office. What’s wrong, honey?” Daniel replied casually, as though nothing was out of the ordinary..

‘You’re lying, Daniel. You were with Cara! She had a craving for those famous dumplings from the east side of the city, and since there was no delivery, you drove over an hour from the west side to get them for her. She even live–streamed the whole thing!‘

Feigning nonchalance, I smiled, gently squeezing his hand. “Honey, I suddenly have a craving for those dumplings from the east side, too,” I said, resting my hands on my belly.

As if sensing my pain, the baby kicked hard. “Can you get some for me?”

Annoyance flickered across Daniel’s face as he pulled his hand away, frustration creeping into his expression. “Those dumplings aren’t anything special. Besides, you’re pretty far along. You should watch what you eat.” Standing up, he added, “For the sake of our son, just bear with it a little longer, okay?”

Without waiting for a response, he muttered, “I’m going to take a shower. I’m exhausted. Why don’t you call Mom and ask her to make you something?”

The bathroom door clicked shut.

Swallowing my sobs, I gently stroked my belly and whispered, “Oh, sweetheart, you and I are about to fight a tough battle together.”

Chapter 2

Daniel’s phone blinked on the dining table. As usual, he never even tried to hide his infidelity in front of me.

Did he really think I was that naïve?

The sound of water running in the bathroom echoed through the house. With a sigh, I struggled with my pregnant belly and slowly stood up. Hoping for a quick solution, I tried all the obvious. passwords from our wedding anniversary and our birthdays, but none of them worked. My hands trembled as I entered the date from Cara’s ultrasound report.

Success!

Biting my lip in frustration, I sneered as I opened the messaging app’s storage. Sure enough, Cara’s profile picture was there. Their avatars matched.

He said, “If love lasts forever,” and she replied, “Does it matter if we’re together every day?”

I clicked into the chat and was greeted by a flood of “Darling, I miss you” and “Baby, when will I see you again?” Determined not to let my emotions take over, I activated the screen recording feature.

Next, I opened Daniel’s shopping app. To my dismay, his order history was filled with pregnancy supplements, skincare products, and makeup. They were all sent to the same address. Every delivery was made to Cara.

With one hand resting on my restless baby, I took screenshots with the other. I sent the videos and screenshots to myself, then carefully deleted the evidence. Satisfied that everything was in order, I placed the phone back exactly where I’d found it.

Waddling back to the bedroom, I lay down on my side. The weight of betrayal settled over me as my heart felt like it had a hole ripped. through it, and I couldn’t stop shivering from the cold weight of betrayal. After seven years of marriage, I had been reduced to a cruel joke.

When Daniel came out of the shower, his phone rang. From my vantage point, through the crack in the door, I saw his face soften as he answered the call. Glancing toward the bedroom, he carefully stepped out onto the balcony, closing the door behind him.

Curiosity gnawing at me, I forced myself up and stood by the door, watching him. I couldn’t make out the words, but his expression was tender, with a slight smile. At some point, whoever was on the other end must have said something that made him frown in discomfort. But soon enough, he caved, agreeing with a subtle smile.

The chill in my chest deepened. Slowly, I turned and dragged myself back to bed, feeling as if the air had been sucked out of the room. Even breathing felt like a burden.

A few minutes later, I heard Daniel tiptoe back inside. One of his. hands rested on my belly while the other gently brushed the hair from my forehead.

His voice was soft as he whispered, “Baby, there’s an urgent project at work. I need to go in.”

I turned my head and stared deeply into his eyes. My last shred of hope flickered weakly as I asked, “I don’t feel well. Could you stay?”

For a brief moment, I thought that if he chose to stay with me instead of running to her, I could try to forgive him.

But then I remembered: Once the kite string snaps, it can never be fixed.

As expected, Daniel gave me a troubled smile, trying to reassure me. “Sweetheart, this project is essential for the company. Lean’t miss it.” “I’ll call Mom to come over and stay with you, okay?”

A wave of nausea washed over me, goosebumps prickling my skin. Still, I managed to force out the words, “Drive safely.”

I lay there in silence, watching him get dressed and leave. Slowly, I got up, holding my belly, and made my way downstairs to hail a taxi. “Maplewood Estates,” I told the driver.

He sped through the streets, and just as we arrived, I saw Daniel’s car pull in. My stomach clenched as I asked the driver to park behind a tree. From the back seat, I watched as Cara fluttered into Daniel’s arms like a butterfly.

He caught her gently, placing a hand on her flat stomach. His face softened with a look of tender reproach, and he playfully tapped her nose.

Cradling my belly with one hand, I took out my phone and switched to video mode. With trembling fingers, I watched through the screen as Daniel lifted Cara into the passenger seat and carefully buckled her seatbelt.

My eyes burned, but I blinked back the tears.

“Driver, follow that car,” I said.

The car climbed onto the overpass, neon lights flashing by outside the window. In a daze, my nails dug into the window frame until they split, the sharp pain snapping me back to reality. I put my bleeding fingers into my mouth and bit down hard.

As the car wove through the city streets, I repeated to myself repeatedly, “Olivia, endure it. The pain will pass.”

When we arrived at Riverside General Hospital, I scanned the QR code to pay the driver.

As I stepped out of the car, the usually quiet driver turned to me and said, with unexpected kindness, “Miss, take care of yourself. For the baby’s sake, don’t hurt yourself.”

Since discovering Daniel’s affair, I hadn’t told a soul. The secret felt like poison, slowly eating away at me from the inside. The kindness of a stranger felt like a fresh breath of air, pulling me back from the abyss.

I gently closed the car door, offering him a small smile. “Don’t worry, Sir. No–one can hurt me anymore. Because I’m ready to throw the trash where it belongs.”

Chapter 3

I hid behind a pillar, watching Daniel. He had been too busy with work to attend a single prenatal check–up with me during my entire pregnancy. Yet here he was, running around the hospital, registering, picking up medication, and gently helping another woman in and out like the perfect husband.

At that moment, I realized it wasn’t that he was too busy. He didn’t want to make an effort for the wife he’d been married to for seven years.

In the bustling hospital lobby, Daniel held the woman close, reminding her, “The doctor said you should eat less tonight and try to stay active. In the early stages of pregnancy, digestion can be tricky, so let’s follow the advice this time, okay?”

“Aww, fine, I got it!” she replied, pouting playfully. But it’s your fault! You bought way too many dumplings.”

“Alright, alright, I’ll take the blame,” he said with a smile. “It’s my fault. for making my sweetheart eat too much, okay?”

“That’s better.” She smirked. “Fine, I’ll forgive you… this time.”

As I watched them, they bantered like a real couple, close and inseparable, while I stood under the hospital’s harsh fluorescent lights, feeling like an intruder in my own life. I was invisible to them. With a heavy heart, I held my belly and slowly shuffled out of the hospital. Outside, the scene was no less cruel. The rain had started. The cold autumn wind blew against me, and the rain felt like it was trying to drown the world in its chill. Through the mist, I watched as Daniel draped his coat over her, shielding her from the rain and gently helping her into the front passenger seat.

The woman smiled up at him, grabbing his tie and pulling him in for a kiss. My husband cupped her face and kissed her deeply right there in the rain. When they finally pulled apart, he tapped her nose playfully, and she tugged on his tie again, biting his lip hard.

To my surprise, instead of getting upset, he just smiled like he was

thrilled. Then, he got into the car. As the car was about to pull away, the woman rolled down the window, locking eyes with me.

She gave me a smug, taunting look and said, “Olivia, you’ve lost.”

I smiled and shook my head. A strange calm washed over me. “It’s okay, Olivia.”

Then, I whispered to myself, “He’s just a man, nothing more.”

As the car turned the corner, I waved. “Daniel, I don’t want you anymore. You’re hers.”

In that decisive moment, standing under the hospital awning, I calmly sent all the evidence I had gathered to my mentor, a well–known divorce lawyer. I was going to secure the best future for my child, no matter what.

By the time I finished, the rain had already soaked the hem of my dress. Oddly enough, I barely noticed. Just as I put my phone away, it rang.

It was Mom.

“Olivia, I made some soup for you and brought it to the house. Where are you and Danny? Why aren’t you home?” Her voice was filled with warmth and concern.

Before I could respond, she continued, “Oh, that Danny. You’re this far along, and he’s still taking you out? You really need to be careful right now.”

Hearing my mom’s voice felt like a blow, like opening a floodgate I had been trying so hard to keep closed. All the pain I had been holding in grew into an overwhelming weight, pressing down on my chest. I bit down hard on my lip, fighting back the sob rising in my throat. The pain of suppressing it sent a shiver through my entire body.

“Mom, don’t worry,” I said, forcing a smile even though she couldn’t see me.

“We’re just out having dinner.” I swallowed hard, trying to keep my voice steady. “Oh, we’re being careful. Danny’s right here with me.”

I had to keep it together. I couldn’t let my mom hear me cry. I wouldn’t.

“It’s raining, Mom. Drive home safely, okay? Text me when you get there.”

I hung up quickly before my voice could betray me. Once the call ended, I took a deep breath and tried to hold everything in, but no matter how hard I tried, the tears finally spilled over. I cried quietly, my body trembling under the weight of it all.

There I stood, a heavily pregnant woman, belly aching, surrounded by strangers coming and going from the hospital. And in that cold, indifferent world, I cried until I had no more tears left in me.

Chapter 4

Daniel didn’t come home that night. Instead, he only sent a text:

‘Hey Olivia, I’m working late tonight and crashing into the office. It’s getting cold and rainy, so don’t forget to close the window before bed. Love you always, your husband.‘

I read the message without feeling anything. In the past, I would have worried, replied, or waited for Daniel. Now, I didn’t even bother to respond. I used to think I was the happiest woman in the world because I had the best husband. But reality hit me hard. It had all been a ridiculous facade. People’s hearts are hidden behind their ribs, and their lies are scribbled on paper.

A few days later, I received the divorce papers my lawyer had drafted. I printed them out, signed my name, and started packing up my things to move back to my mom’s place. Just as I was getting ready to leave, my phone rang with an unknown number.

It was Cara.

We met at a café downstairs. Cara arrived with an air of confidence, sitting across from me with a smug smile, a supermarket shopping bag by her side. Three months pregnant and balancing on thin high heels, she looked at me as if she had already won.

“I thought you wouldn’t come,” she said, a smug lilt in her voice. “After all, you never replied to my messages.”

I smiled calmly. My heart was steady, not a flicker of emotion breaking through. “Why wouldn’t I come? I haven’t done anything shameful that I need to hide.” I leaned back, still smiling. “Besides, Daniel and I are legally married, so I have nothing to hide. Unlike some people who, no matter how hard they try, will always be the hidden third.” “You-!” she snapped, but I cut her off again.

“Oh, and thank you, by the way,” I said, my voice steady. “For sending me all the evidence of your little affair with Daniel. Collecting all that would’ve been much harder on my own.”

I smiled, this time more dismissively. “So, this coffee’s on me.”

I placed some cash under my cup, stood up slowly, and rested my hand on my belly.

“What do you mean by that?” she asked through clenched teeth as she grabbed my arm.

“It means I don’t want him anymore, I replied, pulling my arm free. “If you want him, he’s all yours.”

Her eyes narrowed, and she threw my arm aside angrily. “What game are you playing now? Don’t think I’m buying this for a second!”

The force of her shove sent me stumbling backward, and I fell to the floor. At that moment, it felt like a knife had ripped through my belly. Pain shot through me, and I felt my body convulsed.

Blood poured from between my legs, and I screamed in terror, “Save my baby!”

I barely registered Cara fleeing in panic. Forcing myself to stay calm, I asked the café staff to call an ambulance. By the time they lifted me into the ambulance, my dress was drenched in blood.

As my consciousness began to slip away, I heard a nurse asking for my phone password. I unlocked it for her, and they called my emergency contact, my husband, six times.

At least, that’s what he told me. Regardless, a few months back I started making myself go out on friday nights to try and socialize. I’m not great at making friends so I mostly just hung out and sang karaoke. I met this nice guy but it didn’t go anywhere and I didn’t see him again until December. I ran into him again, had a really good conversation and ended up exchanging phone numbers. We got coffee and it was great. We were both super up front about what we wanted in life and luckily enough, it matched up really well. We chat over text, Christmas comes and goes and we go out again. He asks me to be his girlfriend and I accept. We talk about our hopes and dreams, our expectations from a partner and it’s all wonderful. 

Things continue wonderfully, we get along really well, our values align, we both really like the outdoors and the idea of homesteading. We spent new years together and everything was going so very well. He started changing his diet so that he wouldn’t have to worry about eating anything that might get me sick. He told me that he would give me the next 75 years and I told him that if we both lived that long I reserved the right to extend the timeline. He met my folks and I met some of his. 

I had about given up on finding my person when he came into my life. Then he showed up and I started to hope that I wouldn’t be alone. I never told him that the first time we met was right around the same time I caught the bouquet at my cousin’s wedding. I didn’t put much stock in the old wives tale but the longer we were together the more I started to wonder. 

Then he ran into his ex who offered to give him a chance to live his dream. She also expressed interest in getting back together with him. The next day he showed up at my house and told me that he was going to pursue his dream and that that meant that he was going to be spending a lot of time with her. I told him I didn’t like it (we are both firmly monogamous and this had been discussed before) but that I wasn’t going to break up with him over it because I trusted him. He told me to take a couple of days to think about it. I did and my resolve solidified, after all relationships take work and he was worth fighting for. I asked him if we could talk so that we could discuss where our heads were at he agreed and we met at a neutral location. Then he told me that this wasn’t fair to me and that he was breaking up with me. I tried to talk to him but he had made up his mind that he was doing the right thing. So I told him that if nothing I could say would change his mind then he may as well just go. So he did. 
Now it’s over. 
The plans we made, dust in the wind.
The promises we made taste like ash in my mouth.
Despite it all, I just want him to show up and tell me that it was a mistake to break up. To tell me that he still loves me and that he wants me and the life we were planning just as much as I do. To tell me that he wants to fight for us too.

As promised, here are my photos of the 1995 Pork Chow Mein MRE that came in first place along with the Corned Beef Hash in my recent poll, as well as my personal remarks regarding my overall experience with it.

Lets start with the Bag, along with the contents:

https://preview.redd.it/bdfnttbuzshe1.jpg?width=4624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77492f205fc459d7ed0e13d9b49419e2a5f190c3

Here is the outer bag. Being 1995, I think this should be the last year the ""brown bags"" were still in use before being replaced by the lighter, tan, packaging.

This particular meal was packaged by Right Away Foods, of McAllen Texas.

https://preview.redd.it/qmxjv3360the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76d05bd5d31a80a4a8aaa7e8f4e127616c6904da

Here is the complete MRE as it came packaged. This includes:

1. The Main Entree, ""Pork Chow Mein"", which was actually produced by Shelf Stable Foods INC. of Cincinnati Ohio. Being born in Toledo Ohio myself, I am always absolutely floored to get stuff made in my home state.

https://preview.redd.it/njklj15p2the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a94c5981a4ba3fdbb65cbbeb3979627d11120ddc

https://preview.redd.it/viq34l8v2the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c399723a18f90e62863849dc31f5ea03c442980

2. Noodles, Chow Mein. A special side item that is designed specifically to be paired with the Pork Chow Mein entree. This was packed by Right Away Foods of McAllen, as well.

https://preview.redd.it/0cjzdedy2the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6745569cd9d8b2b92e129154d1554ed590974b38

4. Crackers. Standard MRE Crackers of this generation, again packaged by McAllen.

https://preview.redd.it/n99bany13the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b22762da8ba50eb3c9d424f0b703287a74dc7b0

5. Fortified Peanut Butter. This is a smooth peanut butter which was packed by Thermo Pac of Stone Mountain Georgia. Packaged here to go with the crackers, and arguably to be paired with the Pork Chow Mein as a ""peanut sauce"".

https://preview.redd.it/vc2akjh63the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c761efc0fabc4926d23d81b7582b0d57d2eb43a

6. Baverage Base Powder, Orange Flavor. Packaged by Trans-Packers Services Corp. of Brooklyn New York. This was designed to make 12 fluid ounces (330ml) of an orange isotonic beverage similar to gatorade.

https://preview.redd.it/6qo2tn6d3the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54b6c755c6b1b37cccb932d331fd2746aba34a24

7. M & M Candy. This is a 1995 dated bag as well. More astute observers will have noticed already from the overview picture that the bag has already changed since 1994 to a more modern design. It seems that somewhere around this time period the bag was updated. It seems to have been packaged in Hackettstown New Jersey by Mars. 

Unfortunately, due the photo limit per post, I've had to combine the ""contents"" picture for the M & M candy with the initial packaging photo. Notice here how the lighter brown M & M pieces have already gone the way of the dodo. The pack size has not changed, though.

8. An Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Covered. Packaged by McAllen of Texas again.

https://preview.redd.it/atifrnqo3the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28cbd59c11b597f7bf8955629f0f01cb71a57c6b

9. An FRH, MRE Spoon (of the modern type), and Accessory Packet ""A"". Accessory Packet ""A"" containing: Tobasco brand hot sauce, Domino Brand Sugar (6 grams), toilet paper, matches, Tasters Choice Coffee in the standard red package of the time, generic mint chewing gum, a wet nap brand towelette, iodized salt, and a dry non dairy cream substitute for the coffee. The Tobasco was in decent shape, which is always a positive indication things haven't been stored too poorly. The tasters choice seemed a little ""caked""; but, not to a point where it was certainly bad, finally, the mint gum looked a little ""aged""; but, also not any worse than some much newer pieces I've seen. All in all, a healthy indicator of things to come.

The FRH is quite an old design, and its obvious there were some issues with these ones leaking their fillings. The inside of the bag is absolutely full of the filings which make up the filling of the MRE heater. Certainly, the newer ones are far more effective at containing their fuel mixtures. Due to how poorly these tend to age, I never try to heat old MREs with these heaters, especially ones I intend to consume entirely, thus I didn't even bother destroying this one to attempt a reaction.

A final note on the contents: I have mentioned that this is a 1995. What I have not yet talked about is just how late of a 1995 this is. I would guess this is probably one of the very last bags packed that year, as all of the components are quite late 1995 production. The crackers being made in early December of 1995! Quite interesting, especially considering that this would have been the last year of the brown bags, and the last of the 12 menu years!

https://preview.redd.it/49y9lv9p4the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f4300eaec57e2df018bdc5adc5a28456be8f1043

https://preview.redd.it/lrnt0e6s4the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0705ae0f80289421823df66ea0c509ca5d3b1187

The contents now having been fully examined, its time to actually examine them and consume them.

As always, I try to give these old MRE's a fair chance. This means I eat them fully heated (Boiled for 6 minutes to both warm them and kill any of the worst food borne illnessess to ensure my own safety), and I eat them on an empty stomach after a full day which includes 10km walking and running, as well as an hour of cardio and an additional  strenght training routine. These aren't quite field conditions; but, this does mean I burn on average 3000 calories a day and am active for a good portion of the day as a general rule. As such, my objective levels of hunger do approach that of many men in the field by the end of the day, and I'm usually hungry enough that I'll eat nearly anything with an open mind; but, I am not starving to the point that I will think anything edible tastes good.

After all, an MRE is not a snack for a man who has already had 3 square meals, cooked in his own kitchen, topped off with an entire box of oreos. It is not a 5 star meal. It isn't a flavorful meal. It is a meal specifically designed to include a balance of macros tailored to the needs of men who are active in the field. It is thus carb heavy and should not be unreasonably hard to digest, nor strongly seasoned.

Sadly, I see a-lot of people who speak about their experience with MRE's very negatively after eating them on a full stomach, and with visible cookie crumbs on their table or workbench. Without passing judgement on these individuals, this is simply not a fair perspective from which to judge a field ration. I myself remember when I was a reasonably round teenager and was given an MRE for the first time; I found it quite unenjoyable in comparison to a fast food hamburger and a fruit pie. Exceptionally unsurprising! Men in the field also want hamburgers and fried fruit pies! But, this is not possible, and it is often the case that a field kitchen is not even able to be brought up, thus the MRE is the solution to this problem.

As such, I frown upon this behavior without reservation. and I encourage anyone who has never had an MRE before to first try to give an MRE the right conditions to be consumed in before passing judgement on it!

Starting with the Main ""Meal"" along with the Mealtime Beverage:

https://preview.redd.it/08spkft88the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e321583c68d750d782bee05a1c8b057f7b181c92

This is how the Pork Chow Mein came out of the bag after heating. This is without the addition of any Tobasco or the Chow Mein Noodles. There are large visible pieces of pork, celery, and water chesnuts. There were apparently some mushrooms in here too; but, they were not very ""present"" in the flavor of the meal, nor in its general appearance. This meal did contain two ""chemical"" type additives in the form of Disodium Indsinate, and Disodium Guanylate. This combination is used specifically to enhance the umami flavor of the meal, in the same way MSG might be used in similar food products.

An initial taste test of this dish revealed it to be quite inoffensive in taste. Not very salty. Not very strongly flavored. I would contend that the flavors of the pork and the celery were some of the strongest ones present, along with the mild broth flavor of the sauce. The water chesnuts held up very well, and provided a very solid feeling of eating something ""chinese like"". I can imagine that men 30 years ago would have been very happy with this take on ""chinese food""; though, today this would not truly pass muster as a chinese dish.

Now Looking at the Chow Mein Noodles:

https://preview.redd.it/qkpbxn4v9the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e736c3682e5003f0931c39ffceca32340f361b7f

These were completely as advertised. A deep fried ""noodle"" which had quite a few similarities with a fried potato stick. I believe that such fried noodles are still quite obtainable and found at many ""Asian"" buffets or in the super market as a topper used in the same way french fried onions and bacon crumbs are used. I seem to remember these also being popular at salad bars for a time in the 90s and very early 2000s? The first few bites of these revealed absolutely nothing ""off"" about the test of the noodles; though, some spoiling of the oils within them seems to have occurred, as a few of them had a gentle ""expired potato chips"" flavor to them that was on the cusp of rancidity; but, not quite spoiled enough to deserve the title. Entirely enjoyable; but, old!

Due to image limits, I can't post a photo of the noodles added to the Pork Chow Mein in this initial post; however, my opinion is that they actually did very little for the actual dish itself. Naturally, there was very little else to do with them; but, I found that even though they were unsalted, and had a very agreeable taste, they simply added no new ""dimension"" to the flavor of the Pork Chow Mein, and in some ways tamed its already very mild flavor. I think they had the greatest impact on the ""texture"" of the dish; though, I am not sure I would call this impact either positive or negative. It was simply ""there"". In any case, a very cool item that is between a side dish and a main course!

Now the Crackers and Peanut Butter:

https://preview.redd.it/p19cvx5hhthe1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb408147665d8d7aa301778b4237f42632a4335

Here are the crackers as they came out of the package. As usual, these are pretty bulletproof. These ones still have a perfect seal on the bag; despite this, they were a little on the ""stale"" end, in a similar way that the Chow Mein Noodles were. Nothing wrong with them at all, and they were perfectly edible; but, worth noting.

Now the Peanut Butter:

https://preview.redd.it/dwxar7fvhthe1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cafa6d407faf961617e673b3aa005d986c7835b0

Again, due to image restraints, a compromise has had to be made here. A small amount of the peanut butter has been pictured on the \*Suppenteller\* I have used to serve the Chow Mein in. This shot also shows the Chow Mein with the Tobasco added to it.

(A fun fact for people back home in the USA: Many Germans traditionally do not really eat out of ""Bowls""; but, large, saucer like plates which are rather shallow and quite wide. The Suppenteller is gently tilted at the rim in order to concentrate your meal into a corner to be picked up with your spoon as it becomes emptier. Many older people here find bowls as we know them to be rather uncouth to eat from, though they have become more popular for eating cereal and similar dishes).

In any case, back to the peanut butter: As we can see here, I've tried to eat the Chow Mein with some of the peanut butter in an attempt to try and improvise a ""peanut sauce"". I have done this not truly out of my own imagination; but, because I have heard from a number of old hands that this was quite popular to do with this menu. I will be the first to admit that I do not think I am not old enough to find that this flavor combination passes muster. The peanut butter provided is a very smooth, very processed, very sweet variety. All this means that, for better or worse, it is not suitable for being used as a peanut sauce substitute when considering our more evolved taste expectations when it comes to ""Asian Food"". It may very well be that this was an anticipated and accepted taste to guys who were in their 20s and 30s back in the 90s, and who had eaten earlier Americanizations of Asian food; however, its just too much for my taste expectations to accept, and I don't like it! Since I never ate chinese food as a little boy in the 90s, I don't know how normal it was to slap standard creamy peanut butter on the end of the buffet line and call it peanut sauce; but, that just wasn't good. Sorry old hands! I'm with the Whippersnappers on this one!

That being said, the peanut butter itself was divine. As with many products, I believe peanut butter tastes ever so different today than it did even 20 odd years ago. One of the great things about MREs is that they have allowed these older versions of such products to be well preserved in small quantities to be eaten decades later, allowing relatively fair taste comparisons. Overall, it was a bit smoother, bit sweeter, and less textured than modern creamy peanut butters. Its taste and texture was closest to the modern Skippy brand. I enjoyed the majority of this on my crackers, which is paired very fairly with.

The big question here is: Should this really be the ""side"" for this menu? The peanut butter is far to sweet to pair with the meal itself; but, crackers were the side item with pretty much every menu at this point, meaning it is indeed the ""side"" no matter how you slice it or would desire it. I do believe a version of this menu had freeze dried fruit too instead of the Candy, so you could have eaten that as your side instead, and had this as dessert. That probably was more reasonable; but, less easily done in the field. That all being said, I enjoyed these as an extended dessert item with the peanut butter later, and nobody stopped me!

Now checking out the Mealtime Beverage:

https://preview.redd.it/mc3h6fy6bthe1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5cd7593757621cf350135a50765954e97734f831

The powder itself before mixing. It had a very pale ""yellow"" color, as is typical of many of the earlier orange beverage bases. As you can see, its held up perfectly fine, nothing wrong with it at all, no caking, off color, weird smell, etc.

It made 330ml (12 fluid ounces) of orange beverage.

https://preview.redd.it/2ryvoonebthe1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=708a54fcb1fc20c217182db23a450dd8dbca8033

Here is a portion of the mixed beverage prepared as prescribed (my glass did not quite contain all of it, so some I left in measuring cup until I had consumed some). I have heard some people complain that these beverages have a distinct ""vitamin flavor"" to them, which I can certainly confirm is the case; though, I'm not entirely sure that the flavor is exceptionally intrusive.

I think it's very important for people, especially younger people who did not have the chance to form any memories to the contrary, to understand just how long ago 30 to 40 years ago really was in terms of food science. Atrificial and shelf stable flavors were very different than the absolutely fantastic flavors we enjoy today, this was true even into the 90s and early 2000s when I was a kid. It was simply far more difficult to make food and (especially) drinks which had been fortified with vitamins taste as though this were not the case. There is a reason why cereals for kids, which were and are still fortified, were and are simply loaded with sugars! I would even argue that this drink mix did a decent job of taking the ""edge"" off the fortified flavor compared to some other stuff that I remember of the same vintage. Anyone who remembers some of, the ""muscle shake"" powders from back in the 90s will certainly remember how much those tasted like you had crushed up a pile of chewable vitamin tablets and mixed them with thickened milk and aspartame.

On-top of this, another consideration is that these mixes had, and continue to have another, more humanitarian purpose, and that is covering up the taste of lukewarm, chemically purified, water. Anyone who has drank from a water trailer will know how awful this water objectively tastes, even if its not dangerous to drink. Thus, that annoying taste it has actually carries with it the benefit of covering up one even worse off taste with another, less upsetting one.

Thus, in summary, this drink mix is absolutely fine as it stands. I do believe it was supposed to compete with the flavor of orange gatorade or something similar. It doesn't come \*that\* close to this particular goal; but, is certainly very drinkable and gets flying colors at its goal of carrying sugar, macros, and vitamins into the body while covering up goofy water taste.

The broader question of how well it pairs with the meal itself is harder to answer. All in all, I think something else would have paired with this dish a tad better; but, the question of course is what else could have really been included at that point in time? Probably not much else while rounding out the nutrition goals of the menu. Thus, I can't knock it at all.

This now just leaves us to discuss the dessert items and the dessert beverage:

First the dessert items:

The M & M Candy:

Please see the above photograph, as image constraints mean I had to use the same photograph for the itemized description, and this portion of the review.

The M & M Candy was absolutely fine as always. Enjoyable, crunchy, chocolately. Probably not much more to say here. They tasted just like new ones do, and looked like them too. The light brown ones were already gone!

The M & M's seem to be the most commonly seen ""Candy"" of the three which were supposed to be included in the MRE's of this generation. There were either Charms, Heat Stable Chocolate Bars, or the M & M's. I think from the point of view of a ground pounder, I'd want the M & M's the most. I've never hat the heat stable chocolate; but, have heard its awful from a number of guys, and the Charms are difficult to eat due to the plastic wrapper and them being a sticky mess when warm, not to mention I've heard a number of old guys talk about how Charms were quite literally cursed, either certain colors, or the entire pack. As such, they refused to eat them, and sometimes felt even getting them in their bag was bad luck. Maybe this itself speaks to how rare it was to actually get them?

Thus, if it had to be one of those three, the M & M's are certainly not the most interesting; but, perhaps the most enjoyable!

The Chocolate Covered Oatmeal Cookie:

https://preview.redd.it/rkowzge3nthe1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99b1aae1d4e17d8125887bf8f39e92f040f296d1

This is a curious item. Many people, both old hands and modern commentators alike will swear up and down that these things are amazing.

I even can tell you that I have had one of these before that I found much more enjoyable than I did this one for some reason? The reason why is unclear to me at this point. I do remember the one I've already had came out of a Chicken and Rice (1989ish?) a few years ago. I seem to remember that one being amazing in every bite; but, this one, I'm not sure?

In any case, this one was newer, and was fresher. There was not a thing wrong with it, and it tasted very good; but, for whatever reason, I was simply not wowed by it like I was by the lemon pound cake a few weeks ago.

A fair dessert item to be sure, and I'm not going to rate it badly; but, I will be bold and say: ""This isn't quite as good as people keep giving it credit for, and I think thats part of why my expectations were so high it couldn't possibly meet them"".

I could more scientifically say that I believe the modern MRE cookies are not very good, due to them being far too hard, and doing the same thing that captain crunch does to the inside of your mouth as a result if not eaten carefully; but, I would still take one over this due to them being a bit more flavorful and larger. I hope thats a fair judgement that at least someone here will stand by.

We close with the Dessert Beverage, the humble MRE Coffee:

https://preview.redd.it/z8k9ukklothe1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=03f226d0b44d9884393612a2d34a1944de9d163e

When I ate the Spaghetti with Meat and Sauce from 1994, I piled my coffee and cocoa together. This is very normal behavior. But, since there was no cocoa this time, it was fair game to drink as prescribed, and nothing could be done for that.

What is to be said about it? Its an absolutely \*acceptable\* coffee. Some guys love to rave about how good the MRE coffee is; but, honestly, its very average, and everyone knows it. Its not too strong, not too bitter, not too anything. I'd be happy to have it instead of no coffee!

This time around, the tasters choice had not held up quite as well as the last pouch, and took a little more work to get dissolved into the hot water. I decided to only add the creamer and leave the sugar out so I could taste it better. Overall, just a tad on the watery side this time around; but, I think that had a-lot to do with age.

Overall, perfectly fine to drink while eating the crackers and peanut butter, the M and M's, and the chocolate covered cookie. Whether or not it would have been better to have a sugar free drink mix and sugar free sweetener to free up some sugar to be given as a cocoa beverage base is up to you. I think that would have been the tastier, if not less nutritionally balanced, and thus unacceptable, choice, though!

The Gum:

Final note regarding the gum - absolutely acceptable; but, far inferior in comparison to the brand name Chicklets thats were in the 1994 package. Lost it's flavor within minutes and was of a clearly inferior quality. Cheaper for the government? Without a doubt. 

Final Conclusions:

This menu was perfectly fine in every way. Everything aged exceptionally well. Not quite as well as the 1994 Spaghetti with Meat and Sauce meal did due to the noodles going a little stale, the crackers being just a \*tad\* old tasting, and the tasters choice being a bit down on its luck; but, overall it was nearly as well preserved, and I consumed every bit of all the items inside it with no ill effects. Not quite as much of a ""raw carb infusion"" feeling of power came from it as the Spaghetti meal gave me; but, I suppose you should expect that.

The ""enjoyability"" of this menu was hard to really pin down. I think it wasn't bad at all. It can even be said to have tasted very good; but, it didn't ""wow"" me anywhere or give me quite the hit of dopamine that the Spaghetti and Meat Sauce meal did.

Why that is? I'm not sure. I think this menu tried very very hard, and went a long way. Its certainly one of the most exciting meals they had in the MRE lineup of the era, if not \*the\* wildcard of them all; but, it does this at the expense of a-lot of ""synergy"" between the components that were provided for by food science at the time, and thus, somehow loses some ground against the more traditional menus by way of the same items through which it beats them in other ways. The main and noodles are solid; but, there just wasn't much around that paired well with this to make the meal feel ""right"" at the time.

As a result, all in all, I must admit that I understand why this menu eventually was cut in all its forms by the end of 2000. I went into this expecting this menu to completely blow me out of the water, expecting it to make Spaghetti with Meat and Sauce look like something that a 3rd world military force ate; alas, the truth of the matter is that this menu was perfectly fine; but, its just not ""exciting"" nor ""comforting"", and thus can't compete with many of the simpler, yet more beloved menus. In this regard, I believe that Pork Chow Mein might even be similar to the Pizza slice menus. A-lot of promise - a good result - but the expectations simply were so high as to not be possible to meet.

Thats all for this week, guys!

See you next Friday. I'm pretty sure I'll be doing the Corned Beef Hash; but, I'm getting mighty tempted to tear open one of those early 2000s menus and experience one of the meals of the new millennium!

Bouillon powder

I understand the ""best by"" date is really more of a guideline for peak flavor, however I'm looking to extend the life of these foods as far as possible beyond that guideline. If I repackage them, what is the recommended method: mylar? food saver? freezer? glass jars? OAs or desiccants? Short of a freeze dryer -- which I want very badly! -- I have every method of preservation available to me. I just don't know which is best for these specific products. 

The bouillon powder has me the most stumped. I've come across some folks who claim bouillon has an infinite shelf life, but I say hogwash. Bouillon, particularly beef, contains oils and fats (meat) so it will likely go rancid at some point. But in repackaging it, am I trying to keep oxygen out? Or moisture? It seems to me it must be one or the other.

**CHAPTER I**

***La Herradura, El Salvador***

**3-16-99**

A year ago, Javier’s parents started calling his eventual move to the U.S. a ""trip"" and sent him movies and a VHS player for his birthday. He dreams of joining them in California, imagining life with a pool and fruit trees. While surrounded by friends whose parents are already in the U.S. or soon leaving, Javier is the only one at school without both parents. He and his friends fantasize about American life: pizza, McDonald's, and snow.

His parents call regularly, sending pictures, and he feels close despite the distance. Overhearing his grandparents, he learns his trip is near, likely by Mother’s Day. When his aunt, Tía Mali, confirms the date, Javier’s excitement grows, though he's still unsure about the details. He imagines walking across the Golden Gate Bridge and promises never to forget Tía Mali.

**3-17-99**

Javier's parents plan to use Don Dago, a coyote who visits their town yearly, to reach the U.S. Their small, flood-prone town sees Javier and Mali making paper boats during winter floods. Don Dago, known for smuggling people north, sits at Doña Argentina’s cantina, where locals line up for his help. His strict rates are non-negotiable, recorded in a notepad. Javier’s mom used his services, and many others do too. At seven, Javier was denied a U.S. visa for being too young. Don Dago later assured his grandparents he’d take him when ready. Holding onto hope, Javier writes a made-up number atop school assignments to symbolize their savings goal.

**3-20-99**

Javier lies in Mali's bed as she gets ready for a dance and worrying about meeting ""The Dentist."" He reflects on his mom crossing into the U.S., recalling her promise to return. Mali shares how quickly his mom's journey was, and they discuss its dangers. Javier remembers failing to get a U.S. visa with a fake identity as ""Roberto Jr."" Despite his efforts, he never made it. He recalls the disappointment and support from Abuelita and Mali. Mali describes his mom vanishing into the night and seeing snow for the first time. As Mali waits for her ride, they count stars through the skylight and sharing stories.

**3-23-99**

Javier recalls talks with La Chele Gloria, the loud but trusted fruit vendor, about his journey and family history. Despite her gossip and rough speech, she provides comfort and jokes that he shouldn't forget her in the U.S. She tells how Javier’s father secretly left during a war, telling only his own father. As a child, Javier had wandered off after him and caused panic. He was later found by a ceiba tree, waiting for a bus, and scolded by his mother. La Chele Gloria urges Javier to wake up and be ready. Now almost ten, he knows it’s not ""if"" but ""when"" he'll travel with Don Dago.

**3-31-99**

Javier attends “Escuela Parroquial Fray Cosme Spessotto” and is walked to school by his quiet but attentive Grandpa, who ensures he looks neat. At home, Grandpa dresses casually and burns trash, with Javier helping collect coconut casings. Though sober since Javier’s mom left, Javier fears his old habits may return. At school, the strict nuns enforce rules. Javier once got detention for having a ""girlfriend"". He recalls representing his department in a grammar competition, shaking the president’s hand but not placing at the top. Though disappointed, Mali reassures him. His parents, proud of his achievements, send money for treats, but he still strives to impress them. His mom once pushed him academically, using a blackboard for lessons. Javier dreams of excelling in the U.S., proving himself, and avoiding teasing. Mali reminds him the family is already proud.

**4-1-99**

On Jueves Santo, Grandpa and Javier walk through the hot, humid town, passing “Romans” in red skirts and cardboard sandals searching for Jesus. At school, Mother Superior grants Javier permission to miss a week after Grandpa explains his mother sent money for a Guatemala trip. She advises him to catch up on assignments. Back home, they find Don Dago on the porch, asking about Javier’s teeth. Inside, Grandpa, Abuelita, and Don Dago discuss passports, with Don Dago reminding Grandpa not to forget it and promising to call two days before. Outside, Javier hears their talk as the Romans pass by, rattling their matracas.

**4-4-99**

Three days pass with no call from Don Dago. Mali explains coyotes take time to prepare. Javier worries about missing school and the nuns’ reactions. On Viernes Santo, Mali takes him to San Salvador with her ex-boyfriend’s family, visiting Los Planes de Rendero and La Puerta del Diablo. He notices how Don Pablito and Doña Luisita show more affection than his grandparents.

As anxiety grows, The Baker’s son finally announces Don Dago is on the phone. Javier rushes, dropping mangoes, as everyone gathers. Don Dago confirms the trip in two days. Grandpa calls Javier’s parents, who reassure him. Looking at their photos, Javier feels closer to them.

**4-5-99**

On his last day at school, no one knows Javier is leaving. He tells friends he’ll be gone a week and secretly prepares. He gives away his favorite toys, saying his parents wanted him to do something nice. After school, he says goodbye and heads home.

That evening, Javier and Mali reflect on his departure. She asks if he’ll miss his friends, and they look through photo albums, including pictures of his father. Excited yet sad, Javier quietly counts stars with Mali, both feeling the weight of the separation.

**4-6-99**

Javier wakes early as Mali kisses him awake. He showers, dresses in dark clothes per Don Dago’s instructions, and packs a black backpack. Grandpa waits by the door, also packed. Abuelita and Mali help with final preparations, hugging and kissing him goodbye with tears in their eyes. They make the sign of the cross over him. As they leave, Grandpa warns him not to look back, but Javier steals a glance, seeing his family huddled in the doorway before walking away.

**CHAPTER II**

***Tecún Umán, Guatemala***

**4-6-99**

Javier and Grandpa arrive early at the bus terminal and wait for Don Dago, who eventually arrives with six others: two women, a girl, and three men. They board the bus to Guatemala, sitting separately as instructed. As they travel, Javier observes the passengers, including a stern man named Marcelo and a friendly boy, Alejandro. At the border, Grandpa bribes an official to stamp their passports. While waiting, Javier meets Alejandro, a Mexican boy returning home. They continue the journey through Guatemala, passing mountains, lakes, and coffee fields. After a long day, they reach Tecún Umán at night, where a bicitaxi takes them to Don Carlos’s store, their lodging for the night. Don Dago gathers the group, assigns sleeping arrangements, and introduces everyone. Grandpa makes a heartfelt request for the group to look after Javier once he leaves. As the others head to a motel, Javier and Grandpa settle in at Don Carlos’s store, preparing for the next step of their journey.

**4-12-99**

In Tecún Umán, Javier and Grandpa settle into a routine. Grandpa sticks to his grooming habits, while Javier adjusts to using a toilet with his support. They eat meals at Don Carlos’s store, with food brought by Don Dago. Marcelo and Chele keep to themselves, while Patricia, Carla, and Chino stay together. The group’s stay extends beyond two days due to delays, frustrating some, though Don Dago insists it's for their safety. Grandpa privately discusses plans with him and teaches Javier their travel route and fake Mexican identities. At night, they explore town, seeing Marcelo and Chele smoking and Los Soyas laughing. Rumors spread about Marta and Don Dago. Javier reflects on identity after hearing Grandpa use ""indio"" with disdain. He learns more about Grandpa’s past as a soldier and policeman than ever before. Evenings end with TV before lights-out, with Grandpa promising calls home, though they've only called once.

**4-19-99**

Marcelo snaps, yelling at Don Dago and throwing a tortilla over the delays. Don Dago insists things are fine, but frustration grows. Marcelo refuses to pay the rest of his fee, and Javier learns the journey is paid in installments. Grandpa reassures him their payment is covered but worries about their permits expiring. To distract Javier, Grandpa tells stories. Later, Jesús takes him to the arcade. Grandpa gives him money and safety rules. Jesús impresses Javier with his confidence and skills. On the way back, Jesús points to Mexico across the river, saying he’ll cross soon. That evening, Grandpa learns Javier leaves the next day. They celebrate with Pollo Campero, then call his parents and Abuelita. His parents are excited, but Abuelita and Mali are emotional. On the walk back, Grandpa comforts him, and Javier realizes how much he’ll miss him.

**4-20-99**

Javier and the group prepare to leave, backpacks ready. Don Dago collects the motel keys and tells them to wait. Grandpa checks Javier’s things, giving him extra supplies. Bicitaxis arrive, and Jesús fist-bumps Javier before they reach the small bus. Everyone boards, but Javier lingers. Grandpa, holding back tears, blesses him, tells him to trust Marcelo, and reminds him a cadejo will protect him. Javier hugs Grandpa, says he loves him, then boards. As the bus pulls away, he watches Grandpa wave until he disappears. Holding back tears, he stares out the window at the banana trees, searching for the red eyes of his cadejo.

**Interesting Tid-bits**:

- [Pupusas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupusa) are a traditional Salvadoran dish made from corn dough and filled with a variety of ingredients, like cheese, beans, pork, or zucchini. This dish is so iconic that El Salvador even celebrates National Pupusa Day every second Sunday in November.

- El Salvador has [a long history of migration](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/el-salvador-civil-war-natural-disasters-and-gang-violence-drive-migration), and many Salvadorans have made the difficult journey to the U.S. for economic opportunities or to reunite with family. The concept of ""the trip"" in the story reflects this, as many Salvadorans leave their homes in search of a better life, just like the Javier’s parents.
- El Salvador is known as “[**La Tierra de Volcanes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhP1zUgLZis)” (**the Land of Volcanoes) because it has more than 20 volcanoes.
- Characters like Tía Mali use words like ""[tontito](https://tureng.com/en/spanish-english/%C2%A1tontito!)"" (a playful term for ""silly"" or ""foolish"") and ""[fijáte](https://theamericanscholar.org/fijate/)"" (a Salvadoran expression meaning ""look at that"" or ""imagine that""). Salvadorans often use informal and endearing language that reflects their warmth and sense of community.
- Gangs, especially the [Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-13), are a significant issue in El Salvador. Many young people, including the character Papel-con-Caca, face dangers from violence and gangs.
- In El Salvador, “[marañón trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cashew)"" (cashew trees) grow in abundance, and the nut itself is a popular snack. The fruit (known as ""marañón"" in Spanish) is also used to make juices or preserved as jams.
- Walking in religious processions and acting out scenes like ""Los Romanos"" (The Romans) searching for Jesus is a key part of Salvadoran culture, especially during [Semana Santa](https://elsalvadorinfo.net/holy-week-in-el-salvador/) (Holy Week), a time filled with parades, re-enactments, and community gatherings.
- [Matracas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratchet_(instrument)) are traditional wooden rattles used during religious festivities like **Semana Santa** in El Salvador.
- Many Salvadorans still believe in witches and spirits, as seen when Mali worries about looking like a [bruja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft_in_Latin_America).
- The [cadejo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadejo) is a supernatural spirit that appears as a dog-shaped creature with blue eyes when it is calm and red eyes when it is attacking.
- [Pollo Campero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollo_Campero) is Central America’s answer to KFC,originating from Guatemala. The chain has grown internationally and even has a presence in the U.S. today.
- [Telenovelas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenovela), like [*Luz Clarita*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luz_Clarita) (I watched this one also when I was younger!) are an important part of Latin American culture. The term *telenovela* literally means ""television novel"" and has been a staple of Latin American TV for decades.
- In Guatemala and other parts of Central America, [*bicitaxis*](https://www.guatevision.com/historico/bicitaxis-una-alternativa-transporte) are a common form of transport, especially in smaller towns.
- El Salvador is often referred to as ""[El Pulgarcito de América](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Pulgarcito_de_Am%C3%A9rica)"" (Americas' Little Thumb) due to its small size compared to the rest of Central America.",2,1738981136.0,bookclub,15,1.0,False
1ikcj6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ikcj6c/cutting_down_on_caffeine_after_psychiatry/,Cutting Down on Caffeine After Psychiatry Appointment," Hi. I started university this year. I used to drink coffee HEAVILY. I'd drink it at mornings, at the campus, when I come back home, after dinner and before sleeping. It was an addiction of mine. Since I was diagnosed to have ADHD around 2020-2021, and my meds ran out since I changed cities, I decided to schedule an appointment with one of the psychiatrists here. I told him everything I could think of and turns out that on top of ADHD I also have very light OCD and god damn derealization which I wasn't surprised to hear because I've been suffering from it since I was give or take 7. The psychiatrist explicitly told me to either drink decaf coffee or don't go above once or twice a day.

 Now, I was scared at first. I am generally very tired even after waking up from a 17-hour sleep and I thought coffee was all that's keeping me awake. Turns out it isn't. For the first day or two of reducing myself to only one cup of coffee, I'd usually get itching feelings to just go brew myself a new one but it disappeared over time. I also cut down heavily on carbonated drinks safe for mineral water. I feel AWESOME right now.

 Am I still tired? Yes. Am I tired because I'm not having caffeine just slam jammed into my veins at every given second? No. Coffee is so god damn addicting and binding that once you start using it you fear that if you let go of it you'll be ""a shell of your former self"" and ""snooze all the time"" when it's generally the opposite.

 I also want this wall of text to be a call for act to everyone reading it. Get up from your computer, prepare a small backpack and go out for a walk for at least an hour. Let the fresh air just enter your lungs freely, completely safe from the panic of being late to anything you might have planned. Just walk wherever you want. You want a natural ""wake up"" hormone? That's what you'll get from that walk. You'll feel more and more alive each day you take a walk. Let your body wake you up, not some ground beans or god knows what.

**Above the Forward Edge of the Battle Area**  
**Kiangsu Province, Federal Republic of China**

From airfields across Federal Chinese territory, hundreds of COD warplanes took off into the night sky and headed northwards to their objectives.

Ten years ago, Matt would be the tip of the spear, chasing enemy fighters around like hapless turkeys before the bombers arrived.

Now older and wiser, he wasn’t allowed to do it anymore; not because of pesky things like health conditions or age limit, but because post-World War Two FCAF regulations forbade flag officers from flying combat missions.

“Who’s going to run the Air Force if you maniacs all ended up dead or worse?” were supposedly the words of Madame Marilyn Chiang, former Minister of the Air Force and current Minister of Foreign Affairs.

As the saying went, however, rules were made to be broken, and no one embodied the rebelliousness and casual disregard for rigid command structures better than the Four Heavenly Kings of the Air Force.

True to form, they began to find workarounds.

Generals Charles Chih-hang Kao, GOC Air Combat Command, Gideon Kwei-tan Lee, GOC Strike Command, and Tristan Tsui-kang Liu, GOC Capital Air Defence Command, followed regulations to the letter. At the same time , they would often sneak out of their offices and fly non-combat aircrafts like the Avro Athlone and Douglas Dumbarton in support of combat missions, or patrol the skies on Hawker Hunters so far behind the lines there was almost no chance for the enemy to reach them.

Colonel Edan Yi-chin Yueh, OC 2nd Fighter Wing, went the other way; he steadfastly refused promotion and kept on flying. The brass was understandably annoyed, but with 99 confirmed air-to-air kills since 1937, Yueh was a national hero with plenty of friends in both Chambers of the National Assembly, and so he was left alone.

Major General Matthew Ming-chun Cheng, GOC 18th Bomber Group, simply ignored regulations and hopped onto his English Electric Nottingham, the *Tientsin Tina*, whenever they were assigned a mission, daring the brass to ground him.

It wasn’t as if they lacked reasons to ground him: his brother Ming-wei, for one, was the incumbent Deputy Minister of Industry in the PRC government; his sister Ming-li, for another, was the wife of General Cheng Zhihua of the RMJ, DGOC Central Plains Front.

Ugh, thinking about his surviving family in the North gave him headaches.

“Bob! Still got that tea of yours?” he asked his co-pilot.

“It’s called ‘yuen-yeung’, sir,” Captain Robert Ho, III handed over the thermos while correcting him. “How many times do I gotta tell you that?”

“Whatever,” Matt loved the Hongkonger drink, made from mixing equal parts coffee and tea. “Hmmmm, what’d you use this time? Not Ceylonese, I know that for sure.”

“Yunnanese, because Jonas wouldn’t shut up about it,” Bob said with mocked annoyance.

“Hawk Lead to Hawk Two, come in, over,” Matt went on the radio.

“*Hawk Two, go ahead, over,*” Captain Jonas Tsung-ming Tsai answered from *Pu’erh Paula*, currently on their starboard.

“Thanks for the leaf, Hawk Two. It was good.”

“*My pleasure, sir. Have you given any thoughts to the proposal?*”

The proposal was about a beverage company - specialising in tea, obviously - where the entire 18th Group from pilots to mechanics would be shareholders. There was no shortage of interested persons, but it needed an initial infusion of capital to get things started.

Naturally, Matt and Bob, both scions of prominent families, became Jonas’ main focus in his recruitment campaign.

“The answer is the same, Captain Tsai: I’ll let you know if I don’t die. Hawk Lead, out.” Matt signed off and turned to Bob. “Persistent little shit, isn’t he?”

“Persistent enough that I’m inclined to say yes,” Bob nodded.

“You looked at the plan?”

“I did. Did you?”

“Yeah, ” Matt took a deep breath and made his decision. “Ah, what the hell, I’ll need a new job when this is over.”

Bob pumped his fist in the air.

“But,” Matt added. “If we’re doing this, we’re gonna do it right. I’m bringing Madame Chiang on board. We can use the backing, financially or otherwise.”

“No arguments from me.”

That was the moment when the radio came to life.

“*Tallyho, tallyho! Multiple bandits, eleven o’clock! Red Leader, engaging!*” a Szechuan-accented voice called out.

“Go get’em, Steinway,” Matt, at 31 confirmed kills, said with a hint of envy.

“You think he’s gonna get his 100th kill?” Bob asked.

“He won’t stop trying, that’s for sure,” Matt commented before going on the radio. “Hawk Lead to all Hawks, watch your spacing. Be ready to take evasive actions.”

In a world where AI developments are galloping forward like they've been fed a double espresso, regulators are being urged to pick up the pace. Recent conversations highlight the urgent need for governments to ensure that technological progress is matched by robust oversight and regulation.

The emergence of AI has left many industry experts with furrowed brows and high-stacked coffee cups as they scramble to address the implications of this technological evolution. The growing concern isn't just about the sheer capabilities AI brings—ranging from tangible tools like data center management to abstract applications like consciousness theory—but also about the energy it consumes and societal impact.

Some voices in the tech realm are calling for mandatory energy-use reporting by companies running data centers. Apparently, transparency is as fashionable in Silicon Valley as the latest gadget. Simultaneously, tech giants like Google are under the spotlight for their evolving stance on using AI in warfare, a decision that has left some technophiles feeling more than a little uneasy.

And while AI is celebrated for its achievements, such as helping researchers read ancient, charred scrolls, it's not without its controversies. From edited Super Bowl ads that spread misinformation to potential threats to national security leading to bans, AI's reputation is as complex as a Dickens novel.

But the ultimate question rests on the precipice of the unknown: Are we prepared for a world where AI not only predicts our needs but potentially joins us at the decision-making table? And what would that mean for the autonomy of our human-led institutions?

As society and AI continue to tango, the future remains a fascinating and challenging question mark. What role should AI play in our lives, and how much control over it should we aim to harness?",1,1738980300.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

NMSU’s Physical Science Laboratory recently launched an innovative program aimed at enhancing defense capabilities through artificial intelligence. The Defense Leadership Certificate Program, powered with the ambitious tagline “Improving Developmental Testing with Artificial Intelligence,” marks a concerted effort to bridge skills gaps in the defense sector.

Imagine combining the charm of Netflix’s “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina” with defense protocols—that’s the kind of engaging curriculum this program offers. The initiative, which concluded with Shark Tank-style presentations, is more than just academic theory. It brought together representatives from six major U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command centers, pushing the envelope in AI’s potential applications.

What makes this program especially exciting is its immersive learning experience, combining both online modules and hands-on sessions. Participants are thrust into the nitty-gritty of AI applications, guided by industry experts like retired Army Col. Ross Davidson. According to Brig. Gen. George Turner, this project is not just about keeping pace with technology but staying ahead, making it as essential as coffee on a Monday morning.

But wait, there’s more! The Defense Leadership Certificate Program is only the beginning. Come 2025, new courses like “AI for Defense Applications” and “Technical Writing” will expand the curriculum. This forward-thinking approach is not just about the Department of Defense but extends to NMSU’s commitment to developing talent at every educational stage. Josh Moon, who leads these student programs, ensures that NMSU is not only educating learners but transforming them into pioneers ready to tackle tomorrow’s challenges.

So, as the AI boom continues to reshape industries, how should we think about the balance between innovation and security? Will initiatives like these suffice to keep global security a step ahead of potential threats?",1,1738980169.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

My husband works a full-time job, while I work part-time during the mornings and early afternoons. I bring my kids along with me, and I also recently took on a second job at night (WFH) to help bring in extra income.

The issue is, I feel completely overwhelmed, and it's been building up. I do all the cooking, cleaning, and take care of the kids. I even pack my husband's lunches and make his coffee every morning before work. Meanwhile, he gets to drive to work by himself, in peace and quiet, while I juggle my kids. In the evenings, he goes to gym classes alone while I'm home, putting the kids to bed, and I rarely get any time for myself. In his defense, he has to maintain a certain level of fitness as he is trying to advance his career.


I'm feeling frustrated and resentful because I'm handling everything at home while also managing my two jobs. I don't feel like I'm getting the support I need, and it's really taking a toll on my mental health. I've tried talking to him about how I'm feeling, but it doesn't seem to make a difference.

Instead of helping with chores, he says the house looks great and that I shouldn't put so much pressure on myself. He will occasionally vacuum and help with dishes. I have asked for help with tasks, or even if we could do it together to help spreed up the process. 

We haven't had a date night in months, and we've only had three date nights in total since our first child was born. He says it's mostly finances, but a picnic in the park is cheap. He says I won’t be satisfied with a picnic date, so it’s not even worth the effort. 

He is very hardworking and tries his best, and I can tell that he's overwhelmed, too, but I'm starting to resent him more and more.

My wife and I have been steadily at each others throats here lately and by at each other’s throats I mean her yelling and screaming, pushing me, throwing things, heck she ripped a shirt off herself in some kind of rage this morning in the middle of berating me but here’s some back story to it. 

So about a while back I needed to use my wife’s Gmail for our company’s trip logs. After downloading the trip logs I came across some old trips in the logs that didn’t add up so I got suspicious and I won’t deny that it sent me on the hunt. During this hunt I found out that over these many years my wife had secret conversations with other men, specifically one man. She made trips up to the exact house where the other man was in several occasions in the guise that she was helping her cousin or seeing her brother which btw lives with the other man and not to mention the extra hour and a half she would take at the end of her work day to drive up there to help her cousin or see her brother or whatever else the excuse was that I didn’t second guess at the time, but now I feel like I should have and I’m just a huge fool. Now we can’t stop fighting and I’ve let it go, like literally don’t care because she’s all I wanted at that time. 

Two days ago I spent 12 hours on a job repiping a mobile home. It was cold, it was wet, and it was full of insulation because it was a mobile home. But either way I was on that job and slammed it out solo that day other than I found a broke valve that I would have to return for. Anyways I messaged the home owner directly to inform them that I would be done around 9pm and which I was done at 9pm but still had to load up and clean up and I never got the chance to clean up. I loaded up and left out around 9:30pm ish. By the time I get from this customers house to the nearest town it’s a 30 minute drive alone. So I stopped off at Waffle House to clean up in the bathroom and grab a hot coffee and a bacon cheesesteak melt. Good stuff btw. Anyways I left there after eating what I could. My house is 30 minutes away and I grabbed gas on my way in so by the time I get home it’s around 10:40. She’s messaged me already saying “ Please be quiet whenever you decide to come home. Oh, and don't give me the crap you're working. The job was allotted two days, and you are choosing not to come home whether you are still on the job or not. “ 
I ignored it and took a bath and went to bed. 

The next morning I wake up around 7 I’ve got to find a valve that’s busted and or put shutoffs in line before I have to meet the customer at 9 to sign off on the job. I laid in bed for a good 30 minutes and when I got up I had a 7:45 alarm about to go off. I grab my phone walk to the bathroom to pee drop my phone while trying to turn off the alarm and not pee on myself  while I’m half asleep. 🙃

As I’m standing in the bathroom I hear her from the background very lightly like a whisper about why I’m being so suspicious by taking my phone in the bathroom with me???!??!?? Like wtf? And that’s exactly what I said to her. “ What the fuck? “ I proceeded to get dressed and go to work. When I got home that afternoon I started to move my stuff downstairs to another one of my bedrooms on the other side of the house.

For the last two days I’ve separated myself from her the best that I could, I can’t take her screaming at me anymore. She literally got her lips in my ear and screamed as loud as she could because I told her I wanted to divorce because I can’t obviously separate away from her. I moved all of my belongings and clothes to the other end of the house and she decided to move all of her belongings to the now same side I just moved all of my stuff too. All the while continued to yell at me and screamed at me. I’ve done my best to stand my ground about the separation but I’ve also been normal towards her and she can’t seem to treat me like a normal person. As if I ask her something it has some kind of tone with it. I’m not pointing any of this out anymore for if I do it’s another broken solid core door from her, or another hole in my Sheetrock.

1ikc44g,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/1ikc44g/when_medications_didnt_help/,When medications didn't help,"Hi everyone, I'm brand new to this thread but wanted to share what brought me into clinical remission.

I was diagnosed with UC about 12 years ago when I had my first real flare. After a colonoscopy, I was prescribed mesalamine and was told I would have to take it indefinitely to control the inflammation. This was unacceptable to me. As an engineer, I wanted to find the root cause and to get rid of the problem at its source.

I spent years learning about nutritions, seeing multiple nutritionist, trying to manage my anxiety and stress, and trying to learn about alternative medicine. There is also an incredibly strong tie between mental health and gut related issues but they are extremely difficult to quantify due to the vast quantity and types of bacteria in the human body. 

I used a trial and error method for years trying to figure out what to include in or cut out of my life. I've had flares that lasted between 3-9 months with the worst of which being hospitalized and the prescribed steroids doing absolutely nothing. Prior to that, Rawasa enemas were life savers and I usually saw improvement within a few days depending on the severity. Once the affected area reached past the sigmoid colon, I needed to find another solution.

Long story short, here's what actually helped:

SSRIs - Stress and anxiety were absolutely my main triggers and reeked havoc on my body. I tried multiple SSRIs but landed on Lexipro. This has helped tapper off the smaller flares. PSA, do NOT take NSAIDs with SSRIs. This was never mentioned to me but it is what landed me in the hospital. Do some research about this if you want to learn more but it is known to cause issues.

Restore Liver Function - I drank a lot in college and afterwards (depression and genetic alcoholism). Cutting out alcohol to help my liver recover and to reduce the intake of sugars reduced my flare up frequency. Once I was down to like 4 bowel movements a day, I started drinking coffee. Every morning, I would french press coffee with ground up dark chocolate (cacoa nibs) and cinnamon. These are all great for the liver and inflammation. This is a sustaining measure that has helped immensely.

THC - low mg THC seltzers was a game changer to manage my minor flare symptoms (gurgly bowles that don't quite lead to gas - I'm sure you all know the feeling). I would drink 2-3mg of THC seltzer and I would usually find relief from it with a few hours. I tried smoking and edibles as well but they didn't seem to work in the same manner. Higher doses of THC for me usually didn't help as I would tend to eat more and usually more junk food.

Qing Dai - I've been following this Chinese herb for years and it seems that there are finally some really good research papers and studies out there confirming the efficacy. I have yet to find anything that is covered by insurance but I use (a certain brand that this sub won't allow - research Qing Dai) and I HIGHLY recommend looking into them and trying it out. I felt relief within a day after trying steroids for weeks with no improvement. This was the only thing that helped my severe flare up.

Sleep - I've realized I need much more sleep than the average person for my body to be restored. I've started to listen to my body and make sure I go to bed early so I can get the proper amount of sleep. When I go to bed late or don't get enough sleep, I am much more susceptible to minor symptoms, as well as anxiety, worsening everything.

Exercise - this is an obvious one and also a bit of an oxymoron because when you flare you can't exercise. The only thing I'd like to add is to not exercise too hard. Stress, both mental and physical, causes your body to react similarly. After a very intense game of basketball I would be struggling to recover for hours afterwords and my body would become stressed

Nutrition - so many doctors and nutritionists told me I can eat whatever I want with UC as long as I take my meds. That never made sense to me. I tried cutting out gluten, red meat, poultry, sugars, was a vegetarian, and vegan to see what helped. There was no noticable difference with any of those. What I did notice, was that whenever I ate processed foods, that's when things didn't feel right. Take the time to make food. Yes, going out for food is a struggle... But finding a few restaurants that work can make all the difference. Cutting processed foods and high sugar food (fast food, americanized Chinese food, etc). Most authentic restaurants that serve Chinese, Thai, japanese, Mexican, will not have processed foods and will also help heal your gut. Additionally, my body needs a lot of D3 vitamin. So I take D3 supplement and K complex to help its absorption. 

Happiness and positivity - it is amazing how a positive outlook and happiness can drive how your body responds. My happiness and ments of pure Bliss come from my dogs. Find something that makes you happy and allow yourself to fully be in the present, even just for a moment. Eliminate sources of stress best you can. And go outside, fresh air is amazing to detox your mind!

This has been my journey and it will be different for everyone! I hope that someone will read something here that they didn't know or didn't think of and I helps them with this disruptive disease. Just because it's not life threatening, doesn't mean that it doesn't threaten your livelihood. Listen to your body and it may teach your brain a thing or two.

1ikc3ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1ikc3ks/the_flash_super_hero_or_my_mother_in_laws_snatch/,"The Flash: Super hero, or my mother in law’s snatch?","There was a post yesterday about someone accidentally seeing their mother-in-law with her pants down. I was thoroughly enjoying the discussion—chuckling, cringing, sharing my own tales of ocular trauma—when OP suddenly deleted their post, and the conversation died. (I assume OP died of humiliation. RIP OP. You were too pure for this world.)

But since I’m an irreverent bastard with a dark sense of humor—and I seem to exist in a family with all the boundaries of a feral nudist commune—I’m resurrecting the conversation with my own story.

I have seen my mother-in-law’s vagina so many times that if her labia ever committed a felony, I could whip up a police sketch from memory while the forensics team took lunch. Not a rough estimate. Not an abstract impressionist rendering. A hyper-accurate, courtroom-admissible, dead-to-rights portrait of her particular pelvic geography. At this point, I could be called as an expert witness in The Case of MIL’s Perpetually Uncaged Beaver.

I have seen the entire birthplace of my wife from angles that even NASA would struggle to document. If the James Webb Telescope ever needs guidance on optimal positioning to capture a deep-field image of my MIL’s nether regions, I could charge a consulting fee. Front view? Check. Side profile? You bet. Reverse aerial, framed by the glow of the refrigerator light while I was just trying to get a snack? Oh, it’s happened. I have logged more mental flight hours over this particular terrain than the U.S. Geological Survey.

How does this keep happening? Well, in 2020, my wife and I bought a nice little house—perfect for two. By 2022, my mother-in-law had purchased a home just three doors down. This was a mistake. Because instead of spending time in her house, she simply migrated to ours. If you think this would lead to normal family bonding moments over coffee and casual visits, you are wildly underestimating her commitment to both convenience and flashing her gash.

Now, you might be thinking, “Well, surely she wears clothes?” Oh, you sweet summer child.

She wears bathrobes. But not cozy, grandmotherly, Little House on the Prairie nightgowns. No. Her robes are the kind that high-end spas give you when they expect you to only wear them for 45 seconds between the steam room and a deep tissue massage. And guess what? They never fully close. Ever. It’s like a “Choose Your Own Adventure” book, except every ending leads to an unsolicited eyeful of vagina.

And before you ask—yes, she does steal these robes from the spas. Which means I am being visually assaulted and morally compromised in the same breath.

So what’s the big deal? A little casual nudity? Europeans do it all the time! Maybe I’m just a prudish American?

Well, here’s the thing. She helps with the kids. Which is great. She bathes them at the end of the day, which is a genuinely helpful act of service. The only problem is that she often decides to just hop in the bath with them. If you’ve never considered the full existential horror of the word with in this context, I envy you.

We have a household phrase for this. When Grandma joins the kids in the bath, we say they’re “swimming in the forest.” The forest is thick. The forest is dark. The forest is an ancestral crime scene that no man should have to witness. And sometimes, despite our best efforts, the forest arrives unexpectedly.

Picture this: The kids are dried off. Grandma is back in her robe, now sitting in the living room with the baby on her lap. The baby gets sleepy, starts sucking on his bottle. But—whoopsie!—the bottle drops and rolls under the couch. The dog comes running to lap up the milk.

Now, at this moment, I am six feet away, pouring myself a drink, minding my own business. I hear the “whoopsie.” I turn my head.

And that’s when Grandma drops to all fours to retrieve the bottle.

Her hips tilt anteriorly, her spine aligns, and the robe parts like the Red Sea (which, now that I think about it, is probably the worst analogy to use here—thank God for menopause). It is an all-access backstage pass to a concert I never bought tickets for. At this precise moment, I realize I am bearing witness to an advanced demonstration of the Reverse Cowgirl—a position I had only previously encountered in instructional diagrams and one deeply regrettable viewing of Wild Things 2.

I have been visually assaulted by this woman’s anatomy so many times I am starting to suspect she’s doing it on purpose.

And look, I wouldn’t say that lightly. But there are some facts we need to examine here.
	1.	Her son—my brother-in-law—has complained about this too. He has also been an unwilling witness to The Great Divide. This is a systemic issue.
	2.	She has never once had a wardrobe malfunction up top. Not once. Not even a rogue areola. If this were just a case of someone being too comfortable with their body, surely we’d get a stray boob every now and then? But no. It’s only the undercarriage.
	3.	She reacts to her own flashing with a performative lack of shame. Sometimes she’ll do a little faux-curtsy, like a burlesque performer who’s just revealed the grand finale. Other times, she’ll pull a “Who, me?!” as if the concept of modesty is a foreign custom she read about once in a book.

It’s like she read Plato’s The Cave and thought, Yes. That is my new identity. Only instead of allegorical enlightenment, she’s chosen full-throttle, uninhibited pubic disclosure as her guiding philosophy.

And this happens. Every. Single. Week.

So what have I learned?

Nothing, except that I am one more unsolicited eyeful away from developing an aneurysm. And that no matter how much I try to avert my eyes, the forest always finds me.",2,1738979773.0,daddit,1,0.63,False

I'm new to reddit but I thought this would be a good place to ask for tips and just talk to other people with my condition.

I've always been a sleepy person. A nap was practically a mandatory part of my daily schedule in high school/early college because of it. Now that I finally have a diagnosis and have been bouncing between medications, I've come to realize my chronic fatigue is part of my adhd. I haven't really found a medication/dosage that has really worked 100% yet which is annoying but with every medication I've tried so far, the common symptom curer I've experienced is actually feeling awake during the day. Which is so amazing I just gotta say.

I guess my current issue is being down to my last 2 pills of Amphetamine when I'm currently having issues with my prescription at the pharmacy (for some reason my prescription isn't showing up with them and I haven't been able to contact my doctor). I forgot how bad my chronic fatigue was until now. I really only take my meds when I need it for school so its never bothered me much until now, but it's just so frustrating overall. I got a lot of sleep last night, 9pm to 4am, then from 7am to 10am. But I'm sitting here trying to do work and I just feel so exhausted.  
  
 I guess I'm just asking for advice. Coffee tends to hurt my stomach, but I drink a lot of tea and I don't mind going back to energy drinks for a bit. Or is caffeine not even the direction I should be going? I'd like any sort of engagement even if its a ""been there"" sorta response",1,1738979401.0,ADHD,2,1.0,False

When I started feeling the burn in my stomach, I immediately took my trusty Nexium. Usually I heal in 2-4 weeks, but this time it seemed like I would feel healed, then the next few days I would have flareups of bloating, belching, rib pain that radiates all over my body, and lots of anxiety. It kind of seemed like the burn in my stomach was gone, but it was hard to tell because the body aches were causing a burning feeling in my chest. (It feels like a myalgia).

Yesterday, just shy of 6 weeks, I decided to quit the Nexium to see if my problems were from side-effects. Today it was all gone. The bloating, the belching, the pain, the anxiety. I even had a tiny bit of coffee, a small piece of chocolate, and a diet cola Sevia, and no problems.

That never happened in the past when I took Nexium. I would get the side-effects, but they would go away while I was still taking the Nexium, and that's when I knew I was healed.

Only possible explanations I can think of is I was more active this time (also did some heavy lifting), which increased the body aches, which cascaded into making me more anxious. Or I was deficient in some nutrient. Either way, I'm glad it's over! I made a note on next year's calendar to NOT get gastritis again.",8,1738979281.0,Gastritis,3,1.0,False

I have literally zero complaints. I started playing towards the end of the brat update, so it's been a few months. 

I don't think I've ever enjoyed playing a game this much. I play an hour daily, and it's how I de-stress. I have played every single day since I found this game. I'm genuinely so excited, waiting for the new update. It's all I can think about, so I thought I would share the love I have for this game.

I've heard that Tetris helps with PTSD. Similarly, I think this game has a very healthy impact on my mood. It's very relaxing/calming to me. Even when I'm having a bad day, playing the game helps me calm down. It actually makes me feel positive. 

I know people say the game players are toxic. I personally don't see much of that inside the game tbh. I just see kids with lame insults, and I just take it as kids being kids. I do see negative opinions on this sub, but I usually just don't care since I love everything about this game.

The main point is that I don't take it too seriously. If an item gets removed, I don't much mind. Similarly, at first, it was hard to navigate when the dressing rooms were introduced, but I personally didn't mind. The Halloween update had me so excited, I was just happy creating outfits tbh. 

I do get slightly annoyed by rigged voting, but I just enjoy creating outfits, and if no one likes them, I am proud of them anyway. 

I liked logging in for the petal dress, and also really loved the Advent calendar. So much that I really want something like that again. It was super fun logging in every morning with a cup of coffee in hand to see what I would get! 

I also enjoyed working for the trendsetter dress, even though I never use it anymore. I hope they add a different dress for each rank. I would adore having that little incentive to rank up. Otherwise, I don't much care. I have not cared about ranks since I got the Trendsetter dress tbh.

I know the sub is soon going to be flooded after the update drops, so I just want to share my love before that :) 

I already know I'm going to love everything. I trust the devs, and personally think they are giving us everything we want and more. Can't wait to run around, making myself familiar with the new map, trying on all the new stuff and game modes. 

I'm soo excited. It's all I talk about. My 15-year-old lil sis was the one who sort of introduced me to the game, but now she has moved on from the game so she just rolls her eyes at me lol.

I’m most of the time secured at myself but there are times whenever I get to see articles or reels about dating, I wonder if I’m being strung along esp on days na we don’t get to talk (I just think na ok bayan muna talaga)

My grandma made all these. She said a friend of hers had converted her garage into a long arm quilting machine, so that’s where that part happened, but all the rest happened in her back room. She loved making quilts, baking pies, and watching the Packers. She walked by the lake every morning and went to quilt camp every summer. She made a quilt for every birth, wedding, or major life event. There were 200+ left over when she died, and she told us never to sell any of them. We gave them all away. Some went to family, others to friends, and one is hanging in the front entrance to the quilt camp she loved. 

My wife knew she was truly a member of the family when my grandma secreted her away to the upstairs rooms where she kept her stock and let my then fiancé pick out our wedding quilt. That’s the giant blue one, called The General’s Wives. The little blue one will be for our youngest, and there’s a bright pink and green one upstairs on our oldest’s bed. They never met their great-grandmother but I get to see her with them every day now. The rag quilt was one of her favorites. It rarely left a trundle bed that was always mine when I stayed there. A week in the storm room, listening to the lake critters, bull frogs droning on, wrapped in the quilt, waking to the sound and smell of her coffee cake in the kitchen; I wrap myself in those memories whenever I wrap myself in that quilt. 

So this is why I love quilts. She and my grandpa had to be making something all the time. My grandpa painted and had an old International Scout he would tinker with. They gave my dad the tools he needed to know he could make whatever he set his mind to, and now those tools are mine. I skip around craft to craft, trying this and that, but it’s all because of them. The quilt ladder is one I made, based on the one my grandpa made for her, to show off whatever she was most proud of at the time. There wasn’t a wall in their house not occupied by some quilted thing apropos to the season or holiday or sporting event.

I want a real relationship that exists outside of the confines of the internet —late-night conversations, coffee runs that turn into deep discussions, and road trips where your hand finds my thigh without a second thought. You should be extroverted, left-leaning (or at the very least, not the kind of guy who thinks “staying out of politics” is a personality trait), and 100% single—as in, actually over your ex.

# The Coca-Cola Company Financial Summary

The Coca-Cola Company reported its [third quarter 2024](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_2cc469ae77153f58486b0c053936cf58/cocacolacompany/db/734/8154/earnings_release/2024+Q3+Earnings+Release+%28Ex-99.1%29+-+FINAL.pdf) results , showing resilience and a solid strategy despite a challenging environment. During the quarter, unit case volume decreased 1%, while net revenue fell 1%. However, organic (non-GAAP) revenue grew 9%, driven by a 10% increase in price/mix and a 2% decrease in concentrate sales.

# Highlights:

* **Revenue Performance:** Net revenue decreased 1% to $11.9 billion, but organic (non-GAAP) revenue grew 9%.
* **Operating Margin:** Operating margin was 21.2%, compared to 27.4% in the prior year. Comparable non-GAAP operating margin was 30.7%, up from 29.7% in the prior year.
* **Earnings per Share (EPS):** EPS decreased 7% to $0.66, while comparable (non-GAAP) EPS increased 5% to $0.77.
* **Cash Flow:** Cash flow from operations was $2.9 billion, impacted by a $6.0 billion payment to the IRS for tax litigation. Without this payment, non-GAAP free cash flow would have been $7.6 billion, a decrease of $294 million compared to the prior year.

# Projections for 2024

* **Organic Revenue Growth:** Organic revenue growth (non-GAAP) is expected to be 10%, with a negative impact of 5% due to foreign exchange factors.
* **EPS:** Comparable (non-GAAP) EPS is projected to grow 5% to 6%, compared to $2.69 in 2023.
* **Currency Impact:** Currency effects are anticipated to reduce EPS growth by approximately 9%.
* **Free Cash Flow:** Estimated at approximately $9.2 billion, excluding payment to IRS.

# Key Statistics 

The Coca-Cola Company continues to establish itself as a leader in the non-alcoholic beverage industry, with a market capitalization of $272.47 billion USD and a well-established global presence. The company maintains a solid valuation in the market, reflected in its P/E ratio of 26.03 and a basic EPS (TTM) of $2.41 USD .

Its strategy of returning capital to shareholders continues to balance reinvestment in innovation and expansion with the distribution of profits through dividends. This underlines the company's financial stability and its focus on sustainable growth.

# Summary

The Coca-Cola Company, often considered a defensive stock, stands out as a solid and reliable investment choice, especially in times of economic uncertainty. Its leading position in the beverage industry, a globally recognized brand, and a consistent history of dividend performance are key factors that contribute to its reputation as a safe haven for investors.

Coca-Cola’s product diversification, focus on adaptability and innovation, and ability to maintain a strong global presence reinforce its resilience in a competitive market. In addition, its commitment to sustainability and corporate social responsibility enhances its appeal among investors aware of the social and environmental impact of their investments.

We had been friends for years and old colleagues. M and F (29)

I know we're both single and looking for people and both on the apps and we never had a romantic vibe before but I was into it. Nothing sexual happened that night and we just cuddled and slept together and kissed a couple times and it was a sweet night. The next day he made me coffee and drove me home and I suggested we should go on a real date sometime and he said yes.

I didn't hear from him at all via text but ran into him through work circles a few days later where the conversation was friendly and he said that we should grab drinks the upcoming weekend or next.  
I had to travel the following week and I still hadn't gotten a text from him so I decided to just text him. We agreed to hang when I came back, followed up when I got back but then he got sick and couldn't that weekend. But just to gauge his interest level, I sent a nice text suggesting that I did have a really great time last time and I wanted to do it again when he was up for it. He loved the message.

So finally, I just wanted to get some clarity. I knew we were going to be at the same event coming up so I brought up at the end of the night how he was feeling about things since it's been a couple weeks since the friendship boundary crossed. He subsequently told me he didn't want to date me and he didn't think we were compatible at all and he thought it was a one night thing because we were both fucked up and that he thought I knew that. He also said it shouldn't be a big deal since we didn't have sex and that he ""never got a vibe"" I liked him like that though he values our friendship.

I then told him it was fucked up that he couldn't just be direct and honest the next morning and that if he valued the friendship, he would've respected me enough to do that. I also said I felt like he had led me on for weeks and that I felt hurt by the situation and it was concerning that he couldn't see why I was upset.

I then heard he told a mutual friend he felt like he didn't handle his response to me well and wanted to reach out eventually, but I'm not holding my breath here.

I was told…go to the book store and coffee shop and just linger around looking friendly and approachable. How the hell does this one even work? If I’m at the book store I’m looking at the books!


I was told…go to the farmers market alone and walk around. Did that. You know who is at our farmers markets? Couples and families.

Karen (not the real name from HR: “I own 12 cats and have a TikTok dedicated to their synchronized meowing.”

Steve (not the real name from IT: “I once got electrocuted fixing a server, saw God, and he told me to clear my cache.”

Me: “…I’m really good at pretending to be interested in these games.”

Greg did not appreciate that.

Then came the team-building activity: an *office scavenger hunt.* Greg thought it would be a “great bonding exercise.” I thought it was a great way to make people resent each other more efficiently.

One of the tasks was to find ""something that represents your job.""

Marketing team? A stress ball, because “we squeeze out ideas with no budget.”

Accounting? A bottle of whiskey from under their desk.

Me? I just pointed at the coffee machine and whispered, “This is my entire personality.”

Finally, at 3 PM, Greg unveils the Friday “Surprise” Happy Hour. But since we’re still technically on the clock, the drinks are just…mocktails.

You ever had a *virgin margarita* while Karen pitches her “Cat Choir” side hustle?

I have.

Anyway, at 4:59 PM, I’m already halfway out the door, because it’s Friday, and if Greg tries to initiate one more “fun” activity, I will be updating my resume.

1ikazne,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestCoffeeTables/comments/1ikazne/honest_review_of_furinno_16049gyw_coffee_table/,Honest review of Furinno 16049GYW coffee table for small spaces,"I’ve been using the Furinno 16049GYW coffee table in French Oak Grey for a few weeks now, and it’s been an interesting experience. This compact, cross-legged table caught my eye for its minimalist aesthetic and budget-friendly price point, but there’s more to it than meets the eye.

The design is what drew me in initially. Its modern simplistic look with a cross-leg base gives it a unique charm. The French Oak Grey finish is understated yet stylish, fitting seamlessly into my living room's existing decor. However, the material—engineered wood—feels less luxurious than it looks. While it does the job, there’s no denying that it’s lightweight and somewhat fragile. It’s one of those pieces you know won’t survive a tumble or heavy use, but hey, you get what you pay for.

Speaking of size, this table is perfect for smaller spaces. Measuring 35.4 inches in width, 19.6 inches in depth, and 16 inches in height, it fits snugly in my apartment's limited living area. I’ve even used it as a craft station for my niece, who found the low height perfect for coloring. The bottom shelf adds a nice touch for extra storage space—ideal for books, magazines, or small decorative items. However, don’t expect it to hold a lot of weight; the maximum recommendation is 25 pounds, and honestly, I wouldn't test it to its limits.

[Time to see Furinno 16049GYW coffee table cost on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/product-reviews/furinno-16049gyw-coffee-table-review-b08xx3v5dd/)

Maintenance has been straightforward so far. I follow the care instructions and stick to a dry cloth for cleaning, avoiding harsh chemicals. The surface, however, isn't stain-resistant, so spills need to be wiped up quickly. A minor scratch appeared when my cat decided to test it as a scratching post, so keep that in mind if you have pets or kids who are rough with furniture.

Assembling the table was a mixed bag. The instructions were clear, and the hardware was provided, but you’ll need to supply your own tools. A screwdriver is essential, and a hammer might be useful for aligning the pieces. While I found it relatively simple, some reviews mentioned misaligned holes and fragile parts, which could be frustrating for others. Tightening the screws properly is crucial for stability, as any wobbling might be due to assembly issues rather than the design itself.

**Pros**

* Compact size fits well in small spaces.
* Stylish and modern French Oak Grey finish.
* Easy to clean with a dry cloth.
* Additional bottom shelf for storage.
* Affordable price point.

**Cons**

* Made of lightweight, fragile engineered wood.
* Not stain-resistant or scratch-proof.
* Limited weight capacity (25 pounds max).
* Assembly might be tricky for some due to misaligned holes.
* Durability is questionable for long-term use.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to coffee tables from IKEA or Sauder, the Furinno 16049GYW is a mixed bag. IKEA offers similar minimalist designs but often uses slightly sturdier materials, although at a higher price point. Sauder tables, on the other hand, tend to be more robust and stylish but are bulkier and less suited for small spaces. Where Furinno excels is its affordability and compact size, making it ideal for budget-conscious buyers or those with limited room to spare.

That said, if you’re looking for something more durable, you might want to consider alternatives like the IKEA Lack coffee table or Sauder North Avenue table. They cost more but offer better longevity and materials. Furinno works well if you’re okay with treating it gently and not overloading it.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

In terms of value, the Furinno 16049GYW delivers what you’d expect for a low-cost piece of furniture. It’s not going to last decades, nor will it impress with premium features, but it’s a great option for temporary setups or those on a tight budget. If you’re someone who moves frequently or just needs a functional table without splurging, this could be a good choice. However, if durability is a priority, consider investing a bit more for a sturdier alternative.

The table’s features are basic—cross-leg style, a bottom storage shelf, and a rectangular shape. While it doesn’t come with any bells or whistles like adjustable height or foldability, it serves its purpose well for everyday use. Just remember, this isn’t the table to lean on or pile heavy items onto.

1ikazhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/panicdisorder/comments/1ikazhu/for_those_who_need_hope/,For those who need hope,"Though I’m not one to share my feelings online, I’ve found comfort in other people’s stories, so I (Female 28) want to pass that forward. If this reaches even one person who feels alone, I hope it helps them know they’re not.

My earliest memories of frequent panic attacks began during my first year of college, shortly after the sudden death of a friend. It was the first time I truly understood how fragile and limited life is. The attacks made it impossible to sit through class. A wave of overwhelming dread would hit me, followed by dizziness. My throat would tighten, and I felt like I couldn’t breathe. Then came the chest pain, the racing heart, the fear that I might pass out—or worse, die. And yet, each time the attack passed, I was left exhausted, telling myself over and over that it was all in my head. But they didn’t stop.

They came on good days and bad days, becoming part of my daily life. I dreaded going to class. I struggled to sit still and read for assignments or pleasure. Life felt dark, and that darkness followed me throughout my entire college career. There were times I would leave my dorm or apartment in tears, frustrated and terrified that this might be the rest of my life. Some nights, I sat outside the emergency room, convinced something was physically wrong with me. I called family, desperate for reassurance. I tried everything—drinking more water, cutting out coffee, eating healthy, exercising, and getting more sleep. I even noticed that alcohol, in small amounts, temporarily numbed the anxiety, but too much would send my heart into a terrifying rhythm.

My heart became an obsession. I noticed every skipped beat, every flutter, every ""irregular"" rhythm. And the moment I noticed, another panic attack would follow. This cycle lasted all throughout college. I told myself therapy wasn’t for me. I assumed I was “above” medication, and that relying on it would mean I was weak. So I didn’t commit to therapy, and I refused to try medication. But the panic attacks never went away.

Later, in my years out of school, I remember driving home from work every day, knowing the car ride itself would trigger another attack. Feeling “stuck” made everything worse. I reached a point where I gave myself a deadline: If I had to live like this forever, I didn’t want to live.

Then, after seven years (2015-2022), I finally reached my breaking point. I was done. I needed to try something new. I saw a doctor and was prescribed Lexapro. I was skeptical—it would take weeks to work, and I didn’t want to get my hopes up. But that very evening, I sat down to do some coursework for my master’s classes, and for the first time in years, I felt calm. My body wasn’t buzzing with anxiety. I wasn’t jittery. I wasn’t waiting for the next attack.

I cried right then and there because, for the first time in so long, I felt like a person again.

There are so many lessons I’ve learned from this journey. I’ve learned to be grateful for the simple things—because for so long, I couldn’t even feel normal. I’ve learned not to be afraid of life because I’ve already faced something terrifying and came out on the other side.

If you’re struggling, if you’re hesitant about seeking help, please know that there is hope. You don’t have to live in fear forever. You are not alone.

In the sense that I am completely unable to do any kind of task, personal or professional independently. 

He would consistently come in late, sit down next to me and stare at my emails and read through them, would make comments if I’m looking at other opportunities within our organization. Stare at me as if he expects me to have a speech prepared but then wouldn’t say anything. Additionally, I can’t even stand up with him following me around. It’s like the concept of working independently or doing small tasks on your own is a foreign concept. I’m unable to take breaks in peace due to getting a million phone calls asking how to do xyz. I’m at the point where I’m about to just tell him that I’m here to perform my job title, not to dedicate myself to bringing him up to speed with everything and that he has the expectation for me to entertain him at work. 

It’s put me into a bit of an awkward situation. I had to write an email to our supervisor to bring to attention his tardiness as I was having the coworkers we are relieving complain, also it was bugging me a bit since I’m working alone for 20 minutes while I start my day tired (I can’t leave the site to grab coffee across the street). Since then he’s been acting in a way that’s very unnerving. It doesn’t help that some of our other coworkers in a different division don’t seem to acknowledge him since they don’t know him.

1ikatyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFIB/comments/1ikatyl/my_afib_journey_6_years_medications_and_now/,"My afib journey: 6 years, medications, and now waiting for ablation","I'm 43F and had my first afib episode at 37. It was completely out of the blue - I had just stepped out of the shower when my heart suddenly felt like it was trying to escape my chest. It was the most violent episode I've had to this day. My husband called an ambulance, and when the paramedics arrived, my heart rate was over 200 bpm. I was rushed to the emergency department, where it stayed between 180-200 bpm for about six hours before reverting on its own.

I had no idea what was happening, and the medical staff didn’t explain much. I genuinely thought I was dying. On top of that, I kept needing to pee (which I now know is common with afib), but the nurses wouldn’t let me walk to the bathroom in case I fainted. They were clearly annoyed at having to get the bedpan every time, which made an already scary situation worse. I was discharged the next day with instructions to see my GP for a cardiologist referral.

The long road to diagnosis

My first cardiologist had zero care factor. She did explain that afib is a lifelong, progressive disease, but beyond that, she wasn’t very helpful. I left feeling shaken—how could I not trust my own heart anymore? I started having regular episodes, so I got a referral to a specialist electrophysiologist (EP) at the best heart clinic in my state.

Because I hadn’t caught an episode on an ECG, they sent me for an EP study - basically, an invasive test where they insert electrodes through the groin and try to induce afib with small shocks. Ironically, I’d had an episode that very morning, but when they tried to trigger one during the procedure, my heart refused to cooperate. It was a complete waste of time. My EP suggested I get a Kardia Mobile to capture episodes myself and put me on a beta blocker while we waited for a Holter study.

The Holter test was actually kind of fun - I wanted to make sure it picked up a proper episode, so I went all in: little sleep, a few glasses of red wine, and multiple coffees. Sure enough, the results showed I was going in and out of afib, with one big episode in the middle. After two years of uncertainty, I finally had an official diagnosis.

Medications and side effects

I was put on daily flecainide and a beta blocker, with the doses gradually increasing over the years. The beta blocker made me feel slow and sluggish, so eventually, I was switched to verapamil instead. It’s better, but the side effects are still annoying - digestive issues (constipation and gas) and swollen ankles (cankles).

Now, I’ve maxed out the dosages of both medications, and my EP has put me on the waiting list for an ablation. Every day, I check the mail, hoping for a date. I can’t wait to stop taking lifelong medication, especially the verapamil.

My biggest triggers are:

Alcohol (red wine is the worst)

Caffeine

Lack of sleep

Hormones (I’m much more likely to have an episode during my period)

Big meals + warm showers (especially at night)


Now, I’m just waiting for my ablation and hoping it gives me some freedom from medication. It's great to read all you ablation stories and successes. It makes me feel hopeful about the future.

**Announcer:** ""In today's episode, we see Jimmy Butler, fresh off his departure from the balmy beaches of Miami, where the sun wasn't just hot, the team drama was scorching!""

Let's set the scene: Jimmy Butler has been traded to the Golden State Warriors, a team that's had its share of drama but perhaps wasn't prepared for the level of spectacle Butler brings. 

**Jimmy Butler:** ""I'm happy here, off the court, but I want to be back to somewhat dominant. I want to hoop and I want to help this team win. Right now, I'm not doing that.""

Oh, Jimmy, the irony. Here he was, in Miami, a city known for its vibrant nightlife, but apparently, the nightlife on the court wasn't vibrant enough for him. His joy, he claims, was lost somewhere between Heat culture and his own tumultuous behavior, leading to suspensions and a very public feud with the team's management.

**Announcer:** ""But wait! There's a twist! Jimmy's now in the Bay Area, where the weather is cooler, the coffee is better, but the patience for antics might just be shorter.""

The Warriors, in their quest for another championship, decided to roll the dice on Butler, thinking perhaps his playoff prowess could outweigh his penchant for chaos. But let's not kid ourselves; this isn't just a trade; it's a gamble. 

**Jimmy Butler:** ""Can you get your joy back here on the court?""

**Jimmy Butler:** ""Probably not.""

**Announcer:** ""Ouch! That's the sound of Warriors fans everywhere collectively wincing. What have you gotten yourselves into?""

Imagine this: you're the Warriors, a team synonymous with championships, and you've just signed up for what could be a sequel to ""Miami Vice,"" but instead of Crockett and Tubbs, you've got Curry and Butler. And Curry, bless his heart, is probably texting Butler during halftime, hoping to keep the peace, while secretly wondering what he got himself into.

**Announcer:** ""Will Jimmy find his joy amidst the Golden State's dynasty? Or will he turn this championship hopeful into a soap opera set?""

Only time will tell if Butler can channel his energy into winning rather than whining. But one thing's for sure, the NBA's popcorn sales are about to skyrocket because if there's one thing Jimmy Butler does well, it's giving us all something to talk about. 

**Announcer:** ""Stay tuned, folks, because in the NBA, as in life, drama is never in short supply, and Jimmy Butler is the main character we didn't know we needed but definitely can't ignore.""

In conclusion, whether Butler can transform from Miami's drama queen to Golden State's clutch hero remains to be seen. But one thing's for sure, the basketball world will be watching, popcorn in hand, ready for the next plot twist.",1,1738975908.0,FamilyVloggersandmore,0,1.0,False

Hope you are doing fine.  I've had an open myomectomy few months ago and since the surgery I don't eat cookies, chocolate, ice cream, etc ...  All things which contain sugar.  This because some small fibroids were left in place during surgery and I am afraid that they will grow.

I also don't eat yoghurt and diary.  I only drink coffee one to two times a week because I am afraid that coffee will also contribute to fibroid growth. 

I also eat red meat once a week to maximum twice a week but just a little bit.  

I do eat fruits every day, like grapes, Apple, banana etc, which contain sugars but natural sugars.  Are these also contributing to fibroid growth?  

Which type of fruits and vegetables are ok and which are not good for fibroids?   And is it true that coffee contribute to fibroid growth?  

Who follows also a fibroid diet and can share what they do to slow the growth?",1,1738975678.0,FibroidHerbalRemedies,0,1.0,False

I cut my morning bagels out and decided to fast til my noon salad. My salads were meals…high calorie with plenty of proteins and croutons n dressing etc. removed the croutons cause I honestly thought they were the issue. Switched to a swig of sugar free creamer in my coffee instead of free pouring regular sweetened creamer.

Increased my protein. Decreased carbs. After all that’s what my nutritionist said to do. She also told me to increase my calories and I did and I gained weight/stalled out.

I haven’t lost anything substantial since the summer. I’ve been gaining and losing the same 5lbs and don’t know what to do anymore.

We each get the same amount. We use this money for our individual wants. For example I spend most of mine on craft supplies and the occasional iced coffee. He mostly spends his on video games and an occasional take-out lunch. If we do something together like go out to eat, that's a separate budget category. Then everything else goes to bills, gas, groceries, household needs, prescriptions, repairs, savings, investments, etc. 

Anyway, is there something weird or wrong with this? I had mentioned it in another sub and got downvoted. But I made sure to explain it was an equal thing we both agreed upon. I honestly thought this was just a normal part of budgeting, but now I'm not so sure. Is this normal or is there something wrong about it?

I guess what I’m trying to ask is, is dating while living paycheck to paycheck advisable or accepted. I have my own apartment, no roommates, and I pay all the utilities, groceries, and rent by myself. However, I do not have a car and have to rely on other forms of transportation until I can afford one which won’t be for a very long while. With 2 jobs I work less than thirty hours but more than twenty combined. The first job I work 24 hours. Both pay $15 an hour (the second one plus tips) and pay every two weeks. I’m hoping the new job will give me full time very soon. So with all of this money going out and the second job not really boosting my income I am curious as to what everyone’s thoughts are regarding dating while living paycheck to paycheck. I don’t have a high paying job or career being in my very late 20’s because my college years were botched due to being forced to go to a no name college that didn’t have the major I wanted (still graduated though) and no car meant no internships etc. I want to get back in college in the future to likely be a therapist. I would like to think I can still find love in my situation but if I have to be alone or go for casual meetups for a while, I accept that reality. Thankfully I live across the street from a coffee shop and a handful of restaurants haha. Also the touristy spot isn’t far at all either.",0,1738975353.0,dating_advice,8,0.33,False

Been managing it for years, mostly with Acyclovir, taking it regularly at first, then switching to only when I felt an outbreak coming on (around 5 times a year). That worked well enough, but I hated carrying around those stupid chalky pills everywhere.

One day, my neighbor saw them in my pocket and gave me 'that look'—you know the one. I kinda laughed it off, but a week later, the dude shows up at my office with a small box and this bottle of clear liquid inside. We grabbed a coffee, and he told me he also had HSV and that one of his students (he is a prof in Marine science) did a report on an algae, *Porphyridium*.  Apparently, this microalga makes some bioactive compounds that mess with the virus. 

His student grew a batch, applied it, and swore it helped. My neighbor figured, why not? He tried it and claimed his outbreaks just stopped. Then he handed me the bottle and said, “Your turn.”

This was in 2023. Since then, I’ve had the occasional ""tingle"", but I just spray it on my... parts... and nothing develops. No sores, no full outbreak, just... nothing.

I have no clue why this stuff isn’t more well known, he called it *Porphyridium Conditioned Media*. If you’re dealing with the same thing, might be worth looking into. It's out there.   

Below are multiple papers on it.  If there is interest I will find more.  Happy to talk about it:
