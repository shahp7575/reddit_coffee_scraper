Sooo, I’m (21f), and my friend—let’s call him Jo (21m)—have been friends for almost 3 years now. We got to know each other through a mutual friend who is also my best friend and kinda his best friend too (she’s 4 years older than us).

When we first met, we used to go out as a group with other mutual friends, and things were normal—no feelings, no crush.

Sooo, since we met, Jo and I didn’t go out a lot until last year because my work was close to his house. Sometimes I would finish early and call him to see if he wanted to go to a restaurant or a coffee place, and he would agree.

At first, the hangouts were nice and fun, but then I started feeling the dizziness, my stomach flipping, and even nausea like I mentioned before. Even talking to my friend about what’s going on with him makes me nervous and uneasy.

 

I honestly don’t know if what I feel are butterflies in my stomach… or cockroaches or a warning sign or what.

I still haven’t told my best friend—our mutual friend. My girl told me to tell her everything, because maybe she could get a few words out of him and know how he feels about me.

Jo is such a great person—caring, loving, and peaceful—and many of our mutual friends can attest to that.

But I really want to keep him as a friend and get rid of this stomach anxiety, because he genuinely makes me anxious.",1,1769995117.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

Hello everyone. First things first, sorry for the ranting. I am just feeling overwhelmed and have a lot inside me I clearly cannot share outloud. So I am 29yo diagnosed since 2018 and had been struggling with my weight for YEARS, literally years always looking for lifestyle changes, adding exercise, managing my diets, worked with over 6 OBGYNS already. Never had a real success. Always loosing a few kilos and then bouncing up again as soon as I “drop” my watch. So much so that this 2025, having done much more exercise than I have ever in my life, I have reached prediabetes. So, for the time being I am working on a specific diet and exercise rutine with a Nutritionist, and focusing on lowering my GI and weight. And yes, I have had an improvement, lowered 5 kilos in the first month.

Today we (me and hubby) visited my parents, and we had lunch (well they had lunch ready for them, I had to go buy groceries to make my own meal). As we got talking and sharing a coffee, I told them both about my progress, but also my concerns: it isn’t the first time I have tried, I am constantly tired and that makes it harder for me to focus on moving my body, I have mood swings, and I am concerned if I get too restrictive with my food intake, it will happen as usual, I will get frustrated and drop it before I even help myself. I literally saif “it’s hard, but I am trying my best”. To this my mothers response was “you worry too much”. As she says every single time I comment something like this. I got frustrated and asked her what she meant by that, even though I knew. “You concern yourself too much with this. You always have. If its not your skin tags, its the weight, and the hormones, you read too much, you worry too much. Just relax, you will figure it out. You always figure it out. I feel like you make it such a big deal”. She even said I must be anemic and that’s why I feel this way (labs don’t said that, and I even take Iron supplements).

Surprisingly I didn’t snap. I wanted to. But it would end up as usual, I was overreacting. At the same time I didn’t want to give in as usual. To say “yeah, maybe it’s me” and let it go. Any other day I would’ve, sometimes I even think that’s what she is looking for. To make me snap and confirm her opinion, or to force me to swallow the anger and ignore it. Either way she’s right in her mind. But I didn’t. I am a EXHAUSTED of brushing those comments off and feeling like I either make a big thing out of everything or I am not doing enough and I should work even harder. I told her “I feel like you are always dismissing me. You know absolutely nothing about PCOS, you don’t know how it’s diagnosed, you don’t understand how it affects me, you always do this. Not even doctors know much about it. You are constantly asking me to look for a second opinion, well, I have had SEVERAL doctors and they are still telling me I would be fine if I just lowered my weight. Of course I would! When my doctor prescribed anxiety medication you were appalled, you literally asked me not to take it, said I was too young, I didn’t need that, and I felt like shit for MONTHS. I have listened to you and not my doctors”.

Of course she got mad, got offended, started crying, said I always do this, I always bring up things that are old just to hurt. Just to argue. So she brought up a mental health episode I had a few years ago, were I lost my temper horribly and hurt her, telling her very bad things about how I spent years self harming and how she never noticed (for which I apologized profusely, several times after, because I know it was wrong to put that responsibility on her, but I was 12yo when I started), and you know what? Maybe If I was taking my anxiety medication that wouldn’t have happened at all.

Long story short she got so hurt and offended by me standing for myself and letting her know how I feel when she dismisses my efforts like this. I said “well seems like we remember things very differently” and cut it off, going back into the house. We had decided to leave around 1hr later (around 8pm) When we went out, she had left the property, out on a walk. Without telling anyone and without saying goodbye to me or my husband. I am so tired of her playing victim, so I decided we would leave anyway. And low and behold when we are 1 block away we bump into her, slowed down, pulled in to say goodbye on the road. She doesn’t even acknowledge us in the car and keeps walking, while sobbing.

We left. I cried the whole trip back.

Now: I know I am hard to deal with. I know I have my temper. I have my bad reactions. And I acknowledge my mistakes when I can recognize them. That is something I had to learn by myself. By hitting many walls, hurting and getting hurt many times. My mother has not apologized to me, with honesty, ever. 29 years. Ever. So I am not lowering my head anymore. I am not pushing through the comments and just holding my tongue not to be exactly that: the overreactor. The drama queen (my parents nickname for me). I am considering distancing. I have had enough for a few lifetimes. I am tired of always being the one who has to just accept it and move on. And instead of feeling like I go to my parents to share, to laugh, to feel understood and appreciated, I see them because I have to. I visit because it’s my job. My responsibility. I have to go because if not I get the calls about how I don’t appreciate them. How I never want to share anything. I can’t focus on keeping them happy and helping myself at the same time. Idk. AITAH? Maybe, maybe I just got to tired of being their drama queen.",1,1769995010.0,PCOS,0,1.0,False
1qtgz1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BayonneNJ/comments/1qtgz1r/new_transplant_bitching_about_the_water/,"New transplant, bitching about the water","So I'm back on the East coast after 13 years in Portland, OR. Typically, I don't have reservations about drinking local water wherever I go, but my girl, who's lived in Bayonne most of her life won't even make coffee with this stuff. 
Now I know I've been spoiled for a while with fresh mountain water, and maybe I just need time for the nose to adjust, but damn. 
I'm not trying to shit on Bayonne, either. I've enjoyed all of the time I've spent here over the years, except for when they towed my car.

1qtgyz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/KashKickapp/comments/1qtgyz7/heres_how_you_sneak_kashkick_into_a_normal/,"Here’s how you sneak KashKick into a normal, chaotic day.","PSA: nobody’s getting rich off this. It’s more like coffee money / gas money / “eh, why not” money.

**6:30am — Doomscroll o’clock**  
Alarm goes off. You grab your phone like always. Instead of opening email or the news and instantly ruining your mood, you open KashKick real quick to enter the daily giveaway just for logging in. Takes \~5 seconds and keeps a streak going.

**7:30am — Gas station**  
Gas light’s on (obviously). Before leaving, you sign up for Upside through KashKick. Takes maybe a minute. Upside gives cash back on gas anyway, and KashKick gives you a reward just for signing up.

**9am — Coffee that feels slightly less guilty**  
You grab coffee using money you already cashed out from KashKick earlier. There’s something oddly satisfying about paying for caffeine with “free app money.”

**12pm — Lunch break = grocery planning**  
You realize the fridge is empty while sitting at your desk. You sign up for Shipt through KashKick, get a reward for the signup, *then* another reward for placing an order through the app.

**3:30pm — Waiting around anyway**  
Kid pickup / commuting / sitting around waiting for something. You know the drill. Instead of endless scrolling, you knock out a couple surveys. The nice part: you can see how long they’ll take and what they pay upfront, so you only do the ones that feel worth it.

**6pm — Casual referral moment**  
You mention KashKick to a friend while hanging out. If they sign up with your link, you get a cut of what they earn (they don’t lose anything). Not pushing it, just a casual “yeah, I use this sometimes.”

**8:30pm — TV time**  
If you’re looking into a streaming service, you sign up through the deals on KashKick instead of going directly. Same service, but at least you get rewarded for it.

**11pm — Brain won’t shut up**  
You play a little Solitaire in bed. Low effort, kinda calming, and it earns rewards if you hit certain goals. Way better than staring at the ceiling.

**End of day thoughts**  
This isn’t a side hustle. It’s not grinding. It’s just stacking small stuff you’re already doing.

Once you hit $10, you can cash out to Paypal, Venmo or even with gift cards. Most people just let it build and treat it like bonus money. At minimum, your coffee pays for itself ☕️

  
How do you spend your day with KashKick? Sound off below! ",1,1769994973.0,KashKickapp,0,1.0,False
1qtgysh,https://www.reddit.com/r/FeatherInInk/comments/1qtgysh/one_thousand_eight_hundred_and_twentyseventh_night/,One Thousand Eight Hundred And Twenty-Seventh Night,"The first day past my deadline, I gave myself a break. We can agree I earned it in some way, yes? Besides it was laundry day so I didn't go absolutely nothing. Plus, I did write a little last night; 457 words. It isn't a thousand but goodness knows I've written less during the actual day and I did that at midnight. I am always saying I am going to 'write tonight' but less than have the time actually do so I have been very happy with myself. I think I haven't been writing at night just because it has taken me some time to get used to my desktops 'new' keyboard which is actually an old keyboard that Father gave me. The buttons are slightly bigger and sticky; I can use it but I am far more conscious of my typing which makes it hard to focus on the story. I think I am finally get used to it so writing down hear does not feel like pulling teeth anymore.

In desperate efforts to keep the news from dragging me into a pit of despair, I have started reading Northhanger Abbey by Jane Austen. I didn't get too far, just three chapters. I am really enjoying the writing style, it is very old fashioned and intricate. I am frequently coming across words and phrases I do not recognize and have the opportunity to pause and learn. I am not yet taken in by the story itself yet, though. Not a critique, mind you, I just don't tend to be drawn in to stories that centre romance quite as quickly as other genres. I'll need to give the story and myself more time to enthral me.

Now, I am going to relax for a little while longer, have a coffee and a cookie, then prepare myself to write. It doesn't need to be a thousand words, I must remind myself, but goodness, it wouldn't hurt if it was.

Yours & Mine,

1qtguo8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qtguo8,Do I have this setup right?,"Picture 1 is my 3 bucket system. Each bucket is 2.5 gal size.  

Bottom bin has no holes.  

Middle green bucket has holes all throughout the bottom and top rim, woms, compost, dry and wet (finely shredded coconut husks, coffee bean hulls, food scraps). Its a good consistency, not too wet or dry.  

Red bucket is just added today. Same hole setup along bottom and rim. Stocked with similar mix as bottom but no worms. They will hopefully move up once they've eaten through their current mixture.  

 My concern is that the red bucket has covered the holes on the rim of the middle bucket where they currently reside. Is this going to suffocate them? Do I need a spacer to keep the holes uncovered or are the airholes on the red bin sufficient?

I purchased 1lb of Red wiggler worms, they came in a box with some compost so im insure if thats the combined weight or not.  

I am looking for some feedback on my setup. Am I ready for the top bucket? Or should I give it some time with just the one bucket plus button catchment bucket?

She has become toxic, and idk what else to do. I need advice.","I 27(TF) have been dating my now GF F(23) for the last 5 years. Our relationship has had a lot of ups and downs (more downs), and I need some advice on what to do.  I'm finically trapped.

She has stopped taking care of herself to that point that has contracted a UTI and let it get so bad that it spread to her kidneys, causing her to end up in the hospital. I told her multiple times to get herself checked out but she refused.  
Not only that but she has also stopped showering completely, the smell hits you hard when you enter the same room as her. The most she will do is run water over herself maybe once a week.

She has stopped wearing underwear altogether about 4 years ago, including during that time of the month (She has bleed through our bed sheets more times then I can count), and will wear the same pants for 4 or 5 days at a time. When she finally takes them off,  she just throws them on the floor where the dog will chew the crotch out of them.

She has gained a lot of weight, she only eats unhealthy sugary foods, she hides food from me. This one time she order a pint of ice cream on door dash in the middle of the night, ate the entire thing, and I only found out when I saw it in the trash in the morning. She also doesn't drink anything (I mean anything, not soda, water, juices, coffee, tea, nothing) idk how she's still alive.

When it comes to household chores I have to do everything, laundry, dishes, cooking, cleaning, taking out the trash, making the bed, everything is on me, if I don't do it, it doesn't get done.

She has asked for open communication between us, but every time I try to communicate with her it always turns into a fight between us. I also can't hangout with my friends, she hates them all, and will call and text me constantly when I'm out with them. She becomes a different person when they are around. I can't have friends over because of her.

One night I woke up with her on top of me SAing me. She has no respect for my personal space, admitting to touching me in my sleep, jumping on me and humping me, even when I tell her not to. Blowing vape smoke on my exposed chest. I suspect that she has cheated on me with men from her work, and that she's doing drugs again behind my back. I'm worried about catching something from her.

I feel like I am trapped. She told me last night that she wants to wrap my car around a pole. She has become so toxic. I want her to get professional help but that starts a fight. I am blamed for everything, she manipulates and gaslights me. She twists my words. I told her to go to the hospital (for her UTI), and she told me she's not going, the next day she told me that I should have brought her to the hospital.

I'm worried that she's going to unalive herself if I break up with her. She has threated it before. I am also finically tied to her, making it hard to leave her. I don't have a job right now, (currently looking, and interviewing) so she pays our bills.

Reddit please give me some advice.

TLDR; My 23F girlfriend is a biohazard due to bad hygiene, has SAd me, and is mentally abusing me, but I'm financially tied to her and it's making it hard to leave her.",1,1769994623.0,rapecounseling,1,1.0,False

Holsord, Sordland

It was a sunny day in the city of Holsord. The Capital of the country was bustling with activity; the economic downturn of Alphonso was a distant memory. The newly constructed L1-Railway and electronic factory have boosted trade between Sordland and Lespia and brought the two countries closer. Trading between Angland has also boomed as Anton Rayne achieved a beneficial deal for Sordland in exchange for recognition of the Island of Hejiland as Anglandian, which was controversial as the island is heavily disputed territory between Angland and Valgsland. Cars were also becoming more common in the country try as cheap oil from Wehlen flooded the Sordish market. This led to public outcry by many Bludish and human rights activists, as President Smolak is using the money from the sale to continue his violent suppression of the BFF in the country.

In one of the city's many Cafes, Frank Rayne, son of the president, was dining with his girlfriend, a bludish University Student. Were enjoying a nice coffee and dessert by the side of the street. nearby a man observes the couple while sipping a cup of coffee; he was tasked by the President himself to watch over his son and ensure no foul harm would come to him or his girlfriend.

""Hey Sarrah, I've been thinking, do you want to go out and watch the new movie this weekend? I heard it's pretty good."" Franc asked nervously.

Sarrah chuckled. ""Of course, I even heard that it's starring a Bludish actor as the main character. I would never hear the end of it from my parents if I didn't ""Show support for my fellow Bluds,"" she said sarcastically, which made both of them laugh.

""Well im sure my dad would love it, having his son be seen watching a movie with a Bludish girl would get him votes with the Bludish and liberal population of the country.""

""Honestly, your dad must be the country's most overpaid and underpaid caretaker. I honestly don't think I could do half the stuff your dad did to appease almost everyone."" The girl said. ""My dad was honestly planning on joining the BFF with how desperate the situation got, and now he's singing praises for your father.""

""That's my dad for you, somehow he managed to have the time to help me study while doing his job. I only barely passed thanks to him."" Franc confessed.

""Aww, that's great of him. Anyways, I just read the latest book by Yolkien, and it was honestly the greatest ending of the series, I mean-""

As the teenagers continued their date, the Bodyguard turned his head and looked around to spot any potential threats. Suddenly, he felt a chill crawl up his spine; something felt very wrong. Immediately, he looked around, and in front of his eyes, a large gate slowly appeared out of nowhere in the middle of the street.

Immediately, people stopped and began to look at the large structure that manifested. Even Franc and his girlfriend looked at it wide-eyed and in shock.

Something began to walk out, men in horse back wearing Renan armor began to enter through the gate. Their words were foreign and unknown. Suddenly, one of them pulled out a sword and pointed at the crowd, and shouted something in a strange tongue. Then they began to charge, the crowd quickly panicked and tried to flee, but many of them were cut down. More strange things began to spill out of the gate; large pig-headed like Behemoth wielded giant clubs and began to charge at the civilians, adding more to the chaos.

The bodyguard saw one of the horsemen charging at Franc and his girlfriend. Thinking quickly, he pulled out his gun and shot the man through the chest. The rider fell to the ground as his horse panicked and retreated to the gate.

The gunshot seemed to snap Franc out of his stupor. Looking back at the bodyguard, the man pulled out his badge from his coat and said, ""Franc, my name is David Meyers. I'm your fathers bodyguard sent to look after you, you and your girlfriend need to leave NOW! follow me."" looking back at the chaos Franc didnt have much of a choice, nodding at the man they quickly ran away from the scene with David shooting a couple of shots at any of the Renan looking soldiers attempting to chase after them.

Holsord, Police Department

Today was a very strange day for Chief of Police Karl Greiser. The station was in organized chaos as officers rushed towards the armory and grabbed whatever heavy guns they could get before getting to their cars and rushing towards Holsord Square. Walking into the office, he asked one of the callers what the hell was going on.

""Sir, we've received a lot of calls around Holsord Square, we have a mass Cas, situation. We got dead numbering in the dozens and wounded in the hundreds. We don't know much detail other than they are wearing Renan armor and are charging people with swords and bows, some of the more outlandish calls are telling us that giants are a thing and killing people.""

Karl processed the information for a moment before taking action. ""Call in every off-duty cop and tell them to get their asses here. Get the Gendarmerie on the line and tell them to bring everything they can bring to Holsord ASAP."" The Police chief walked into the Armory and walked out holding a shotgun.

""Tell them to meet me at 11th street. Charles your riding with me, I need to see this myself, now let's move!"" Pumping his shotgun to emphasize his point, every officer still remaining quickly armed themselves and drove out of the station.

Holsord, Sordland

Franc was panting alongside his girlfriend as they tried to catch their breath, they've been running for the past few minutes. Looking around Franc saw that David barely looked tired and was more focused on pointing his gun on any threats that may jump on them.

""Are we safe yet?"" Asked his Girlfriend, tired and panting.

""No, not yet."" The bodyguard replied. ""A car is waiting for us in the otherside of the block, come on Let's move."" He said.

Continuing their journey, they sneaked through the streets if the city, guided by the experienced bodyguard through hot zones until they reach the car.

Unfortunately Someone got there first as the car was brutally crushed and it's Occupants certainly Dead.

Muttering a few Sordish curses the bodyguard spotted a nearby abandoned car. Smashing the window, he opened the door and entered the car, finding the keys still in its ignition he called out to them.

""Get in, I'll drive."" With no other choice they entered the stolen car as the driver quickly drove towards the Maroon Palace.""

Holsord, Maroon Palace

Anton Rayne, the President of Sordland was in his office having a meeting with several of his minister over the issues still plaguing Sordland until Lileas Graf and Iosef Lancea busted through the door.

Before the President could reprimand them for interrupting the meeting they said. ""Mr. President we have a situation going on in Holsord, We are Under attack.""",2,1769994273.0,suzerain,0,1.0,False

1qtgm0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qtgm0r/the_more_we_try_to_gamifyhomogenize_dating_the/,"The more we try to gamify/homogenize dating, the unhappier everyone is","The answers to basically every dating question on reddit (and in life) are pretty consistent:

It depends. All men/women are different. There's no one right answer.

However, despite this, societally, dating has become gamified to a point of almost no return. Each and every day, people from all walks of life try to obtain the secrets to dating success and the best tips for getting that competitive edge. Where to go, what hobbies men/women like, what to wear, how to wear it, what fragrances are good, what good and bad date places are, how to optimize a dating profile, the list goes on. And while these things are often being done and these questions are being asked in good faith, what we end up doing, in my opinion, is homogenizing the dating field. 

How interesting is it, really, if 8 out of 10 people you come across are in a run club or do indoor rock climbing? How unique is it if the majority of the people you meet dress the same? How fun is it if two out of three dates that you go on are for coffee or a drink? How fun is it to scroll through 100 dating app profiles and see 75 of them answer the same prompts the same way?

The more we try to gamify dating and crack the code to figure out the best, most efficient way to get our desired outcome, the more that the same advice gets peddled over and over. The more that advice gets peddled, the more it gets taken, and the more it gets taken, the more people end up as different versions of essentially the same person. That's where people check out.

How can it be fun to date when the people you're meeting have the same personalities and the same supposed interests? How much can you enjoy yourself when you're going on dates to the same spots over and over, just with a different person?

In my opinion, dating just needs more individuality. It needs more comfort with self. We don't need more people joining run clubs and going to indoor rock climbing or joining book clubs because someone told them that's the best way to meet people. We need more people comfortable enough with themselves to play to their strengths and pursue their own interests as they have them, not just joining stuff because that's where all the cool kids are. Once the landscape is less homogenous and similar, then I think people will have fun again. But if you keep running into the same kind of person over and over because they're being told that's who they should be in order to be acceptable, then yeah, people are going to get tired of it and check out.",1,1769994013.0,dating_advice,4,0.67,False

1qtgkut,https://i.redd.it/wsb77lblbzgg1.png,The Coffee Betrayal: Your Morning Brew is in Fact A Sulfur Bomb,"Oh boy, I’m really sorry about this one… I know many of you are going to be devastated, but we need to talk about the ""C-word."" No, not caffeine - **Coffee.**

For most of the world, coffee is the nectar of the gods. But for our community, especially those of us tracking **sulfur sensitivity, SUOX impairment or H2S SIBO**, coffee might be the reason you’re feeling ""wired but tired"" or dealing with ""rotten egg"" GI issues. It’s like the charming guest at breakfast who quietly overstays their welcome in your metabolic pathways.

**The Thiol Truth**

We usually think of sulfur in terms of eggs or broccoli, but coffee is a powerhouse of **volatile thiols** (sulfur-containing compounds).

* The primary compound that gives coffee its ""roasty"" aroma is **2-furfurylthiol**.
* These thiols aren't in the green bean; they are created during the **Maillard Reaction** that occurs during the roasting process.
* **The Rule of Roast:** The darker the roast, the more the sulfur-containing amino acids break down into potent thiols. **That dark French Roast? It's a sulfur-fest.**

**The Molybdenum Hijack**

Remember our friend the **SUOX enzyme**? It’s the one that clears sulfites and requires **Molybdenum** to work. When you drink coffee, you aren't just getting a caffeine hit; you're dumping a load of thiols into a pathway that might already be struggling. If you’re low on Moly, those coffee thiols can’t be cleared properly, leading to:

* **The Dirty Buzz:** That jittery, toxic feeling that feels different from a clean caffeine spike.
* **Brain Fog & Fatigue:** Your liver getting stuck trying to process the sulfur load.
* **The Rib-Area ""Liver Itch"":** A classic sign some of us know too well!

**Why Fake Coffee usually fails**

Ever wondered why chicory or dandelion coffee tastes... well, not like coffee? It’s because they lack these specific sulfur compounds! Coffee's unique ""bitter-savory"" profile is chemically **tied to its sulfur content**. To get the taste, you have to take the sulfur.

**Rare Responder Tips for the Coffee-Obsessed**

* **Lighten Up:** If you must indulge, choose a **Light Roast**. It has fewer thiols than the dark, oily beans.
* **The Moly Buffer:** Some find that taking their Molybdenum dose 30 minutes before coffee helps ""prime the pump"" for sulfur clearance.
* **Watch the Add-ins:** Many keto creamers or boxed milks contain **guar gum or carrageenan**, which are also sulfur-heavy or gut-irritants.
* **Listen to your Zen:** If you’ve finally reached a state of calm, consider if that cup of bitter liquid is really worth the metabolic noise.

**Stay curious, stay salty and watch your sulfur bucket!**

I am a first time user of Nespresso, got it like 2 weeks ago. Since then, I have tried various flavours. However, I am unable to understand the difference between flavours. Almost all of them taste like burnt coffee and dark roast. Even the decaf one... The only ones different were the ones which has milk recipe like scuro and all.

I don't know what I am doing wrong, it's a new machine so I don't suspect any dirt or anything. But then seing this sub, I see people like it, and I don't know what is wrong in my case.

For context, I do like coffee, before this I used to brew grounded coffee using the dripper. So, I do appreciate a good coffee. But this one doesn't feel good.

I have tried various coffee strength flavours (lowest being 5-6), but even that feels just a dark roast coffee. For example, Tokyo Lungo, I couldn't feel any flavour in it at all.

What am I doing wrong, I have tried tap water / filter water, but no difference. Obviously scaling hasn't happened yet... Is my machine broken? Is there a setting which I need to do to control the water temperature?

Any help will be appreciated, thank you.

1qtggoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditHorrorStories/comments/1qtggoz/the_corpse_matron/,The Corpse Matron,"Greene Memorial Clinic in Wingston was founded in the 1950s, and many cases of disappearance have occurred. Many residents say that a ghost known as the Corpse Matron wheels people away in the middle of the night. Many argue that it's just a rumor and that those missing patients passed away.

If they had, why wasn't the other staff on shift notified?

Yet somehow, the date and time of their passing were written in red ink in their files, along with the initials A.E. at the bottom of the paper. It was narrowed down to someone on the night shift when asked who they were.

They were probably someone that the other co-workers didn't know well.

When Gael Davis was assigned to investigate the old disappearances, the record keeper took him to an old, small, dusty file room where patient records were kept from the clinic's opening to the changeover. Twenty years of records were stored here from the 1950s to the 1970s.

As Gael stepped into the room, he flipped on the light switch and exhaled an exhausted sigh. He hadn't even started pouring through the countless files. The record keeper, an older lady named Sylvie, handed over the key and looked up at Gael, hands on her hips.

""Now, remember to lock up this room when you're done, and don't take anything home with you."" She wagged her finger at him.

""Yes, ma'am,"" he nodded, offering her a smile.

Sylvie tutted and left, allowing Gael to begin his work. He let out a low whistle as the door closed, taking in the stack of boxes and the overflowing filing cabinet.

Pulling over a crate to sit on, he started going through the first of the three boxes stacked next to the filing cabinet. The police chief told Gael before he left that he would be looking for the initials A.E. for Miss Absinthe Esper.

She had been a suspect in the cases back in the 1950s but was never found guilty. Instead, Absinthe insisted another co-worker was framing her. When asked who could be trying to frame her, she made the excuse that it was probably an intern who had conveniently stopped working there when the police started to investigate.

Wingston police have suspected her for years but never had enough evidence to warrant an arrest. Now, years later, and Absinthe has long since passed away, they could no longer charge her with the disappearance of the patients.

Opening the first folder in the stack, Gael flipped through the pages, checking to see if there were any end-of-life papers in the back, along with a copy of the coroner's report. Setting it aside, he didn't see the initials A.E., so he continued skimming through the stack.

When he got to the next box of folders, he saw Absinthe's signature start to appear—starting with a young man named Theodore Jones. He was in for an Appendectomy. During the night, while he was recovering, his body went missing under the watchful eye of Miss Esper. Who had proclaimed that Theodore had left his room in the middle of the night when she was doing the nightly rounds to check on the patients.

What exactly did she do with the bodies?

There was a knock at the door, and Gael closed the folder, looking over his shoulder. ""Come in,"" he said.

The door swung open, and clinic director Holt Greene walked in. He was a short, stout man with a curly mustache. ""Any progress, Mr Davis? The clinic will close soon, and only the emergency side will open.""

""Yeah, I found where Absinthe started signing the papers on the missing patients,"" Gael replied, standing up on wobbly knees.

Holt nodded and looked around the room. ""Sylvie gave you the keys, so go ahead and lock up."" The director left the room, waving goodbye over his shoulder and heading down the hall. Setting the file down, Gael walked over, flipping off the light switch and glancing at the room one last time before locking it up and heading home.

Walking to his car, he looked over his shoulder to the clinic's second floor.

In one of the windows was a figure of a woman in a light pastel dress with an apron over the top and a cap with a nursing symbol. Her entire body is translucent. When she smiled at him, it stretched inhumanly from ear to ear, possibly stained with red lipstick.

When Gael blinked, she disappeared. Rubbing his eyes, he narrowed it down to being tired. He got into the passenger side and turned on the engine, deciding to make his way home for the night. Gael saw things because he had been staring at paperwork for too long. This unsolved case must be getting to him.

The following morning, Gael made his way back to Greene Memorial. He walked through the front door, sipping coffee from a drive-through shop.

Digging into his pocket, he procured the keys, fumbled to get them into the lock, and let the door creak open. Geal stepped on foot inside and flipped on the light switch, looking around the room. It was cold, and a chill traveled down his spine, even with the warm disposable cup in his hand. He also noticed condensation on the walls, slowly dripping to the floor.

""Time to get to work,"" Gael said to no one in particular and sat on the same crate from yesterday. He opened a new file and set it aside if it had the initials A.E.

As Gael began to have a pretty good stack, he stretched and took a break, sipping down the last bit of bitter-cold coffee. The sound of footsteps began to echo down the hall, and Gael figured it was either Sylvie or Holt, but when he walked over to the door and looked down the hall, he found it empty.

Gael chuckled, ""It's just my mind playing tricks on me.""

He turned and came face to face with the same woman he saw yesterday.

""Good morning."" she smiled, her lips still turned upwards in an unnatural way. Geal nodded. ""Mornin'."" he returned the greeting, watching her look over at the small table he had placed the files onto.

""Visitors aren't supposed to be in here."" Her gaze was back on him, and she tilted slightly to the side.

""Oh, I'm not a visitor."" Gael thought carefully before choosing his following words. ""I was sent here by a client to check relatives' records since they're getting tests done. To make sure it's nothing genetic.""

She crossed her arms over her chest. ""Do I look like I was born yesterday? I know exactly why you're here.""

""You do?"" he blinked, confused but acted surprised.

Absinthe Esper pursed her upturned lips, making her look like a sweetlip fish. She wagged her finger for him to lean in closer, and he reluctantly complied.

In a hushed whisper, she told him, ""You know about the demon in the morgue, too."" Gael cocked his head and furrowed his brows, watching her bare a toothless pitch-black mouth and place a finger to her lips, silencing him.

Absinthe nodded. ""You must keep him fed, or he will swallow this place whole."" He leaned back, standing at his full height. ""And this demon told you this?"" Gael questioned.

She nodded and looked around him, her eyes widening. Gael caught this and peered over his shoulder, seeing nothing; no one was there. Absinthe had seen something and disappeared. According to her ghost, there was a demon in the morgue.

Gael didn't want to admit it, but he would have to go down into the morgue. The place he knew would have to go down eventually, but not this soon. At this point, he didn't have a choice. Opening the filing cabinet, Gael looked for an old map to determine where the old morgue would be.

With the yellow parchment in hand, he exited the record room and shut it behind him, locking it with the key. Following the layout on the map, the old morgue was on the first floor, which now would be considered the basement. Gael would need to take the elevator down, but he would need a key to access that floor.

The only person to ask would be Holt Greene, the clinic director. As Sylvie walked past, he stopped her, asking if she knew if the director was in today. ""No, he isn't in his office today. Why, what do you need?"" she asked, giving him a questioning stare.

""I need the key to access the basement from the elevator,"" Gael replied.

""Why on earth do you want to go down there?"" Sylvie pressed.

""I think there is vital information down there."" he quipped.

She studied Gael and shook her head. ""If it keeps you out of my hair, I will get it. Meet me at the elevator on the first floor.""

Sylvie disappeared around the corner of the hallway, and Gael went to wait for her at the elevator. He didn't have to wait long before she showed up, handing over a tiny red key.

""Make sure to return it when you finish.""

""Yes, ma'am.""

She rolled her eyes and went on her way. Gael entered the elevator, inserted the tiny red key, turned it on, and pressed the B1 button. She watched the doors close, and the elevator creaked and rocked, beginning its descent. The doors slowly creaked open, revealing nothing but complete darkness.

Taking out his phone, he turned on the light, stepped out of the elevator, and looked around. He used his free hand to cover his nose as he walked further in. A putrid, sour smell with a sickeningly sweet undertone was in the air. This was where Absinthe said the demon lived—the one she said she fed all those innocent people to.

Gael's foot bumped into something, causing it to clatter and roll across the floor. When he shone his light on the direction of the item, he saw a hand reach out and snag it away. What was that just now?

There was shuffling and the sound of crunching close by. When Gael found the source, he wished that he hadn't. Before him, he was a tall man, or could it be considered that? Their limbs were unnaturally long, their skin covered in gray scales, and their eyes glowed bright yellow.

Gael felt frozen in place. He scolded himself for not running back to the elevator and getting out of this place. Instead, he felt a hand on his shoulder to his left. When Geal turned to look, he saw Absinthe standing next to him, her form flickering.

""It was nice of you to come here without a fuss. My master is hungry and will soon need a meal."" her face looked up at Gael's. She still had that awful, unnatural, upturned smile; her lips, which were stained red, were now smeared. She dug her nails into his shoulder, causing him to flinch and drop his phone. It bounced when it hit the ground, scattering across the floor, causing the demon to turn his attention to the two behind him.

The demon stood to his full height, leering down at them.

""Master, I've brought you another meal. Will he suffice?"" Absinthe offered with a show of her hand towards Gael, who began to back away. It sniffed the air, and yellow eyes locked onto its new meal and roared.

He began returning to the elevator with the demon on his heels.

When Gael got to the door, he frantically pressed the button. A scaled arm shot out and grabbed him, pulling him backward by the back of his head and lifting him. He kicked wildly into the air and pulled at the hand that suspended him in the air.

The demon leaned close to his ear, speaking some language he thought was Latin until he heard it repeat the words.

""Only death awaits you here.""

To confirm that he meant the words spoken, the demon sunk his fangs into Gael, drinking his blood and chewing his flesh. Gael tries to scream but is silenced by a piece of duct tape being slapped onto his mouth by Absinthe, who presses a finger to her lips, silencing him.

""Now be a nice sacrifice to the master, and don't make a fuss.""

I’m finding that this is not working out at all.

At one point I would say I had an ok circle. 

However, i think the word friendship has a lot of weight around it and I look at the community the older women in my life have think it would be ok to look for even something even the slightest little bit similar. 

Some of the ways things haven’t worked out: 

No matter what on my birthday when i make plans even if its just dinner it someone how never works out, at one point one of my friends didn’t even respond and went clubbing on my birthday down the road from me.

I’m part of a group chat and they’ve never thought to include me in the external group chat that they make their plans in but have no problems talking about what they did in front of me. 

My love language is giving and just overall doing things for people, i love to get up to the most random things and used to hate having down time so I found I could give back in a lot of ways. But I very quickly found out that the same people i was doing all of that for didn’t even consider me close enough to tell me anything let alone invite me out to something as simple as coffee as often as the sample people we were in the same friend group as. They never checked up on me at my lowest when I was the sickest I’ve ever been.

Someone who I thought was my friend of 10 years told me when I talked to him he just considered me a friend to invite out partying despite me trying to make plans that didn’t involve that. ( I go clubbing maybe once a month)

I’ve tried to talk to them I’ve tried to talk to third parties. 

Some things that may be important but I’m not sure, I’ve lived in the us for about 14 years now I think but have only really been socialised as American for about 8ish 

I’ve never had anyone I meet say anything necessarily negative about me including friends of friends and usually leave social events with a few socials as I really like meeting new people.

My past longer term friends complaints are that I lack balls ( I was socialised a basically a first born African daughter I’m really working on this) 

And again about my lack of confidence ( this i believe is a touchy subject though as I’m in the Midwest as a midsized black girl) 

I am late to things but usually so have my friends so that typically cancels things out.

I’ve really just withdrawn from social life at this point. But ultimately I love doing things and meeting people. 

Is there another approach I should be taking to this or another way of meeting people I should be trying?

Im genuinely curious as to why. Why not invest 30 minutes having a coffee and a conversation in public first? Times I’ve done this, its worked out. If the chemistry is there , I invite them over. Yet lately, seems people dont want to bother with that. 

The one time I let someone come right over, It was a disaster. He was at least ten years older and 60 pounds heavier than his pics. Well, looks aren’t everything. Tried making conversation. Nothing to talk about, no chemistry. I didn’t want to upset him as he was a very large man. So I finally said “hey this just isn’t me. I’m sorry, but I’m not gonna do this”.

*Having sunk into the realm of her thoughts, Zofia would take her eyes off the notebook resting on her lap and gaze outside, at the rows upon rows of trees making up deep, uncharted forests she was passing by. Her head leaned against the window, feeling vibrations emanating from the train, getting lost in the clutter of its countless wheels. Ah, so many uncertainties, so many doubts. She felt the weight of her family’s issues on her shoulders, even if only partially.*

*“Maybe it’s not going to be that bad?” She thought to herself, glancing for a moment at an old suitcase she placed beside herself. “But when will I get to see them again? In months?” A sigh followed, a futile attempt at dispersing worries. Soon enough her new life would begin, yet what will it bring?*

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

**Greetings, everyone!**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking to GM this story, I’d love it if you contributed as well! Be it brainstorming, playing a side character from time to time, you name it. That way we both will enjoy this roleplay to the fullest (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

(I'd also be open to a similar roleplay inspired by ""Bride's story"" :3)

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

**About me:**

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you’ll understand <3

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

**About you:**

₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don’t want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let’s brainstorm them together!*
- *Be excited! Yeah, another cheesy one. Yet, I find it so fun to see an enthusiastic reply!*

*₊˚ ✧ ━━━━⊱⋆⊰━━━━ ✧ ₊˚*

Anyway, that is all from me, I believe. If you are interested, perhaps have some questions, feel free to poke your head in my DMs! Hopefully hear from you soon!",1,1769993018.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

It says to boil the maple syrup for 8 minutes until reduced by half. I boiled it for 3 times longer than that and it was still nowhere near reduced by half (by weight) and it actually just ended up burning (although maybe I should've mixed more) and is turning almost solid now that it's cooling. Anyone have any idea what I should do here? Should I just boil for 8 minutes like it says? It would probably take over 45 minutes to actually reduce the weight by half.

Tried adding a brim.  Ensured supports was on (gave me a warning for one of the three pieces when it wasnt).

1qtg10y,https://i.redd.it/c8sqkwky6zgg1.jpeg,I am very much an Ibanez bass player,"I'm 57 and I've played for more than 40 years (as a weekend warrior). Don't remember what my first couple of basses were, but I spent many years playing a p-bass in bands. Then I took a few years off from music. When I got back into it, I went to my local store and started playing the ones they had to see what spoke to me. The sweetest playing bass in the store that day was an Ibanez SR300 in racing orange. My first Ibanez and I loved it. 

A few years later I realized I needed to go five strings. I ended up with an Ibanez SR505. My main gig bass for several years. I gave that bass away to a family member with no money. So.. I needed a replacement! I bought an Ibanez BTB745. It looked like a coffee table, the kind you would put in your lakeside cabin in the Wisconsin woods. But damn. I have never played a better neck and fretboard. I could get crazy low action on it. 

A move across country meant that only a few things could make the journey. I sold most of my music stuff. Which means I needed a new five string bass! After careful consideration I ended up with the EHB1505MS pictured here. I'm the dork holding it.",4,1769992497.0,ibanezbass,1,1.0,False
1qtg0jc,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1qtg0jc/marigolds_part_1_of_2/,Marigolds (Part 1 of 2),"The marigolds reached up around me, golden and glowing, as I stood beneath the night sky. The moon stared back—bright, full, and impossibly close. Stars flickered behind it like forgotten memories. I exhaled slowly. I smiled without thinking. The air smelled sweet, the warmth of the flowers wrapping around me like a blanket.

A black silhouette floated toward me, backlit by the moon, turning it into a tear in reality. As it drew closer, tentacles unfurled from its head, drifting behind it like ink bleeding through water.

Its limbs were thin and wrong, arms sagging with torn flesh that swayed behind like tattered cloth. Its torso stretched too long, its legs stunted and jerking like broken marionettes. Bone—porcelain-white and gleaming—jutted through the gaps in its rib cage.

Its skin was leathery and grey, impossibly dry yet glistening in the light. Beneath it, bulging veins slithered along its form, twitching as though alive—like leeches trapped just under the surface.

It reached out for me. Behind it, the tentacles pulsed and writhed, stretching high above, swaying like weeds in deep water. I followed them upward. At first, I couldn’t tell what I was seeing. A shape, suspended in the dark—white, trembling— Then I realized. Daria.

The tentacles—God—were coming from her. They spilled out from between her legs, twisting, pulsing, impossibly alive. Her pregnant belly had been split wide, dried blood crusted at the edges. Her skin was stark white, veined and brittle. Her once-red hair had gone ghostly pale, clinging to her face in damp strands.

Her eyes drooped, her mouth hung half open—like she'd screamed herself hoarse and then simply stopped.

Her skin cracked like dry porcelain, flaking at the edges. She looked ancient. Drained. Dead.

But she was still looking at me.

My scream echoed in my ears as I sat bolt upright. The marigolds were gone—but the image of her white hair still clung to the inside of my skull. The silence pressed in. No moon. No marigolds. Just the hum of the box fan and Daria’s gentle breathing—soft, steady, normal. I was back.

Sweat clung to my skin, soaking the sheets beneath me. I shivered, despite the boiling room, our AC had broken. I turned to look at Daria. The memory of her—twisted, hollowed out, fused with that creature—flashed behind my eyes. But she lay beside me, untouched. Her hair fell across her face like a curtain. I could just make out her closed eyelids, her parted lips, the soft snore rising and falling every few seconds. One hand rested protectively over her belly; the other stretched beneath her pillow and dangled off the edge of the mattress. It would be numb when she woke. Daria looked like she was having the best sleep of her life.

I’ve been having these nightmares ever since Daria got pregnant. They’ve gradually been getting worse. Each time, the thing comes a little closer. But this was the first time she was present.

That changed everything.

Cold dread pooled in my gut. In the dream, I knew that it came from her. Somehow. I felt sick. Her face had been so pale, her eyes hollow, her hair thin and stringy like old threads. Her body cracked and frail. Drained.

Just a dream, I told myself. Just a nightmare.

 But it didn’t feel like one

I slipped out of bed as carefully as I could, trying not to wake Daria, and shuffled into the bathroom.

In the mirror, my brown eyes stared back—wide, sunken, bloodshot. My skin looked pale, almost sickly. I splashed cold water on my face. A little color came back, I looked just a bit better.

That’s when I saw it. A single grey hair, curled against the brown. I reached to smooth it into the rest—and came away with a small tuft.

I froze.

My heart thudded in my chest, just a beat faster than before.

 Just stress.

 It has to be.

3:12 a.m.

 The dim glow of the bathroom clock blinked above the mirror.

I wasn’t going to be able to get back to sleep.

I paused at the door and glanced back. Daria had rolled over, facing the wall now, hair spilling across her shoulder like it always did. We’d only been married a year, but it already felt impossible to remember life before her. Our anniversary was coming up. I still had no idea what to get her.

I stepped into the kitchen and flicked on the light.

Something moved—fast. A dark shape.

A tentacle slithered into the shadows of the living room.

My breath caught. I rushed forward, flipped on the living room light.

Nothing. 

I stood there for a long second, staring at the empty floor.

 I’m just tired.

I went back to the stove, turned on the burner, and tossed some bacon into the pan.

Daria’s dead eyes flashed across my mind—staring, white, empty.

My grip slipped, I fumbled with the carton, nearly dropping the eggs. As I tried to steady myself my hip knocked into the fridge door.. The door bounced off the counter with a loud thud.

I froze, heart in my throat, listening for any sign that Daria had woken up.

Silence.

I put the eggs back and closed the fridge softly this time.

I gripped the counter, breathing slow.

I need to get a handle on this.

I’ve got bills to pay. A real estate deal to close. Groceries to buy. Two car payments. Medication insurance won’t cover. And Daria—Daria’s pregnant. The baby’s coming soon.

I absolutely can’t afford to fall apart now.

Thank God my dad gave us this house. If we had rent or mortgage payments on top of everything else… I don’t know how we’d manage.

I stared at the sizzling bacon.

Daria won’t be up for another hour.

Why the hell am I making breakfast?

Daria shuffled into the kitchen at exactly 5:05, clutching her arm like it had betrayed her. Breakfast was ready—eggs steaming, bacon crackling faintly in the cooling pan. The room still held a trace of the peppery grease smell, mixing with the soft hum of the fridge.

She dragged her feet toward me, half-asleep, and leaned her forehead into my chest with a dramatic sigh.

“James, my arm’s asleep again,” she groaned. Her red hair was a tangle of wild strands, sticking out like she'd been electrocuted in her sleep. I always wondered how she managed to wrestle it straight by morning.

She tilted her chin up, green eyes locking onto mine like it took effort to keep them open.

 “What’d you make?”

“Bacon and eggs,” I said.

She rolled her eyes and let out a mock whine. “You always make that. Lucky for you it’s my favorite.”

I turned toward the living room, grabbing my keys from the hook.

“You’re not eating with me?” she asked, faking a wounded tone.

“Daria, I keep telling you—if you want to eat with me, you’ve gotta be up by 4:30.”

She slumped into the chair and laid her head on the table, cheek to the wood. “I got a baby in me. I need, like, sixteen hours of sleep now. It’s only fair. And it’s not my fault you work stupid early.”

I shrugged, rinsing out my coffee mug. “McDonald’s pays just enough to keep the lights on. And somebody doesn’t have a job.”

She stabbed her fork in my direction, mock-offended. “Don’t be throwing around the J-word in my kitchen. You told me to quit, remember?”

“At Subway,” I said, sighing with exaggerated suffering. “And I’m not making my pregnant wife work, Daria. If you do get a job, I might quit mine and start drinking beer for breakfast. Maybe gamble. Maybe start throwing the bottles.”

She giggled, eyes crinkling. “Don’t wanna risk it, do we, James.”

I walked over and kissed her on the forehead. “Hey. Dad’s talking about handing me the Agency. Mom’s been on his case to retire early.”

She arched an eyebrow. “So… does that mean you can finally stop flipping burgers?”

“Not a chance. I’m going to be a real estate broker and a fry cook. Dreams do come true.”

Outside, the summer morning air was cool against my skin. The sky was soft and pale—no stars left, just the early wash of blue and the faint outline of the moon, already fading.

I got into the car and backed out slowly, gravel crunching under the tires. As I shifted into drive, something made me pause.

I glanced up at the bedroom window.

A figure stood behind the curtain—still, silent, framed in the pale light. Watching.

I swallowed.

 Probably Daria.

My shift at McDonald’s dragged. A man threw a tantrum over his pancakes being “too fluffy.” I stared at him blankly and wondered if I was still dreaming.

At 9:30, I drove across town to my dad’s real estate firm, my second job.

I finally closed a deal—small house, barely held together, but the couple was desperate. Their little boy had wandered through the empty rooms like he was discovering treasure. Probably three years old, maybe four. I really hope my kid can grow up with the same wonder.

The house sold for $100,000. A 3% commission meant $3,000 in my pocket. Enough to breathe for a month.

After the paperwork, I sat back in my chair and stared at the ceiling, eyes gritty from lack of sleep. Then Dad walked in.

His hair was starting to grey at the temples, but his grin was as smug as ever. “James,” he said, leaning against the doorframe, “how’s the babymaker?”

“It’s Daria.” I muttered. “She’s okay. We’re okay.”

He raised an eyebrow. “You’re cranky. That means she’s healthy.”

“We got the house sold.” I pushed the paperwork toward him. “You want your half of the commission?”

He shook his head. “Hell no. You need it more than I do. If I don’t retire soon, I’m never going to.”

I forced a smile. “That’s the plan. I need the agency. I need out of McDonald’s.”

“The housing market’s garbage, James.” He sighed. “If I’d known, I would’ve gone into rentals.”

“Sold a one-bed, one-bath shack today for six figures. We live in a world of miracles.” I stated.

He laughed, rubbing his chin. “That house I gave you—I paid the same back in… Um… I believe it was 1990, my first house. I lived in it with my 1st Wife before… well, you know.” His face fell for a second then he slapped the door frame, his face lighting up again “You know that house has a balcony? You and Daria should use it more. I want to see pictures.”

There was an awkward pause

He shuffled in place, turned to leave, stopped and then finally turned back. “Your mom told me that you’ve been having nightmares.”

I went still.

“If you ever need to talk,” he said, quieter now, “you know I’m here, right?”

I nodded. “It’s just stress…” 

He looked at me concerned 

“I even found a grey hair this morning.” I added trying to end the subject.

His face tightened. Then he nodded and left.

—

At 2:30 I left to go back and finish my day working at McDonalds.

My shift finally ended at 6 p.m.

Daria called as I pulled out of the parking lot.

Her voice was bright with excitement. “Jamie! I got us a pizza.”

I frowned, gripping the wheel. “Yeah? What kind?”

“Supreme.”

I paused. “…Seriously?”

“Jamie?”

I sighed. “Daria, one day I really am gonna start throwing beer bottles at you.”

She laughed, the sound soft and familiar in my ear. “You love me.”

“Sure. But not more than I hate olives.”

“Suit yourself,” she said. “But you better guard that cheese pizza you’re about to buy. I might eat it while you’re asleep.”

I could still hear her giggling as she hung up.

I pictured her sprawled out on the couch, a pizza box balanced on her belly, hair sticking up like wild red grass.

Warmth settled over me.

 I felt a stupid grin spread across my face.

Then the image of that thing flickered through my mind.

The smile vanished.

Fifteen minutes later, I walked through the door, pizza box in hand. Daria was exactly where I’d imagined her: slouched on the couch, belly pushing up against the stretched fabric of her nightgown, her wild red hair pointing in every direction like she’d been struck by lightning.

“Hey James, welcome home,” she said with a lazy wave.

The slight smell of bleach lingered in the air.

“Daria… did you clean?”

She sheepishly slid her pizza slice back into the box. “I—uhh… yeah?”

I sighed and opened my own box.

 “Daria… you know I don’t want you doing that stuff right now.”

Her eyes narrowed.

“It doesn’t get done, James. You work like  twelve hours a day,” she said, voice tight with concern.

I sat down next to her, leaning back into the couch cushions.

I glanced at Daria expecting more, but she was transfixed on the TV.

She was watching that one SpongeBob episode—Rock-a-Bye Bivalve, where they raise a baby clam.

We ate in silence, Daria, focused on Spongebob, and I, happy to be home.

“Daria,” I said softly.

“Yup?”

“You know the beer bottle thing… it’s a joke. I’d never actually do that.”

She paused, looked over, her left eyebrow raised.

“James, I may not have had the best grades, but I know when you’re joking.”

She slid the half-empty pizza box onto the table, scooted toward me awkwardly, and laid her head on my shoulder. Her hand found the top of mine.

“But seriously… thanks, Jamie.”

“For what?”

She shrugged, “Just in case.”

I lay there, eyes wired shut, heart tight in my chest like a fist refusing to unclench.

 The air felt wrong—thick, heavy—and cold dread trickled down my spine like melting ice.

I didn’t know why.

 But I felt it.

 Something was going to happen.

Daria had fallen asleep before I even switched off the light. Her breathing was slow, steady, and soft. For a moment, that rhythm eased something in me.

Then—

 a sound.

Wet.

 Slithering.

My eyes snapped open.

It was in the corner.

Still. Towering. Watching.

Moonlight filtered through the curtains, glinting off its leathery, grey skin. Tentacles unraveled from its head—rising like smoke, then slipping across the ceiling with a silent, serpentine grace.

I couldn’t move.

 Couldn’t blink.

 Not out of fear—

 out of instinct.

 Like moving would make it real.

It wasn’t looking at me.

 Its head was tilted toward Daria.

I followed its gaze.

The tentacles crept toward her—slow, pulsing cords that writhed across the ceiling, veined like they carried some thick, black blood.

Adrenaline snapped through me.

I lunged from the bed, slapped the light switch.

A harsh flicker. Light flooded the room.

Daria stirred, eyes barely open.

 “James… wha—are you okay?”

I turned.

The tentacles snapped back into the dark, as if burned by the light.

 But the thing was still there—bones gleaming through shredded flesh, like broken porcelain crammed into meat. Its skin hung in ragged strips, trailing across the floor like unraveling bandages.

“I… I’m okay,” I croaked, throat raw and dry.

She squinted at me. “You sure?”

I nodded too fast and turned the light off.

But I didn’t lie down.

I sat on the edge of the bed.

 Watching.

It didn’t leave.

The slithering returned—low and wet, like something breathing through water. The thing didn’t move. Didn’t blink. But it watched me. Patient. Present.

 A hunter with all the time in the world.

Daria’s breathing evened out again—soft and rhythmic. Comforting. Human.

But the thing stayed.

 All night.

Headlights passed outside, sweeping over the room, but never reached the corner.

 The fan hummed faintly behind me.

 And the creature stood, silent, absolute.

I stayed frozen—muscles locked, nerves frayed.

It didn’t need to move.

Then, after what felt like a lifetime, my alarm shrieked.

4:30 a.m.

I didn’t flinch.

 Neither did it.

I stared ahead, breath caught in my throat.

 Then blinked.

The corner was empty.

Daria stirred behind me. “What is he doing…” she mumbled.

The alarm stopped.

 I felt her hand on my shoulder—gentle, grounding.

She pulled me down beside her, wrapping an arm across my chest.

I turned toward her.

Her eyes met mine.

 Sharp. Awake. Concerned.

“You didn’t move,” she said softly. “You were in that same spot when I fell asleep.”

 She glanced at the clock. “You’re never here at 4:30.”

I pulled her close and buried my face in her hair.

 It smelled like lavender and skin.

“I couldn’t sleep,” I whispered.

A lie.

She cupped my cheek, her thumb brushing beneath my eye.

Warmth bled into me.

 Before I could drift off, she tugged me gently to her chest. One hand rubbed slow circles into my back; the other combed through my hair.

“Okay,” she whispered again, more firmly now. “But James… don’t sit there like that again. And hit your alarm when it rings. Please.”

I got up before I could fall asleep in her arms.

In the kitchen, I cooked in silence.

 Left the house before she could even come downstairs.

As I pulled out of the driveway, the living room light flicked on.

 The curtains shifted.

Daria’s face appeared in the window.

I couldn’t make out her expression.

—

The day was torturous.

 The first half of my McDonald’s shift crawled by.

 Fifteen customers would order, I’d serve them, then check the clock—only five minutes had passed.

At 9:45, I stumbled out and into my car. Fighting sleep, I turned the key and shifted into reverse.

At the intersection, I thought the light was green.

 Blinked.

 It was red.

I was halfway through before I realized. Cars slammed their brakes. Even over the music blaring to keep me awake, I heard the screech of tires.

Thank God no one got hit.

Still, I could already feel the ticket draining my checking account.

At 10:00 I walked into the wrong building—a hair salon next to the agency.

Mary looked up from her desk when I finally made it into the agency door. “You okay?”

“Yeah, yeah…” I mumbled, heading straight for the coffee pot.

Luckily, she’d just made a fresh batch.

 McDonald’s coffee just wasn’t cutting it.

I poured a cup, didn’t wait for it to cool. I downed it in one go. It burned my mouth, throat, stomach.

But I was awake.

“James! I just made that! Are you okay?” Mary’s hand flew to her chin.

I coughed. “Yeah... just had a rough night.”

Her face softened. “Is it about Daria? Is everything okay?”

She touched my arm—gentle, maternal concern.

“Yeah... pregnancy stuff. I don’t know how you guys do it.” I took the easy excuse.

She nodded, distracted, then perked up. “Oh! Mr. Carter said to give you this.” She handed me a sheet of paper with a sticky note attached.

“Let’s see what Dad’s got for me today…”

The note read:

“James, I’m busy today. Can you go set up this house for sale? Just needs to be listed and stuff. I’ll make it worth your time—$500.”

So... not my listing.

I sighed and skimmed the sheet. Address, square footage, photos. All there.

I slumped into the chair, cursing my economic reality. I’d been hoping to nap in my office chair.

“I can do it for you if you want,” Mary said, reading over my shoulder.

I shrugged. “Nah. I got it.”

I grabbed a second coffee and headed back out.

—

The house was overgrown. The listing photo made it look like a magazine cover. Now, weeds climbed up the porch rail.

I sighed and started calling landscaping companies.

 First call: busy.

 Second call: voicemail.

 Third: booked until next week.

Of course. It’s Friday.

I texted my dad:

“Do they have a mower here?”

His reply was immediate:

“Yes. Shed key under front mat w/ door key. Thanks. Also a weed eater in there.”

The push mower was a beast—thank God. It cut through the high grass like butter.

The weed eater, on the other hand, was a disaster. I had to reset the string three times.

But eventually, I got it done. Swept the sidewalk, staked the “For Sale” sign into the dirt, took a few pictures, and listed the place back at the office.

I was late to my second McDonald’s shift. I was scared I Was going to get reprimanded. I walked in the door. The manager just laughed and told me to stay to make up the difference.

My manager’s cool about the weird hours, thank God.

I pulled into our driveway at 8:30.

The sun was already dipping, staining the sky with orange and pink streaks.

My body felt hollow. I almost fell asleep leaning against the front door. It was only the jingle of my keys that kept me upright.

I stepped inside.

The house was dark and quiet—but warm. Still welcoming.

I headed to the kitchen, set my stuff down.

Two empty pizza boxes sat on the table. I felt a pang of disappointment. I was looking forward to having some.

 Yesterday’s dinner. Both boxes cleaned out by her.

I guess it’s peanut butter sandwiches for me.

I fixed the plate and walked into the bedroom—expecting to find her curled up in bed.

The bed was untouched, unmade. Quilt still balled from this morning.

I turned, ready to search—then saw her.

Through the window.

Out on the balcony.

I opened the door and stepped outside, plate in hand.

Daria was sitting in one of the chairs I’d bought this spring—two big ones and a little one.

She had her headphones on, nodding along to a rhythm only she could hear.

Her hair was straight now, the usual wildness tamed, at least for the moment.

She tapped her foot to the beat, drumming softly on a pillow in her lap like it was a snare. She was singing under her breath, just loud enough to move her lips—too soft for me to make out the words.

The setting sun caught her hair, setting it aglow. Her pale, freckled skin shimmered in the orange light, so radiant it almost looked painted.

She looked so alive. So beautiful. So her.

I glanced down at her phone on the table beside her.

She still hadn’t noticed me.

She was listening to Kiss Me by Sixpence None the Richer.

 I’d never heard it before.

She looked over and saw me. Her face lit up.

“Hey!” she shouted, waving furiously.

She pulled off her headphones, set them beside her phone, and hopped up. She wrapped her arms around my neck and kissed me, then leaned over my shoulder in a tight hug.

I noticed a heating pad on the chair where she’d been sitting.

She let go and stepped back. “Welcome home, James.”

She glanced at her phone. “You’re later than usual.”

“Yeah, sorry. Had to work late.” I sank into one of the chairs.

She plopped down on my lap, studying me.

“James, you don’t look so good.”

She touched my cheek. “Oh my God, you’re so pale.”

“Didn’t sleep well last night.”

She frowned. “James… you didn’t sleep at all.”

She sighed. “Well, you better sleep tonight. I’ll wake you up at 4:30.”

“I don’t need to be at work till nine. But I won’t be back home till seven.”

She smiled and looked up at the darkening sky.

 “It’s going to be a full moon tonight.”

I chuckled. “Don’t know if I’ll make it that long.”

There was a long silence.

She leaned her head against my shoulder, eyes misty.

“I’m so excited,” she whispered. “We’re going to be mom and dad.”

She ran her hand through my hair.

“First day of preschool… first day of school… graduation… we’ll see him off to college.”

She smiled. “I love you.”

“Love you too, Daria,” I murmured, struggling to keep my eyes open.

She giggled. “James, let’s get you to bed.”

I shivered as she stood.

She pulled me to my feet. I could barely keep my balance—I was that tired.

She led me inside, sat me on the bed, and undressed me like a child.

I felt warm all over as she laid me down and pulled the covers over me.

“Nighty night, Jamie.”

I felt her crawl into bed behind me. Her arms wrapped around my chest.

And I was out.

 —

I felt icy.

I was in the field again.

The full moon loomed overhead—impossibly large, so close I could see its scars. A cold breeze slid down my spine like a whisper.

The marigolds were brighter than ever, glowing like lanterns. Petals blanketed the ground, hiding the grass beneath, which had turned from green to a brittle, corpse-grey.

I was terrified—but I didn’t move. I stared toward the spot where the thing always entered.

I blinked.

And there it was.

The tentacles unfurled first, curling like smoke through the air.

 Daria was part of them now—impaled and suspended, a marionette strung by meat.

This time, the tentacles didn’t just emerge from her.

 They ran through her—threaded under her skin like pulsating veins, bulging and twitching.

 A bundle of them spilled from her mouth in a wet, choking tangle, still moving.

Her belly was gone. Flattened. The skin around her torso drifted like fabric underwater—thin, weightless, empty.

Then the moon changed.

Its white glow deepened into blue.

 The surface shimmered—rippled, fluid.

 Landmasses began to rise: first Eurasia, then the Americas.

It wasn’t the moon.

It was Earth.

Whole. Radiant. Perfect.

I looked back to the marigolds.

 They were so bright now they burned. My eyes watered.

Then the Earth cracked—like an egg.

A jagged line split the globe in half.

 The continents fractured.

 The oceans boiled into steam.

Fire gushed from the core. Not lava—light. Blinding, holy, wrong.

Cities folded in on themselves, sucked into spirals. Skyscrapers bent like wet paper. Forests went up in columns of ash.

People screamed—not just dying, but unraveling.

 I saw flesh peeling from bone, souls turned inside out.

 I saw families hugging as they dissolved, praying to gods that didn’t come.

 I saw Daria, duplicated a thousand times—each version split, split, and split again, until she was just fragments of skin in the fire.

I saw me—dozens of versions. Crawling. Burning. Watching.

Then, at the shattered core of the world, something emerged.

It had no form I could understand—just light and motion and vast, unknowable hunger.

I tried to look at it.

I couldn’t.

It radiated light, but I saw nothing. My brain refused to shape it.

Then tentacles erupted outward—towering, endless. They wrapped around the edges of the universe, pulling everything in.

They reached for me.

A scream ripped from my chest—

Mine.

I woke up.

I was sitting straight up in bed. Daria snored softly beside me.

In a daze, I slid out from under the covers and stumbled into the bathroom. My eyes flicked up to the clock above the mirror.

3:12 a.m.

I sighed—but the breath caught in my throat.

It was behind me.

In the mirror, I saw it standing there. Its reflection loomed over my shoulder, silent and watching.

I spun around—nothing.

I turned back.

It was still in the mirror. Closer now. One of its tentacles reached toward me.

Before I could react, something thick and rotten flooded my mouth. I gagged on the slime, the taste of decay choking me. I couldn’t breathe. My throat sealed shut.

I looked in the mirror again.

It was gone.

But I still couldn’t breathe.

My knees hit the tile. I clawed at the countertop, vision swimming. The pressure behind my eyes was unbearable.

I looked up—just in time to see my own eyes being forced out of my head in the mirror.

Then everything went black.

—

I jerked awake.

Daria flinched beside me, pulling back quickly.

“James! Oh my God, don’t scare me like that.”

 She gave a nervous laugh, brushing the hair from her face.

The clock read 7:30.

Daria climbed on top of me with a grin.

 “Welcome back to the land of the living,” she giggled. “You wake up like someone being resuscitated.”

“Baby Archibald’s kicking,” she said, rubbing her belly with a smile.

“Really?” I placed my hand gently on her stomach.

 The kick came—sudden and sharp, like a muscle twitch just beneath warm skin. I half expected to see a tiny footprint stretch the fabric.

I paused. “We’re not naming our baby Archibald.”

She chuckled. “Well, then you better help me pick something, or I’m going with a long, boring name. He won’t get any ladies that way—and we don’t want that.”

In the shower, I let the hot water run over my shoulders and tried to stop thinking about the dream.

 But it clung to me like steam.

What does it even mean?

 Is this just sleep deprivation and nerves?

 Or is our baby going to... end the world?

I rubbed my eyes and glanced out through the fogged shower door. My reflection stared back in the mirror. My eyes looked normal. Clear.

But something was off.

I was thinner than usual. Hollow, maybe. Just stress, I told myself. Probably skipped too many meals this week. I turned away before I could think too hard about it.

Daria had made breakfast.

The smell of chocolate chip pancakes hit me first—her second favorite. Scrambled eggs were still sizzling on the burner, nearly forgotten.

She stood over the griddle in an apron that didn’t quite fit anymore, her full belly pulling the fabric taut. She was laser-focused on the pancakes, flipping them with mechanical precision.

She didn’t notice the eggs burning.

I walked over, turned off the burner, cut them up with a spatula, and slid them into a bowl.

“Thanks, James. I didn’t even realize,” she said softly.

I glanced up.

She was looking at me, her pancakes forgotten. 

“uh, your pancakes are done,” I muttered,

“Oh!” She spun around fumbling for the burner knob.

Breakfast was good. I prefer normal pancakes, but it was worth it just to see Daria happy.

 She closed her eyes on the first bite, smiling like it was the best thing she’d tasted in years.

Then—

Daria was replaced with the thing, it’s tentacles flew toward me.

I blinked.

 Back to normal.

Daria was pointing her fork at me, a bit of pancake dangling from the tines.

“So what are we going to tell him, James?”

I stared at her.

“Sorry—what?”

She sighed, exaggerated and playful. “The baby. What do we tell him when he asks why the grass is green?”

 She stabbed another bite, eyes narrowed in mock seriousness.

 “When he can talk, obviously.”

“Oh. Uh... chlorophyll,” I said. “It absorbs everything but green light.”

She raised an eyebrow.

I stumbled. “We’ll dumb it down. Make it cute. So he understands.”

She nodded, already moving on.

“What about the sky? Why’s it—”

Her phone chimed from the pocket of her apron. She pulled it out and glanced at the screen.

Her face lit up.

“They’re doing the growth scan on Monday,” she said brightly. Then, softer: “Will you be able to come this time?”

I hesitated, running through my mental schedule.

“What time?”

“One o’clock.”

“I’ll talk to Dad. I’m sure he’ll let me go if I bring him pictures.” I smirked. “But I have to be at McDonald’s by two.”

She nodded, tucking her phone away.

My day at work was utterly mind-numbing.

 No real estate shift today—just a long McDonald’s stretch from 9:00 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.

It was Saturday. I watched happy parents shuffle in with their kids. Some hid behind their parents as they ordered Happy Meals in hushed voices. Others shouted their orders with big smiles, always slightly mispronounced.

It felt like I was supposed to be reminded of something.

Most days, it's just tired people wanting something cheap and greasy. But today? Today it was all kids.

And the whole shift, I couldn’t stop thinking.

About the nightmares.

 The hallucinations.

 The pressure.

 Two jobs.

 Daria’s student loans.

 The baby arriving next month.

 Groceries. Insurance. The damn AC unit that probably won’t survive the summer.

I kept punching the wrong buttons on the register. Every time, I cursed under my breath. The manager noticed. He shook his head and walked off.

If I get fired… I don’t know what I’ll do. McDonald’s is the closest job I have. Losing it would mean more gas, more time, more strain.

Those thoughts played on repeat in my mind while I waited at Little Caesars. I ordered a half-supreme, half-cheese pizza and stood there watching the rain as the worker boxed it.

Then my phone rang.

I fumbled the pizza onto the dash and snatched the phone up.

Daria’s voice came through, quiet and broken. “I… James…”

My stomach tightened. “What’s wrong? Are you okay?”

There was a second of silence. Then a sharp pop of static.

 “James,” she said again, voice cracking, “I need you here. I had an accident…”

I froze.

“What happened?” I asked, panicked. My voice sounded hoarse, too loud.

“Don’t freak out… just please come. Come home.”

I drove faster than I should’ve. Rain poured hard, turning the road into a misty blur. My wipers were useless at full speed. I tapped the wheel nervously at red lights, blasted through yellow ones.

I felt the car straining as I pulled into the driveway. Tires squealed. I slammed the brakes.

I ran through the rain, fumbled the keys at the door, swore under my breath. My hands were shaking.

I burst inside, soaked through.

And there she was—leaning against the kitchen table. Eyes red and puffy. But she was okay.

 I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding.

I stepped into the kitchen. A small plastic bucket lay tipped over, water spreading across the tile and soaking into the hardwood.

I walked up to Daria, still dizzy with relief, and pulled her into a tight hug. I kissed the top of her head.

Then I stepped away, bent down, and picked up the bucket.

 That’s when I noticed the wet stain running down her nightgown.

“James…” she started, her voice trembling. “I was just washing the dishes, when… it happened.”

 She tried to swallow the words. “I didn’t mean to—I tried to clean it, but I knocked over the bucket.”

She covered her face with both hands. “I can’t even bend down to dry it up.”

I didn’t say anything. I just walked into the bathroom, grabbed some towels, and returned.

 I dropped them on the floor and slowly began soaking up the water, one towel at a time.

“Are you mad at me?” she asked quietly, tears hitting the tile.

“I didn’t mean to scare you, I just…” Her voice cracked. “I feel so useless. You do everything, and I just… I don’t even know why I’m here.” 

I put the bucket and mop back in the closet. The sound of the door clicking shut echoed a little too loud in the quiet house.

I walked over to Daria and put my arm around her. She leaned into me, avoiding eye contact.

“It’s alright, Daria. It happens,” I said softly.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered.

“Hey.” I cupped her cheek, gently turning her toward me. Her eyes were wet, glassy. I kissed her forehead. “You don’t have to be sorry. You’re growing a person. That’s more than enough.”

She gave a shaky breath, trying to smile but failing.

“Ok, let’s get you cleaned up,” I said. “Bath or shower?”

“Bath,” she murmured.

I ran the water, adjusting the temperature with practiced care. I added the lavender stuff she likes—bought on a whim during one of our grocery runs last month.

While the tub filled, I helped her peel off her soaked nightgown and eased her into the warm water. She sighed as she sank in.

I sat beside the tub on the floor, one arm resting on the edge.

“You know,” she said after a while, eyes half-closed, “I thought I’d be good at this. Motherhood. But I just feel like... a burden.”

I didn’t have a perfect answer. Just reached in and brushed my fingers over her arm beneath the water.

“You’re not,” I said. 

She sniffled

“Thanks for coming home James.”

“Just call when you need me.” 

She closed her eyes again.

The faucet dripped. The house was quiet. Just the hum of the AC.

I felt at peace. 

I hope all this stress doesn’t affect the baby.

The hum of the AC was steady. But for a second, I swore I heard something slithering in the ductwork. Just water, I told myself. Just the pipes.

Sleep came hard that night.

 Daria was already out, curled beneath the quilt.

 The AC had cut off hours ago.

 For once, the house was cold.

Outside, cars hissed along the wet asphalt, their headlights sweeping across the ceiling like ghosts.

 Nothing else moved. Just the soft hum of silence.

 Then—

 A faint slither.

 Maybe a pipe.

 Maybe the house settling.

 Probably.

My eyelids grew heavy.

 The room pulsed dim.

 Just as I slipped beneath the surface of sleep—

 The bathroom light snapped on.

 And something stood in the doorway.

Monday morning was quiet. Peaceful, even.

I woke up at 4:00 a.m. sharp—no nightmare, no sweat-drenched sheets, no lingering screams clawing their way out of my throat.

Just... silence.

The shower felt warmer than usual, like it was trying to lull me back to sleep. I stood there longer than I meant to, letting it run over my face. Steam clung to the mirror, but I wiped it away out of habit.

I looked okay. Normal, maybe. My skin wasn’t as pale. I couldn’t find the grey hair anymore—just soft brown. My eyes looked tired, sure, but less... exhausted. Like someone had rewound me a few days.

I actually felt hungry. I wanted to make breakfast.

I headed downstairs, a little unsteady, but upright. Head high.

The light switch clicked under my fingers. The kitchen blinked to life.

And there they were.

Tentacles.

They slithered in through the living room like they’d always been there—slow and deliberate, crawling across the floor in perfect silence.

My blood turned to ice. My skin prickled all over.

I just... watched.

Then I moved.

The living room was dim. I didn’t remember turning off that lamp in the corner, but it was dark now. The thing stood just beside the front door. Its tentacles coiled around its body, spiraling down to the floor, threading through the carpet fibers like roots.

It didn’t move. Didn’t even twitch.

But I could feel it watching me, it’s hateful gaze piercing my soul, though it had no eyes.

I walked back into the kitchen. My hands went on autopilot: eggs, pan, salt. My heartbeat thudded behind my teeth the whole time. I kept catching glimpses of it in my peripheral vision—never direct, never center frame. Just shadows at the edge of thought.

I plated the eggs. They looked fine. Like any other Monday.

At 5:07, I heard her.

“Hey James,” Daria mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.

I turned slightly, keeping the thing just out of view. Daria wrapped her arms around my waist, resting her face between my shoulder blades.

“James, I slept horribly,” she groaned, half-pouting.

I turned to her, leaving the bowl on the counter. Her hair was tangled. Her eyes were puffy. She looked soft, human. Warm.

“Are you okay?” I asked, folding her into a hug. I kissed the crown of her head.

She nodded her head lazily.

“I love you, Daria,” I whispered.

She murmured something into my back—something like “love you more.”

I didn’t look at the thing again.

1qtg0e7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1qtg0e7/horrible_stay_at_sls/,Horrible stay at SLS,"SLS playa mujeres Mexico - the worst ‘luxury’ resort we’ve ever been to - the worst service experience.

THEFT BY STAFF FROM OUR SAFE. No apology from a manager. Complete lack of professionalism from staff - no manager response and no compensation.

“Elite” upgrade is a scam - no seperate check in process, we were checked in same lobby as our two other families that traveled with us that did not book elite. They actually gave our stroller to a different family on our floor by mistake and luckily we saw it happen and notified them.

Dinner Reservations - service is slow, takes 2.5 hours to eat dinner each night which is not easy when ur traveling with two kids. Took about 25 mins to just get our drinks and get offered water at our table. Met other guests at the resort who stayed for 7 days and were only able to secure 2 dinner reservations.

Restaurant closures - lunch and dinner buffets closed which they don’t tell you about prior to arrival. They give some excuse about how the resort is not at capacity to open the buffet Our friends had to settle for room service for two nights because they were unable to get a table at dinner

NOT ALLERGEN FRIENDLY!!! Was always left with no options for my daughters that have nut allergies for desserts and most mains at the restaurants. Inquired about nut free options at the coffee shop and was told “I don’t know lady” by the staff working there. Contamination of nuts in all the toppings. Not at all what you would expect from a luxury resort to be this careless with common allergens.

My husband was unfortunately bitten by a barracuda fish in the water which is obviously not the resorts fault how’ve the lifeguard told him the manager will come check on you and no one came to check on him at all. There’s no warnings that there are no barracudas in the shallow water at the beach. Luckily it was an adult that was bit and not a child.

The pools are NOT HEATED AT ALL!! Not even warm enough for adults to swim.

Very dirty common areas. There was a blood stain infront of the elevator in tower 2 that was not cleaned up for the entirety of our stay. I didn’t see anyone mopping the hallways. There was chocolate ice cream spilled in the elevator and that was left on the floor for 2 days.

Not a luxury feeling - rooms are very small. The sofa bed had a stain and a rip on it as well

Green MOLD in the Cheese at the Breakfast buffet. We notified the waiters and they just shrugged it off

If your kids want to enjoy their vacation and enjoy swimming in the water comfortably and you want to feel pampered/taken care of this is not the resort for you - so many better options out there. We were robbed and still haven’t received an apology or any compensation

1qtg0cz,https://www.reddit.com/r/JaggedAlliance3/comments/1qtg0cz/my_tips_for_time_is_money_best_endings_mi_dead_is/,"My tips for ""Time is Money + Best Endings + MI + Dead is Dead"" Run","Just did it - wasn't that bad, a few tips from how I did it:

Leader Team 1 - IMP

Leader Team 2 - Raider

This means

MEC Team 1 - Livewire (cannot be with Raider), which means

MEC Team 2 - Vicki, which means

MED Team 2 - Dr. Q, which means

MED Team 1 - MD (need MED 80+ for MED checks, so no Fox, no Thor), which means

FIDEL Team 2 - Needed for PSY & EXP for Team 2 BECAUSE

IMP needs to be PSY for Team 1 - only other option.  You don't need PSY on both teams, but this gives you flexibility to reunite the Coffee Beans to let you just keep one merc there (e.g., Larry or Flay) doing nothing with no militia to defend this sector.  Grannies will die,  but they will defend the sector.

AND THEREFORE THOR Team 2 - because you need him for WIS checks (and good for 2ndary med treatment ops and herbs are always good)

so, IF Fidel Team 2, then

BARRY Team 1 EXP

AND you need Melee for Bonecrusher (unless you want to save-scum) and to save on ammo, as well as kill bosses (e.g., early Pierre).  You want one on both teams to max flexibility.  Note Dr. Q's special against Bonecrusher works, but is weird as Bonecrusher will get up from unconscious status, so be careful.  Blood is the obvious choice for Team 1.

THEREFORE:

Team 1

IMP - LDR & PSY

Livewire - MEC & WIS, second for Treatment ops

MD - MED & WIS

Barry - EXP & WIS, second for Repair ops

Blood - Melee, and grenade thrower

.

Team 2

Raider - LDR

Vicki - MEC & Grenades

Dr. Q - MED, Melee & grenades

Fidel - EXP & PSY

AND Thor - WIS checks, secondary medic

Combat roles:

Team 1

IMP:  Early game melee / sniper.  Late game OW build - I gave mine Heavy Weapons and Auto Weapons Traits.  Note, I gimped Health to 55 and raised MRK to 70 (if I recall), because you are limited by Livewire's 55 Health anyway.  I wonder if you should gimp WIS on IMP, as stat gains are relatively small in a time-is-money run and instead increasing EXP to allow for grenades.  I would recommend trying that instead.

Livewire:  Morale (WIS) Sniper, late game Assault Rifle grenade launcher

MD:  Morale (WIS) Sniper.  I recommend Gold Fever, as the high aim bonus helps overcome his low marksmanship.

Barry:  Early game Melee to increase his STR to 80 ASAP so he can get tier 2 STR perks.  Mid to late game shotgun / grenadier.  FEED HIM ALL THE STR MAGS and MAYBE you can get him to 90 STR for the tier 3 STR perks.  OR

Blood:  Melee beast, grenades.  FEED him  all the STR mags to get him to 90 STR for Tier 3 perks.

Team 2 - pretty obvious here I think.  Vicki can do just about anything, as can Thor who makes a good WIS Sniper (don't ignore his melee) and Fidel.  Raider's fairly useless.  My team 2 here was weak with Auto Weapons.

Hiring:

Minimum contracts (3 or 4 days, whatever it is) to blitz and loot as fast as you can.  DO NOT BE TEMPTED TO HIRE PARTIAL TEAMS.  If you hire less than a full team, your later hires will have a hard time catching up to your LDR.  Hire as soon as you can though, even if you're worried about being able to pay them later.  Don't worry, you will loot fast enough.  Only later, when you have money, feel comfy you will be able to hire Team 3 around World Flip, have Pentagruel, etc., then hire for 7 days.  Maybe.  But then switch back to 4 days for end game.

MAKE SURE TO CLEAR 4 FULL NEW SECTOR BATTLES BEFORE RECONTRACTING FIDEL.

Strat:  Start Ernie Island w/ Team 1.

I hired Team 2 as soon as I could (even before I finished Ernie Island) and they were still en route while I took Mfumu's Mine with Team 1.

I took Mfumu's Mine then Fleatown with Team 1.  I sent Team 2 straight to Port Cacao.  Then it was Team 1 focusing on Fleatown, Ghost, Larry, Pentagruel, Poachers + Dragnov & 7.62 AP Ammo + Flay (mule).  Team 2, Port Cacao Docks, Mine, Mr. Ditch, Red Rabies, Dump, Port Cacao (I forget the exact order).  Somewhere along the line I sent Larry to Rehab - wasn't ASAP, but fairly quickly.  I forget but I also detoured Team 2 at some point to get the PSG and grenades from Fort Brigand.

As soon as I could, as soon as Corazon calls, but BEFORE you go to refugee camp, AIM Gold opens up for free.

Hired Team 3

Ivan (more for EXP than anything else -- prob should have also hired RED now that I think about it), auto weapons

Magic, sniper, auto weapons (despite not having trait he's still good, obviously)

Scully (LDR) (sniper, grenades, anything really)

Shadow (melee sniper, obviously)

This doesn't need to be a full team for checks as this is just a firepower team.

When Corazon calls for World Flip, that's when Biff calls for rescue.  Larry should be sober by then, so I had him join Team 1 to go up to Biff and get the Green Diamond without Killing Biff.

At the same time I had Team 2 do the Diesel quest.

Team 3 finally arrived.  I had them defend Port Cacao for World Flip while I had Team 1 return from Biff (Flay mules the Green Diamond down to Port Cacao) to trigger World Flip.  Team 2 wrapped up Diesel.

I'm not sure if I needed to do this.  I wonder if it's better to trigger World Flip at the last second (e.g., by sacrificing Flay there), with teams already on Ernie, at Major and Fort Brigand.  Since you have Mr. Ditch, you don't need the evidence at World Flip.  This is probably the better way.

Anyway, I didn't do that, so after defending World Flip (Team 1 Refugee Camp+Pentagruel, Team 3 Port Cacao, Team 2 doing Diesel) I did the following:

Team 3:  Kill Colonel

Team 2 + Larry:  Major

Team 1:  Ernie

Given I had plenty of time (more than 10 days?  7 days?), I had Team 3 just do a quick and easy assassination via the secret entrance, then retreat.  Then I split Team 3, with half going to help Team 1 going to Ernie and half to help Team 2 at Major.

The strategy with Larry at the Major is one more EXP expert to man the Mortar for a smoke mortar to protect the president when the inevitable comes down.

That's it.  I kinda regret not getting Smiley -- wasn't a part of this run, but I think I could have done it -- or getting the Major (would have been a lot tougher, I think) or Pierre.  But I suppose that's the next run?

Toughest Battles:  Probably defending the Port Cacao Mine with a fresh Team 3 from 30 some army troopers with scraps for arms at the Mine.  But Mustard Gas & War Crimes always saves the day.

Strangest thing:  You never end up repairing Vicki's special tool -- it's a waste of your extremely valuable time better spent repairing weapons (I barely repaired armor and often had weapons at just 70%).  You just end up using lockpicks and it's a wasted inventory slot.",5,1769992451.0,JaggedAlliance3,0,1.0,False

Hey,

I know this is a long shot and I don’t really have expectations, but I’m curious to see what happens after posting here :)

I’m married (over 8 years) and have been ENM for about 4 years now. It’s definitely had its ups and downs, but overall it’s been a positive experience that’s helped me grow a lot. I’m mostly looking for a friendship with a woman in a similar situation—someone who gets the lifestyle, the nuance, and the importance of honesty. I really enjoy connecting with people who are thoughtful, open-minded, and genuine, and I’m curious about friendships that have a playful, flirty energy too 😏.

A bit about me: I’m very into science, love wandering through art exhibitions, enjoy hiking and bodyboarding, and I’m always down for a cute coffee date or cozy night with good conversation. I’m also really into tarot—so if you like exploring the intuitive side of things, that’s a bonus.

If any of this resonates with you, and you’re 30+ and in my area (and able to verify), feel free to send me a chat request. Would love to see if there’s a natural vibe ❤️",1,1769991980.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

Several women chime in explaining why asking women out is creepy. OP keeps asking them ""why?""","### Thread

This really began with this thread in AITA: ***[AITAH for asking a woman out for a date that I met at a restaurant?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p7wf5g/aitah_for_asking_a_woman_out_for_a_date_that_i)***. In it, the OP describes how he asked out a woman he'd been chatting with in a coffee place and she said no. He accepted that and went about his day. He then comments this to a (man) coworker of his about it and he called him ""creepy"" for asking her out and making her uncomfortable. *Creepily*, most people in that thread disagreed with the coworker and told OP he's NTA.

Then comes the /r/changemymind thread:

***[CMV: Society should push back against ""not being able to take being asked out as a question"" just as much as ""not being able to take no for an answer"".](https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1qs7kfy/cmv_society_should_push_back_against_not_being/?sort=controversial)***

>I think there needs to be a lot more pushback against people like the coworker. The man did everything right : asked her out at an appropriate place (a coffee shop), got to know her (so they weren't strangers), and politely backed off when she said she already had a boyfriend. Yet he was still labelled a creep. Right now, a lot of men are afraid to ask out anyone at all, due to fear of being labelled a creep or weirdo. This is not reasonable.
>
>I think people need to make a very clear statement about this: If a man asks out a woman in a place intended for socializing, gets to know her, and immediately stops pursuing her if she rejects him once, then it's not creepy, not sexual harassment, and the man does not deserve any negative labels such as ""creep"" or ""weirdo"". It doesn't matter how ugly, unattractive or socially awkward he is. He is not a creep. I think most of the people saying ""NTA"" agree with that statement.
>
>But I don't think it's enough to just say that. We need to further and call out the people labelling those men as creeps (such as the coworker in the other thread). If someone says things like ""I was a club/event and some weirdo asked me out, I just want to do the activity in peace, why can't men leave me alone"", I think we should tell them ""No, the weirdo here is you, not him. He asked you out and then dropped it as soon as you rejected him. He didn't do anything wrong. You're the weirdo for labelling him a weirdo when he did what he everything he was supposed to do correctly"". (of course, the caveat here is that the man must have actually done everything correctly. if he kept asking despite being rejected, then he actually is a creep and deserves to be called a creep).
>
>I think that it's necessary to call out people labelling completely normal, kind, good men who respect women as creeps. Otherwise the result is that men are afraid to approach women and choose not to (and that includes the cute guy that you are always hoping would ask you out some day). There is already a lot of men who just never ask out any woman because they're afraid of being labelled a creep or sexual harasser. And then single women who are looking for a boyfriend are wondering why nobody asks them out anymore.

### Drama

> I'll give you some female perspective and you'll see if it changes your view or not. As a woman, I am so fatigued from being asked out on the regular that even one-time asks require too much unpaid emotional labor on my behalf. They add pressure on me, force me to maneuver through awkward social dynamics, and overall, they just add more work to my pile I never asked for.
>
>I'll give you an example. I'm a mid 30s, attractive woman. Within the past 6 weeks alone, I've had to hand out 7 separate rejections, in this order:
>
>professional contact at work party (guy I have to see again)
>
>new contact at work party (guy I have to see again)
>
>random guy in coffee shop (stranger I don't have to see again. the only one ok here imho)
> 
>professional contact who i had already rejected 6 months prior but who decided to ask again just in case (guy I have to see again)
>
>long time friend whom i had already said no to 4 months prior but decided to ask again just in case (guy I have to see again)
>
>new, very powerful professional contact in a professional setting (guy I have to see again)
>
> man i met through a repeated hobby, who ""checks back in"" every few months to see if I changed my mind (guy I have to see again)
Out of these 7 guys in 6 weeks, 6 of them are guys I will encounter again because they are in the same professional/hobby circles. This means that with each rejection I have to put on this mask and play this actress role of being sweet, and soft, and graceful, and smile kindly, with some lie, like ""Oh I'm so flattered!"" even though I am NOT flattered, I am fucking exhausted and wish you didn't ask. Not even once.
>
>From the female perspective, this feels like an unending string of requests. Every few days is yet another guy that essentially says ""Hey! Im here! I exist! Im interested! Im nice! Pay attention to me! I require your time!"" and once again, I have to now handle this new guy, on top of everything else I already have to handle, because he thinks that he is entitled to ""try at least once"" simply because he saw me existing in his general vicinity.
>
>And because there's so many requests, even ""correct"", ""one-time"" requests, like the stranger in the coffee shop, add up. Because to that stranger is just one ask. But to the woman it could be rejection #3 of the week. Imagine having to do this over and over again. It's brutal.
>
>Do with that what you will, but this is why so many women can't even take ""being asked out as a question"" as you said. It's because they get asked that question nonstop simply for existing as a female and they are tired. 
>
>> Do not call it ""female perspective"". This is not ""female perspective"" this is just one person's (your) perspective. You don't speak for all women. Calling it a ""female"" perspective directly contradicts the perspective given by many other women in the original thread:
>
>> Now, as for the rest of your post, I have to deal with a ton of things in life that I find annoying : slow loading bars, red lights when driving, cold weather, etc. Rejecting people and saying ""sorry, I already have a boyfriend"" is quite low on the list of things that I find annoying. It happens to me too, but I don't ever think ""I am fucking exhausted and wish you didn't ask. Not even once."".
>
>>Are you allowed to find it annoying? Sure. Are you allowed to feel exhausted? Sure. But are the men who asked you out doing anything morally wrong? No. Are you allowed to call them creepy (like the coworker did) or sexual harassment for asking you out? No.
>
>>> How heated you got over someone saying ""the female perspective"" is...telling. It seems an awful lot like you're trying to curate society to suit you better and discounting someone who is not blindly on board with that by minimizing their voice.

>>>> Neither gender (men nor women) should have to rely on ""signs"" or ""signals"" which can be misinterpreted. People shouldn't have to basically learn another language to avoid being labelled a creep.

>>>> So why fucking comment?

Both arguments presented here are clouded in bias, and lack concrete data regarding actual risk. A survey study with responses from women indicating the number of times they have been asked out, and how many times those attempts have led to physical or emotional violence, would be a better lead on objective risk. Again, the rate does not need to be 100%. Even a 1% chance of violence is a significant enough percentage for women to channel risk management strategies. Source: I am a certified risk assessor.

Because the fact to me that it happens at all, from verbal abuse to rape and murder, is too often. I wasn’t intending to offer exact concrete data on my reasoning, just that it is a concern to be aware of and to assess risk accordingly.

> While in a perfect world you'd be right, the truth is that right now for every ""normal"" interaction of this kind a typical woman has where a man asks her out, she says no, and he's ok with it and acts normal about it, there are multiple interactions where women feel unsafe in such situations because the men do indeed act creepy about it and don't take rejections well. So while this particular guy did everything right and was labelled a creep by his coworker undeservedly, what the coworker said did have some truth in it - women are often asked out in random places in ways that make them uncomfortable. And that should be called out. It's too bad some normal people are caught in the backlash, but until women can feel safe rejecting such advances, men should be aware that they can inadvertently make a woman very uncomfortable even if they are chill and have the best intentions. The woman doesn't know whether he's ""one of the good ones"".

>>>>>>> The truly creepy are already not caring about being called creep. Healthy Dudes need to get out of the victim mentality and not care about women belly-aching over the horror of (gasp) being asked out on a date

>>>>>>>> It's not a binary. Not every ""creep"" is the archetypal guy that sees women only as objects, therefore sees nothing wrong with being creepy. There are many internal states that could lead to the external ""creepy"" behavior, as with any behavior. Considering this, criticism is going to affect some of the targets differently than others. The potential for change remains there as long as the accusation holds weight.

No, as most people are reasonable human beings with an okay level of emotional regulation.

>>> I wouldn’t say it makes you a creep, but I do think asking a woman you don’t know well out on a date purely on the grounds of her being a woman you find attractive (and nothing beyond that) is a bit tactless and womanizing

The average person doesn’t want to be put in that position while simply trying to run a basic errand like a grocery run. Does that mean asking somebody out for those reasons is inherently a wrongdoing? No, because you have to meet people somehow.

>
>> Go to those askmen subreddits (or talk to men in real life, or look at statistics) and note how the amount of men asking women out is decreasing quickly over time. They explained that it's because they're told that women don't want to be asked out, and are afraid of being labelled a creep, or getting #MeToo'd.

1qtfrmt,http://pawsofability.com,"Its Okay, If Today is a Low Energy Day","There are days when you wake up already tired.

Not the kind of tired that coffee fixes —  
but the kind that settles into your bones.

If today feels like one of those days, let this be your reminder:

**It’s okay if today is a low-energy day.**

You don’t have to push through it.  
We don’t have to pretend you’re fine.  
You don’t have to make today look productive to anyone else.

# Low Energy Doesn’t Mean Low Effort

When you’re a parent of a child with special needs, even “quiet” days take effort.

You are still:

* Watching closely
* Anticipating needs
* Regulating emotions
* Holding space
* Making decisions

So when your body feels heavy, or your mind feels slow, that doesn’t mean you’re not trying.

It means you’ve been trying for a long time.

Low energy is not laziness.  
It’s information.

And that information deserves respect.

# You are allowed to move more slowly today and prioritize self-care, so you can recharge without feeling guilty or needing to explain yourself.

Every day doesn’t need to be efficient.

Not every day needs a checklist.  
Not every day has to have visible progress.

Some days need:

* Fewer expectations
* More patience
* Simpler meals
* Earlier bedtimes
* Gentler conversations

And those days are just as valid as the busy ones.

You are allowed to adjust your pace without apologizing.

# Caring Still Counts, Even When It’s Quiet

There is a kind of caregiving that doesn’t look impressive from the outside.

It looks like:

* Sitting beside your child instead of fixing something
* Letting go of what can wait
* Choosing presence over productivity
* Protecting your own energy so you can keep going

This is not doing less.

This is doing what matters most.

# Rest is not a sign of weakness but a form of strength that helps you sustain your caregiving and emotional resilience.

So many parents feel guilty for slowing down.

But rest doesn’t mean you’re giving up. It’s a sign of strength and wisdom to respond to what your body and heart need.  
It means you’re responding wisely to what your body and heart need.

When you rest, even briefly, you are:

* Preserving patience
* Protecting your health
* Making tomorrow easier
* Modeling self-respect for your child

That matters more than crossing something off a list.

# If Today Is All You Can Manage

Let this be enough:

To show up.  
You cared.  
You stayed.

Even if nothing else happened today, that is nothing.

That is love in its quietest form.

# A Gentle Reminder to End With

You don’t have to prove anything today.

No strength.  
Not productivity.  
Not resilience.

You are allowed to have low-energy days.  
They do not cancel your worth, your effort, or your love.

Sometimes, moving gently is the most powerful thing you can do.

This is the prologue of my urban fantasy novel set in London, 1997.
I’m looking for feedback on atmosphere, tone and pacing.
Thank you for your time.

ARCANUM – THE AWAKENING
By D. R. Leone
PROLOGUE: THE RENT VEIL

London, 1997.
The metropolis does not merely breathe; it bleeds a thick, chronic grey.
This is not poetic metaphor, but a visceral truth perceived only by those whose eyes have learned to focus beyond the obvious. Beneath a perpetual drizzle that never cleanses, only thins the soot, the city drags itself forward like a wounded beast. Narrow streets become clogged veins of concrete and mute despair. Millions move in a state of functional sleepwalking, pulsing to a mechanical rhythm, while distorted reflections in rain-slicked shop windows reveal ghostly faces passing one another without seeing, without knowing, without feeling.
From the fogged interior of a forgotten café near Charing Cross, the chords of Good Riddance (Time of Your Life) by Green Day drift through the air like a cynical lament.
Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go.
The lyric echoes as an unsolicited prophecy: time as a tyrannical master, dragging its victims forward by the wrist.
Yet there are rare individuals who sense the pressure of that invisible hand before it tightens. Who hear the whisper before it becomes a scream. Who recognise the fractures in reality long before the fabric of existence is torn apart completely.
Vitor Solari was one of them.
He did not yet understand his nature. At twenty-four, his routine was an offering to mediocrity: serving caffeine at a Costa Coffee to executives who barely acknowledged his presence. But when night fell, Vitor surrendered himself to knowledge that burned — hermetic philosophy and Gnostic texts. He devoured these secrets like a starving man, unable to explain why his dreams were crowded with symbols he had never learned, yet somehow knew.
That day, fate chose to stop whispering at Watkins Books. Founded in 1893, the bookshop guarded bones older than most British institutions. As he stepped inside, the bell above the door rang with a warped vibration — wrong in a way he felt before he heard.
Then he saw them.
Two men.
The taller one had greying hair and silver-grey eyes that seemed to contain ancient storms. The other, younger, remained half-lost in shadow between the shelves.
“Hello, Vitor,” the grey-haired man said. His voice carried strange harmonics that made the hairs on the back of Vitor’s neck rise.
“Do I… know you?” Vitor asked, hesitating.
“Perhaps not. But we know you.”
The man extended a business card — thick paper, old-fashioned, warm to the touch. Vitor took it, confused. It was completely blank.
“If you need us, you’ll know where to find us,” the man said, already dissolving into the darkness between the bookcases.
The younger man stepped closer, near enough for Vitor to see his eyes clearly: liquid amber, deep and restless, holding truths capable of unmaking lesser minds. He leaned in and whispered,
“The truth is not found where one looks — but where one dares to perceive.”
When Vitor blinked, he was alone.
The card still lay in his palm, seeming to burn without heat. Somewhere beyond the shop walls, the mundane world continued its routine.
But its surface had cracked.
The veil had been torn.",1,1769991732.0,fantasywriters,0,0.67,False

Now hen 18 grams of coffee are in the basket and pre infusion is set to 4 seconds, pressure never reaches 9 bars. This makes sense--coffee is not a blind basket. 4 sec with coffee (porous) would not make a non permeable seal.

I met this friend years ago through some of my friends and since then we became friends as well. When I met her for the first time, I did not feel any attraction towards her or see her as a romantic partner and we would chat maybe couple times a year mostly when my group and her group would go out for some drinks. Last year, throughout such a drinks night with friends we discussed about several things and couple months later when we all met again, she told me that what I told her was really helpful and thanked me for the advice that I have given her.

During spring, she went on a business trip that lasted couple months in a different country and at some point I messaged her to ask how are things going there and she said that it's all good and if I am not sure where to take a vacation, the city where she was could be a good choice. I wasn't sure about a vacation, but said to myself that sure why not and went there for vacation without telling her. I showed unannounced to her office and she was shocked in the good way. After her work time, we would go for walks around the city so I could see as much as possible within the few days I was there. After I came back home, we started chatting more frequently. Couple months passed, she came back home and during an afternoon she asked me if I want to meet for a coffee, I asked where and she could not choose a place. Due to comfort reasons, I told her ""why not your place?"" and she said ok, then we ended up chatting for 9 hours and I never felt bored for one second.

Few weeks after that, I cooked some pasta and while cooking I remembered that this is her favorite meal. After I was done, I thought about surprising her so I went unannounced to her place with some of the pasta. Before getting to her place, I thought that I will give her the pasta, chat for couple minutes and get back home, but somehow we ended up chatting until midnight.

Now the thing is that I am not sure about my feelings because I like being around her, I like discussing with her without getting bored, I like how I can make her laugh, I like her personality a lot, I like how I am more calm around her, I like how she feels safe around me and can speak freely about what is on her mind, she is very good looking, but I do not feel that spark, that powerful pull towards her as I felt in my previous relationships. None of my exes were my friends beforehand and probably that is why the question is even harder to answer. I do not want to engage a relationship if I am not sure of my feelings as it could hurt her very much, if the relationship will come to an end very soon, knowing that she cares about our friendship, while I also feel that she has feelings for me, but she never confessed or approached me in any clear way.",1,1769991433.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

Huh. I didn’t think you would be able to find this place. Granted, you driving out here in the spooky woods is, funny. Come on in.

Can it with the invitation jokes. It’s common courtesy. Not a spell or curse or whatever other words that mean the same thing.

\[footsteps in, door closing\]

 Oh, why thank you. I honestly got lucky with this place. It got cheap after they arrested the guy who used to live here. It was basically free, compared to the other places I was looking at. I *reallyyy* need to change the floorboards though... Sometimes I think there’s someone in the basement, but nope. Just old blood. A lot of it.

You can’t smell it? …Good for you. Ah, I’m messing with you. Maybe. But come in, mind your shoes, please don’t use the carpet as a welcome mat. Here, I’ll get your jacket.

\[jacket rustling with metal cans inside\]

Woah, why is it so heavy? Wait, let me guess. Beer? No? Soda?

\[taking out can\]

 …You brought canned coffee? If you drink another one of these, I swear your *veins* will be jittering at this point. It’s got nice pockets though. Your jacket, not your veins, that would be bad. Air embolism would lead to tissue damage, and- eh. The usual. 

What, do you want me to list everything that can go wrong like a medical commercial? Or do you just want to hear me talk more? 

Don’t tell me to shut up, you were the one who asked what would happen. I didn’t learn about stomach acid for nothing.

Wait, don’t drink it yet. \[snatches drink\] You always get more antsy after having one of these, and that’s the last thing you need before training.

Yeah you do. That one customer with the fish button up?- Yes, the trout- I know it’s not a salmon! That’s not the point! After you chugged that, you kept messing up trying to put the add ons for the order. Like your fingertips didn’t know how to press a screen. 

“Back in my day-” well

 (unironically) back in my day, I knew how to write a decent note, and I have nice handwriting. I even had to remake that drink- *unpaid*, mind you. 

Oh don’t worry. I am paying you! With your existence! Isn’t that worth something?

You’re never any fun. 

\[places can on table\] 

Stop distracting me then. Hold on, I need to get the stuff.

\[footsteps leaving, footsteps walking back, dropping items on table\]

Okay, down to business.

Classic weapons. Knives, stakes, crossbows, although they’re harder to conceal, and a little more old fashioned. Got these from a few poor hunters on their first day. Don't give me that look, they were the easiest hunt for me in a while. There have been more devices popping up lately, someone must be making a fortune off of making them. Now, they’re moreso for humans wanting to buy time and flee instead of trying to provoke us. Which is why I don’t have any on me for you to examine, most of them are one time use.  Fight or flight, two options.

…You thought- you thought I was going to teach you how to use these?  

\[genuine cackles of laughter\]

NO?!

\[more laughter\]

You think you have the slightest chance of killing me? Oooooh, what are you gonna do, chuck that can at me? You can’t even take out the compost bin without struggling! Trust me, this is better than nothing. Did you forget *I’m* the one teaching you all of this? Everything has a price. This is nothing compared to what I know.

Mainly biological stuff. I’ll admit, some of the stuff I know may be… outdated, to say the least. That, and some of my own theories were proven wrong over time. Good thing libraries still exist, and the internet, sometimes. 

Scientific papers, magazines, random Quizlets. Whatever’s available. You need to know what you’re up against if you want to be a step ahead. I actually worked in hospitals before and after I was turned. Not now though, I got too many migraines and cravings that I had to call off of work. 

Don’t call me Carlisle. That joke’s already ran its course. 

It’s honestly helped me out a lot though. It’s like a butcher knowing which parts of the meat to keep and throw away. Even which ones work best with which marinades, how long to really savor which part… 

Crap, I’m getting hungry again.

I told you to stop drinking that.

\[snatches can again\]

If scientists did experiments on you, it would be for your circadian rhythm. This feels like one already. 

You’re really going to get pissed at me for telling you to stop drinking coffee? 

What else could be then?

(huff) Look, we’ll be done with this soon. I hate to do this, but it’s necessary.

\[pouring drink down the drain\]

Red, relax. You just need- 

\[picking up weighted weapon\]

…you should really point that away from me.

If you’re really examining the crossbow, you should still not point the arrow at my chest. I was thinking about unloading it, but I wanted you to see what goes with it. 

(scoff, then a laugh)

Do you really think this would be over if you shoot that? You’d only be adding to the list of corpses this house has. 

So that’s how you want to play it? 

\[placing can down on counter\]

Alright. Do it. Count me at your mercy. 

\[arrow flying, a loud thud… to the chest\]

(groaning) Ah, ow… I didn’t think you had it in you. 

(laughter in pain before chuckling)

You’re shaking… awww, don’t worry. 

\[slow footsteps\]

I’ll be alright, Red.

\[yanks arrow out of chest\]

Here you go- oh, you don’t want it? Alright then. Stop staring at me like that. You didn’t listen when I said that weapon was outdated. I can’t die with strikes to the heart- at least where it should be in a human body. They’re only there to pump blood through your system, but vampires don’t need that kind of circulation to live. Sure, we physically still have hearts, but they’re useless. 

You can still try again… I have all night. 

\[drops arrow\]

Giving up? You only used it once. You would need a goat’s foot lever to reload it, but I’m strong enough to do that as many times as you want.

You still pierced my heart even in your sleepy state. Maybe with a bit more training, you’ll literally be a sleeper agent.

Stop trying to lie to me, the pink under your eyes means you haven’t slept in a while. You think I didn’t notice that you set several alarms to wake you two hours before your shift? There were eight of them. EIGHT. 

Look, I get it. Trying to work for anything really is already something people don’t want to do. You think I want to do all of this work trying to find someone? No. And- don’t say it, I know. The whole “it’s easier for you now than it was back then” speech. It’s true though- I’m glad it is. But you’re *expendable*, Red. They can easily replace you with any other desperate person. The undead have problems too. But you’re not meant to live like one.

\[audio starts to fade in and out\]

Don’t fight yourself. Just let yourself relax.

Hey, I’m just trying to find my friend that you agreed to help out with. 

So that’s why you tried to kill me? Because of a choice *you* made? YOU chose to help me. And I LET you help me. I talk about my friend a lot to you because they’re the only reason you’re not dead, and I know damn well you’d do the same if your friend went missing, if you even had any.

Hey. Look, you’re just tired, okay? Here, lay down. I said-

\[door opening\]

Don’t walk out on me right now. Fire at me again if it’ll help out- Red!

\[door closing, door opening behind, leaves crunching beneath shoes. There’s a pause as Red realizes what happened overnight- their car was broken into.\]

Red, I- oh… shit. Who would do this? Is there anything missing?

\[They examine the car, probably slamming the car door and trunk\]

Okay, that’s one positive at least. They didn’t even try to hide that they busted in. Either they had to run or left it so you knew someone else was out here-

…Don’t tell me you think I, for whatever batshit reason, did this. You can’t seriously think I would do this to your car.

Trap you? You can go walk off into the woods for all I know! When would I even have the time to break-

I just wanted you to be awake and functioning for once! Was that so wrong? I-... okay. Sure. You always figure something out, so do whatever you want. I’m not going to stop you from anything. See where being stubborn gets you.

So here’s how it started: I posted somewhere that I’m looking for a part-time weekend job. Then, a young, good-looking CEO of a well-known sportswear brand messaged me asking if I’m interested in being his personal assistant (PA). He said he needs a helping hand and asked if I could start right away.

He offered to pay me ₱1,000 per hour just to:

* get food and eat with him
* make him coffee
* keep him company because he sometimes works from home and feels lonely

The catch? We’d be alone in his condo unit in Makati.

I doubted my safety since it would literally be just the two of us inside his place, so I declined.

But then, I regretted it and messaged him again to apologize and say I’d accept the offer after all—only to never get a reply. HAHAHA.

Now, after checking him out online, he seems decent, family-oriented, and honestly very attractive. And now I’m feeling a bit of *sayang*.

I know safety should come first, but part of me wonders if I was just being overly cautious or if I missed out on a unique opportunity.

Chatted off and on for a few weeks until one Saturday evening when we both found ourselves home alone. We decided to have some wine and watch a movie. 

We had openly discussed a casual relationship, involving the things adults do together.

That thing happened that evening- totally consensual. But when it was over, that man RAN for the door. I didn’t know what to say or do. I texted him after he’d left and asked if he was okay and all I got back was “when I feel uncomfortable I run. Thanks for tonight.”

I haven’t heard from him since and don’t plan on reaching out even though part of me desperately wants to tell him what he did was so ugly. ",38,1769991188.0,datingoverforty,69,0.93,False
1qtfgve,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1qtfgve/youre_all_invited_to_my_pity_party/,You're all invited to my pity party :|,"I'm having a bit of a day-- and I admit, it's stupid.  But now I'm beating myself up like I do whenever I feel a little too dumb for comfort.  

I started crushing on this guy.  But I was talking myself down from my crush saying, ""Well, if he liked me I'm sure he'd have reached out by now, if anything he might be interested in a friendship."" and I took the time to let that soak in and I realized-- yes, I would like to have a friendship even if it doesn't progress to more.  So, even though he accepted the offer to grab  coffee he mentioned he just started dating someone.  And overall, I feel glad to be getting out there and socializing.  It is a relief not to have the added pressure of wondering if the coffee outing would mean anything, and knowing that he's taken quite literally makes it impossible for my brain to consider him as anything more than just a friend, I respect that boundary fully.    But there is still a sting.

  
Deep down inside, there is a part of me that is struggling with some real self-doubt.  Whenever I've asked a couple of guy friends about dating advice, they always cheer me on to make the first move because, in their words, I'm an attractive and likable woman who could land a date.  But I've stepped out twice now to work towards that and even though the first guy (a friend a few years ago) said he returned my feelings, he ended up dating someone else.  The 2nd guy, I technically only asked him to coffee but I think the signs were a bit obvious and now he has a girlfriend as well.  

Before I left my ex 4 years ago, he used to tell me that I was lucky that he was still attracted to me after I gave birth to our child... And so now here I am, soaking in all of the rejections I've experienced and wondering if there is something wrong with me that I just can't see.  It makes me wonder if it's how I look or maybe if I'm too shy or too loud... Or the fact I have a child.  I don't know.   Part of me was hoping grandpa was sending someone to me, considering grandpa used to go to the morning service with my grandma and I started going with her after grandpa passed away... and that's how I met this new friend.  I had tried so hard to stay away from that church, so I almost thought that maybe I was supposed to be there for a reason.  My granny doesn't even sit with me anymore though, she has her friend... I was making friends at the other church I was attending and now I'm back to sitting alone. It's frustrating.  I love my friendships and I do my best to take care of the people who are in my circle, but I still wish for something more.  And I hate that I'm on the look-out for something more when obviously nobody is looking for me out here.  

It's fine.  I'll be fine.  Just having a pity-party.  I'm sure I'll change up my mindset & plan to get to know more people so I can stop feeling so damn sorry for myself. ",4,1769991061.0,Rants,5,0.83,False

I worked there for a short time and ended up quitting because of retailiation I recieved after I called them out on stealing tips from myself and the other baristas. I will post a YouTube link to where I uploaded some audio from the meeting SunBean had discussing tips where they admit Fred as an owner is participating in the tip pool. Myself and the other baristas shared our hours and tip information for a pay period and discovered for that particular pay period Fred had taken 42%+ of the tips. They did end up paying us back after I reported them to the MN Dept. of Labor.

This is why I'm not surprised to see them trying to monetize off what is going on in Minneapolis. It disgust me that they posted ""Support Your Immigrant Neighbors Businesses: BUY BREAKFAST BURRITOS"" and didn’t give the restaurant, Burrito El Patron,  a shout out. Support small businesses that are ethical, not SunBean Coffee.  Go buy a burrito directly from Burrito El Patron and grab a coffee from another cafe nearby...

1qtf90v,https://i.redd.it/0sl71kpi2zgg1.jpeg,Genuinely why does anyone eat at Dunkin? Just a worse Krispy Kreme 🤷‍♂️,"As a donut lover (and huge Krispy Kreme fan) I find it insane that where I live now in the northern US only has Dunkin’ Donuts as a “reliable” place to get donuts, and the occasional Tim Horton’s. Whenever I go to Dunkin I give a donut or a donut hole a chance and always come out underwhelmed. The coffee in my opinion is also mediocre. Whenever I scroll this subreddit everyone is talking about how bad the food is or how their orders are wrong, and they’re right. Not only are the donuts bad, but also the other food I’ve had is gross, too. Why would anyone spend their hard earned money to eat here or get a coffee? If the name of your establishment involves donuts, at least make said donuts edible. It’s a niche not many people can pull off, and if they’d actually invest in edible donuts I feel most customers would actually want to go. Any Dunkin lovers feel free to prove me wrong, but just wanted to talk about this and ask what the hype is, if any.",0,1769990507.0,DunkinDonuts,28,0.32,False

From the desk, Austin watched Styrofoam cups and brittle plastic bags scrape across the cracked asphalt until they collapsed into corners no one looked at anymore.

His Bible lay open in front of him. A half-sheet of paper waited beside it, his pen tapping uselessly at the margin.

“Purity? Forgiveness?” he muttered. “Would they even care?”

The smell of feet and ripe urine clung to the room. He stared at the verses like they belonged to someone else’s life.

A knock sounded at the edge of the office, followed by a familiar chipper voice.

“Mornin’ Austin! How ya doin’?”

“Best of mornings, Supreme Advisor Henry,” Austin said, giving a small hand twirl and a bow.

Henry Cater leaned against the frame. He was a supervisor—warm, steady, the kind of man people liked to be around. The kind Austin wanted to be.

“So—Owen and Pastor Greg are calling a meeting,” Henry said. “It’s about the snow that’s coming. Fifteen minutes. Conference room.”

He tapped the doorframe and glanced at Austin’s open Bible and notes. “Sorry to interrupt your devotion prep. I’m heading over early to make coffee—you want some?”

Austin considered whether he’d had too much already that morning.

He definitely had.

“Umm… sure; I’m dragging. Thanks, man.”

Henry gave a nod and a thumbs-up and turned to leave.

“If you interrupt me again,” Austin called after him, “you will be sorry!”

He kicked at the back of Henry’s legs. Henry danced away, laughing and shouting for help from the men in the day room like Austin had actually assaulted him.

Marcus Lane popped up like a jack-in-the-box. “You young men oughta know better. Ain’t no help for ya!” He laughed too loud, too long—eyes bright, already looking past them for whatever was next.

For a moment, the bleakness broke.

Then it returned, like it always did. The day room settled back into its usual murmur—men shifting in their chairs, hunting warmth.

Austin closed his Bible with a soft thud and stretched as exhaustion slid back onto his shoulders.

Steam seeped from the bathroom door.

Austin stared. For a second the room behind it wasn’t a bathroom at all—just tile and heat and the memory of emptiness. A place that should have been ordinary, but wasn’t. A graveyard pretending to be clean.

He felt the pull of it, the same quiet insistence that had started months ago. His feet didn’t move, but something in him leaned toward the seam.

A flash—blankets on concrete under a bridge, stiff shapes inside them, mouths rimmed with frost.

“Enough.”

He pushed away from the desk and threaded through the jagged halls. The building’s twists were already in his muscle memory. His body knew the way, even when his mind drifted.

The conference room door stood open. At his usual spot, a fresh cup of coffee waited for him. He sat, the chair creaking beneath him, and nodded to the others as he lifted the mug.

Owen Ikerson, the superintendent, greeted Austin warmly, but behind the smile was a stern man who noticed everything.

“Mornin’, Austin. How was last night?”

Austin held the mug a second too long before drinking, like he could warm his hands through it and let that be the answer.

“Not gonna lie… it was a little rough.”

He looked down into the coffee. Holding it felt like propping your feet up in front of a fireplace—a comfort you remembered more than lived.

Henry, Owen, and a few others watched him, waiting.

“While I was doing my rounds before dinner,” Austin said, “I found Will buying from Josh. I asked them to leave for the night. They were giving me a hard time because of the cold. I haven’t seen them this morning, and it’s been eating at me.” He swallowed. “The guests looked at me like I was a monster.”

Pastor Greg sat back and pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose.

He raised his eyebrows. “Will? Really?”

“I’d encourage you to think about this,” Greg said, careful in the way he always was when he was about to cut. “I’m not saying you did anything wrong. You enforced the rules. But is the offense worth somebody losing their life?”

He let that hang.

“There’s room for mercy too,” he added. “You did what was right, but was it best?”

Owen chimed in before Austin could. “We’ve all been there, Austin. You’re going to make calls that don’t sit right with you. But we all learn from these situations.”

He combed his mustache with his fingers and glanced at Greg like he was checking his footing. Greg nodded once, silent affirmation.

Austin’s jaw tightened. He wanted to argue—the rules were there for a reason. But Austin’s response got caught in his throat.

Mercy over wrath. That was Greg’s model.

The quiet broke.

“Anyways,” Owen said, “I’ll try to be quick today. We’ve got a lot of prep ahead of us.”

He flipped a page on his clipboard. “I don’t know if you saw the news this morning, but the storm’s going to be a lot worse than we expected. They’re calling for over thirty inches the first night and more over the next couple days. The plows won’t keep up. The city already put out a warning—get your supplies before tomorrow night. They expect travel to shut down completely.”

Owen’s eyes moved around the table, landing where they needed to.

“Obviously we’ll be going into lockdown,” he said. “We need someone here with the guests. Austin…” He glanced at Greg, as if remembering a few months ago. “I wish I could say I’d do it, but with the boys at home I can’t be here three days straight. You’re on most evenings and you know the men pretty well. Would you stay with the guys?”

Austin looked up.

Once the doors closed, whoever was inside would be under his watch until the roads cleared.

If he took the shift and got them through in one piece—no one pushed back out, no one unaccounted for—then he’d have proof he wasn’t unfit for this. He would handle hard nights, not just devotions and small talk.

No one freezing under a bridge because of him.

Not this time.

An ark in the middle of the city—and he’d agreed to be sealed inside with them.

The questions came rushing out. “Okay—where am I sleeping? What are we feeding everybody? And if something happens, who am I calling?”

Greg didn’t even blink. “My office has plenty of room for an air mattress plus camera access, you can sleep there.”  He answered like he was reading it off in his head. “Food’s already here—we kept it simple. There’s a sheet in the kitchen that tells you what to do.”

He pointed with the pen. “You call me if things go haywire. If you can’t get me, call Owen.”

Austin kept nodding.

Owen exhaled and rubbed his forehead. “And one more thing—because of this storm, we’re shutting the doors early. Once we do, nobody’s running in and out.”

He met Austin’s eyes. “So I need you here by six. Not because I’m trying to be strict—because if you get stuck out there, we’re not opening up again.”

“Six,” Austin repeated; the word felt like a promise.

Greg nodded once, satisfied. “Go home today. Get some rest. Maybe stop by the store if you want snacks.”

The meeting shifted back into logistics—keys, protocols, backup supplies. Pens tapped. Pages flipped. Someone’s chair squeaked. The sound came in small, safe pieces.

He took another sip of coffee and the bitter taste carried him somewhere else: a classroom, the clack of markers placed back onto the tray, calculator racks lined up in their slots. Everything in its place. Orderly. 

When he opened his eyes, the room was empty.

He hadn’t heard anyone stand. He hadn’t heard the door. There should have been footsteps in the hallway, voices fading.

There was just…nothing.

A faint ring clung to the fluorescent lights overhead. The walls—once a dull beige—looked paler, as if the color had been sapped while he blinked.

The hum of the fridge in the break room carried too clearly, like the building itself was the only thing still awake.

In his peripheral, the table seemed to stretch. The chairs doubled, wavering. Austin had the strange sense that if he didn’t move, he might disappear into the buzz—just another chair tucked under the table, unseen, unneeded.

For a heartbeat, it almost felt peaceful.

His chair scraped loudly as he stood, the sound too sharp in the empty room. Around the table, other mugs were still hot, releasing thin threads of steam, as if they were fresh.

They’d all been here a second ago.

He pressed his palms flat on the wood, grounding himself. He moved toward the door on careful steps, as if not to disturb whatever had already stolen the room.

At the far window, condensation blurred the glass—but behind it, something shifted. Slow. Crooked. 

Austin blinked hard.

The table was ordinary again. The hum softened. The window was only fog.

He swallowed; his throat was dry. It was probably just someone outside, looking for the entrance.

The steam rising from the coffee cups stalled—threads hanging in midair—then started again.

Austin’s fingers tightened on the mug without him meaning to. He set it down like it was suddenly too hot.

He forced himself to the door.

The hallway was empty. Owen’s office sat dark. A note rested on the desk like someone had placed it there neatly, waiting to be found.

Austin,

Had to step into the kitchen.

I know this work gets heavy. I’m grateful you’re here with us. Don’t carry it like you’re alone—storm or no storm, the Lord doesn’t lose track of the people who come through these doors.

Get rest today. Greg will finish the rundown.

Proud of you. Keep your eyes open.

—Owen

Owen’s handwriting was steady and confident—the hand of a man who believed what he said.

Austin wanted that. Wanted to be solid enough that someone else could lean without feeling the cracks.

Oh right—the guest.

He grabbed the greasy handle, pulled open the heavy glass door, and stepped into the gray parking lot. A single blue Ford Ranger rattled past. The street looked desolate, like the storm had already started.

A figure moved along the dirty brick wall, away from the entrance, limping.

Austin crossed the lot, boots crunching lightly on grit and old asphalt.

“Excuse me,” he called. “Are you looking for the entrance?”

The figure stopped and turned.

A woman stood there wearing a tattered sports jacket that hung loose over a musky blanket draped across her head, wet leaves clinging to it. Her hands were wrapped in mismatched socks, clutching the fabric tight. Middle-aged. Glasses crooked and held together with tape. Her mouth hung open, showing teeth gone black at the edges. Scabs crusted her face in frozen blotches, oozing where the cold had cracked them.

“N-No,” she said quickly. “No, I can’t go inside. They’re waiting for me.” Her eyes flicked past him like he was a post in the ground. “I just need my… my cigarette. It was right here. They’ll be angry if I don’t find it. Have you seen it?”

“No, ma’am,” Austin said, keeping his voice gentle. “I haven’t. But you look cold. We can get you coffee inside—are you okay?”

Her eyes darted again, restless. “Umm… yeah, I’m good. I gotta h-head back. My aunt from Montana’s coming into town.” She made a small motion like a wave that didn’t quite reach her fingers. “Have a n-nice day.”

She limped away, shrinking against the wind until the city swallowed her.

Austin stood where he was. The image of her burned into his mind. He realized he hadn’t even asked her name.

Owen’s line floated up, uninvited: the Lord doesn’t lose track of the people who come through these doors.

She hadn’t even walked through them.

In a storm like the one coming, how was he supposed to keep people like her alive?

Austin looked up. A green neon sign buzzed overhead:

CENTRAL CITY RESCUE MISSION

Its glow washed over the cross beside it on the brick wall.

He turned toward the building’s large windows. The only signs of life inside were shadows moving behind the frosted panes—men wrapped in blankets, clutching cups, weaving between cots and corners, disappearing into an amalgamation of dingy drywall and worn tile.

His gaze dropped back to the parking lot. Without realizing it, he drifted a few steps away from the wall.

He imagined what it would be like to walk past the forgotten corners of the lot, past the brittle bags lodged in thorn bushes and the dirty Styrofoam cups, past Pastor Greg. Past the woman with the limp. Past the snow. Past the rules. Past it all.

The Ford Ranger tore past on the road again—engine barking, tires hissing on wet pavement. The sound hit the mission’s windows hard enough to make the glass shiver.

Austin jerked back. His heel caught the curb. For half a second he windmilled, stupidly, waking up mid-fall.

The truck vanished around the corner.

He hadn’t realized how close he’d gotten to the street. 

If he stepped off the curb, would anyone stop him?

Would anyone notice if he disappeared too?",1,1769990323.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1qtf5rc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qtf5rc,[Hamilton Khaki Field] - A review.,"The watch showed up in a cardboard box with all the ceremony of a replacement part, which honestly feels right for a watch like this. No boutique lighting, no congratulations, just a practical object landing on the porch. First reaction was honestly a bit underwhelming. It’s simple to the point of almost being dull. Three hands, no shine, no complication, just this muted gunmetal brown case that looks less styled than worn in, like something a field medic might pull off a fallen spy who turned out to be an accountant with a government expense account. It doesn’t try to impress. It just looks like something meant to get used.

After a couple days, the details start to win you over. The dial has this gritty texture you don’t notice until the light hits it right, and the numerals are easy to read when you’re half awake in the morning. The real charm, though, is the H-50 movement inside. Hand-wound, based on ETA roots, and stretched out to an 80-hour power reserve, which means you can ignore it for a couple of days and it’ll still be ticking. Winding it becomes part of the routine. The crown action is solid, the resistance builds nicely, and there’s something satisfying about manually starting the day’s timekeeping instead of letting an automatic rotor or battery do the work. It’s simple, but it feels mechanically honest.

The real appeal, though, is that it disappears. In a hobby where everything seems to compete for wrist presence, this thing quietly gets out of the way while life does its usual chaotic thing. Errands, spilled coffee, chasing my kid around the house, bumping into doorframes, the normal collisions of everyday life. The watch just takes it and keeps going. After a while it stops feeling like a new purchase and just becomes part of the routine. Just a solid little machine keeping track while everything else carries on. And honestly, that’s probably why it’ll stick around in my collection.

I think I've gotten the hang of the process and have pull a wide variety of good shots and horrible shots. I'm looking for a an upgrade mainly because I feel that the variations between shot to shot seem big enough where its hard to tell what change is coming from what. 

I currently pull 1 shot a day and only drink with milk. Other than the 2 machines, I spray the beans, WDT and tamp. 

  
My goal is to get more consistent shots. As for flavor, I think I'm in the chocolatey-camp. I've realized I am not a fan of acidic coffee and tea-like coffees I feel cut through milk in a way I'm not a fan of. I've heard that conical burrs help bring out this flavor but that doesn't mean that flat burrs cannot (LH videos). I'd be mostly grinding medium to medium dark beans. I've also been becoming a fan of decaf as I can drink this at night so would grind pretty fine for these but I don't expect to be grinding super light roasted coffees.

The problem I'm facing is that if I make a latte on Monday and do the same process with the same beans on Tuesday, it tastes fairly different. I keep the beans in an airtight black stainless steel container. 

  
So what would be the best options for upgrading? I don't think I'll be some expert prosumer and I don't steam my milk so I wouldn't need a dual boiler. If I want to stay below the 1k mark for the entire upgrade, how can I best allocate this?

  
Would it be better to first try some mods like change out the burrs for the df54 (if 54 burrs exist)? Is this inconsistency expected for this setup and would upgrading to something like a niche or timemore really help? Thanks. ",1,1769990162.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

My esophagus was looking good, they didn’t take any biopsy from my esophagus, but the doctor would see signs of barret’s right? My LES working properly. No dysplasia/metaplasia in stomach, just a little red with tiny bit of bile which my GI doc said not to worry about. And an ulcer. Took some PPI, ate lite for 2 months. That’s it.

Now 2 years later I’ve been having LPR symptoms for like 3 months now. (Severe cough, lump in throat). ENT said it’s acid reflux. Gave me PPI and it helped 90%. I only have a little bit of cough here and there.

I am worried tho. I’m gonna go for endoscopy this month to figure out the root cause for my LPR and see how I can fix it. Ever since the disgnosis I have cut out chocolate, coffee, fast food etc. I lost like 11 pounds in the last 2 months which also got me worried but I have been eating like 1000 kcal a day bc of this so that’s probably why.

Can BE or cancer develop in 2 years? ChatGPT says no and it takes years for it to develop.

Isn’t LPR more damaging than GERD tho? It only takes a little to irritate throat right?

1qteyfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Friendzone/comments/1qteyfm/is_this_fearfulavoidant_attachment_or_friend/,Is this fearful-avoidant attachment or friend zoning?,"I met a woman at work about 1.5 years ago since we were in the same org. She worked in the office, but I was virtual. We had bi-weekly 1:1s that originally had a purpose but that we kept going well beyond their purpose. I thought she was pretty, and we had good rapport, but I didn’t think anything of it. About six months ago, when I transferred orgs, she causally mentioned she wouldn’t mind if we kept the 1:1 series. So, we did. I moved close to the office in October so she started asking if I’d be going into the office. There are actually two offices. In November, I mentioned I’d be going to Office B for a work thing, and the day of, she messaged me saying she’d happen to be there too but forgot to mention it. We had lunch. We intentionally met in Office A the following week to have lunch, and she suggested we invite some third parties. At this point, I was still getting friend vibes but I thought there might be more. She seemed to be tracking my future office visits, asking when I’d be in, etc. She always lingered. Our virtual 1:1s started going to over an hour, mutually sustained.

We had a third lunch in November and I just really got the sense she was into me despite it also being friendly in theory. So in early December, I used a work event to see if she wanted to meet. We ended up spending 6 hours that day together, most of it unnecessary. We skipped a leadership meeting (yeah, I know), had lunch, which she extended to coffee. She extended every moment. At the end of the day, we stayed until 6pm and she used the excuse that we might as well stay another hour since we already paid for parking for the next hour. At this point, I thought I knew he was into me. The vibe and excuse felt so obvious.

The next week, I invited her to lunch while she was PTO and she agreed to meet me anywhere. As always, the time together went on for a while (2.5 hours). She probed indirectly about my relationship status. After, I asked her out again but made my intent clear, saying that I saw it as personal time. She recognized what I meant and said she had a complex situationship but was otherwise happy to meet me and apologized if she misread things. I told her she didn’t misread. (She never mentioned this situationship before and still has never mentioned it again.) Anyway, we met and had a drink. She drove me home. I told her I had a good time. She suggested we do it again. The next day, we scheduled a new “date.” A couple days beforehand, she asked to move it back a day, and I said she could text if that’s easier.

She immediately accepted my offer to text … but it felt like she went cold mid-convo after just a few exchanges. She closed down the conversation fast—stopped giving me any hooks. OK, so I texted her the morning of the “date” and she said she had to cancel, giving a story about being sick and cancelling on others. I said we could rain check when she’s better. I sent a message on Jan 1 wishing happy new year. She responded warmly, but it felt flat. So I disengaged until she Slack’d me 8 days later about some work thing. That escalated into a ton of talking and playfulness, to the point that she tried setting up a verbal meeting. We met in person but still work adjacent. We talked for almost 3 hours and shared dessert with two forks. She mentioned she’d be going to her home country for a month that week. The goodbye felt awkward and she mentioned we could keep in touch over Slack.

Well, that night, I then texted her asking about that rain check before she left. She accepted it and fit me in, and we met again for a couple hours the day before she left. After this rain-check text, it seemed like everything exploded. We’d go on to talk every single day even while she was half the world away. She opened up about stuff that ... were quite personal. Before she left, we met in person and it was good, but I could tell she didn’t want any physical advances. We’d have 1,000+ messages per day.  She told me she was fearful-avoidant. She mentioned an ex who screwed her, gaslighting, etc., how she had years of depression. She initiated most days, sometimes with the most random shit. She vented to me a lot. She also engaged with me when I shared topics. It felt mutual and even. 

She would engage with my flirting but never let it get too explicit and would diffuse it when it was getting too intense. She called me “bb” once. It almost felt like we had entered into a relationship … but every single thing was plausibly deniable. I picked up on a shift after a couple weeks where I thought she was engaging less. The responses became more spread out, then there were less of them, then less initiation, then no initiation, then convo killers, and then 3 days of silence. Then, she messaged me about some work thing and we picked up a normal (but less voluminous) cadence. Now things feel very coupely again. She comes back in a couple weeks, and I’ll see how things progress then.

But, here’s the thing. This simultaneously feels super obvious she’s into me and also like she only sees me as a friend. She’s obviously FA. She admitted it… but is this what it’s like to try to court an FA woman? Or am I delusional and she sees me as a friend?",1,1769989774.0,Friendzone,1,1.0,False
1qteyem,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1qteyem/i_35m_diagnosed_adhd_was_broken_up_with_during/,I (35M diagnosed ADHD) was broken up with during partners (30NB diagnosed ASD) burnout. Looking for understanding & steps for reconciliation without making it more difficult for them.,"Hello r/autism.

I am looking to find some understanding as I am struggling with a recent breakup and I do not have anybody in my life to discuss this that can help me with understanding and the next steps if any (except for my therapist but my appointment is in 6 days and I am looking for help to make it until then; will get into that in the body of the text).

I am going to leave out descriptive aspects of certain things for maximum anonymity because my partner deserves that so apologies in advance for certain specifics that may seem slighty unclear.

I (35M) was diagnosed with ADHD in November 2024, so I have been fairly recent on my neurodivergent journey and have been extremely hyper-focused on it for the past year. I have been trying to put myself out in the dating pool very often and have found myself drawn to other neurodivergent people. I started dating this partner (30NB) in October last year. Things started very intense in a great way. I am extremely drawn to intellect as well as a care for community, the people around you as well as creating & enjoying your own cozy space, creative hobbies and parallel play as well. We matched on SO MANY interests and I know we both had very strong feelings very early. I loved the way they communicated and I felt very seen as our communication was great. I considered myself a very secure attachment style. They communicated with me that I made their nervous system feel safe and we often had intimate moments where they wanted to remove boundaries they had previously placed on relationships and have me around during times when they would often shut down and hermit because my presence calmed them. This was such a fulfilling feeling and I have never felt love like this. I felt like I had a very good understanding of them. I felt extremely fufilled and I immediately saw a future with this person. I was very excited and very happy every time we could share any time together. I valued every moment.

The way they showed love by small gifts, crafting me things that made them think of me makes me absolutely cry thinking about it. They would send me a good morning message every morning with a song link that reminded them of me. They would also spill paragraphs to me about their hobbies and things they loved; I was head over heels for the way this person (and still am) existed in the world. They received love by acts of service and that is how I showed love, I put the most effort into any relationship I ever had. I would make them small gift baskets of their favourite things, cook them breakfast in bed, open every door for them, ground them when they were anxious, drive and get them small things they needed or if they were hungry I would send them food when they were overwhelmed or low energy to get out of bed. I left them small very thoughtful gifts at their door of their house (with communication & consent, no surprises), they were so appreciative and things were amazing. This lasted for about the first month. They also shared with me an app that could track their cycle and would teach me how they would feel during each part of their cycle as they suffered from PMDD and endometriosis and the stage of their cycle would have big impacts. I took this to heart and spend lots of time researching and understanding.

Following the first month a lot of understandable stressors came into their life, financial, life, legal, relational. Very understandable. I felt them get quieter in late November. After about a week of them reaching out less and cancelling plans twice in a row I checked in and asked if things were okay as it felt like what a NT person would do if being avoidant in my previous experiences and I felt slightly anxious. My brain was swirling with thoughts that I was being too much, trying too hard or there was things they weren't telling me. They replied with a straightforward text message saying that ""everything is fine and they would tell me directly otherwise, and they don't particularity like anxiousness in relationships and that anxiousness would make them push away in other circumstances but they really liked me and that is not the case in this situation and they just need trust and space because they are feeling burnt out and they will be unable to give me constant reassurance"". I took it to heart and because the message had some reassurance in it and I did believe them and I always appreciated their straightforwardness and I trusted them entirely I was able to regulate and give them the space they needed at the time. I was noticeably anxious and placating around them the next time I saw them as it was around 2-3 weeks before I saw them again and I felt a lot of pressure to not be too much. They made small genuine but caring comments about it and I was able to self correct immediately.

A few goes by and it is around Christmas time and they made a comment of how impressed they were at my self regulation and how I immediately fixed and self corrected my anxiety and they were very impressed and thanked me for my effort and they see me. They were putting in immense effort around this time with social responsibilities, parenting, a legal issue as well as the financial stress of Christmas and they we're fighting hard thru the burnout to be there for everybody in their life. I had an amazing Christmas season with them and their friends. I felt solidly a part of their friend group and their life and I was very happy even though some of my needs like words of affirmation & some intimacy was lacking but I was okay with putting those on hold because I understood from their communication to me that they we're going thru a lot. They are an amazingly articulate person and the connection we had was beyond worth putting some needs on hold for the time being. Then post Christmas the immense burnout hit as other major stressors came up in their life around Dec 30th mixed with them already using up all their energy PLUS way way more during the Christmas season. They seriously needed a recharge. They had an incident where they lost the key to a car they were selling and it was causing them massive financial harm post Christmas. They went full no contact. I reached out to them once or twice during the no contact and they told me directly that they are so burnt out that they cannot even message me it is too much. I told them to take all the time they need and I will be there when they were ready. They appreciated it a lot and I gave them space.

During that time (about 7-10 days) I struggled with thinking of them lots and the lack of words of affirmation or how they felt about me started to spiral. The logic center of my brain could understand how much they cared about me and how they put in effort thru the burnout but the emotional side longed for the love I received previous and would lie to me and tell me I wasn't enough or doing enough or that I screwed up. It was difficult to self regulate. They finally reached out to me and I was very excited to see them even in short bursts. I saw them twice and I made sure I was very low key and kept it easy with them as I spent the entire 10 days researching burnout and what they needed from me. I did physical grounding exercises for 15mins before we would meet to be extra calm for them and to be the best me I could for them in that moment. They appreciated my confidence and calmness. I asked them in person if I could talk to them about our communication during burnout and they hesitantly agreed with a disclaimed that they don't have enormous capacity but if I truly needed it they would. We talked in a coffee shop we liked to frequent as part of our routine together and I just said that words of affirmation during this burnout time may be very important to me to keep me grounded and regulated because my emotional side of my brain will play tricks and I know they don't have a lot of capacity and I wasn't asking for immediately and I know that might be difficult but it will help me a lot in navigating our relationship. They told me they understood as putting them in my shoes helps them understand better; and they said that it would be very difficult them but they would try their best and it might come from places of logic rather than emotion and they know that I need it but they would try. I appreciated this a lot.

Things were going very well although I did not get to see them for about 2 weeks from this moment with also very little contact through the day as they recovered, but I saw the effort they would put it and it meant so much to me. I get very excited and sometimes might text too heavy and they would pull away for hours. Every time it happened it made me feel bad about myself, even though I understood why. When they had capacity my excitement was met with their excitement and it felt very nice. Now it felt extremely bad to be myself. I felt myself becoming robotic and having difficulty in how to communicate in way they needed without shrinking myself and my needs. This would cause a lot of rumination.

Fast forward to last week and they reached out to me for a 90minute visit in the middle of their busy day which meant the world to me. It felt like they were feeling so much better. We had to squeeze it in on a weekend small window. I know they needed to get groceries as they were unable to physically leave their house during the week from an injury. I also know that weekend grocery shopping is a nightmare for them. I offered to body double during that time together and help them grocery shop. They put their loops in and we would hold hands when they needed and it was packed in there but we got it all done. They also mentioned they hated Valentines Day but loved hearts and they saw Valentines Day pajamas they were very excited but it was only tops no bottoms and they just wanted some cozy bottoms (this is important for later). When we got in the car we kissed which was very nice and they said how appreciative of me they were and they couldn't have done it without me there. They were much more physical touch oriented than they had been in 2 months. I felt so happy that as I drove away after we met I was crying because I appreciated their effort so much and that meant the world to me. They also told me they really really wanted to make me banana bread and I was seeing them putting in the effort they physically didn't have the capacity to previously. It all felt very good and those are things that make me feel very loved.

The following day they were starting a new medication and they couldn't find while we were shopping two things they needed to compliment the medication they were starting. They were going to take their child to go out (it was last Sunday) to get the stuff but being in a store on a Sunday is overwhelming and their child (also ASD) was being difficult to get ready. It was my day off and I offered as I made no plans that day to go and grab the stuff for them and drop it at their door, no pressure to see them and they agreed and thanked me as I explained I was ADHD bed rotting since I made no plans and hadn't taken my medication and it would help me as well to get out of bed and start my day. I went out and got their stuff and I saw at the same store we were at previously that they stocked the heart pajama pants. I got a pair in their size excitedly and I went to the kids section and asked a worker what size they would recommend for their child's age. They helped point it out to me and I saw the only pair with hearts didn't look comfortable for a child with ASD as it had strong elastics on the ankles and waistband. I opted for a non-heart but pink very soft slightly oversized pair. I dropped it with the other stuff at their door and they were so happy a the surprise. Things were going extremely well. They were very excited on text and I said I know you have a busy day and purposely ended the conversation so they didn't feel like they HAD to keep communicating with me and so they could get some rest.

About 6-8hours later I texted them about how I liked kissing them on Saturday and was looking forward to kissing them again. I misinterpreted all the effort as being healed from burnout and boy was I wrong. I was just excited and trying to slide a need into the conversation because I didn't know how to talk about physical things as things started the first month very physical (way way more than just talking about kissing) and even though I absolutely hate pre-planned intimacy or talking about it in that robotic way I was trying to be conscious of their state and treading very lightly on the subject. They replied with the new medication is making them feel overstimulated and they hate the thought of pre-planned intimacy and the thought of kissing is extremely overwhelming although they understand those are my needs. I replied with that I actually don't like pre-planned intimacy and it was very nice to know and I said in regards to my needs other forms of intimacy are enough to fill my cup; holding hands, spending time together, they liked to sleep on my stomach I said all of those things filled my cup. They replied very upset with me and that they can see a pattern of anxiousness and they feel guilty for not having the capacity to meet my needs and they cant keep being the place to regulate or reassure me and the fact that I was talking about doing those things in the future is overwhelming for them and they don't think that our nervous systems are a good fit. This statement send me into a panic and a spiral. I thought they were breaking up with me and it hit me in the heart out of the blue. I panicked, dismissed all of my needs, said I was trying really hard and I was sorry and spilled a lot of feelings and emotions about them and the volume of messages although very kind but intense were a lot. They did not respond until the next day (Monday).

Monday they finally responded in the early morning and said that they will read the messages shortly and they like to think on things and give a good response. I cried the entire night before and hardly slept. I told them thank you and that reassurance of a response later was very kind to say and needed and that I was very upset all day. They finally replied in the evening before bed and told me rightfully that the volume and intensity of the messages are a lot. They are in immense burnout and listed all the things going on in their life in the near future and that the relationship in this form is not sustainable for them. They did not diminish my needs they said everything I was asking for is reasonable they just don't have the capacity to meet it and that the effort to maintain this especially with my anxiety and the intensity and volume of emotional texts I sent their way that I was not the place for their pain to be processed, they cannot be the regulator of my nervous system and they are not avoidant they are just in burnout (I never claimed them to be avoidant but I did in haste call it putting up walls and they did not like that analogy). I figured this was the end of my relationship. I asked wrote two last messages that just asked because it wasn't direct and felt open ended and I had absolutely no clarity that yes or no if we were able to try and work on this. They started typing and erased it. I then calmed down and I agreed with what they were saying as their points were valid and told them I'd give them all the space they needed and I was very sorry for the harm I caused as the things going on in their life was extremely important and I was draining what limited energy they had away from those things.

I told them I wouldn't reach out until they were ready.

The silence for the next 4 days we're killing me. I had massive crying bouts on the unknown of my relationship. It felt impossible to regulate the big feelings I was feeling. After two days I booked my first every therapy consultation with a neurodivergent & queer therapist. I had never been in therapy before but I wanted to find a way to regulate myself and I would do anything to be there for my partner. The earliest time I could get was Thursday.

I spent those days of no contact researching every tiktok possible and writings from academics on the dynamic of ADHD & ASD relationships and how I could be a better partner. I reposted the ones I could find, really to just be able to save them (I have no friends on tiktok other than my partner) but idiotically to signal to my partner that I was trying because I was. I would do anything. Fast forward to Thursday and I made it 4 days in no contact even though I wanted to reach out every day. I wanted to know if we had a chance to make it work. I was just talking to the therapist to get placed with a specific person and going over what was going on in my life. I was talking about the cycle tracking app and I then opened it on my phone. I forgot that it sent a notification to my partner when I did. My heart sank. I finished the consultation and had to head to work.

When I got to work, I checked the app again and I noticed I had been removed as their partner on the app and nothing showed up. I felt like I had been shot and killed. I could feel pain in my entire body. I had never felt anything like it. I panicked. I wrote them a text. I wrote:

""Hey, I want to apologize. I accidentally triggered a notification on the cycle app while talking with my therapist. I know I promised space, and I'm sorry for the disruption. I'll continue giving you space. Wishing you rest <3.""

But externally I was spiraling harder than I ever had. I stepped outside of my workplace and disappeared for 20mins. I called every single friend I have. I have a small friend group. Nobody answered and I was not okay. I made the mistake of texting their best friend who I felt already somewhat close with. I just reached out and asked if they had the capacity to talk about my partner as I didn't want to bother them during their burnout and wondering if they would do that for me. I just needed a tiny bit of clarity to regulate my nervous system so I could continue to give them space they needed and deserved. Radio silence from their friend. I was full on panic attack hyperventilating at work. People asking me if I am okay. I was not okay. Finally a friend reached out but they we're no help. I sent a follow up message to their best friend saying never mind somebody reached out and I apologized for the inappropriate reach out and breaking of a boundary.

About an hour later my partner replied to me reaming me out for breaking no contact about  the app they didn't care about the notification (I had no idea of knowing that) and that they are pissed off that I reached out to their best friend and of course their best friend is going to tell them. I told them that it felt like I was dying when I saw that and I was spiraling and panicking and in dis-array. I just needed to know if we had a chance to work it out or not and the unknown was tearing me apart. I asked if I could call them and just explain what happened to them and they didn't have to reply or respond I just needed to be heard and I was in the middle of working (I bartend) and I couldn't articulate myself. I only called them twice to no answer. They replied that everything that happened, contacting their friend, reposting publicly tiktoks about ADH & ADHD relationships (they are unaware that I have no friends on my tiktok account) and they were going to forgive that but that this was ridiculous and the two phone calls were ridiculous and they are so overwhelmed and have no capacity for this and they cant do this so there is no more future between us and they are removing me from IG & Tiktok so they can have the space they need.

I was devastated and have been going thru massive bouts of sadness every day since. I wrote one final lengthy message saying I just needed a tiny bit of reassurance or at least not the unknown so that my nervous system could be okay and if mine could be okay then I could give them that space much easier and we could heal together. I said I know what I did reaching out to her best friend was inappropriate but I felt like I was physically dying and thought being removed as the partner from the app meant it was over. I said I'm a human being with big feelings and I'm sorry and that just like their nervous system was in disrepair mine was as well. I apologized for the intensity and said I will stop messaging them and continue to work on myself and learn how to regulate myself. I said I hope in my heart that we can reconnect when we both heal and I have never felt things this strongly and I never intended harm and I am sorry. I wrote ""I'll be here waiting even if you never come back. I'll keep trying.""

I had to call my mother who I have had a very rocky and up and down past and that we don't talk about things like this and she didn't even know I was dating anybody because I was not doing well. She drove 90minutes to sleep in my studio apartment with me to make sure I was okay.

I have been able to reschedule my first therapy appointment from the 9th to the 6th as I really need it and I plan to continue to work on how to regulate my big ADHD feelings but also not shrink my needs and also learn how to navigate my ex-partners burnout if they so happen to let me back in their life.

I felt like I needed to write out the entire picture to get an accurate response on my following questions?

Is there ever a good time to break the no contact to reach out? They have a legal thing resolved in around 3 weeks time which takes a lot of energy but I have no idea if I should reach out or when given the context of our situation. I really want to be with them.

Are there any ways you would need a partner to behave or any techniques in a relationship that are helpful with this dynamic?

Is there any way to paint what folks experience during ASD burnout where I can have more understanding and clarity on the limitations and what feels good/bad from a partner during this time period?

Would you say there is any small gesture like a note or gift left at their house or a small message thinking of them that would ever be appropriate?

Any other general advice for me navigating this. I appreciate all honesty. Thank you for all who read my entire wall of text.",2,1769989772.0,autism,3,0.75,False

Through therapy and looking at patterns of my relationships, I finally see what is going on. Maria has demanded my iPhone location so she can ""see where her friends are"", but it has been weaponized. She says things like ""What were you doing at location XYZ on 7pm on Thursday?"". She ""corrects"" me frequently and says things like ""Well no, you aren't going to do that because it's not right."" for minor decisions and choices that are completely valid. She thinks everything needs to be run by her. I'll give an example, I was hanging out with ""her friend"" and she said that it felt like I was hiding things from her by not telling her that we were hanging out. She expected to be kept in the loop if we ever hung out. If Maria can't control a plan, she will sabotage it. I had people over my house and invited her and her husband and they suddenly had plans for 2 hours and then when they showed up she was in a bad attitude and ruined the entire evening and everyone went home shortly after that. She refused to look at me because I had made dinner and didn't tell her because she was going to be 2 hours late. Maria thinks that I need to justify my decisions to her and she has blown-up on me if I don't ""fill her in"". Maria speaks over me constantly and when I called her out she was rude about it and said ""This is just my leadership style. Sorry if it upsets my friends."". We work at the same company and she said ""It's likely you will be laid-off, but I am successful at work and safe."". I have been at the company more than double the amount of time as her and got her the job, but she positions herself as knowing more and being more superior. Last thing, Maria refuses to agree to a plan that is not her plan or something she can manipulate or control. I said, ""come over for coffee at 9am"", she had her husband respond and said ""We'll be over whenever Maria says she is ready."". One thing that gets me is that I was in Maria's wedding party but she decided that in order for me to be in this role I was going to be the ""beer boy"" and hand out beers to the members of the wedding audience when I walked to the alter with a belt. This was humiliating and degrading and if it were today I would say ""No."". She asks me to watch her dog like it's a privilege, yet refuses to help me with watching my dog because ""She is busy"" or ""Unavailable that day"". She has even said ""I would never ask you to watch my dog more than a few days."" even though she has. I have started saying ""No, I am not available to help you."". She was mad that I chose my dog without her being there to help make the decision. She said I was a ""liar"" because initially I said we could look at dogs together and a last minute opportunity arose for me to get a dog. She said I ""betrayed"" her.

The list goes on. She uses her husband to communicate to me. She has even convinced my friend (who is ""my friend"") that I am the problem because I am no longer doing everything she wants and that I need to be better after I set boundaries. I stopped reaching out mostly to hang out, stopped sharing my iPhone location, and don't share a lot of information with her. She has lost access and I am tired of the dominance bullsh\*t. I don't believe I was ever really a friend to her. She just wants to be dominant, push me down, control me, and get things out of me. I have stopped offering this.

EMBARKATION: It went well. Carnival had announced the night before that there might be a lot of traffic so try to get there early. They basically let everyone who was at the port at 1100 get on the ship which was fine by me. 

ROOM: We booked a balcony room on the spa deck, 12. What a great choice that was. We had the balcony at the far forward cabin and the view was spectacular. The perks for being on the spa deck are nice. Unlimited access to the Thalasso pool and the thermal suite is great. 

FOOD: I know a lot of people have a negative opinion about the food but we loved it! From the main dining room, the breakfast and lunch buffet, the Mongolian wok, the pizza, the seafood shack, Guy’s burgers and the Blue Iguana, we did not have a bad meal. We also booked dinner at the Italian restaurant and the steakhouse. They were both spectacular and highly recommended. 

ENTERTAINMENT: We had so much fun on the ship. We saw two of the shows in the theater. The standout was “Flick.” It was a musical that featured songs from movies. It was amazing. We also caught the late night comedian at the comedy club. He was really good. We had a blast with the trivia competitions. The casino was nice. 

SERVICE: This is where the Carnival Magic shines in my opinion. To a person, every single crew member was friendly, helpful, and cheerful. They really go the extra mile and it shows. Our room steward Michael was great. Everyone was. 

Ports of call: We booked Waterfalls, Buggies and Monkeys in DR. This was an excursion that took most of the day. It was a lot of fun. Getting to do three activities in one excursion seemed like a bargain. At San Juan we just walked into the city and to one of the forts. We had coffee and then later had a nice lunch then walked back to the ship. At St. Maarten we took the Jeep and beach escape excursion. This was a guided tour that went all the way around the island to the French side, to Maho Beach and a few other stops along the way. Ending at a private beach area for swimming and relaxing. It was a lot of fun. At St. Thomas we did some shopping then took a taxi to Magen’s Bay. That was the best port in my opinion. I loved the beach there. We may look into flying there for a longer visit. 

Then it was two sea days. We ran into some rough water on the way back to Miami due to a strong cold front. Not much could be done about that of course. 

DISEMBARKATION: The only part of this that was a hassle was finding our luggage among a sea of people. This process could use some streamlining. 

NEGATIVES: There were very few. Of course the ship is a bit older so there were some rough edges. Some of the carpet was old and some parts of the ship are dated. Dry dock should take care of that. The biggest negative for me was some rude fellow passengers. One guy sitting near us at dinner loudly complained the entire time he was there. In fact, he asked to “file a formal complaint” because his steak wasn’t the right shape. I’m not making this up.

We had a great vacation and are going to plan another cruise next year with some family. Probably Alaska.

*Taste every shot you pull.*

I've since expanded that to include pourovers and taste black  even if you intend to drink with milk. 

Now that I'm roasting, I've discovered that tastimh mistakes applies iin this niche as well. 

I had a couple of batches of Sumatras that got away from my medium/medium dark target and got very dark, oily beans at 20 and 21% weight loss. I would never deliberately buy these from a commercial roaster. Not my favorite level and they clog my DF54.

However  I ground  them in my Baratza Encore ESP and have to say I've developed a real liking for these dark beans in my Breves. Deep, bittet chocolate topped with some spice notes. 

I try to avoid bitter notes but this is somehow different - satisfying. 

If I weren't roasting, I may never have tried this roast level and would have missed out on a delicious drink. 

Just passing thoughts. Oh  and the medium roasts are also great. Wonder how the Sumatran light roast will taste - another batch that I missed trying for medium roasts. They're resting right now.

I then asked my doctor to prescribe a compounded version, but she declined. As a result, I went without medication for a couple of weeks. By the end of the second week off the medication, food noise returned strongly, to the point where it felt overwhelming.

About a week after it became available, I started Wegovy 1.5 mg (oral). Here are my reflections so far:

•	It took several days to build up in my system.

•	I strongly recommend waiting the full 30 minutes, and possibly 35 minutes, before having coffee or food.

•	The medication makes it slower for me to get going in the morning.

•	Now that it has built up, I experience appetite suppression for about 10 hours after taking it.

•	By around 7:00 PM, I start thinking about food again and feel noticeably hungry.

•	Even after eating a reasonable dinner, I still feel hungry afterward.

•	I have lost about 2 pounds since starting the pill, which feels acceptable but slower than before.

•	Food noise is still significant, especially during the last waking hour of the day.

Because of this, I plan to ask my doctor to increase my dose for the next month.

•	I walk about 9,000 steps per day

I have noticed that I only get them after sex (even if me and my partner shower, pee after, etc.) For some background context:

I have kept the same sexual partner for over 2 years. I do not have multiple partners and do not “sleep around” My partner (19M) knows of my issues and plays his part with his personal hygiene and other factors that may contribute to my problem. He understands and does his best to be attentive with his hygiene to not cause any further issues for me. He has no symptoms or issues on his end.

I have tested negative for STDS and do not have any common STD symptoms such as weird odors, discharge, itching, burning, etc. I have also tested negative for mycoplasma.

I do not use scented soaps, lube, or foreign products on my private area. I do not have anal sex.

In short, I do not have any vaginal symptoms. When I get seen at a clinic, 9 times out of ten, my urine labs show positive results for the bacteria Klebsiella Pneumoniae. Does anyone know where this bacteria comes from? Or any ideas as to why it is consistently in my urine?

I have UTI symptoms but at times have tested negative. These symptoms include frequent urination, sudden urination that has (sorry) caused me to urinate myself at times, my urine has an odor that varies from eggs/sulphur to sweet like a sweet corn? My urine is sometimes pale and cloudy, and other times is dark like honey. 

I can admit and understand that some of my issues may be a lack of hydration. I have started drinking more water and prefer water over sodas, coffees, etc. My diet is not the greatest (I have a sweet tooth) and I have started working on eating better.

During intercourse, I sometimes experience pain during sex, feeling like my body is too tight or tense to allow penetration which i assume causes micro tears or abrasions inside due to the stretching of my body. One night, i was having intercourse with my partner and we added a water based lube about halfway through. i’ve never had issues but when it was inserted, but this time i had immediate burning which i assume is from the internal tearing or abrasions? Does this signal a tight/pelvic floor issue?

Has anyone else experienced these same issues? What do you recommend? What has or has not worked for you? I am currently in the process of getting an appointment with a Urologist but I am anxious in medical settings and am highly anxious for things like a cystoscopy, etc. (anything that lacks privacy of my private areas SCARES me.)

1qteql8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1qteql8/how_to_become_a_high_value_man_the/,How to Become a High Value Man: The Psychology-Based Blueprint That Actually Works,"Let me be real with you. The internet is flooded with surface-level advice about becoming a ""high value man,"" but most of it's recycled garbage. After diving deep into psychology research, behavioral science, and countless hours of podcasts and books, I've found what actually separates high value men from everyone else. It's not about fancy cars or fake confidence. It's about genuine self mastery, emotional intelligence, and building real competence.

Here's what nobody tells you: society makes it ridiculously hard to develop these traits. We're bombarded with instant gratification, comparison culture on social media, and messages that say you need to look or act a certain way. Your biology doesn't help either, your brain is wired for short term rewards, not long term growth. But here's the thing, once you understand these forces working against you, you can actually work with them. The practical strategies I'm sharing below are backed by science and real world results.

# Step 1: Master Your Mind First

You can't build external value without internal strength. High value starts from the inside out.

Read ""Can't Hurt Me"" by David Goggins. This book will punch you in the face (in the best way). Goggins was a 300 pound exterminator who transformed himself into a Navy SEAL and ultra marathon runner. The book isn't just his story, it's a manual for mental toughness. What makes this different from other self help books is the ""challenge"" format. After each chapter, Goggins gives you an actual task to push your limits. I'm not gonna lie, some of these challenges made me question my entire existence. But that discomfort? That's where growth lives. This is hands down the best book on mental resilience I've ever read. You'll finish it feeling like you can run through a brick wall.

Pair this with the Stoic philosophy. Download the app Stoic. It gives you daily meditations and practical exercises based on Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and Epictetus. These ancient philosophers understood something crucial: you can't control external events, but you can control your response. The app breaks down complex Stoic principles into bite sized lessons you can actually apply when life gets chaotic. Takes 5 minutes a day, but the perspective shift is massive.

# Step 2: Build Genuine Competence

High value men aren't just talkers, they're doers. They have skills that create real world value.

Read ""So Good They Can't Ignore You"" by Cal Newport. Newport is a computer science professor at Georgetown who studied how people build remarkable careers. This book destroys the ""follow your passion"" myth. Instead, Newport argues you need to develop rare and valuable skills first, then passion and opportunities follow. He calls it ""career capital."" The book is packed with case studies of people who became exceptional by focusing on deliberate practice rather than chasing feelings. After reading this, I completely changed how I approach skill building. It's the ultimate guide for building competence that actually matters.

Apply this through deliberate practice. Pick one skill that aligns with your goals (public speaking, coding, writing, fitness, whatever). Then use the principles from Newport's book: push yourself slightly beyond your comfort zone, get immediate feedback, and repeat. Track your progress with an app like Habitica, which gamifies your habit building. You create a character that levels up as you complete real life tasks. Sounds cheesy, but the dopamine hit from ""leveling up"" actually rewires your brain to crave progress.

# Step 3: Develop Emotional Intelligence

This is where most men drop the ball. You can be competent as hell, but if you can't navigate emotions (yours and others'), you'll hit a ceiling.

Read ""Attached"" by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller. This book explains attachment theory in relationships, and it's a game changer. The authors are psychiatrists who break down the three attachment styles: secure, anxious, and avoidant. Understanding your attachment style (and recognizing it in others) gives you a blueprint for healthier relationships, whether romantic or professional. The book is based on decades of psychological research but written in plain English. I've recommended this to at least 20 people, and every single one said it made them understand their relationship patterns for the first time. Insanely good read.

For deeper emotional work, try the app Ash. It's like having a relationship and mental health coach in your pocket. The AI asks you reflective questions about your emotions, patterns, and behaviors. It's not therapy, but it helps you build emotional awareness, which is the foundation of emotional intelligence. The conversations feel surprisingly natural, and you start noticing patterns you've been blind to.

# Step 4: Take Care of Your Body

Physical health directly impacts mental clarity, confidence, and how others perceive you. This isn't vanity, it's biology.

Read ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear. This is the best book on behavior change, period. Clear breaks down how tiny changes compound into remarkable results. The book is organized around four laws of behavior change: make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, and make it satisfying. What makes this book different is the focus on systems over goals. You don't need superhuman willpower, you need better systems. Clear uses research from neuroscience and psychology to show exactly how habits form and how to reshape them. This book will change how you approach literally everything in your life.

Track your fitness with simple systems. Use Clear's ""habit stacking"" technique: attach new habits to existing ones. Already brush your teeth? Do 10 pushups right after. Already make coffee? Do 2 minutes of stretching while it brews. These micro habits build momentum without overwhelming you.

# Step 5: Learn to Lead and Communicate

High value men know how to influence and inspire others without being manipulative or arrogant.

Listen to the podcast ""The Tim Ferriss Show."" Ferriss interviews world class performers from every field, athletes, entrepreneurs, scientists, artists. What makes this podcast valuable is how he deconstructs their habits, routines, and mental frameworks. You're not just hearing success stories, you're getting the actual playbook. Episodes range from 1 to 3 hours, perfect for deep dives. Start with his interviews with Jocko Willink (leadership), Derek Sivers (unconventional thinking), or BJ Miller (perspective on life and death).

Practice communication skills actively. Join a local Toastmasters club or take an improv class. Both force you to think on your feet and communicate clearly under pressure. These aren't just ""nice to have"" skills, they're essential for leadership and building genuine connections.

# Step 6: Build Financial Intelligence

Money isn't everything, but financial stress destroys your quality of life and limits your options.

Read ""The Psychology of Money"" by Morgan Housel. Forget dry finance textbooks. Housel is a former Wall Street Journal columnist who explains money through the lens of human behavior. The book has 20 short chapters, each exploring a different psychological aspect of wealth building. It's not about getting rich quick, it's about understanding your relationship with money and making smarter long term decisions. The writing is so engaging that you'll finish it in a weekend and immediately want to restructure your finances.

Use apps like YNAB (You Need A Budget) or Monarch Money to actually implement what you learn. Awareness is the first step to financial control. These apps help you see where your money actually goes and make intentional choices instead of reactive ones.

For those wanting to go deeper without spending hours reading every book cover to cover, there's BeFreed. It's a personalized learning app built by AI experts from Google that pulls from books like the ones mentioned here, plus research papers and expert interviews on personal development and psychology. 

You set a specific goal, like ""build confidence as an introvert"" or ""develop leadership skills in my 20s,"" and it creates an adaptive learning plan just for you. Each lesson comes as a custom podcast you can listen to during your commute or workout. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with real examples when something really clicks. The voice options are surprisingly good, some people swear by the smoky, conversational tone that makes complex psychology feel like a friend explaining it over coffee. Makes the whole self improvement process way more structured and way less overwhelming.

# Step 7: Cultivate Your Own Standards

High value men don't chase validation. They have strong internal standards and stick to them.

Read ""Models"" by Mark Manson. Yeah, it's technically a dating book, but it's really about authentic self expression and vulnerability. Manson argues that attraction isn't about tricks or tactics, it's about becoming genuinely comfortable with who you are and expressing that boldly. The book is raw, honest, and packed with counterintuitive insights about confidence and relationships. Even if you're not focused on dating, the principles about living authentically and setting boundaries apply everywhere.

Practice saying no. High value men protect their time and energy. Start declining things that don't align with your values or goals, even if it's uncomfortable. Your time is your most valuable resource. Treat it that way.

The path to becoming high value isn't about faking it or following some cookie cutter formula. It's about genuine self development: building mental toughness, real skills, emotional intelligence, physical health, leadership ability, financial wisdom, and authentic standards. These books and tools give you the blueprint. Now you just need to do the work.",1,1769989231.0,MotivationByDesign,0,1.0,False

Maria has demanded my iPhone location so she can ""see where her friends are"", but it has been weaponized. She says things like ""What were you doing at location XYZ on 7pm on Thursday?"". She ""corrects"" me frequently and says things like ""Well no, you aren't going to do that because it's not right."" for minor decisions and choices that are completely valid.

She was mad that I chose my dog without her being there to help make the decision. She said I was a ""liar"" because initially I said we could look at dogs together and a last minute opportunity arose for me to get a dog. She said I ""betrayed"" her.

The list goes on. She uses her husband to communicate to me.

1qtenbu,https://x.com/i/status/2016968877557653927,New app by bank social,"I pulled this from Gemini. 

Since you are interested in both, here is how the Credit Union of Texas (CUTX) integration works for a regular user, followed by a breakdown of the new Nuron AI features.
​1. The Credit Union of Texas (CUTX) Experience
​If you are a member of CUTX, you don't actually need to download a separate ""crypto app"" to get started. The integration is designed to be invisible and seamless.
​How it looks to a user:
​Single Login: You log into your normal CUTX mobile banking app or website just like you would to check your checking account balance.
​New ""Digital Assets"" Tab: Inside the app, you will see a new section alongside your Checking and Savings accounts. This is where your crypto (Bitcoin, HBAR, Ethereum, etc.) lives.
​Buying & Selling: You can move money from your CUTX checking account instantly to buy crypto. Conversely, you can sell your crypto and have the cash immediately available in your checking account to spend with your debit card.
​The ""Hidden"" Wallet: When you click ""Enable"" on this feature, the system creates a self-custody wallet for you in the background.
​Crucial Detail: Even though it looks like the bank is holding the crypto (like PayPal or Coinbase), they are not. You own the private keys, but the DeRec system (using the Credit Union as a ""helper"") manages the security so you don't have to worry about losing a seed phrase.
​Who is this for?
This is for the person who wants to own Bitcoin or Hedera but is terrified of ""losing their keys"" or getting hacked. It gives you the safety of a bank with the ownership of a cold wallet.
​2. The Nuron AI (The ""Thinking"" Engine)
​Nuron is the name of the AI infrastructure that BankSocial launched in late 2025. It acts as a ""brain"" that sits between the blockchain and the banking interface.
​While the CUTX integration is about access, Nuron is about automation.
​Key Features for Users:
​""Wealth to Spend"": This is the flagship feature. Nuron can instantly convert different asset classes for payments.
​Example: You are at a coffee shop. You don't have cash, but you have Apple Stock or HBAR. You can use your card, and Nuron will intelligently sell the exact amount of stock/crypto required to pay for the coffee in milliseconds.
​Autonomous Agents: Instead of manually bridging tokens or calculating gas fees, you can give Nuron an intent-based command.
​Command: ""Swap 50% of my Bitcoin into Stablecoins if the price drops below $90k.""
​Nuron watches the market 24/7 and executes this for you, navigating the complex DeFi steps automatically.
​Fraud Protection (Secura): Nuron monitors your transactions in real-time. If it sees a transaction that looks like a ""wallet drainer"" contract or a known scam address, it can freeze the transaction before it settles on the blockchain, something standard crypto wallets generally cannot do.
​The ""Remint"" Update (Jan 2026):
Just last week (late Jan 2026), they announced a feature called Remint as part of Nuron. This allows for ""Agentic Payments""—meaning AI agents can pay other AI agents.
​Future Use Case: Your electric car could have its own wallet. It negotiates a price with a charging station and pays for the charge automatically using your stablecoins, without you ever taking out your phone.
​Summary: Which one is right for you?
​Use the CUTX Integration if: You want a safe, bank-backed way to buy and hold crypto without technical headaches.
​Look into Nuron/BankSocial App if: You are a ""power user"" who wants to use crypto for payments, set up automated trading rules, or interact with the broader Web3 world using AI assistance.
​Would you like to know if there are other Credit Unions besides CUTX that have gone live, or how to get the standalone BankSocial app if you aren't a CUTX member?",9,1769989008.0,Hedera,1,0.8,False
1qten68,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qten68/fn_tom_discovers_a_letter/,[FN] Tom Discovers a Letter,"“A letter to my uncle, Chev the Third. Well, I wonder who could this—”  
 Tom stopped short as he opened the envelope, sealed with a dragon’s claw pressed into red candle wax, a faint glint of gold tracing its outline. He recognized the writing the moment he unfolded it fully.

It was his father’s writing—a man supposedly dead for thirty years.

“Father… Dad?”

His heart fell like needles striking with every beat, each one sharper than the last. His inner body felt hollow, every pulse filling the emptiness like an eternal echo through his soul and mind. The vibration grew stronger, more intense with each second.

He frowned, squeezing his eyes shut to stop himself from crying. This couldn’t be. He’d been dead for years. He missed my birthdays—my, my… my graduation from Garden Transition School, my graduation from West Lake Academy, then… University of… of… Uv… uv—

His lips began to shiver as he read. He was still—

“Brother Chev, if you have received this letter, I am writing to remind you that my assets and funds are now fully available to you and my son. I apologize for my passing and this dreadful disease. I only wish I had more time. The best I could do was send letters, prepared in time capsules, for the mail officials to release in a timely manner—hoping, and predicting, that you and Tom are still well and taken care of.”

Dead as a rock. Lifeless. Dead.

Tom kept reading as a single tear slipped down his cheek. The shivering stopped. Hope vanished as if the gates of hell were slowly opening. He had hoped too soon—irrationally.

Just accept it. They’re both dead.  
 Just accept it already.  
 Dumb heart. Stop hoping.

“I need you to travel to Thyrack Center, to the Bank of Bigsby Bobbles. Upon arrival, speak to the manager. She is a short little temp being—an excellent accountant and sharp to the teeth when it comes to deadlines and project resources. I made sure she was placed in charge of my account, my funds, and the capsule letters to be sent to you. If done correctly, she will mark the envelope with the government prestige seal.”

The dragon’s haste mark. For one gold and five silver, the government delivery service ensured the envelope reached your front door. They marked it in their invoice—no second-guessing—and left a receipt confirming they had done their part and that you had received yours. Perfect if you wished to sue someone, send urgent invites, or deliver bills.

“Now, there is a problem. Klara Junthsier is a bit decluttered at the moment. As of now, you will need to make your way to the city. I am certain traveling has become easier since my passing—thirty years is enough time, I can only hope for transportation and public rye lines to have finally connected to our town.”

They had not.

The local councils barely secured any funds after each election. Every cycle it was the same: increase security, increase the army, increase public infrastructure, clean water—then raise property taxes another minor two percent, invite more merchants to set up shops, and open yet another coffee house on every corner.

Drug addicts. All of them.

“Within a week, my account shall be closed per city law. If not claimed, my funds will be transferred to the government. So make haste. You should arrive by carriage or horse—or whatever inventions the dwarves have come up with—within two days.”

It was a six-day walk without rest. With rest, ten.

“Either you or Tom could go. Now—”

Unfortunately, Uncle Chev had gone to the Eastern Lands of Grogieria to visit his “lady friend.” Tom still couldn’t figure out whether she was his partner, his wife, or simply a friend. He didn’t bother to ask.

He did, however, enjoy the solitude.

*Fuck, I have to go now*.





As he gathered himself, Tom collected the belongings of his late father—whatever food and snacks he could carry, along with the magic gourd that turned foul, nasty water into clean, drinkable, good old crystal-clear refreshment. As he packed, the letter still had more to say, but he paid it no attention. Time itself demanded payment if he hesitated. He had to go.

And if Tom *had* read the remaining letter, this is what he would have discovered:

“Tom, I know I left you too early in this world. But I want you to know that I knew you were going to be an amazing individual—full of talent and intelligence. You would quickly pick up on clues and plans in your mind faster than I could ever conceive a name for you. Every father, every parent, knows this when they watch their little ones grow.

But heed this, son—child—Tom. Your mother did not abandon you. She is still alive. She will return within two months. Prepare her for the grave news, and make sure she receives the crystal pendalement. I hid it beneath the bed. She will need it to contact me.”

Like that, Tom never read the rest.

He dashed forth in his father’s uniform, \*\*making haste like a dragon in pursuit of gold—bypassing bridges, fees, and doubt itself—\*\*seeking adventure, seeking escape, seeking the breaking of the boredom that had bound his life within his uncle’s inherited home, once his father’s own.

He looked into the mirror at his uncle’s door, he saw himself. He looked almost like his pops. A faint warmth slivered in his heart. He nodded and left.",3,1769988997.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I am a man who finds as much resonance in a Byron soliloquy as I do in a heavy session at the gym. My interests are broad ...from the complexities of Indian federalism and history to the raw, amateur soul of making music. I’m looking for a woman who is my intellectual and emotional equal, someone I can vibe with over Bengali poetry or fitness goals.

I am a composed man in my public life, but I believe that a truly deep connection should be built on absolute honesty and a bit of a bittersweet edge. I’m looking for a slow-burn, ""friends-to-lovers"" journey where our bond is the anchor for everything else we explore.

The Connection:

I’ve always felt that the most intense relationships are those where there is a certain level of vulnerability and uninhibited trust. I want to be the man who truly knows your heart...the one you share your day with, your music with, and your secrets with. I am drawn to the complex, intense dynamic of cuckolding, where I am your primary partner and sanctuary, yet find a visceral, possessive thrill in seeing you explore your desires with others. I want to be the one who welcomes you back, hears the details, and shows you exactly why I’m the one you chose to keep.

What I’m Looking For:
Intellectual Spark: Someone to discuss Manfred in the morning or debate politics over coffee.
Shared Growth: Whether it's gym progress or dabbling in new poetry, I want to grow alongside you.
Emotional Depth: I value the bittersweet feeling of being the one you always come home to. I want to be the person who hears everything about your experiences and loves you more for it.

I’m a ""winner"" in my public life, but I want to be the one who listens and understands you in private. If you’re a woman who isn't afraid to be herself and wants a partner who can match your mind and your spirit, I’d love to connect.

Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 30 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one special someone that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in a real, genuine connection and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of meeting a long term partner, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring person. An individual that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in that special someone. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is ready to make it work with a guy named shadow\_surf haha.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a partner?

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* Loyal, trusting, and honest
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual

Also a pair of new shoes with flat heels. There had been whispers \[...\] ""Sorry, she's too tall.""

Tall, leggy, adolescent, very young, very virginal fourteen-year old.  Enormous brown eyes, wide open \[...\] in an almost perpetual state of shock and embarrassment at being parade before groups of strange people in an office. 

""Give us a profile, honey."" (What's a profile?) ""Here, Turn your face this way!"" A heavy hairy-backed hand grasping the chin, turning it toward an awkward shoulder. ""That's fine, dear."" The hand sliding down over an underdeveloped breast. Suddenly tense, frightened, wanting to run. ""Can't you smile, cutie? That's better.""

""Cutie! I was anything but 'cute,' and besides, something innate told me it was an undignified word. I expected my father to swing on him, as he was a dignified man. \[...\] But nothing happened. A subservient smile was glued to his face.""

(Can’t believe I’m saying this),"TLDR: Genuinely so appreciative of this sub and after a long up and down journey with GLP-1’s I am finally regulated and so freaking happy! Zero negative side effects, on 2mg every 3 days.

Hi all! I’ve been following this sub and the main Reta one for about a year. Just wanted to share my journey and say thank you to all the other amazing women that I’ve admired posts from!

I previously took Ozempic from April 2024-April 2025 taking 1 mg/week. I lost 23 pounds in that year, having a very active job and eating very well might I add. My starting weight was 159lbs and my lowest weight on it was 136lbs. Likely was just too small of a dose but it was costing me $300 a month and couldn’t afford to go any higher.

I have a history of PCOS and have had nothing but weight fluctuations, IBS issues, hormonal imbalance especially with hot temperatures, acne, constant inflammation, etc. my whole adult life. After the first month of Ozempic I genuinely couldn’t believe the benefits and how literally all of the above symptoms had vanished. I was finally regulated!

For reference I’m 5‘2, and 28 yrs currently, and because of my height even the smallest weight fluctuations would feel massive on me and clothes would very quickly not fit/fit etc.

Fast forward to last fall, having taken the summer off of the meds due to cost, I regained weight back up to 149lbs. I genuinely eat very well, take my supplements, mainly eat meat and greens, the occasional ice cream and coffee here and there, and try to drink lots of water. I’m known in my friend group as the crazy healthy one lol.

So after having researched Reta as much as possible over the summer, I finally ordered a bunch at the end of September 2025 (second attempt after getting the first one to be seized by customs - Canada lol. Ps. If anyone knows if that letter in the mail stops me from reapplying for my Nexus please help a girl out).

It’s now been four months of taking Reta and again, I am blown away!

In these four months I have lost 17lbs, a little over 1 pound a week, so slow and steady. I started at a very low dose, 0.25 mg, felt soothing to my internal system and IBS almost immediately but took a very long time to notice any kind of weight loss, which felt pretty frustrating. It’s really just been this last month. I now know I was just on too low of a dose, everyone says to start slow and low for my system though so I’m glad I did it that way, and now I take 2 mg every three days and it feels like the sweet spot between my appetite suppressing, types of cravings as I get, steady weight loss, and in all honesty I have zero negative side effects. I am shocked and amazed.

The one thing I could say is I do feel more fatigued than normal, even with sleeping 9 hours a night, and this might be a combination of Reta as well as I was really sick this past month and I’m currently job searching so my system might just generally be overwhelmed and exhausted. Also seem to have skipped my period this month but I also have an hormonal IUD so that mixed with Reta mixed with life circumstance and illness I’m pretty sure it explains it. And no, I’m for sure not pregnant.

Some things that truly blow me away, I feel like when I look at myself in the mirror I can notice way less inflammation in my face, and my hands have shrunk so much, like down 1.5 ring sizes, can’t wear any of my rings anymore! Not complaining but just funny didn’t expect it. That said, when I look at myself naked I feel like I look the same just smaller in all areas, mind you I have not been strength training or doing heavy exercise because I have a physical job and just don’t have the energy on top of it, something I want to fix this summer. But when I put on clothes, ones that I couldn’t even get over my thighs two years ago, they literally slide on with wiggle room and I’m just so pleasantly perplexed! I’ve had discomfort around body dysmorphia for a lot of my life so I wasn’t weighing myself every week on Reta. Just gauging it by how I fit into old clothes and jeans etc. Again can’t say enough, I’m blown away. I’ve gone down 3 pant sizes.

The reality? More like sweat, navigating confusing bus routes, and a fair share of awkward silences. But, ironically, it was also where I unlocked the secret to truly amazing, ridiculously cheap food that made every misstep worth it.

Let's be real: Instagram often lies. My first solo adventure to Southeast Asia wasn't picture-perfect. There were moments of genuine loneliness, times I felt completely overwhelmed, and more than one occasion where I ate instant noodles because I was too shy to order something new. But then, I learned to eat like a local, and that’s when things really shifted.

Here’s a snapshot of my ""un-glamorous"" first solo trip and what I picked up along the way:

*   **Destination & Duration:**
    *   **Where:** Vietnam (Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, a quick detour to Hoi An).
    *   **When:** Three weeks, late spring.
*   **The Budget Breakdown (roughly):**
    *   **Flights:** My biggest splurge. Around $900 round trip from the US. Booked a bit last minute – rookie mistake.
    *   **Accommodation:** Hostels and budget guesthouses. Averaged $8-15/night for a decent dorm bed or a very basic private room.
    *   **Transport (local):** Buses, Grab (their version of Uber/Lyft), and walking. Maybe $5-10/day tops.
    *   **Activities:** Temples, markets, scooter tours. Very affordable, often just a few dollars for entrance fees.
    *   **Food (the game changer):** This is where I saved *big*. Once I got the hang of it, I was spending around **$5-10 a day** on incredible meals.

**The Real Talk & How I Found My Street Food Zen:**

The initial days were a blur of trying to look confident while secretly panicking. I ate at tourist traps because they had English menus, and the food was... fine. Overpriced and forgettable. But a few days in, fueled by a shrinking budget and a desperate craving for something authentic, I had to change tack.

Here's my no-fail, honest guide to finding the good stuff:

1.  **Follow the Locals (Seriously, don't overthink it):** If a stall has a line of Vietnamese people, especially at odd hours, it's a good sign. If it's empty, or full of tourists speaking your language, maybe walk on.
2.  **Look for High Turnover:** Stalls with lots of fresh ingredients being constantly replenished mean the food hasn't been sitting around. This is crucial for both taste and safety.
3.  **Simple Menus are King:** The best places usually specialize in one or two dishes. They've perfected them. Don't go for the place with 50 options; go for the one that does *pho* or *banh mi* perfectly.
4.  **Embrace the Point-and-Smile Method:** Language barrier? No problem. Point at what others are eating, or point at the ingredients you want. A smile and a ""cảm ơn"" (thank you) go a long way.
5.  **Don't Fear the Plastic Stools:** The lower to the ground you are, the more authentic (and often delicious) the experience. These aren't fancy restaurants; they're communal eating spots.
6.  **My Best Street Food Discoveries (for dirt cheap):**
    *   **Phở Bò (Beef Noodle Soup):** A steaming bowl of pure comfort for about $1.50 - $2. In Hanoi, I found a stall near my hostel that became my daily ritual.
    *   **Bánh Mì (Vietnamese Sandwich):** My on-the-go savior. Fresh baguette, pâté, grilled pork, herbs, pickled veggies – all for $1! I ate these for breakfast, lunch, and snacks.
    *   **Cà Phê Sữa Đá (Iced Coffee with Condensed Milk):** Essential fuel. Sweet, strong, and addictive. About $1 a cup.
    *   **Bún Chả (Grilled Pork with Noodles):** A Hanoi specialty. Flavorful grilled pork patties and slices in a sweet, savory broth, served with vermicelli noodles and fresh herbs. Maybe $2-3.

The challenges were real – the sensory overload, the solo navigation, the occasional feeling of being utterly alone in a crowd. But those moments of finding a bustling street food stall, ordering something delicious with a mix of pointing and broken phrases, and savoring every bite on a tiny plastic stool, surrounded by locals – those were the *real* ""once-in-a-lifetime"" moments for me. It wasn't about the perfect photo; it was about the experience, the taste, and the realization that I could figure things out.

1qtean7,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1qtean7/advice/,Advice,Ok so I’m a 39yr old bi married man to a woman. We’ve been together a long time and over the last few years I’ve shared my interests and feelings about being bi. She absolutely wasn’t into it but had started pegging me which I love and buying me panties and female clothes. Well this morning she approached me while drinking my morning coffee and expressed how she wants to now have an open marriage. I know she isn’t looking nor was I. She insists that this is something I should do since we’ve been together since high school. Ashe admits she has a lot lower sex drive and enjoys basic vanilla missionary sex. Saying she feels I would be happier to find a friend with benefits outside the marriage whether it’s a woman into pegging men or another man itself. I appreciate her wanting me to be happy and I do love her. I don’t know how to process this and what I should do. I would love to find a guy to hang out with and explore a little as well. She says she doesn’t care just doesn’t want me to show pictures or bring it home to her. I’m lost. I’m still trying to process things.

Before the pill, I would start my day by taking 2 caffeine mints (I use the viter energy ones). I usually chew them and let them dissolve in my mouth rather than swallowing.

I know a big struggle for everyone is the wait between getting up and having coffee. 30 min isn’t bad but I know the most ideal is waiting multiple hrs to have anything by mouth.

I am wondering if caffeine in something like gum/dissolved mints would still interact with absorption due to something else like blood vessel constriction etc…

Curious if anyone else uses these!",0,1769988034.0,WegovyPillWeightLoss,1,0.5,False
