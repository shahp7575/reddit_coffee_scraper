I‚Äôm a writer, actor, and Ireland‚Äôs foremost (and only) stammering comedian. And in two weeks I will be shooting my short film Stutterbug!

**What‚Äôs Stutterbug about?**

Aidan is a man with a stutter who just wants one thing: coffee. But as his day unfolds, his attempts to hide his stutter cause him to accidentally tell a charity worker to f\*\*k off, ruin his chances with his college crush, Jess, by unintentionally insulting her proud stuttering brother Sean and, worst of all, order a mocha instead of an americano.

Aidan is all of us. He is ashamed of who he is, and he goes to extreme lengths to hide it, and hilarity ensues...at his own expense.

I know you wish you could have a sneak peek at it now...oh how lucky you are! By clicking this [link](https://youtu.be/VunSz_R_cQk) you'll be able to see our Proof Of Concept, a little taster of what's to come!

**Why am I making this movie?**

Growing up, I never saw a portrayal of stuttering that reflected my reality. Too often, characters who stutter are punchlines, villains, or ‚Äúinspirational‚Äù figures overcoming their ‚Äúflaws.‚Äù

The last time a stuttering actor played a stuttering character was in 1937, when Joe Dougherty voiced Porky Pig‚Äîuntil he was fired for stuttering too much. THIS IS A REAL FACT LOOK IT UP!

This is my chance to change that. Stutterbug is written by someone who stutters, starring not one but **two actors who stutter** (take that Porky), and it tells an authentic story of stuttering‚Äînot as inspiration porn or a joke, but as part of a real, three-dimensional character.

**Who are the Stuttering Actors?**

***Aidan Greene***

Aidan Greene is Ireland‚Äôs foremost (and only) stuttering stand-up comedian. Since 2010, he has headlined major comedy festivals, including the Vodafone Comedy Festival, The Cat Laughs, and the Edinburgh Fringe, where he has had seven sold-out runs.

An accomplished storyteller, Aidan‚Äôs work has been featured on The Moth Radio Hour, reaching over 30 million listeners. He holds an MA in screenwriting and has worked with several Irish production companies. A passionate advocate for stuttering awareness, Aidan regularly speaks at events and recently hosted ‚ÄúThe Stammies,‚Äù the British Stammering Association‚Äôs first-ever stuttering awards.

***Scroobius Pip***

Scroobius Pip is a rapper, spoken word artist, actor, and host of the podcast Distraction Pieces. As an actor, he‚Äôs appeared in Taboo (BBC), Venom: Let There Be Carnage (FOX), and Debris (NBC Universal), working with stars like Tom Hardy and Stephen Graham. A proud person who stutters, Pip is a patron of STAMMA, the British Stammering Association. His involvement in Stutterbug brings invaluable representation and passion to the project.

**How You Can Help?**

In the past six months, Stutterbug reached the finals of both the Virgin Media Discovers and Shore Scripts Short Film Fund competitions. Now, we‚Äôre ready to make the movie‚Äîbut we need your help. We've launched a Go-Fund-Me which has had a great reception but we're still short of the amount of money we need to make the movie.

I've been engaged for 2,5 years, and we keep getting struck at the guest list since we aren't millionaires and can't invite everyone.

The solution is to have a micro wedding, and then I'll make my next birthday party a big dance party, where I can invite everyone. Bonus for not stressing over formalities and traditions.

I finally booked the venue, and it's crazy cheap because of good connections. All is well. I'll break the day up into coffee and cake in the afternoon, where kids and older family members are welcome. The evening will have a simple meal, lots of garden games and a dancefloor of doom.

BUT! I'm sitting with a spreadsheet, and even though I've broken it up into two parties basically, I'm still working with an A-list and a B-list for the evening ting. It's a 45 person venue, and I figure I can squeeze in 5 more.

Kendu is a memecoin that is on 3 chains: Ethereum, Solana and BASE, Kendu is focused on organic, non KOL, growth. We are entirely community led, focusing on both social media and IRL events/products. Kendu has completely captured social media, I am sure you would heard about Kendu or at least seen our name somewhere. We have around 18k holders and this is growing even in this market. Kendu ATH Market Cap was 283 million, back in June 2024, which is around a 30x from this value. Since then Kendu has went through some painful redistributions, which all coins will need to go through at some point. However, when ETH wakes up, we are pretty confident Kendu is guaranteed to reach ATH. In my opinion(not financial advice), buying Kendu at this price removes all risk from the investment. In the community, we are planning to have multiple more chill VCs in the telegram, which I welcome everyone to join, whether you are a holder or not.

Josh is also gonna start some X(Twitter) spaces on the main Kendu account, which I advise everyone to join, to get a taste of Kendu. In addition, any holders should also join this.

Kendu has multiple international communities incase English is not your first language:üáÆüá≥¬†India,üá™üá∏¬†Spanish,üá¶üá™¬†Arabic, üá´üá∑¬†French, üá©üá™¬†German, üáµüáπ¬†Portuguese, üá∑üá∫¬†Russian, üá®üá≥¬†Chinese, üáØüáµ¬†Japanese, üáÆüá©¬†Indonesian, üá∞üá∑¬†Korean, üáπüá≠¬†Thai, üáπüá∑¬†Turkish, üáøüá¶¬†Zulu.

**Other IRL Products/Events**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu pendants and recently Kendu Beer.  
Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  
Kendu is a head sponsor at Miami Music Week. StaySeaArt, Inkstradamus and NoSleep305 have played a significant role in this. The group are giving out lots of Kendu Energy(yes we have energy drinks, more will be mentioned later in the post), they have created a Kendu Energy cocktail menu and are giving out merch. These are certified Kendu Legends!!! Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.

Kendu Celt and Kendu GNX have teamed up and created a board game called ""Kendu Conquest"", I will provide the rules below, so you can work it out for yourself.

**A Few Interesting Idea**

Shib, Doge and Pepe have shown what sort of potential organic memecoins have, it shows that there is no ceiling for growth. The fact that Shib went from 22 million market cap to 22 billion in 36 days. Yes you read that right..... 36 days. Kendu has been recognised by mutliple crypto OGs. These people all see the potential in Kendu, we are creating a recipe to take over both IRL and social media. Kendu is the Shib 2021 opportunity, all the signs are there, Shib was at a similar MC at this point in the cycle(this cycle seems to be more delayed compared to 2021). Kendu is focused on running it up the same way the other MemeCoin Hall of Famers have done in the past. Kendu is unstoppable and we continue working in this market!!!

In terms of social media presence, Kendu has the potential to take over levels peak Shiba Inu had reached in 2021.  
Kendu can easily 1453x this year at the time of writing this post. In my opinion we can 3000x but I am a dreamer lol.

I advise you to join our telegram or our subreddit, but our tg is far busier. Even if you don't hold a bag join us and check us out. Ask any questions you want, we are a very welcoming community : )  
Skip the Papa Johns and put the money into Kendu $15 can easily become $15000.

It is your choice Anon, this is your opportunity to join a community destined to cement it's legacy in crypto history. Join the winning team, we are $KENDU.

We Don't Gamble, We Work!!!

When there is no other chance, I at least want to remove that part, where my personal data etc. is on, so I could sell/gift it for the other parts and declare it as broken.
If there is someone out there, who could try to teach my how to do or have any other recommandations, it‚Äôd be a pleasure for me.

* Walking 15K per day (if I do not walk 15K per day then it over runs to the next day) 
* Eating would be cutting off (Bread, rice, sugar) --> Mainly low carb but eating boiled potatoes, chickpeas, vegetables and fruits is OK (Fruits I will be cutting off though are Banana and Dates since I tend to binge on them
* No keto alternatives as they keep me in the zone of wanting bread or sugar --> Honey is the only thing allowed with say greek yoghurt and fruits 
* Feasting days (No time limit - ideally 12 h but if I break my fast later that's also O.K or if I eat later that's also O.K)

I sort of turned away to not draw the dogs attention as I was in my nice work clothes and I also just hate when dogs jump on me, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cute and I don‚Äôt appreciate it. 

Anyway, as they got maybe a couple meters away, the dog was still acting like it was going to jump on my so I said ‚Äúexcuse me, could you please keep your dog from jumping on me?‚Äù And she just said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a dog, it‚Äôs what they do‚Äù while rolling her eyes at me and continuing to walk past. Of course, the dog jumped on me while I was drinking my coffee which ended up spilling on my white work shirt and left a big dirty scratch mark on my work pants that I just bought a few days prior. 

Here‚Äôs where I may be an asshole, I got up dripping in coffee and yelled ‚Äúhey! I told you to keep your damn dog off me, maybe if you can‚Äôt control the stupid thing you should get rid of it‚Äù the woman apologised saying the dog was abused like 10 years ago so he doesn‚Äôt know many social cues and I shouldn‚Äôt be so sensitive. 

I told her she needed to reimburse me for my shirt because I‚Äôd just bought it for my new job a week ago ($63) and she said no and just walked off crying. 

My coworker told me I should‚Äôve just let it be instead of causing a scene and upsetting the ‚Äúpoor dog and his mummy‚Äù (I didn‚Äôt yell at the dog, just gave it an angry look I guess) and lectured me about how other people‚Äôs feelings are important too and not everything is about me. 

I personally don‚Äôt feel bad about it but I also feel like maybe she‚Äôs right and I overreacted. 

TLDR; told dog owner to prevent dog from jumping on me, she did not, I yelled at her, coworker thinks I‚Äôm an asshole.

Context:

After talking to this awesome girl for about 2 months on Hinge, we started going out and now have been on 5 dates, with another tonight! First two dates we got some coffees and hung out at the cafe for 4-7 hours, it was fun she‚Äôs great! The last three times we‚Äôve hung out it‚Äôs been at one of our places and we typically end up talking-watching something-hooking up-talk all night. Our conversations seem to be getting more intimate and vulnerable, also since our first date we have hung out every weekend since consistently. honestly I REALLY dig her and she seems/says that she really like me too.

Do you just assume after X-amount of time together you‚Äôre dating?

Like are we ‚Äúdating‚Äù as we‚Äôre going on dates? But does dating=relationship ?? I guess ultimately the question is how do you distinguish whether or not you‚Äôre just hooking up or actually seriously seeing each other ? In modern dating, is it normal/expected to explicitly ask ‚Äúdo you want to be in a relationship?‚Äù or do you just assume after a certain amount of time of hanging together that your ‚Äútogether‚Äù? If explicitly asking is the best approach, what‚Äôs the best way to ask without sounding corny/awkwardly cheesey? 
 
**TL;DR**: Is it important to explicitly ask someone that you‚Äôre seeing if they want to be in a relationship, or do you just assume that you are after X-time? If asking, what‚Äôs the best approach?

1jh6hpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/PetPeeves/comments/1jh6hpv/morning_people/,Morning People,"Before I worked nights, I never minded morning people. I never minded people period. Never loved people, or never was a morning person myself, but I didn't mind people who were. Since I started working nights at my hotel, I DESPISE morning people. On top of that, my raging baby fever has metamorphosed into a full on dread and disdain towards motherhood, but that's a whole different story. 

I got accustomed to the silence that came along with working nights. I started working 10pm to 6 am. Free time, peace, and no one here to boss me around. Over time, I came to dread the sound of footsteps, suitcase wheels or guests talking. The phone and the bell have us conditioned like Pavlov's dog in the worst way possible. With each sound comes a tight chest, increased heart rate, and inexplicable rage. Little did I know I had it pretty easy until I had to work the breakfast rush. 

About two months into my employment as a night auditor, my boss asked me if I wanted to come in at 11 and leave at 7 from now on. I happily agreed, looking forward to the extra hour to sleep in. Little did I know, 6-7 am is when everyone and their mothers come out of their rooms. Personally, I wouldn't wake up for breakfast until an hour or two before it ended. These people don't think like that. They want to be up at the ass crack of dawn, sometimes waiting eagerly in the lobby for breakfast to open. I don't mean to be rude, but it's always the heavy ones. I'm not talking dad bods. I'm talking about the planet-shaped ones. 

In the last hour of my shift, I'm drained. Even if I did nothing the whole night, simply hearing guests walking and talking around me was draining enough. Having these sounds tenfold and people talk to me on top of it only drains me even more. 

The bloated, half dead ones that wait in the lobby are never silent. Never. They always cough or clear their throat a million times. You're telling me you had to come to the lobby to do that? You couldn't do that in the privacy of your hotel room? 

The main thing with morning people that absolutely boils my blood is the perky ""morning!"" ""Morning!"" They all chirp, as if it isn't 6:05 am. They can't be discreet with it either, they have to shout it from the god damn roof tops. Shut up. Shut the fuck up. It's the same shit every god damn day. If you're going to be out and about this early, the least you could do is be quiet. My favorite types of morning guests are the ones who give me a polite smile or nod, or the ones that are too tired to say anything at all. I just smile and wave and go about my day.  

Half the time, the ones waiting in the lobby were in the same spot the night before, drinking themselves into oblivion. These same people are the ones who let their children just run around the hotel. They don't care what those kids do as long as mommy and daddy can drink in peace. These people alone have transformed me from a girl who is desperate to have children ASAP to a woman who lowkey hopes she's infertile. Maybe I'll change my mind once I'm closer to 30, but as of now, no way. I hate children. 

Nonetheless, the whole family is up and at em at 5:30 am. When they're loud in my lobby the night before, I always give them decaf coffee. Maybe that will teach them to go the fuck to bed.

I hate waking up this late in the day, for the daylight to be gone so soon. In the winter I would almost live in darkness due to the sun being gone so soon. I used to sleep around 2AM normally and wake up at 10-12 which was consistent for a while. 

I have trouble getting tired and falling asleep (sometimes will lay in bed for 1-2hrs doing nothing) so I will stay on my phone reading until I fall asleep which sometimes my book can keep me up longer, other times not.

My current solution to this is not sleeping one night then trying to sleep earlier the next, but as you can read its my third time in about a month and a half so its not working too well.

I have tried cutting out as much coffee from my day as I know that it results in poor sleep, and I try to exercise before I sleep as well to make myself tired. I try to take vitamin D supplements as well because I don‚Äôt go outside often enough. I even stopped taking my dosage of Concerta as I believed it was making me stay up longer.

I don‚Äôt know a healthy solution to changing my sleep schedule without being drastic like I am. I can‚Äôt force myself to sleep earlier but I‚Äôve thought that may be from not pushing myself enough daily. Even when I wake up, I lay in bed for 30mins - 2 hours because I feel so lethargic and even will fall back asleep.

I believe my mental health is deteriorating and it‚Äôs worrying me greatly, and I feel like fixing my sleep schedule will be a big help with getting myself back on track.

If you have any advice to give or words to say, they would be greatly appreciated.",1,1742643127.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

I am unfortunately new to all of this.

Does this include every kind of tea or just black and green tea?

I found a nice bike on sale that meets all my specs at a reasonable price. 

It‚Äôs a specialized rockhopper expert with 29‚Äù wheels for $899 in my local bike shop. 

The only thing that concerns me is that it has quick release rather than thru axles. 

Is this going to be an issue long term? 

I plan to use the bike mainly for local trails around Arizona (nothing too crazy, very basic downhill, but quite rocky at times), and occasional 1-2 night bikepacking trips in Arizona and Utah deserts and gravel roads. 

Is it a bad idea to buy a bike with quick release? I haven‚Äôt purchased a new bike in a decade, and that one got stolen a couple of years back. I started talking to some guys at a bike-centric coffee shop, and they said stay away from Rockhoppers because they are outdated (but they were also telling me to get a Trek Roscoe for my purposes, but I think they had some business connection with Trek).

1jh6d2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jh6d2o/jords_troubled_life_chapter_three/,Jord's troubled life | Chapter Three,"Jord peeled the last potato, fingers pruned and raw. Hesk tossed him a rag. ‚ÄòCheers for the company. If you‚Äôre hungry, there‚Äôs slop in the fridge. If not, piss off ‚Äì shift‚Äôs over.‚Äô

By the time Jord left the barracks, the drizzle had ceased, the street-lights casting flickering lights on the cobblestones. He trudged home, shoulders slumped under fatigue‚Äôs weight.

The house lay dark. No leftovers waited on the counter. No folded laundry. His room, usually tidied by Elia, remained as he‚Äôd left it: clothes strewn, bed unmade. Jord set his alarm for 6:00 a.m., boots discarded beside the bed, and slept.

‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì

The alarm blared. Jord grabbed a coffee ‚Äì sludge-black and sour, he‚Äôd forgotten to buy sugar again ‚Äì and staggered to the shower. The boiler shuddered to life, groaned, then died mid-lather.

‚ÄòFuck‚Äôs sake!‚Äô He hammered the valve. ‚ÄòElias! Boiler‚Äôs gone!‚Äô

‚ÄòAgain?‚Äô Elias‚Äôs voice drifted from the kitchen, edged with sarcasm. ‚ÄòShockin‚Äô. Maybe if you hadn‚Äôt tried to fix it last month with a butter k‚Äì‚Äô

‚ÄòJust restart it!‚Äô

‚ÄòWith what? Your charisma?‚Äô

Elia stomped to the boiler, jiggled the fuse box, and slammed it with his palm twice for good measure. The pipes clanked, sputtering lukewarm water for three seconds before dying.

Jord scoffed. ‚ÄòBrilliant.‚Äô

‚ÄòYou want it fixed? Pay a technician.‚Äô

‚ÄòWith what? Past vainglories?‚Äô

Elias shrugged behind the door. Jord endured the bitter cold, scrubbing mechanically under the freezing onslaught. He emerged shivering, towel clutched to his chest. Elia leaned in the hallway, arms crossed.

‚ÄòSo? What happened? Yet to steal a child‚Äôs treat?‚Äô

‚ÄòNah. Signed a lot of forms, and I mean a lot. So far, doesn‚Äôt seem that bad. Probably will get training ‚Äì paired with other newbies, or maybe mock patrol? Still, no uniforms or badges, or anything official. Clerk‚Äôs had a hard-on for procedures and got nothin‚Äô ‚Äòtill orientation. Manual‚Äôs not even downloaded.‚Äô Jord raked a hand through his damp hair. ‚ÄòWant a copy?‚Äô

Elias released a breath, posture loosening. ‚ÄòSure. But isn‚Äôt that against the rules?‚Äô

Jord stared at him, deadpan. ‚ÄòDunno.‚Äô

‚ÄòHuh. Well, if you can ‚Äì why not?‚Äô Elias turned toward his room. ‚ÄòJust don‚Äôt sign anything that sells your soul.‚Äô

Jord snorted. ‚ÄòWouldn‚Äôt recognise it if I did.‚Äô

Elia left Jord alone in the hallway. Jord then changed and left the house. His parents bid him a half-hearted farewell, too engrossed in their gossip to look up.

‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì

The morning air clung thick with diesel fumes and the metallic tang of distant factories. Jord walked ‚Äì past bus stops slumped in disrepair, past the morning traffic ‚Äì until the compound‚Äôs outer fence loomed ahead, barbed wire snarling against a grey sky.

A checkpoint guard, not the same man as yesterday, squinted at Jord, then jabbed a thumb toward a side gate. ‚ÄòNew recruits queue at the east kiosk.‚Äô

Jord flashed Mara‚Äôs message on his phone, its screen glowing:

PROCEED TO TRACK 3 VIA SOUTH GATE.  ‚Äì OFFICER MARA V.

The guard approached, read the message, and satisfied, waved him through.

The compound sprawled west of the grey edifice ‚Äì a sprawling, utilitarian expanse of cracked concrete and rusted fencing. Open-air shooting ranges pockmarked the northern edge, their bullet-riddled targets swaying in the wind, while crumbling racing tracks coiled like neglected scars across the southern quadrant.

Jord lingered at the perimeter. His gaze snagging on a cluster of figures in unmarked fatigues drilling near the armoury. They moved with a silent, lethal precision that clashed with what Jord recalled what the Guard were able to do.

‚ÄòWho‚Äôre they?‚Äô Jord muttered to a passing officer, nodding toward the figures in unmarked fatigues.

The officer adjusted his cap, gaze sliding past Jord as if he were air. His boots crunched gravel, pace unbroken, until he vanished into a prefab hut.

Jord stared after the officer, jaw tightening. Around him, the compound thrummed ‚Äì helicopters droning, recruits barking drills ‚Äì but his question hung unanswered. Arsehole, he thought, and marched towards Track 3, the grey edifice‚Äôs shadow enveloping him.

He checked his phone ‚Äì 07:43. Still early. The track stretched empty.. No rookies, no officers, not even a stray dog. So they‚Äôve reserved the entire field for us? Or are they so much understaffed? The thought curdled into a scoff.

He glanced at his phone again, checking again Mara‚Äôs earlier message:

AWAIT OFFICER JORY AT TRACK 3. HE WILL SHEPHERD YOUR GROUP.

No explanation, no timeline. Jord scowled. Shepherd. As if they were sheep to be corralled, not recruits.

He sought shelter from the chill air, slumping against a fence post. The sun-warmed metal seeped heat into his back as his phone buzzed again ‚Äì another notification.

DELAYED. OFFICER JORY WILL ARRIVE 09:15. TERMINAL MALFUNCTION.

Jord‚Äôs irritation flared, then died ‚Äì what was the point? The Guard‚Äôs organizational ineptitude was being proven as reliable as the boiler back home.

Time oozed past. Jord thumbed his phone, then shoved it away ‚Äì better to avoid looking unprofessional. He stretched, joints cracking, and surveyed the grounds: frost-stiffened grass, a weathered wooden hurdle slumped mid-track. On impulse, he broke into a sprint. His lungs burned instantly, legs leaden, but when he reached the hurdle, he hauled himself over with a grunt ‚Äì clumsy but decisive. There it was. Years of hauling crates had forged raw, utilitarian strength, not the lithe endurance he necessitated.

Hope they don‚Äôt make us run all day. I‚Äôll either faint or puke. Don‚Äôt wanna make that bad of a impression ‚Äì not before the first payslip at least. Jord paced the track, worry gnawing at him. To kill time, he walked a lap, then jogged another, sweat pricking his neck despite the cold. The rhythm of his footsteps ‚Äì crunching gravel, laboured breaths ‚Äì eased the tension in his shoulders, if only slightly.

By his third lap, a man approached. Short, wiry, with hair the colour of stale tea and a uniform frayed at the cuffs. He stood at the track‚Äôs edge, arms crossed, watching Jord with a smirk that bordered on pity.

‚ÄòWhittaker?‚Äô The man‚Äôs voice was gravelly, like he‚Äôd smoked his way through a decade of bureaucracy. ‚ÄòJory‚Äôs stuck in a terminal blackout. You‚Äôre with me now. Let‚Äôs see if you can climb a wall without crying.‚Äô

Jord stopped mid-stride and approached the man. ‚ÄòSorry, sir. You are?‚Äô he asked, squinting at the stranger‚Äôs bare collar.

‚ÄòJory‚Äôs partner‚Äì‚Äô The man thrust a thumb at his chest, ‚Äò ‚Äì Name‚Äôs Lapo. Now clench your trap and follow.‚Äô He strode toward the obstacle course ‚Äì a mess of frayed ropes and sun-bleached walls ‚Äì without glancing back.

At the base of a timber wall, Lapo jerked his chin upward. ‚ÄòClimb over. Twice. Most can‚Äôt.‚Äô

Jord eyed the splintered wood, then gripped the ledge. His shoulders burned on the first haul, palms raw by the second. He dropped to the dirt, breath ragged.

Lapo stated simply, ‚ÄòFunctional. Not elegant.‚Äô Then he began to pace slowly as he continued:

‚ÄòI‚Äôve seen you running ‚Äì your form is good, but could be better. Your endurance is shit, but that‚Äôs life for you.‚Äô He halted, jabbing a finger at Jord‚Äôs face. ‚ÄòWorse yet, You don‚Äôt hold a man‚Äôs gaze. That‚Äôs weak. You need to loom. Be solid, Whittaker. Like a brick wall. If someone runs into you, they don‚Äôt get back up ‚Äì they spit out teeth and regret their choices because most of Guard‚Äôs duty is theatre ‚Äì look solid, project professionalism. And if you can‚Äôt?‚Äô He shrugged. ‚ÄòBeg help from your collogues, it doesn‚Äôt make you weak.‚Äô

Jord‚Äôs posture stiffened, his tone icy. ‚ÄòWhat do you suggest I do?‚Äô

Lapo leaned closer. ‚ÄòHard to say. Don‚Äôt know yet if you‚Äôre meek or just pretending to be. Either way ‚Äì‚Äô He stepped closer ‚Äì making Jord uncomfortable ‚Äì and lowered his voice. ‚ÄòGrow a spine. Fake it. Build a mask. Don‚Äôt care how, but if you can‚Äôt?‚Äô He jabbed a finger at Jord‚Äôs chest. ‚ÄòThe job will grind you into paste. You‚Äôll be the doormat everyone wipes their boots on.‚Äô

‚ÄòEven this,‚Äô Lapo continued, circling a finger between them, ‚Äòthe closeness ‚Äì it makes you twitchy, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äô

Jord said nothing but nodded. Lapo took three deliberate steps back; the tension eased, but Jord‚Äôs shoulders stayed rigid.

‚ÄòI don‚Äôt understand,‚Äô Jord said. ‚ÄòIsn‚Äôt this a bit‚Ä¶ too much? Threatening people ‚Äì isn‚Äôt the job to guard, not‚Ä¶ not play these macabre mind games?‚Äô

Lapo barked a laugh. ‚ÄòI prefer to teach excellence. But if you‚Äôd rather swim in a sea of mediocrity, accommodate yourself. Be my guest.‚Äô He spat into the dirt. ‚ÄòAnd don‚Äôt kid yourself ‚Äì merit‚Äôs a myth. Half my call-outs are because some rookie didn‚Äôt know how to glare at a drunk.‚Äô

‚ÄòAren't you deliberately offloading your work onto me then?‚Äô Jord said, crossing his arms.

‚ÄòYes, what are you going to do about it?‚Äô Lapo sneered. ‚ÄòWhine some more? Mark my words, boy. Those who don‚Äôt bend break. Be a sponge, absorb everything and you will go far.‚Äô

‚ÄòSo,‚Äô Jord said, crossing his arms, ‚Äòyou‚Äôll make me a training schedule? Follow me around? Dictate what I eat?‚Äô

‚ÄòGods, no.‚Äô Lapo‚Äôs grin was razor-thin. ‚ÄòI‚Äôll give you a list. Fail to meet it, and I‚Äôll double it. Fail again, and I‚Äôll see you discharged for incompetence.‚Äô He leaned in, close enough that Jord could count the flecks of grey in his stubble. ‚ÄòBut ‚Äì ‚Äô a pause, deliberate ‚Äò ‚Äì stick to my regime and I‚Äôll vouch for you with the old guard. Better pay. Better postings. Respect.‚Äô

The word lingered, heavy as a gauntlet thrown at Jord‚Äôs feet

Then why are you here? Jord thought, but biting that off was wiser than inviting another tongue-lashing.

Lapo, nonplussed, continued. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre slow, you‚Äôre sloppy, and you‚Äôre about as sturdy as wet cardboard. That changes now.‚Äô He checked his watch, then flicked his gaze back to Jord. ‚ÄòEvery morning, 8 kilometres. Full gear. You don‚Äôt hit the mark? You start crawling. No shortcuts.‚Äô

‚ÄòLet‚Äôs start.‚Äô Lapo said, already breaking into a jog.

Jord had barely made it past 3 kilometres before his legs turned to stone, breath ragged, sweat burning his eyes. He‚Äôd slowed to a miserable trudge, boots dragging through track. Lapo didn‚Äôt call for a stop. He simply jogged past, unfazed, and barked, ‚ÄòPick it up, or we‚Äôre doing this all day.‚Äô

Spitting and gasping for air, Jord finally made it, though not entirely by running. Along the way, the thought of begging crossed his mind, but he resisted the temptation.

Lapo gestured to Jord‚Äôs resting position with a look of pure boredom, as if the run hadn‚Äôt drained his strength in the slightest. ‚ÄòNow, combat drills, twice a day. Mornings, striking ‚Äì precision over power. You‚Äôll train until your muscles memorise the angles. Evenings, grappling. If you can‚Äôt break a hold or slip a tackle, you‚Äôre useless. Follow me.‚Äô

Lapo demonstrated the basic stances, but then made Jord strike a worn-out sandbag. Jord‚Äôs fists throbbed, knuckles raw from the relentless hits. His shoulders screamed with every movement, his form slipping as his punches grew slower and sloppier. When Lapo, with a casual shove, sent him sprawling, Jord barely managed to catch himself before crashing face-first into the ground.

Lapo nudged a steel balance beam with his boot. ‚ÄòFootwork‚Äôs a joke. That ends today. You‚Äôll stand on this beam till your legs stop shaking. Stability drills ‚Äì stairs, gravel, wet surfaces, you name it. A fighter who can‚Äôt stand isn‚Äôt a fighter, he‚Äôs a target. Fastest way to deny an opponent their advantage,‚Äô Lapo said coldly, ‚Äòis by making them fall.‚Äô

Jord climbed onto the beam, knees locked stiff, arms flailing as he tried to balance. His boots wobbled on the rusted metal, every moment perilous. Halfway a minute, his ankle buckled, and he hit the ground hard. Lapo sighed. ‚ÄòPathetic. Again.‚Äô

Jord repeated the exercise over and over, his body screaming in protest, until, at last, he reached a full minute mark.

‚ÄòCongratulations.‚Äô A slow, knowing smirk plastered on Lapo‚Äôs face. ‚ÄòNow, strength training ‚Äì callisthenics, mostly. Weighted carries, sledgehammer swings, resistance work. You‚Äôll lift till your arms shake, then you‚Äôll lift some more. You will be faster, stronger, and meaner by the time I‚Äôm done with you.‚Äô

Jord‚Äôs first swing shattered the stillness ‚Äì a clumsy arc that sent the sledgehammer‚Äôs head thudding into the tractor tyre. Lapo watched, arms folded, as Jord repeated the motion: heave, pivot, strike. By the fifteenth rep, he heaved for breath. By the twentieth, his strength started failing him. ‚ÄòFaster,‚Äô Lapo barked. ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not dead yet.‚Äô

Jord‚Äôs arms locked mid-swing, grip slack, the sledgehammer slipped from his grip to crash into the rubber ball. It bounced wildly, skittering through the dirt. He bent double, hands on his knees, breath sawing in and out as sweat dripped onto the parched ground. His vision blurred at the edges.

Lapo crouched beside him, his voice low, mocking. 'Is that all you‚Äôve got?'

He stood, arms crossed, his shadow sharp against the sun-baked earth. 'Stick to this, and you won‚Äôt just survive. You‚Äôll own every room you walk into.'

Jord looked up, hands trembling. The road ahead stretched endless, shimmering like heat haze. Lapo‚Äôs gaze offered no choice ‚Äì only forward or failure.

‚ÄòSomething to drink‚Ä¶ please?‚Äô Jord begged.

‚ÄòSure.‚Äô Lapo tossed him a water bottle ‚Äì Jord hadn‚Äôt even noticed when Lapo got himself a backpack.

Jord reached for it, but his limbs felt like lead. The bottle thudded to the ground. Seriously? He glared at Lapo, then dragged himself to it and gulped it dry.

‚ÄòHow much longer till the others get here? We‚Äôve been here for ‚Äì ‚Äô He checked his phone. ‚Äò ‚Äì hours.‚Äô

Lapo snorted. ‚ÄòTime naps when we‚Äôre having fun, eh? As for the others ‚Äì ‚Äô He jerked a thumb toward the northern track. ‚ÄòJory‚Äôs herding them there. We‚Äôre walking.‚Äô

They walked ‚Äì though walked felt too generous for the leaden trudge Jord endured. His heart battered his ribs, vision tunnelling to a greyish blur. By the time they reached the track, the journey had dissolved into fragments ‚Äì a stumble over gravel, Lapo‚Äôs barked commands, the metallic tang of gastric reflux in his throat.

The track teemed with figures. His group, he assumed. Six of them, hunched and sweat-soaked, their postures mirroring his own exhaustion.

Jord squinted at the group in the distance, his breath still ragged. ‚ÄòThat them?‚Äô he muttered.

‚ÄòUnless you‚Äôve got another sorry lot wandering around,‚Äô Lapo said dryly.

Jord exhaled sharply, trying to shake the numbness from his legs. ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt even‚Äì‚Äò He rasped for breath, ‚Äò‚Äìknow if I can keep down breakfast.‚Äô Lapo didn‚Äôt care for that for He slapped Jord‚Äôs shoulder ‚Äì not hard, but enough to make his already burning muscles protest. ‚ÄòGet used to it.‚Äô

Jord shot him a look, then nodded toward the others. ‚ÄòWhat are they doing?‚Äô

‚ÄòWaiting.‚Äô Lapo stretched, rolling his shoulders. ‚ÄòJory‚Äôs been running them through warm-ups, but now that you‚Äôre here, we can really start.‚Äô

Jord groaned, rubbing his face. ‚ÄòFantastic.‚Äô

Lapo clapped his hands together, his grin all teeth. ‚ÄòGood. Now go tell them what you learned so far.‚Äô

Jord blinked. ‚ÄòLearned what? I‚Äôm barely surviving.‚Äô

Lapo shrugged. ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt we all? Be honest, and tell them that.‚Äô

Jord finally reached the group. He wasn‚Äôt the tallest, nor the leanest, and certainly not the most striking.

‚ÄòThis‚Äì‚Äô An officer by the collar‚Äôs emblem (Jory, he assumed, squinting through his haze) jabbed a finger at him, ‚Äò‚Äìis your new colleague. Partner, if he lasts the week. Seems that Lapo already inducted you in the life. So, how do you feel in so far?‚Äô

Jord glanced around. A woman watched him with pity, a man with quiet worry in his eyes, and two others who seemed indifferent, focused on their own business. None of them concerned him.

What did was the small man standing apart from the rest ‚Äì lean, sharp-featured, glasses perched on his nose, a short crop of hair neat and controlled. He wasn‚Äôt just looking at Jord ‚Äì he was staring, gaze heavy with something unreadable, something bordering on menace.

Jord didn‚Äôt know why, but he made a mental note of the guy. Maybe it was nothing. Maybe he was imagining it. But better safe than sorry. He‚Äôd watch his back, especially if he ever got partnered with him.

‚ÄòMy name is Jord Whittaker, and as Officer Jory mentioned, I‚Äôm your new colleague. Pleased to make your acquaintance.‚Äô Better to start on the right foot. Stay on their good side.

Jory snorted. ‚ÄòHmph, yeah. Let me guess ‚Äì Lapo already ran you into the ground? Take it easy for now. You can join us when you‚Äôve got your legs back under you. No point in barfing first thing in the morning, right?‚Äô He glanced at one of the indifferent men from before, a tall, broad-shouldered guy with a heavy build and a shock of crimson hair.

‚ÄòAs I said earlier,‚Äô Jory continued, addressing the group, ‚Äòyour role is more about presence than action. The fastest way to do the job is to act decisively, not get bogged down in nonsense.‚Äô

Jord crossed his arms and nodded.

Jory continued, ‚ÄòAlright, let‚Äôs go over a few situations. First one ‚Äì a drunk starts a brawl. What do you do?‚Äô

One of them, a wiry man with a sharp look, spoke up. ‚ÄòIf we go by the manual, we de-escalate, escort the suspect to jail to cool off, then fine him for public nuisance.‚Äô

‚ÄòOfficially, yes,‚Äô Jory said, then let out a dry chuckle. ‚ÄòIn reality? Toss him in the street and call it a day. Don‚Äôt waste time arguing with fools ‚Äì just use force when needed. And if you ever find yourself wondering whether violence is the answer, you‚Äôre asking the wrong question. The real question is violence and the answer is yes.‚Äô Jory spoke in a tone that left no room for disagreement.

The group dispersed into pairs, tasked with simulating a pub brawl under Jory‚Äôs watch. Jord was paired with the sharp-featured man in glasses, whose nameplate read V. Krane. Up close, Krane‚Äôs gaze felt surgical, dissecting Jord‚Äôs every twitch.

‚ÄòRules?‚Äô Jord asked, rolling his stiff shoulders.

'No rules,‚Äô Jory called out. 'Just results.‚Äô

Krane struck first ‚Äì a jab precise as a needle. Jord staggered, lip split. Heave, pivot, strike. Lapo‚Äôs voice snarled in his memory. Jord swung wildly, missing Krane entirely but slamming his fist into open air.

'Pathetic,‚Äô Krane muttered, adjusting his glasses. 'You hit like a dockworker.‚Äô

I am a dockworker, Jord thought, but lunged again, this time grappling Krane‚Äôs waist. They crashed into the dirt, Jord‚Äôs raw knuckles grinding gravel as Krane twisted free.

'Enough!‚Äô Jory barked. 'Whittaker ‚Äì you‚Äôre dead. Krane ‚Äì you win.‚Äô

Jord lay panting, soiled and humiliated, as Krane strode off, pristine save for a smudge on his sleeve. The woman who‚Äôd watched him earlier tossed Jord a rag. 'You‚Äôll learn,‚Äô she said, not unkindly.

At dusk, Jord limped past the special forces vacant training ground. A balaclava lay trampled in the mud ‚Äì black, unmarked. He pocketed it, a relic of the elite he‚Äôd only hear in whispers.

Lapo materialized beside the fence, smirking. 'Still standing?‚Äô

'Barely.‚Äô

'Good. Means you‚Äôre able to bend.‚Äô Lapo tossed him a protein bar. 'Good work today. And keep that mask tight, Whittaker. It‚Äôs starting to fit.‚Äô

Jord bit into the bar. Ahead, Krane lingered at the compound gates, staring. Jord met his gaze until Krane looked away.

Small victories. They‚Äôd have to do.

However, it only works for characters that have been scanned before on my website. It does update when a new character is scanned, though.

It might not be extremely useful but I like seeing what I've collected in the past and I thought some of you as well.   üôÇ

Enjoy!

Really don‚Äôt know if I should try to pursue or not. On one hand, I kind of like having this crush. I know what it means to have a crush‚Äîit‚Äôs projecting your own fantasies onto someone and seeing them as an almost perfect human being. And honestly, I don‚Äôt mind continuing to do that until the feeling naturally fades. Realistically, I don‚Äôt even think we‚Äôd be a good match. We seem to come from two completely different worlds.

He started coming to the bakery regularly since his new job was nearby, and we‚Äôd chat now and then. It was nice seeing him again.

- Coffee was brewed with an Origami, Cafec Abaca filters.

- Custom Lotus Water recipe which has about 55 ppm.

- 93c / 199f water temp

- Ground on Ode Gen 2, dial set on 7.

- Coffea Ciculor recipe was used, 3 equal pours of 100 ml, spaced 1 minute apart. 3.15 total drawdown time.

Tasted like Strawberry, very floral, a little bit of rhubarb. As it cooled down you got peachy/apricot notes

Interestingly, the aftertaste was very.. buttered popcorn-like. This is probably due to it being a very light roast, and me resting the coffee for 'only' a week or so. I couldn't wait to crack it open and taste as it rested more. The aftertaste actually added some depth to the coffee instead of detracting from it.

Overall, highly recommended, both this particular coffee and the roaster in general!

1jh67bn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jh67bn,Spritz by Typsy: Cafe Noir and Vanilla Whispers‚Äî My review! ‚òïÔ∏èüßÅ,"So, I got my hands on Spritz by Typsy beauty‚Äôs Caf√© Noir and Vanilla Whispers, and I have some thoughts. If u have been eyeing these, here is a breakdown of how they smell and what they remind me of! Notes of both the perfumes are added in the images!

1. Caf√© Noir ‚òï‚ú®

* AM Side: The base and heart notes give me major Maison Margiela Replica Coffee Break vibes. It has that creamy, coffee accord but isn‚Äôt too bitter or burnt.

* PM Side: I can‚Äôt quite pinpoint what this reminds me of yet, but it‚Äôs richer and darker than the AM. If you like deep, cozy coffee fragrances with a twist, this might be worth checking out.

üî• Zodiac Vibes: 

SCORPIO ‚ôè & CAPRICORN ‚ôë ‚Äì Mysterious, bold, and sophisticated. Caf√© Noir is for those who like to leave a lasting impression.


2. Vanilla Whispers üç¶üíï

* Overall Vibe: This reminds me of Kayali Vanilla 28 mixed with Candy Rock Sugar. Not an exact dupe, but it leans in that direction.

* AM Side: Lighter, fresher, and lacks the patchouli that‚Äôs present in the PM version. It‚Äôs more wearable for daytime.

* PM Side: Much denser and richer but still follows a similar scent profile. If you love deep, sugary vanillas, the PM version will be your favorite.

üíñ Zodiac Vibes: 

TAURUS ‚ôâ & PISCES ‚ôì ‚Äì Sweet, dreamy, and comforting, like a warm hug in a bottle.

üï∞Ô∏è Longevity & Performance ‚è≥

The brand markets these as extrait de parfum, but on my skin, they performed more like an Eau de Parfum (EDP). I got around 4ish hours on skin and 6-8 hours on clothes, which is pretty standard for most EDPs (imo). It could just be my skin chemistry, but don‚Äôt expect beast-mode longevity.

* Projection-wise, they start off strong but settle closer to the skin after 2-3 hours. If you want a strong scent bubble, you might need to reapply.

* ‚ú® Worth noting: I live in a hot and humid climate, which can affect how a fragrance performs, so your experience may vary!

üí∞ Price & Value üí∏

These are priced at ‚Çπ2,200 for 50ml (25ml per side), which isn't bad per se. However, at this price point, you can easily get 100ml of Middle Eastern perfumes that perform the same, if not better. That said, I don‚Äôt think these are bad at all, just something to keep in mind if u r comparing options.
Overall, both of these feel nice, but if u r  expecting 1:1 dupes for any designer scents, they r not quite that (the brand also doesn‚Äôt claim that anywhere). They do, however, have familiar vibes that might appeal to fans of the perfumes I mentioned (to my nose, u can have a different opinion for the same).

More proof that Loblaw price fluctuations are not caused by suppliers.","If suppliers are normally required to submit price change notifications 12 weeks (~3 months) in advance, and they are normally not allowed to make price adjustments during the holidays, it is ridiculous that Loblaw still claims these frequent retal price changes are driven by suppliers.

1jh62ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1jh62ax/bad_review_wishing_the_entire_small_business_ill/,Bad review wishing the entire small business ill hating our beans,"I just saw the cafe I work at got a bad review.  Now it had me in the first half because the customer complained off the barista that day not answering her questions about allergies for some vegan alternative. I totally respect the customers frustration and personally I would have checked the ingredientlist for her.

The menu lists all the ingredients in the sandwhich but not the ingredients itself of the premade vegan patty so I understand the confustion between the barista saying it's on the menu and her trying to get across that it's not. I am very serious when it comes to customer dietary restrictions so i truly felt bad about her recieving that service.

BUT then she went off about the alternative thing that she ordered, which made it clear she as an individual is inattentive. Then she complained about the prices (all business on the entire block have high prices due to area so understandable but a little ignorant). She then made a derisive comment about hipsters will get bored and that the businesses will fail.

The part that really got me is her saying cheap beans and that she is coffee connoisseur?(doubt). Because our roaster does a good job for sure. Now since I wasn't there I cant account for factors like way too fresh beans dumped into the machine, poorly tamped, too long or short of shot etc. But one thing I can guarantee is that the beans are definitely a wonderful in between medium-dark roast with an almost chocolatey taste and is certainly rich (like i made a regular latte and someone told me they got a mocha that day but that batch was heavy on the chocolatey notes that week). 

I'm not an owner or anything, nor even a fulltime barista. I just truly enjoy the vibe at the cafe and serving drinks so while review wasnt even about me it just sucked to see how meanspirited it got. Especially the intentional wishing of failure on it. I also love supporting small businesses in general. Obviously I don't end up liking all small business products and i do get bad service occasionally but I can't imagine being a such a hater either",2,1742641688.0,barista,1,0.6,False

Is it a bad idea to buy a bike with quick release? I haven‚Äôt purchased a new bike in a decade, and that one got stolen a couple of years back.

It's a beautiful sunny day here and I woke up hangover free, had breakfast with our daughter then we walked to the market to buy a few bits and met a friend of mine for coffee. We took a nice walk back, now we're collecting veggies from the garden to take to my MIL, then our daughter has a swimming lesson after lunch and I'll relax in the spa area while she is with the teacher.

I also had the honor of working with Mantegna,so yes I‚Äôm partial.Okay,the elephant in the room,Culkin.My wife is a huge fan,main reason I got the tickets.We even made sure we watched ‚ÄúA real pain‚Äù a few days before we went to see the show.
I‚Äôm gonna catch a lot of shot for this.
But something stuck with me,during the show,and after the show.Kieran is truly a gifted actor,but,his miscast for this role,hear me out.
Sales,I know these people,you know these people,we‚Äôve met and dealt with these salespeople in our lives.Pacino,Mantegna,they have the finesse,the over confidence,the true belief in themselves to the core,of who this guy is.Kieran can act this role extremely well,I don‚Äôt believe him,everyone else,even the actors in the play who aren‚Äôt as talented,fit their roles better.When Bill goes off on Culkin,in the play,it really shows.Sometimes actors can‚Äôt fake the age,the layers,the grit,the part calls for.
Especially in a play.You can get away with it more in a film,or television show.But not here.
It doesn‚Äôt take away the fact that I was completely entertained and loved the production.But,when you see it,you‚Äôll know exactly what I‚Äôm talking about.
It was odd they were selling T-shirts that said Coffee for Closers.Never a line in the play,only the movie,just like the Alec Baldwin role.
Bill Burr,crush‚Äôs.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00-19.30. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

Hot-swappable reward circuits with neutral mode select, mammalian trees which have hundreds of beating hearts but no brains and whose fruits are human wombs birthing babies, and more. I came up with these ideas.","Before any of you look at the Claude link and are like whaa... hold your horses and click the link and I will show you the sheer raw firepower of human inventiveness a sleepless mentally ill 28 year old me can bring to the table.



I've got the cred to be taken seriously.



I have previously worked for multiple Fortune 500 companies in enterprise sales and that while psychiatrically half-sedated I still set a record at FedEx - they only give 1 Top Gun award per training cohort and at 25 I beat established seasoned national account executives from the likes of DHL etc who were new to FedEx and I am the first in the history of FedEx Asia Pacific operations with a perfect sales score of 100/100.



698 aircraft in the fleet ladies and gentlemen.



I made their APAC history first guy ever to get 100/100 sales score.



200,000 motorised vehicles, 500,000+ team members worldwide.



84 or so billion dollars in revenue - it's not like their recruiters are desperate to hire. they have infinite resources and oh how many billions of people living in the Asia Pacific region again? They have all the time in the world to hire the best.



Yet they hired me and I made a record. I was 25. Still half sedated poorly medicated but in that such a low pitiable state I still made an Asia Pacific level record that's the raw calibre of the guy writing this post.



At 28 I have worked for blockbuster Fortune 500 businesses each and every business any other guy would have been happy to make an entire career out of but me? ADHD. Aspergers. 6 month burnout.



Fortune 500s make me miserable.



Had I not had mental health illnesses I am very much that visionary that you all think about - I have the world class ego that could absolutely could put together the teams and build the corporation that could have changed the entire world.



I've got the special blend of personality traits and I'm close but alas it's not quite that right and so I'm out on the sidelines. Well, at least let me share my ideas it's the least I can do.



Yes I am defensive and worked up the only thing that's gonna give any sort of surety to you guys from seeing a Claude link and just making that initial microsecond stereotype of 'oh-an-ai-prolly-wrote-it' is literally me saying firmly and decisively and fucking doubling down on it that HALT üõë



That raw aggressiveness - this is a human written thing it is emotion and I can deliver and will deliver it in spades because it needs to be done here for the time being wherever AI is involved. It's what seperates us.



It's important I get worked up about it before y'all jump to conclusions - in my case it's a human brain driving the narrative with the ideas, the AI fucking listens because I'm not getting sleep and I've no one to talk to.



Basic trust in human visionaries has been corroded - well, here's your chance. Take in genuinely out-of - context brand new to the human domain level ideas that are unlike anything you've yet read.



Trees with multiple beating hearts, and more.



I'm not a scientific expert but what I am the world's most foremost expert on is... my vision for humanity. I know with clarity the broad strokes that are needed.



What irks me are the red tapes but had I my way I would very much without any qualms whatsover order off on the paperwork to get the ball rolling - humanity needs it we're being held back.



I am very much that guy who builds the teams who then look after the finer details and the research.



I have the firebrand blockbuster raw ego but unfortunately, sad to say, stuck in the limitations of my mental health, had my brain been just a bit different, have a read of what a 28 year old the calibre of a guy who could have a made a pretty big dent on the entire human civilisation.



It's a world class ego I have, but would you expect anything less of a guy who could change the whole world. I could absolutely captain us out of the cradle of mankind and no we ain't colonising fucking Mars I am anti-colonisation of other planets. What I am for is dismantling the vast riches of our solar system to build O'Neill cylinders.



We're at what 8-10 billion people now? Colonising Mars like that twat I truly hate him completely poisoned the well for this 28 year old visionary having a sleepless night.



I have selective empathy - I can cry watching a child whale swim around its recently killed mother and walk out of a movie theater (the last avatar movie) but present to me concepts sufficiently abstracted away and I could literally sign off on immense impact without feeling anything.



Fucking prick - had I a better mental health to put ideas to action and all the stars aligned it'd be a population of perhaps minimum ballpark figure 1 trillion posthumans scattered in O'Neill cylinders spanning the entire solar system such that if you ask a man living on a cylinder near Saturn just how big posthumanity is he wouldn't know because posthumanity has gotten so big.



It's such an injustice to have mental health problems. Had things been ever so slightly different just in terms of raw sheer ego strength I'm literally mentally wired to be unbreakable.

And hey again if you came down for a tl;dr and saw the link claude again hold your horses yes I'm rude about it but claude just listened to me. you open the chat and watch the true raw firepower a human brain can still bring to the table. The AI listens to me pal, not the other way around. In a world where it's hard to tell between what's human and what's AI - my tone, my personal tone, the command, the raw fucking emotional weight and heft I can bring to the show it is definitely something humans feel on a visceral level. That is my warranty in case my conversation isn't enough I am that guy to stamp my name into the stone and send it out and if asked I'll double down on it - this a conversation between a human who is the originator of posthuman ideas an an AI that simply listens because said human is sleepless.



Grab a coffee or a snack or something and have a read and be mesmerised by truly original information that as I've Asperger's I've posted nowhere else yet - you are at the cutting edge of the cutting edge in terms of pure posthuman vision. I am that guy. Given the grandness of my scope for posthuman vision, the fact that my ego is like this at 28 sleepless multiple Fortune 500 companies I've worked but mental health challenges but an ego this strong would you expect anything less though. I absolutely could/could've changed the entire world. It's a glimpse into a sleepless night of a visionary narrating his vision to a bot.



Understand, the only thing stopping me is mental health.



Actually I have addictions - that's why I came up with the idea of hotswappable reward circuitry. because it's complicated you see - as an addict I don't want to lose it, that's kind of the point, and yet simultaneously I wish I wasn't an addict and you can't have both ways - what if I wanted to though what kind of brain would let me have it both ways. And hey let's throw in a third core reward circuit for good measure. 3 hotswappable core reward loops and a mode select so you can't accidentally trap yourself into the golden prison such that you don't want to go back to mode select.



Anyway have a read, it's on me. Strap yourselves in - let's fast forward to glimpses of posthumanity as I see it.



Feel the firepower. And then, do nothing - the buck stops with me, literally. I'm not mentally well. What can I do right. I'm slated for a psychologist let's see we have no idea.



For now step with me let's fast forward how do I personally envision humanity circa idk if I've to put a ballpark on like the perfect range I'd say 2300s-2500s.



The other day I posted something on LPT one of the comments was bro is an alien. No shit. You want a visionary well here literally now's your chance to look into the mind of the world's strongest and grandest.



Not third strongest, not second grandest. In terms of sheer raw psychological firepower I am number one.



Would you expecting anything less though. I'm 28 gentlemen. Fucking just 28. What a waste of potential.



I live in a world where my doc won't give me naltrexone so I can try and treat my addictions he thinks it's too risky for his job because naltrexone isn't indicated - that's the world I live in who the fuck is going to take on board my idea of hot-swappable neural reward circuitry with neutral mode select so I can indulge my addiction and have control to return to mode select and when I select to engage in another reward circuit loop and in that other loop the thought of my addiction is so distant it feels like another human being who would do that and then I can return to mode select.



LPT bro called me an alien. Yep it kind of takes one doesn't it do come up with thoughts even AI can't come up with.



I'll end my tape recorder here but take a dive with me ladies and gentlemen let's go into the future. let's take away the blackness of what's been discussed before what ideas have been circled around let's shine the light on things you've never imagined before. Enjoy.

Let's hope the melatonin works tonight huh. Me properly packaged up by competent medical professionals - the wonders that await all of us if I was able to run a corporation and put things into action.

I have strong conviction that Management/Strategy consulting is the most suitable career for me. I am not worries about the hours, and believe it aligns most closely with my skills and interests than what I am currently in. However, I‚Äôm not sure where to start.

Brief Background: Law degree, and worked in Corporate Law for a bit. Was interesting but narrow and being someone interested in more (i.e business and finance), I moved into a finance role in London. For my age, comp is very good, and I am confident in my place in the firm, but it lacks any creativity. Throughout university and since, I founded and ran multiple businesses as well on the side (mix of results, some moderate with positive cashflow, one failure, one six figure turnover). 

While I appreciate it isn‚Äôt a great look to flip-flop between careers, I think all of these experiences will be helpful in a consulting role. I don‚Äôt have an MBA, but Law degree from one of the top UK law schools, got A*s in both Econ and Business at A-level, and have practical experience within the corporate world. In my current Finance role, I interact daily with CEO‚Äôs, PE firms etc so would like to say I feel comfortable with that side of consulting as well. Also have intern experience in PE, Insurance and with a startup-D2C company.

However, I don‚Äôt have any connections in the area. I live and work in central london/the city so if anyone does have any insights i‚Äôd be happy to take you out for coffee or pay for a call. 

Any advice, guidance etc would be much appreciated. (or criticism if you think i‚Äôm off the mark!)

I like the guy a LOT BUT because of feeling in doubt about having a partner due to the way I look Ive turned to h00k U|>s and it's only because I feel loved when they talk to me or any sort of touching or rubbing.

I have strong conviction that Management/Strategy consulting is the most suitable career for me. I am not worries about the hours, and believe it aligns most closely with my skills and interests than what I am currently in. However, I‚Äôm not sure where to start.

Brief Background: Law degree, and worked in Corporate Law for a bit. Was interesting but narrow and being someone interested in more (i.e business and finance), I moved into a finance role in London. For my age, comp is very good, and I am confident in my place in the firm, but it lacks any creativity. Throughout university and since, I founded and ran multiple businesses as well on the side (mix of results, some moderate with positive cashflow, one failure, one six figure turnover). 

While I appreciate it isn‚Äôt a great look to flip-flop between careers, I think all of these experiences will be helpful in a consulting role. I don‚Äôt have an MBA, but Law degree from one of the top UK law schools, got A*s in both Econ and Business at A-level, and have practical experience within the corporate world. In my current Finance role, I interact daily with CEO‚Äôs, PE firms etc so would like to say I feel comfortable with that side of consulting as well. Also have intern experience in PE, Insurance and with a startup-D2C company.

However, I don‚Äôt have any connections in the area. I live and work in central london/the city so if anyone does have any insights i‚Äôd be happy to take you out for coffee or pay for a call. 

Any advice, guidance etc would be much appreciated. (or criticism if you think i‚Äôm off the mark!)

Let‚Äôs dive into the BTC order book while you sip your morning coffee.

Current price range:
We‚Äôre sitting between $84,000 ‚Äì $85,800, and it‚Äôs clear this zone is packed with action.

‚∏ª

Order Book Heatmap ‚Äì Key Levels

Resistance (limit sell walls):

	‚Ä¢	85,800 ‚Äì 441 BTC
	‚Ä¢	85,700 ‚Äì 428 BTC
	‚Ä¢	85,600 ‚Äì 463 BTC
	‚Ä¢	85,500 ‚Äì 447 BTC

The upper zone is loaded with sell orders. Someone really doesn‚Äôt want price to break above ‚Äî most likely institutional players or funds placing thick walls to keep things capped for now.

Support (limit buy walls):

	‚Ä¢	84,200 ‚Äì 1,180 BTC
	‚Ä¢	84,300 ‚Äì 773 BTC
	‚Ä¢	84,000 ‚Äì ~800 BTC

This is some serious buy-side pressure. These walls look like accumulation zones ‚Äî big players are scooping up BTC and not letting it fall below this range.

‚∏ª

Trade Flow (T&S):

Most trading activity is concentrated between 84,200 ‚Äì 84,500 right now.
Lots of small market orders (5‚Äì10 BTC) going through ‚Äî shows a calm but confident market, without panic.

‚∏ª

Market Sentiment:

	‚Ä¢	Order book volume up +23%
	‚Ä¢	Overall supply down -9%

This hints at sell-side orders being slightly pulled back while buyers are stepping in more aggressively. Could be a sign of quiet accumulation.

‚∏ª

TL;DR:

	‚Ä¢	Strong support wall at 84,200

	‚Ä¢	Thick resistance zone up to 85,800

	‚Ä¢	A breakout from either side could trigger a sharp move ‚Äî
Shorts might get squeezed above, weak longs might panic below.

For now, it looks like the whales are still playing tug-of-war, keeping price in this tight zone over the weekend. I expect we stay here until some fresh news or catalyst hits the market.

‚∏ª

Stay caffeinated. Stay patient.
