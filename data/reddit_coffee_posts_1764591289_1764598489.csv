""No."" / ""Nope~""_

_""Happy birthday. Joint gift: here's your coffee.""_

_""…Sigh. Thanks… all three of you.""_

_""Why are you wearing sunglasses at night?""_

_""To run out and block you guys, obviously. I couldn't just show up openly.""_

_""But Rodney, didn't you just say that wearing sunglasses to hide your identity only happens in movies?""_

_""…""_

_""Well, at least one idiot fell for it.""_

_""Luke, ARE YOU CALLING ME THE IDIOT?!""_

_""Nooo, our little bird has gotten smarter~""_

_""?! Just so you know— my place only has three rooms! You can’t all—""_

My grandfather was a farmer his whole life, but he passed away when I was 11. My mom inherited his land, but it took almost 10 years for her to sort out all the documents and divide the property with her sister.

Now we’ve ended up with about 56 acres. My mom is thinking about selling it—unless I want to become a farmer and take it over.

The thing is, I kind of hate my current job (I work at an investment bank in the state capital). It’s really stressful, to the point where some days I literally sleep in the bathroom out of exhaustion.

Lately I’ve been thinking about moving to the countryside to work the land, but I have no idea where to even start. The property is about 6 hours away from where I live, and I’d have to move in with my grandmother and basically leave my current life behind. The region is one of the best in Brazil for farming coffee and dairy cows, but again—I don’t know anything about either of those.

Does anyone have tips on how I could start learning about this kind of business? Things like courses, books, or resources about living off the land and running a small farm? And how could I figure out if this lifestyle would really be a good fit for me?

[Lowkey RP Discord](https://discord.gg/vfnTCuwr5x)

Welcome to Lowkey RP! We are a brand new FiveM roleplay server built for players who love immersive stories, relaxed economy, and a community that grows together. Our staff team has been where you are. Looking for a home that has all the standards of roleplay you want but not a economy that requires you to work a 9-5 to enjoy. We've spent the last couple of months building the foundation to bring back the old feeling for 2017 roleplay!

We’re launching into beta today! (December 1st), and this is your chance to be part of building the community. Whether you’re a dedicated RPer or brand new , Lowkey RP is shaping into a city where your character’s story actually matters.

We offer a place for people to come and be the character that they want to be. We offer **zero real life pay options**. Everything that is brought to the community is brought in by our owners and staff members. **You do not need to pay to open a business or to start a gang.** 

**Fresh City where we value Quality Over Quantity**

Lowkey RP is designed to offer meaningful, slow burn and story driven RP. Every member matters, every storyline moves into the next, and you have the chance to make your mark early. 



# Hidden Illegal Activities

The criminal world in Lowkey RP isn’t just “go here, press E.”  
We’ve built a system full of discovery, and progression:

* Secret illegal routes & activities.
* Hidden crafting and underground tech.
* Factions are given special illegal items that they'll control.
* Boosting & Racing.
* Opportunities for gangs and crews to form during Beta.

If you want a city where crime feels earned, not handed out, this is for you.



# Balanced Economy with Relaxed Money Making

No more working a 9-5 in city hours just to buy a car.  
Our economy is:

* Balanced (no pay-to-win vibes, no impossible grind)
* Fair for new players to be able to jump in and not feel behind.
* Rewarding for those who hustle legally or otherwise

Make money your way, jobs, crime, business ownership, side hustles, and more.



# Hiring EMS + LSPD

We’re actively looking for:

**EMS** – From Cadets to High Command  
**LSPD** – Patrol, Detectives, to High Command. Other departments coming in the future.  


# Business Owners Wanted

Want to run something? The city needs:

* Restaurants

1pbdkzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WarBitter5282/comments/1pbdkzm/begin_again/,Begin Again,"The train car was filled to the brim. I was sitting between an old man who carried a huge grey backpack and watched Facebook reels on the loudest volume possible on his phone, and a high school student who smelled faintly of onions. My own backpack weighed heavily on my thighs as I tried to recall the things I had to do once I got home later. Four drug studies. Two nursing care plans. My med-surg transes I started two weeks ago, then have not touched ever since.

I tried to feel for my phone, but it was hard to move when both my hands were full, and the man standing in front of me was literally in between my legs. I felt the train slow to a halt, the split second where it felt like the entire train car had become frozen, then the doors opened, and people elbowed and pushed past each other like it was all a matter of life and death. Unfortunately, the Baclaran stop had only made the train fuller, and I had to adjust my heavy bag on my thighs as the man squeezed himself even closer. I made a mental note to ride in the Women-Only car the next time I had to ride the LRT during rush hour. 



I felt my phone vibrate on my left hip, so I assumed it was in my pocket. Hopefully. The doors swung closed, and the train slowly picked up its pace. Even though Taylor Swift was singing about how she wanted to go back to December through my AirPods, I could hear a lady talking on the phone a few feet away. She sounded angry and irritated, and it seemed like she was spitting into the phone a million miles per hour. I was reminded of my mom, and I smiled to myself as I thought of the poor kid on the other side of the call. 



I caught glimpses of the city skyline through the glass windows, and it suddenly felt like I was in a movie. But if my life were a movie, I wouldn’t be riding a jam-packed train at 6 pm, commuting home from a long day of lectures about the different types of carcinomas and tumors and chemotherapy and radiation and the important nursing interventions I shouldn’t forget about as a nurse. If my life were a movie, I wouldn’t be listening to sad songs, feeling sorry for myself. I wouldn’t be thinking of a certain tattooed man who made me iced coffees without asking, who waited with his Aerox and an extra helmet by the gates for me, who stayed up at night with me while I studied for exams and recitations, even though he had had a long day himself. My life wasn’t a movie, and so I had a taste of something good, something beautiful, something stable and deep, and the universe snatched it away from me just as quickly as I fell. 



I felt sorry for myself because even though I had a million things going on in my life, even though I had bigger fish to fry, he somehow always still found his way through the crowd. He pops up at unexpected, unwanted times. He pops up when I’m in line for the elevator, when I’m crossing the street, when I’m waiting for my setting spray to dry down. The only time I stopped thinking about him was when I was afraid I was gonna fail my midterm exam and that my professor was going to call me out on it in front of everyone. I was restless, irritated, and hungry as I walked out of that exam hall, and when I finally made my way to the cafeteria to treat myself to some very undeserving breakfast, there he was. In the flesh. He wasn’t a figment of my imagination anymore. Any ounce of hunger I felt before was gone; I just wanted to take my backpack and go home. 



I tried not to think about how I used to wrap my arms around him as I wearily stood up to make my way towards the glass doors. I tried not to worry about where he was and who he now goes home to as I pushed my way through the sea of backpacks and unmoving men. I stepped out of the train car, careful not to accidentally fall into the gap and into the train tracks, and I felt unusually light, like a heavy weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I tapped my Beep card, and I waited for the screen to turn green before I pushed through the metal bar. I had already reached the stairs when my AirPods made a weird sound, then just stopped playing music altogether. I made a face, confused. Then I realized why I felt unusually light. 



I looked back at the tracks, but it was too late; the train had left the station already. I could feel the panic in my veins as I scrambled to think about what to do next. I thought about my dad, how he would react when I told him that I left both my phone and wallet on the train. I thought about how I was supposed to do my drug studies when I listed the drugs on the Notes app of my phone. I thought about how I could just catch a bus going to Baguio and just run away from everything and everyone. But a bus to Baguio costs money, and my money was in my wallet on a train currently making its way farther and farther away from me. 



I had no choice but to walk home, feeling defeated and incredibly stupid as I tried to think of how I would explain what just happened to my parents. When I got home, the house was empty. The silence felt heavier than my backpack, which I dropped onto the couch before collapsing beside it. I could still feel my heart pumping from the panic on the platform. I pressed my palms to my face and tried to breathe. I had no phone, no wallet, no way to contact anyone, and no idea how I would explain all of it to my parents.



I did not even realize that I had fallen asleep. When I opened my eyes, the sky outside had already gone dark. The house felt still, like the air itself was waiting for something. I grabbed my laptop out of habit, thinking I should try to do at least one of my requirements, but a notification on the screen caught my attention before anything else.



One friend request.



At first I thought it was a classmate, maybe someone I met in a group assignment and forgot about. But the profile had my name. Only my name. No picture. No posts. No mutual friends. Nothing. Before I could even decide what to do with it, a message appeared.



Claim your phone and wallet at the EDSA Station Lost and Found.



A chill ran through me. I typed back asking who it was, but the message would not send. The little loading circle spun and spun like I had no business trying to know the answer. I shut my laptop quickly, almost like something might crawl out of the screen if I stared at it too long.



My parents arrived not long after. I told them a safer version of the truth. I said I dropped my phone and wallet on the train but someone returned them. My mom nagged me about being careless and my dad asked how I could lose something so important. I nodded and apologized and tried to look sorry. In reality, I could not hear anything except the memory of that message repeating in my head.



The next morning I went straight to the station. The Lost and Found office had the same harsh fluorescent lighting that made everyone look tired. A guard led me to a small counter, where a woman in a blue vest rummaged through a box labeled electronics. She took out my phone and wallet and handed them to me with a relieved expression, as if she was happy to finally get them out of her pile.



A man dropped these off last night, she said. He did not wait long. He seemed to be in a hurry. No name. No message. Nothing.



Everything was intact. Not a single peso was missing. Even the crumpled candy wrappers I kept inside the hidden pocket were still there. It almost felt wrong, like whoever picked them up had touched them but did not want to disturb anything. When I got home and turned my phone on, another notification greeted me.



Message request from: Bea Singson.



My stomach twisted. I opened it even though I already knew I should not.



Ingat ka palagi.



That was it. No explanation. No reason. No identity. But for some strange reason, the message felt familiar. It felt like something meant for me alone, something gentle and heavy at the same time. I could not reply. I did not know how to reply to someone who borrowed my name. I checked my gallery next, and that was when I saw it. A new photo. It was blurry and dark, taken inside the train. The skyline outside the window looked hazy. The glass reflected a man holding a phone. My phone. He was wearing a plain shirt. His face was blurred, and I could not make out the features, yet the shape of him felt like someone I should recognize. My mind tried to match him to memories: a stranger I brushed past, someone from school, someone I used to hold close, but nothing fit perfectly. The more I stared, the more my chest tightened. I forced myself to close the gallery and move on.



A year passed. Somehow, the incident melted quietly into the background of my life. I got busier with school. I took more exams, more duties, more late-night study sessions. I thought I had forgotten everything. Then one late afternoon, I was back on the LRT on my way home. The car was crowded and warm, and my arms were getting tired from gripping the metal rail. I tried to distract myself by staring at the station names flashing above the doors.



Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a man standing on the other end of the car. He was wearing a plain shirt. His back was turned to me, but something about him made the hairs on my arms prickle. The shape of his shoulders. The way he stood. The strange stillness around him despite all the people pushing and swaying. It was the same feeling I had when I saw the photo. A slow, unsettling recognition. My heartbeat grew louder than the rumbling of the tracks.



He shifted slightly, and I leaned to the side without even thinking. I needed to see his face. I needed to confirm something I did not have the courage to name. For a second, I felt like he sensed me. He tilted his head, just enough that I could glimpse the line of his jaw. The train slowed at the next station. The doors opened and the crowd surged forward. Bodies pressed between us. People blocked my view. I tried to push through. By the time I reached the space where he had been standing, he was gone. I stood there gripping the rail, breath caught in my throat, unable to move. I still did not know who he was. Or why he felt so familiar. Or why the memory of that message, Ingat ka palagi, suddenly pulsed in my head like a heartbeat.



All I knew was that it was not over.

1pbdjlu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmProducts/comments/1pbdjlu/what_to_do_if_my_smart_plug_app_freezes/,What to do if my smart plug app freezes?,"Getting stuck with a frozen smart plug app can be super frustrating, especially when you just want to control your lights or coffee maker. The good news is that most app freezes have simple fixes that take less than five minutes to sort out.

**Quick Fixes to Try First**

Start with the basics - force close your smart plug app and restart it. On most phones, you swipe up from the bottom and clear the app completely. Then open it fresh. This solves the problem about 70% of the time.

If that doesn't work, restart your phone. It sounds too simple, but it clears out temporary glitches that mess with app performance. While your phone restarts, unplug your smart plug from the wall outlet for about 30 seconds, then plug it back in.

**Check Your Connection**

Your smart plug needs a solid WiFi connection to work right. Open your phone's WiFi settings and make sure you're connected to your home network. If the signal looks weak, move your smart plug closer to your router or consider getting a WiFi extender.

Sometimes the smart home device loses its connection to your network completely. You might need to reconnect it through the app settings. Look for options like ""Add Device"" or ""Reconnect Device"" in your app menu.

**Update Everything**

Outdated software causes tons of problems with smart home technology. Check if your app needs an update in the App Store or Google Play Store. While you're at it, make sure your phone's operating system is current too.

The smart plug itself might need a firmware update. Most apps have a section in settings that shows if updates are available for your connected devices.

**When Nothing Else Works**

If your app keeps freezing after trying everything, you might need to delete and reinstall it. Before you do this, write down any schedules or automation you set up, since you'll need to recreate them.

As a last resort, factory reset your smart plug. There's usually a small button you hold for 10-15 seconds until the light blinks a certain way. Check the instruction manual for exact steps since every brand is different.

**Prevention Tips**

Keep your smart plug away from thick walls or metal objects that block WiFi signals. Don't overload it with devices that pull too much power - check the wattage limits in the specifications.

If you're dealing with constant freezing issues and need a reliable replacement, you can find quality options with good reviews at [this smart plug collection](https://athomewave.com/smart-plug). Having a dependable smart plug means fewer headaches and smoother home automation.

Most freezing problems come down to connectivity issues or outdated software. Run through these steps in order, and you'll likely get your wireless plug working again without needing tech support. If problems continue after all these fixes, contact the manufacturer - your device might be defective.

Remember that smart home devices work best when your home network is strong and stable. Investing in better WiFi coverage pays off when you're running multiple connected devices. You can compare different smart plug models and find one that fits your setup at [this link](https://athomewave.com/smart-plug).",1,1764597733.0,UmmProducts,0,1.0,False

You're not trying to go to the gym, you're trying to become ""a gym person."" You're not trying to write, you're trying to become ""a writer."" And your brain can smell the bullshit from a mile away.

I realized this when I kept failing at morning routines for like two years straight. I'd wake up, try to be this zen productivity monk, feel like an imposter by 7am, and give up by Tuesday. The problem wasn't the habit. It was that I was asking my brain to roleplay as someone I fundamentally didn't believe I was. And your subconscious will sabotage anything that feels like a lie.

Here's what actually works: do the thing so small and boring that it doesn't require becoming anyone. Don't ""start a meditation practice"" - sit still for 90 seconds after your coffee while staring at the wall like an idiot. Don't ""become a reader"" - open a book on the toilet. The habit has to be so unglamorous, so divorced from identity, that your ego doesn't get involved. Once you've done the tiny version for two weeks without thinking about what it makes you, you can build. But not before.

**The habit sticks when you stop trying to transform and just... do a thing. That's it.

No doubt there being a hijabi has zero deeper meaning and was probably just done for diversity/worldbuilding, BUT we're gonna ignore that and speculate the in-universe implications anyway! (The power of the 'tism 😌). 

Anyway,

Since there's a hijabi in this universe, then by extension Islam exists there too. 

I'm still fairly new to Islam and still need to expand my Islamic knowledge, but from what I understand so far, basically the reason that Islam exists in this universe is because Muslims believe that the Qur'an is the direct word of God that was revealed to the Prophet Muhammed ﷺ.

Let's not argue whether it actually happened or no in real life. Let's just agree that it's up for debate, or at least to be respectful of other views, no matter where you stand. Here we're just focusing on the hellaverse and the hellaverse alone. 

| MY REQUEST TO THE MODS: Please DON'T lock this post if things get out of hand. Still let the people who properly engage with the core topic of this post (Islam IN-UNIVERSE), engage as they please, even if there are few and even if there are people who don't.

| FOR EVERYONE TEMPTED TO DEBATE RELIGION: I know it's hard not to, especially online, but please engage with this post with the intention to have a respectful speculative discussion about Islam in the Hellaverse, not Islam in real life.

Back to my point.

IN THE HELLAVERSE that means there are people who BELIEVE that Muhammed ﷺ is a prophet. This also means Muhammed ﷺ existed in the Hellaverse and proclaimed prophethood there.

However...

THE DIFFERENCE FROM REAL LIFE:

In our universe, we can't say with absolute certainty whether he ﷺ was a prophet or not. There are arguments for and against and we can each make our best guess with the available info (either for or against)

But in the Hellaverse, from Heaven and Hell, we know for a fact that Christianity (or some form of it) is the one true religion there.

That means that IN THE HELLAVERSE, Muhammed ﷺ was, WITHOUT A DOUBT, a false prophet.

IN THE HELLAVERSE, we don't know the exact origins of his ﷺ claims- whether he.ﷺ was deluded or just made it up- but we know for a fact he ﷺ was a false prophet there.

Does all this really matter? Probably not lol. The in-universe implications for these things- especially the things I'm hyperfixated on (Islam, Hellaverse, etc. even.) are just really interesting to think about :)",3,1764597170.0,hazbin,1,1.0,False

**Available Dec 15 – March (flexible end date) | Perfect for Remote Workers / Founders / SF Commuters**

Looking for a clean, safe, growth-oriented place to land for a few months while you grind, reset, or build? I’ve got a furnished room opening up in our newly remodeled home right by Lake Merritt BART, it's literally a 1-minute walk.

This is ideal if you work in tech, the startup world, or simply want a supportive, respectful home base with chill, ambitious roommates.



# About the Home

* 1 minute from Lake Merritt BART — be in San Francisco in 10 minutes
* Right next to Oakland Chinatown (1 minute walk), the lake, and downtown
* Located directly across from a police station for a safe, low-stress environment
* Fully renovated 4 bed / 2 bath home
* Furnished room
* Fast internet (750 Mbps)
* Sunny backyard great for remote work, coffee, workouts, or small gatherings
* Storage space available



# About Us (Your Roommates)

You’d be living with 2–3 guys (30s–40s) working in Marketing, Sales, AI Engineering, and Startups.

The landlord (me) is:

* A startup founder
* A global traveler
* Respectful, chill, and low-drama
* Very pro-diversity, pro-LGBTQ, and welcoming of all backgrounds

The house vibe is focused, kind, ambitious, but relaxed.  
We’re not a party house — but we’re social, collaborative, and keep the home clean.

We’re the kind of roommates who:

* Help if you get locked out
* Invite you to new hobbies or events
* Have deep conversations about AI, work, and life
* Occasionally share meals
* Have a communal, friendly dog (you can walk her around the lake if you want, but no responsibilities required)

Think: a Hustle House with structure, respect, and balance.

* Startup founders, operators, salespeople, engineers
* Anyone grinding on a project or in life transition

Me and my other half are strolling along the beach and having small talks while we wait for sunset. Ambiance is nice and having a good quality time together. And then nightfall comes and we decided to go back home. On our way back home we saw two guys in balaclava stabbing another guy.

1pbd9rb,https://i.redd.it/ezp917nwkl4g1.png,The Silent Grief of Your First Canadian Holiday Season: What No One Tells New Immigrants,"I’m sitting in my downtown Vancouver apartment on a Saturday afternoon in early December, staring at my phone. My mom just sent a video of Bruno, our Golden Retriever, sleeping in my old bedroom — the room that still has my engineering textbooks on the shelf and the fairy lights I hung up five years ago. The winter sunlight (the kind that actually feels warm) is streaming through the window in the video. In Vancouver, it’s 4 PM and already dark. The kind of dark that feels like it’s swallowing me whole.

I moved to Canada eight months ago for a software position at a tech company I’d dreamed of joining since my final year at Thapar. The offer letter felt like validation of every late night I’d spent coding, every sacrifice my parents made for my education, every time my dad told relatives with pride, “Meri beti Canada jaa rahi hai.” He had tears in his eyes at the airport — pride, I’d thought then. Now I wonder if he was also crying because he knew something I didn’t: that success would taste different than I imagined, that winning could also feel like losing.

No one warned me about this. About how my first Canadian winter would crack something open inside me that I didn’t know was there.

# The Weight No One Mentions

The job is everything I’d hoped for. My manager praises my work. I’m building the career I always wanted. On paper, I’m thriving. On LinkedIn, I’m #grateful and #blessed. In my body, I’m carrying a grief so heavy I sometimes can’t get out of bed on weekends.

“I feel ungrateful even saying this,” I told my roommate one evening, my voice cracking. “I have everything I wanted. Why do I feel like I’m drowning?”

She looked at me with genuine confusion. “Maybe you’re just adjusting?”

But I’m learning that some things don’t get easier — they just get more familiar. Missing my mom calling me “puttar” every morning. Bruno’s head on my lap. Eating dinner alone while my family’s WhatsApp group lights up with Sunday lunch photos — twelve people around a table, my chachi making aloo parathas, laughing at inside jokes I’m no longer part of.

December amplifies everything. My coworkers excitedly plan Christmas while I calculate flight costs I can’t afford and time off I won’t get approved for. The festive cheer everywhere feels like a spotlight on my isolation.

# The Silence Makes It Worse

What makes it unbearable isn’t just the grief — it’s the silence around it. Everyone back home in Chandigarh thinks I’m living my best life. My Instagram shows the beautiful Vancouver skyline, trendy coffee shops, weekend hikes. I can’t post about crying in the grocery store because the masala chai brand I found tastes nothing like the chai my mom makes every morning. I can’t tell my parents that their pride in my achievement feels like pressure that’s crushing my chest.

At work, I smile through the holiday potluck, pretend to be excited about Secret Santa, and say “Happy Holidays!” back to everyone who says it to me. I’m the only brown face in most meetings. The only one who didn’t grow up with Christmas traditions. The only one who feels like an anthropologist studying a culture I’ll never truly belong to.

The isolation isn’t just about missing people — it’s about missing being understood without having to explain. Missing being surrounded by people who get my references, my humor, my values. Missing the version of myself that existed in community, not in solitude. Missing speaking Punjabi without having to switch to English mid-sentence.

I call home every weekend, trying to time it right. Too early and I wake them. Too late and they’re asleep. The video calls feel like looking through a window into a life I can observe but not touch. Bruno barks at my voice coming from the phone, confused about where I am. My mom holds the phone close to his face and says, “It’s Priya, baby. It’s your Priya.” And I cry after hanging up, the kind of crying that comes from somewhere deep in my bones.

# The Invisible Breaking Point

The week before Christmas, my manager sends me a cheerful Slack message about the office closure dates. “Enjoy your time off! Hope you have wonderful holiday plans!” I stare at the message for ten minutes before typing back a thumbs up emoji.

Time off. Wonderful plans. I have neither family nearby nor the funds to get to them. I have a week stretching ahead of me like a prison sentence — every restaurant closed, every friend with family plans, nothing to do but sit in my apartment and try not to think about the fact that on December 25th, while everyone I know in Canada is opening presents and eating turkey, I’ll be alone with my instant Maggi and my grief.

That night, I barely sleep. My mind spirals: *What am I even doing here? Was it worth it? Should I just go back? But go back to what — I already left that life. I can’t undo this choice. But I can’t keep living like this either.*

The thoughts are exhausting. The loneliness is exhausting. The pretending is exhausting. I’m so tired of being tired.

# When a Friend Offered Something Different

My colleague Maya, who immigrated from the Philippines five years earlier, notices. Over coffee (she insists, despite my attempt to decline), she asks directly: “How are you really doing with your first December here?”

The question, asked with genuine knowing, breaks something open. I cry in the coffee shop. Ugly crying. The kind where you can’t catch your breath. Maya just sits with me, passing napkins, not trying to fix it.

“I felt like I was losing my mind my first winter here,” she says quietly. “The darkness, the distance, the pretending — it’s traumatic. And no one talks about it because we’re supposed to be grateful, right? We chose this.”

She tells me about something that helped her during her hardest season: [Reiki](https://app.coto.world/TPFpCgVfKYb). “I know it sounds woo-woo,” she laughs, “but when everything in your life is in your head — the overthinking, the guilt, the grief — sometimes you need something that works with your body, your energy. Talk therapy wasn’t enough for me. I needed something to release what I was carrying physically.”

# The Turning Point

I’m skeptical but desperate. I find a Reiki practitioner who specializes in working with immigrants and diaspora communities — someone who understands that my grief isn’t just homesickness, but a complete recalibration of identity, belonging, and self. and thats how I found [coto](https://app.coto.world/TPFpCgVfKYb).

The[ first session](https://app.coto.world/TPFpCgVfKYb) feels like someone finally gave me permission to stop performing. To stop pretending I’m fine. To stop carrying the weight of everyone’s expectations about how grateful I should be. The practitioner doesn’t try to fix me or tell me to think positive. She just holds space for what I’m feeling and works with the energy that’s stuck in my body — the grief lodged in my chest, the anxiety buzzing in my solar plexus, the exhaustion weighing down my entire system.

“Reiki helps release what we’re holding that we don’t even have words for,” she explains. “Your body is carrying the grief of displacement, the stress of cultural code-switching, the exhaustion of building a life from scratch. We’re going to help your nervous system feel safe again.”

After three sessions over two weeks, something shifts. Not the circumstances — I’m still far from home, still navigating my first Canadian winter, still missing Bruno and my mom and Sunday lunches with my entire extended family talking over each other. But the unbearable heaviness begins to lift. I can breathe deeper. Sleep comes easier. The grief is still there, but it’s not drowning me anymore.

The Reiki sessions become my anchor through December. Each session feels like coming home to myself, even when I can’t go home to India. I learn that healing isn’t about making the pain go away — it’s about creating enough space inside myself to hold both the grief and the growth, the loss and the opportunity, the homesickness and the new life I’m building.

# What Changes When You Stop Carrying It Alone

By the time December 25th arrives, I have a plan. I’ve connected with two other first-year immigrants through a community group Maya introduced me to — one girl from Gujarat, another from Kerala. We spend Christmas Day together — cooking food from our respective homes, sharing stories about our worst moments and our small victories, laughing about the absurdity of trying to explain our families’ confusion about why Canada closes everything on Christmas.

I make rajma chawal, the way my mom makes it. It doesn’t taste exactly right — something about the water here, or maybe the beans — but it’s close enough to make me cry happy tears instead of sad ones.

It’s not the Christmas I would have chosen. But it’s not the devastating isolation I’d feared either. I’ve learned that survival isn’t about being okay with everything — it’s about finding ways to hold yourself together when everything feels like it’s falling apart.

I still cry on video calls with my family. Bruno still barks at my voice through the phone. I still feel the acute pain of missing big moments — my cousin’s wedding in January that I can’t attend, my dad’s birthday in February that I’ll celebrate twelve hours late via WhatsApp. But I’ve found something crucial: a practice that helps me process the grief instead of drowning in it, and a growing understanding that healing happens not by making the pain smaller, but by making myself stronger.

# For Everyone in Their First December Far From Home

If you’re reading this in your first Canadian winter, far from everyone you love, carrying grief that no one warned you about — you’re not broken. You’re not ungrateful. You’re not failing at immigration.

You’re experiencing one of the most profound human challenges: rebuilding your entire sense of home and self in a place that doesn’t yet feel like either. The holiday season will amplify it. The darkness will intensify it. The cheerful celebrations around you will highlight it.

But you don’t have to carry it alone, and you don’t have to carry it in silence. There are ways to release what your body is holding that words can’t reach. There are practices that help your nervous system recalibrate when everything feels foreign and hard. There are people who understand — who’ve walked this path and survived it and can remind you that you will too.

My first winter is teaching me that the life I wanted comes with losses I didn’t expect. That success can coexist with grief. That gratitude and pain aren’t opposites — they’re often companions. That being far from home doesn’t mean I have to feel homeless in my own body.

I still have hard days. Days when I see my mom’s missed calls because of the time difference and want to throw my phone across the room. Days when I hear Punjabi being spoken on the SkyTrain and have to fight the urge to follow those strangers just to be near my language. Days when the rain feels personal, like even the weather here is crying.

But I’m learning something that no one told me when I boarded that flight from Delhi eight months ago, when my parents stood at the airport waving until they couldn’t see me anymore: healing isn’t about going back to who I was before. It’s about becoming someone who can hold all of it — the dreams and the sacrifices, the wins and the losses, the life I’m building and the home I’m missing.

And sometimes, that transformation begins not with thinking your way through it, but with letting your body finally release what it’s been carrying in silence.",1,1764597034.0,u_cotoapp25,0,1.0,False

I have an 12 week-old golden retriever puppy, and I think I may have made some mistakes early on with how I handled training.

Whenever she jumps on our couch (she’s not allowed on any furniture except her bed), or on the table, coffee table, or her playpen, my husband and I say “off.” She does get off (usually have to to say it multiple times) and we say “yes,” which is her reinforcement marker for positive behavior — and then she immediately goes into a sit and just stares at us waiting for a treat.

She does the exact same thing with “drop it.” She’ll drop whatever is in her mouth (again after a few times saying it and trying to get it from her), we say “yes,” and then she instantly looks up expecting the reward. Same with “leave it.”

I feel like we accidentally reinforced the idea that she only does these commands for treats, and now shes going to think that if she does the behavior she’ll get one. But I have no idea how to get her to reliably do “off,” “drop it,” and “leave it” without her expecting a treat every single time.

1pbd8e3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1pbd8e3/brutalist_new_theme_pending_review/,BRUTALIST — New Theme (pending review),"**What is it?**

A stark, geometric theme for Obsidian that prioritises function and raw aesthetics over softness or embellishment. The theme features a strictly angular, squared-off user interface, eliminating all rounded corners for a precise, purposeful appearance. The colour scheme is defined by low-contrast shades of grey and an accentuating blue highlight, engineered to maintain focus and minimise visual strain. It is named 'Brutalist' because its main aesthetic inspiration is Brutalist architecture. You can find the repository on my [Github](https://github.com/DuckTapeKiller/Brutalist) account. 

**Why I made it?**

The goal was to create a theme that prioritises focused reading and note creation by offering an exceptionally low-distraction, text-centric interface. This design is aimed at users who require deep work and minimal visual clutter.

The dark mode draws inspiration from focused reading applications such as Instapaper and Safari’s 'Reader View'. It features a low-contrast palette engineered for optimal reading comfort in varied lighting conditions.

The light mode serves as an alternative for users who prefer a slightly more varied colour scheme, while still maintaining the core design principles of text primacy and minimal visual interruption.

**Who is this theme for?**

The theme was designed for people who spend, or want to spend, significant time in Obsidian reading their notes. This is particularly useful for those who use **Obsidian Web Clipper** to save their articles and use Obsidian as a read-it-later app. It would also be useful for writers or coders who want to be focused, almost isolated from the world.

**Where to download?**

The theme is ready to use, but pending review for inclusion in the Obsidian community themes. However, you can download it now from my GitHub repository.

1pbd7wo,https://i.redd.it/2onqabbjkl4g1.jpeg,Eric Orwoll: The Slip of The Tongue,"Return to the Land (RTTL)  - 40 min North of Jonesboro: Arkansas’ Ongoing National Embarrassment - ADMISSION:
Just 40 minutes north of Jonesboro, Arkansas, the extremist compound known as Return to the Land (RTTL) has now openly confirmed what everyone already suspected: they’re actually rejecting housing applicants based on race.Yes, you read that correctly. Not 1955. Not a history book. Arkansas, 2025.

For those who haven’t been following this saga of backwoods authoritarian cosplay: RTTL has been widely described as a neo-Nazi - aligned enclave in Ravenden, where leadership appears intent on resurrecting Jim Crow–style housing policies  -  complete with barring Jews and non-White applicants.

They’ve been in the national spotlight for months. CNN, MSNBC  -  you name it.


And through it all, we’ve had to endure Eric Orwoll’s media performances: a potent cocktail of virtue signaling, revisionist history, and creative storytelling.

What the media rarely bothers to mention is that both co-founders carry highly controversial histories - THEY ARE BOTH SCAM ARTISTS running an illegal land scam. 

Eric Orwoll: a pornographer, failed unemployed musician, grifter, drug addict and a polygamist who, despite his elitist education, has never held a career - he now lectures America on family values. 

Peter Csere: another unemployed scam artist, failed musician, who fled Ecuador with an outstanding attempted murder warrant  - also accused by two of his communities for embezzling funds and destroying accounting records prior to fleeing Ecuador. Another ""exemplary"" citizen telling us what's wrong with America, and how he could fix it. 

Folks, living solely off the charitable donations handed to them by other Neo-Nazis, these are the men overseeing real estate and money decisions in Arkansas in 2025.🤣🤣
Truly inspiring leadership, no? 

Multiple complaints already filed for illegal sale of unregistered securities and FHA Violations. 

Meanwhile, Arkansas authorities have been repeating the same tired script:


“We’re looking into it… no non-White applicants have applied or been rejected… nothing to see here…”

Well, on November 26, that excuse went up in smoke thanks to two tweets from RTTL’s self-appointed Grand Poobah, who essentially confirmed the racial gatekeeping everyone has been warning about.

Full report:
https://nexiswirereport.substack.com/p/after-months-of-silence-a-single

So here’s the real question:

How much longer is the government going to pretend this isn’t happening?
Apparently, the exclusion of minorities wasn’t enough to motivate action. Governor Sarah Huckabee and her AG Griffin couldn't care less about minorities being denied housing - and its' clear. 


But now that Orwoll is reportedly rejecting White men for having Hispanic or Asian wives, will that finally get someone in power to look up from their coffee?

Or will Arkansas simply continue treating RTTL like a quirky backwoods HOA instead of what it is  -  a stain on the state and a massive embarrassment to the country?

now that the Whites are being denied housing, will Governor Huckabee finally step in and end this grift???

I've basically liked the same girl since middle school. I got close with her and became friends. I never really saw an opportunity to tell her I liked her as I thought it would ruin our friendship. 

In high-school I realized a romantic relationship with her would never happen so I slowly distanced myself from her. Didn't end our friendship, but no more late night calls, no more good morning/ good night messages and no more hanging out just the two of us. As we graduated high school feeling emotional/influence of alcohol I called her and made a fool of myself. After that I pretty much blocked her on every platform and called it a day. 

In college I went on a few dates with girls in my classes but every single time I thought to myself I wonder of I would be grabbing coffee with her if i had asked her out. I wonder if I'd be grabbing lunch with her if I had just taken the first step. I realized I wasn't quite ready for relationships/dating if I wasn't over her yet, so I stopped seeing girls all together.

Moving on to present day I am now in my mid twenties and she is still on my mind. It's weird because I haven't talked to her in years. Do I need a therapist or something? Should I just message her randomly telling her how I feel? Not really in love(i dont think at least), but she's just constantly in my mind. I'm quite the introverted guy so I don't really have anyone to talk to about this. Thought I'd post this here and get some input from other people. ",0,1764596864.0,Advice,1,0.33,False

Their friendship began in adolescence and grew with them, until this wall became a witness to their years together.

Every time I stand in front of this picture, a heaviness fills my chest, and I find myself thinking:

# Friendships of youth

 

After retirement, I often find myself standing alone before this wall, even though all my friends are still alive and well. Questions pour through my mind without pause:

*Why did things turn out this way? Did I change? Did they? Why... really, why?*

Sometimes I try to convince myself that it’s because they all come from the same family line, while I’m different. But then I remind myself: we became connected through marriage, through family ties. I should’ve grown closer, not further. And yet the doubt returns: maybe that is the reason… maybe the closeness of our families is exactly what created the distance.

**YES, we were loyal friends for years, but after the family ties deepened, something in the dynamic began to shift.**

I recall one friend in particular, the one I became connected to through a marriage between some of our relatives. During that period, his wife tried to get closer to me, and I refused out of respect for him and for other family reasons. Not long after, one morning before I had even sipped my coffee in the office, he sent me this picture, and for a moment it made me pause.

https://preview.redd.it/b01fd6lpjl4g1.jpg?width=745&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5abf0e23445afa7d034664988e70e75d10974960

After seeing the picture, a tightness settled in my chest, yet I told myself: ***maybe it’s for the best.***

It felt as if the world had flipped upside down, moving in reverse. And sometimes I wonder: was it the growing closeness between our families that pushed us apart as friends?

I still remember what he once told me:

***Friendship is an exchange… what can you give me, and what can I give you? If nothing is shared, then it isn’t friendship.***

I stayed silent then, but now, as I drive alone, I catch myself speaking out loud:

*If* relationships *are measured by benefit, then where is brotherhood?*

*Where is family?*

*Where is the father who raises his children without expecting anything in return, or the mother who protects her little ones without waiting for reward?*

***What value is left in this world if every bond is weighed by profit?***

 

**All of this makes me pause and reflect deeply.**

It isn’t always ""**family ties**"" nor ""**self-interest**"" that determine the course of a friendship or its sudden distance.

Here is another of my relatives, also a friend from my teenage years, bound to me by blood, not merely through marriage or family connections.

I mentioned him before in one of my posts; he is a psychologist now practicing in the United States.

**The First Model: A Friendship That Existed on Paper Before It Died in Silence.**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1o07as5/comment/nig3nxe/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1o07as5/comment/nig3nxe/?context=3)

Despite the distance, we keep in touch, always sharing our thoughts, our worries, and our daily struggles.

I remember his words; the ones he used to repeat all the time: “**You are a successful person… you really are.**” At the time, I barely gave them any thought, because he was successful himself. He had earned his doctorate in psychology and now works in his field.

His one real struggle was building a family. He went through multiple divorces and faced many hardships, yet he still managed to succeed in so many other areas, achieving things I could hardly dream of accomplishing even a fraction of.

***And yet, once, he sent me this picture via WhatsApp. For a moment, I just stopped and stared.***

It pained me deep down, yet I managed a small smile and told myself: ***perhaps it was just a passing message.***

Later, he acted in a way I had already mentioned in my previous post, and I ended everything with him. He was not even worth a second glance.

# They were five, and we were seven

Every weekend for more than fifteen years, we gathered without fail. Until that fateful day, when one of us decided we should travel together. He argued that ***it was strange to meet every weekend yet never take a trip as a group***.

Eager to encourage us, he booked the tickets himself, imagining it would open a new chapter of shared memories. We traveled, but during the last four days, tensions ran high. Hearts never fully reconciled.

I remember two of them erupting into shouting matches, their voices rising so loud that the locals stared in astonishment.

I even said, half in jest and half in earnest:

*“Take my right cheek and give me a slap.”*

And to the other,

*“Here is my left cheek, go ahead.”*

**Thankfully, neither acted.**

**Yet the damage lingered.**

***The harmony we once had was gone, and it would never return. From my side, resentment took root, and I withdrew, hardened by the experience.***

 

# There is a truth in life that cannot be ignored

**Based on this immutable truth, a guiding principle I hold close and believe in deeply:**

Once something is left behind, do not turn back. Let it go with your heart, your mind, your eyes, and even your memories. To look back is only to reopen old wounds, to stir the pain that time cannot heal, and to chase what is no longer yours.

Few notice the immense effort some pour into appearing ordinary. You may be kind and generous for years without a word of recognition, yet the moment you stumble, all eyes fall upon you.

***Even so,*** *I often tell myself that chapter is closed, that their presence no longer holds sway over me. Yet a passing glance, a whispered word, a memory, or a single picture can awaken the sorrow tucked away, reigniting what I believed long buried.*

 

# Life Goes On

I lose old friendships, yet I find new ones.

I join Couchsurfing, Meetup, and other circles, meeting remarkable people.

But they can never be like the friends of my youth.

Friendships from our teens are built on years of shared laughter, tears, and adventures.

Even if new friendships grow deep over time, sharing fresh laughter, tears, and adventures, they are never quite the same as the bonds of our teenage years.

#  

# The deepest pain I feel these days

The sharpest pain these days comes on weekends. While my family goes out with friends, I stay behind in the quiet of the house, listening to the echoes of old laughter and the memories of adventures that still live in my heart.

I am grateful for my family, for the love, care, and sacrifices they offer every single day. As a parent, I have spent my life trying to keep the family safe, happy, and at peace. I am still strong, still present, and everything I do is out of devotion, never out of anything that could harm the family’s honor. Because of that, I believe parents deserve loyalty, kindness, and love in return.

# So, I hope the young ones in the family do not let those quiet moments pull me back into memories of the past with its good and its bad. I hope they fill my time with their presence, their laughter, and their warmth. I hope they stay close, so the shadows of yesterday have no room to grow.

1pbd3yv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1pbd3yv/please_help_im_losing_my_mind/,Please Help I'm Losing My Mind,"So I've had IBS since high school (pretty sure it was a stress-related trigger). But about 3 years ago I started seeing someone and whenever I was at their place I couldn't poop comfortably. I was always more on the gassiness/diarrhea side before, but I started obsessing over when I would be able to go to the toilet and it made me so stressed about it that I have completely lost the ability to poop comfortably unless I know I have a lot of time and I'm totally alone (or outside in secluded public toilets). 

Even in situations where before I would've been totally comfortable like using the toilet at my parents' house have now become extremely difficult for me to use the toilet. It's like my body tenses up really hard and freezes the bowels completely. I stop feeling the urge to go. Then I get really anxious because I know I haven't gone. And it becomes a loop of more anxiety and being more unable to use the toilet. 

I have recently moved into a flatshare and it's great in every way, except the fact that the toilet makes me feel uncomfortable cause it's close to someone's room and the kitchen and you can hear everything. I've tried doing stuff like playing music or running the shower, putting toilet paper to muffle the sound. They just don't work cause it already puts my body in this stress mode that blocks my bowels. Has anyone had a similar situation? How did you deal with it? Because it's fully a mental block things like drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes, taking laxatives don't work for me at all. It's affecting my ability to function - my sleep, my eating habits, being able to see friends. It makes me so unbearably anxious.  

  
I just want to be able to live my life again.

1pbd3f0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipsOver35/comments/1pbd3f0/can_a_relationship_make_it_if_you_dont_sleep_in/,Can a relationship make it if you don’t sleep in the same bed?,"Hi all! My (f43) boyfriend (m43) refuses to sleep in my bed. He lives next door, will stay until 1-2 am when we start to fall asleep, but as soon as he starts to almost fall asleep, he jumps up and goes home. Sometimes he’ll even come back in the morning for breakfast but he will never stay over! I know he isn’t cheating on me—he lives next door so I’d know. Our sex life is good (considering he doesn’t sleep over) but I really need that bond you get sleeping next to your partner. When I ask him, he just says that he needs his sleep and physically cannot sleep when there is someone next to him.

He’s had some past trauma which I try to keep in perspective—to a point. His past girlfriend had cancer and died and it really changed him. He was an absolute wild child from what I can tell (punk band, anarchy, screw the man and all) but she helped him to start taking life seriously and her death devastated him and changed the course of his life. He did have another girlfriend between us: got very serious with someone (during Covid) right after the girlfriend died and decided he was going to become a family man: bought them a house in the burbs, moved his mom and grandmom into the in-law suite, but it didn’t work out because she was jealous of the attention he gave to his mom (she had an accident and couldn’t walk and the ex got jealous of the attention from what I understand). He then decided he needed to work on himself and was single for over 2 years. He won’t go to therapy, but he’s become really religious (Catholic) and is doing some counseling in a men’s group—but it’s at a coffee shop so I’m skeptical about how much help that it would be, but happy at least that he is finding comfort and community.

Enter me. I move in next door and we become very, very good friends. I had a crush on him true, but nothing happens for a couple years. But last year we admitted our feeling for each other and changed from friends to more than friends. It started with just sex, but then we decided to make it official a couple months later. After about 3 months officially dating I broke up with him over him not sleeping in my bed/refusing to come with me to a family thing out of town—more that he refused to even consider it rather than needing him to come. We decided that we still wanted to be friends so we tried pretending that it didn’t happen and then were best friends. Obviously that didn’t work. When I started dating someone else after like 6 months, he admitted he still had feelings, I admitted mine hadn’t changed and we decided to try again.

When we got back together, we decided that we were going to take it slow and easy and just enjoy each other and let things develop naturally. We aren’t seeing or sleeping with anytime else, but we aren’t exactly serious either. He said he’s ready to be a good partner and be present. I said I was ready to relax and let us be an us. We’ve been dating, like really dating, and it’s been really fun—except at the end of the night when he goes home.

So here are some tidbits that help the story:

1.) the first time we slept together the very first thing he said when we were done was “yay, now we can start having sleep overs!” And then the next day it was, oh did I say that? No I don’t like to sleep with anyone. He joked one time that if we lived together he would want two beds in the same room, I rolled my eyes but I think he was serious.

2.) he had told me stories of his wild youth traveling in his band, and it seems like he has slept in hundreds of girls’ beds (ew, gross but he’s been STD tested and it was a long time ago, lol). If he didn’t want to sleep in the van he had to find someone to go home with.

3.) he’s lived with 3 or 4 serious girlfriends and I’m pretty sure he slept in their beds. I’ve never lived with anyone and have always been really independent. His thing is, I’ve tried it, didn’t like it, prefer sleeping alone. Tbh I also like sleeping alone, but damnit I would like to sleep with him sometimes! And I can’t envision getting serious with a partner and not sleeping with him.

4.) he wasn’t sleeping in a bed for at least a year, possibly two; he could only sleep on his couch (he was depressed and I think finally processing his grief from his girlfriends death since he moved on so quickly). He’s gotten much better and sleeps in his bed now. Makes me think it’s not about me, but still…

5.) he won’t take a shower with me. He said it’s a claustrophobia thing. Is this about me or is this the same thing as the bed thing?

6.) I have an anxious attachment. I’m working on letting things go and to not take everything as a rejection of me and understand that there are other factors that have nothing to do with me.

7.) He has an avoidant attachment style. He grew up very poor with an alcoholic dad who was a nice guy, but who essentially abandoned them financially—can’t pay child support when you’re always unemployed. He’s quiet about his love but shows it through doing acts of service and making time. Nice things around the yard, fix stuff, doing things for my parents—he’s really handy and strong. Cat sits—he’s a great cat daddy. He’ll always jump to help with whatever I need—unless it involves going somewhere he doesn’t want to go to or sleeping in a bed with me apparently.

8.) if I had to assign a spirt animal to my boyfriend I would say old stray alley cat who started showing up at the back door for food and then decided he likes being warm and wants to come inside and make a weird bed next to the fireplace. He’ll never sleep in the bed but will rub on your legs, keep you company, and keep out any rodents.

9.) relationship timeline: friendly neighbor 1 year, friends 2 years, fwb 3 months, boyfriend girlfriend 3 months, broke up 6 months, dating 2 months-present.

I guess my question is has anyone here had success in a relationship where you didn’t sleep in the same bed? Am I making more of a big deal than this needs to be? Do you think I just need to give him more time and eventually he will change his mind? Can a relationship survive not having that level of intimacy as sharing a bed? It kills me that I have finally found a person who I connect with on this crazy level but that something like this could ruin it. Can we work this out or is it a hopeless case?

So I decided to follow a structured 30-day glow-up challenge I made for myself. I didn’t expect much, but the changes surprised me.

Here are some of the things I did each day:

• 10–15 minutes of movement every morning (nothing intense, just something to wake my body up)  
• A simple skincare routine I finally stayed consistent with  
• Daily decluttering (1 small thing at a time)  
• Drinking more water than iced coffee for once  
• One mindset practice a day: journaling, affirmations, or just unfollowing people who drain me  
• A weekly “mini reset” where I cleaned my space, washed my hair properly, and planned my week  
• One small confidence task each day: dressing nicer, using perfume, fixing my posture, etc.

After 30 days:  
• I look healthier  
• My skin improved a lot  
• My anxiety got lighter  
• I actually feel proud of myself for the first time in a while  
• My habits don’t feel forced anymore

""I go outside.""

""I take walks.""

""I'm fine.""

Then I actually tracked it.



**The data was brutal:**

* I thought I got 30-40 minutes a day. Reality: 12 minutes average.
* Weekdays: basically zero. I was a weekend-only sun person.
* Most of my ""outdoor time"" was walking to my car or grabbing coffee. Not real exposure.

I was living like a vampire and had no idea.



**What nobody told me:**

1. Going outside ≠ sunlight. Walking through shade, sitting by windows (UV doesn't pass through glass), quick errands — none of it counts.

2. Timing matters. Morning sun before 11am affects your circadian rhythm differently. Afternoon sun is fine but not the same.

3. Frequency beats duration. Three 10-minute outdoor sessions are better than one 30-minute walk.

4. Your brain can't track this. You literally cannot ""feel"" cumulative sun exposure. You'll always think you got more than you did.



**So I built something:**

An app that tracks what actually matters:

* Total exposure time (from Apple Watch's daylight sensor)
* Number of sessions (encourages multiple breaks)
* Morning sunlight bonus
* A simple 0-100 score so you know where you stand

No guessing. No ""I think I went outside today?""



**The build:**

Two weeks. Zero coding experience. AI tools did the heavy lifting.

Then Apple rejected me 4 times:

* Privacy concerns
* ""Physical Harm"" (lol, sunlight is dangerous?)
* App Completeness (twice)

Each rejection made it better. Shipped last week.

This is fine.,"I'm a few months into my self-taught coding journey, and I've never felt so dumb and so smart at the same time. Today was a new peak. I was working on a small personal project, and a key feature completely broke. Not a nice, clean error message, oh no. Just silent, baffling failure. The console was mocking me with its emptiness.

I spent the entire afternoon, a full six hours, hunched over my monitor. My eyes were burning, my coffee went cold, and I was pretty sure my brain was leaking out of my ears. I tore through every line of code, rewriting entire functions, questioning every life choice that led me to this moment. I was convinced I was just not cut out for this, that my brain was fundamentally incompatible with logic.

Then I saw it. A single, tiny, insignificant comma. It was in the wrong place. A misplaced piece of punctuation that had somehow brought my entire application to its knees. I deleted it, moved it one space over, and hit 'run.' Everything worked perfectly. The wave of relief and fury that washed over me was indescribable. Six hours of my life, gone, because of a comma.

It's moments like these that make me wonder about the sanity of this profession. It’s the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. But honestly, the feeling of finally figuring it out? It’s a rush like no other. It’s what keeps me coming back to the blinking cursor every morning.

1. School was extra noisy because everyone was talking about online sales.


2. Jennifer, my oldest sister, was in full “marketing queen” mode.

🎒 Morning at School — Everyone is still obsessed with Marissa Torres

When I walked into class, Penny and Kira were already scrolling their phones.

Penny whispered,

> “Amy! The mall finally released an update about Marissa Torres.”



She showed me the article —
Marissa was okay, but still embarrassed after the “big belly stuck on the mall signboard” situation.
Even the headline said:
“MARISSA TORRES RESCUED — AND LAUGHING IT OFF.”

Carmen said, “Honestly, she handled it way better than I would.”
Monique added, “I would’ve moved to another country.”
We all giggled so hard that Miss Clarice gave us that look —
the one that says 'Girls, don’t let me confiscate your entire future.'

📚 Recess — Winfrey and Her BOOK HAUL

During recess, Winfrey came bouncing toward us like she drank ten coffees.

“I finished the Narnia remake,” she declared dramatically,
“and I already started reading The Adventures of Tonya Sawyer!”

She showed us the cover —
Tonya Sawyer was sitting on a wooden fence by the river, wearing overalls, with a playful grin.
Winfrey said,

> “Tonya Sawyer is even funnier than Tom Sawyer — she gets into trouble faster than Amy eats snacks.”



I pretended to be offended, but honestly… fair.

Winfrey kept explaining the plot:

Tonya painting the fence

Tonya sneaking into the school attic

Tonya accidentally scaring the townspeople with a prank frog


I said, “This sounds like you wrote it.”
She replied, “THANK YOU.”

Then we all laughed.

🧑‍🏫 Cyber Monday in Class — Teachers Are ALSO Shopping

During History, even Miss Clarice was typing on her laptop faster than usual.

Kira whispered,
“I swear she’s adding things to her shopping cart.”

Then we saw it — Miss Clarice minimized her notes, and for 0.2 seconds…
a tab titled FLASH SALE! 70% OFF LUXURY SCARVES
was visible.

We nearly died trying not to laugh.

💻 After School — Jennifer the Business Legend

When I got home, the house was chaotic —
not from noise…
but from Jennifer shouting triumphantly into her laptop.

Mom whispered,
“Your sister had a very successful Cyber Monday.”

Jennifer came downstairs like she just won a Nobel Prize.
She proudly announced:

> “My campaign boosted sales by 300%!
The brand wants me to direct next quarter’s strategy!”



We all clapped like she was a celebrity.

Vicky said,
“You’re so dramatic.”

Jennifer flicked her hair and replied,
“I’m dramatic AND successful.”

Melissa gave her a bouquet she picked from the garden.
Shelley brought her leftover brownies.
Linda and Nina hugged her.
Gillian asked about the numbers and she actually explained them like a professor.

I smiled and said,
“Congrats, Jenn! You’re officially the Cyber Queen!”

She winked.
“Thank you, Amy. Your title can be… Chief Snack Officer.”

Okay, fair again.

🌙 Tonight

I’m tired, full of noodles, and half of my sisters are still celebrating Jennifer’s success downstairs.
Cyber Monday is ending, the house is warm,
and I’m proud of my big sister —
even if she treats marketing campaigns like Olympic sports.

1pbcwl6,https://i.redd.it/vg6pemh2il4g1.jpeg,"If this reading found you, it's meant for you. (If you're not Sagittarius, pieces or Leo it's not meant for you)","
This is a soul connect- psychic reading that i am making public and deleting soon. I was called to make this and so here i am. There's someone/ or couple people in need.

This reading is meant for someone Sagittarius, Pisces or Leo, for i heard these signs in my sleep last night.

Your reading starts with wonderful things coming your way, I'll expand on their detail, and even tell you things that are currently hidden from you, things your guide/s are trying to show you.

Let's begin.

unlike the ends of the year where a person might feel dreadful for not accomplishing much, i see the person this reading is meant to address actually feeling fine or even thrilled for the end of the year. this isn't something common, and signals beautiful achievement that have occurred this year.

I do see confrontation, letting go and getting over many demons that once plagued you in this life, and she wants me to tell you she's proud of you, this spirit with me that wants you to hear this message. She saw you and appreciates you for following her lead consciously or unconsciously, she knows you felt her.

By the end of this year, you will have known which spirit i am in the company of here, and even if you know now, you will have came across an undenaiable prove of her presence with you and her watching over you by the end of December.

There's love upcoming in your life, something you hadn't experienced before, ever. This could be an already established relationship blooming, or a new lover that will reveal themselves to you, for i can see the energy coming your way and they already have feelings for you. This person isn't interested in you in a shallow way, or just sexually, this person wants to know your soul and sees you for your soul's beauty. This person's only reddish flag is that they're protective of you, if that's considered a red flag for you, you should watch out and make boundaries. This person is absolutely closed to the idea of sharing you with anyone.

I see you currently paying attention to an upcoming problem that you have to deal with, and disregarding all the festive beautiful things that're actually going your way currently. The spirit that's looking over you wants you to look around and feel good about this time of the year, this is the youngest you'll ever be and the oldest you have ever been.. the problem you are fixating upon is very temporary, in fact, it'll resolve itself in less than two weeks if not even less. It's very small in comparison to what is ahead of you.

There is something hiding from your sight currently and you must know, a friend is preparing to back stab you. This so called ""friend"" has been moved by jealousy and is looking for someone to gossip behind your back with. They might have been threatened by your success, or even compare their success to yours, but the key point here you must keep paying attention to, is that this person does seem like the last person you'd think of to back stab you. Very innocent looking and bubbly and hardworking. Think back to any circumstance where you heard a friend of yours gossip about someone else with you, for that if they can do that with other people, they can do it to you.

I am also urged to tell you this, when in doubt, it's probably you're fighting between what you see, and what you hear. believe always what you see, over what you hear.

There's going to be an opening for you soon, to express your opinions clearly and lovingly but it's not Infront the people you expect. You'll find new opportunities and even more friends that show up for you in a way you never expected.. i see a lot of people celebrating, with lights and lovely spirits, people who actually care about you, this could be a flashforward to Christmas, but it's clear you'll enjoy yourself there, so if you're presented with the opportunity to go, take it.

The energy of your body resembles the need for your rest right now, take a day off, your body's energy needs it, it's being deprived right now.

Look forward for the next year, you have a lot of openings and opportunities for career, love and prosperity by then.

and mostly, sort your situation with that back stabbing friend.

One more thing, your spirit guide is someone aged i's day.. 30s? am not good with reading age, but they do look like an adult woman with dark hair.

I am 30 years of age, and I am female. I am in a relationship, and I have no intentions on being anything further than just friends. I will not engage in any weird conversations or actitivies, I am just getting that out there. 

I am strictly here to find online friends. I do not want to meet you in real life and I never, ever will, no matter how long we had been talking for. All of my friendships are online and that is how they will stay. If you're hoping to meet a nice, British woman to meet up with in real life for a coffee then skip me. I am not interested.

To keep this interesting, I will list 3 things I like (in general), and 3 things I dislike as well as 3 random facts about me. Then you can decide if you want to message me based on those things.

I like photography, smoking weed and playing video games. I dislike voice calls, metal music and anime related stuff. The facts are my sister is friends with 2 celebrities, I have multiple health conditions and I can burp the entire alphabet. 

Feel free to contact me for friendship as long as you've read this and fully understand what I am offering in terms of friendship. And also, Discord only. Nothing else. Thanks.",1,1764595926.0,FRIEND,0,1.0,False

1pbctw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Beginning_Zone_5152/comments/1pbctw3/best_mens_multivitamins_on_the_market_a/,best men's multivitamins on the market: a label-reader's cheat sheet,"went to pick up a multivitamin last week and realized i was just staring at bottles for 20 minutes because they all claim to be ""complete"" but the ingredient lists are completely different. ended up going home empty-handed and falling down a research rabbit hole instead. here's what i found so you don't have to do the same thing. start with the deal-breakers, not the brand names before looking at any specific products, here's how to quickly eliminate the garbage: cyanocobalamin + folic acid - these are the older, cheaper versions of b-12 and folate. lots of people convert them fine, some don't. if a bottle still uses both, there are probably more shortcuts hiding underneath. iron by default - unless your last labs showed low ferritin, extra iron can backfire (gut irritation, absorption fights with zinc). most men do better iron-free. megadose vitamin a or e - fat-solubles hang around in your system, daily hammer hits aren't needed if your diet already covers basics. generic ""men's vitality blend"" fluff - tribulus, maca, longjack, etc. none belong in a baseline micronutrient stack. keep botanical experiments separate so you know what's doing what. proprietary dusting - if an ""antioxidant complex"" lists ten plants but totals 50 mg, that's marketing filler, not therapeutic anything. ditch those and the list shrinks fast. five multis that clear the nonsense filter these aren't crowned champions, they're just the ones that survived once the red flags above were stripped away. order is more vibe than ranking, and none hits every want-list point, so note the caveats.

1. [benevolent](https://d3oc4tmn8qmbnq.cloudfront.net/?q=GMKAO651) nourishment men's multivitamin why it survives: decent zinc + magnesium spread (rare under $30), methylated b-12, and a vitamin d number that isn't either microscopic or moon-shot. ingredient list stays lean, no testosterone fairy dust tucked at the bottom. keep in mind: four capsules make a serving. fine if you already juggle fish-oil or creatine pills, annoying if you'd rather forget noon refill alarms.
2. [biotics](https://d3oc4tmn8qmbnq.cloudfront.net/?q=GMKAO689) research pro multi plus why it survives: practitioner crowd swears by the bioactive b-vitamins here (p5p, methylfolate) plus trace minerals like boron and chromium most budget formulas skip. iron-free, soy-free, gluten-free for folks tracking allergens. keep in mind: price lands in the way too high camp, and the heavier mineral load can churn an empty stomach. pair with food or enjoy the roller-coaster burps.
3. thorne basic nutrients 2/day why it survives: nsf-certified batches mean less contaminant anxiety (handy for anyone in tested sports). two caps cover b's, k2, iodine, selenium without padding. thorne also avoids copper, helpful if zinc levels already wobble. keep in mind: only 500 iu vitamin d and zero magnesium. plan a separate d3 + mag if you hide from the sun or crush deadlifts.
4. pure encapsulations o.n.e. why it survives: single capsule convenience yet still squeezes in coq10 and lutein. all b-vitamins in methylated or phosphorylated forms, iron-free, low on excipients. keep in mind: magnesium, calcium, and potassium are basically rounding errors here. this is a ""top-off the gaps"" play, not a stand-alone nutrient firewall.
5. [nutricost](https://d3oc4tmn8qmbnq.cloudfront.net/?q=GMKAO714) multivitamin for men why it survives: went minimalist on purpose - 20 core ingredients instead of a shotgun blast. uses vegan algal dha and chelated magnesium, transparent supply chain if you're into traceability screenshots. keep in mind: excludes the whole b-complex and skips vitamin c entirely. see it as a diet insurance policy, not the whole policy. why magnesium and omega-3s stay underdosed everywhere multivitamins chase capsule count and price ceilings. meaningful magnesium needs \~250-400 mg elemental, which is bulky. dha/epa are oils that crowd out everything else. most brands punt those to stand-alone products. if your multi uses magnesium oxide (poor absorption) or brags ""fish-oil included"" but lists 100 mg, that's placeholder territory. plan to stack a mag glycinate or citrate plus a real fish-oil if those matter to you. quick lab cheat sheet before you buy check ferritin, d-25-hydroxy, b-12, and homocysteine at least once. knowing baseline stops blind stacking.

watch copper:zinc ratio if you run high-dose zinc for acne or immune bumps. unbalanced copper can tank energy.

if you're on trt or any hormone protocol, revisit vitamins a & d every six months - testosterone shifts how you store fat-solubles and trace minerals.

vegans / plant-leaners should tag on iodine and dha blood spots. most one-a-days don't shore those up enough.

dosing timing and gut friendliness split bigger servings - if your multi is a four-cap beast, two with breakfast, two with dinner typically cuts down nausea. take with fat - vitamins a, d, e, k ride on dietary fat. even half an avocado counts. coffee gap - caffeine can blunt mineral absorption. 30-minute buffer is usually plenty. watch calcium + iron combos - if you do take iron separately, avoid calcium-heavy meals at that time. they compete for the same transporters. common reddit myths worth poking ""food-based vitamins are always better."" reality: extraction isolates the same compounds. food blends can be gentler on digestion, but potency per capsule drops. pick based on gut tolerance, not marketing halos. ""more is safer because excess flushes out."" maybe true for some water-solubles, not for fat-solubles or minerals like selenium. lab work beats dose roulette. ""multis are snake oil if you eat ok."" nutrient databases look neat, but soil depletion, indoor jobs, and genetic quirks shift needs. a light insurance policy isn't crazy if dosing is sane. assembly line shopping flow i ended up using pick a formula iron-free, methyl-b heavy, and within budget tolerance.

tick off missing big hitters: magnesium, dha/epa, vitamin d (if under 1000 iu), maybe k2 mk-7.

calculate price per effective serving not per bottle. four-capsules-per-day bottles run out in three weeks, not a month.

set a 3-month reminder to re-check any blood markers you were chasing. keep what moved the needle, swap what didn't.

small note on alcohol carriers liquid or spray multis sometimes dissolve fat-solubles in ethanol. usually <5%, but if you avoid booze entirely, scan excipient lists or stick to capsules. multivitamins aren't magical armour, they're pothole filler. the two bottles up top (benevolent nourishment and biotics research) earned spots here by not low-balling key minerals, but any of the five could work if they line up with your diet gaps and budget. curious which combos folks here landed on, especially if you've juggled lab numbers over time - always down to see real-world tweaks rather than glossy brochure promises.",1,1764595867.0,u_Beginning_Zone_5152,0,1.0,False

1pbcp93,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1pbcp93/update_no_buy_november/,Update: No Buy November,"This is an update to my [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/1omle5l/no_buy_november/?ref=share&ref_source=link) earlier about not buying anything in the month of November. My idea was specifically to avoid Black Friday purchases but also to be more mindful when buying Christmas gifts. Here's how it went. 

Here is everything I bought in November:

* 11/2/25: $328.84, BikeFlights. This is a shipping service for bicycles. I sold a bike and shipped it to Texas. 

* 11/6/25: $21.71, groceries.

* 11/6/25: $187.63, dining out. Two people. 

* 11/7/25: $50.89, DoorDash. Flying out the next day, didn't want to cook. 

* 11/8/25: $32.66, airport food. They really know how to get you. 

* 11/8/25: $127.55, groceries. Staying with family but they have terrible coffee and no snacks. 

* 11/10/25: $269.80, dining out. Six people. I paid for the bill and they sent me money. 

* 11/10/25: $586.16, Apple Store. Christmas gift for my dad. iPhone 16e. More thoughts on this purchase below. 

* 11/11/25: $196.17, bike shop. Got a flat tire and needed to replace the tube. Of course, then I noticed how bald the tires were so I decided to replace the tires as well. 

* 11/11/25: $129.66, Lowe's. Bug traps, cleaning supplies. Reimbursed by family. Prepping for some family events. 

* 11/11/25: $226.84, Target. New TV. We accidentally broke the TV in the guest room. 

* 11/13/25: $371.03, dining out. 8 people, family birthday so treated them to special dinner. Partially reimbursed from siblings. 

* 11/15/25: $90, dining out. Mexican food, paid for my sister as well. 

* 11/16/25: $41.09, airport food, snacks. 

* 11/16/25: $113.32, parking fees at airport. This was actually the cheapest option for a week parking. 

* 11/17/25: $66.66, Lowe's. Tool for a project, spare house key. Having a house sitter coming for the holidays, realized we don't have any spare keys. The tool was a very specific socket wrench size. Debated whether I needed to buy it vs try to borrow it but it's for a semi regular maintenance task that I'll do a few times a year. Saves me a trip to the bike shop to have them do it, which not only saves me repair costs twice a year but saves some time. 

* 11/17/25: $130.97, groceries. 

* 11/19/25: $51.64, groceries. Always forget something. 

* 11/24/25: $55.48, DoorDash. Didn't feel like cooking with Thanksgiving coming up. 

* 11/25/25: $216.40, Sur La Table. Gift to sister and brother in law. Combo birthday/Christmas gift. They both have December birthdays, so this kind of covered everything. 

* 11/25/25: $172.35, Amazon. Christmas gift for my brother. 

* 11/25/25: $100.27, wine and champagne for Thanksgiving. 

* 11/26/25: $255.70, groceries. Big Thanksgiving dinner shopping trip. 

* 11/26/25: $770, fancy dinner. Yes, I know. But it was worth it. More below. 


This was all of our purchases in November apart from stuff like cell phone bill, utilities, gas. And this was a concerted effort. We probably cut out some unnecessary purchases either consciously or otherwise, which was the point. At the same time there were some purchases that could be argued against. 

Some of the gifts you could say we failed. Yes, I know, we bought an iPhone for my dad. Up until a year ago he didn't even have a phone. He shared my mom's which was annoying for lots of reasons. He would go off to run errands and either forget stuff or we'd want to add things and there was no way to reach him. Or he would do what he always does, run into somebody he knew and it would be hours later and we'd have no idea where he was. He's getting older and we'd worry. So we as a family kind of forced him to get a cell phone. But he was using an old flip phone and always struggled with it. So, since the rest of the family has iPhones we got him one. The 16e seemed like the cheapest option to get in the door with a phone that could last a while. And he's familiar with iPhones since that is what my mom has. We also like that we can turn on share my location so when he wanders off or gets distracted we know he's ok. 

Other thoughts. The super expensive dinner was at a Michelin star restaurant we've been wanting to try for years. Totally expensive but it was amazing and totally worth it. 

The bike purchases I'm ok with because they replaced consumable items.

The TV replacement was annoying because it probably could have gone without replacing but I felt bad and don't like leaving things in worse conditions that starting. 

Overall, I'm happy with the challenge because I didn't buy anything on Black Friday, and overall we cut back heavily on our purchases. It really made us think about every purchase. There were more than a few times where I was close to buying something but decided not to when I took a hard look at whether I needed it. Makes me realize how many stupid and useless purchases I've made in the past. Were we perfect? No. But I'm ok with that because nobody is perfect. And as they say, perfect is the enemy of the good. We don't have to be perfect to cut back and reduce. We don't have to be perfect to do our part and stop buying stupid stuff. And realizing that being good is an overall net positive.",3,1764595517.0,Anticonsumption,1,0.71,False
1pbcp4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/1pbcp4m/the_wish/,The wish,"Early dawn, were the sky is grey. The city started to function. In a few movements city was filled with horn sounds and pollution.

An old man named Jack) woke up, brushed his teeth. Took a bath. Wore a shirt along with a jacket and pants. Had his breakfast, took the door keys, and left the apartment.

When Jack was walking towards the church. He saw a beggar carrying his wife on his back and begging for a meal. Jack approached him and gave him money for purchasing the food.

 And asked him, “Hey man, I think you're carrying your wife for a long time, maybe you don’t have to beg. Maybe search for a solution so it wouldn’t be a burden for you.

Beggar replied, “Sir, I never thought of carrying my wife as a burden. Who would take care of my wife? It doesn’t matter how long I have to carry her. Till my final breath, I would carry her in my heart.

This made  Jack realize that his wife Esther is a lovable wife and a wonderful woman. When I woke up morning, she used to come near me, wake me up with her husky voice Hey Jake she whispered, her fingers in my hair Come on, wake up, Jake.

Then the beggar left the place with a smile. Jack realized that the time he spent with his family and his friends. When Jack was listening to the prayer. He saw man was so busy talking with someone and noticed that his mom wasn’t able to walk.

 Jack approached a man and told him that his mother is struggling to walk. The man replied ‘’Oh, I didn’t see, I was on a busy phone call with something important. Hey thank you for helping her it is not my mother it is my mother- in -law’’.

A flash, I thought about my mother, she used to ask me jake help me out to clean the kitchen utensils. I used to reply mom, I'm so busy on call, My mom gave “Oh god,” now I regret it.

Jack said ‘’My son, when we have something, we never know the value of it. But when it’s gone, there is nothing to feel about. This made the man furious and left the place, taking his mother-in-law.

Jack then went to the park and saw children playing with their families. At the time, the child’s mom was busy talking with her friends.

At the time the child fell, they started to bleed. Jack rushed to use his piece of cloth and stopped the bleeding. The child's mom saw the child and scolded her badly.

Jack said, “Please don’t scold the child, this is just part of everyone’s life; moreover, it was your fault that you didn’t notice her, you were busy chatting with your friends”.

The child's mom got furious and yelled at her child and slapped her child. Jack advised, “Whatever we do today will come back tomorrow”. Hey, old man, mind your business. She turned her face and left the place immediately.

Then Jack saw a pit there, he saw water, his face turned into a woman’s face, because he did the same is to son. Jack’s son's name James, One day James was playing with his toys suddenly a piece of lego blocks suddenly he stamps on the block he plunged on the floor he got nose bleeding that time jake was talking to friend through video chat, jack turned back and saw James situation instead of pacifying James, he started yelling at James. James got hurt very badly. Jake thinks what I did to my son was “Sorry, son, for yelling at you. Jack thought in his mind.   

Jack got up and started traveling home. While Jack was passing by, he saw an ambulance. When Jack saw the man realized that he was the one who didn’t care about his mother-in-law. Just crossing him.

With great pain, Jack carried forward to his home. When Jack went around midday. He started to prepare lunch at his home. Imagine he and his wife used to enjoy the day by dancing, singing, and chatting with each other. Until his wife died of a heart attack.

 He went to the garage to hop in the car, then he noticed his son's cycle. When James was 7 years he asked his father Can you teach me to cycle, dad ok, my son. When James was riding a cycle, Jake used to hold the cycle behind. Days passed, years gone. He finished his college. After a few years, my son was offered a fabulous job in another country, so he moved with his family to another country and settled there.

In the evening, Jack went to the coffee shop. He saw an old man across the road lying down on the platform. This made Jack realize that when his son left, Jack was alone in his apartment alone after his wife's death. It has been more than 5 years since he last saw his grandchildren.

Later, Jack went to visit his friend's grave, kept flowers on the ground for a while, then saw his friend's grave, Jack realized that he wasn’t just a friend also a brother.

Then Jack went to his son’s home after a long time. Jack rang the bell twice, then the maid came out and said that they had gone on vacation.

Jack went home to have his dinner, emotionally thinking about his family. Jack took an album of his family to see the photos one by one, and his tears came along.

Before Jack went to sleep, he prayed to god that my wish is to be with my family, especially with my grandchildren. There is nothing more that this old man need’s my lord.

When Jack went to sleep, imagining his family, his tears came along with his emotions inside his heart.

The next morning, when his son came from the vacation, his maid informed him that an old man named Jack) visited. Son was shocked. He immediately called his father. The phone was out of service.

He then went to his house. Then the neighbour replied Oh, you came in search of Jack, right? he passed away a few days back. This made Jack's son stunned.

The neighbour asked Are you his son James. James said yes. The neighbour gave a letter along with an album. James started to cry while receiving it.

The neighbour said My son, nothing is too late, just cease the movement. James, with a pleasing left the place and went home. When James started reading the letter, his tears came through his emotions.

  My dear James

 I am proud to have a nice son like you. It was my pleasure to journey with you. I considered myself a lucky person in the world. Even though I had everything in my life. I did know to keep it well in my life. I wish I had spent more time with you. My son, I know I have made terrible mistakes in my life. The reason I came home is to see my grandchildren and you for the last time. Because the doctor had told me that since I had cardio issues, I wouldn’t even make 2 months. Before my death, I wished to see you and my grandchildren. But I always wanted you to know I loved my family more than anything in my life.

With the tears, James hugged the letter.

Started my coffee journey a year back with a French Press and an electric kettle. I’d usually get the beans for french press from
Blue Tokai. 



I’m currently trying to upgrade, and have looked at a pour over, a pour over with goosneck kettle is still costing me 5-6k including pour over, filter paper, gooseneck kettle and other important things. 

A) should i add more money and go for Agaro Espresso machine at 9k? I can have espressos and try more milk based coffee as well. 

B) Should i buy these packages; for example pour over kit by Doppio. Or the Bean Co roasters (are their grinders any worthy?)

C) if in case you guys say i’d recommend individually, (I’m well aware the good manual grinders are worth 5-6k) i’d refrain from buying them for now and continue to get my coffee pre grinded.

1pbcngb,https://www.reddit.com/r/OvereatersAnonymous/comments/1pbcngb/i_am_lifelong_overeater/,I am Lifelong Overeater,"Hi, I am F56yo. My food addiction started in adolescence. I had a fat friend who was always chastised by her mother for eating too much. I was thin and could not understand how people gain weight. So to support her I said I will eat as she eats. And this is how it started. 

Soon I was sneaking with her eating bread sprinkled with sugar. Bags of candies when we could get them. Bags of cookies. We did not have our own money to buy bread and cookies, so we begged on the street for money “to call Mom”. Then we would go to bakery and buy a bag of cookies. It was sick. But then I was not in touch of the sick part. To me it was fun as we were on a hunt all the time, we had our secret, and it was tasty! I gained weight. 

This screwed me for life. I stopped eating good foods so I could afford calories of “what I liked”. In uni my friends used to give me candy for my “coffee-chocolate diet”. I was restricting but hate doing it as I needed to feed my addiction to overeating. At the time I was blind to it. 

I managed long periods of time when I was in healthy weight. This is only because I never gave up trying to lose weight and because I have strong willpower. But I was blind to my addiction. 

I developed other addictions: to nicotine, to alcohol, love addiction. Basically, my relationship with EVERYTHING was screwed. I was able to quit nicotine, alcohol, sugar (!), processed foods (!), BREAD (!). Still, I was addicted to overeating. I was overeating nuts and cheese. Or anything that was permitted on the diet plan I followed. I was still blind to my addiction to overeating. I thought I am addicted to certain foods instead. Not to overeating. 

This takes me to the current time. In summer 2025 I followed Dr. Esselstyn eating plan. For those who are not familiar with it: it is designed to lower cholesterol and prevent heart disease. In my 50s I wanted to find a way to eat so I would not get all the usual cluster: diabetes, Alzheimer’s, heart problems.  I was also exhausted from low carb high protein/fat diet. I was sick of eggs, chicken and salmon. Gag. 

Esselstyn recommended whole foods plant based eating with no oils. No animal food. No dairy. It is very low fat (less than 10% of daily calories). It allowed me finally fruits, veggies in abundance, I even ate bread again (ciabatta without added oils and sugar) AND weight melted off in six weeks from 145lbs (the lowest I could go on low carb) to 125lbs. I was speechless. I had bouts of energy I forgot I ever had. I was in love with eating again! I praised Dr.Esselstyn and God for the final cure from being overweight and being happy with my menu! (yes, at 145lbs I was overweight for my 166cm height). And at the same time I was STILL blind to my addiction to overeating. 

As I am typing up my history of overeating, I realise how pervasive it is. I forgot to tell that in my high school I brushed very close with anorexia by losing all interest in food for a while when I discovered a thrill of finding many friends after I dumped my fat friend (the one with whom I developed food addiction). For a while food stopped being interesting to me. I became thin. I got so excited of being thin that I overdid it and ate like a bird, I did chewing and running to the toilet to spit it out so my parents would believe I ate my omelette. I lost my period. This freaked me out right away, I did not tell anyone but started eating more. It was hard to balance food and I developed night eating. I would wake up in the middle of the night and go eat. It was bad. This night eating followed me for life. Only now I started understanding how I can control it. 

When I lost weight when following a low fat whole foods plant based plan, at the same time I had a very stressful life event (sick Mom). I worried my heart out. Which also for a while deflected my obsession with overeating. I hardly could swallow anything. But I was consuming industrial volumes of coffee and tea, feeding with caffeinated liquids my addictive desire for overeating.  I was blind to my addiction. 

When my Mom recovered, I was able to resume my life. Now in a smaller frame. Everyone was complimenting me on weight loss and looks. I continued following my vegan low fat lifestyle. 

However it was not working. My sleep was garbage. I was tired of eating and could not stop. I gained a few pounds. Not much but I knew I am spiraling out of control again. I wasn’t happy. I wanted to be able to rest. To find peace. But instead I was constantly looking for this one apple to fix me. I struggled with bread again. I removed bread again. I started having cravings for desserts. The first time after July. Thanksgiving was hell for me. 

It was yesterday when I totally “lost it” and knew I must find a solution. I was looking into BED. I was sooo confused. My research brought me the book of Gillian Riley “Eating Less”. This book does not exist in audiobooks. I bought kindle format. 

OMG. 

Yes. Yes. And YES. This is it. This book for the first time showed me my problem. Addiction to OVEREATING. Not to certain foods. Yes, removing addictive foods (wheat) helps, but doesn’t resolve the nature of addiction. I actually believe that my smoking addiction (15+ years clean) and my alcohol addiction (1.5 years clean) are derivatives of my Primary Addiction- addiction to overeating. 

Guys, read this book! 

The book provided me with the tools to start working on my addiction. Many of those tools I already intuitively implemented (getting rid of processed foods, sugar, wheat, dairy). But what made sense to me were these two tools : Times and Plans. Decide what time next food intake will be (>1 hours from the last one) - Times. Decide what exactly this food will be - Plans. And stick to it. If you get uncomfortable during waiting for the meal time - it is addiction talking. By overcoming it we lessen it. By having Time and Plan to eat, there is no panic. 

I did it last night. I ate (addictive) an orange at 3:30pm and right after I read about Times and Plans. I decided that my next and final meal will be at 6:30pm. I decided what it will be - cooked buckwheat mixed with freshly salad, sweet potato and one orange. I got uncomfortable at 5:30pm and started looking at my watch all the time. This was addiction manifesting itself. But now I was equipped with my realisation and I picked up my knitting, petted my cat and by the time I remembered about eating it was 6:37pm! I went to the kitchen and ate my buckwheat with salad, only one tiny sweet potato and I did not want the orange. I was full. My next Plan was to drink my coffee in the morning. 

Guys, I slept peacefully for the first time in ages. My heart was calm. I knew what I was doing. 

There is hope! It is only Day 2 for me. I am still pissed I wasted my Thanksgiving Holiday on my addiction but I am HAPPY to finally come out of denial. 

Thank you for reading. It was important for me to write my story.

Just 40 minutes north of Jonesboro, Arkansas, the extremist compound known as Return to the Land (RTTL) has now openly confirmed what everyone already suspected: they’re actually rejecting housing applicants based on race.Yes, you read that correctly. Not 1955. Not a history book. Arkansas, 2025.

For those who haven’t been following this saga of backwoods authoritarian cosplay: RTTL has been widely described as a neo-Nazi - aligned enclave in Ravenden, where leadership appears intent on resurrecting Jim Crow–style housing policies  -  complete with barring Jews and non-White applicants.

They’ve been in the national spotlight for months. CNN, MSNBC  -  you name it.


And through it all, we’ve had to endure Eric Orwoll’s media performances: a potent cocktail of virtue signaling, revisionist history, and creative storytelling.

What the media rarely bothers to mention is that both co-founders carry highly controversial histories - THEY ARE BOTH SCAM ARTISTS running an illegal land scam. 

Eric Orwoll: a pornographer, failed unemployed musician, grifter, drug addict and a polygamist who, despite his elitist education, has never held a career - he now lectures America on family values. 

Peter Csere: another unemployed scam artist, failed musician, who fled Ecuador with an outstanding attempted murder warrant  - also accused by two of his communities for embezzling funds and destroying accounting records prior to fleeing Ecuador. Another ""exemplary"" citizen telling us what's wrong with America, and how he could fix it. 

Folks, living solely off the charitable donations handed to them by other Neo-Nazis, these are the men overseeing real estate and money decisions in Arkansas in 2025.🤣🤣
Truly inspiring leadership, no? 

Multiple complaints already filed for illegal sale of unregistered securities and FHA Violations. 

Meanwhile, Arkansas authorities have been repeating the same tired script:


“We’re looking into it… no non-White applicants have applied or been rejected… nothing to see here…”

Well, on November 26, that excuse went up in smoke thanks to two tweets from RTTL’s self-appointed Grand Poobah, who essentially confirmed the racial gatekeeping everyone has been warning about.

Full report:
https://nexiswirereport.substack.com/p/after-months-of-silence-a-single

So here’s the real question:

How much longer is the government going to pretend this isn’t happening?
Apparently, the exclusion of minorities wasn’t enough to motivate action. Governor Sarah Huckabee and her AG Griffin couldn't care less about minorities being denied housing - and its' clear. 


But now that Orwoll is reportedly rejecting White men for having Hispanic or Asian wives, will that finally get someone in power to look up from their coffee?

Or will Arkansas simply continue treating RTTL like a quirky backwoods HOA instead of what it is  -  a stain on the state and a massive embarrassment to the country?

now that the Whites are being denied housing, will Governor Huckabee finally step in and end this grift???

A mindset driven by iteration, learning, user feedback, and a strong focus on product quality.

In this article, I want to share how we approached building Bealariq Coffee using principles familiar to developers and product builders.

https://preview.redd.it/lqxg11yjfl4g1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e01a19ab97330d142b62a8cb99ce783e5615b5e

# 1. Start With the Core: The Product Itself

Before the brand, the visuals, or the marketing, we focused on one thing:  
**a clean, natural, high-quality coffee experience.**

Just like building a minimal viable product (MVP):

* We defined our core value: *pure and balanced coffee*,
* Collected user feedback from early testers,
* And improved our roast profiles based on real experience.

Product first. Always.



# 2. Iterate Like a Developer

Creating a coffee brand requires the same approach as shipping a digital product:

* Start small
* Improve quickly
* Ship often
* Listen to your users

From packaging design to roast profiles, each step went through multiple iterations.  
Every customer review was treated like a GitHub issue — something to refine and improve.



# 3. User Experience Matters (Even for Coffee)

UX isn’t only for apps.  
A coffee brand also delivers an experience:

* Ordering flow
* Packaging feel
* Aroma when opening the bag
* Brewing instructions
* Branding consistency

Each interaction point builds the user’s perception of the product, exactly like UI/UX in software.



# 4. Branding = Clear Communication

Developers love clarity.  
Customers too.

Bealariq Coffee uses simple messaging:

* No exaggerated claims
* No artificial stories
* Just high-quality, naturally processed coffee with honesty

Authentic communication builds trust — in software and in coffee.



# 5. Building in Public

One of the most powerful approaches in tech is transparency.

We started sharing:

* Our roasting tests
* Packaging drafts
* Coffee farm visuals
* Behind-the-scenes stories
* Blog posts and Medium articles

This helped create early-stage supporters — people who love the product *because they saw it being built*.



# Conclusion

Bealariq Coffee is more than a coffee brand — it’s a product built with the discipline of a developer, the vision of a maker, and the authenticity of a craftsman.

If you’re building something — whether it's coffee, software, or a digital product — the principles are the same:

* Start simple
* Iterate fast
* Listen deeply
* Deliver consistently

And always stay true to your product.",1,1764595229.0,u_Every-Elevator-6526,0,1.0,False

Hi Reddit, I (66F) am a widow living in the suburban home my late husband and I built 30 years ago. It’s a 4-bedroom house, paid off, and filled with memories.

Last week, my son ""Ryan"" (40M) and his wife ""Laura"" (38F) came over for dinner. I made a pot roast, thinking we were just catching up. But the moment dinner was over, Ryan pulled out a shiny business portfolio.

They pitched me a ""logistics startup"" idea. I’m a retired accountant, and honestly? It was garbage. No revenue plan, just hype. But then came the ask.

Laura smiled that fake, tight smile and said, ""Mom, we need the seed capital. We’ve run the numbers. You need to sell this house. It’s too big for you. You’re just one person hoarding all this space.""

I was stunned. I tried to argue that this is my home, my security.

Then Ryan said the thing I can’t get out of my head. He sighed, poured himself a glass of my expensive wine without asking, and said:

**""Face it, Mom. You’re old. You don't need an asset like this anymore. You’ll probably die soon anyway, or end up in a home. Why not cash out now and fund our dreams so we can build a legacy? Don't be selfish with 'dead money'.""**

*You'll die soon anyway.*

I didn't scream. I just went numb. I told them I’d ""think about it."" They left looking smug, thinking they had won. Ryan has been texting me listing agents ever since.

I feel like an ATM, not a mother. But his words woke me up. He’s right about one thing: I shouldn't be hoarding this asset.



# Update 1: ""I did exactly what he asked. I sold the house.""



**Posted:** November 17, 2025

Thanks for the support on the last post. Reading your comments made me realize that if I keep this house, they will just wait for me to die to get it.

So, I did what Ryan asked. I sold it.

But I didn't use his realtor. I called an old friend of mine in real estate and told her: ""I want out. Quick sale. Cash buyer. Investor only. No sign in the yard.""

Because the market is hot, an investment LLC made a cash offer within 48 hours. We closed in 7 days. The money—$580,000—hit my account this morning.

I have spent the last week quietly purging 30 years of stuff. I donated furniture, threw away junk, and packed only two suitcases. Ryan texted me yesterday asking if I had signed the listing agreement yet.

I replied: *""Come over Friday night. We’ll celebrate. I have a surprise for you.""*

He responded with party popper emojis. He thinks the ""surprise"" is me agreeing to list the house. He has no idea the house already belongs to a corporation in Chicago, and the locks are being changed Saturday at noon.

I am terrified, but I have never felt more alive.



# Update 2: ""The Celebration Dinner turned into a Reality Check.""



**Posted:** November 22, 2025

It is done.

Ryan and Laura arrived at the house at 6 PM. They brought cheap champagne. When they walked in, they froze.

The house was completely empty. No dining table, no sofa, no pictures on the walls. Just three metal folding chairs I set up in the middle of the empty living room.

""Whoa,"" Ryan said, looking around. ""Did you… did you stage the house already? That was fast!""

""Sit down,"" I said.

They sat on the folding chairs, looking confused but excited. Laura was practically vibrating. She asked, ""So, did you sign with the realtor? When does it go on the market?""

I stood up and handed Ryan a single sheet of paper. It was the Settlement Statement.

""I didn't list it,"" I said calmly. ""I sold it. The deal closed two days ago. The money is in my bank account.""

For a second, there was total silence. Then, absolute chaos. Ryan jumped up, cheering. Laura started crying tears of joy. ""Oh my god, Martha! You actually did it! $580,000? We can fund the seed round AND pay ourselves a salary!""

Ryan looked at me with greedy eyes and said, ""Okay, so how do we transfer it? Wire? Or did you write a check?""

I reached into my blazer pocket. I pulled out a folded piece of paper.

""Ryan,"" I said. ""You told me to sell the house to fund a dream. You were right. I was holding onto a past that didn't exist anymore.""

I handed him the paper. He grabbed it, expecting a check.

It was my travel itinerary.

""I am funding *my* dream,"" I said. ""Tomorrow morning, I fly First Class to Paris. Then Rome. Then Bali. I booked a round-the-world trip. One way.""

Ryan stared at the paper like it was written in alien hieroglyphics. ""What? You’re… spending it? But that’s *our* inheritance!""

""I’m not dead yet, remember?"" I smiled. ""Like you said, I might die soon. I better enjoy this money while I can.""

Then came the meltdown. Laura started screaming that I was senile and selfish. But Ryan… Ryan turned pale. He dropped onto the folding chair and put his head in his hands.

""Mom,"" he whispered. **""I quit my job yesterday.""**

I honestly almost laughed. ""You what?""

""I quit!"" he yelled. ""I put in my notice because I knew the funding was coming! You destroyed us!""

""No, Ryan,"" I said, picking up my suitcase. ""You destroyed yourself with your own entitlement. The house is sold. The new owners change the locks tomorrow at noon. I suggest you leave.""

I walked out to my waiting Uber. I didn't look back.



# Final Update: ""Views from Paris""



**Posted:** November 28, 2025

I am writing this from a small café in Le Marais, Paris. I am eating a croissant that costs 4 Euros and tastes like heaven.

My phone has been blowing up for days. Ryan is begging. Laura is threatening to sue me for ""elderly incompetence"" (my lawyer says good luck with that).

I sent them one final text before I blocked their numbers:

*""I have set up a trust fund for your children’s education. You cannot touch it. As for the rest of the money? I am going to spend every cent enjoying the life I put on hold to raise an ungrateful son. Find your own way.""*

I am sipping my coffee, watching the rain fall on the streets of Paris. I am alone, but for the first time in years, I am not lonely.

Ryan is homeless (or close to it) because of his own greed. I am homeless because I am free.

I think I made the right choice.

**Editor’s note:**

For anyone who wants to hear the full emotion of this story, there is a narrated version available here:

1pbcd9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestOfAmazonHQ/comments/1pbcd9a/title_best_compact_juicer_out_there_on_a_budget/,TITLE: Best compact juicer out there (on a budget),"So I’ve been slowly dragging myself toward healthier choices (trying not to live on iced coffee),
and a proper juicer was on the list for FOREVER. Problem was, most cold press juicers are
either gigantic or cost more than my weekly grocery budget(im a college student btw).

I checked walmart and target but god the stuff there is expensive af so i came back to good old
amazon lol. Found [this compact kind](https://d3oc4tmn8qmbnq.cloudfront.net/?q=GMKAO648)
from inoviva and it lowkey surprised me compared to most others I saw. It’s small like
fits-in-a-tote small but the blades do the job way better than I'd expect from that price. (huge
plus: it comes in the prettiest pink shade)

Also a side note, I had a mini juicer back when I started college and thought it’d be enough, but
it was way too compact to make a good serving. Ended up juicing 3x just to fill one glass. So I
learned my lesson, juicer needs to be compact but still big enough to give a full big glass.

Compared to my last, here's what i think is better in this one:
* compact and lightweight, works well for small kitchens or carrying it around

* 70 rpm slow juicing so it doesn’t kill nutrients (less foamy juice too)-very important imo

* barely any pulp waste

* easy to clean, everything clicks apart (and dishwasher safe)

Not saying it’s going to outdo a $300 nama juicer, but for the price (under $40), it’s honestly a
great intro if you’re just starting with juicing or want something portable for travel, small spaces,
or even dorm life.",1,1764594601.0,BestOfAmazonHQ,0,1.0,False
1pbccvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TimHortons/comments/1pbccvy/off_to_a_bad_start/,Off to a bad start..,"I have an exam today so I thought if grab some Tim's on the way. Ordered a coffee, it came black when I ordered with cream. That's fine, no big deal.
But I also ordered a egg and cheese wrap and started eating it while waiting for the bus. Suddenly I taste something different and tucked neatly into the wrap I see several strips of bacon.
I feel awful for eating it, because I'm Muslim and don't eat pork, but more so that I just wasted so much food. I wish I had opened up the wrap to see but no my hungry ahh had to start munching away and I only notice when I'm halfway in.
I would have given it to someone who would have wanted the food..

(Also I couldn't have went back to get my order changed since I ran outside to the bus stop immediately to catch a bus, and the stop is a few mins away, not right outside the tims)

Anyways I'm still hungry and need a pick me up. Have you guys eaten Tim's bacon and lived to tell the tale?

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)

No picks this week, as I had to take over list duties from /u/TELMxWILSON, who is currently waking up at 6:00am, learning how to assemble a rifle and how to blend in with the snow - or whatever you do during Finnish army training. We should be back to normal next week though!

Here is a small sample. I want a sincere review on the language. I’m not an English native speaker. 
Thanks. 



She lit the stove, put water for coffee, and sat opposite me—the same chair where she had beaten me hours earlier.

I waited for the screaming to start again.
It never came.
Instead she stared at the cracked table and spoke so quietly I had to lean in.

“Your grandfather crossed a river once,” she said. 

“January. Forty-nine below. The guards shot the dogs first so the barking wouldn’t carry. He walked on the bodies of men who had fallen before him. Ice broke. Water took his boots, then his toes, one by one. When he reached the other side he had no feeling left below the knees, but he kept walking because the Russians were still behind.”

She stirred the coffee and let her gaze drift toward the Black Sea through the thin window.

“He came home in 1954. Skinny, grey, eyes like holes. The first night he slept in his own bed he woke screaming that the guards were dragging him back. My mother tried to calm him. He beat her unconscious with the same fists that had carried him across the ice. Said if she was soft the Russians would smell it on her and come for all of us.”

She looked at me then. Really looked.

“I was seven. He made me stand in the yard in February with no coat until I stopped crying. Said tears freeze and give your position away. When I came inside he beat me with the belt for shivering too loud. Every time I flinched he said, ‘Good. Remember this feeling. It will keep you alive.’”

The coffee boiled over. She didn’t move.

“That is what they taught him in the camp. Pain is a language. If you speak it first, nobody can use it on you.”

She tapped the spoon against the cup. Tap. Tap. Tap. Like bones.

“I thought I was teaching you to survive,” she whispered. “I thought if I made you hard enough, the world would leave you alone.”

Her voice cracked on the last word. Not tears—she had none left. Just the sound of something inside her finally breaking after forty years.

“I was wrong,” she said. “The world doesn’t leave you alone. It just waits until you’re the one holding the pipe.”

She stood, walked to the window, and stared out at the grey blocks, the laundry lines, and the red star still painted on the water tower even though nobody believed in it anymore.

“Go to your room,” she said without turning. “Your father will say what needs to be said when he comes home tonight.”

Can anyone recommend like a decent, not too pricey space for 8 people? 

Most hotels, meeting rooms etc are ranging like AED 1,500-2000+ per day without food. This is out of budget for us. 

Im just looking for a comfortable private space. 

Any recommendations or favorites? Im thinking coffee shops with maybe a meeting room?

On the fourth night, I woke up to the sound of whispering. I couldn’t understand the words, but it was definitely a voice—right behind the wall that my bed is pushed against. I didn’t sleep the rest of the night.

I asked the neighbor who lives on the other side of that wall if he’d heard anything strange. He looked at me like I’d just asked whether gravity was working today. He said that unit has been empty for months. No one lives there. No one should be making noise.

Two days ago, I came home from work and noticed a long, thin crack running down the wall by my bedroom door. I pressed my ear against it and I swear… I heard breathing. Slow. Rhythmic. Like something was waiting on the other side.

Last night was the worst.

At around 1:40 AM, I heard tapping—three taps—then silence. Then three taps again, but closer. I turned on my phone flashlight, and there it was: a bulge in the paint, like something was pushing from the inside.

And then the whispering started again.

This time, I could make out one word:

“…hello…”

I didn’t sleep. I haven’t slept at all today. I’m writing this from a coffee shop because I’m honestly scared to go back.

Whatever is living in the walls… it knows I can hear it now.

And I think it wants to come out.",1,1764593764.0,u_Vast-Abalone5958,0,1.0,False

Cybersecurity GPS: Navigating Risks, Compliance & Resilience in the Auto Ecosystem","If you’ve been waiting for a no-BS cybersecurity discussion, it’s finally happening this Friday.

The Qut – Episode 3: Cybersecurity GPS is going live on YouTube.

No slides. No corporate jargon. Just an honest conversation about dealing with real-world threats, risks, and compliance chaos.

If you work in cybersecurity, IT, or operations or you just want practical insights instead of marketing fluff, this is worth tuning in for.

Live this Friday. Bring your coffee ☕ and join the discussion.

I have a Gaggia Coffee Classic from the year 2000, and I’m considering replacing the original pump with a pump from a Saeco Aroma, as it is noticeably quieter.

Does anyone know if this pump is compatible with the Gaggia Coffee Classic?
Has anyone already tried this swap or has experience with it?

Any advice, photos, or wiring tips would be greatly appreciated!

1pbc02d,https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioLiquor/comments/1pbc02d/new_and_changed_products_december_2025_mostly/,New and Changed Products - December 2025 - Mostly price decreases,"Usually around the first of the month we have a batch of price changes and this also tends to be when other product changes are made in the system. According to the ""[How to Become a Contract Liquor Agent](https://www.com.ohio.gov/documents/liqr_8041.pdf)"" document, ""The Agent must also complete price changes that occur at the first of the month...""

A similar mix of changes happened in December of *last year* too, with mostly price decreases with a few new products added as well. See [New and Changed Products - December 2024 - A few price decreases and new products](https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioLiquor/comments/1h5ejar/new_and_changed_products_december_2024_a_few/)

Counts for 12/1/2025:

* Number of Price Decreases: 	87 (Average decrease per fl oz: $0.24)
* Number of New Products: 	22
* Number of Price Increases: 	3 (Average increase per fl oz: $0.14)
* Number of Status Changes: 	5 (0 are to De-Listed)


For each category I've sorted by the amount of the price increase or decrease. New products are shown first, then price decreases are shown in decreasing order followed by price increases in increasing order. At the end are products with other changes unrelated to price.

I plan to use this post to capture other smaller changes that happen during the rest of the month before the big change next month.

Here is the link to what changed last month in [November, 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioLiquor/comments/1olnqzs/new_and_changed_products_november_2025_mostly/). Be sure to take a look at the [sticky comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/OhioLiquor/comments/1olnqzs/comment/nro10dy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) with changes that happened throughout the month after the 1st.

Current product status is indicated on each line as follows. OHLQ hasn't publicly explained what these things mean but I've included my best guess below.

* A = Active
 * Regularly supplied and available for purchase
* D = De-Listed
 * No longer carried by OHLQ, may still be available in some stores or the warehouse. Sometimes considered a Last Call product
* I = Inactive
 * Discontinued by the supplier or otherwise unavailable to OHLQ
* S = Special Order
 * Regularly available but in limited supply. Not available in very many stores
* V = Value-Added-Pack
 * Bottle comes with some kind of extra gift like a glass/mug/etc

1pbbywf,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1pbbywf/being_trans_peoplepleasing_and_defining_a_new_name/,"Being trans, people-pleasing, and defining a new name","First person I heard use my name was the cashier at the Williamsburg Taco Bell, handing me the thanksgiving dinner that I ate alone amongst the chosen family of Uber drivers taking their break in silence.

I wanted to test it, see what it would be like to hear someone say that name aloud. Why I would choose a name that a good amount of people can’t pronounce (He was close, he handed me my order yelling “Sire!” A feast for a king), was my first thought. I’ve spent most of my life trying to take up as little space as possible, and now having to constantly advocate for the pronunciation of my new name every time I interact with someone seemed daunting. 

Everything is very black-and-white in the worlds that I’ve occupied. Man or Woman. Hot or Ugly. Good or Bad. Simple or Difficult. As I have taken on (or really, unintentionally assumed) the role of leader in my work life, I’ve tried as much as possible to be perceived as a “Good” and “Simple” person to make others happy (and make my life easier, really). I haven’t always been good. I’ve made mistakes, hurt people, learned lessons too late, etc. And I’m probably “difficult” sometimes (And I mean shit even when I’m not trying to be “difficult,” my autism, Blackness, or some secret third thing makes me perceived as such). But in a world lacking any nuance, I’ve strived towards the path of least resistance — I’m the good guy. I’m a normal, easy-to-work-with person that can sit in the good, wholesome, productive leader box. Until I’m not, then I’m ripped apart, externally and internally, till I can figure out how to get back in my box. 

I think that’s one of the many reasons I like to keep my gender simple and uncomplicated. Taking the path of least resistance. I got the “girl” label and there’s no need to make things troublesome for me or anyone else to change it. Change my email address, websites, organization paperwork, re-introduce myself to professional connections, and more things I haven’t even begun to think of? A headache. Come out to my family in the south? As Trans, AND gay? Hilarious. I’ve got other things to worry about. And it’s not even that uncomfortable. Barely even think about it most days. Gender? That’s other people’s business. I just wear the clothes I got from my mom that I still have from high-school, the random floral Buc-ee’s shirt I got as a gift, the James Blake t-shirts I’ve almost disintegrated from an unknown number of washes, the crop-tops and booty-shorts from that one old white dude I dated (free clothes, how can I complain?). I sport the face I was born with. She/Her? Like half the people I know use those pronouns. It’s very simple, really.

Recently though, I realized it might not be best to revolve my life around people pleasing. Through some meditation, through books, through writing, I’ve found myself faced with unbearable confusion and anxiety in my journey of self-discovery. Why I can stand on a stage in-front of a hundred or so people and yap about work just fine, but lapped around the block 5 times trying to enter a gay bar before giving up, is beyond me (Where did I go after giving up? You guessed it, to the Taco Bell). There’s something indescribably terrifying exiting out of the box of normalcy, conformity, and the routine of being the good, simple, non-intrusive person.

\_\_\_\_

I remember in middle school being afraid to walk in this specific area in the hallway during passing period, because they had these full size mirrors I could see my reflection in. I assumed the unbearable discomfort it brought was because I was “ugly.” And that reminder was depressing, so I avoided it. For a multitude of reasons (Being in predominantly white spaces, not knowing how to do my hair, being undiagnosed Autistic, puberty, being taller than literally everyone including teachers, and so on), I was uncomfortable in my body and being perceived by other people. I assumed “ugly and awkward” as my diagnosis and as the reasoning for my later realized gender and neurotype discomforts.

It was in high-school, when I found my first set of older boyfriends I met online through Minecraft, that I learned that I had something that was desired: femininity. I spent many years attaching my value to the aspects of “womanhood” that were desired by others. My only close relationships were boyfriends, and I was only valued as someone’s “girlfriend.” I wasn’t ugly anymore, and I could get used to what was in the mirror. It couldn’t be that bad? I had something to be happy about, apparently. 

I’m not sure when I first entertained the idea of being trans. I have on a hard-drive somewhere pictures of me in a button up, jeans, and wearing 2 sports bras, sometime in undergrad, just to see what it would feel like to look like that. I remember thinking I looked so ridiculous. I think it’s because those clothes didn’t fit, I could still very clearly see my feminine figure in those skinny jeans, and I had (have) horrendous selfie game. 

I thought about being trans in middle school and high school as well. It’s been on and off throughout much of my post-pubescent life. I remember contemplating and eventually brushing off those thoughts because “I only wanted to be a guy because of trauma,” or something. I hated being perceived as feminine by men, and I hated all the objectification that comes from that. I hated not being able to be friends with and love men without them sexualizing that. And I didn’t want to change gender based on all the societal things that are put on women. I didn’t think that’s why \*actual\* trans people transition.

But I also hate feeling weird around women, feeling like the odd one out. I’ve always wanted to be friends with women, but I’ve felt like an intruder in any group of women I’m in, and I didn’t really have a label for it and didn’t want to explore that embarrassing “I’m not like other girls” feeling. I hate women’s clothes, and I hated feeling weird in the men’s clothing section in Texas, prepping the “I’m shopping for my friend” line I had stashed in case someone asks. I hate my round face in the mirror. I hate having an objectively “good” singing voice, but still hating how it sounded.

I loved the idea of being friends with and having loving relationships with other women as a man. And I loved the thought of being a man loving other men. Not romantic love; I like the idea of being a warm, friendly presence. I feel like “me” on the outside isn’t emanating the “me” on the inside that wants to be that presence with other people. The idea of exploring who I am from a different body — not reserved, unabashedly me, exploring masculinity and even femininity from a “male” slate —made me feel like I could finally not be terrified trying to be seen around people. And I started to shed the ideas of what \*actual\* trans people do and come up with my own reasons for doing.

And I hated my old name. Too feminine sounding. Never liked it. I went by a masc nickname to all my online friends growing up. And now, I loved the thought of finally getting a new name. 

\_\_\_\_

“I can’t do another white name” was my first thought (my birth name is, very white, even though neither parent is). I landed on Trevon. Played with that for a bit. Felt too much like a “name” though. Not sure how to describe that feeling, but that “that’s a name other people have” feeling. I’ve known at least a couple “Trevons/Treys.” I’m not sure if I’m a Trey, too. I was on the phone with my ex, the first person I came out to, as we browsed the list of baby names we would never have (tragic). I played with some names I came across, names I liked the sound of, creating hybrid names (Is that allowed, I thought?). After some playing around in a notes app the day after at some coffee shop on the UES, arrived on Sy’Aire.

Don’t think I’ve ever known anyone with that name, after some Google searches I found it on other baby-name sites, even a ""how to pronounce” YouTube video of its own. It felt very new, “airy”, freeing. I like writing it “syaire” but the capitalization and apostrophe I felt might make it easier to pronounce (I was wrong). Doesn’t have a meaning according to Google. No origin other than being a combination or alternative to other related names. Did I need an origin story? I didn’t know the meaning of my birth name until I Googled it just now actually. Could I create my own meaning? Again… is this allowed?? I panicked as if the name police would come and force me to pick Steve or Kyle or something (and apologies to the Steve and Kyle’s of the world, or anyone else with popular male names, it’s not you, it’s me).

For the next few weeks after, I was “Sy’Aire” in my head. In the Tinder profile I kept impulsively creating and deleting. In my Taco Bell orders. 

New clothes were easy. Fun, even. I never liked femme clothing. Baggy clothes, neutral colors, that felt like me. Big t-shirts, undershirts, great. Boxers? Not there yet, and honestly panties (And let’s pause to say I never liked that word, ever. We need a new gender neutral or just less freaky word for those things. “Panties” for me is my “moist,” I just hate it.) work just fine.

Pronouns were another thing. He/They feels good enough for now. It’s really hard to tell what I want here. Again, I feel like this is an “other people” thing. I’m realizing the discomfort I’ve gotten in the past from accidentally being Sir’d or He'd (I’m abnormally tall, it’s a common mistake until people see my face) is mostly because then they see my face, they do the “Oh! Uh… Ma’am? Sorry,” and it’s awkward and I feel uncomfortable because they’re uncomfortable. “She” honestly feels fine, but if I’m going for \*boy\* then maybe we should retire that one. “He” is a little jarring (I think mostly due to that “oops this is about to be awkward” realization) but maybe I’ll get used to it. “They” is fine but it feels a bit impersonal. And I honestly don’t trust myself at the moment to stick to any neo-pronouns (I keep accidentally mis-pronouning myself and have deadnamed myself like 4 times today).

Female to what, though? Still unsure. Male seems fine. I’m trying to go beyond “fine” though. Fine shouldn’t be my standard anymore. I should probably at least attempt to figure out these things about myself. Still trying to get there though. Still trying to figure out a lot of things actually. Had to phone my cis ex again, to figure out the name of those pants that I like that I see guys wear. “Chinos,” apparently. Not knowing how to dress myself or the names of clothing items I like is apparently, very male. 

Anyways, it’s sigh-AIR. Same amount of syllables as my last name, actually. Really it’s not that hard. And I would like to create my own definition(s) for this name:

sy·​aire

Shopping + beauty treatments + sightseeing all packed in,"I tried to squeeze in everything like sightseeing, shopping and even a little beauty maintenance which it turned into a very busy but super satisfying 4 day trip.

I stayed at Signiel Busan and it was the best hotel i’ve been to. It has this coastal luxury vibe that you don’t really get in Seoul, so splurging on it felt totally worth it.

For sightseeing, I started with the Haeundae Blueline Park train and sky capsule, which take you along the coastline with amazing views. Then I visited Haedong Yong gungsa temple, an oceanside temple where the sound of waves literally hits the steps as you walk, really peaceful and unique. 

I also stopped by Gamcheon village, the colorful hillside neighborhood full of murals and tiny shops which was a bit touristy but still fun to explore. After that, I went to Huinnyeoul village, which felt calmer and had tons of views and little cafes built along the cliff.

I also walked around Dongbaek island, which has one of the prettiest coastal trails in Busan and is full of camellias in winter.

A friend also took me to Dalmaji Hill and we ended up eating at a place called Haeundae giwajip daegutang. It was my first time having that rich cod soup and it was unbelievably good. If you’re a coffee person, definitely stop by Momos Coffee in Haeundae, the view and the coffee both lived up to the hype.

For shopping, I went to Shinsegae Centum City because everyone kept saying how huge it is and they weren’t kidding. I hit the duty free section and stocked up on Sulwhasoo, Mediheal packs, and a bunch of skincare since the exchange rate was pretty decent. I also checked out Spa Land inside the mall. I added a 50,000 KRW 40 min well being massage and it was so relaxing I wished I had booked a longer one. If you go, make sure to reserve your slot as soon as you arrive and spend about 20 minutes in the bath beforehand, apparently it helps warm up your body for the massage.

The day before I left, I wanted to fit in one more treat myself moment so I went to Jryn Clinic for ultherapy prime. I did 600 shots for 1.8M KRW (pretty sure tax wasn’t included). They were thorough with the treatment and I left feeling noticeably firmer around my face. Now all the sheet masks I bought at duty free are officially part of my aftercare routine.

After thinking about posting this on Reddit for a while, I finally decided to share a little bit about my story because I need to hear from people who are knowledgeable about the subject to feel calmer and more included :)

About three weeks ago, I drank a little more coffee than I'm used to. 

I'll explain briefly: I used to drink capsule coffee (Nespresso) and always mixed more milk than coffee. But on that day, my family made instant coffee, and not only did I drink half a cup of it without milk or anything else to dilute the caffeine concentration, but I also drank the rest of the pot, which was SUUUPER concentrated. An hour later, I started to feel my heart racing, I felt very strange, and I had involuntary movements. Since I didn't know what was happening, I got really scared, and to make sure it wasn't anything serious, I went to the emergency room, but by the time I got there, the peak had already passed. They examined me and listened to everything, and everything seemed minimally normal, so they sent me home.  after that day, I never felt anything like that again.

But the weeks after that day, I spent the whole week with a heavy feeling in my chest, it felt like I wasn't breathing in enough air, you know? “Filling a void with nothing” was the phrase my mother used to describe the symptom, and I can even understand it! I think that's exactly what it is. So much so that one night I was so fed up with it not going away that I went to the emergency room to get it checked out and confirm everything! They did an electrocardiogram, the results were normal and healthy, and a chest X-ray, everything was normal. I remember that night when my dad took me to the hospital, I can say it was the first time I was aware that I was close to a panic attack, but I don't know if it really was or not because I've NEVER FELT ANYTHING LIKE THIS (since I've never felt it, I don't know if this is actually something organic and serious, you know?). On the way there that night, I was really anxious, and if you ask me why, I think it was because I was going to the hospital, I was scared and afraid.

As time went by, that feeling eased, but it never completely went away! Until today, when in a few weeks it will be a month since that event with the coffee. I went to my pediatrician and he tried to reassure me that it must be anxiety and even took the usual measurements and everything was normal, once again.

But because this isn't going away, and worse, because I don’t even think about this whole situation, I'm still like this! Do you understand? I don't think about anything, and I'm like this most of the day, sometimes it goes away and other times it comes back. But the thing is, it's not going away :( I'm just a little worried that it might be something more serious, you know? Because I've never felt anxiety like this before, and since I'm unsure and it's not going away, I'm always uncertain.

What do you think? do you guys have any advice?",1,1764593271.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False
1pbbvp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/malelivingspace/comments/1pbbvp0/lshaped_livingdining_room_layout_help/,L-shaped Living/Dining Room Layout Help,"Hey,

I'm looking for some layout advice for my L-shaped living and small dining room. I've got a floor plan with dimensions, and a specific list of furniture I need to fit in.

The room has a wood stove in the top right corner and a sliding door (for garden/balcony access). All windows are at a 1m elevation from the floor, so I can place furniture directly against the walls if needed without blocking light.

**Here's what I need to include:**

* **Dining Space:** A small round table for 4 people.
* **Living Space:**
   * Coffee table
   * Club leather sofa (2-seat)
   * Club leather chair (1-seat)
   * 2 modern fireside chairs

I'm trying to create two distinct zones – a dining area and a living/conversation area. My main challenges are dealing with the L-shape, ensuring good traffic flow.

I've been playing around with some layouts, and my current best idea is attached.

**My questions for you all:**

1. Does this layout make sense ?
2. Any better ideas for arranging the furniture to maximize space or utilize the L-shape/stove/sliding door?
3. Are there any obvious mistakes or improvements I could make?
4. How can I best blend the ""Club Leather"" (more traditional) look with ""Modern Fireside Chairs""? (Thinking rug, lighting, decor, etc.) Can they fit together ?

Really appreciate any fresh perspectives or ideas ! Thanks in advance!

1pbbu91,https://i.redd.it/vev3fhqd9l4g1.jpeg,"Gyros, Neurohelmets and the practical applications of navigation and guidence","So as a preface, I don't read the novels so forgive me if I utter hearsay.

Lad the plural were trapped in a car for 3 hours in poor weather trekking home from a journey to celebrate the Loinsmas of Lad the Younger.  A relaxing post holiday weekend was had by all and he received the royal treatment, the dogs even got to spend time with their girlfriend and all was generally good with the world, unitl...

Lad the Younger, now that he is no longer a child and officially a tween, decided to ask a big boy question, specifically why do mechs  move like humans.  We had recently gone on a binge of watching Dougram on my VR headset, which if you want to try, is very Stålenhag, but it gave me an oppertunity to infect their minds with Dougram, Patlabor, some Gundam, some Robotech, some Macross and so forth.  They both enjoyed Voltron(s) and also felt Pacific Rim makes no sense with it's duplex Dance Dance Revolution setup.  Suffice to say they have a grounding so the question was warranted.

During this process, we are still driving along a relativly unknown (to them) highway in poor weather at speed and I decided to start off with a mech has a gyro and accelerometers and figured it would die there but they were bored and sometimes their dopamine is found not in antagonizing eachother but rather in seeing how far down a rabbit hole they can get me to go... and so we started, sips coffee and pops neck.

AIRS, the advanced intertial reference sphere is a close an analog to what makes your generic shitbox mech not move but move well.

https://youtu.be/AazmxNs5kmE?si=n6TUZ3cuhFxq9OwH Alexander the OK on Peacekeeper AIRS.

The TL:DW is a 3 axis gyro sphere floated in a stable fluid, spinning at mach Jesus and capable of not just high precision but high accuracy.  Never mind that missile knows where it is by knowing where it isn't noise, the mechanical knows where it is because AIRS knows WHERE it is, period.

I showed the lads some highlights and they accepted the general premise that the chassis side computer could maintain stability in a static state but... but what Lads?  Dynamics Father, how can they mech-fu?

The neurohelmet of course.   So we know that the helmet is providing an active one way stream of sensor and targeting data, the scope and scale seem to vary with the source materials but can we all agree that is is a mix of audio/visual overlay and induced haptics?  To borrow an analogy, simstim from Neuromancer. But while the lore says this link is active only in the forward direction, it can also be passive on the return such that the helmet is like a little FMRI and is reading the myoelectric signaling from the pilots brain to initiate and refine movement, using the pilot's vestibular equilibrium as the guidance reference table; infringement the point of focus for vision and attention and the inner ears for stability.

Lads were so far on-board with this, the pilot moves the HOTAS, thinks about walking that way and the chasis side motion control computer does the walking subroutine, using the gyro to not fall and the pilot to refine the fine motor and fluidity.  My heart swelled with joy when Lad the Elder blurted out ""like a PAL!"", that being a Permissive Action Link or the ""always/never"" control for nuclear weapons, ie if the pilot wants to walk forward they have to authorize the mech to move forward and if they don't, it won't.

Now brining it back to AIRS and gyro damage, AIRS has a massive requirement to remain added stable as possible temperature wise and what mech doesn't right?  But if the fluid isn't at the right temperature the sphere will rise or fall which induces false inputs and can lead to contact which when viewed against the 96k rpm means metallic slurry.  So when viewed against gyro hits mobility killing a mech fast, it tracks.

I feel like this seems to explain why mechs move Ina human way and not just like a walking tank.  So what does the group think?",9,1764593142.0,battletech,6,0.91,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Villanova vs. Temple: A Crossover of Clutch and Cash**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Big 5 showdown that’s less “March Madness” and more “December Mayhem.” Villanova, the crosstown kings with the swagger of a team that’s already broken their own three-point record this season, hosts Temple in a matchup that’s equal parts basketball and a metaphor for why you *never* bet on a squirrel to crack a safe. Let’s break it down.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Villanova’s Price Tag is a “Buy”

Villanova (-14) is the financial equivalent of a Tesla on a highway—unstoppable unless it hits a pothole shaped like Temple’s rebounding. The Wildcats are 5-0 in games decided by 10+ points this season, and their 48.1% field-goal shooting matches the defensive ceiling Temple offers. With odds of +107 (FanDuel), Villanova’s implied probability of winning is a staggering **91.4%**. That’s like betting on the sun to rise, but with fewer existential crises.

Temple (+9.0), meanwhile, is the underdog equivalent of a “Get Out of Jail Free” card you accidentally used in 2018. Their 36.4% three-point shooting (3rd in the AAC) is their lone weapon, but even that feels like a group of squirrels on a coffee high—occasional magic, mostly chaos. Their +900 odds imply a **10.5%** chance to win, which is about as likely as me understanding the NBA’s new flagrant foul rules.

---

### Injury Report: Villanova’s Missing Piece (and Why It Doesn’t Matter)

Villanova is missing Duke Brennan, the nation’s leading rebounder (14.4 RPG), due to a sprained ankle. Imagine losing your team’s human garbage can and still outrebounding opponents 33-27. Coach Kevin Willard has pivoted to a “small-ball” lineup, and while he admits it’s “a work in progress,” Tyler Perkins has stepped up like a late-blooming rose—scoring 21 points in his last game after averaging 8.0 previously. Perkins’ transformation? From “mystery player” to “plot twist.”

Temple’s woes? They’re 307th in rebounding,

1pbbi0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pbbi0q/aitha_for_addressing_liesdelusion/,AITHA for addressing Lies/Delusion.,"I'm hoping to find some insights or similar experiences from you all. My husband and I have been together for almost a decade, and we're in our late 20s. We recently encountered a complex situation involving a friend of mine, whom I’ll call M, and my husband’s best friend, J, who’s 30.

In the last few months, I've grown closer to M, a 34-year-old woman who’s been hanging out with our friend group, joining us for brunch, and even attending church with us. M has been candid about her longing for a relationship, but unfortunately, her family life is stressful as she deals with a critical and controlling mother. Despite this, she's incredibly eccentric and full of life. 

Recently, a mutual friend approached me, mentioning that M had been saying J was pursuing her romantically. This took me completely by surprise because J has always indicated he only saw M as a friend, especially since he was casually dating someone else at that time. The mutual friend and her husband were skeptical about M's claims, but she insisted that J was into her, citing moments that didn’t align with the truth. For example, she claimed J planned her birthday party (which was actually group planning) and that they had gone on a solo date (a coffee outing that was after church and 4 people had to leave early leaving the two of them.. Not intentional). I was deeply concerned her feelings were going to get hurt or she would be embarrassed in a public setting. So mural friend and I spoke with M and asked her why she told these lies. Because at worst they worse lies and at best they were deeply twisted versions of the truth that fed her narrative. She basically shutdown said “ I guess I'm just delusional” left without finishing the conversation and blocked me and mutal friend on social media. However people have sent me stuff she has posted such as “betrayed by friends who ruined everything” “I'm passionate out TV shows/ Artisit and friends have called me delusional and it's ruined friendships”. I don't know what to make of this Ive never dealt with someone so out of touch with reality with a complete refusal to have a hard conversation. Should I just let her go off into the sunset?

As you see from the title I have a type, but unfortunately there aren’t many of you - and it doesn’t really happen to meet you irl, hence I’m here; I don’t have high expectations but there’s no harm in trying.
If you see yourself in the description and live in London, I’d be happy if you carry on reading.
About me:
5’ 4, slim/athletic build, longish dark red hair, brown eyes, fair skin, young looking - according to people.
Straight and (ideally) looking for a long term relationship if we’re compatible.
I’m childfree by choice for life - I adore dogs though!
I love keeping fit and being healthy: hiking and kayaking are 2 of my favourite outdoor activities.
I also like cozy time at home reading, watching a film with a plot (especially crime stories) or having a nice meal.
Teetotal, non-smoker and drug free from birth.
Coffee lover.
70s/80s rock/hard rock music is another passion of mine.
I’m into vintage clothes and my fashion style is inspired by the 70s aesthetics.
I have an active job which I love.
I’m a bit of an introvert and value my independence; I’m also quite straightforward and don’t beat around the bush.
Oh and last but not least: I’m a simple, happy person who enjoys the little things in life.
About you:
Fitting the description in the title (if you have beautiful light brown hair, you’re welcome too) and living in London.
Taller than me - it doesn’t take much!
Straight and monogamous, putting effort in building a relationship without giving up at the first disagreement (and I’ll do the same).
Simple and down to earth, someone I can discuss things with and who’s not ashamed of having a personality.
Age wise, I prefer someone in their 30s but I’m not really fussy about it, as long as you’re mature enough, sporty and look after yourself; late 20s and early 40s will do too.
You share some of my values: drug free, non smoker and child free are not negotiable, sorry; if you’re teetotal even better, but I don’t mind if you drink moderately.
Bonus points if you share my passion for travelling!
If most of the above resonates with you, why
not give it a go?!?
I look forward to hearing from you. x

Unfortunately money is tight right now and since Friday I haven’t been able to afford food (please don’t tell me to go to the food bank, I’ve been there and all they have is rotted and moist fruits and vegetables and I tried to eat them and they were inedible). 

So I have been trying to go without eating until my next paycheck, my plan was to try and suppress my appetite by drinking coffee every day until I can afford things (I’m drinking around 10-12 cups per day)

Friday through yesterday were fine but all of a sudden I started sweating, got dizzy, got hand tremors, and felt faint. 

I dumpster dived a rotisserie chicken but still haven’t been feeling well and I think my dizziness might be from dehydration.

Should I go to the ER to get some IV fluids? I also tried eating a banana but I didn’t feel it did much. 

I’ve found some public water fountains but no matter how much I drink I still feel dizzy and weak

I tend to go through 2-4 rolls per week, on my own. I've had a few moments recently where it's become clear to me that this is unusual. A friend recently received one thin, sad roll for a 3 week hotel stay... and was so unbothered by this she turned down a second one, like ""oh, I'm okay? There's one in my room already right?""  

That could be explained by her expecting to receive more each week, but I googled it and some people on the internet say they do use one roll in 2-3 weeks. 

I've been here 24h and I finished 1 roll. (I have been on the heavy part of my period though, and it was a small thin roll)

I must be doing something seriously different to other people...!? Can anyone tell me what am I doing different?   

Here's all the things I can think of that might impact how much I use: 

- I live alone. I don't host guests often.
- I WFH, am single and am quite a homebody so I'm at home a lot. Like pretty much all day and night. 
- I menstruate 5-6 days every month
- I use double-length rolls, of decent 3 ply quality - not super plush or anything, but not cheap ones. 
- I guess I do drink a lot of water so usually pee probably 5-7 times a day (?) I take medications that dehydrate so I drink at least 2L a day. 
- I drink 1 coffee a day, no tea, no soda, no energy drinks or anything weird 
- I think I am a fairly good pooper (can't believe I'm fucking writing this on reddit) I usually go 1-2 times per day, and probably 8 out of 10 of them are good quality poops, the kind that don't leave anything behind
- I have a bum gun already, but only use it for poop and during my period. But I find I use more paper when I use it because I need to dry off? 
- I fold / roll, don't scrunch 
- I am 36yo and not particularly saggy or wrinkly down there, I think?! Maybe I am though? 
- I am kinda fat, maybe it's that? 

I think I usually do wipe multiple times because I like to be really clean and make sure I am. Is nobody else doing that? 

Depending on the thickness of the paper, i use probably 5 squares if it's good paper and 8-10 if it's bad paper. But if I use less then my fingers go through the paper, or it gets wet through to where my fingers are. Is this something that doesn't really bother other people? I'm not like super fussy about bodily functions, I use a menstrual cup, I'm not afraid of pee on my hands I guess, I just don't really feel clean if the paper got so wet it's tearing through, and that will then cause me to get more paper and wipe again, so just grabbing less paper doesn't seem to solve the problem.  

If there is poop on the paper I will discard it and get a whole new piece. Is that abnormal?

Or is this one of those things where there is some weird shame or social rules around it, and people are possibly just pretending to use less TP than they really do or something? 

I know I'm being really autistic about this (not figuratively, I literally am autistic). I would just like to have some framework for what is happening here. 

I want to believe maybe i just have high standards for cleanliness, but maybe I just have a big flappy ass wrinkly vj and I drink way too much water?? Help

I have recently realised I'm into women. & have started to date /see women. So this is all pretty new to me. Anyway, so I have a dinner date tomorrow night with a woman that I have met once before. That was just a low key casual coffee. This time it's dinner. I want to give her a small gift. But I don't want to come across as being weird, inappropriate, too much, immature, cliche etc... 
Lesbian ladies, would it be OK to give her something? Like perhaps a single rose & small chocolate? Do you think she would appreciate it or would it make her feel uncomfortable? As I'm just getting to know her, I don't really know what she likes so can't really get her something too personal either. 
I'm genuinely & generally a giving person so do naturally Iike tp gift others that I care about with something. Any advice would be greatly appreciated 🙏🏼 xo",2,1764591564.0,LesbianActually,11,0.75,False

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.
