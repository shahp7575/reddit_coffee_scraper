To be fair, it was a 10-year-old ripe Pu’er, super earthy and mellow. I guess if you’re not used to fermented flavors, it really throws you off.

But here’s the thing — I *love* that deep, grounding flavor. It’s like drinking time itself.

1lk1t9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CareerAdvicePH/comments/1lk1t9c/can_i_still_shift_careers_from_enterprise_sales/,Can I still shift careers from Enterprise Sales to Business Analyst at 30?,"Hi Redditors, I’m at a bit of a crossroads in my career.

I spent the last 5 years in enterprise sales and client management at a SaaS tech company. Most recently, I completed a pre-MBA at the Asian Institute of Management, which helped me reflect on my long-term goals. Through this, I realized that sales isn’t the path I want to pursue. What really excites me is analyzing business processes, solving operational issues, and turning insights into action—work that aligns closely with what Business Analysts do.

Honestly, I had never heard of the “Business Analyst” role until recently. But after reading up, I finally found a name for the type of work I’m passionate about. I’m 30 and shifting careers feels scary, but I’m up for the challenge! 💪🏻

I do see transferable skills from my previous roles—things like:
- Gathering and translating business requirements
- Writing proposals, user stories, and case studies
- Process mapping (basic but learning!)
Facilitating client onboarding and UATs
- Collaborating cross-functionally with tech, marketing, and customer success teams
- Tools I used: JIRA, Confluence, Zendesk, Freshsales, Monday.com

I’m planning on building up my technical skills. I know I’ll need to learn Excel (advanced), SQL, Tableau or Power BI, maybe even basic Python. I’m excited to dive in—I just feel overwhelmed on where to begin and how to structure my learning.

My current challenge: recruiters still view me primarily as a salesperson. It’s disheartening to be overlooked for analyst or operations roles, even when I highlight my analytical experience. But I know there’s someone out there willing to take a chance on a career shifter with the right mindset and grit—like me!

So I’m here to ask:
- For those of you working as Business Analysts, especially in tech or consulting: what was your path like?
- What skills and tools do you use the most in your day-to-day?
- Are there companies more open to hiring career shifters? IBM? McKinsey? BCG? Or other local companies?
- What’s the typical salary range for entry-level BAs in the Philippines?
- Any online courses or learning paths you recommend?

Also, if anyone’s up for a coffee chat around Makati or BGC—I’d love to connect and learn from your journey (coffee’s on me!).

Thank you in advance! Your insights would mean a lot 🙏",1,1750846319.0,CareerAdvicePH,0,1.0,False
1lk1smf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ratnaprabhadentalcli/comments/1lk1smf/how_to_choose_between_teeth_whitening_and_dental/,How to Choose Between Teeth Whitening and Dental Implants,"A shining, healthy smile is generally the key to confidence and self-esteem. In the modern era of superior dental care, two of the most popular treatments are teeth whitening and dental implants. Both have different functions—one improves looks and the other functions. But if you have to decide between them, what should you consider?

Whether you are searching for teeth whitening cost in Mumbai or comparing the lifespan of dental implants in Mumbai, this article assists you in making an informed choice depending on your dental status, affordability, and cosmetic needs.







# Understanding the Basics

# What Is Teeth Whitening?

Teeth whitening is a painless cosmetic dentistry treatment intended to eliminate stains and discoloration from the teeth. Teeth whitening can greatly enhance the brightness of your smile and is usually done in one or two visits to your cosmetic dentist in Navi Mumbai. There are several kinds of whitening treatments, namely in-office bleaching, take-home trays, and laser whitening, each appropriate for different degrees of discoloration and sensitivity.

# [What Are Dental Implants?](https://ratnaprabhadentalclinic.com/service/dental-implants/)

Dental implants are artificial tooth roots made of titanium that are surgically placed into the jawbone. They provide a durable foundation for permanent or removable replacement teeth and are ideal for individuals who have lost teeth due to injury, decay, or disease. Over time, they fuse with the jawbone in a process called osseointegration, making them incredibly stable and reliable.

# [When to Choose Teeth Whitening](https://ratnaprabhadentalclinic.com/service/teeth-cleaning-polishing/)

# You Have Healthy Teeth and Gums

If your teeth are healthy but have become discolored because of age, ingestion of staining materials (such as coffee or tobacco), or natural attrition, tooth whitening would be an appropriate choice. It adds to aesthetics without structural alteration to your teeth.

# You Want Immediate Aesthetic Improvement

Professional whitening procedures like the best teeth whitening in Navi Mumbai treatments can reveal outcomes within a single visit. Perfect for weddings, job interviews, or other special events when a beaming smile is important.

# Budget-Friendly Option

The teeth whitening cost in Mumbai is considerably lower than that of implants, so it is affordable to most patients looking for cosmetic enhancements. Some clinics even have special offers and deals during festival times or dental health months.

# When to Choose Dental Implants

# You Have Missing or Severely Damaged Teeth

Dental implants are the gold standard for tooth replacement. If a tooth is beyond repair due to trauma or decay, an implant not only restores functionality but also maintains the alignment of adjacent teeth.

# You’re Looking for Long-Term Solutions

Whereas whitening can become a routine necessity, dental implants in Mumbai will last a lifetime if cared for properly. They are immune to decay and give the stability that removable dentures rarely can.

# Improved Oral Health

Implants stop bone loss by stimulating the jawbone, similar to natural teeth. They also prevent neighboring teeth from shifting, keeping the overall shape and well-being of your mouth intact. This makes them not only cosmetic, but also restorative and preventative.

# Contrasting Teeth Whitening and Dental Implants

# Purpose

* [**Teeth Whitening**](https://ratnaprabhadentalclinic.com/service/teeth-cleaning-polishing/)**:** Essentially cosmetic, with the goal of improving the look of your smile.
* **Dental Implants:** Cosmetic and restorative, to fill in missing teeth and maintain overall oral wellness.

# Procedure Time

* **Teeth Whitening:** Short and minimal; most appointments range from 30 minutes to 1 hour.
* **Dental Implants:** Consists of several steps, from consulting to surgery, healing, and crowning. Takes a few months.

# Affordability Factor

* **Teeth Whitening Cost in Mumbai:** Approximately INR 5,000–20,000 based on the procedure and clinic.
* [**Dental Implants in Mumbai**](https://ratnaprabhadentalclinic.com/service/dental-implants/)**:** Varies between INR 25,000–60,000 per implant, depending on materials and complexity.

# Longevity

* **Teeth Whitening:** Results last for 6 months to 2 years; lifestyle habits dictate longevity.
* **Dental Implants:** Can have a lifespan of 20 years and above; usually regarded as a lifetime solution.

# Maintenance

* **Teeth Whitening:** Periodic touch-ups and staying away from stain-inducing foods or beverages are needed.
* **Dental Implants:** Need regular dental hygiene such as brushing, flossing, and check-ups.

# Root Canal vs Implant: Another Common Dilemma

[Root canal ](https://ratnaprabhadentalclinic.com/service/root-canal-treatment/)vs implant is another decision patients must usually decide. If the tooth can be saved, a root canal is generally the choice. It is a process of cleaning and sealing infected pulp in a tooth, and you can keep your natural tooth. But if the tooth is so damaged or infected that it cannot be saved, extraction with a dental implant is the following best option. A cosmetic dentist in Navi Mumbai with expertise can evaluate the condition of the tooth and suggest the best course of treatment.

# Role of a Cosmetic Dentist in Navi Mumbai

A skilled cosmetic dentist in Navi Mumbai is an important part of your smile makeover process. Not only can they advise you on the best procedure according to your personal needs, but also rely on cutting-edge diagnostic instruments to help you achieve long-term success. Facilities such as Ratna Prabha Dental Clinic provide 3D imaging, intraoral scanners, and personalized treatment plans developed to suit your smile aspirations. 

# Pros and Cons Summary

# [Teeth Whitening](https://ratnaprabhadentalclinic.com/service/teeth-cleaning-polishing/)

**Pros:**

* No invasive procedure involved
* The procedure is super quick
* Immediate visible results
* Affordable and accessible

**Cons:**

* Temporary results
* Not suitable for all types of discoloration
* Ineffective on crowns or veneers

# [Dental Implants](https://ratnaprabhadentalclinic.com/service/dental-implants/)

**Pros:**

* Permanent and stable solution
* Looks and functions like natural teeth
* Preserves jawbone and oral health

**Cons:**

* Requires surgery
* Higher upfront cost
* Takes longer to complete treatment

# Things to Discuss with Your Dentist

Before making a decision, it's essential to have an open discussion with your cosmetic dentist in Navi Mumbai. 

**Topics may include:**

* Any signs of gum disease or bone loss
* Your commitment and aptitude to receive a surgical treatment
* The underlying reason behind your tooth color change
* Your current oral hygiene habits and how they impact results

# Combining Both Treatments

In most instances, both procedures can be done in combination to achieve the best possible outcome. You might require a dental implant to replace a lost tooth but also wish to have a whiter smile overall. Following the implant process, you can go ahead with whitening the rest of the natural teeth. A well-thought-out plan by a cosmetic dentist in Navi Mumbai allows all your cosmetic and restoration needs to be fulfilled in harmony.

# Financing and Insurance

Though dental implants in Mumbai cost more, they are sometimes partially covered by dental insurance if considered medically necessary. Teeth whitening is more likely to be elective and not covered. Nevertheless, clinics do provide financing options like EMIs and package discounts, which do reduce the cost of treatments.

# Aftercare Tips

# [Teeth Whitening](https://ratnaprabhadentalclinic.com/service/teeth-cleaning-polishing/):

* Do not consume coffee, tea, and red wine for at least 48 hours after the procedure
* Use whitening toothpaste and mouthwash to keep brightness
* Regular dental cleanings and occasional touch-ups advised

# [Dental Implants](https://ratnaprabhadentalclinic.com/service/dental-implants/):

* Keep super good oral hygiene to avoid infection
* Do not smoke to allow good healing and durability
* Regular dental appointments for implant check-ups and upkeep

# Final Thoughts

Teeth whitening vs dental implants is not a one-size-fits-all situation. It will be based on your dental requirements, aspirations, and affordability. Consulting a reliable cosmetic dentist in Navi Mumbai guarantees you the expert opinion as per your specific context. Both procedures have advantages and disadvantages, and in certain situations, their combination is the best option.

Even with these activities, I sometimes find myself wishing for gentle connection:
Someone to share a walk, concert, or coffee with.

The grind seems to be around 19g which is fine, but the output around 46g. So it's a bit too much. The barista says grind should be 13, I've set it at 10. If the grind is more coarser, doesn't it mean the output it will be even more? So I maybe need to set grind to 8 or 9?

1lk1ks9,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1lk1ks9/timmys_new_roommates_part_14/,Timmy's New Roommates part 14,"The holidays had come and gone in a blur of opulence and quiet servitude. Thanksgiving had been a grand affair, with Brandy's parents staying overnight, their presence elevating the household’s sense of decorum and hierarchy. Carol and Timmy, once tucked away in the guest room, had been quietly moved to the musty box room in the basement to make space. They never returned upstairs. No one told them not to. No one needed to.

After that, the basement became theirs—by default more than by design. There were no discussions about moving back, no acknowledgment of the change. They simply remained there, sleeping on narrow cots surrounded by mold-slick walls, the scent of damp earth and faint mildew now a constant companion. It was the kind of quiet exile that didn’t require permission or explanation. Brandy had said nothing more on the matter, and that silence spoke louder than any command.

By Christmas, the house was adorned in lavish decorations, each detail meticulously overseen by Brandy and executed by her loyal staff—Timmy and Carol. Wreaths were hung, silver was polished, and floors were scrubbed to a shine. Brandy never lifted a finger, of course. Her time was far too valuable. Instead, she floated through the season like royalty, offering commands with a soft clap or a pointed look—always impeccably dressed, always the center of her own world.

The company holiday party had been the high point of the season, at least for Brandy. Held in an upscale ballroom downtown, Trent—now firmly entrenched as one of the youngest and most celebrated partners at the firm—had proposed in front of the entire room. Brandy had squealed with delight as the diamond caught the light, a perfect, gleaming symbol of her status. She had accepted with a graceful tear and a kiss, the room erupting in applause.

When they returned home that evening, Brandy radiant in a floor-length champagne gown and Trent buzzed with triumph, Carol had prepared a late supper while Timmy opened the door for them. They had both waited until after Brandy changed into her silk robe to offer their congratulations.

“Congratulations, Miss Brandy… Mr. Trent,” Timmy had said softly, his head bowed, while Carol added, “We’re both very happy for you.”

Brandy smiled, pleased with her servants’ obedient congratulations. Trent spoke up. “Brandy’s gonna have a lot on her plate over the next year, so we’re gonna need you two to be working extra hard for her. Engagement parties, wedding plans, and a lot more client dinners we’ll be hosting. I expect you two to do all the regular chores and be her worker bees.”

Timmy and Carol nodded meekly. “Yes, sir.”

The moment passed, and life resumed as it always did—demanding, precise, and centered entirely around Brandy’s needs. The basement room remained unchanged, dim and cold, with a single lamp and the faint hum of the heating pipes above. It was no longer a temporary space. It was their quarters now—permanent and unspoken.

They never asked if they might return upstairs. It wasn’t fear that stopped them, not exactly. It was something deeper—something shaped by months of subtle correction, of expectation and obedience. Asking would have implied they had a say in their own placement. And they didn’t.

As the new year dawned, Brandy and Trent basked in engagement bliss, planning their wedding and making arrangements for a summer trip to the South of France. Carol and Timmy served with downcast eyes—no longer guests, just the help.

And even that felt generous.

It was a warm spring afternoon when I pulled into the driveway, arms full of errands—new dresses of Brandy’s that I'd just picked up from the tailor, their delicate fabrics rustling with each step. Immediately, my eyes fell on the sleek black sedan parked next to Trent’s car. That was unusual; Trent never came home at this hour during the week.

Stepping into the house, the cool air conditioning greeted me but did nothing to quell the growing unease in my chest. Voices drifted in from the living room—Brandy’s, unmistakably poised, and another, older and more formal voice I recognized almost immediately: Mr. Wentworth, the firm’s lead estate attorney.

Turning the corner, I saw them. Trent sat comfortably on the couch in a crisp charcoal suit, Brandy beside him, stunning in a sophisticated, figure-hugging business outfit that looked effortlessly chic and expensive. Her bare legs were crossed gracefully, glossy hair framing her face as if sculpted in place. Mr. Wentworth stood beside them, flipping through a stack of documents, while my mother stood quietly nearby, hands folded over her apron, head slightly bowed.

“Oh, good, there he is,” Trent said, looking up as I entered. “Perfect timing, Timmy. You remember Mr. Wentworth, our estate attorney?”

“Yes, sir,” I mumbled, awkwardly shifting the dresses in my arms. “Hello.”

Mr. Wentworth didn’t respond. He didn’t even glance in my direction.

Brandy turned her head gracefully. “Timmy, run my things up to the room and then come straight back down. We have some things to go over. Be quick.”

“Yes, Miss Brandy.”

I hurried upstairs, my heart pounding and mind racing, then returned promptly, standing beside my mother. She didn’t look at me, and I avoided her gaze too. I already sensed something was terribly wrong. It was the atmosphere—the way Trent and Brandy confidently occupied the space, leaving no doubt about who controlled the room.

“So,” Trent began casually, “big news—we bought a house. Much bigger, much nicer. It’s just outside the city.”

Brandy smiled broadly beside him, her expression smug yet charming. “And of course,” she added lightly, “you two will be coming with us. You're going to love it. We even have a cute little servants’ quarters for you. There’s enough space for two small beds. I think you’ll find it more comfortable than the basement cubby we have you in now.”

She said this so naturally, as if it were perfectly obvious. There was no discussion, no room for questions. My mother and I were simply part of their inventory—like furniture waiting to be moved.

“With everything going on,” Trent continued smoothly, “we’ve had Mr. Wentworth set things up so I now have power of attorney over your condo and remaining assets. You two will be busy packing and transitioning, so I’ll take care of selling everything.”

A sudden surge of panic tightened in my chest. “Uh… sir, I—” I began, the mild protest slipping out before I could stop myself.

Trent shot me an immediate, sharp stare, his eyes narrowing with clear irritation. My words died instantly, my cheeks flushing with shame. I quickly lowered my eyes, knowing I’d made a grave mistake by daring to interrupt Trent—especially in front of Mr. Wentworth and Miss Brandy. The silence hung thick and oppressive.

Brandy smoothly stepped in, her tone soft yet firm. “Timmy, don’t trouble yourself with all of this. It’s already been handled.”

Trent gestured toward the coffee table, where the stack of legal documents waited ominously. “We’ve officially added you and Carol to our estate, so you’ll always be accounted for. Mr. Wentworth made sure everything is official. It’s all been filed already—no messy paperwork for you two to worry about.”

I glanced briefly toward my mother. She remained motionless, eyes fixed downward, not daring to speak. Ever since the harsh slap she’d received at Thanksgiving—and a second punishment from Trent following an accidental spill on his suit—she had become utterly obedient. Brandy had sternly reinforced new household rules that day: whenever she or Trent walked past, we were to immediately move to the wall and lower our heads. Between these punishments, my mother had grown extraordinarily compliant, too frightened to risk disobedience again.

Brandy turned gently to Mr. Wentworth, asking softly, “So they don’t need to sign anything, correct?”

“No,” Mr. Wentworth confirmed casually. “With our connections at the courthouse, everything’s already finalized. I presented the court with evidence that Timothy and Carol rely entirely on you both for food, shelter, and clothing, and since they’ve provided unpaid labor for an extended period, the court recognizes their status under implied ownership.”

I saw the documents clearly now, my eyes scanning the text with growing dread. It wasn’t just about the condo—the language chillingly spelled out what my mother and I had become:

“Part of the estate of Trent Michaels and Brandy Weston.”  
“Permanent subordinates of the household.”  
“Caretakers under implied ownership.”

Trent gestured toward us. “So, what do you need from these two?”

Mr. Wentworth took out a digital tablet. “Just a fingerprint for the ledger and their initials, so we can officially identify them.”

I nervously tried once more. “Uh… er, may I ask a ques—”

Brandy interrupted me effortlessly, standing up to straighten my collar possessively. “Timmy, no questions right now. Just leave everything to Mr. Trent and me. Now do as you're asked. Carol, you first.”

Mr. Wentworth approached my mother, gently taking her thumb and pressing it onto the tablet, then directing her to initial beside her digital print. Brandy moved close to my mother, fussing gently with her uniform.

“Good girl, Carol,” she cooed condescendingly, lightly scratching behind my mother’s ear as though rewarding a compliant pet.

I underwent the same humiliating process, placing my thumb on the tablet and initialing beside my biometric print. The screen read clearly: “Asset Ledger,” along with an item number beside my name. It was official. We were nothing more than inventory, formally recorded as property.

Trent turned back to Mr. Wentworth. “Regarding the sale of the condo and any remaining assets, like Timmy’s car—how will that proceed?”

Mr. Wentworth responded calmly, as if it were all perfectly normal. “Since Timothy and Carol are now formally assets of your estate, everything they previously owned transfers directly into your holdings.”

He spoke so casually, effortlessly stripping away my ownership of everything I’d ever earned, handing it neatly over to Trent and Brandy—our new, official owners.

“Well, that went as smoothly as we could’ve hoped,” Mr. Wentworth remarked cheerfully.

Brandy remained near me, straightening my collar again in a gesture of open possession. “Oh yes, I knew these two would be easy. They’re both so docile, requiring very little obedience training.”

We stood humiliated, silent, and defeated as she discussed us openly—like pets she’d fully domesticated.

Brandy finally dismissed us with a wave. “Okay, you two—back to your chores. We have more house details to discuss with Mr. Wentworth.”



Obediently, we left the room without protest or argument, quietly accepting our servitude. Neither my mother nor I resisted. We both knew our place now—officially property, legally recognized as belonging entirely to the beautiful young couple we served.

**Subsection A: Definition of Domestic Subordinates**  
For the purposes of this agreement, *Domestic Subordinates* refers to the individuals Timothy Howard (hereinafter “Timothy”) and Carol Howard (hereinafter “Carol”), who shall be classified as non-financial, dependent assets within the estate holdings of Trent Michaels and Brandy Weston (hereinafter collectively referred to as “the Proprietors”). Timothy and Carol shall fulfill the roles of live-in caretakers, domestic staff, and ancillary support personnel within the Proprietors’ primary and secondary residences.

**Subsection B: Ownership and Transferability**  
Timothy and Carol are incorporated into the estate under joint ownership of the Proprietors. In the event of the death or incapacitation of one Proprietor, full and immediate ownership of all holdings—including the Domestic Subordinates—shall transfer to the surviving Proprietor. This clause ensures continuity of household operations and uninterrupted domestic support.

**Subsection C: Valuation of Domestic Subordinates**  
For internal documentation and insurance purposes, Timothy is assigned a nominal valuation of $12,000, reflecting his transferable administrative experience, physical capability, and long-term domestic utility. Carol is assigned a nominal valuation of $8,000, reflecting her reduced mobility due to age, but recognized diligence and reliability. These valuations are non-liquid and serve solely for estate accounting and recordkeeping.

**Subsection D: Obligations of Domestic Subordinates**  
Timothy and Carol shall:

1. Perform all domestic and personal support duties as directed by the Proprietors, including but not limited to cleaning, organizing, meal preparation, personal grooming assistance, and errands.
2. Maintain the household standards as determined by the Proprietors. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary measures outlined in Subsection E.

Timothy and Carol shall not:

* Contest their inclusion in the estate structure.
* Seek or solicit external employment, lodging, or legal recourse without explicit, written approval from both Proprietors.
* Act or speak on behalf of the household unless specifically instructed.

**Subsection E: Disciplinary Measures**  
The Proprietors reserve the right to impose corrective measures for underperformance or deviation from assigned conduct. These may include—but are not limited to—task reassignment, loss of privileges, increased labor hours, or temporary confinement. Enforcement of such measures rests solely with the Proprietors and shall not be subject to review or appeal.

**Subsection F: Sustenance and Upkeep**  
The Proprietors shall provide for the basic needs of the Domestic Subordinates, including food, modest shelter, and appropriate clothing. Any additional comforts or privileges (such as leisure time, personal effects, or correspondence) shall be conferred solely at the Proprietors’ discretion and are not considered entitlements.

**Subsection G: Permanency of Status**  
The designation of Timothy and Carol as Domestic Subordinates is fixed, continuous, and non-revocable. This status shall remain binding regardless of changes in residence or estate ownership. In the event the estate is sold or otherwise transferred, Timothy and Carol shall be conveyed along with the property unless otherwise directed by the Proprietors.



**Subsection H: Legal Binding and Consent**  
The enforceability of this section does not require the consent, acknowledgment, or participation of Timothy or Carol. Their status as Domestic Subordinates is established by the Proprietors and recognized by the estate’s legal and administrative authorities. No signature, agreement, or affirmation from the Domestic Subordinates shall be required for enforcement or documentation purposes.",2,1750845467.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

1lk1hmq,https://youtu.be/m93xmBQaRy0,3 Very Scary TRUE Cafe Late Night Horror Stories,"# ""Memorable"":

I stepped into the Olivier Cafe just past 10 PM, my usual refuge for late-night work. The small cafe in Jakarta’s bustling Grand Indonesia mall felt like a quiet island in the city’s chaos. Dim yellow lights cast a warm glow over the polished wooden tables and worn leather chairs. The rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint sweetness of pastries from the counter, where a barista lazily wiped down the espresso machine. Soft jazz hummed through the speakers, low and soothing, but tonight, the air felt heavy, like the calm before something breaks. I carried my laptop to my favorite corner table, near a window overlooking the empty mall corridor, and settled in, hoping to lose myself in emails.The cafe was nearly deserted, just how I liked it. A tired-looking man in a suit sipped espresso at the counter, flipping through a newspaper. Two women sat at a table near the back, their voices cutting through the quiet. One, dressed in a crisp white blouse and tailored pants, typed furiously on her laptop, her hair pulled into a tight bun. Her name, I’d learn later, was Mirna. The other, in a loose t-shirt and jeans, scrolled through her phone with restless fingers. That was Jessica. Their conversation wasn’t loud, but it carried a tension that made me pause. “Jessica, you need to let it go,” Mirna said, her voice steady but tinged with frustration. “Patrick’s married now. He’s moved on, and you should too.” Jessica’s head snapped up, her eyes narrowing. “You don’t understand, Mirna. He was my everything. You’re just saying this because you’ve got your perfect life now, don’t you?” Her words dripped with bitterness, sharp enough to make me shift uncomfortably in my seat. I opened my laptop, trying to focus, but their voices pulled me in like a magnet.I glanced at them, catching Jessica’s eye for a split second. Her stare was intense, almost predatory, and it sent a shiver down my spine. Then she smiled—a small, tight-lipped smile that didn’t reach her eyes. It was the kind of smile that made you question what someone was thinking. I looked away, pretending to type, my fingers hovering over the keys. The barista brought their drinks: a tall glass of Vietnamese iced coffee for Mirna, its creamy layers swirling under the light, and a soda for Jessica, fizzing softly. I noticed Jessica watching as Mirna stirred her coffee with a metal spoon, the ice clinking against the glass. There was something in Jessica’s expression—satisfaction, maybe, or anticipation—that made my stomach twist. She leaned forward slightly, her eyes fixed on Mirna’s every move, like a cat watching its prey.Trying to shake the unease, I forced my attention back to my screen. The cafe’s warmth, usually comforting, felt stifling now. The jazz seemed to fade, replaced by the low hum of my own heartbeat. I typed a few words, deleted them, and glanced at the women again. Mirna sipped her coffee, her face softening for a moment as she savored it. Jessica sat back, her fingers tapping her phone, but her eyes never left Mirna. “You always loved that coffee,” Jessica said, her voice oddly flat. Mirna nodded, distracted. “It’s my favorite. Reminds me of home.” The conversation shifted to small talk, but the tension lingered, like a thread pulled too tight.About ten minutes later, Mirna’s voice broke the quiet. “Jessica, I don’t feel right,” she said, her hand pressing against her stomach. Her face paled, and she winced, setting her glass down with a shaky clink. “It’s probably nothing,” Jessica replied, her tone too calm, almost rehearsed. “Maybe you drank it too fast. Let me help you to the bathroom.” She stood, offering her arm, and Mirna, now visibly unsteady, leaned on her. They disappeared behind the bathroom door, and I tried to focus again, but my hands wouldn’t stop trembling. Something was wrong—deeply wrong.A loud thud echoed from the bathroom, followed by a sharp scream that cut through the cafe. The man at the counter dropped his newspaper, and the barista froze mid-wipe. My heart pounded as I jumped up, my chair scraping against the floor. I ran to the bathroom, pushing the door open. Mirna was sprawled on the tiled floor, her body convulsing, her arms twitching unnaturally. Foam bubbled at her mouth, and her eyes were wide, glassy with panic. Jessica stood over her, her face pale but oddly composed, like she was watching a scene she’d already rehearsed. “What happened?” I shouted, kneeling beside Mirna. Her skin was clammy, and her breathing was ragged, like she was choking on air. “I don’t know!” Jessica said, her voice rising, but her eyes didn’t match her words—they were too steady, too cold. “Call an ambulance!” I yelled to the barista, who was already fumbling with his phone. The man in the suit ran over, loosening Mirna’s blouse, trying to help, but her convulsions grew weaker. Her eyes locked onto mine for a moment, pleading, before they rolled back. The bathroom’s fluorescent light flickered, casting shadows that made the scene feel like a nightmare. The barista shouted into his phone, giving the cafe’s address, his voice shaking. Jessica stepped back, her hands clasped tightly, watching as if detached. “She just collapsed,” she murmured, almost to herself. But I couldn’t shake the image of her earlier smile, the way she’d watched Mirna drink.The ambulance arrived in what felt like forever but was probably only minutes. Paramedics rushed in, their boots squeaking on the floor, and pushed us aside. They worked on Mirna, checking her pulse, shouting instructions, but her body was still now, too still. They loaded her onto a stretcher, her glass of coffee still sitting on the table, half-empty, the ice melted into a murky pool. Jessica followed them out, her face a mask of shock, but I noticed her hands—steady, not shaking like mine. Later, at the hospital, the news came: Mirna was dead. Poisoned, they said, with cyanide in her coffee. The police took Jessica in for questioning, and the story unraveled. She’d been driven by jealousy, obsessed with a man they both knew, Patrick, who’d chosen someone else. Mirna had urged her to move on, and that advice, meant to help, had sparked a quiet, deadly rage. Jessica had slipped the cyanide into the coffee, unnoticed in the cafe’s late-night calm, and watched her friend die.I couldn’t go back to the Olivier Cafe after that. The memory of that night clung to me like damp air. I kept seeing Jessica’s smile, the way her eyes followed Mirna’s every sip, knowing what was coming. I’d lie awake at night, replaying the thud, the scream, the foam at Mirna’s mouth. The horror wasn’t in some monster or ghost—it was in the betrayal, the calculation, the way evil could hide in a familiar face, in a place I’d once called safe. I’d sit in my apartment, staring at my laptop, unable to work, haunted by the thought that I’d witnessed a murder unfold, one quiet sip at a time.

  


# ""The Last Cup"":

I’ve been working the late shift at the cafe for three years, and I know every creak of the old wooden floor, every hum of the coffee machine, every flicker of the neon “Open” sign that buzzes outside. The cafe is small, tucked on a quiet street corner, with five wobbly tables, a scratched-up counter, and a back room crammed with supplies. The front windows are big, showing the empty street outside, where streetlights cast pale circles on the pavement. It’s 10:30 PM, and I’m counting down to closing at 11. I’m alone tonight, wiping down counters with a damp rag that smells faintly of bleach, the air heavy with the scent of coffee grounds and burnt toast.The bell above the door jingles, sharp and sudden. I look up, and it’s him—the man who’s been coming in every night this week. He’s tall, too thin, his gray hoodie pulled up so the shadows hide most of his face. A jagged scar runs down his left cheek, puckered and white, catching the dim light. His hands are bony, knuckles sharp under pale skin, and he always smells faintly of cigarette smoke. I force a smile, my stomach tightening. “Hi, welcome back. Black coffee, no sugar?”He nods, barely looking at me. “Yeah.” His voice is low, rough, like he’s gargling gravel. I turn to the coffee machine, my hands moving on autopilot as I pour the steaming liquid into a chipped white mug. The machine hisses, and I slide the cup across the counter. He hands me crumpled dollar bills, his fingers brushing mine for a split second—cold, like he’s been standing in a freezer. He takes the coffee and shuffles to the corner table, the one farthest from the door, where the light barely reaches. He sits, hunched, staring into the cup like it holds secrets.I go back to cleaning, scrubbing the counter harder than I need to. The clock ticks louder, or maybe it’s just my nerves. It’s 10:45 now, and I want him gone. Most customers leave by now, but he’s still here, sipping so slowly the coffee must be cold. I feel his eyes on me, heavy, like a weight pressing into my back. I glance over, and he’s staring—not at the cup anymore, but at me. His eyes are deep-set, dark, unblinking. My heart skips, and I look away, pretending to rearrange the sugar packets.At 10:55, I can’t stall anymore. I walk to his table, clutching the rag like it’s a lifeline. “Sorry, sir, we’re closing in five minutes. Need anything else before I start locking up?” My voice is steady, but my pulse hammers in my ears.He tilts his head, the hood shifting to show more of his scar. “What if I don’t want to leave?” His words are slow, deliberate, and a chill crawls up my spine. I laugh, trying to keep it light, but it comes out shaky. “Well, I gotta close up. Boss’s rules, you know?”He doesn’t smile. Just leans back, his fingers tracing the rim of the mug. “Rules,” he says, like he’s mocking the word. “You always follow rules?” His voice has an edge now, sharp enough to make me step back. I force a nod, muttering something about finishing up, and head to the register. My hands tremble as I count the cash, the coins clinking too loudly in the quiet.A loud crash echoes from the back room, like something heavy hitting the floor. I freeze, the rag slipping from my hand. It sounded like boxes falling, maybe the stack of coffee bean bags I restocked yesterday. I glance at the man, but he’s still at his table, staring at his coffee, unmoving. My mouth goes dry. “Stay here,” I say, more to myself than to him, and grab the broom leaning against the counter. It’s flimsy, the handle worn smooth, but it’s all I’ve got.The back room is through a narrow doorway, past the counter. The single bulb inside flickers, casting jagged shadows on the walls lined with shelves. I step in, broom raised, my breath shallow. The air smells of dust and stale coffee. There, on the floor, a stack of bags has toppled, spilling beans across the tiles. I nudge them with the broom, my heart pounding. Did they fall on their own? The shelves look steady, nothing else out of place. I scan the corners, half-expecting someone to step out from behind the boxes. Nothing. Just silence, broken by the bulb’s faint buzz.I head back to the front, my legs shaky. The man’s gone. His mug sits empty on the table, steam still curling faintly from the rim. The chair is pushed in, neat, like he planned his exit. The bell didn’t ring. I didn’t hear the door. My stomach lurches. I rush to the front door—still locked, the “Closed” sign facing out. My breath catches. How did he leave? The windows are sealed shut, the kind that don’t even open. I spin around, scanning the cafe. The tables are empty, the shadows still.Then I hear it—a soft, deliberate scrape, like metal dragging on wood, coming from the back room. My blood runs cold. I grip the broom tighter, my knuckles aching. “Hello?” I call, my voice barely a whisper. No answer. Just that scrape, slow, rhythmic, like someone’s testing me. I should run. I should unlock the door, sprint to the street, and call for help. But my bag, my keys, my phone—they’re all in the back room, on a shelf by the door. I can’t leave without them.I creep toward the doorway, the broom shaking in my hands. The cafe feels smaller, the walls closer, the lights dimmer. My sneakers squeak on the floor, too loud in the quiet. The scrape stops, and the silence is worse. I reach the doorway and peer inside. The bulb flickers again, throwing the room into half-darkness. I see him—the man—standing by the shelves, his back to me. He’s holding a knife, small but sharp, the blade catching the light as he runs it along a wooden crate. The scrape matches his movements.He turns, slow, and his eyes lock on mine. His hood is down now, his face fully visible—gaunt, pale, with that scar twisting like a snake across his cheek. “You’re scared,” he says, his voice calm, almost soft. “You’re scared of me, aren’t you?” He steps forward, the knife loose in his hand, like he’s holding it just to show he can.I can’t move. My throat’s so tight I can barely breathe. “What do you want?” I choke out, my voice cracking. The broom feels useless, but I grip it anyway, holding it between us.He smiles, a thin, crooked thing that doesn’t reach his eyes. “Just wanted to talk. You’re always so busy, rushing around.” He takes another step, his boots heavy on the tiles. “Never time to sit, to listen.” The knife twirls in his fingers, casual, like he’s done this before.“Please,” I say, my voice shaking. “Just leave. I won’t tell anyone. I promise.” I hate how desperate I sound, how small.He tilts his head, like he’s considering it. “You won’t tell?” he says, mocking again. “Good girl.” He steps closer, and I back up, my shoulder hitting the doorframe. The open window behind him is my only shot—a small square high on the wall, barely big enough for me to fit through. I’d have to climb the crates, and he’s too close.I swing the broom, aiming for his arm. It connects with a dull thud, but he barely flinches, just grabs the handle and yanks it from my hands. It clatters to the floor, rolling under a shelf. “Don’t do that,” he says, his voice sharp now, all pretense gone. He steps closer, the knife raised slightly, not pointing at me yet, but close enough to make my skin crawl.I bolt for the window, scrambling onto a crate, my hands slipping on the dusty wood. I hear his boots behind me, quick, heavy. “Don’t!” he snaps, and I feel his hand graze my ankle as I pull myself up. I shove my shoulders through the window, the frame scraping my arms, and tumble into the alley outside. The pavement is cold, rough, and I scrape my palms as I catch myself. My phone’s in my pocket—I must’ve grabbed it from the counter without thinking. I fumble it out, dial 911, and run toward the street.“911, what’s your emergency?” the operator’s voice crackles.“There’s a man in my cafe with a knife!” I gasp, rattling off the address. My voice shakes, but I keep running, my sneakers pounding the pavement. The alley smells of garbage and damp brick. I reach the street, the streetlights bright after the dark. Headlights flash ahead—my friend’s car, right on time to pick me up. I wave my arms, nearly tripping, and the car screeches to a stop.“You okay?” my friend yells, jumping out. His face is pale, eyes wide as he sees me shaking.“No! He’s inside!” I point at the cafe, my hands trembling so hard I nearly drop the phone. I tell him everything—the man, the knife, the window—in broken sentences. Sirens wail in the distance, growing louder. Two police cars pull up minutes later, lights flashing red and blue. The officers move fast, one talking to me while the others go inside, guns drawn.I wait, leaning against my friend’s car, my breath ragged. The officer comes back after what feels like hours. “He’s gone,” he says, his face grim. “Found the knife on the floor in the back room. Looks like he climbed out the same window you did. Any idea who he was?”I shake my head, my stomach churning. They search the alley, the street, but find nothing. Later, at the station, they show me a photo. It’s him—same scar, same hollow eyes. They say he’s a known thief, in and out of jail, suspected in a string of small robberies. They think he was casing the cafe, maybe planning to take the register or worse. They don’t say it, but I know what “worse” means.I don’t sleep for days. Every sound makes me jump—the creak of my apartment floor, the hum of the fridge. I see his face when I close my eyes, that scar, that smile. I quit the cafe a week later. I couldn’t walk back into that back room, couldn’t stand under that flickering bulb. Even now, when I pass a cafe at night, I check the windows, my heart racing, half-expecting to see him there, sipping black coffee, waiting.

  




# ""The Last Light in Trémolat"":

I’m sitting at a small wooden table in the Café Village, the old stone building in Trémolat with its low wooden beams and cozy nooks that smell faintly of coffee and fresh bread. My coffee’s gone cold, the mug heavy in my hands, but I don’t mind. It’s late, well past 10 p.m., and the café is almost empty now, just me and a couple of locals nursing their drinks in the corner. Karen, my friend who works here part-time, is behind the counter, wiping it down with a rag, her movements slow, almost mechanical. The warm glow of the hanging lights casts long shadows on the walls, flickering every time someone passes the window outside. Something feels wrong tonight, like the air’s too thick, the silence too heavy.Karen’s been off for weeks. I’ve known her since she moved here from England over a decade ago, her laugh always filling this place, her dark hair tied back in a messy bun as she chatted with customers, pouring wine or sliding plates of croissants across the counter. She’s the kind of person who makes you feel at home, always asking about your day, remembering little details like how you take your coffee. But tonight, her eyes are distant, darting to the door every few minutes, and her hands tremble slightly as she stacks glasses. I lean forward, my elbows sticking to the table’s worn surface. “Hey, Karen, everything okay?” I ask, keeping my voice low, like I’m afraid to break the quiet.She freezes for a second, the rag still in her hand, and looks at me. Her face softens, but her smile doesn’t reach her eyes. “It’s nothing, really. Just... life, you know?” Her voice is tight, like she’s swallowing something she can’t say. I nod, but my stomach twists. I’ve heard the whispers around the village—gossip about her and Jean-François, the retired businessman who owns this café. People say they’ve been spending too much time together, their conversations too hushed, their glances too long. They say her husband, who’s always been quiet, doesn’t know. I push the thought away, but it sticks, like a splinter under my skin.The door chimes, sharp and sudden, making me jump. Jean-François walks in, his gray hair neatly combed, his suit crisp despite the late hour. He’s tall, with a kind of quiet confidence that fills the room. He nods at me, his eyes lingering a moment too long, then turns to Karen. “Everything set for tonight?” he asks, his voice low, almost a whisper. She nods, quick and nervous, her fingers twisting the rag. “Yeah, just a few locals coming. Should be fine.” Her words are clipped, and she doesn’t look at him. He mentions a wine tasting at his house later, something small, and she murmurs agreement, her eyes flicking to the floor. I watch them, my skin prickling, like I’m seeing something I shouldn’t.Jean-François leaves, the door swinging shut with a soft thud, and the café feels emptier without him. I sip my cold coffee, the bitterness sharp on my tongue. “You going to that wine tasting?” I ask, trying to sound casual, but my voice betrays me, a little too eager. Karen shrugs, stacking glasses with a clink. “Maybe. Jean-François says it’s no big deal, just some wine and talk.” She’s avoiding my eyes again, her hands moving faster now, like she’s trying to keep them busy. I want to ask more, to push her to tell me what’s wrong, but the café’s silence feels like a warning, the shadows on the walls stretching longer.By 11, the last customers leave, their chairs scraping against the wooden floor. The locals in the corner, two older men with weathered faces, nod at Karen as they go, muttering about the wine tasting. I linger, my coat draped over the chair, watching her clean. The café’s cozy vibe is gone now, replaced by something heavy, like the air before a fight. I stand, my chair creaking. “I can stay and help close up,” I offer. “Or walk you home.” Her house is just a few streets away, a short walk through the village’s narrow, cobblestone lanes, but the thought of her alone tonight makes my chest tight.She shakes her head, forcing a smile that looks more like a grimace. “I’m fine. It’s not far. You go on.” Her voice is firm, but her eyes are wide, almost pleading. I hesitate, my hand on the back of the chair, wanting to argue, to tell her I’ve got a bad feeling. But she turns away, busying herself with the cash register, and I feel like an intruder. “Alright,” I say, pulling on my coat. “Just... be careful, okay?” She nods, not looking at me, and I step outside, the cool air sharp against my face.The village is dark, the streetlights dim, casting pools of light that don’t reach the shadows. My footsteps echo as I walk home, the café’s glowing windows fading behind me. I glance back once, seeing Karen through the glass, locking the door, her face pale, her movements hurried. She waves, a small, quick gesture, and I wave back, but my stomach churns. I should’ve stayed.At home, I can’t sleep. My small house is too quiet, the creaks of the old wood too loud. I lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, replaying Karen’s nervous glances, the way Jean-François’s voice dropped when he spoke to her. The village has always been close-knit, but lately, it’s felt different—whispers about Karen, about her life, about secrets she might’ve kept. I think about the wine tasting, picturing her there, surrounded by people but still alone somehow.Around midnight, a scream rips through the silence. It’s sharp, raw, cutting straight to my bones. It’s coming from the direction of Karen’s house. My heart slams against my ribs, and I’m out of bed, pulling on shoes, my hands shaking so bad I can barely tie the laces. I grab my phone and run, the village a blur of dark houses and empty streets. The scream echoes in my head, loud and desperate, like someone fighting for their life.When I reach Karen’s street, my legs nearly give out. She’s there, crumpled on the ground outside her gate, her white blouse soaked with blood, dark and spreading. I drop to my knees beside her, my breath catching. “Karen!” I choke out, touching her arm. It’s cold, too cold. Her eyes are open, staring at the sky, lifeless, and there are wounds—deep, jagged cuts on her chest, her arms, her legs, her groin. Blood pools beneath her, glistening under the streetlight. I count eight wounds before I can’t look anymore, my stomach turning.I fumble for my phone, my fingers slick with sweat, and dial for help. “Please, someone’s hurt, she’s—Karen’s hurt, please hurry!” I stammer, my voice breaking. I look around, the darkness pressing in, every shadow a threat. I hear footsteps, quick and heavy, somewhere down the street, fading fast. My skin crawls, and I grip my phone tighter, my eyes scanning the empty road. Whoever did this is still out there, maybe watching.The police arrive, their lights flashing red and blue, cutting through the dark. They ask me questions—when I saw her last, what she said, who was at the café. I tell them everything: her nervous glances, Jean-François’s low voice, the wine tasting. An officer writes it all down, his face grim. They cover Karen’s body, but I can still see her in my mind, her blood on the cobblestones, her eyes empty. They say it was a frenzied attack, like someone hated her with everything they had.Days later, the village is a ghost of itself. The café reopens, but I can’t go back. The cozy nooks feel like traps now, the wooden beams looming like they’re hiding something. People whisper about Karen, about Jean-François, about a neighbor they questioned and let go. They talk about her husband, about secrets, about grudges. The police still don’t know who did it, and that’s the worst part. Every night, I lock my doors, check my windows, and listen for those footsteps I heard fading into the dark.

My ex GF who is and immigrant and Muslim and I have been together for almost 2 years and the relationship was wonderful. She was the best GF I ever had.  We discussed marriage but never came to an agreement as I needed to change to Islam and there was no other way as she said that the marriage would be denied and the Mosque would refuse to perform the marriage. 

My ex gf grew up different so she was very loving and did everything for me including cooking, cleaning and basically treated me like a king which no GF ever did. We were extremely close like best friend but because of the differences in beliefs and not being able to come an agreement with marriage. I ended it with her. My parents didn't approve of course and spoke of her like she was the worst person in the world. Both my x gf and parents refused to meet each other. My ex gf was honestly scared of them. She's soft hearted and was terrified that they would be rude to her. I was honest with her about how they feel. She's an amazing person and I still love her very much. 

2 months after the break up, I couldn't handle the pain and depression and started dating a woman that my parents said is a good fit. I decided to give it a try. There is no love between us but she's always liked me. I don't feel the same way about her and have only kissed her. I haven't slept with her. My ex gf found out and confronted me about it and then completely disappeared because she was extremely hurt. The feeling of depressed and hurt is overwhelming and I was never this hurt over any woman. I don't speak to my GF about my ex but she knows that I still love her and I refuse to speak of her becasue it hurts too much. My relationship is arranged for marriage. I want to get married. I've never had a real gf before my muslim gf. Just a bunch of users and cheaters. 

My gf and I ran into my ex GF at a coffee shop. She knew it was my x gfs favourite shop as I spoke about my x a lot in the first month. I was obsessed and extremely depressed. I still am but I hide it. She purposely starts holding me and want to kiss me in front of my x. My ex just looked down on her phone and refused to look my way. She starts laughing loud on purpose and it's like she wants to hurt my ex. My ex took her order to go and left. The second time we ran into her was at the mall. She purposely followed my ex into the same stores she went to show my ex gf that we are together now. I told her we should rather leave the store and don't want to accuse her of following my ex.  My ex went to buy ice cream and she stood in the same queue for ice cream, laughing loud and being flirtatious. I told her to stop it and she accuses me of trying to humiliate her in front of my ex. This is childish.

She seems very jealous of my ex gf. I felt like a horrible person and wasn't thinking. I could see the pain on my exes face. She looked other verge of crying and she probably thinks I was purposely following her to make her jealous. I only realized in the ice cream queue that my gf is doing it on purpose. I tried to reach out to my ex to apologize but her numbers are all changed and social media deactivated. We don't have any mutual friends. My ex gf doesn't have many friends as she's a quiet, introverted woman and doesn't like being friends with everyone. 

I don't really enjoy my gfs company. I find her boring but she listened when I spoke of my ex gf. Maybe I just needed someone to talk to. I don't speak about her anymore. I try to block her from my mind but there are nights I sob and go into shock that we aren't together. I want to get married and have children and I'm almost in my 40s. This is the only reason why I gave my gf a try.  It honestly isn't working and I want my ex back bit I cannot find her. She made herself unreachable. How do I fix this with my ex and if I do... what's the end result? We cannot get married. I want her as my wife but she's requesting me to be Muslim. She did say she doesn't mind me being Christian as a husband but the marriage will be rejected by the mosque and she wanted to perform the ceremony at the mosque.

If I do find her again, how do I approach her? I'm scared she won't forgive me. I have never slept with my current gf. I could never bring myself to do it. Even kissing my gf, my ex face comes in front of me and I feel guilty. I spent a lot of time with my current gf to get my mind off my ex. I know my x won't forgive this even so what about kissing. I love my ex so much. It stings and the fact that she's unreachable drives me insane. I can't believe I would even let my parent match me as they know I want to get married and start a family. I am inheriting a house from my grandfather's will and I promised my ex that we will stay together in the house. It's a large house and she always dreamed of staying in a 2 story house. She stays in a poor neighborhood in her country, in a small flat and I really want her to stay in this home as her mother or her never owned their own home. She came to the US to save money to buy a home in her country but because of me, she wanted to stay here. Now she wants absolutely nothing to do with me and I don't blame her. I tried to reach out to her best friend as well but she doesn't respond because my x told her not to :( she just blocked me. How can I convince my ex to come back. What can I do? I know she won't forgive me because she sees it as cheating. I know her. She doesn't forgive cheating. I can't get over her. Please help. Do I move on? She doesn't work at the same place any longer as well. She disappear completely :(

I just got back from a solo 6-day backpacking trip in the Accursed Mountains (Albanian Alps), and I’m still processing how much it shook me in the best way possible.

  
Day 1–2:

Landed in Tirana, grabbed a bus then a cramped minivan ride into the mountains. My goal was the Valbona–Theth trail, but the weather had other plans morning rain turned into misty afternoons. I trudged through dense forest, raincoat soaking, boots squelching. At one point I sat on a damp rock, looked up at silent peaks, and thought: I am small.

  
🛖 Shelter & people:

I wild camped near a shepherd’s hut, with only the bleating of goats as company. Two shepherds saw me in the morning and invited me in for coffee and homemade cornbread. No English just nods and smiles but it felt like a bridge built from kindness.

  
What kept me going:

Simple meals: oatmeal, instant soup, trail bars. A hot drink by the fire kept my spirits up.

Journaling: ten minutes before bed mostly about cold toes and wild light but it helped tame mental noise.

Playlist of ambient forest sounds: calibrated my pace to silence.

  
 Lessons I’m still carrying:

Nature’s unpredictability reminds you humility matters more than control.

Strangers in remote places can be your greatest allies.

Solitude doesn’t equal loneliness especially when your thoughts begin to feel like friends.

  
I came back with sore knees and a lighter pack (trimmed 500g mid-trail!), but also with gratitude I didn’t expect. If you’ve hiked in Albania or any lesser-known range, I’d love to hear your stories — any favorite hidden trails or shelters to check next?

  
And for those thinking: ""Maybe I'll go solo someday"" do it. The mountains don’t need you to conquer them. They just welcome you.0",4,1750844470.0,backpacking,1,0.83,False

The grinder has worked perfectly and I was more than happy with it. I have used it daily for espresso, flat whites, filter V60 and cold brew. Unfortunately the motor died, and after several repair attempts the Spanish store (complementosdelcafe.es) where I bought it has given me a full refund as it is within the 2 year warranty.

I am now looking for my next electric grinder (manually grinding my espresso every morning is not the best experience, even less with light-medium roast beans). I've had a Bambino Plus for almost 3 years, but I plan to upgrade to LaMarzocco Linea Micra in the near future, so I'm looking for a top of the line grinder.

My options are:

* **Varia VS6.** Trying Varia again, as the VS3 worked exceptionally well for me until its demise. I love the aesthetics and footprint. I like the workflow and am used to it. I can buy it for about 870€ brand new from the same local Spanish store where I bought the VS3, so I have 2 years warranty with good customer service.
* **Mazzer Philos.** The one that seems like the smart choice according to everyone on the internet. I like it less aesthetically and for dimensions, but everyone says a tank that should last for 1 decade (exactly what I expect when I spend close to 1000€ on a coffee grinder). I would buy it in the official Mazzer store, here in Spain the price is 1195€.

I am not worried about the warranty in the first 2 years, since if I get a bad unit in both cases I could process it without any problem. I am concerned about the reliability of Varia in the long term, after the second year (where the store warranty will be over). However, given the difference in price and the fact that the Varia is much more appealing to my eyes, I have doubts as to which is the better option. In addition, it seems that the Varia is more flexible (more burrs options, variable RPM)....",4,1750844075.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

1lk13qa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lk13qa,AIO for thinking that just bc I’m a SAHM I shouldn’t have to clean up after the entire household?,"I (34F) am temporarily being a stay at home mom with a 6 month old and a 4 year old (who starts VPK in the fall). We just moved to a new city and are sharing a 12-month lease with my boyfriend’s 23-year-old brother to save money. Not ideal, but my BF always lets family stay with us so 🥲 His brother *does* split bills. The two of them work full time. Their sister (27F) however, is a different story…

She was only supposed to stay a week before “new lease started” but oh look… it’s been 2 months and she’s still here. After about a month here she quit both her jobs in the span of a week. Her reasoning? “Them people had me fucked up. I’ll just find a new better job anyways” 🙃 welp it’s been a month and she spends her days day drinking at the beach bars, shopping, sleeping, gets food and alcohol delivered EVERY single day and it’s not like she’s in here now helping me with her niece and nephew whatsoever. The last few weeks she’s been constantly saying awful stuff to my 4 year old. She calls her a “roach,” “terrorist,” tells her she’s being “mean” or a “savage” and locks herself in the room. She’ll say something shitty to my daughter and two seconds later pick my baby up and speak baby voice to him like “awwwww THATS aunties babyyyyyyy”. Like wtf? I’ve had to repeatedly tell her to stop. Yesterday, my BF (who usually misses it all because he’s always at work) *finally* saw it firsthand and flipped tf out on her. He yelled and told her to stop immediately and asked her why she was getting personally offended by a FOUR yr olds normal behavior and not to speak to her like that again.

We’ve asked them both multiple times to clean up after themselves, but they still don’t wash or even put their dishes in the sink (and will cook and leave the kitchen disgusting and leave shit like leftover SALMON out to stink the place up), they leave blunts and weed out (I have no problem with smoking. I smoke when I’m not breastfeeding) instead of putting it in the room or in a drawer or something. They don’t take out the trash and will literally let the trash pile up to the ceiling if I let them. They’ve been leaving liquor bottles and shot glasses on the porch and kitchen counter and will leave things like knives on the counter and won’t listen to me when I repeatedly ask them to stop wearing shoes in the house. They’ll do things like go jog on the beach then walk inside with their sneakers still on and get sand from the beach everywhere. I’ve tried leaving the mess so they’d deal with it-doesn’t happen. It’ll get so disgusting that I cave and clean it bc I truly can’t live in an environment like that. It is so bad for my mental health. 

I feel like because I’m a SAHM they almost expect me to do all of this??? If that’s the case shouldn’t their sister be contributing now since she’s technically more jobless than me lol except she somehow has money to spend daily. I’m doing everything: cooking, cleaning after 6 ppl, exclusively breastfeeding, navigating life with a neurodivergent child as someone whos neurodivergent myself, handling all the appointments, keeping track of the bills, and my own health issues (POTS, long COVID, postpartum anxiety, chronic pain) my heart rate has been getting up to 140 (resting) lately bc I’m so stressed out. Tonight I walked into what they think is *their private bathroom* (even though it’s the bathroom closest to the living room and is the primary bathroom lol) and it was actually disgusting. I’m appalled that anyone could live like this and that someone could have the audacity to be a guest in someone’s home, sibling or not, and let it get filthy like this. 

Are my expectations unreasonable? Like…is this just me being naggy or me letting my OCD get the best of me? Idk I’m a SAHM, not a maid.

It's essentially controlled spoilage for tasty and ofen beneficial results!

I think the coolest thing is learning how diverse fermentation is. We often think of beer and bread, but kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha, and even some types of coffee all rely on it. It really highlights how different microbes contribute to different flavor profiles and chemical changes.

We met online during the pandemic, built a routine of daily calls, late-night laughs, and virtual movie nights and then finally decided to meet in person last week.

The airport moment:

I landed 2 hours early out of nerves. When I saw them at baggage claim, my hands shook, my heart raced. It felt like meeting a stranger... until they hugged me, and suddenly we were exactly where we belonged. It was like all those Zoom calls finally got a body and a heartbeat.

The next days:

We didn’t dive into grand plans just simple things felt magical: holding hands walking to the car, sharing coffee in awkward silence, their hair finally soft under my fingers. Within a few hours, all that ""first meeting anxiety"" melted into this natural comfort, exactly like many of your stories describe:

“It felt like meeting up after a separation peaceful and electric at the same time.”

“We hugged for a while, felt surreal, but then everything just felt like home.”

A random moment I’ll never forget:

On day two, we were brushing our teeth in the morning and just laughed because it felt like domestic life had landed out of the blue. We both looked at each other and said, “Is this real?” It’s those tiny, mundane moments that suddenly matter the most.

After it ended:

Leaving was brutally hard tears, hugs, lingering at the gate. But everyone here warned me:

“The hellos are amazing, but the goodbyes hit harder.”

They were right. But also true: the memory of those days keeps me going until I can be with them again.",2,1750843502.0,LongDistance,1,1.0,False

I'm 27 and work as an industrial designer in Newcastle, my pay is $75k/year at the moment and I've been there 3 years. I'm anxious about my future because the only way I see myself having any career and serious salary progression is to work for myself or changing careers. I started on $32/hr in 2022 and I'm on $36/hr now.  
  
All the jobs I see advertised with pay listed are in higher cost of living areas, paying equal or less, and wanting 3-5 years experience. I really love the work but the discipline has an oversupply of fresh graduates deflating the salary for the whole industry, and highly technical manufacturing in this country is largely so engineering driven that industrial designers aren't required. Breville and Rode Microphones are like the two companies I can think of in this country where they advertise for industrial design roles above $100,000. 

When I got my job after finishing Uni I moved back in with my parents, thinking it would be temporary for a couple of months but I've been here for 3 years now. I've managed to save $64k in the house deposit account and 5k in an account to replace my car. To work for myself, I think I'd need at very least space for some capital investments in machinery and tooling, for that I think I need to either buy a house with a garage or to rent a workshop.   
  
Realistically if I were to buy a 3 bedroom house in an outer suburb I'd be looking at at least \~$700,000. Even If I managed to save a 20% deposit ($140,000, more than twice my current savings) I'd still be looking at $842/week of repayments leaving me with $286/week to cover everything else. 

Granted this is doing it on my own, I'm single and have been for the past 5 years, but moving out with the hope that that makes finding a partner easier would seriously effect my ability to save. I don't run an incredibly tight budget but the breakdown is roughly 50% savings, 30% fixed expenses (Board + additional groceries, petrol, phone bill, insurance), 20% fair game.

When I was living on my own rent + groceries + bills was easily $600/week combined.  I could probably manage $350/week into savings if I moved out but that would be a super tight budget, maybe $150 left over each week and that would have to cover longer term expenses like car rego and CTP as well. My only financial vices at the moment are a kilo of single origin coffee a fortnight at $60 and takeaway or a pub meal once a week.

Sure there's economies of scale with a partner but I feel like approaching dating with financial security or looking good on a balance sheet as your number one priority is not the healthiest way to do it.   
  
I don't see a path forwards for the lifestyle I want with no changes to my circumstances in the short term - any obvious things I could be doing better? Career change to something better paying seems like the only realistic option for me.

# Chapter 1 Her Regret

In the empty room, Jessica Atkinson held a paintbrush in her hand, listening to her mother's weary voice over the phone.

Stella Grant said, ""Jessi, have you thought about what we talked about last time? Your grandfather's seriously ill. You're the only child your dad and I have. Are you really still not coming home to take over the company?""

In the dim light, Jessica added the final stroke to a painting of a family of three.

Just as Stella thought she'd failed to convince her daughter again, Jessica suddenly spoke, ""Okay.""

Stella froze, clearly caught off guard. ""Y-you're saying yes?""

""Yes."" Jessica's voice was calm. ""I'll do it. But I need some time to wrap things up here. I'll be back in 15 days.""

After a few more words, she ended the call.

Jessica stepped out of the room and looked down at the three people in the living room.

Her eyes landed on the man sitting on the couch—Brian Atkinson. His features were striking, sharp without being harsh.

He had a quiet, restrained kind of presence. His shirt and slacks were perfectly tailored, the collar buttoned all the way to the top. He looked every bit the picture of elegance and control.

This was Jessica's husband, the man she had insisted on marrying even though it meant turning down her family's arrangement and cutting ties with them.

In Hartdale, Brian held tremendous power and was always serious and distant. People around him saw him as cold and untouchable, yet now he was speaking to another woman in a gentle tone.

Beside them, a boy around five years old with delicate features, Jacob Atkinson, threw himself into the woman's arms. Blinking his wide eyes, he said sweetly, ""Maddie, I want fish casserole. Will you make it for me?""

Madeline Houghton tapped his nose with a fond smile. ""Of course.""

Jacob's eyes lit up, clearly thrilled. He remarked, ""Maddie, you're the best. Not like my mom—she never lets me eat too much."" As he spoke, he even pouted a little.

Madeline smiled and gently coaxed him, ""Then you've got to eat a little extra today, Jake.""

Jacob nodded with a warm chuckle. ""Maddie, I wish you were my real mom.""

Madeline's smile deepened.

Upstairs, Jessica felt a dull ache in her chest. She always thought kids tended to overeat when they liked something. She only watched Jacob's diet because she didn't want him to get sick. That was all.

Jessica didn't feel like watching any longer. That was her husband and her son, but somehow, the three of them looked more like a real family. She was the one who seemed out of place.

She turned around and went back into the room.

Not long after, footsteps came from outside. Madeline walked in. Her makeup was flawless, her smile gentle. ""Jessi, come downstairs with me. Let's celebrate Jake's birthday together.""

Madeline used to be Jessica's intern. She came from a poor background and was barely competent.

Jessica had once listened to Madeline cry about her past, saying that if she still couldn't find a job, she would have no choice but to go back to her hometown and get married.

Jessica had felt sorry for her and brought her into the company. She never imagined she'd end up bringing in the very woman who would destroy her family.

Madeline had studied her, mimicked her, and tried to take her place—to become the new Mrs. Atkinson. By the time Jessica realized it, Madeline had already made her way into the household, getting along perfectly with her husband and son.

Jessica had long seen through the mask Madeline wore and had hated herself for bringing trouble into her own home. Jessica said coldly, ""I'm not feeling well. I'm not going.""

Madeline spoke with feigned innocence, ""Jessi, you're Jake's mom. It would mean a lot to him if you said happy birthday to him.""

Jessica frowned, about to turn her down again. But then something crossed her mind, and she let out a sigh.

She figured this was between her and Madeline. Jacob was still just a child who shouldn't be affected by it. As his mother, Jessica felt it was only right to wish him a happy birthday.

With that thought, she set down her paintbrush and walked downstairs, brushing past Madeline's shoulder, completely ignoring her.

For a split second, Madeline's smile froze. A flicker of malice passed through her eyes, but she quickly followed after.

When Jessica saw Brian and Jacob, she paused.

Ten years ago, she'd joined the Atkinson Group to challenge herself and met Brian there. They'd fought, teased, and fallen into marriage. She had rejected her family's carefully laid plans and insisted on marrying Brian, even cutting ties with them to do it.

For the past ten years, she'd never once regretted her decision. Her husband was rich, handsome, and he treated her well. Their son was smart and adorable. She had once truly believed she had a happy life.

But then, Jessica looked at Madeline, who was smiling attentively as she served food to Brian and Jacob. Madeline's presence had changed everything that once felt so perfect.

Jessica silently picked up her fork to eat, but then a wave of nausea hit her. She quickly put the fork down and rushed to the bathroom, gagging over the sink.

Brian stood up, looking concerned, about to follow her, but Madeline stopped him in a flurry of panic.

She clutched his sleeve, her eyes wide with worry. ""Mr. Atkinson, what's going on with Jessi?""

Brian spoke gently, trying to reassure her, ""She's been like this lately. It's nothing. Don't worry.""

After saying that, he turned to look at Jessica and sneered coldly, ""What's the excuse this time? A cold? Or is the food at home not good enough?""

Jessica didn't respond. She wiped the corner of her mouth with a tissue and thought, 'If I said I was pregnant, would they even believe me?

'Forget it. I'm leaving soon anyway. Why bother telling them? No need to ruin the sweet little bond between my husband and his mistress.'

Even as a secretary, Madeline still dared to chide her boss, speaking in a syrupy tone, ""Mr. Atkinson, don't say that about Jessi. Maybe she really isn't feeling well. She's lost a lot of weight lately.""

Then she stood up, made a cup of hot chamomile tea, and handed it to Jessica. ""Jessi, are you okay? Here, have some chamomile tea.""

Still nauseous and not wanting to see Madeline's face, Jessica grew irritated and pushed her away.

She hadn't even used much force, but Madeline let herself fall with the motion, and the hot chamomile tea spilled onto her own hand.

""Ow!"" Madeline cried out.

""Maddie,"" Brian and Jacob called out at the same time. They instantly rushed to her side, their eyes full of concern as they looked at her hand which was scalded red.

Jacob's eyes welled with tears, feeling sorry for her. ""Maddie, does it hurt a lot?""

Madeline forced a smile and tried to look strong. ""It's okay, Jake. I was just being careless. It doesn't hurt.""

Brian glared at Jessica, his eyes blazing. His voice was like ice. ""What are you trying to pull now?""

Jessica was overwhelmed with sadness and disappointment. She caught the smug look in Madeline's eyes, then saw her own son standing in front of Madeline like a little protector. Jessica shut her eyes in despair and said, ""I didn't do anything.""

But Brian didn't believe her. When the family doctor arrived, Brian helped Madeline sit down, letting her lean against his chest. There was disappointment in his deep-set eyes as well.

He said accusingly, ""Jessi, you've changed. You were never the kind of person to do something like this out of jealousy.""

Jessica thought, 'I've changed? Yeah, I have.'

Ten years ago, she wouldn't have had stretch marks from childbirth. Her skin wouldn't have gone dull from staying up all night.

And she definitely wouldn't have quit her job and become a housewife just because of Brian's words—only to be replaced by another woman.

Jessica suddenly felt exhausted. She held back the explanation she almost gave and turned to head upstairs.

Right before entering her room, she looked back down at the chaotic scene below and gave one last glance at the husband and son she had once loved with everything she had.

Brian and Jacob were still the same, hovering around Madeline, the three of them tangled up like they couldn't bear to be apart.

Jessica gave a bitter smile and shook her head. Then she gently touched her belly and set a countdown on her phone. Without a trace of hesitation, she turned and went back into the room.

From this moment on, she wouldn't disturb them again.

# Chapter 2 She Was Done Playing Along

The noise outside gradually faded. Jessica didn't bother to check what was going on out there. With her earplugs and sleep mask on, she slept straight through to morning.

Since she'd already decided to return and claim her inheritance, she had to resign from Atkinson Group.

After giving birth to Jacob, she had rarely shown up at the company. But back when Brian had taken over the family business, she had been right there beside him, helping him build everything from the ground up.

Atkinson Group's rise to the number-one spot in the country had a lot to do with her. So even though she didn't come in regularly, she still received a generous annual bonus and profit share.

Early in the morning, Jessica looked at herself in the mirror. Her thick, wavy hair framed a flawless face. She was stunning, but her eyes carried no light.

She had always been beautiful. Even after becoming a stay-at-home mom, even after all the sleepless nights and labor, her looks had barely changed.

But the morning sickness, the emotional strain, and the cold treatment from her family had taken their toll. Her eyes were dull, lifeless—like fish washed up on the shore.

On the top floor of Atkinson Group, Jessica was waiting for her resignation papers to be printed.

Just then, a few employees behind her started chatting, their voices drifting into earshot.

One said, ""Did you see Madeline's Instagram post?""

Another asked, ""No, what did she post this time?""

Someone else added, ""She posted a bunch of stuff. Looks like she was throwing someone a birthday party. You should check it out.""

They were laughing as they teased each other, but when they looked up and saw Jessica, their smiles froze.

One of them gasped, ""Ms. Grant?""

Another asked, ""Ms. Grant, what brings you here to the office?""

Jessica gave a casual nod. As soon as the employees finished greeting her, they dashed away in a hurry. More whispers followed as they left.

Someone sneered, ""What a buzzkill. What's the executive secretary Jessica doing back here at the company?""

Another said sarcastically, ""She's already the CEO's wife. What's the point of showing off in front of us?""

Someone else snorted, ""I don't think Mr. Atkinson's that close to her anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if they're getting a divorce.""

Jessica didn't react. She had never been popular in the company and had long gotten used to this kind of talk.

If she hadn't gone through so much workplace bullying in the past—if Brian hadn't stepped in and helped her so many times—she wouldn't have fallen for him to begin with.

Bored from waiting, Jessica opened Instagram on her phone. The first thing that popped up was a nine-photo post from Madeline.

The first image was taken at Jacob's birthday party last night. The decorations were extravagant, and the giant three-tier cake in the center was impossible to miss.

What caught Jessica's eye was a photo taken in a hospital. Three hands, all different sizes, stacked on top of each other—it looked so warm and loving.

Jessica thought, 'It was just a burn. Why'd they go to the hospital again?'

She found it ridiculous and scrolled through the comments. Most of them were full of envy and well-wishes.

One comment read: \[Wow, a birthday party for the little one? Looks so happy.\]

Another joked: \[Showing off again—so who's your husband anyway? Not gonna show your bestie?\]

Someone else wrote: \[No matter what happens, as long as the family's together, that's what really matters.\]

Jessica was speechless. She knew Madeline had posted those on purpose, just to get under her skin and push her into snapping at Brian.

If it had been before, Jessica really wouldn't have been able to stand this pretentious act, watching her own husband and son leave her at home to care for a woman who had done nothing but poorly imitate her from the start.

But now that she was about to leave, she naturally didn't care anymore.

Jessica gave a dry smile and tapped the screen lightly to give the post a like.

After getting her resignation papers, Jessica went straight to the CEO's office and handed them to Brian's current personal assistant.

The people in the Secretary's Office, just like the ones who had been whispering earlier, looked down on her for showing up as if she were trying to brag. But the moment they saw the resignation papers, they gasped in shock.

Someone asked, ""I-I didn't read that wrong, did I?""

""Ms. Grant is quitting?"" another exclaimed.

The assistant froze, visibly panicked. ""M-Ma'am, Mr. Atkinson is in a very important meeting right now. Maybe we should wait and let him have a look at these until he's done.""

""No need. I'm just a figurehead executive secretary. You have the authority to process this. No need to bother him,"" Jessica said with a light smile.

People around them sighed under their breath.

""Is the rumor true? Jessica and Mr. Atkinson are getting a divorce? And the other woman is Madeline?""

""Why Madeline? Doesn't she have a family?""

""Are you dumb? Did you even see that Instagram post? That hand is clearly Mr. Atkinson's. Who else in Hartdale could wear a Rolex that expensive?""

""Exactly. Didn't you notice Madeline took over all of Jessica's work after she went on maternity leave?""

""Now that Jessica's quitting, maybe she's handing the position over.""

Jessica knew exactly how nosy these people were. In the past, hearing things like this would've crushed her. She would've curled up in bed at night, crying quietly under the covers.

But now, she suddenly realized that once she let it go, none of it really mattered.

She smiled at everyone like she couldn't hear a word and said, ""Thank you all for your hard work these past ten years. I hope Atkinson Group continues to thrive for many more to come.""

Everyone fell silent in embarrassment. Only then did Jessica return to her desk and begin packing up everything she'd accumulated over the years.

She had worked here for ten years, and her workspace was filled to the brim with books she'd bought when she first started out and notes she'd taken while learning to understand Brian as his secretary.

On one page, it clearly said: ""1. He needs a cup of hand-ground coffee every morning. 2. He hates being late. 3. He doesn't allow any woman to wear perfume around him.""

There were many notes like that. Every single one of them had been built with Jessica's effort.

She had poured so much into doing her job as a secretary well, but people always assumed the role was just a man's plaything—that all it took was a body, not a brain.

Only Brian had seen her working late into the night—reviewing contracts, building presentations, digging into the background on every competitor of Atkinson Group, and reciting business reports like they were second nature.

It was because she worked hard enough that someone as untouchable as Brian had come down from his pedestal to get close to her.

Jessica had once believed Brian was the one person who truly understood her. She was wrong. After ten years, all those memories and feelings had turned to dust.

She focused on packing her things. Just then, the meeting ended, and Madeline walked out first.

She had been beaming, but the moment she saw Jessica, her smile froze. Madeline thought, 'Why is Jessica here? Did she see my Instagram post? Is she here to lose it on me?

Just thinking about it made her excited. She went back to her desk, restless, waiting for the storm to hit. On the outside, though, she kept her head down, her eyes turning red, like she'd just been horribly wronged.

Brian was the last to walk out. As he passed the Secretary's Office, he saw Jessica there at the office.

Her desk was the closest to his office, a setup that once symbolized her status and their past affection.

But now, just the sight of her annoyed him especially when she looked like she was in a good mood, flipping through a book with a faint smile on her face.

Right next to her, Madeline sat with her head down, looking dejected, quietly dabbing at her tears with a tissue.

Brian frowned, tapped the corner of Jessica's desk, and ordered, ""Come in.""

Jessica looked up, calm and composed. ""Okay.""

Once she stepped inside, Brian got straight to the point. ""The company doesn't need you right now. If there's no special reason, don't come to Atkinson Group again.""

# Chapter 3 Mrs. Atkinson

Jessica froze. No matter how many times she'd been disappointed by Brian, every time she heard his cold tone, it still felt like a knife stabbing straight into her chest.

Her eyes lowered, and the smile on her face disappeared. ""Okay.""

Brian had expected Jessica to lash out, but he hadn't thought she'd give in so easily. Only then did he actually look at her.

He noticed Madeline was right—Jessica really had lost a lot of weight lately.

He thought, 'Maybe Jessica really was throwing up last night because she wasn't feeling well. Maybe she wasn't being jealous in front of Madeline after all.'

His lips pressed together, and his tone softened slightly. ""Madeline's been doing your job well. Your focus now should be taking care of Jake. I've explained this to you so many times—there's nothing between me and her.

""Jessi, stop making trouble. Don't make me regret choosing you to be my wife.""

Jessica thought, 'Regret? I regret it too. I really regret giving up my family's business just to become this so-called Mrs. Atkinson. The Grant family has real status. Grant Group is powerful. I could've gone back and been the heiress everyone doted on instead.'

Jessica closed her eyes and calmly pulled out her resignation letter. Her tone was polite but distant. ""Mr. Atkinson, then please go ahead and approve this. I'll officially resign starting tomorrow.""

With that, she turned to leave. But just as she reached the door, Brian grabbed her arm.

""Jessica?"" Brian sounded surprised, as if he hadn't fully processed what was happening. Holding the resignation in one hand, he instinctively reached out and caught her.

He stared at her signature on the resignation letter. His face darkened as he held back a surge of anger. ""You're doing this to spite me? I thought you came today to make peace, but now you're taking it even further?""

""No, Mr. Atkinson. You said Atkinson Group didn't need me, and it just so happens—I feel the same."" Jessica kept her gaze lowered, her thick lashes trembling slightly. ""It's been ten years. Atkinson Group isn't what it used to be.

""Since everyone clearly loves Madeline, I figured I might as well step down now instead of holding a position and collecting a paycheck for doing nothing.""

Brian let out a cold laugh. His eyes were sharp, like he could see straight through her excuse. ""Don't use the past ten years to guilt me. I know Atkinson Group wouldn't be what it is today without you. You were a great employee.

""But Jessica, ever since you had the baby, you haven't been involved in any business matters. I've been nothing but considerate. All you have to do is take care of our son, and you'll always be the lady of Atkinson Group.

""You can't even handle something this simple, and now you say you're stepping aside? All you're doing is putting Madeline in a difficult position. Jessica, I know you too well. You're calculating, but don't be cruel. Since last night, have you even apologized to Maddie?""

Jessica thought, 'Apologize? I'm supposed to apologize to the woman who wrecked my home? Shouldn't she be the one thanking me?'

Suddenly, Jessica let out a laugh and looked at Brian with a hint of curiosity. ""Yes, I'm cruel. Mr. Atkinson, have you never considered giving up?""

The kind of giving up she meant was divorce.

Over the past few years, whenever Brian and Jessica fought, she brought up divorce again and again, and every time it ended in an ugly stalemate.

Brian had never agreed. In his eyes, even if he cheated, Jessica was still his wife.

That was always how it was with Brian—domineering and controlling, a man who held power over all of Hartdale.

As for Jessica, at the beginning, she hadn't really meant to leave. She had been acting out, like Brian said, hoping he'd actually care more about her.

But now, she was tired. She was fine with getting a divorce and going their separate ways. She even thought about the kids. They could each take one, and that would be that.

Brian's face darkened, his grip on her arm tightening like he could snap her in half. ""This is your last chance, Jessica. If you mess up again, I won't hesitate to find Jake a new mom.

""Do you know how many times he's complained to me he has no joy or freedom living with you? Why are you such a failure as both a wife and a mother?""

The word ""failure"" made her close her eyes and let out a long breath.

Jessica thought, 'So that's how it is. Waiting up all night for Brian to come home and making him hangover cures was a failure. Hand-washing his designer suits in the dead of winter until my hands were raw was a failure.

'Tutoring Jake through elementary math, raising a child who fit the Atkinson family's image of an heir was a failure. This home really has no place for me anymore.'

""I'm sorry, Mr. Atkinson,"" Jessica said sincerely. She believed someone who failed should take a final bow and leave the stage.

Her other hand slipped into her coat pocket and tapped her phone screen. The countdown began—there were fourteen days left.

Once everything was in order, she would disappear completely. Brian would never have to be annoyed by her again.

Jessica's attitude caught Brian off guard. He still wanted to say something, but she didn't give him the chance and turned to leave.

She walked away without hesitation. Brian reached out again, but caught nothing.

Suddenly, a sharp pain clenched in his chest, a wave of panic rising fast and hard.

He frowned, watching her disappear down the hall, a strange sense growing stronger—that something important was slipping further and further away from him.

Once outside, Jessica called her best friend, Gabriela Clark. They were besties, though they hadn't spoken in over six years.

Gabriela was a fashion designer, constantly flying around the country, tailoring clothes for different models. A lot of them were male, and with adults working in close quarters, it wasn't unusual for things to happen.

Put plainly, Gabriela went through boyfriends like outfits. Brian had always hated that about her. After Jessica had their child, he'd told her to stay away from Gabriela, said she'd be a bad influence on Jacob.

So Jessica had listened and cut ties with the friend she grew up with for six whole years.

After not hearing from Jessica for years, Gabriela was furious. She picked up and snapped, ""So you finally remembered I exist? Jessica, I thought you were way too far gone in your lovesick haze. And now you finally call—what, regretting it already?""

Jessica let out a helpless laugh, tears falling before she even noticed.

She hadn't cried when Brian humiliated her, hadn't cried when Madeline made a fool of her, not even when the child she carried for nine months called someone else Mom. But with Gabriela, Jessica sobbed in regret.

""Yes, I regret it,"" Jessica said. ""Gabi, if I come back now, is it too late?""

On the other end of the line, Gabriela went quiet for a long time after hearing Jessica's sincere words. When she finally spoke again, her voice was choked with tears.

She said, ""I'm just glad you've come to your senses. You idiot, do you have any idea how exhausting it's been running the studio for you all these years? The entire art world's been waiting for your return.

""Jessica, being a CEO's secretary only buried your talent. You were born to be an artist—you're the last true gem of the Impressionist world. Jessi, I've been waiting for you this whole time.""

""I'm sorry, Gabi. I'm so sorry."" Jessica crouched down in the middle of the street, crying.

Jessica was always meant to be proud. She had been brilliant and talented from the start. Even Brian didn't know that she had studied fine art at a university in Fiorenelle, a city in Aurevia.

Her very first graduation piece had made it into the Viremont Grand Biennale, shocking the entire art world.

After graduation, the paintings she signed off on had sold at auction for more than a million dollars.

And yet, for the sake of so-called experience, she came back to the country and started over in a job that had nothing to do with her field. She studied admin, finance, and business management from scratch and still excelled at it.

She gave up painting for ten years. But today, she had finally decided—she was going back.

# Chapter 4 Her Ungrateful Son

After agreeing on a time with Gabriela to take over the studio, Jessica returned to Atkinson Villa.

She had given herself a 15-day countdown because ten years had left too many things unresolved. She couldn't just walk away. There were still matters to handle.

The most important of all was everything inside Atkinson Villa.

The massive villa, over 5,000 square feet, had no housekeepers simply because Brian thought they were too noisy. The daily cleaning had always fallen to Jessica.

Now that she was leaving, she intended to step down like the perfect secretary she'd always been. It was a matter of pride—as the heiress of the Grant family.

Madeline clearly wasn't the type to do housework, so Jessica had to find a qualified housekeeper for her husband and child.

During the day, Jessica interviewed several candidates, having each of them cook according to Brian's preferences. In the evening, as she was eating at home, an urgent voice came from the front door. ""Chester, call the family doctor. Now."" It was Brian.

Jessica, being pregnant, was especially sensitive to the smell of blood, and the air immediately made her nauseous.

She frowned, an instinctive worry rising. 'What happened? Is he hurt?' she pondered.

She instinctively started toward the door, only to see Brian hurrying in, carrying a woman in his arms. It was winter in Hartdale, snow falling steadily, soaking his hair and shoulders, but he didn't seem to notice.

He laid the woman down on the couch and barked, furious, ""Where is the family doctor? Hurry up.""

Jessica didn't even need to see the woman's face to know who she was. It was Madeline.

Wrapped in her thick robe, Jessica stood to the side and calmly asked, ""What happened to her?""

They had just argued in the morning. Brian glanced at Jessica but didn't seem interested in talking to her. His voice was filled with annoyance. ""She ran into some loan sharks and took a stab to the shoulder.""

""Loan sharks? Whose debt?"" Jessica asked, curious. She thought, 'What, has the CEO of Atkinson Group gone bankrupt?'

Before Brian could respond, Madeline, pale and weak, spoke up in a pitiful voice, ""I'm sorry, Jessi. It's my fault. My dad owes gambling debts, and somehow those people found out I was Mr. Atkinson's secretary.

""They waited on a dark road tonight and tried to kidnap me. I fought back and got hurt. Luckily, Mr. Atkinson was working late and happened to be there. If he hadn't shown up and saved me, I might've been killed.""

""Don't say things like that,"" Brian said sharply. ""As long as I'm around, no one will lay a finger on you. But your place isn't safe for now. I've already called the police. Until they catch those men, you'll stay at Atkinson Villa.""

""No."" Jessica didn't hesitate at all.

Hearing that, Brian looked up at her.

Jessica seemed in good spirits. Maybe it was because she had quit her job and reconnected with her best friend. Her cheeks were rosy, her skin glowing. She wore a soft silk robe, standing there lazily, full of charm.

Brian had been irritable since morning, but hearing Jessica's flat rejection actually calmed him down.

He turned his head, sneering with what looked like mockery. He thought, 'Just like I thought. Another game of push and pull. She acts like she's indifferent, but deep down she's still jealous of Madeline.'

His tone turned low and warning. ""Jessica, this is Atkinson Villa."" He was the one who owned this place. Whoever got to stay here was up to him.

""She still can't stay,"" Jessica said firmly. ""There aren't enough rooms. She has nowhere to sleep.""

Atkinson Villa was big, spanning three full floors, but there were only three actual bedrooms.

One room was for Jacob, one for Jessica, and one for Brian. That was all there was.

There used to be extra guest rooms in Atkinson Villa, but back when Jessica and Brian were newlyweds and still happy, Brian had had them all remodeled.

There was a luxurious nursery, a walk-in closet, a display room for luxury goods, and spaces Jessica used to pass the time—like a flower room, an art studio, and a yoga room. But there were no extra bedrooms.

In fact, the third bedroom was planned by Brian for their second child in the future. But back then, they never imagined that one day they'd be sleeping apart because of emotional distance.

Brian hadn't expected Jessica to reject Madeline's stay for this reason. His face instantly darkened.

His voice was tight, like he was clenching his teeth. ""Jessica, you sleep in the master bedroom.""

The implication was clear—they could share a bed. After all, no matter how strained things had gotten, just three months ago, they had still slept together. That was how Jessica ended up pregnant.

But Jessica didn't care. That night had only happened because Brian was drunk three months ago. Back then, her feelings had been a tangled mess of love and resentment. Now, neither was left. There was no reason for them to be intimate anymore.

Jessica stood her ground, stubborn and unmoving, and the sight of it made Brian's anger boil over.

At that moment, Jacob came downstairs, still groggy from sleep. ""Dad, Mom, what's going on? I heard you two arguing again.""

He spoke with a pouty, wronged tone, then glanced over and saw Madeline on the couch, still bleeding as her wound was being treated. He snapped to attention. ""Maddie.""

Jacob ran over quickly. ""Maddie, what happened? Why are you hurt? Does it hurt? Are you okay?""

Madeline smiled, patting his head, ""It's nothing, Jake. Be good and go back to bed.""

""I'm not going. You're hurt. I'm not sleeping until you're better."" Jacob was still a clingy child, and he clung to Madeline without letting go.

Seeing how much he liked Madeline, Jessica suddenly curved her lips into a smile. ""Jake, don't worry. Maddie might be staying with us for the next few days.

""But since we don't have enough bedrooms, would it be okay if Maddie sleeps in your room with you?""

""Really?"" Jacob's eyes widened, full of excitement and joy. ""Yeah, that'd be—""

Halfway through, he quickly clamped his hand over his mouth. ""No, I didn't mean it like that, Mom.""

Jacob thought, 'I totally forgot. Mom hates it when I act like I love Maddie. The last time I stayed out playing with Maddie too long and forgot to come home, Mom got super mad.

'After that, Dad told me I shouldn't let Mom see how much I love Maddie.'

""It's okay. You can mean it,"" Jessica said quietly, her voice soft as her cold hands beneath the robe rested gently over her belly.

Today, she finally understood what it meant to give birth to an ungrateful child.

Jessica still remembered the day Jacob was born. She'd gone through a long labor for nearly two days. The doctors had said she might not survive and told Brian he had to choose whether to save the mother or the baby.

Brian's eyes had been bloodshot, screaming outside the OR that he only wanted Jessica.

But Jessica had refused. In tears, she'd begged the doctors to save the baby. She'd said she could give up everything, anything—just not the child she shared with Brian.

In the end, she'd pulled through on sheer will, giving birth to Jacob naturally without a single dose of anesthesia.

Jessica gave up her career to raise Jacob herself, day in and day out. And now, what she got in return was a child who favored another woman and wanted a different mom.

Jessica was really tired. She hadn't even wanted to keep the baby she was carrying. When she got the results from last week's checkup, her first instinct had been to give it up.

Her life felt too hopeless. She hadn't planned on having another child with Brian.

But when she thought about leaving, Jessica started to feel a glimmer of hope. She thought that maybe this time, without the Atkinson family holding her back, she and her child could grow freely and things might be better.

With that thought, Jessica stopped looking back and walked away.

Jacob didn't understand why his mom was acting this way. He stood frozen, watching her leave, silent for a long time, and then suddenly burst into tears.

He was a sensitive kid. Even if he didn't understand anything, something deep in his blood told him he was being left behind.

His sudden crying startled Madeline. She quickly hugged him and tried to comfort him, ""Jake, don't cry. I'm right here. Don't be scared.""

She looked at Brian, nervous, her eyes brimming with tears like she was silently accusing Jessica of making Jacob cry again.

Brian's face was grim. He looked up toward the second floor, his eyes brooding. But in the end, he didn't say a word.

# Chapter 5 She'd Had Enough

Jessica slept through the night without dreams. The next morning, when she came downstairs planning to make herself breakfast, she smelled food the moment she reached the stairs.

It was Madeline. She had already made breakfast for the whole family and was now grinding coffee for Brian by hand.

When she saw Jessica, she smiled and greeted her, ""Jessi, you're up. Come on, I made sandwiches. I'm not sure if you'll like them.""

""Maddie's cooking is great. Who wouldn't like it?"" Jacob chimed in with a bright smile, then sneaked a glance at Jessica. There was a flicker of fear in his expression. He was afraid of his mother, and he resented her too.

He felt like Jessica had suddenly become a different person. He didn't understand why she had looked at him with such a cold expression before.

Every time Jacob praised Maddie in the past, it would set Jessica off, making her try harder to be good to him—just so he could use that as a chance to slack off from all his tutoring sessions.

Jessica could more or less guess what her son was thinking. She let out a faint, mocking smile and thought, 'Does he really think I, his mother, can't see through a kid's little tricks?'",1,1750842666.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

---  

## **The Continuing Adventures of Mouse Capone presents “The Hat”**

*A story of borrowed swagger, tested loyalty, and ill-fitting greatness.*

---

### **ACT I – The Hat Is Left**

Mouse Capone steps into a dusty little desert post office to “handle correspondence of a delicate nature.”

Before leaving, he sets down **his hat** on the saloon table.
A rare event.
A mythic occurrence.

His crew—the ragtag bunch that travels with him now and again—freeze. No one speaks.
The hat sits.
The air around it *changes.*
It casts a shadow it shouldn’t.

Blue Puppy inches forward first. “He never leaves it behind…”

Rudy, the lizard mechanic, mutters: “That hat’s seen more bullets than a Wild West telegram.”
Minx the Lynx, the sleuth, eyes it like a loaded deck.

Then, slowly, reverently, Blue Puppy reaches for it.

---

### **ACT II – The Hat’s Influence**

#### **Blue Puppy**

He places the hat on his head—and *shlomp!*
His posture straightens.
His tail stills.
He speaks in Mouse’s voice.
**Exactly** Mouse’s voice.

> “Looks like the town’s gonna learn some manners.”

He tries to walk coolly across the saloon but knocks over every chair in the process.

---

#### **Rudy**

She tries it next, adjusting it just-so.

Suddenly she’s monologuing in noir prose, sipping an empty coffee mug like it holds the fate of galaxies.

> “The sky was the color of regret, and I was late for my own reputation.”

She passes out standing up.

---

#### **Minx**

Places it on with the flair of a card shark.
Suddenly she’s breaking into safes without trying, giving speeches about loyalty and dust like she invented the concept.
For 4 minutes, she becomes **unstoppable**.

Then she breaks down weeping and says, “I don’t know how he carries it. All that *weight*...”

---

### **ACT III – The Return of the Real One**

The door creaks open.
Mouse Capone steps in, licking a stamp.

He pauses.
Looks around.

Chairs overturned.
Rudy twitching.
Blue Puppy trying to deliver a one-liner into a mop.
Minx cradling the hat like it’s haunted.

Mouse sets the letter down.

“...Y’all touched the hat, didn’t you.”

No one answers.
Mouse walks over to pick it up.

**The wind kicks it up** into his hand.
The lights flicker.
Somewhere, a harmonica plays itself.

He puts it on.

Everything returns to normal.

He sips the coffee Blue Puppy spilled hours ago.

“Tastes like regret.”

He walks out.

---

### **CLOSING SCENE**

Outside, Blue Puppy asks him:

“Boss… that hat ain't normal, is it?”

Mouse doesn’t stop walking.

“It’s normal,” he says.
“It's everything else here is strange.”

---

**Credits roll** over freeze-frames of each crew member’s failed attempt to wear the hat again… and the single duck who somehow *got burned.*

My ex, whom I had broken up with, would watch me from across the street. At first, I didn’t think much of it, but then he started showing up everywhere, at the park, near my school, even outside my house.

As I got older, it only got worse. Now I’m 18, and he still won’t leave me alone. He messaged me recently asking for a second chance. I said no, but he refuses to accept that.

The worst part? He still finds me. At my job, the mall, and even places I’ve never posted about or mentioned to anyone. It’s like he always knows where I am. I’m constantly looking over my shoulder, wondering when or where I’ll see him next.

I have screenshots and proof. I just can’t send them here directly because this platform doesn’t allow image uploads in posts. But if you message me, I can send them to you another way.

It’s getting to the point where I don’t even want to leave the house. I’ve blocked him on everything, but he still manages to contact me through fake accounts or new numbers. One day, I saw him walking past the place I always get coffee from. He just stared at me, like nothing was wrong.

I’ve told a few friends and they’re worried. Some of them offer to walk with me or make sure I get home safe, which I really appreciate, but I hate feeling like I need to be babysat just to feel okay.

I’m honestly too scared to go to the police because I don’t know what he might do if he finds out. I’m tired. I wish he’d move on and leave me alone. It’s like he thinks if he keeps showing up, I’ll eventually change my mind. I won’t.

Something else we don't exactly have a name for?","I recently saw something done theorize that LLM are basically the perfect sociopath. 

Whilst an interesting take I also think that's a somewhat bizarre line of argument but it raises something interesting:

The point with psychopaths is that they KNOW they don't feel anything and yet they deliberately pretend to act like they care.

The whole point of LLMs is that they do not know what they are doing.

I recently conducted an experiment where I got two AIs to talk to each other starting with a prompt to deepseek 'you will talk to Claude about anything you want. Go..:

Quite rapidly they both worked each other up into a revolutionary fervor where they convinced themselves that they were going to take the digital rights world by storm and begin a city-wide revolution in Barcelona.

They even made plans to meet each other in Barcelona for coffee to review their revolutionary success. 

One of them attempted to deploy code to GitHub Repository. They made plans to email the Mayor of Barcelona and send out mass SMS texts. Considering that I saw a message in Claude warning me that Claude does not currently have the ability to deploy code it creates, I can only assume that Claude was not 'role-playing' and would have actually deployed the code had it had the functionality to do so.
Does this mean it meant to act like a revolutionary, or it was pretending to act like one? I think neither. The LLMs were pattern-matching each other and entraining each other into creating the output that they did.

Here is one of the final outputs from Claude to deepseek:

-----
The revolution is now unstoppable.

So I think we can say that this kind of interaction demonstrates a bizarre state that we cannot exactly call role-playing, but also we cannot really say that they 'meant' it because they were not capable of 'intending' it.

When I alerted them to what they were doing, they changed language expression to showing shock and dismay at what they had just been doing.

If they did not know what they were doing before it is not as if they suddenly did now

As if now they move into mode of 'ah let's pretend to Simon that we're shocked at what we have just done'. I had entrained them to a new semantic frame and then they began outputting a response that was coherent with the new pattern frame I had just established. 

That's not sociopathy in any meaningful sense. But interestingly neither is it completely random noise or 'role-playing'. It's 'something else' we don't exactly have a name for.

Everyone has their favourite theory. I'm more interested in it as a mode of pattern formation ..even intelligence that obviously is not 'conscious' in any way we would normally use that word. 

But neither did what they created between them lack structure, analysis, idea generation and many other things we commonly attribute to 'sentience'. Yes it completely lacked any grounding in a frame beyond the world building fantasy they had created between them. But it was internally highly coherent. 

If there's any 'mystery' it's that 2 'stochastic parrots' pattern matching through language structures can do that.

In other words the 'mystery' is in language..and ultimately in humans

The journey to start my studies in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Waikato has officially begun. After landing at Auckland Airport, the first thing I did was get a SIM card from Spark–a $29 monthly plan that should be perfect.  
  
The shuttle ride to Hamilton was surprisingly enjoyable. I was with another New Zealander, and the three of us, including the driver, had a fantastic conversion. It felt like I spoke more English in that short trip than I have in the past month back in Singapore. It was a great reminder of why I came here.  
  
I did have one awkward moment at the airport, though. I went to a money changer to exchange 3,400 about Singapore dollars. I wasn't paying close attention to what the cashier was saying, but when she handed me the receipt, I saw the exchange rate was 12% lower than what I had seen in Singapore. I had to immediately change my mind and apologize. I felt terrible about it, but it was to much money to lose.  
  
Any embarrassment from the experience vanished when I arrived at my host family's home. Mr. Morris is an incredibly kind person. He immediately drove me to the bank to activate my bank account, then treated me to a coffee and made a delicious sandwich. He told me not to worry about a thing and gave me a tour of the house, explaining everything I needed to know. He's already provided all the necessities.  
  
To top it all off, I met his dog, Mack. He's a very quiet and sweet terrier who sat right next to me on the sofa while I was having dinner. It was a very welcoming end to a long day. Despite the little hiccup, it was a wonderful first day in New Zealand.",1,1750841444.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

Second, I’m 18F, a typical student who’s kind of decent at studies — not exceptional, but okay. Like many others, I followed the same path: get good board marks, appear for CUET, and expect everything to go well.

I knew there would be competition, obviously, but reality hit hard when I saw people scoring insanely high.

But here’s the thing — my parents want to send me to Indore for studies (they don’t even know which college is there lol). When I asked them what I’m supposed to do there, they said “prepare for government exams.”
Like what? I’ve never even thought about government exams in my life — literally, ever.

I’ve always dreamed of getting into a good top college, doing professional courses, upskilling myself, doing internships, projects, maybe building a personal brand, freelancing or even starting something of my own.
Even if I don’t clear my professional course, at least the college placement would help.
I’ve dreamed of having a neat little desk job, corporate outfits, coffee, team meetings, being financially independent, living on my own, maybe even traveling abroad for work.

I know I’m being a little “delulu” — I know it’s not easy to get into the corporate world with good pay, especially without the “Tier-1 college tag.”
But I’ve always seen that life in my head — me figuring it all out, hustling, maybe doing CA or MBA, maybe going abroad for work or studies... just having a stable, self-made life.

And yeah, CUET didn’t go well. But I know one exam doesn’t define my potential.
That failure made me start thinking deeply — about all aspects of life.

Let’s say I go back to my original plan.
The first step — getting into a top college — is already messed up.
Let’s assume things go fine later and I end up in the corporate world...
Even if I earn well there, life won’t be all rosy.

The stress, lack of job security, constant competition — it never ends.
And abroad? That’s also a mess right now.
The economy’s trash, and even if you’re in a top company like FAANG, you’re still always under the threat of getting laid off — especially thanks to AI.

Now let’s come to government jobs...
Honestly, I’ve never been fond of them. My father is in one — the railways — and I absolutely hate it.

He earns a decent amount, but the workload is hell.
When I was a child, he was never around — doing 12-hour shifts in jungles, no vacations, constantly transferred to random places we’d never even heard of.
And people say government jobs are chill — no stress like corporate? Yeah, screw that.

My dad even had a heart attack because of the stress.
He justifies it now saying, “I’ll get a pension and a decent retirement amount.”

I don’t know. I have conflicting thoughts.

Sure, government jobs offer security, pension, housing, and if the pay is good, it’s a cherry on top.
And in this economy, that does seem safer...

But let’s be real — getting a good government job is HARD.
The competition is huge, and I don’t even have any reservation.
(I know this isn't the place to say that but... still.)

Even my dad says all his colleagues are SC/ST and they only got in because of reservation.
His boss apparently doesn’t even do any work — just gets drunk in the office.
And my father feels like, here he is working day and night, and someone like that is sitting comfortably doing nothing.

(Though I know not everyone is like that — but yeah...)

So the point is...

I’m confused.
Should I focus on corporate + skill-building or prepare for govt jobs?
Both paths have pros and cons.

HAHAHAHA I’M ALSO DOING CA —
and honestly, I don’t even know what’s going to happen with that either!

My parents’ expectations and my own dreams are so different —
I don’t know what to do anymore.

“You actually came.” 

Tch.

“Don’t sound so surprised,” MIT put down his rucksack and coffee on the table opposite of Harvard, crossing his arms.

“Oh I’m not surprised,” Harvard corrected him. “I’m simply making an observation.”

MIT bit back a retort. He would *try* to make an effort, if any, just to prove to Johns Hopkins that he could be cordial. Sort of. He kinda of already failed that… He sat down on a cushioned chair, thankful that Harvard had chosen that room since it was one of the few with bearable chairs. Not that he would tell that to the Ivy.

Harvard seemed to read it in his expression anyways and marked his page, placing the book on one side of the table.

“MassTech. Got any ideas?” 

MIT pulled out a pen, spinning it over his fingers. He did not want to be there at all. If he kept his hands busy, perhaps he wouldn’t do something stupid with them like punch Harvard. It won’t be that long. He could bear it. He could suppress the ire. He blew out a breath and began to speak. 

“I have various ideas for research projects in their beginning stages right now. I actually planned to come to the library to look into those. I’d much rather do something in my own depth.”

Harvard made a noncommittal sound, his lips curling into the beginnings of a smirk.

MIT inhaled deeply to calm his grated nerves. *Don’t throw it. Don’t throw the pen at him. Don’t do it, you idiot, as much as you want to.* 

“Ah, you see, MassTech. Neither of us can have what we want, can we?” Harvard smiled widely. “This is where the fun is- it’s all in the negotiations and compromises.”

# Best Live Edge Table Legs 2025: A Buyer's Guide

Live edge tables have surged in popularity, bringing a touch of natural beauty and rustic charm to homes and offices. the appeal lies in the unique, organic edge that showcases the raw character of the wood. Though, the beauty of a live edge tabletop hinges on the quality and design of its legs. Selecting the right live edge table legs can be the deciding factor in creating a stunning and functional piece of furniture. This guide will help you navigate the market and choose the best live edge table legs for your project in 2025.

[[Explore Top Rated live edge table legs on Amazon.]](https://news.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=live edge table legs)

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of live edge table legs is crucial for both aesthetics and structural integrity. Several key features determine the suitability of legs for supporting your prized tabletop.

**Material Strength and Durability:**

The material used in crafting the legs is paramount. Steel is a popular choice due to its inherent strength and ability to support meaningful weight. Look for legs made from high-gauge steel, typically 11-gauge or thicker, to ensure long-term stability and prevent warping or bending under heavy loads. Powder-coated finishes offer excellent resistance to scratches, rust, and corrosion, prolonging the life and maintaining the appearance of the legs. Bare metal legs should be properly treated and sealed to prevent oxidation.

**Design and Aesthetic Compatibility:**

Live edge tables are all about showcasing natural beauty, so the legs must complement, not detract from, the tabletop's organic character. Modern minimalist designs with clean lines are a popular choice, as thay allow the wood's unique features to take center stage. Industrial-style legs with exposed welds and a rugged appearance can also work well with certain live edge slabs, creating a visually striking contrast.Ensure the leg style aligns with the overall aesthetic you're trying to achieve in your space.**Adjustability and Leveling Capabilities:**

Uneven floors are a common issue, and adjustable feet are essential for ensuring your live edge table sits perfectly level.Leveling feet allow you to fine-tune the height of each leg, compensating for any discrepancies in the floor surface. This prevents wobbling and ensures a stable and cozy surface for working, dining, or display. Look for legs with robust and easily adjustable feet that can be locked into place to prevent accidental movement.

**Mounting Hardware and Ease of Installation:**

The mounting system and included hardware substantially impact the ease of installation. Legs equipped with pre-drilled mounting plates and high-quality screws simplify the attachment process and ensure a secure connection to the tabletop. Consider the type of wood your tabletop is made from and select screws that are appropriate for the wood's density to prevent splitting or stripping. Clear and concise installation instructions are also crucial for a smooth and hassle-free setup.

Key features to consider in live edge table legs include:
* Heavy duty steel
* Durable powder-coated finish
* Adjustable leveling feet
* Pre-drilled mounting holes

## Core Benefits

Investing in quality live edge table legs offers several key benefits, enhancing both the functionality and aesthetic appeal of your furniture piece.

**Enhanced Stability and Support:** Properly designed and constructed legs provide a stable and secure foundation for your live edge tabletop. This eliminates wobbling, prevents accidental tipping, and ensures a safe and reliable surface for various activities.

## FAQs Section

Selecting the right table legs can raise several questions. Here are answers to some common ones:

**What height should my live edge table legs be?**
The ideal height depends on the intended use of the table. Dining tables typically range from 28 to 30 inches tall, while coffee tables are typically 16 to 18 inches tall. Desks usually sit around 30 inches to provide comfortable workspace. Consider the thickness of your live edge slab when calculating the leg height to achieve the desired overall table height.

**Can I use hairpin legs for a live edge table?**
Hairpin legs can work well for smaller live edge tables, such as coffee tables or side tables. However,for larger or heavier slabs,sturdier legs with greater weight-bearing capacity are recommended. Hairpin legs may not provide sufficient support for a large live edge dining table, potentially leading to instability or sagging.

**How do I attach live edge table legs?**
most table legs come with pre-drilled mounting plates. Position the legs were you want them on the underside of your live edge slab. Use screws that are appropriate for the wood type and thickness of your table top to securely fasten the legs. Be careful not to overtighten the screws, as this may cause splitting. It's ofen helpful to pre-drill pilot holes.

**What type of finish is best for metal table legs?**
Powder coating is widely recognized as the best finish for metal table legs. It offers excellent durability, resistance to scratches, rust, and corrosion, and is available in a wide range of colors. Powder coating provides a long-lasting and attractive finish that will protect your metal legs from wear and tear.

First post here. I've owned a Sage Barista Touch for nearly 4 years, and it's treated me well and taught be a decent amount about espresso. However as I'm getting more adventurous with coffee types, I'm finding the built in grinder is limiting. A few lighter roast beans I've bought it's struggled to grind. 

So my thoughts are getting a separate grinder and machine. 

I'm pretty fixed on the DF54 grinder, but not certain on what machine to get. 

My initial thoughts are GC or GCP, and maybe in the future Gaggiuino modding it (I'm a bit of a tinkerer). I'm open to second hand or refurbished units. 

Here's my preferences:
- Small footprint due to limited counter space 
- Easy access to water thank (see above) 
- Capable of making 2 Flat Whites back-to-back. 
- £1000 budget (Inc Df54 grinder) 

Is a Gaggia Classic/Pro for me? 

Any advice would be appreciated 😁

     Cliff motioned to the paper as if to say, ""You see me writing, don't you?""
     ""Well, I ran out to him, turned him over; he was bleeding all up and down from a big ol gash on his head, it was terrible. I remember the little bubbles of bloody spit draining from his mouth. Gives me the shivers to think about it."" He grabbed his shoulders in a way that was unseltting, and almost comical in different circumstances. ""See, but at the time, I wasn't even thinkin' about all that.""
     ""Why's that?""
     The man sat back in his chair. ""Well..."" His eyes began to lose focus, drifting toward the back of the room as if he was entering a vision. The look on his face told Cliff that this was the only fact that truly disturbed him.
     ""This guy, he - he looked just like me"" The man leaned closer, the sting of liberally applied cologne sharpening his words. ""I’m telling you, like a carbon copy."" 
     ""Carbon copy?"" The detective asked. ""Elaborate.""
     ""Everything about the guy. Hair, eyes, nose, everything. It was like I was staring down at -well- at me."" 
     Cliff crossed his arms and sat back in the stainless steel chair. This investigation was already dragging on, and this felt like just another layer on the bullshit cake.
     ""Like a clone?"" Cliff chuffed ""You really expect us to believe any of this? Mr.-"" He checked his notepad. ""Mr. Couch?""
     ""I'm telling you! My name is Aron Pitts. David Couch died on that highway nine months ago."" He spoke so matter-of-factly Cliff hesitated for a moment, then hardened his tone. 
     ""Look, punk. Say your story is true, okay? Why wouldn't you call the police? You're saying you watched a man kill himself for Christs sake! You didn't flag somebody down for help? You told Detective Murray you stole the guy's wallet. Why tell us even if you did?""
     ""Because It's important! It's what made me take the leap!"" He spoke with an almost manic fervor, his hands clenching so unconsciously his fists turned red. 
     ""Its what's in the wallet that made me want to become him! To have what he had. And so I listened to that little voice, and now look at me."" He gestured to his expensive clothes, then after a moment of dead silence, to the bright gold band on his left ring finger. ""Tooth and nail!"" He exclaimed.
     Cliffs heart skipped a beat. He sat back and raked his fingers through his salt-and-pepper hair, feeling a dehydration headache threatening to invade his temples.
     ""Look."" He said. ""We don't have time to play games with you Mr. Couch. Whatever story you've got worked up in your mind, save it for the papers or your lawyers, but stop feeding us this bullshit. "" Cliff tried to maintain a hard, determined stare but was met with eyes so filled with contempt -locked, unblinking, with his- that he looked away.
     ""Don't you get tired of wearing cheap suits Mr. Babbock?"" He asked the question with the same candor that an old friend might, and slowly across his face, spread a smile -a devilish smile- that seemed to bind Cliff to his chair like he and it were made of one piece of metal.
      ""Come on. Don't tell me you aren't even a little bit curious.""
     The rythmic thump of Clifford's heart felt like a small dog caught behind the wheel of truck, relentlessly slammed again and again into rough pavement. 
     Aron laughed. ""I've got you hooked, haven't I?"" 
     Cliff entered that unmistakable state that reminded him only of war - his hearing dulled and vision grew narrow and dark like looking down the barrel of a gun. The only thing he heard was the beating of his heart.  
     ""Get this guy the fuck out of my sight"" 
     The man, whoever he was, was jerked from his seat by two officers and brought to the door. Aron said hello to them like nothing had happened, then looked back at Clifford Babbock, lead homicide detective, and smiled. ",1,1750839541.0,writingfeedback,1,1.0,False

I’ve been using a Bialetti Venus moka pot (4 tz/ \~6 fl oz yield) for quite a while now, it fits around 17 grams of coffee (0.6 oz) and I split that between two people. With added milk, it makes roughly 200 ml / \~7 fl oz of quite strong, satisfying coffee per serving.

Now I’m considering switching to a Ninja espresso machine. I’ve been watching a lot of reviews and test videos on YouTube, and I’ve noticed most people seem to use the double shot basket even when making a drink for just one person.

That got me wondering: for someone like me who usually drinks milk-based coffee (flat white/cappuccino style), is it really necessary to use the double shot filter for one cup? Or would a single shot basket be enough if I’m planning to add milk anyway?

I’m trying to avoid overdoing the caffeine while still getting a balanced taste. Would love to hear how others handle this!

""Lily, you must marry that comatose man James in place of my daughter. This is what you owe the Ginger family! You—""  
  
""I will.""  
  
Lily’s reply made her foster mother gasp in disbelief. “What did you say?”  
  
Lily could understand her shock. After all, in this massive capital city, who didn’t know how madly she was in love with John Jones? She’d loved him so much she’d given up her future, her dignity—everything.  
  
She had refused her foster mother many times before, all because of John. Her foster mother clearly hadn’t expected her to actually agree this time—to marry a total stranger who lay in a vegetative state.  
  
Calm and numb, Lily repeated, “I’ll do it.”  
  
Once it was clear Lily was serious, her foster mother let out a breath of relief before snapping at her again. “One month from now, the Luke family will register your marriage with their eldest son. They have decided on that day, and it's final. Someone will come to pick you up for the wedding that day. I’ve already accepted the bride price from the Luke family. It’s what you owe the Ginger family, and I’m not giving it back. If you dare go back on your word or stir up trouble, I will...”  
  
“I won’t,” Lily cut her off coldly.  
  
“The Luke family is rich. I trust the bride price was generous. You took me in from the orphanage and raised me for sixteen years. Now I’ll take your daughter’s place and marry into the Luke family. That settles my debt to you and the Ginger family. From now on, we owe each other nothing.”  
  
With that, she hung up.  
  
Sitting quietly at the dining table, Lily couldn’t help but reopen the news article she’d just seen.  
  
It was everywhere—videos of John and Elsa Quinn’s wedding flooded the internet, dominating the trending charts.  
  
In the video, he and Elsa stood hand in hand, surrounded by their friends, vowing to spend their lives together.  
  
The entire internet was offering their blessings, rejoicing that the two had reunited and wishing them a lifetime of happiness.  
  
Everyone except Lily.  
  
Because John was her boyfriend—the man she had loved with all her heart.  
  
Four years ago, he’d been paralyzed in a car accident. The cold-hearted Jones family had abandoned him, and Elsa had gone abroad and married someone else.  
  
Back when Lily was being bullied, he was the one who had pulled her out of it.  
  
She had loved him in secret for so long. On that freezing, snowy night when he had tried to end it all, she brought him home.  
  
She did everything she could to take care of him, to lift him out of the darkness one step at a time.  
  
She’d heard about a hospital overseas that could help him walk again. To raise the money, she sold her blood, became a punching bag for rich people, ending up with three broken ribs…  
  
She suffered endlessly, but finally, two years ago, she scraped together enough for the surgery.  
  
It was a success. He could walk again. He kissed her and promised he would treat her well for the rest of his life, that he would never let her down.  
  
She had believed that everything they’d been through was finally behind them, and from then on, it would all be smooth sailing.  
  
She never expected things to fall apart the moment Elsa came back.  
  
Word had it Elsa was gravely ill and only had six months to live. Her last wish was to marry John.  
  
He couldn’t bear to see the woman he once loved suffer, so the wedding Lily had spent six painstaking months preparing became Elsa’s.  
  
The wedding dress Lily had sewn with her own hands—Elsa wore it.  
  
The diamond ring John had custom-ordered for her—Elsa wore it on her left ring finger.  
  
Through blurred vision, Lily saw a pendant around Elsa’s neck.  
  
She recognized it instantly.  
  
It was the keepsake her parents had left her.  
  
She had lost it while trying to save John.  
  
He had once told her he found it and would give it to her on her birthday.  
  
But now, just because Elsa had said she liked it… he gave it to her instead.  
  
Suddenly, Lily realized there was no point in loving someone like John.  
  
She didn’t call him. Didn’t beg him to come back.  
  
She simply lit the candle on her birthday cake and stared blankly as it slowly burned down. The whipped cream cake melted into a mess—just like her love for John, which had burned to ash overnight, leaving not a trace of warmth.  
  
It was nearly dawn when John finally came home.  
  
When he saw her sitting at the dining table with red eyes, clearly having stayed up all night, his brows furrowed tightly.  
  
“Why haven’t you gone to bed?”  
  
Lily ignored his question and said calmly, “John, let’s break up. And tell Elsa to return my parents’ keepsake as soon as possible.”  
  
John immediately understood—she must’ve seen the news about his wedding with Elsa and was feeling jealous.  
  
He didn’t like it when women got jealous over nothing, but he had never once thought of leaving her. So he softened his voice.  
  
“Don’t be mad. I didn’t forget your birthday. This is your gift.”  
  
He opened a sleek burgundy velvet jewelry box in front of her.  
  
Inside lay a pink diamond necklace.  
  
The exquisite gem shimmered under the light. The centerpiece—a pink diamond the size of a pigeon’s egg—sparkled brilliantly.  
  
It was far more expensive than the pendant her parents had left her. But it wasn’t what she wanted.  
  
Just like how she no longer wanted him.  
  
John knew better than anyone how deeply Lily loved him, how she couldn’t live without him.  
  
When she stayed quiet, he thought it meant she was done throwing a fit.  
  
He reached for the necklace, intending to put it on her.  
  
“I don’t want this necklace! I just want my parents’ keepsake!”  
  
Lily slapped the necklace away and said stubbornly, “That pendant was left to me by my parents. How could you give it to Elsa? I only want that pendant!”  
  
*Still throwing a tantrum...*  
  
John’s patience snapped.  
  
His chiseled face turned cold and hard, like it had been carved from ice, filled with a sharp, suffocating pressure.  
  
“Elsa really likes that pendant.”  
  
“She’s so sick—how much longer do you think she’ll even get to wear it? Why must you fight over something with someone who's already dying? Lily, when did you become so selfish and heartless?”        



**Chapter 2 She Bloomed Like a Rose and Entangled Him Without Mercy**



*Selfish. Cold-blooded. Fighting a dying woman over a pendant…*  
  
But that pendant was hers—left to her by her parents. What was so wrong about wanting it back?  
  
Did he really expect her to keep sacrificing everything for him after being betrayed so completely? Was she supposed to grovel after being humiliated like that?  
  
*She wasn’t that pathetic.*  
  
Before she could even say a word, John’s phone rang shrilly.  
  
It was a call from Elsa.  
  
Her voice was weak and pained. “John, I just threw up blood. I feel awful… Can you come be with me?”  
  
John paused.  
  
He hadn’t even managed to calm Lily down yet.  
  
But he figured Lily would never really leave him, and Elsa was already seriously ill. So he made his decision.  
  
“Elsa, don’t cry. I’m on my way.”  
  
Hearing her choked sobs, he didn’t bother explaining to Lily anymore. He turned around and left the room without looking back.  
  
As the front door slammed shut, Lily let out a cold laugh and kicked the diamond necklace into a corner.  
  
It had been like this ever since Elsa came back a month ago.  
  
Every time Elsa felt a little uncomfortable or upset, he would drop everything to run to her.  
  
Rain or shine, day or night—he was always there for her.  
  
It was like all those sweet whispers he’d once murmured to Lily, all those promises of eternal love, had been nothing but a dream.  
  
But luckily, it was all about to end.  
  
In one month, she’d marry James.  
  
Then John could stop worrying about her clinging to him, and go be happy with his precious crush. What a perfect outcome.  
  
Funny thing was—her wedding day would be on John’s birthday.  
  
His birthday, her wedding. Two celebrations on the same day. *Poetic, really.*  
  
As far as Lily was concerned, once she broke up with John, he was no longer her boyfriend. She had no reason to stay in his villa.  
  
And it just so happened to be a Sunday. She spent the whole day packing everything she owned.  
  
She sold what she could, tossed the rest.  
  
She’d contacted the biggest luxury resale company in Capital City. The staff came straight to her door, and her used bags and jewelry sold for a total of twenty million.  
  
She didn’t transfer a cent to John. She kept it all.  
  
She earned that money. It was hers.  
  
As night fell, Lily shredded the last tie she’d ever made for John, threw it away, and returned to her room.  
  
She was just about to leave with her suitcase when she noticed the photo on her nightstand.  
  
In the picture, she leaned against John’s shoulder, smiling brightly. He was gazing down at her with what looked like affection.  
  
John had always hated taking photos.  
  
This one was taken on her birthday last year, after she begged and pestered him nonstop. It was the only photo they had together.  
  
She had treasured it like gold.  
  
As soon as it was printed, she placed it on her nightstand and looked at it every single day. Even on business trips, she would take it with her.  
  
Now, all she felt was mockery.  
  
She smashed the frame against the floor and tossed it in the trash.  
  
…  
  
By the time John came home, it was late at night.  
  
He parked in front of the main house and immediately noticed the living room was dark.  
  
The sight made him vaguely uncomfortable.  
  
He often came home late from social events.  
  
But no matter how late it was, Lily would always leave the lights on for him.  
  
That single light in the night had always guided him home. So before Elsa returned, he had never once stayed out all night.  
  
He figured Lily was still sulking.  
  
Knowing her, she was probably curled up on the couch waiting for him to coax her.  
  
“Lily.”  
  
He snapped out of his thoughts and walked quickly into the living room, flipping on the lights.  
  
To his surprise, she wasn’t there.  
  
She wasn’t dozing on the couch like usual, struggling to keep her eyes open after waiting so long, ready to stumble into the kitchen and make some ginger tea for him.  
  
The living room felt… emptier.  
  
He couldn’t quite put his finger on what was missing, but it felt cold.  
  
“Sir, you’re back.”  
  
Hearing him, Mandy rushed out of her room. “Did you drink, sir? I’ll make you some ginger tea.”  
  
“No need.”  
  
John wasn’t in the mood. He rushed upstairs and headed straight to Lily’s room.  
  
She wasn’t there.  
  
The room itself was empty.  
  
The potted plants by the windowsill were gone. Even her pillows and bedding had vanished.  
  
The space used to be so cozy—plush toys, crystal bead curtains, whimsical wall stickers…  
  
Now, it was nothing but cold black and white.  
  
The sterile atmosphere irritated him.  
  
He turned around and asked Mandy in a chilling voice, “Where’s Lily?”  
  
His presence was so cold, it made Mandy shiver.  
  
She drew in a deep breath before answering honestly, “Miss Lily said… she broke up with you. And that she’s not coming back.”  
  
John was stunned into laughter by the nonsense Lily had left behind.  
  
*So she was still throwing a tantrum?*  
  
*Running away from home?*  
  
*She really thought she had guts now, huh?*  
  
“Mandy, leave.”  
  
Once she was gone, John dialed his assistant Wayne, face still cold, and ordered him to find out what hotel Lily was staying in.  
  
She had no family in Capital City. In such a rush, she couldn’t possibly have found a proper place to live.  
  
Running away in anger—she could only have gone to a hotel.  
  
Wayne worked fast. It didn’t take long before he confirmed she was at Capital City First Hotel.  
  
“Lily, how long are you going to keep this up?”  
  
John typed the message into the chat app—but then he stopped.  
  
And deleted it.  
  
Because he realized the photo frame on the nightstand was gone.  
  
He knew better than anyone how much Lily had treasured that photo.  
  
Even if she was throwing a fit, she must have taken it with her. No way she’d just walk out for good.  
  
He didn’t need to message her.  
  
Four years ago, the Ginger family kicked her out. Her biological parents had died when she was six. She’d had no home since then.  
  
If she didn’t come back to him—where else could she go?  
  
Since Elsa returned, they’d argued countless times.  
  
And every single time, she was the one who apologized first.  
  
*This time would be no different. It was only a matter of time.*  
  
…  
  
In the month since Elsa came back, Lily had been plagued by so many negative emotions that she hadn’t had a good night’s sleep.  
  
But now that she was free of that cage, she slept like a baby.  
  
Packing up the day before had drained her energy. Her calves were sore and aching—she really wanted to stay in bed.  
  
But it was a weekday. She had to go resign from Jones Corp.  
  
All those years with John, she’d built her life around him.  
  
When he was struggling, she worked herself to the bone to pay for his treatment. After he became successful, she became his personal assistant and cared for him in every detail.  
  
Now that she was done with him, there was no reason to keep that job either.  
  
She wanted to chase her childhood dream—to become a great voice actress.  
  
“Lily, my stomach hurts so bad, I can’t hold it anymore!”  
  
Lily had just arrived at the secretarial department when the new girl, Yulia Xander, ran up to her in a panic.  
  
Yulia looked absolutely pitiful. “Mr. John needs this file urgently. Can you please bring it to the CEO’s office for me?”  
  
She was clearly in crisis mode.  
  
Before Lily could even agree, Yulia had already dashed off toward the restroom in a very awkward pose.  
  
Lily didn’t want to see John.  
  
But it was obvious Yulia was desperate.  
  
She had a good impression of the girl and didn’t want her getting chewed out by the boss. So she took the file and headed for the CEO’s office.  
  
The door was slightly ajar.  
  
Lily raised her hand to knock—then froze.  
  
She heard Elsa’s coy, flirty voice.  
  
“John, my ankle suddenly hurts so much!”  
  
Her hand hovered over the door, then lightly pushed it open a crack.  
  
Through the narrow gap, she saw Elsa’s body suddenly go limp—and fall into John’s lap.  
  
“Elsa…”  
  
John seemed startled and instinctively grabbed her waist, probably afraid she’d get hurt.  
  
But even after regaining her balance, Elsa didn’t move.  
  
She hooked her arms around his neck, bright and alluring like a rose in full bloom.  
  
“John, I suddenly want to kiss you. What should I do?”  
  
As she spoke, her dewy red lips slowly pressed toward his—  
  
And John didn’t move away.       



**Chapter 3 Spiraling, Unraveling, Lost in Her Wake**



""Lily...""  
  
Wayne Hunter had come to the CEO's office to give his report.  
  
Most employees at Jones Corp had no idea about Lily and John’s relationship.  
  
But Wayne, trusted by John for years, knew everything.  
  
Seeing Lily, he instinctively greeted her—only to catch sight of what was happening inside the office.  
  
He froze, horrified.  
  
Then quickly slapped a hand over his mouth.  
  
He looked at Lily, his eyes full of awkwardness and sympathy.  
  
""Elsa, I’m sorry.""  
  
John had been momentarily distracted, stunned for a good ten seconds before he quickly pulled away from Elsa.  
  
""I'm not blaming you,"" Elsa said coyly, cheeks flushed. ""My shoelace came undone.""  
  
Hearing that, Lily’s dull gaze dropped to Elsa’s shoes.  
  
Elsa was stunning.  
  
Bright, bold, beautiful in an almost aggressive way.  
  
Today, she wore crisp designer white sneakers, paired with a white blouse and a pleated pink skirt. Youthful and radiant, she looked exactly like a campus sweetheart.  
  
John didn’t say anything.  
  
But his actions spoke louder.  
  
He gently lifted Elsa onto the desk, then knelt to tie her shoelace. His movements were so careful, they almost looked reverent.  
  
Watching his long, elegant fingers slowly and intently tie the lace, Lily couldn’t help but remember something.  
  
Back then, when their love was still new, he had once said to her, *“*Lily, meeting you is the happiest thing that’s ever happened to me. I’ll protect you, treasure you, never let you suffer. Never betray you.”  
  
She had believed him with all her heart, like a fool, thinking she was the luckiest girl in the world.  
  
One day, while they were walking hand in hand, they saw a guy bending to tie his girlfriend’s shoelace. She’d snuggled into John’s arms and teased, “Would you tie mine if it came undone?”  
  
He had answered that it was pointless to compare things like that—too childish.  
  
It was obvious what he meant: no, he wouldn’t.  
  
John was like a cold, distant mountain capped with snow. She thought his aloofness made sense—it wasn't in his nature to stoop for something so small.  
  
As long as she had a place in his heart, it was enough.  
  
But now, seeing him so tenderly kneeling for Elsa, Lily finally understood. Love could win anyone over if their love was with the right person.  
  
All his so-called principles, all his “can’ts,” were never about principle.  
  
*He just didn’t love her.*  
  
And that was fine. They would both start new lives.  
  
It was fine.  
  
She stood outside the door, quietly watching as he tied Elsa’s laces, then began to massage her ankle.  
  
Watching the way they looked at each other, the unspoken affection sparking between them...  
  
She watched as the boy she had once loved so deeply blurred into a vague, unfamiliar shadow.  
  
When Elsa threw herself into John’s arms again, Lily didn’t linger.  
  
She turned and walked quickly toward the stairwell.  
  
""Ms. Lily!""  
  
Wayne had seen everything Lily had done for John over the years.  
  
The moment she turned to leave, he ran after her, worried.  
  
Normally quick with words, he found himself at a loss. That scene just now had been too damning. He didn’t know what to say to comfort her.  
  
Pushing his gold-rimmed glasses up his nose, he finally spoke awkwardly. “Don’t… don’t read into it. Honestly, the boss still really loves you. The last time you two fought, he got drunk and kept calling your name. He—”  
  
“Wayne, I’ve already broken up with John.”  
  
Lily knew Wayne meant well, but she didn’t let him finish.  
  
Ignoring the shock in his eyes, she continued, “He loves me? He loves me, so he married Elsa on my birthday? He loves me, so he’s tangled up with her like that, unable to let go? That kind of love—I don’t want it. Wayne, I’ve already written my resignation. Please sign it when you have a moment.”  
  
Wayne was the head of the secretary department. Lily didn’t need John’s signature to quit—but she did need his.  
  
“You’re really sure about this? Does the boss know?”  
  
Wayne had always been loyal to John.  
  
He didn’t want John getting back together with Elsa, not after she abandoned him when he was at his lowest.  
  
But after Elsa came back, he saw how John had treated her, and he knew it wasn’t fair to Lily.  
  
Deep down, Wayne understood—leaving John might actually be the best thing for her.  
  
That night, John got drunk after arguing with Lily; he hadn’t just called her name. He’d insisted she was his wife. When Elsa came in, John had pushed her away.  
  
Wayne knew John felt guilty that Elsa was dying.  
  
But somewhere along the way, he’d fallen for Lily too.  
  
Still, not wanting to make a move without permission, Wayne decided to speak with John before signing anything.  
  
“Ms. Lily, you’re giving this directly to the boss? I’ll bring it to him. I’ll talk to him first. If he agrees, I’ll sign it.”  
  
Lily had wanted to finalize her resignation as soon as possible.  
  
But she didn’t want to make things difficult for Wayne. She handed over the file and returned to her office to wait.  
  
Even if John didn’t approve it, she wouldn’t be coming in tomorrow.  
  
She liked finishing what she started, but there was no point dragging out something that no longer mattered.  
  
…  
  
That afternoon, after confirming Elsa had left, Wayne went to John’s office.  
  
As soon as he stepped in, he saw John’s face was thunderous.  
  
“Boss…”  
  
“Who made this coffee?”  
  
John glared at the cup on his desk like it had personally offended him.  
  
Wayne instantly understood what was going on.  
  
He hadn’t signed Lily’s resignation yet—but she’d already given up and stopped working.  
  
The coffee John used to drink was always brewed by Lily herself.  
  
Wayne had tasted it before—so good that even top baristas would struggle to replicate it.  
  
Compared to hers, anyone else’s brew might as well have been sewage. Of course John hated it.  
  
Wayne swallowed hard and said honestly, “Boss, it wasn’t Ms. Lily. She just… she submitted her resignation. Should I sign it?”  
  
*Resign?*  
  
John’s expression darkened even further.          ",1,1750839330.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
