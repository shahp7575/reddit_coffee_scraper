Makes you gag a little at the end usually, understandable. Well, there is a lovely unemployed gentleman in my building who begins his day no later than 7:30 AM right in front of the building where he sits and smokes weed and cigarettes all day long. Smoke if you want, I do. That’s not the issue. The issue is that he scream coughs so loud you can literally hear him from a block away. His coughing fits last anywhere from 10 to 30 seconds which doesn’t sound like a lot until you’re listening to them at a rate of about 10 fits per hour, and he does sit out there for hours at a time sometimes. All he does is go back-and-forth from his apartment to the front of the building smoking all day long. I only have until 7:30 AM at the latest to enjoy the sound of the birds and my coffee. I complained to the building manager after about two years of listening to it every day and he’s chilled out slightly since then. He is not embarrassed or ashamed. He doesn’t care if it annoys people. It’s so disgusting to listen to. I don’t want to have to turn on a fan and my TV and make a bunch of noise in my apartment at 8 AM to drown out the sound of somebody outside, downstairs and across the street who is literally gagging themselves and spitting up so loud that I can damn hear the fucking spit leave his mouth. WTF?!?! Currently working on a Spotify playlist composed entirely of the many recordings I have of him and I’m just going to set up my echo one day outside of my door and let ‘er rip on full volume while he’s out there.

1igsnw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1igsnw9/aita_for_picking_a_girl_up_for_a_date_and_her/,AITA for picking a girl up for a date and her bailing?,"I've been wracking my brain to think if I did something or said something that made this girl uncomfortable or scare her off after she had her friends rescue her from a coffee date with me. Here's what happened: 

  
I (32M) matched with a girl (21F) on tinder and we really hit it off. I know some people will already feel a type of way because of an age gap but my parents are ten years apart and have been married for 40 years so it's not really something that is much of a factor for me or even something I think about. Some additional context that might be relevant here is that I'm also clearly, explicitly a Dom (seeking a D/s dynamic) on my Tinder profile and a prominent member in my community (professor) and due to the stigma many people have related to kink I don't have my face posted on my profile. Just a few photos of me in different work attire and outfits with my face either cropped out or blurred. So we match, have a few wonderful conversations both regarding nsfw topics and sfw topics and we agree to go on a coffee date to get to know each other better. At this point I've sent her a picture of what I fully look like (sfw) and we've even had an hour long phone conversation and I sent her a snap of me playing the piano and singing an Olivia Rodrigo song. So she definitely knows what I look like by now. She's a college student and doesn't have a car so I ask if she'd rather meet me at the coffee shop or have me pick her up and she says she'd like me to come pick her up from her apartment. So a few days go by and it's time for the date. I drive over to her place and this is where I start to sense that the vibes are changing. I come to pick her up and she's in her friends' car with about 2-3 other girls. Not all that weird, I can understand her friends wanting to be safe as she's meeting a guy from a dating app for the first time. She comes over to my car, gets in, we exchange greetings and I plug the coffee shop directions into my phone and we get started. The coffee shop is about 25 minutes away. We get going and we're talking as we're on the way and honestly the conversation seems to be flowing very naturally but I do notice she's not really making much eye contact with me and she's on her phone quite a bit. Maybe she's just a naturally gifted yapper? I don't know. I feel like it's also important to note that we're not really talking about anything that I think would make someone uncomfortable, just things about her studies, her family, etc. Basic stuff. I also didn't make any comments I feel would make her uncomfortable other than initially saying that she looked great/pretty when she got in the car. Maybe that would make her uncomfortable? But I had already told her how attractive I felt she was before that and she had been very receptive to it so I'm not sure how much different that would be than any other interaction we had before then. I didn't attempt to touch her at all except for this one moment right before we parked at the coffee shop where I touched her leg to reassure her that I'm a decent driver after I made an error turning into the wrong parking lot. So we get to the coffee shop and get in line to place our orders and I ask her what she'd like and she just says she wants a water. This is when I start to really get suspicious that something's wrong. Why would she suggest a date to get coffee and then not even get anything? But okay, whatever, maybe she's just not in the mood for caffeine. She does seem very interested in the wifi password though (suspicion growing) and I tell her they probably give it to us once we place an order, which is exactly what happens when I order my London Fog (leaf water > bean water). I get my drink and the wifi login and we go sit down and we chat for about five minutes before she says her roommate is needing her to call her about her grandma (?) and I'm like okay, sure, no problem. So she calls her and starts talking about her english homework (??) and then says something about her grandma being sick. They hang up and then about one minute later like three of her friends come and grab her and say they have to go. This all happens very rushed and she says she'll text me in a few minutes but I obviously never hear from her again. So as I'm typing this out it is becoming increasingly obvious to me that she had decided to opt out of this date basically immediately but like I said earlier, I've been wracking my brain to figure out why or what happened or if I did something wrong. Maybe when she got in the car she wasn't attracted to me? But I had shown her exactly what I look like before this and had even sent a pretty candid video of me singing and playing piano where I didn't have any sort of filter on or focusing on angles to make myself more attractive, it was literally just a two minute video of me singing a song and she gave me feedback that she loved my singing voice and that I was very handsome playing the piano. I'm no supermodel but I'm also not an ugly guy. I've got shoulder length blonde hair with blue eyes, all my teeth, and a great smile. SO I JUST DON""T KNOW WTF HAPPENED HERE. I texted her afterward to ask if I did something that upset her but of course she didn't respond (I'm sure I'm blocked) and she blocked me on snap so I really don't have any way of contacting her. I know this is a long post but I feel like I just needed to process what happened as this whole experienced has left me very confused and honestly pretty humiliated that I made this girl so uncomfortable or she found me so repulsive that she had to get her friends to come rescue her from me. Can y'all think of something in this experience that I did wrong or something that would have made her uncomfortable? Did she just immediately find me unattractive and decide to bail but couldn't bring herself to tell me? I'm genuinely curious and really want to learn some sort of lesson from this experience.

Hi! I’m doing my Masters + PhD in London :) I was raised in both the US and UK over the years so my accent throws people off (I just embrace it as an international school accent). I did my undergrad in the US and then moved back home because I wanted to be closer to family and I miss rainy London. About me: I love to run, swim, hike. My hobbies include, crafting, cooking, reading, movies, and music. My preferred drink is a Matcha Latte but I also really love coffee. My studies and work keep me incredibly busy but ever so often I crave some good deep conversations with a hint (a lot) of sweetness.  I enjoy having academic conversations since I love learning new things. I’m a big fan of staying in and if I could I would probably never leave my house. I’m incredibly open to sharing pictures and eventually talking over voice call and I love questions so feel free to ask me anything:))

Hey,

I’m on a quest—not for a fleeting acquaintance, but for a kindred spirit who’s as passionate about the magic of creative connection as I am. Picture this: two explorers charting the realms of art, ideas, and shared experiences, blending our unique perspectives into something unexpectedly brilliant.

A bit about me: I’m a storyteller, dreamer, and occasional daydreamer who loves to experiment with everything from spontaneous writing sprints and sketching sessions to philosophical deep-dives over a cup of coffee (or tea, if that’s your vibe). I believe creativity thrives when diverse minds collide, and I’m on the lookout for someone who isn’t afraid to color outside the lines.

I’m envisioning a friendship where:
- We challenge each other with creative prompts and collaborate on quirky projects.
- Our conversations meander through topics as varied as the metaphors in our favorite songs to the unsung poetry in everyday life.
- We celebrate both our wins and our artistic missteps, learning from them along the way.

If you’re someone who believes that creativity is a journey best traveled with a partner in art and adventure, or if you’re simply looking to add a dash of creative spark to your day, drop a comment or send me a message. Let’s create something beautiful—whether it’s a quirky blog, a collaborative piece of art, or even just a dynamic dialogue that inspires us both.

Looking forward to hearing from you and exploring where our creative energies might take us!

1igsk5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1igsk5y/blocked_and_hopeless/,Blocked and hopeless,"I think I was just blocked by two friends. These are people who were some of the first I told that I was in a physically abusive marriage. They were very supportive for a while, but my depression and anxiety set in, my kids started having crises, I’m getting divorced, and I think they just got sick of it and started to distance themselves. One of them and I had a few fights but always made up. 
When I started asking what was wrong, they’d say everything was fine and they were still there for me, but they blew me off more and more. This made me more desperate not to lose them and I sent more and longer texts. They ghosted me for 2 months and when I sent (too long) texts trying to explain how hurt I was and why, asking if we could please just meet for a coffee (I haven’t seen them in person in months) they told me to stop contacting them. I even told them that their rejection was making me have unsafe thoughts, and they just threatened to send 911 to my house and then blocked me.

These are people who knew I was in an abusive relationship, who were safety contacts in case I couldn’t safely call the police. How could they totally cut me off? So I sent too many long texts — is that really that awful? Considering everything I was going through and that they kept blowing me off while telling me they weren’t doing so?

Being blocked makes me feel like they think I am dangerous or something. I feel so humiliated, and I feel like they think I made all my trauma up (I didn’t) otherwise how could they be so cruel?

To add, I don’t know if I have BPD, but I have some of the symptoms. I am so totally crushed right now. I cry for hours every day. I know I was annoying, but how can people live with themselves when they do something like this to someone they know is fragile, going through a lot of turmoil, and who they could make feel so much better with a simple coffee date?

I originally posted my personal prep list and there were so many great suggestions in the comments that I am now posting an updated general list, including why I included some items. 

I got pretty good at prepping during the pandemic but depleted my stores and then got lax and didn’t want to focus after the election. That was a mistake. So this past week, I was able to obtain most of my list for about $2k, which was a loan against my tax refund. If you don’t have extra money, even grabbing a few cheap basics (rice, beans, pasta, canned fruit, canned protein: chicken/tuna/spam, frozen fruit and veg) is still worthwhile. Just do what you can, don’t expect to get all this at once, and fight the overwhelm. 

This isn’t a perfect comprehensive list, but after seeing so many posts here along the lines of “what do I do? What should I prep?” I figure I’m doomscrolling anyway, might as well help someone out. I am not an expert, just a stressed out mom that likes taking care of people. 

This list includes what I am stocking at home, what I’m buying because of tariffs, and bug out bags. Deep breaths. Here we go!


 Some tools that are helpful but not necessary:
- a gravity water filter
- a vacuum sealer and rolls/bags
- Mylar bags and oxygen absorbers; a hair straightener for sealing them
- Tape and sharpies for labeling

I have time the 5th and 6th of February from 10am-1pm. 

I imagine something like 1-2 hours of walking / exchanging culture. It's gonna be pretty cold so that should be in mind. 

We could go for coffee, snacks or maybe a beer.
If you dont have any particular things you wanna walk by, i might have some ideas.

I'm a 30yo Male, happily married. I speak English, Danish and maybe 30 Spanish words. I have too many hobbies.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1igsc21,https://www.reddit.com/r/behindthebastards/comments/1igsc21/some_thoughts_from_the_weekend/,Some Thoughts From The Weekend,"I read and enjoyed [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/behindthebastards/comments/1ieur4k/i_dont_think_we_understand_the_magnitude_of_what/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) from this sub a couple of days ago, and spent a lot of time thinking about myself and the roles I inhabit in the world around me. I wrote and posted this to several of my social media channels and communities.

I woke up around 4 a.m. today unable to go back to bed because I'd felt a shift that I'd wondered a bit about on Friday evening. I came to the coffee shop where I work from a couple days a week with a fire in my belly that had been growing since the middle of last week. First, I needed a bagel and an americano because, what the fuck, y'all.

One of the most important things I know about myself is that I'm not an expert in anything, really. I'm a practitioner as a parent and spouse, minister, End of Life care giver. I'm an above average consumer of news - political, general, local, national and international, entertainment and sports, etc. At best, I'm an aggregator and I've found over the years that I've been able to inform others in my circles about happenings both important and benign.

On Friday evening I told my wife before we went to bed that I felt like we'd wake up to a different world on Monday morning, and to me it feels as though that is true. I'm comforted by the fact that a number of journalists and commentators I pay attention to seem to be affirming this.

I told a friend that night that the shutting down of websites and scrubbing of data, which has been done in Donald Trump's previous administration, felt more sweeping. I said that the announced ""search"" for FBI agents who had worked on J6 cases, coupled with the ""buyouts"" offered to civil servants, the stepping down of the top CS at Treasury, and the physical removal of an IG from USDA, felt like the Completed Wet Dream of the ""Saturday Night Massacre"" taken on by Nixon.

As a high schooler in a conservative Central Texas town in a post 9/11 world I developed an interest in WWII - I don't think I'm unique in this. However, I can't help but wonder how so many others like me aren't now seeing so many of the things that happened then and believing, at least on some level, that the same things are being attempted now.

I'm thankful to have read the book, ""The Death of Democracy: Hitler's Rise to Power and the Downfall of the Weimar Republic,"" back in 2020. As I watched J6 unfold before my eyes on twitter, I told a co-worker (a history teacher!) that this felt like Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch - his initial failed attempt to seize power that landed him in prison but garnered him support.

However, I knew then that Donald Trump wouldn't face any meaningful consequences. Just as Hitler was then able to re-make his image and allow those around him to perceive him as someone to be used and controlled before proving himself to be too popular to be shouted down, Donald Trump spent the last four years decrying the ""adults in the room"" that many believed in his first term would hold him back from any meaningful harm so that they could not be counted on the second time around.

I don't consider myself an alarmist or conspiracy theorist. I'm basically and institutions guy. I believe in the Church as a whole, I thing Government should provide goods and services for all beyond what they do now, and that many people who have dedicated their lives to that believe the same things.

As I've started some of these conversations in person or seen them in some of the digital spaces I inhabit online I see and hear many people saying that this, that and the other can't happen because it's not legal to do those things. I firmly belive both by watching what's happening here, reflecting on historical experiences, and what has happened in some places in the world today, that that does not matter to those currently seeking power and control.

The disregard for norms, legality, and the overwhelm is the point. Everyone can't fight every dehumanizing action being taken. So they will continue to take X number of steps knowing that we can only fight Y number of them, and only win Z number. That means that whatever slips through is a win for them and they can move on.

These are not normal circumstances and these are not normal times.

I've long been fond of Dietrich Bonhoeffer and his work as a minister and activist in Nazi Germany. In no way do I believe I am capable of or some kind of Modern Bonhoeffer, don't come for me, that's not what I'm saying. What I am saying is that there are people already doing that kind of work now.

Weeks ago I saw someone here say that the United States doesn't need a Confessing Church like the one Bonhoeffer was integral to in Nazi Germany because we have and have had one. The Black Church. They have long been a prophetic and practical voice and body in this country and many of us would do well to follow their lead in this time.

This is my primary lens through which to consider what's happening in the world right now because I am a Christian. I'll admit that that's primarily because I was born as a white male in Central Texas in 1987 - what other religious/faith tradition might I have found myself in? Born somewhere or sometime else I could have been anything else.

Beyond just identifying as a Christian I am a Pastor. In my faith community I've been entrusted with the Spiritual and Emotional care and shepherding not just of those in my church/faith community/congregation, but the least, the marginalized, the forgotten, the ignored, the attacked and maligned in the world around me both near and far.

So as a White Male Christian Pastor I cannot bypass my responsibility to speak up and speak out against those who take the name of the God I work to reflect and represent. I screw it up. On this feed, I do not speak for my Church or its affiliated networks, my other local business employer, but for myself and what I believe is important",0,1738598322.0,behindthebastards,0,0.5,False

Then I think to my self, “I relay need to spend more time at that church.” So I manage to free up a cart. And turn to enter the store. I hear her say “Chase & crackers, it’s over weight.” She zips it open and starts pulling out things and putting them in a plastic bag.The problem is the bag is filled with Victoria Secrets, Not the cheap Amazon stuff, or low end Frederick’s mail order crap, but the good expensive stuff. Ya I know the difference as I have gifted quite a lot of it over the years, (Much better then flowers.)(See reason 483 “Why Tony is going to Burn in Hell.”).  So OK OK OK OK , I’m Thinking OK OK OK OK,,,, I should Ask her if she needs  a ride to the airport, Or want’s to have a few shots before her flight.(Hay some people are nervous about flying!) Maybe she’s just in to “Cosplay”, Maybe she’s a sex worker flying to meet a client, Oh wait what if she is a nun?, I’ll burn in hell for sure. Then I think, W.T.H. that’s a given anyway.

I don’t know how to date and don’t know how to connect with someone new as being with someone for such a long time I expect a certain level of communication.

I only had one guy actually ask me out (we went on a coffee date). I agreed to a second date, but he wanted to spend a lot of time with me and I got overwhelmed when he kissed me and was too touchy and feely. I essentially got put off and scared off. I told him how I felt as I believe in honesty, we both agreed to take things slow. We played an online game together after that, then he messaged a few times after that but then after a week he no longer messaged (I wasn’t messaging first as I was dealing with a lot of thoughts and feelings). Two weeks no messages, so I just thought he was potentially no longer interested, he started talking to someone else, or it was all just too much too soon it ran its course (so I removed him from steam and discord - he had already unmatched me from Tinder but claimed it was because he had deleted it).

I am someone who needs an emotional connection first, I am struggling to find a guy that can actually communicate or show regular interest.

# About me 

I am on the journey of self-development with you all. Seven months ago, I quit caffeine cold turkey after years of addiction to multiple Venti Starbucks coffees and caffeine-laden pre-workouts. Coffee had become my personality. People used to joke about it. I'd be the last person you'd expect to quit it. I hit rock bottom with it one day after realizing how terrible I felt and the impact it had on my sleep. I was listening to Tony Robbins at the time, and for whatever reason, a thought occurred to me ""I do not need coffee. I have everything I need within."" Now I am fixing up other areas of my life. Communities like this one helped me a lot in my journey and continue to do so. I want to say thank you.

I utilize writing about my vision, vision boarding, thinking about what I do not want, and reflecting on the scarcity of time in order to keep myself focused and achieve goals.

Recently I've been using AI tools to aid my processes.

I decided I could make an app that combines almost all of these and which others may find valuable.

# The App

[https://imgur.com/a/higher-app-Ob3qpCp](https://imgur.com/a/higher-app-Ob3qpCp)

# How It Works:

🏆 Write out your ideal vision. The clearer and more specific your vision, the more powerful your AI-generated boosts will be. 

🚨 Write an anti-vision. What happens if you stay the same? Your future pain becomes your motivation.

⏳ Countdown Timer. A separate screen tracking exactly how much time is left until your goal deadline.

🔥 Hit ""BOOST"" anytime. AI instantly generates a hyper-personalized motivation burst to remind you why you're doing this.

**Story**: I was diagnosed with ADHD 2 years ago, I only really accepted the diagnosis when I took my first dose of methylphenidate and suddenly there was calm and quiet in my head. Until then I felt like I was an impostor. I am starting to see that I strongly identify with autistic traits. I keep re-testing myself on different tests and I consistently score highly on them, I cannot help but slowly accept that the reason why I felt so different my whole life was because I am on the spectrum. This idea is very new to me but undeniable. I am currently waiting to be assessed, but I don't want to make the same mistake I did with my ADHD diagnosis, where I need someone else to validate something I have known my whole life.

  
**Vent:** I am currently in a state. I feel like my life is starting to make sense. I am super angry and sad at the world that how dare they not see that I was clearly a kid struggling. But it is no joke when they say girls get overlooked because they're shy. I was so quiet growing up people literally threw it in my face every chance they had. I never saw a reason to speak. I suspect my parents to also be on the spectrum (would make sense as it is hereditary, although I was a geriatric baby, my mom smoked, had coffee and even alcohol whilst carrying me, thx mom love you) and they closely monitored virtually everything I did. I wasn't allowed to be left handed, sit comfortable, hold a spoon a certain way, I was fed until I was sick, I was too loud, I was too messy, I didn't pay attention, I took up too much space, I had too many questions, I knew too much so I was a know it all - I am still processing how much shame was instilled in me. It is so vulnerable to be a kid to begin with, let alone not even being allowed to be yourself. My parents also struggled with substance abuse since I was a young kid, probably around the age of 3.

My family was super asocial, we never went out, I wasn't socialized with kids, and when I did have kids around me, I was baffled how acting came so natural to them. How do you know how to play? How do you know what to do...like ever? How do you know what you're allowed to say or not to say. How do you know what's appropriate and what won't totally flip people off? Apparently even my walking was weird which I got bullied for because my arms didn't move in unison with my legs (or whatever). Man, do I look back and think it has NOT been easy.

**Help:** I am lost. On the one hand I get, I probably do stand out because if NTs can clock that I am masking, I don't fault them for avoiding me or not proactively nurturing relationships with me. Heaven knows that once the vibes are off with someone, I avoid them like the plague.

I constantly feel like I am a burden for people so I don't really keep in touch unless I have a ""strong reason"" to reach out (whatever that means, I certainly have no definition for it). I realized that I love being alone, my gosh am I at peace when nobody is around, but equally, I want to share my life, I want to send memes to people, to chat and maybe occasionally even leave my lovely nest and get out for something low key. How do I find my people?",1,1738597898.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False
1igs60m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1igs60m/i_kissed_an_ex_friend_while_i_was_in_a/,I kissed an ex friend while I was in a relationship,"Hey guys, I wanted to ask your opinion on a relationship story. 
I have been in a relationship for 5 years with my girlfriend (f23) and I (h24) we met in high school and we are experiencing perfect love. We share our lives and live together. When I was younger and before meeting her, I dated another girl when I was 15-16. she was the first girl I had sex with. At that time, I had feelings for her but she didn't want to hear about it, for her it wasn't serious. I then had two one-year relationships, we remained friends, we went for coffee together but nothing happened. She has never been in a relationship and continues to see other boys. For 5 years I had no contact with her. This weekend, I contacted her again to go out with friends to a bar, without a second thought. The evening was going very well, and we were laughing as if we had seen each other 5 days ago and not 5 years. except that during the evening, and with the alcohol, she admitted to me that she had feelings for me, that she was madly in love with me before I got together with my girlfriend, that I hurt her because we called each other often and even though nothing happened, she told me that I was important to her and that she was mad at me for letting her down. (she even had depression following my absence in her life) following that I was a little upset because I didn't expect it, for me there was nothing more. Except that the next moment she kissed me. Current me didn't want it, but 16 year old me did.  She wanted us to go home together, she was very drunk. I walked him home and told him to go to bed, I also went to bed at home afterwards. Nothing sexual happened. The next day the girl called me back as if nothing had happened to talk to me about everything and nothing, and wants to see me again this weekend. I then blocked his number. I didn't tell my girlfriend anything. I blame myself for contacting the other girl again. I feel like a complete asshole and what the other girl said to me still really disturbed me. What would you do in my place please? ",1,1738597893.0,Advice,2,1.0,False
1igs4za,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1igs4za/there_is_hope_nausea_getting_suddenly_better/,There *IS* hope... nausea getting suddenly better!,"For anyone in the throes of terrible nausea and food aversions (like I've been for the last 4-5 weeks) just wanted to share that I had a really noticeable breakthrough this weekend (I'm about 11.5 weeks now). Things like coffee and eggs, which have sounded beyond repulsive to me, were suddenly appealing again — and even though I can still feel some low-grade nausea intermittently throughout the day, it isn't so overwhelming and distracting that it's affecting my happiness anymore. I feel like the last month has been SO rough and it was hard to see a light at the end of the tunnel, so if you're still struggling, HANG IN THERE!   
  
I'm well aware that this isn't the experience for everyone. For some, it lasts longer. There were days were I honestly forgot what it felt like to be ""me"" and I was really losing hope. I'm fortunate to have never dealt with depression in my life although it runs in my family, and I finally understood what it felt like to be depressed. Hearing stories about people overcoming these symptoms really reassuring for me personally. I think they were honestly the one thing getting me through. So just wanted to offer the same! This is only temporary, and you will get through it, promise!",3,1738597817.0,pregnant,2,1.0,False

Are there any known raspberry pi projects similar to the Naked Portafilter - Smart Espresso Profiler? Basically something that has a connection to a pressure gauge, a scale, and into some sort of display to graph pressure, and weight over time. ideally maybe save brew profiles and import good profiles to mimic. I am not a developer or an extreme coffee nerd to develop any of this from the ground up but i can copy paste code like a champ! with my amazing googling skills some sort of ideal scenario of an MVP would be:

wired Pressure gauge
wired scale
wire raspberry pi zero 2w, maybe raspberry pi 4 or 5
w ink display w/ minimal UI, but enough to see the graphs, any other relevant info
minimal buttons on the display to save profiles, and select profiles to replicate
an additional unicorn wish list would be:

temperature sensors at the bowl
Phone app to communicate w/ RPi
easy loading of software on a MicroSD card
more data logging capabilities to describe coffee, grind size, grinder, water quality, etc
As an alternative, is there anyone w/ better skills than mine to help get this together?

Understanding Teeth Whitening Preparation

Preparing for teeth whitening is more than just showing up for a treatment. The right preparation can help you achieve optimal results and minimize potential discomfort. Here are the critical steps to take before your teeth whitening procedure:

1. Schedule a Dental Check-up

I was thinking of pro cyclists, and how they have crazy genetics that allow them to push to insane levels with lots of training. 

But then I was wondering: Genetics are something you are born with, right? So maybe there are, out there, people with insane genetics, perfect for becoming a pro cyclist, but they've never been on a bike. 

Does this make sense at all? How do you know have insane genetics until you push yourself to the limit? A place where few of us ever venture.

And in the meantime... we can't do everything, but we can all do something. Right now, the absolute most important thing that we each MUST do is contact our Dem senators and demand the following from each of them: 

*1. Deny a Quorum: In most cases if Republicans don't have 51 votes in the chamber, Democrats can walk out and shut down Senate business entirely.*

*2. Block Unanimous Consent: Object to every procedural shortcut, forcing Republicans to take the longest possible route for every step of the confirmation process.*

*3. Max Out Debate Time: Use all 30 hours of debate on Vought to expose Project 2025, Musk's Treasury takeover, and the funding freeze.*

*4. Delay and Disrupt: Force roll-call votes, quorum calls, and procedural delays to slow everything down.*

*5. Blanket Opposition: Democrats cannot continue to vote for Trump's other nominees, helping to install more MAGA loyalists into powerful positions in the federal government while this power grab continues.*

*6. No Business as Usual: This is a constitutional crisis. Democrats must abandon the old rules and fight with everything they have.*

All current Senator [phone numbers are here](https://www.senate.gov/general/resources/pdf/senators_phone_list.pdf). Just add 202-22 in front of the 5 digit number. Call yours, now. And then again tomorrow. 

If you're afraid to call, here's some useful things to know. I used to work in senate constituent services and took calls all day .

\-Your senator is greatly influenced by the opinion of their staffers, so be nice to them.

\-100 people calling and saying the same thing is REALLY powerful. Especially if it ties up the entire day.  Taking the call, entering it into the data system, making notations for your boss, it's a whole process.

\-You don’t need to be an expert—just be clear, polite, and direct. Nobody is going to challenge you over the phone. 

\-Call your senator *from your state*. They prioritize constituents over out-of-state callers. 

\-If phone anxiety is a problem, write a script out or practice out loud before you call. I strongly encourage a phone call over an email- they carry much more weight and are harder to ignore. 

\-Staffers know that you might be nervous when you call. We hear lots of shaky voices. We know it means that you aren't one of our usual callers and that this must be something significant if you are calling even though you are anxious. Let your anxiety be your friend here. 

And now onto the 3 A's: 

\--------

**Appeal: Build connections**

Lean on your social circles—friends, family, and colleagues. Stay connected, stay talking. Widen your community. Arrange more hang-outs and coffee dates. Take an art class. Help your people when they need it, and tell your people when you need it. Fear thrives in isolation.

**Affirm Positive Norms: Reinforce the values you want to see**

Speak up about what your community stands for, whether in person or online. Share stories and examples of positive, collective action in your circles. Challenge fear-based propaganda with stories of shared humanity and community. Don’t just react to the news- create your own & set the agenda by showing what freedom and joy look like.

**Act: Take meaningful steps in your everyday life.**

Call out misinformation and propaganda when you see it- without repeating it. Support organizations and individuals working to counter division and disinformation. Support quality independent journalism. Most indie journalists and outlets have newsletters to which you can subscribe. Organize or participate in discussions, protests, book clubs, rallies, etc.

Remember, authoritarianism succeeds when people feel powerless. Strengthening our connections to each other strengthens our power.

***SOCIAL MEDIA DO’S AND DON’TS***

# DO’s

* **Verify Before Sharing** – Always fact-check news using reputable sources before reposting or reacting. For example, please don’t post about an ICE raid unless you’ve verified it. Remember: the regime wants to be seen as omnipresent to create panic and despair, so don’t do their bidding by sharing something you aren’t sure is true.
* **Amplify Reliable Voices** – Support experts, activists, and marginalized voices combating disinformation.
* **Use Screenshots for Misinformation** – If calling out false information, use screenshots instead of linking directly so you don’t boost engagement for bad actors.
* **Report and Block Bots/Trolls** – Many disinformation accounts are automated or paid operatives. Report and move on instead of engaging.

# DON’Ts

* **Don’t Share Without Reading** – Clickbait headlines are designed to mislead. Always read the full article before posting.
* **Don’t Fall for Rage Bait** – Outrage-driven posts (even if accurate) often serve to exhaust and distract. Stay focused on actionable issues.
* **Don’t Engage with Obvious Trolls** – Their goal is to waste your time and flood the discourse with noise. Starve them of attention.
* **Don’t Assume Screenshots and Pictures are Real** – Bad actors often use fake photos to spread false narratives. Check original sources.
* **Don’t Share Disinformation to “Debunk” It** – This will spread a false narrative further. They know they’re lying - they want to outrage you so that you share *their* narrative to spread it.
* **Don’t Let Social Media Be Your Only Action** – Posting isn’t enough. Get involved in your community, support trustworthy journalism, and take real-world action.",21,1738597289.0,TwoXPreppers,0,1.0,False

1igrxeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1igrxeo/southern_argentinian_patagonia_reconsider_with/,Southern ARGENTINIAN Patagonia: Reconsider with the Current High Prices (February 2025),"First, let me say that Argentina is amazing. In my past 1 1/2 months I (central European male backpacker) had the privilege to meet incredibly helpful and social people enjoy stunning landscapes. I absolutely loved the north, Buenos Aires, Córdoba, and the mountains around Mendoza (Vallecitos) — which, in my opinion, are better than Patagonia. They are less crowded, have breathtaking views, no entrance fees, and cheaper accommodation.

However, my last 11 days in Southern Argentinian Patagonia left me and many others a bit disappointed (or broke ^^) due to high prices for low to mediocre quality. Here's my breakdown of the current situation to help you decide if it’s worth your time and money:

What to Expect (February 2025)

The current exchange rate is approximately 1,000 ARS = 1 USD. Prices have skyrocketed, even though the government stabilized the peso, making travel here expensive for everyone, including foreigners.

Costs to Keep in Mind:

National Park Fees:
.) Fitz Roy: 45,000 ARS/day ($45 USD)

.) Perito Moreno Glacier: 45,000 ARS ($45 USD), plus 50,000 ARS ($50 USD) for the bus


Transportation:
.) Taxi from El Calafate to the airport (15 minutes): 34,000 ARS ($34 USD)

.) Bus from El Calafate to El Chaltén: 40,000 ARS ($40 USD)

.) Flights from major cities: 200,000-500,000 ARS ($200-$500 USD)

.) No Uber or public transport options


Accommodation:
.) El Calafate: A decent hostel costs 25,000 ARS ($25 USD) with breakfast

.) El Chaltén: Expect 35,000-40,000 ARS ($35-$40 USD) without breakfast, often with poor conditions (dirty, no hot water)


Dining Out:
.) A simple meal (like a burger or pizza) with drinks: 40,000 ARS ($40 USD) per person

.) Better-quality meals: Around 60,000 ARS ($60 USD) per person


Groceries:
Milk: 3,000 ARS ($3 USD)
200g of cheese: 5,000 ARS ($5 USD)
Bread: 3,000 ARS ($3 USD)
Spaghetti: 1,500 ARS ($1.50 USD)

Intransparent extra costs for credit card payments: 
Often you have to pay extra 10-20% for no understandable reason. It's really really random and intransparent. One supermarket might ask for it, the next restaurant won't, the accommodation will, the next restaurant will. Officially if you pay accomodation with credit card you shouldn't have to pay VAT - well this is not practiced here. 

Other Downsides:

1. Money-First Attitude:
I encountered overcharging and unhelpful service. For example, a cab driver demanded 11,000 ARS ($11 USD) more just for dropping off someone earlier without changing the route.


2. Overtourism:
The region is crowded with tourists (mostly from the US, Europe, and Asia) but hardly any Argentinians. Popular hikes like Fitz Roy are packed with both experienced and first-time hikers (some in sandals).


3. Limited Activities & Weather Risks:
If the weather is bad (rain or strong winds), there's not much to do besides hiking. Poor visibility may also mean you won’t see iconic views like Fitz Roy or the glacier. The weather can stay bad for days. Besides El chalten and the glacier in el calafate there is not much but windy steppe.


---

Better Alternatives:

1) Bariloche (Northern Patagonia)

.) No national park fees

.) Many amazing and uncrowded hikes, including multi-day options

.) Affordable Public transport and Uber available

.) Beautiful lakes for swimming and lush green landscapes

.) Dining out costs around 25,000 ARS ($25 USD) per person

.) Supermarket prices are a bit lower than in the south

.) A charming town vibe with plenty of Argentinians traveling there (check out the Rapa Nui chocolate shop!)


2) Chilean Patagonia

.) Prices are often 50-70% cheaper than Southern Argentina for better quality

.) Torres del Paine is crowded but offers many alternative hikes with less to no crowds

.) Food, coffee, and transportation are much more affordable. Flights are way cheaper

.) The stunning combination of mountains and water feels unique


---

If You Still Want to Visit Southern Patagonia:

1. Camp: Bring your own tent or buy one in Chile (Decathlon in Santiago is a good option). Renting in El Chaltén costs 60,000-90,000 ARS ($60-$90 USD) per day.


2. Bring Food: Stock up in Chile or more northern parts of Argentina (border checks are lax).


3. Cook Your Own Meals: Stay at places with kitchens.


4. Share Taxis or Hitchhike: Taxis can be cheaper when split among four people. Hitchhiking worked well for me.

5. Get money from western union. Best exchange rates. And paying cash almost never made you pay more - sometimes you had to pay extra tax (I didn't not until now understand why at some places I have to pay that and at others don't). Make new accounts to safe fees 

6. Start hikes before 7 am or get in the Fitzroy park on one of the many entrances, where you don't have to pay (they are actually easy to avoid, and there haven't been controls on the hike and when you exit)


7. Be Prepared to Pay (extras): Prices are high, and it’s a heavily tourist-oriented region. It seems that they know, that it is a once in a lifetime experience. It will be definitely for me at current pricing :D


---

TL;DR:

Southern Argentinian Patagonia feels overcrowded and overpriced right now. Consider Bariloche or Chilean Patagonia as better alternatives.

Kamalu eats two plates each sitting and when he is going to school, he eats one big plate in the morning to compensate for his absence. Kamalu is always salivating no matter what is being cooked, he loves every dish passionately, he doesn't have a favorite. Kamalu eats and he still hungry. I took him to the witch doctor to stitch his stomach, he told  me he doesn't want to go to prison.

Kamanga sleeps, he sleeps like he has an inheritance, he goes to bed at 7p.m and wakes up at 10a.m the following day. He can't hold a conversation without dozing, I once took him to the doctor when I thought he suffered from sleeping sickness. The doctor said the boy is strong and healthy, I couldn't believe it. I even bought the best coffee for Kamanga and he slept immediately after. The audacity!

Kachoo shits, he shits like he has to shit for all of us. When Kachoo wakes up, he wakes up running to the washroom, woe unto you if you're in it because he'll keep on knocking till you get out. When Kachoo enters the toilet you better leave the house and go as far as the town centre, it reeks. It smells so bad that you praise the Lord that shit only stinks when it leaves the bowels. I once took him to the Sangoma's to clean his stomach, I was given a bottle of medicine to give him 3 times a day. I had to give it him one big spoon because I usually go to work and come back late, the following day when Kachoo went to the toilet it reeked so bad, I had to go to get a refund and kindly asked the Sangoma to return him to his earlier state.

Kapasi preaches, he preaches like the heavens left him with a duty, he is only 12 but he preaches till he sweats and faints, we watch him keenly and when he vibrates like Nokia 110 we hold him and take him outside to get some fresh air, I'm tired! He talks and then forgets and quotes the bible, I once told him that's what Sundays are for. His teachers called me days after joining Makomba primary, they told me they wanted a student and not a pastor. I laughed it off and that day I didn't punish him because I feared the wrath of the Christian God. Kapasi dreams and says it's angel talking to him, he once bed wetted and he said that an angel had poured water on him, I'm tired!

Kadingo steals, he steals even from the less fortunate. He once stole from a blind man I asked why he did it and he told me that money is the only thing he steals, so it's the blind's man fault for having what he wants and he said that after all it's God's fault for making him poor and the blind man rich! He steals even from us the family, he doesn't like seeing any money lying around, we hide our money so well that Kadingo sleeps at 1a.m looking for it. I once took him to Pastor Mandonga, he prayed and prayed for him but Kadingo never changed.

I'm leaving, I'm going so far away so far that the gods will look for me, I'd rather be a wanderer than a prisoner in my home. At times I wonder how can a mother's womb be so mysterious one time it gives birth to a genius, another time it gives birth to a petty thief.

Irrationally anxious over it.,"Hey all, so 30/m here, I got a prescription for 10mg vyvanse generic. I've been struggling with ADHD my entire life, including trouble getting to sleep. I take melatonin every night for example. Classic wanting to do things so bad but not being able to execute. Sometimes I can, but not sustainably despite wanting to. Mind always running, songs and phrases repeating, etc. 

So I have this 10mg that I wanted to take 5mg to start. I am hyper afraid of taking a stimulant and feeling anxiety from being out of control or my heart racing etc. I was prescribed wellbutrin by a non-stimulant prescribing psych 5-7 years ago and I swallowed one pill and had a panic attack the rest of the day (from the act of taking it, not the effects.) Never took it again.

I was going to put the vyvanse in water and drink half the water to be around 5mg. I read people waking up early and taking it and going to sleep. This sounds incredibly not ideal as I don't want to ruin my sleep every day just to take vyvanse. People also say eat a big breakfast before taking it. It's hard to wake up super early and eat a big breakfast and then take it. I'm just kind of messed up on how I should take this. Ideally I would take it at like 11am after eating. But interrupting my sleep and trying to rely on getting back to sleep to take it?? Impossible for me. Been trying to eat breakfast earlier though so I'm in an overall earlier routine that could possibly work. But it's still like 930-10am by the time i eat.

I don't know, it feels messy at this point. Almost wish I had a shorter lasting vyvanse because I feel 100x more comfortable taking it after I'm up and have eaten and am at a baseline etc...

Any tips? I get soooo anxious and afraid to take it but i'm also at the point where I just don't care what happens anymore i just want to try it asap. Sorry for the ramble.

edit: also wanted to add another example - i drink half caff coffee. when i drink a full cup, i feel weird because i feel like that's ""a lot"" and a ""full dose.""",1,1738596987.0,VyvanseADHD,3,1.0,False

Just wanted to send some love and remind you that this is not the end of the world. The tunnel is dark now, but hopefully, there will be light after it. Just stay strong. 

I know how much it sucks to see the wrong sex marker on the documents - I see it daily being closeted in a society that won’t allow me to transition - but here’s what I remind myself every time it pulls me down: that a letter on a document is totally irrelevant to what I feel. It’s a typo on an email you already sent or a tweet you’ve already posted. Can’t edit it, but got to live with it. Hopefully we edit it someday. But whatever your passport says - that can not and will not invalidate what you feel or who you are. 

My sister calls me by my name, I know it hurts her when she had to introduce me to her friends as her brother, even though I’m used to that lie. But I’m fortunate to have her. Focus on such people in your life. Who make you feel better. Who make you feel good. 

Remember - the ONLY single source of your gender is what you feel. Not your passport. Not your transphobic classmate. Not the transphobic old lady you served a coffee to. Not the doctor who gave you birth. Not the government officials. Only you. 

If you say you’re a girl - hi five, girlie! I’m glad to have a sister all the way there. 

If you say you’re a man - then I’d love to tie the sacred thread in my culture that sister tie their brothers

My parents left immediately for our hometown but I stayed back till the evening because i had to work. That whole day was a blur for me, absolutely no sleep and then after a tiring day I got on a bus and travelled to my hometown alone (first solo travel). 

  
I reached there at around 6AM and then we went ahead to the morgue to get the body and we did all the rites. During the whole process, i was as emotionless as a rock. It was my first time seeing someone being incinerated and it was all just a blur. Ever since then it's been hard to accept that he's no more. While travelling I was listening to the song Kabira and now that song just keeps reminding me of that dreadful day. We had grown a bit apart but I grew up spending the summers at his place and it still feels like a stabbing feeling. Someone once said that the void hurts more than the death and that's true. Just recently I made the switch from coffee to tea for health reasons and I realised I was making it wrong. Immediately, my first thought was ""let me ask grandpa"", and then the realisation struck.

We keep it in a corner of the kitchen, away from heat sources and feed it about three cups of green waste daily. I add brown waste like coffee filters and shredded paper about once a week. I've only seen mold twice and removed it promptly both times. Our worms seem to be thriving!  
  
Lately, my partner and I have noticed tiny black flies throughout our house. They're not fruit flies. We're using a homemade trap to keep them at bay, but we'd like to get rid of their source. We think it's the worm farm, but can't figure out where they're coming from (we can't find any colonies of eggs, for example).

1igrjca,https://www.reddit.com/r/EMDR/comments/1igrjca/incredible_breakthrough_session/,Incredible breakthrough session,"Just wanted to share an incredible breakthrough session I had today. Also looking for encouragement to keep going as I felt good when it happened but now I feel very low and fragile. 

For context, I have cptsd from childhood emotional neglect and physical and emotional abuse, sexual assault at age 14, and then very shitty relationships with men ever since. 

The target I have been working on for the past few weeks is for the emotional neglect and the belief 'I don't matter'. I chose a symbolic memory of me crying alone in my room around age 7 and wanting to die. As with any complex trauma memory, once the EMDR started, it unravelled so many other memories of neglect from my mum that I hadn't even been aware of. 

A big memory was of after I was sexually assaulted, I tried to tell my mum and she ignored me. Then, a few months later, it came out that the perpetrator had assaulted 4 other girls in my school and the police got involved and my parents knew. I was offered victim support counselling through the police but my mum said 'no, she doesn't need that' (another core memory uncovered through the EMDR). The SA was then never spoken about again in my family.

This morning this memory of my mum denying me support popped up again in my EMDR session and I burst into tears for my younger self. I knew in my bones that she deserved so much more care and support for what had happened. I then imagined my ideal parent figure (kind of like me at the age I am now) taking that teenager to counselling every week. I saw the counseller telling me that I mattered and that what had happened was wrong and that I deserved to heal. I saw my ideal parent pick me up from every counselling session and drive me to a cafe to get coffee and cake. I saw us sitting in the cafe together and her holding my hand and telling me I deserved all of this care because I mattered. It broke me. 

I feel very vulnerable sharing this here but I hope it can help someone as just reading the other posts on this sub has been so incredible valuable for me. As I said at the top of my post, I'm also looking for encouragement. I felt great after the session but now feel low. Has any one else had a similar experience? Does it take a while for big insights to integrate into your life? What changes do you think i can expect to see and when?

Love to all you warriors ❤️

# How the AI Franchise Business Invite is Changing the Game for Entrepreneurs

# Introduction

The business world is changing fast. Artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer just a buzzword - it's reshaping how we work, live, and do business. For entrepreneurs, this shift brings both challenges and opportunities. That's where the AI Franchise Business Invite comes in. It's a new way for regular people to tap into the power of AI and build a successful online business.

I've spent weeks digging into this program, talking to users, and testing it out myself. In this review, I'll break down exactly what the AI Franchise is, how it works, and whether it lives up to the hype. My goal is to give you the straight facts so you can decide if it's right for you.

# Understanding the AI Franchise Business Invite

# What is AI Franchise?

At its core, the AI Franchise is a digital business package that leverages artificial intelligence to help you make money online. It's not a physical franchise like a fast food restaurant. Instead, it's a digital download that gives you access to AI-powered tools, training, and done-for-you products.

The basic idea is that you're getting a pre-built online business. The AI handles a lot of the complex, time-consuming work like finding customers and making sales. You don't need technical skills or marketing experience. The system is designed to work for complete beginners.

# The Evolution of Franchise Models

Traditional franchises usually require a huge upfront investment. You might need hundreds of thousands of dollars to open a McDonald's or Subway. There are also ongoing fees, inventory costs, and the headache of managing employees.

The AI Franchise flips this model on its head. There's no physical location, no inventory, and no employees to manage. Everything runs digitally, powered by AI. This drastically lowers the barrier to entry. Instead of needing a small fortune to get started, you can begin for less than $10.

# Key Features of the AI Franchise Business Invite

# Instant Digital Download

One of the biggest perks of the AI Franchise is that you get instant access. As soon as you purchase, you can download all the materials and start setting up your business. There's no waiting around for physical products to ship or franchise paperwork to process.

The digital format also means you can run this business from anywhere with an internet connection. Whether you're at home, traveling, or working from a coffee shop, you have everything you need at your fingertips.

# Affordable Pricing Structure

The price point is one of the most eye-catching aspects of the AI Franchise. For just $9.95, you get access to the entire system. This includes the core AI tools, training materials, and several bonus products (which we'll cover in a moment).

To put this in perspective, many online business courses cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Traditional franchises can require investments of $100,000 or more. At under $10, the AI Franchise is accessible to almost anyone who wants to give it a shot.

# Bonuses Included

On top of the core AI Franchise system, you get seven free bonuses valued at over $1,500. Here's a quick breakdown:

1. AI Traffic Machine ($197 value): Done-for-you traffic generation tools.
2. AI Franchise Playbook ($297 value): Step-by-step guide to making money quickly.
3. AI Franchise Activation Codes ($97 value): Fast-start guide to maximizing profits.
4. Millionaire-Cloning System ($67 value): Program to help you think like a millionaire.
5. Automated Customer Service Solution ($297/month value): Ready-to-use support system.
6. Live $247K Handover Session ($497 value): Live training with the creator, Michael Cheney.
7. Easy Payment Processing ($497 value): Simplified system for collecting commissions.

These bonuses add significant value to the package, giving you extra tools and training to succeed.

# Success Stories and Testimonials

# Real-world Impact

The sales page for AI Franchise features several success stories from users. One that stands out is from Steve Whitehead, who claims to be making $10,000 per month using the system. While individual results will vary, this shows the potential for significant earnings.

The creator, Michael Cheney, states that he's made over $247,584.65 with this business model. Again, this is likely not typical for all users, but it demonstrates the earning potential when the system is fully leveraged.

# Expert Endorsements

The AI Franchise has received positive feedback from several industry experts. Malcolm and Jean Shaw, experienced marketers, recommend that ""if you're any kind of marketer, I highly recommend you at least investigate AI Franchise.""

These endorsements lend credibility to the program, suggesting that it's not just hype but a legitimate business opportunity.

# Ease of Use and Accessibility

# Newbie-Friendly Approach

One of the main selling points of the AI Franchise is its accessibility for beginners. The sales page emphasizes that no tech skills are needed. Everything is designed to be user-friendly and easy to set up.

The system comes with step-by-step instructions for getting started. This means even if you've never run an online business before, you should be able to follow along and get your AI Franchise up and running.

# Hands-Free Operation

Once set up, much of the AI Franchise is designed to run on autopilot. The AI tools handle tasks like finding potential customers, generating traffic, and even making sales. This hands-free approach is ideal for people who don't have hours each day to devote to their business.

The sales page claims you can have the system set up in about 2 hours. After that, it works 24/7 on autopilot. This means you could potentially be earning money while you sleep, work your day job, or spend time with family.

# Potential for Earnings and Growth

# Earnings Potential

The AI Franchise makes some bold claims about earning potential. The sales page mentions average weekly earnings of $2,479. It also highlights examples of users making their first commission in as little as 2.5 hours and earning $354 in profit within 24 hours.

Of course, these figures should be taken with a grain of salt. Not everyone will see these results, especially right away. Your earnings will depend on factors like how well you implement the system, market conditions, and your level of effort.

# Long-term Sustainability

One question many potential buyers have is whether this business model is sustainable long-term. As AI continues to evolve, the tools provided by the AI Franchise are likely to become more powerful and effective over time.

The creator, Michael Cheney, has been in the online marketing space for over 25 years. This longevity suggests he knows how to adapt to changing market conditions. The AI Franchise appears to be designed with future growth in mind, rather than as a short-term cash grab.

# Addressing Concerns and Misconceptions

# Common Skepticism

It's natural to be skeptical of any program promising easy money online. Some common concerns include:

* ""Is this just another get-rich-quick scheme?""
* ""Can AI really do all the work for me?""
* ""What if I'm not tech-savvy?""

The AI Franchise addresses these concerns head-on. While it does promise a relatively easy way to make money, it's not claiming you'll get rich overnight with zero effort. The AI tools do a lot of heavy lifting, but you'll still need to put in some work to set everything up and manage your business.

As for technical skills, the program is designed to be as user-friendly as possible. If you can follow simple instructions and use basic computer functions, you should be able to handle the AI Franchise setup.

# Risk Management

To ease potential buyers' minds, the AI Franchise comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with the program, you can get a full refund. Plus, they let you keep your copy of the materials.

This guarantee significantly reduces the risk of trying out the AI Franchise. For less than $10, you can test the system for a full month with no financial risk.

# How to Get Started with AI Franchise

# Step-by-Step Activation Guide

Getting started with the AI Franchise is designed to be straightforward:

1. Purchase the program for $9.95.
2. Download the digital materials immediately.
3. Follow the step-by-step setup instructions in the AI Franchise Playbook.
4. Activate the AI tools using the provided activation codes.
5. Start implementing the strategies to generate traffic and sales.

The entire setup process is estimated to take about 2 hours. After that, the AI systems should start working for you automatically.

# Marketing and Sales Strategies

While the AI handles much of the marketing and sales process, there are strategies you can use to maximize your results:

1. Leverage the included AI Traffic Machine to drive targeted visitors to your offers.
2. Use the provided content and promotional materials to engage potential customers.
3. Implement the tips from the Millionaire-Cloning System to optimize your business mindset.
4. Attend the live training session to get personalized guidance from Michael Cheney.

Remember, while the AI does a lot of work, your success will still depend on how effectively you implement these strategies.

At school, there is a plastic water bottle (with a sports cap). This bottle is sealed tightly.This bottle is filled a quarter way up with water and  the following  substances:
1) 1 unboiled pork sausage ( with plastic wrapper)
2) a pack of instant coffee 
3) a handful of gummy bears
4) 1 mint mentos
4) An olive
5) A handful of sugary candies

Over the past two weeks, this elixir has been held on the radiator, where it received plenty of heating everyday and was not opened . Today, we opened the sports cap in fear of the bottle exploding and a concerningly large cloud of gas was released. I have  fermented before and for just two weeks ( and no special fermenting ingredients), the explosion was massive. It sprayed a cloud of nasty smelling liquid about 40 cm out of the window ( where we opened it). My question is this - what could be causing this liquid to ferment so quickly? We didn't add in any yeast, so is the sugar from the various sweets really just being eaten by the yeast from the olive? My follow up question would be how dangerous is it to actually drink a small quantity of this liquid? Thanks.",0,1738595779.0,fermentation,13,0.25,False

'Self Portrait As A Coffee Pot' has a couple of episodes listed as well. There may well be others from other series I've not noticed. 

Put aside the fact that I hated The Kingdom, as a series, the individual episodes have no place in a list that describes itself as ""**The greatest** ***films*** **ever made, as voted by MUBI’s global community of film lovers.**"" That's 5 slots given over to 2 episodic shows rather than 5 stand-alone feature/short films.

Posting from a throwaway because I don’t want anyone I know to come across this. I feel pathetic enough already. 


I (23, F) have been with my boyfriend (27, M) for about 7 months now. We kind of knew of each other for a while before we got together. I can't share the details of how we met and how we got together since that would be a giveaway but I can tell you that I don’t even have the words to describe how much I love this man. He’s my calm, my steady. Even now, months later, it still feels like we’re in those early, swoony dating days.


Over these past months, I’ve met most of his friends, some more than one time. Many of them are older than me, but they’ve always been welcoming and I've felt comfortable. One of his friends, L (F, 27 ?)  and my boyfriend get along incredibly well. There’s an ease between them that comes from knowing someone for a long time. My boyfriend is a reserved person, but with L, he talks more openly. Comfortably. They're familiar in a way that I assumed was just years of friendship. 
Last week we were at a small gathering—just a few of his close friends, a late-night thing. I was sitting next to one of his other friends, making conversation, when one of them said something about L. I don't remember what exactly, since I was talking to another one of them at that time, but he mentioned my boyfriend and L. He was laughing about something, and then—so casually he said, ""Well, yeah, I mean, they were together for what, four, five years?"" 


In all this time together my boyfriend has never mentioned that? All those times we hung out with L, he never bought it up?? We've talked about past relationships in passing. But even then he never said anything about it. 


I don't even remember how I reacted when I heard. I mean his friend wasn't talking to me so I didn't have to say anything but I think my mind pretty much blanked out. 


I don’t really know what to make of all of this. On one hand, the way my boyfriend and his ex, L, interact, and the ease and casualness with which their friends talk about their past, makes me think that maybe it was just a clean breakup. Maybe they’ve moved on and are just friends now—friends with shared history, but nothing more. But then again, I can’t help but look at them in a different light now. He has other female friends, and I’ve met some of them. He’s always warm and friendly with everyone, but there’s something different when it comes to L. It’s almost like a completely different side of him comes out when they’re together. But maybe that’s just what happens when two people have had history? My boyfriend and L are also in a program together, and I know that sometimes they hang out after class in the cafeteria or study together in the library. I've never thought it unusual for two friends who have the same classes to spend time together, but now I don't know what I think about it. This one time we hung out before his class and on his way to class he grabbed a coffee for L (they were going to go over their notes before class). Maybe it's routine for them ? But then again, this happened around the second month of us dating so maybe he doesn't do it anymore ? 
I know this might seem shallow, but I’m genuinely head over heels for this guy. I go to bed on many nights thinking he’s the one for me.


And now, I’m stuck in this spiral. Did he not tell me because he didn’t think it was important? Or does he still hold onto that relationship in some way and didn't want me to know? 


I have thought about bringing this up to him but what if he says it was a thing in the past and he didn't tell me because it didn't matter.  I think that might be why I haven't brought this up yet. I think that's why I haven't talked to him about this yet. Because I don't know how I'd push it if he brushes it off and I still can't shake this feeling. 


I'm scared that this might mean something I don’t want it to mean. I don’t want to be the girl who overthinks and overcomplicates everything, especially since I'm younger than all of them and at times I feel like a child, but I can’t help but feel like I’m not in the loop here. 
Maybe I’m just reading into things too much, especially since we’ve only been dating for 7 months. But with everything else in our relationship being so amazing, I can’t help but feel like this is a small thing that could quietly mess with my peace of mind if I let it. 
Should I bring this up to him? Any advice on how to approach this or if I’m just being silly would be greatly appreciated.

**TL; DR; : I (23, F) been dating my boyfriend (27, M) for 7 months, and I’m really in love with him. I recently found out from one of his friends that he was in a long-term relationship with his close friend, L (27, F), which he never mentioned. They still hang out together often—studying, having lunch after class. I’m starting to feel insecure because his relationship with her always felt different from his other female friends, and I'm starting to look at it differently now.I’m not sure if I’m overthinking, but I’m worried I’m not in the loop.

My plan is to adjust my sleep pattern by one hour each night in the nine days leading up to the trip. That means I'm trying to go to sleep and wake up one hour earlier each day. Basically treating each day as though it has 23 hours rather than 24. In this way I hope to be resetting my body clock to Paris time by the time I arrive on the continent. Essentially I'll be ""springing forward"" for nine straight days leading up to my departure.

If I'm able to follow through on my plan I'll be going to bed at 1pm next Sunday (no Super Bowl party for me) and waking around 10pm. This schedule translates into 10pm to 7am Paris time. My flight leaves Seattle around noon (Seattle time) on Monday, by which time I should be just about ready to go to sleep for most of the flight, which arrives in Paris around 8am. If everything goes to plan I will be rested and ready to start the first day of my Paris adventure with a nice cup of coffee and a croissant.

Of course, this whole crazy experiment relies on my being able to sleep on the plane, which is not a given. I'm hoping that by having been up for around 14–15 hours by the time we're airborne helps.

Has anyone here ever attempted something like this before or heard of the practice? I'm certainly not breaking new ground here. I'd love to hear about any experiences and any tips you might have. ",2,1738595695.0,TravelHacks,10,0.75,False

In 2020 bought a MSI GF75 Thin 9SC, lasted for years and sold it to a friend in 2024 after changing the battery, and it’s still running despite me spilling beer/coffee on it like 4 times. However, I graduated in college around 2021 so I never moved it again from my desk, except when traveling (for work purposes, I have a side hustle).

So I bought what everyone says: mid laptop and good pc. Last year, I bought an ASUS Zenbook and built a 4060 PC. It was awesome, however, I didn’t game as much as I used to and since I now WFH along with my side hustle, I don’t have the energy to sit at my desk to play. I have used Moonlight/Sunshine to stream games to my laptop so I can game everywhere inside my house, but I still think that it’s wasteful to have 2 PCs, plus, I do my side-hustle from my gaming PC as well so it’s like a work machine.

Now the final question: Bought a ThinkCentre to take care of my side hustle, business grade with extending warranty. Great. Now I want to sell both my laptop and PC for the following:

- MacBook Air M4 + GeForce Now (satisfied as of now with the results of GFN)
- Gaming laptop

A MacBook because they retain value as gaming laptops, Windows non-gaming laptops lose a lot of value in my country. My main gripe with my MSI was battery life and build quality… so are gaming laptops good now? In terms of battery and build quality? I would love something like my Zenbook (aluminum, oled screen, 120Hz, good color accuracy) with the battery life of the newest intel chips.

*TLDR: Do gaming laptops now have aluminum, good quality chassis and battery life?*

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

There have been a new series of buzz feeds, making their way on many platforms, and they are directing us, if we want to be successful to get off the social media buffet and dive into micro-learning. Now, perhaps I am extremely jaded or biased because I know that when you first awake, your brain elevates to the Theta wave, which is the same frequency achieved in most hypnosis sessions. So the brain is, in my opinion,and obviously others too, in an optimal state for retention, comprehension, and absorption. Perhaps it is what leads me to do my readings from research or courses with my morning coffee, where I find my most creative writing time after coming back from my walk. I wrote previously that the eyes and your vision can only interpret that which the mind can comprehend, and much along those lines is once new understanding and knowledge is attained, your thinking is not the same. 
There have been several promoters about the fact that post secondary school is NOT to teach you something specific, but it is to get you to learn HOW to LEARN. Like the profound Walt Whitman wrote as recited by the ever-so-lovable Ted Lasso, ""learn to be curious, not judgemental."" 
♡
If you are in the beginning phases of becoming curious, about subjects and about discovering more about self, hypnotherapy can aide in getting you to a proper emotional and mental state to explore uninterrupted by judgements and critical thinking, your potentialliality. Life is always full with options.
Call or DM EDN Hypnotherapy Clinic to arrange your free half-hour consultation.
Be well.

1igqqdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/IKEA/comments/1igqqdx/recommendations_for_kitchen_counter_divider/,"Recommendations for kitchen counter ""divider""","I have an issue that I need some creative minds input on! 

I'm currently building a sort of bar/coffee/tea counter on one side of my kitchen. The space is two meters long almost exactly, which fits nicely with four METOD cabinets. 

My original plan was to do 60-40-60-40, with the first 40 being a tall closet type METOD in order to separate these two areas for different uses, and give more tall space. 

But, due to mounting issues (separate height for wall-hanging the tall 40) making it tedious to get this to be perfectly same height at the bottom, I figure I might just go with all of them low (80 tall, standard height). 

But this creates a conundrum. I do want to separate the two sides for different uses, and don't need a two meter bench for my bar needs. 60-100 cm is perfectly enough for that. 

So what could I use as a divider? Seeing as I'm putting a hardwood slab over all the low cabinets now, preferably something that I can move/remove as needed or if I move, leaving a flat space which is probably more appealing to whoever moves in here after me. 

Preferably it'd be functional, sort of like the tall 40 was intended to be. Some kind of storage that I can use for the bar/coffee station on the left side of it.

I'm in the middle of arranging his cremation. Family has been coming and going. Friends have been visiting. He was part of a band, so they're in charge of music. Other than the exorbitant costs of luke-warm coffee, it's going fairly smooth.

But everyone around me tells me how hard it's going to be. How I won't be able to sleep for a few weeks, how eating is hard for a few days or how I should just let the tears flow when I feel them.

The thing is, I feel relatively fine. I'm sad he's gone, but glad it was peaceful and that he was looking out onto nature. I reminisce about what great a dad he was, but after the first two days, I don't feel like crying that much anymore. I look at his pictures and feel... Nostalgia, maybe? When I'm hungry, I eat. When I'm tired, I sleep. I feel like I'm tired and heavier, but not necessarily sadness.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I cant believe what a great colony exploitation simulator it is.","I was trying to explain to a friend how this game absolutely nails colonial exploitation, and makes you feel it. It feels so easy forcing my poor new world folks to farm cotton and rum and coffee. How happy are they? Meh! They don't contribute substantially in dollars other than the crops and goods i need there. Other than the mild newspaper stories, their plight doesn't affect my investors lives at all. But my investors and artisans LOVE their coffee apparently.  Right now i am moving all my heavy industry to a nearby island just to get rid of the pollution. Do i care about that nearby island? Quite a bit less than my main island. Out of sight, out of mind!

And it also is a real eye opener when you have a ton of delicately balanced cargo ships crisscrossing the globe, and Beryl declares war on you and just wrecks your entire economy with a few well-placed attack ships. I haven't found the escorting functionality to be very effective, So I end up having to lead my poor oil tankers across the ocean manually. 

The enemy AI is a little questionable, the AI always underestimates the number and strength of ships needed to bring down a defended outpost, but it's still very fun for me at least. 

I have been very happy with this game, i don't know how i missed it when it came out. It fills the hole left by frostpunk.

In the same way i think kerbal space program should be required for any astronomy class, I think world history classes should spend a week with this game to really drive home the horrors of colonialism.

I met him through CMB. A doctor, my age, and someone who just clicked with me. Our conversations over the past two weeks had been easy, fluid, and consistent—something I deeply appreciated. He was thoughtful, attentive, and made me feel comfortable. I liked that about him.

Those two weeks were probably the best I’d had in a while. He gave me something to look forward to. I caught myself thinking about him randomly throughout the day, wondering how he was doing, waiting for his texts.

We finally decided to meet on February 2 at a restaurant near my place. Funny enough, we both arrived an hour early for different reasons—I thought we didn’t have a reservation, and he, being the considerate planner he was, had actually booked a table an hour before our scheduled time. That made me smile.

The date itself was… lovely. We talked about his work, our past relationships, our perspectives on life and career. It felt effortless, yet I was oddly anxious. I was so attracted to him that I could barely eat. His presence was calm—malumanay—and the way he made these tiny, funny micro-expressions was something I’d never seen before. His smile was bright and warm. I could have stared at him forever.

After lunch, we decided to get coffee, but somehow ended up with a Pink Drink instead. He introduced me to it, and I found it amusing—this tall, accomplished doctor enjoying something so unapologetically feminine. But it was endearing. He was endearing.

Neither of us liked the cold, so we spent a bit of time finding the perfect spot to sit. He was patient with me, just as he had been in our conversations, and I appreciated that more than I let on.

The date could have ended there, but it didn’t. I had planned to run in Ayala after, and it became the perfect excuse to drive him to Makati. I figured I’d drop him off at his condo, say goodbye, and that would be it. But he surprised me.

Instead of heading home, he insisted that I go ahead with my run, and he’d just walk from the park. But then he waited. He waited for me to change, and when I stepped out, he walked with me.

That moment will stay with me. That simple, unexpected act of kindness. A part of me is afraid that every time I run in that park, I’ll think of him.

That night, he texted me (non-verbatim): “I was happy to spend the day with you.”

I was happy too. But the conversation didn’t last long, and the next day, he didn’t reach out. 

I won’t force anything. I won’t chase him. But I won’t pretend it doesn’t hurt.

Whatever happens, I hope he finishes his residency with ease. I hope he finds the work-life balance he longs for. He doesn’t know this, but I will always be rooting for him.

And every time I have a Pink Drink, I will think of him.",1,1738592490.0,coffeemeetsbagel,1,0.67,False

\-------------------------------  
Tim was still kneeling in front of Nuria, the damp, ruined Superman T-shirt in his hands as he carefully polished her shoes. The television played in the background, but he barely registered the images. Nuria sat back comfortably, her legs crossed lazily, enjoying the attention he was giving her.

When he finally thought he was done, he took a relieved breath and looked up. “I’m finished,” he said softly.

Nuria glanced at him briefly, her eyes gleaming with amusement. “The bottom too,” she said casually, as if it were the most normal request in the world.

Tim hesitated for a second, but then, without arguing, he lifted her foot and began cleaning the soles of her shoes. The dirt from outside had left faint streaks, and he rubbed them away as best he could. Nuria watched him with a satisfied expression, occasionally glancing at the TV.

After another five minutes, he placed her foot back down carefully. “Now I’m done,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Nuria smirked. “The movie isn’t over yet,” she noted, stretching her arms above her head. She let out a small yawn before turning her gaze back to him. “You seem to be very grateful to my feet, Timmy. First, you borrow my shoes, and now you’re shining them like a pro.” She tilted her head. “Tell me… don’t you think they deserve a massage after such a long day?”

Tim didn’t respond right away, unsure of how to react. His hands twitched slightly on his lap.

Nuria gave him a pointed look. “Take my shoes off.”

Tim swallowed hard, then obeyed. He gently slid her feet out of the polished shoes, setting them aside. Nuria wiggled her toes slightly, stretching them out.

“Well?” she said expectantly, raising an eyebrow.

Tim hesitated once more but then reached for her feet, his fingers pressing softly against them. He started massaging, his hands working carefully, trying to do a decent job.

“Mmm,” Nuria hummed in approval. Pausing the movie. “That actually feels nice.” She let her head rest against the back of the couch, closing her eyes for a moment. “You’re surprisingly good at this. Did you know you had such a hidden talent, Timmy?”

Tim didn’t answer, focusing on the movement of his hands.

“I could get used to this,” she mused, tilting her head slightly as she watched him again. “In fact… I think I want this every evening from now on.”

Tim finally spoke. “I—I don’t know if I can do this every evening,” he said hesitantly.

Nuria clicked her tongue in disapproval. “Oh, Timmy, Timmy, Timmy…” She shook her head, a small smirk on her lips. “You don’t seem to understand. I wasn’t asking.”

Tim’s fingers slowed for a moment before continuing.

She sighed deeply, enjoying the massage. “See? You’re such a fast learner. “

She pressed play on the movie and stretched her arms again, her body fully relaxed. “Heavenly,” she murmured, barely audible. “Keep going.”

Tim obeyed, his fingers working across the soles of her feet as she occasionally gave him small, precise instructions on how to do it better.

When the movie finally ended, he instinctively stopped.

Nuria opened one eye and let out a playful sigh. “Oh, what a shame… Maybe I shouldn’t have given you a time limit.”  ‘Tomorrow, though, we won’t put a time limit on it. You’ll stop when I say so.” She sat up and leaned slightly towards him, ruffling his hair as if he were a child.

Tilting his chin up with her fingers, she locked eyes with him and smiled. “You’re such a good boy, Timmy. These six months on trial are a gift for both of us.”

With that, she stood up and walked towards her bedroom. Tim remained on the floor for a few moments, staring blankly at the screen. Only after five minutes did he finally stand, his body heavy with exhaustion, and head to his own room.

 

The morning was quiet. Too quiet.

Tim sat at the breakfast table, stirring his coffee absentmindedly. Across from him, Nuria scrolled through her phone, occasionally taking a small bite of her toast. The atmosphere was… normal. Unusually so. There was no tension, no demands, no sarcastic remarks from her.

And for that, Tim was grateful.

He focused on his breakfast, enjoying the rare peace. It felt like a brief return to sanity, a reminder that maybe—just maybe—things could be normal between them. He dared to believe that, for once, it would be an ordinary day.

Nuria barely spoke. She was fully engrossed in whatever was on her screen, her fingers lazily tapping the glass every few seconds. At one point, she chuckled softly at something she read, but other than that, she remained quiet.

Tim finished his toast and checked his watch. It was time to leave for work. He stood up, took his empty plate to the sink, and wiped his hands on a dish towel. Then, as he reached for his bag, he casually said, “I’ll be heading out now.”

Still no reaction from Nuria.

Good.

Feeling relieved, he made his way toward the door and reached into his pocket—only to find it empty.

His keys weren’t there.

Frowning, he patted his other pocket. Nothing. He checked his jacket, his bag—still nothing. His heart sank slightly as he turned around, scanning the room. He had left them on the table, hadn’t he?

Just as he was about to retrace his steps, a familiar jingling sound made him freeze.

Tim slowly turned his head toward Nuria.

She was still seated, still scrolling through her phone, but now, in her other hand, she was casually twirling his car keys around her finger. The soft clinking of metal filled the otherwise silent room.

For a moment, Tim just stared.

Nuria didn’t even look at him. She simply continued flicking her finger, letting the keys spin in lazy circles.

His stomach tightened. He should’ve known. He should’ve expected this.

Tim forced a small, polite smile. “Right,” he said quietly.

Then, without another word, he turned toward the door and walked outside.

He felt Nuria’s gaze on his back as he left.

The rain had stopped, but the air was damp, the streets still glistening from the morning drizzle. Tim pulled his jacket closer around him as he made his way to the bus stop, his footsteps slow, measured. Another long day was ahead of him.

 

By the time Tim finally got home, it was already well past dinner. He felt the weight of exhaustion settle into his bones, his entire body aching from a grueling shift. He had been forced to work extra hours, a direct consequence of his recent lateness. Every second at work had dragged on, making his already long day feel endless.

All he wanted now was to sit down, eat something, and get some rest.

As he stepped into the dimly lit apartment, he saw Nuria sprawled across the couch, one leg tucked under her, the other lazily draped over the armrest. She was flipping through channels with one hand while casually twirling a strand of her dark hair with the other. She didn’t even glance at him as he set his bag down.

Tim sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “Is there anything left from dinner?” he asked, his voice quieter than usual.

Nuria finally looked at him, an amused smirk playing on her lips. “There’s still some pizza in the fridge,” she said. “Should still be good.”

Before he could respond, she pushed herself off the couch and headed towards the kitchen.

Tim frowned slightly. “It’s okay, I can get it myself—”

“Nonsense,” Nuria interrupted, already pulling open the fridge. “I like helping you out sometimes.”

Tim didn’t know how to feel about that. It wasn’t like Nuria to do something out of kindness—at least, not without a reason.

He watched as she took out the cold pizza and placed it in the microwave. As the low hum filled the kitchen, she leaned against the counter, arms crossed, her expression unreadable. “I don’t usually eat pizza from the microwave,” she mused, tapping her fingers against her arm. “But you, Timmy, you should definitely eat your pizza.”

Something in her tone made him uneasy, but he didn’t argue.

The microwave beeped. Nuria opened it, wrinkling her nose slightly as the scent of warm—but far from fresh—pizza filled the air. She slid the slice onto a plate and set it down on the table in front of Tim. “Bon appétit,” she said with a sweet, almost mocking smile.

As she stepped back, she murmured under her breath, “Oof, I wouldn’t eat that.”

Tim sat down, staring at the pizza in front of him. It was Hawaiian. He didn’t even like pineapple on pizza, but the worst part? It was covered in mushrooms. He hated mushrooms.

Still, he was too drained to argue.

Just as he reached for the slice, Nuria tilted her head, watching him closely. “Aren’t you forgetting something, Timmy?”

He looked up, confused. “What?”

She raised a brow. “Shouldn’t you say thank you when someone makes you food?”

Tim exhaled slowly and forced himself to nod. “Thank you, Nuria.”

She smiled, but there was something smug about it. She wasn’t done.

“You know…” she said, tapping a finger against her chin, “I don’t think it’s fair that I give you a cute little nickname, and you still call me just ‘Nuria.’”

Tim blinked. “What do you mean?”

Nuria took a step closer, placing a hand on the back of his chair. “I think you should call me something more… respectful.”

There was a pause. A deliberate one.

Tim hesitated. “Like… what?”

She grinned, as if the perfect idea had just come to her. “I think ‘Miss Nuria’ has a nice ring to it.”

Tim felt his stomach tighten. The room was silent, except for the faint sound of the television playing in the background.

She waited.

Tim lowered his gaze, staring at the unappetizing pizza on his plate. His throat felt dry. Finally, just loud enough for her to hear, he muttered, “…Thank you, Miss Nuria.”

Nuria’s smirk widened.

“See? That wasn’t so hard,” she said, running a finger over the top of his head in a teasing gesture before stepping away.

Tim clenched his jaw slightly but said nothing.

“Eat up, Timmy,” she called over her shoulder as she returned to the couch, stretching out comfortably.

With quiet reluctance, Tim picked up the slice and took a bite. The texture was rubbery, the pineapple sickeningly sweet, and the mushrooms… slimy. He forced himself to chew.

Nuria watched him out of the corner of her eye, her satisfied grin never fading.

Tim swallowed.

He had never felt less hungry in his life.

 

A Long Night of Service

Tim could barely keep his eyes open. His entire body ached from the long, exhausting day, and all he wanted to do was collapse into bed and let sleep take over.

As he pushed his chair back from the table, he exhaled deeply and glanced over at Nuria, who was still lounging on the couch. “Goodnight, Miss Nuria,” he said quietly, hoping she would let him go without any further demands.

But as soon as the words left his mouth, she turned her head slightly, one eyebrow arching. “Aren’t you forgetting something, Timmy?”

Tim hesitated. His shoulders stiffened. “What do you mean?”

Nuria let out a small sigh and stretched her arms above her head before rolling her shoulders back. “You had a long day, didn’t you?”

Tim nodded, rubbing the back of his neck. “Yeah… I’m exhausted.”

She smiled sweetly. “Well, I’m not. And I believe you still owe me a foot massage.”

Tim felt a lump form in his throat. He had almost forgotten.

Nuria curled her legs up onto the couch, tucking them under her for a moment before stretching them back out. “You know, my feet deserve love too,” she said, wiggling her toes. “All that walking today… I think they earned it.”

Tim swallowed hard, glancing at the clock. It was already late. Maybe if he gave her a quick massage, she would let him go to bed soon.

But then she added something else—something that made his heart sink.

“Tonight is special,” she said with a satisfied sigh. “No time limits. I’ll decide when we’re done.”

Tim’s stomach clenched. He had no idea how long this would last.

With a small, amused smile, Nuria grabbed the ottoman and dragged it closer to the couch, propping her feet up onto it. She leaned back into the cushions, making herself comfortable. “Alright,” she murmured, snapping her fingers and pointing at her feet. “Let’s begin.”

Tim took in a slow breath before lowering himself onto his knees in front of her. His hands hovered over her bare feet for a moment before he finally touched them, starting to knead gently into the soft arches.

The moment he began, Nuria let out a pleased hum. “Mmm, this is heavenly,” she murmured, stretching her toes slightly. “And the best part? Knowing that this isn’t just a quick little thing… but something that will last.”

Tim didn’t respond. He focused on the massage, hoping that if he did a good enough job, maybe she would let him stop sooner rather than later.

But Nuria had no such plans.

She grabbed the remote and pressed play on her favorite show, settling in as if she were at a luxury spa. The minutes dragged on. One episode finished, then another.

An hour passed.

Tim’s fingers were aching, his shoulders sore from bending over for so long. He looked up at her and swallowed. “Miss Nuria… I think I should get some sleep now. I have work early in the morning.”

Nuria didn’t even look at him. Her eyes were still on the screen, her expression relaxed. “Mmm… I’m not tired yet, though.”

Tim clenched his jaw but didn’t argue. His hands continued their slow, repetitive motions.

Another episode ended.

Another half-hour passed.

Tim was barely keeping his head up. His eyes felt heavy, his arms weak. His thumbs moved over her soles almost mechanically now, the rhythm slow and tired.

Nuria, on the other hand, looked completely at ease.

After two full hours, she finally let out a small yawn and stretched. “That was a fantastic evening,” she sighed, shifting slightly in her seat. “I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did, Timmy.”

Tim’s fingers slipped away from her feet as he straightened his back, his muscles sore and stiff. He didn’t answer. He didn’t have the energy to.

Nuria stood up, running a hand through her hair. “I think this might just be the perfect way to end every night, don’t you think?” she mused aloud before smirking at him. “Well, at least for me.”

Tim forced himself not to react.

With one last stretch, she sighed. “Alright, I think I’m ready to sleep now.”

Relief washed over Tim—until she added one final thing.

“But before you head to bed, make sure to clean everything up.” She gave him a small pat on the cheek before turning toward the hallway. “Sleep well, Timmy.”

And just like that, she disappeared into her room, leaving Tim alone, exhausted, and defeated.

For a moment, he just sat there, staring at the floor.

Then, with slow, sluggish movements, he forced himself up to clean. Only when everything was spotless did he finally drag himself to bed, dreading what tomorrow might bring.

Around August  after being unable to lose weight forever I suspected my cortisol levels were high and under the direction of the doctor I started some supplements to manage and the weight came pouring off.  At that time I was around 230 lbs.

As a side effect the quantity of food I eat is much less and seems to have lead to constipation.  I've had this happen in the past as well when reducing intake but it was only for a day or two.

Morning meal - 4 muffin tins of baked egg whites, broccoli and cheese

Lunch 4 days a week - 40oz of salad consisting of dark green leaf mix, half a bag of matchbox carrot sticks, half a bell pepper, broccoli, half a cucumber, 2 sticks of celery, feta cheese, sunflower kernels and 150g chicken.

Dinner - usually 50g of protein, usually via 150g chicken and some vegetable.

The weight loss has been amazing and lower cortisol has lead to much less need for snacking but as a side effect I've become constipated.  I'm working with the doctor who recommended some magnesium to see if that helps.  I'm wondering if I'm eating too little or too much fiber.

In the past adding metamucil has made things worse.  I usually drink between 96 and 128oz of water and exercise for 45+ minutes a day 4-5 days a week.

Prior to the weight loss for about 15 years I'd use 2 cups of coffee to manage this but its no longer working.  It has been like clockwork for 15 years.  I'm wondering what my diet is missing or has that could be leading to this.",1,1738592349.0,diet,7,1.0,False

I just launched a small project and am trying to figure out how to reach my target audience, which includes small coffee shops, food places, boutiques, hair salons, nail salons, and similar businesses—especially those with only 1 to 3 workers.

This is my first time trying to market something. I know there are groups on Reddit like ProductHunters or SideProjects where you can share your project, but I’m not sure if I can reach my target audience there.

Maybe some of you have had a similar experience or have ideas on how I could reach my audience?

Thanks in advance! 🙂",0,1738592274.0,smallbusiness,2,0.5,False

As the year-end bonus is upon us, I’m thinking of taking a proper barista class before plunging on a big end-game investment of espresso set-up. Several questions for all enthusiasts here:

1. Do you think a course as such is needed? I’m completely new to anything coffee therefore the feel to need one

2. For those in London, which course that has the best value for money?

Many thanks!",1,1738592146.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
