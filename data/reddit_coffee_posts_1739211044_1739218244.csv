About me: I'm 23 and I go to school for forensics. I like to play games (board games, video games, dnd, etc.), watch horror movies, go thrifting (I'm really into fashion/style), try new coffee/tea places, write, skate and take hikes/walks. 

I'm 6'1, skinny, tan skin, curly brown hair to my shoulders, brown eyes, and I usually dress more alternative/goth/dark.

I'd say for my personality, I'm very down-to-earth but also full of energy/socialness, curious/adventurous, open-minded, creative, and just generally easy-going and fun-loving. My love language is quality time, and my personality type is ENFP.

 I tried to be friends with her, but she doesn't care. I told her it was no use being her friend when I exist solely on chatting apps. 

We never see each other or spend quality time together. She wanted to give me some gifts because of how much I've helped her and her band with thier record. I don't want gifts. I want to be with my friend. 

But at the same time, everything I do or say she uses it against me. I told her I can't no longer stand the push-pull circle after she said: ¨But it doesnt have to be a goodbye, people come and go¨ NO! NO! FUCK NO! 



I am tired of feeling like a doormat. If I am not use for her (because I suppose whatever love she has for me is related to what material good I can provide) and she doesn't even bring herself for a coffee and talk things face to face then we're not friends.

1imfm7f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1imfm7f,Itchy feet... #3,"The rain continued the night I landed here in Russelville. I waddled in an awkward penguin fashion, completely soaked. The wind ripped through my clothes. Shivering. 
Just had left that gas station where I got the first warm meal I'd had in weeks. Did the penguin shuffle all the way to walmart, 2 miles across town. Wind and rain be damned.

As soon as I hobbled into the store, some old lady was like, ""You're the one who I saw walking some miles back!"" Or some bullshit she said, because I can't remember details. That, and this is a real story. Not that bs fanfiction I see from time to time.
My thought was like, holy fuck if I was that significant at least help lol.

We stood there and talked, I was hoping for cash. She said she felt sorry for me, that she'd pray for me, and with that I never saw her again.
I bought a cold weather bag, having just landed in a new town.(I don't carry bags outside of town, slows me down.)

 Knowing damn good and well nobody owes me a darn thing despite ol Karen probably having enough in her savings account to start a small nation. I was kind of upset at the interaction.  We talked for 15 minutes and I gained nothing from it, physically.

I was exhausted, grumpy. This lifestyle kicks your ass daily. Perhaps that's why I was so moody. Found a wooded area across from walmart to crash on Google maps. Walked down the road in the rain and pitch black. Sure enough, cars. 

You ever been out in the middle of nowhere, ain't shit for miles? You been walking 3 days, not a house, not even a car passes by; suddenly you unbundled your belt to piss and a marching band goes by, with boxo flipping you the finger? 
Yeah. That fucking feeling. 

Anyways every car made me more and more frustrated.  This long road was dead before I decided to hide in the woods to sleep. Now it's as busy as the interstate.
I fall and bust my ass climbing a fence, slipped on some wet leaves. Knocked the wind outta me but I got up and carried on. Got them Scottish and Viking ancestors, baby! (Thanks for confirming ancestry.com lol)

Crashed out. Ain't shit happened. Woke up to a deer coughing. Motherfucker sounded like he been smoking camel full flavors since the seventies. I remember asking if it wanted to do some gay sex and I heard it run off. ""Guess not!"" 
Anyways. Burned one. Went back to sleep.

6am that next morning, I had my ass sitting at the gas station nursing a smoke and coffee. Old redneck ""I worked m' whole doggarned life n u should have to too"" guy gets out of his pickup. Stares at me like I'm breaking the law so I immediately was like ""know where I can find work?"" bullshit to satiate the blue collars around me. I'll be damned if he wasn't a contractor.

I told him I'm a former carpenter and worked 2 years in construction (both true) and he was about to take me for the day to work.
Except I'm sitting there, in a pair of flip flops as my only shoes. Declined, told him I'd be around. Next time with boots on. Never saw him again. That was last Friday.

Went to the library, bathed in the sink. Sat at the entrance charging my phone. A lady came up and gave me $100. I thanked her so freaking much. I really needed that. Spent the day doing about that much. Nothing.

Walked the whole mile across town to get back to walmart. Bought a can of cold chili and 4 deli hotdogs. Oh my God, best darn meal I'd had in awhile. 
On second thought, everything is the best thing you've ever eaten on the road... Even cold chef boyardee tastes amazing. I digress.

I slept behind the dollar tree that night. Hatched this big idea that I was going to make and sell shepherds slings or some shit. ""OnLy FiVe DoLlHuRs EaCh"" I thought it was a good idea at the time. 
Should've bought a fuckin clown outfit instead and wore it for thinking such bs would work. 

I walked around town the next day, flipped the local confederate memorial statue off in the town square in front of everyone, pissed on the founder of russelvilles grave (a proud slave owner mind you) in broad daylight, and left offerings of coins and tobacco to the local slave cemetery in rememberance of their lives.
I apologized to them, told them how my 3rd great grandfather was a union soldier. I had a heart to heart, with their spirits; with the wind...
Jesus I've been alone too long. Losing my mind.
In whatever case I felt better.

How my wife and I would've never been able to have our beautiful biracial baby boy if we were alive back then with these cowards running amuck.

Anyways made slings. Flew signs all day about them being only 5 bucks. Basically got laughed at and everything but wedgied and wet willied. 
Hung around Casey's, some lady offered to buy me shoes. Said she would be back here tomorrow morning.
I thanked her. So now I had to stick nearby Caseys for ease of getting back. 
Found this big isolated area of woods. Pinned on maps. Smoked and finished my coffee.

Rain was a comin'. I could feel it. Checked the weather app. Sure enough. I set out up the street. Had to get my shelter set up before it all began. 

Dark, isolated, and middle of nowhere kind of street. I mean these woods were big. Unsurmountale rock face to my left, steep drop-off to my right. Damn man. I hadn't really seen any cars either.  Pitch black. 
I found an opening where  i could climb up.

As soon as I went to step into the woods. I heard the sound of a car coming around the bend. So I waited around, acted as though I was walking alongside the road to not draw suspicion.

Then another car. Another car. I sat down n lit up a cigarette, man. Fuck all yall I'm done playing this game. Had me pissed. Every. Single. Time.

Finally, I found my opening, walked through the dark woods. Got set up, about an hour went by or something.

The usual noises. Fox screaming, sounding like a woman being murdered. The terrifying garble of a racoon that sounds like a mountain lion yell. The sound of the woods moving All around me in the dark is nothing new.
But then, I heard what made the hair stand up on the back of my neck.

That distinct noise. The shuffling of human feet in the leaves. Man, I sat there frozen. Scrambled to get my pepper spray ready. I thought I must've been caught, or seen coming into the woods; followed even.

I sat there, listened to the branches break under their feet. Only two things break branches in the woods. Predators, and humans.
Either way, had me afraid. Not for my life, but for that $250 fine I'm gonna get hit with for sleeping outside.
I lay there, frozen in terror. The shuffling stopped.

They weren't using a flashlight. They were just aimlessly walking all the way out here in the middle of nowhere. Right near my camp, at 9pm on a weekend, alone...
Actually that sounds like nothing any sane person would be doing.
Then I remembered that this town was a battlefield in the Civil War. Not too far fetched to say there was a good chance these woods are a bit haunted.

The footsteps stopped as soon as they had began. Never heard them drift off as they moved away. Never heard them crescendo closer. Just stopped. Clearly, and very distinctly... human.

Then I fell asleep. Woke up, rain coming down. Tarp lean to held just fine. I was dry, using just my shower liner and cardboard as a bed mat under the tarp.
All was well.

Smoked. Walked the mile bck to caseys and stood there. By now it was Sunday if I remember right. Lady came back at 9am. Dude, she brought me so many clothes. I was overwhelmed to say the least. I was expecting a pair of shoes.

She really blew me away. I Thanked her so much, and spent an hour sorting through what I could take and what I couldn't.

I left what I couldn't carry near a donation box, told the universe I was sorry, it's not me being disrespectful, but I literally cannot physically carry all of this. I felt so bad leaving it behind.

I did my clothes at the laundromat, lightened my gear even more by getting rid of everything but what I use daily, and decided Monday i was hitting up the food bank.

So that's what I did. Got enough food, and bought some prior for the 37 mile walk to Hopkinsville... God I am dredding it. Considered a kick scooter as something light weight to bomb hills with, or get a skateboard. I do not want to walk that way so I'm sitting here trying to figure out what to do.

I'm getting the urge to bounce. Been here too many days. I'm healed up, got my food for the trip, but I only have $4 to my name.

How do I make money? I'm unsure. It's always come to me when I needed it.

1imfiz8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1imfiz8,ACER warranty is a SCAM,"So I sent in my laptop to be repaired because it overheated after 3 months of normal use. The tech determined there was a liquid spill that caused damage, I was completely shocked as I’ve babied this laptop and I work in IT so I know how to treat electronics. The laptop was never even on the same desk as liquid that could be spilled. They sent a picture which looks like something brown and sticky which further confuses me because it almost looks like soda or coffee which I would have definitely remembered. This “voided” my warranty and they sent the laptop back. I open it up myself and find the following

1. It’s on the bottom side of the board so it would have had to have been spilled on the laptop while it was upside down

2. There’s no indication anything came through the vents in the casing

3. The picture is very zoomed in and this residue covers maybe a centimeter or two of an area

4. The residue is incredibly sticky and not something that was ever edible, more like an oil or a resin

5. The spot that had residue wasn’t even directly under a vent on the casing (there’s no way whatever it was came from the outside)

6. There’s no indication that this residue damaged the board

7. An alcohol wipe couldn’t even completely clean the tool I used to scrape the resin because of how sticky and oily it was

So my guess is that the tech did it themselves to void the warranty or it’s a manufacturing error and they use anything they can to blame me for negligence even though there’s zero evidence this residue came from outside the laptop. I called Acer back to see If there was a process to fix this issue and there isn’t, they don’t care about my proof or what I found. I’m thinking about litigation bc $1300 is a lot to waste for 3 months of using a laptop. If anybody has any tips or anything helpful please comment. ",1,1739217745.0,AcerOfficial,0,1.0,False

Having said that, these are some top line tips that will be easy to implement and will rebound HUGELY to your benefit on the mountain. 

STUFF TO PACK

-Take at least one pair of socks and underwear for each day of your trek, and then another one for redundancy. It is NOT FUN to have to put on wet, smelly socks at 6am in the morning when it’s 35 degrees. 
-Sanitary Wipes. Take enough so that you have at least two per day, preferably more. It will make a HUGE difference to your comfort level to feel clean and not (terribly) smelly. 
-Cordyceps Mushrooms. These aid adaptation to altitude enormously without the side effects that you get from Diamox. In fact, I didn’t even have to take Diamox at all, partially because of the cordyceps. 

FOOD 

-I LOVED the Four Sigmatic instant matcha and coffee packs. Your trekking company will probably provide you with hot water each meal, which you can use for these. Great for clean energy, taste great, and with Four Sigmatic you’re getting quality ingredients. 
-Dehydrated quinoa/lentil/veggie mixes. Loads of options on Amazon. Food is fuel, ESPECIALLY when you’re burning 5,000 calories per day. Being that there is no way to guarantee the quality of the food your trekking company will be making for you (no shade, I’m just super picky about ingredient quality), taking all of your own food will cover your bases. Simply use the hot water the trekking company provides to add to the dehydrated whatever it is. 
-GU energy packs. These bad boys have carbs, electrolytes, and caffeine and you’ll be able to carry several in your pocket and suck them down when needed, just like marathon runners do. I typically use 2-3 per day on an all day hike. Search “GU espresso love,” take as many as you can. Thank me later. 

TRAINING 

Training is the biggest and most important topic that I may write more about in future, but one thing I’ll say here is that you will put yourself at a HUGE advantage by making time to spend a few days to a week at elevation in the US before embarking on the trip proper. The easiest option is probably to go to Denver or Boulder for a week of hiking and training. Acclimatize ahead of time, because failing to prepare is preparing to fail.

I wasn’t expecting much—just wanted to see if it could actually do what it claimed. Spoiler alert: it blew my mind.

It started with a selfie I wasn’t particularly proud of (you know, one of those ""I-just-woke-up-but-need-coffee"" photos). I stumbled upon this feature called [**AI Avatar Generator**](https://magicshot.ai/features/ai-avatar-generator/), and curiosity got the best of me. The process was ridiculously simple:

1. Uploaded the selfie (don’t worry, it doesn’t judge your morning face).
2. Chose a style—anime, cyberpunk, fantasy—you name it.
3. Clicked the button.

And then… BAM! It transformed my regular photo into this *jaw-dropping* AI avatar that I honestly didn’t believe came from that selfie. It was like seeing myself in a whole new world. The cyberpunk one? Absolute chef’s kiss.

What’s even better is the way the AI pays attention to little details. It’s not just slapping a filter on your face; it genuinely creates something unique. And yeah, I may have shared the avatar in a few group chats to soak up some compliments. 😅

Now, why am I sharing this? Honestly, I feel like tools like [MagicShot.ai](http://MagicShot.ai) fit so well into what we’re doing here—exploring the creative potential of AI. Whether you’re making art for fun or experimenting with workflows, these tools feel like they open up new possibilities. It’s not about the tool being “better” or “worse,” but just another way to spark creativity.

Would love to hear your thoughts if you’ve tried something similar or experimented with turning your selfies into avatars!

It started with a selfie I wasn’t particularly proud of (you know, one of those ""I-just-woke-up-but-need-coffee"" photos). I stumbled upon this feature called [**AI Avatar Generator**](https://magicshot.ai/features/ai-avatar-generator/), and curiosity got the best of me. The process was ridiculously simple:

1. Uploaded the selfie (don’t worry, it doesn’t judge your morning face).
2. Chose a style—anime, cyberpunk, fantasy—you name it.
3. Clicked the button.

And then… BAM! It transformed my regular photo into this *jaw-dropping* AI avatar that I honestly didn’t believe came from that selfie. It was like seeing myself in a whole new world. The cyberpunk one? Absolute chef’s kiss.

What’s even better is the way the AI pays attention to little details. It’s not just slapping a filter on your face; it genuinely creates something unique. And yeah, I may have shared the avatar in a few group chats to soak up some compliments. 😅

Now, why am I sharing this? Honestly, I feel like tools like [MagicShot.ai](http://MagicShot.ai) fit so well into what we’re doing here—exploring the creative potential of AI.

1imfcw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TastefulCoffee/comments/1imfcw6/black_decker_cbg110sc_review_a_compact_grinder/,Black & Decker CBG110SC review: a compact grinder for coffee and spices,"The Black & Decker CBG110SC Easy Touch Electric Smartgrind Coffee & Spice Grinder has been a surprising addition to my kitchen arsenal. As someone who grinds coffee beans daily and occasionally dabbles in spice mixtures, I’ve had my fair share of experiences with grinders, both good and bad. This compact model, with its sleek black finish and stainless steel components, has been a reliable companion, although it does come with its quirks.

The design immediately caught my eye. It’s small and lightweight, making it perfect for kitchens with limited counter space. The glossy black exterior combined with the stainless steel grinding bowl exudes a modern aesthetic that blends well with my other appliances. Despite its size, it feels durable in hand. The lid-locking security feature is a thoughtful addition, ensuring there’s no accidental mess during operation. However, I’ve noticed the lid doesn’t click securely onto the base when wrapping the cord, which can be frustrating during storage.

[Check Black & Decker CBG110SC price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/blackdecker-cbg110sc-grinder-review-b07sz9fft9/)

When it comes to grinding performance, this grinder punches above its weight. The stainless steel blades do an excellent job, producing a surprisingly uniform grind whether it’s coffee beans, spices, or even nuts. For coffee lovers, the grind size leans more towards medium-fine, which works wonderfully for my drip coffee maker. That said, achieving a coarser grind for French press enthusiasts might be a bit of a challenge. As for spices, it handles everything from cinnamon sticks to peppercorns with ease. The grinding process is efficient and takes less than a minute for most tasks, though it’s best not to overload the bowl for optimal results.

The grinder uses a blade mechanism rather than burrs, which is expected at this price point. While burr grinders are known for their precision and consistency, the blade mechanism here is surprisingly effective for its intended use. It’s not the quietest grinder I’ve used, but it’s significantly quieter compared to some louder models that could wake up the entire house. The one-touch pulse control simplifies operation, though it would’ve been nice to have more grind settings for precise customization.

Capacity-wise, the grinder holds enough beans for up to 12 cups of coffee, which is more than sufficient for my needs. The grinding speed is impressive—quick and efficient without overheating the beans or spices. I particularly appreciate the removable grinding container lid, which makes cleaning a breeze. However, the lack of a cord storage compartment is a minor inconvenience, especially if you’re someone like me who prefers a tidy counter.

**Pros**

1. Compact and lightweight design, perfect for small kitchens.
2. Stainless steel blades and grinding bowl ensure durability.
3. Versatile usage—grinds coffee beans, spices, nuts, and more.
4. One-touch pulse control simplifies operation.
5. Budget-friendly option with decent performance.

**Cons**

1. Lid doesn’t securely attach when winding the cord.
2. Limited grind size options, making it less ideal for French press users.
3. Noisy compared to some high-end models.
4. Cord storage could be better thought out.
5. Blade mechanism impacts grind consistency compared to burr grinders.

Comparing this grinder to its competitors reveals some interesting insights. Models like the Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill offer more grind size options and burr mechanisms for coffee enthusiasts. However, they come at nearly double the price and take up more counter space. On the other hand, the KRUPS GX4100 Electric Spice and Coffee Grinder is another great alternative with similar versatility, though it lacks the modern aesthetics and stainless steel components of the Black & Decker. What sets the Black & Decker apart is its balance of affordability, compactness, and multipurpose functionality.

Analyzing the cost, this grinder is undeniably good value for money. It’s not intended to compete with high-end burr grinders but instead caters to those seeking a reliable, budget-friendly option for everyday use. While it has its flaws, the performance and versatility make it a worthwhile investment, especially for casual coffee drinkers and home cooks experimenting with spices.

The features of this grinder are straightforward yet effective. From the push-button control to the removable lid and non-slip rubber feet, everything serves a purpose. Its ability to grind multiple ingredients without cross-contamination is especially useful when switching between coffee beans and spices. Moreover, the lightweight design makes it easy to move around or store away when not in use.

1imfa7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1imfa7y/what_is_your_gerd_story/,What is your GERD story?,"Just genuinely curious how everyone is doing. How did your GERD start and where are you at now? 

This is my story: 

I’m 32F. Normal weight, don’t smoke or drink (used to a long time ago), eat well and try to stay active. 

My GERD first started when I was about 21. Looking back, it probably started sooner and actually I’ve since been told that I had terrible reflux as a baby and child. So, my digestive system clearly hasn’t been great since birth lol. 

I went on PPIs aged 22. This controlled my symptoms for many years. I went to uni, drank/smoke and ate like shit, like you do. Still, my GERD was mostly fine. I got a lot of burping and regurgitation but that was kind of it. I had a gastroscopy for the first time in 2017 which showed mild gastritis. I had another in 2021 which showed the same. 

In around summer 2023, my symptoms got bad for no obvious reason and I started feeling like I had a lump in my throat all the time. I saw a gastro doctor privately who switched me from lansoprazole to esomeprazole and gave me some lifestyle advice. I started paying real attention to my diet and along with the switch in meds, it got a lot better again. 

Until… Fast forward to Feb 2024, I fell pregnant with my first baby. All was actually fine until around week 16 of pregnancy when I started with awful acid reflux and heartburn. Saw my GP and then gastro again who bumped up my esomeprazole to 20mg twice daily + famotidine 20mg twice daily. My reflux got worse and worse during the pregnancy and by the end I was on 40mg of both twice daily + sucrulfate 1g 4 times daily. 

When my baby was born in October, I had about 3/4 glorious weeks where my GERD seemed to just disappear. Maybe I was tired and delusional, haha. Stupidly I ate like shit during this time (trying to keep awake) - so much chocolate, coffee etc. 

Since November, I’ve been in a bad way. Constant reflux, also had some heartburn and acid again, constant regurgitation and feeling like there’s a lump again. I had another gastroscopy and colonoscopy in December which was clear. The next step for me now is a CT scan, pH testing and manometry testing. I’m unsure how long I’ll have to wait for all of that as I’ve only just been referred for the tests. I hope it’s soon. 

So… Here we are now. My GP has switched me back to lansoprazole to see if that’ll make a difference. I’m also trying EXTREMELY hard with my diet and I’m just eating super plain stuff in small amounts. I still have bad reflux regardless and I’ve dropped a lot of weight since my baby was born, to the point I’m well under my pre-pregnancy weight. It’s awful and I hope there’s some help ahead. I don’t know what the next step will be for me, maybe even surgery eventually I guess. Or maybe my issue is something else, gallbladder or some other digestive complaint, who knows. 

If you made it this far, thanks lol. Sometimes it just feels good to get it out. Living with GERD is really miserable and I think people don’t get it unless they live with severe GERD. For me, it’s not just ‘oh, pop a couple of antacids after your coffee and you’ll be fine’. I wish. Sigh. ",2,1739217208.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

# How to Make a Friend: The Research Shows…

by Beverley Fehr

|| || ||

Recently my friend Lisa, a 40-year old woman, was forced to move when the company in which she had a senior executive position announced it was relocating its headquarters to a new city. Without much time to think about it, Lisa packed her belongings and shipped them to her new destination.

When she arrived, she was told that the company was renovating the building it had purchased and that it had leased several small spaces to serve as temporary offices until the renovation was complete. Hoping to make new friends, Lisa was disappointed to discover that there were only two other employees in her temporary space. Both had grown up in the area and had well-established friendship and family networks.

Lisa turned to me, a social psychologist who has done research on friendship for decades, and asked, “How do I go about making friends in this new environment?”

# Courting Friendship

Lisa’s question is one that many people have asked, particularly when going through life transitions such as moving to a new place, deciding to be a “stay at home” parent, or retiring from a long-time job, to name just a few. Obviously, there isn’t a single, correct “one fits all” formula. Yet the lessons learned from research on friendships can be helpful navigating what can be a rather daunting journey.

Let’s start from the “outside” and work our way in.

*1. Put yourself in situations that are conducive to friendship formation.*

A classic study of friendship formation among people living in married student housing on a university campus found that people were most likely to form friendships with residents who lived one door down, followed by those who lived two doors down, and so on. Other research confirms that we are most likely to form friendships with people who are in close physical proximity to us—the person whose office is next to ours, the student who sits beside us in class.

A good start is to acknowledge that person with a friendly smile or a “Good morning.” Some apartment complexes or neighborhoods offer structured activities for residents, such as barbecues and neighborhood block parties. This is more common in cities that have large numbers of people moving in. Although it may not be in your comfort zone to attend a social event with a group of strangers, it can be helpful to take advantage of the proximity. Who knows? The neighbor next door may become your new best friend!

This brings us to a related predictor of friendship formation, namely familiarity. We are most likely to develop friendships with people whom we rub shoulders on a frequent basis (which is why people often become friends with co-workers).

In Lisa’s case, the current office situation wasn’t ideal for getting to know a lot of work colleagues. If you are in a similar situation, look for other opportunities that will allow you to cross paths with the same people on a frequent basis. For example, if you go to the same coffee shop at the same time every day, before long you will find yourself making small talk with the other regulars. These casual interactions can be stepping-stones toward long-term friendships. As clichéd as it sounds, you also may want to join an exercise class or hiking group or cooking class. Any activity in which you have regular, frequent contact with others increases your chances of forming friendships.

*2. Find people whose interests, attitudes, and values are similar to yours.*

According to the old adage, opposites attract. But decades of research show that we are most likely to form friendships with people who are similar to us. (Similarity is also the key to sustaining friendships once they have been formed.)

If you have moved to a city or town where there is a yoga studio on every corner, you might be wondering if you will meet more potential friends if you sign up for a yoga class than a cooking class. If, however, you would rather have a root canal than get into yoga wear, and cooking is your passion, you are wise to seek out other foodies. You may be accessing a smaller pool of friendship candidates in the cooking class, but chances are, the people you’ll meet there share your interests and passion. And that’s important.

Early research in social psychology showed that we are likely to be attracted to, and form long-term friendships with, people who share our attitudes and values. Indeed, if you are a life-long Democrat, chances are that you will not see eye-to-eye with a Trump supporter on many issues. Although spending time with your opposite might make for stimulating conversation, in the long run, relationships of all kinds work better when people are on the same page in terms of their core values and attitudes.

Subsequent research has shown that it is also important to match up in terms of leisure preferences.

When you get together with friends, it is usually to do something, whether that involves going out for a drink, seeing a movie, or watching a baseball game. If a potential friend only watches horror movies and you hate being terrified, it may be challenging to figure out what you can do on a Friday night that both of you will enjoy. Similarly, if you love downhill skiing and love to slip away for ski weekends, while your new friend hates any kind of outdoor winter activity, it will be more difficult to coordinate spending time together.

*3. Don’t be afraid to make the first move.*

Let’s face it. It can feel awkward or even nerve-wracking to ask a potential friend to go out for coffee or for a drink. There is always vulnerability involved in making these kinds of overtures (regardless of whether we are talking about forming friendships or romantic relationships). Rejection is painful, even when we don’t have much on the line. It isn’t surprising, therefore, that most people are anxious about making the first move.

Perhaps you have been enjoying your conversations with that person you see in the coffee shop and would like to get to know him or her better. But you might hold back from initiating anything because this person hasn’t made a “first move.” Obviously, that means he or she isn’t interesting in hanging out with you outside of the coffee shop. Right?

Actually, wrong!

Research shows that we don’t take into account another possibility—the one that is generally closer to the truth, namely that that the other person might actually want to get to know us better but is afraid we might reject him or her! In other words, the real reason is often that the other person is just as worried about rejection as we are. So take a deep breath and ask that potential friend if she or he would be interested in checking out that new diner down the street after work sometime.

*4. Take your time in getting to know someone.*

We’ve all had that experience of the stranger on the airplane who “reveals all.” Although we may find the person’s story interesting or feel sympathy for the hard knocks she or he has experienced, we generally aren’t keen on maintaining contact once the flight is over.

Revealing too much, too soon can sabotage any relationship before it gets off the ground. So what should we do?

According to theories of relationship development, getting to know someone is like unpeeling layers of an onion. First, you begin by revealing more superficial information about yourself (for example, where you are from, why you have moved to this new place). You then wait to see what the other person does. Does she or he seem to respond appropriately? Does the person reciprocate and tell you something about himself or herself? If you don’t see any red flags, you might then reveal a little more about yourself. Social psychologists refer to this as increasing the breadth and depth of self-disclosures. In other words, you still are revealing relatively superficial information but are covering a wider range of topics, such as your hobbies and interests, how many siblings you have, and so on.

The point of this gradual process of unpeeling of the onion is to be able to gauge, at each step, how the other person responds and whether the other person reciprocates your disclosures. This is critical to establishing trust.

Revealing personal and intimate information about ourselves is a vulnerable process, and it is important to feel assured that the other person can be trusted. You might not want everyone in your new office (especially if you are the boss) to know that you once threw up on your date and were too embarrassed to offer to pay for the dry-cleaning bill. You also might not want everyone at the company board meeting to know that you are still grieving the death of your mother, thanks to a new work friend’s tendency to “overshare.”

When you engage in gradual, reciprocal disclosure, there is less chance that you will end up feeling hurt or betrayed by a new friend.

*5. Be responsive and show interest.*

Back in 1936, Dale Carnegie, motivational lecturer and author, published a bestselling book called *How to Win Friends and Influence People*. One of his famous quotations was this: “You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.”

Social psychologists have conducted experiments on what has become known as the *Carnegie effect*. Generally in these experiments, a research participant is brought into the lab to have a “getting acquainted” conversation with another person. This person is introduced as another participant in the experiment but is actually someone hired by the researchers (referred to as a confederate). The confederate is trained to behave either responsively (by head nodding, showing an interest in what the participant is saying, making eye contact) or unresponsively (making little eye contact, looking bored). The findings are clear: People like the confederate much more when she or he behaves in a responsive manner than when she or he is a nonresponsive listener. Participants also express greater willingness to get together with the confederate again when she or he has been responsive.

So, although it can be tempting to focus on ourselves in conversations, it truly is the case that we are much more likely to make friends when we show interest in the other person.

Finally, it is important to note that responsiveness also extends beyond face-to-face conversations. If a potential friend texts you or sends an email, responding in a timely manner will convey that she or he matters to you and that you are interested in maintaining contact.

# Why Bother?

There is no getting around the fact that it usually takes time, effort, and vulnerability to form new friendships. There may be times when you wonder if it is worth it. We all do. But it is important to keep in mind that more and more research is being done these days on the benefits of friendship. It comes as no surprise to learn that people with close friendships are less lonely. It turns out, however, that people with close friendships actually are in better physical health and better emotional and mental health. Psychologists used to think that these were the benefits that came just with being married. We are now beginning to realize that these positive outcomes are not unique to marriage but rather that friendships are really important for our overall well-being.

So if you find yourself in a position where you need a new friend, don’t hold back. The person you will create a relationship with needs a friend as much as you do.

1imf039,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_uadvmedia/comments/1imf039/campbell_soup_name_change_explained_what/,Campbell Soup Name Change Explained: What Businesses Can Learn from the Rebrand,"For generations, Campbell Soup has been a name that brings to mind warm, comforting meals shared around the table. But even cherished traditions can grow to reflect the times. In a thoughtful move, Campbell Soup has announced it’s dropping “Soup” from its name, becoming The Campbell’s Company. This Campbell Soup name change isn’t about leaving soup behind—it’s about making room for the brand’s growing portfolio, which includes snacks, sauces, and pantry staples that have become just as beloved. 

What can businesses take away from this carefully considered rebrand? Let’s explore the Campbell Soup market strategy and find out how you can navigate your own rebranding journeys.

# Why Did Campbell Soup Change Its Name?

When a name carries over 155 years of history, every decision around it carries weight. So, why did Campbell change its name? For Campbell’s, the choice to rebrand reflects its evolution from a company known for soup to a versatile food brand with a range of products like Goldfish crackers, Prego sauces, and V8 juices. While soup will always be part of its heart, the company is looking ahead to embrace a broader future.

The Campbell Soup name change isn’t the first time a brand has reimagined its name to align with growth. Dunkin’ dropped “Donuts” to reflect its broader menu, and Starbucks removed “Coffee” to highlight its growing offerings. These shifts show how simplifying a name can help brands connect with new audiences without losing their identity.

We believe a name change isn’t just a rebranding—it’s a strategic shift. It becomes necessary when your current name no longer reflects your offerings, limits audience perception, or creates barriers to growth. 

# Modernizing For A New Consumer Base

Today’s consumers are looking for more than just familiar products—they want variety, convenience, and options that fit into their lives. Younger generations, in particular, are seeking out brands that feel fresh and relevant. Campbell’s recognized this and responded by diversifying its portfolio with products that range from premium sauces like Rao’s to everyday pantry staples like Pace salsa.

CEO Mark Clouse described the change as a “subtle but important” step, reflecting the company’s focus on long-term growth while staying true to its roots. By shifting its name, Campbell’s creates space to grow in a way that keeps its legacy intact, much like its iconic red-and-white labels that remain on shelves today.

 Modernizing your brand doesn’t mean losing the elements people love about it—it’s about expanding on those connections. We help brands evolve thoughtfully, ensuring every step feels true to who you are.

# What Is The New Name For Campbell Soup?

Campbell Soup has officially dropped ""Soup"" from its name, transitioning to The Campbell’s Company. This subtle yet powerful change reflects the company’s commitment to staying relevant in a rapidly evolving market while embracing the full breadth of its expanding portfolio. 

The name change signals that Campbell’s is no longer just about soup; it's about a wide array of food products that cater to today’s diverse consumer tastes—from snacks and sauces to beverages and beyond.

But a name change isn’t just about the words; it’s also about how the company presents itself visually.

# Logo And Visual Identity Refresh

Alongside the name change, there was a Campbell Soup logo update to modernize its identity. The new logo embraces simplicity, with a clean and contemporary font and updated color palette that keeps the essence of the old but feels more in line with modern branding trends. The red—traditionally associated with Campbell’s—remains dominant, evoking the warmth and comfort the brand has always stood for.

The updated design highlights the company’s shift toward a broader food range while retaining its familiar visual identity. The Campbell logo redesign fits neatly into the trend of minimalist logos that allow brands to feel fresh without abandoning their roots.

A well-executed rebrand is about balancing heritage with innovation. While Campbell’s has made visual updates, they have carefully preserved elements that carry significant brand equity—like the signature red and white color scheme—while introducing contemporary design elements that signal the company’s forward-thinking approach.

# A Balancing Act: Innovation And Heritage

For a brand as iconic as Campbell’s, finding the balance between nostalgia and modern appeal is key. The impact of Campbell Soup's name change was profound and it has successfully kept the comforting, familiar aspects of Campbell’s identity intact—while introducing new elements to make the brand feel fresh and relevant. 

This allows the company to maintain its connection with long-time consumers while also attracting younger audiences who might be seeking more innovative and diverse food options.

The strategy here is clear: evolve without losing the emotional connection that makes the brand a household name. This balance is essential, as it ensures that the brand remains both timeless and timely.

Striking the right balance between innovation and heritage is an art form. Businesses can stay relevant to modern consumers while honoring the history that made them successful in the first place. A rebrand that acknowledges the past and prepares for the future allows a company to grow without sacrificing its core identity.

# The History Of Campbell Soup: A Brand Legacy

Campbell Soup has a rich history, with more than 155 years of providing comforting, iconic products. From its humble beginnings as a small soup company to becoming a global leader in the food industry, Campbell’s has remained a cornerstone of many households. But even the most established brands must evolve to stay competitive, and this name change is a testament to the company’s ability to adapt to a changing marketplace.

# From Origins To Iconic Branding

In 1869, Campbell Soup started with just a handful of employees and a focus on canned soup. Over the decades, the company’s growth and innovation allowed it to dominate the American food market. But Campbell Soup’s influence didn’t stop at the kitchen table—it also reached popular culture.

In the 1960s, the brand became synonymous with pop art thanks to Andy Warhol’s iconic *Campbell’s Soup Cans* series. Warhol's work immortalized the brand, capturing the essence of American consumerism and bringing Campbell’s into the modern art world. His piece is now considered one of the most famous examples of pop art and solidified Campbell’s as a cultural icon, forever intertwining the brand with both food and art.

Today, as Campbell’s looks to the future, it continues to build on this legacy while adapting to the modern world. The new name is just the next chapter in a history of continuous reinvention.

A successful rebrand builds on a brand’s history, celebrating its legacy while positioning it for future growth. For Campbell’s, the name change preserves its rich heritage while opening doors to new possibilities.

# Why Rebranding Matters For Legacy Brands

Even the most iconic brands must evolve to stay relevant in today’s fast-paced market. For legacy brands like Campbell’s, rebranding is about more than a name change—it’s about aligning with consumer expectations, addressing market trends, and preparing for future growth.

Rebranding allows companies to shed outdated perceptions while retaining the elements that resonate with their audience. Take Dunkin’, for example. Dropping “Donuts” from its name allowed the brand to signal its pivot to a broader range of offerings, from coffee to on-the-go meals. Similarly, Old Spice revitalized its image with bold advertising and a modern visual identity, transforming from “your grandfather’s cologne” to a leading men’s grooming brand.

Rebranding is a powerful tool for legacy brands to stay competitive, but it must be executed with care. A thoughtful rebrand respects the brand’s heritage while appealing to a new generation of consumers, ensuring a seamless transition that builds trust and excitement.

# The Impact Of Campbell Soup’s Name Change

Campbell’s decision to rebrand as The Campbell’s Company sends ripples far beyond the company itself. It highlights the growing need for businesses to adapt to shifting consumer demands, diversify their offerings, and modernize their branding.

# How Consumers Are Reacting

Initial reactions to the Campbell Soup rebrand have been mixed, as is often the case with iconic brands. Long-time customers appreciate the company’s respect for its heritage, while younger audiences view the change as a smart move toward relevance. Press and media coverage have highlighted the thoughtful balance Campbell’s achieved—keeping its core identity intact while expanding its appeal.

UADV’s Insight: Gathering and analyzing early feedback is a crucial part of any rebranding strategy. Listening to how customers and stakeholders respond helps businesses fine-tune their messaging, ensuring the rebrand resonates across key audiences.

# Lessons For Competing Brands

The Campbell Soup name change underscores the importance of understanding market positioning and consumer insights. Legacy brands often face the challenge of remaining relevant in a world where consumer preferences are constantly evolving. Companies that fail to adapt—such as Sears and Blockbuster—serve as cautionary tales of what happens when a brand remains stagnant.

Successful rebrands require careful planning, strong consumer insights, and strategic implementation. At UADV, we use proven tools and frameworks to guide businesses through every step of the rebranding process, from research to execution.

# Lessons From Campbell Soup’s Rebranding Strategy

Campbell’s rebrand provides valuable insights for businesses navigating their own transformation. Here are actionable takeaways to consider:

1. **Honor Your Heritage**: Build on what your brand stands for, but don’t be afraid to evolve. Campbell’s retained its iconic elements while updating its name to reflect its modern identity.
2. **Stay Consumer-Centric**: Align your brand with the values and needs of your audience. Campbell’s recognized shifting preferences for variety, convenience, and health and adapted accordingly.
3. **Simplify for Flexibility**: A name or logo shouldn’t restrict your business. By dropping “Soup,” Campbell’s created a name that can stretch across diverse product categories.
4. **Test and Refine**: Early feedback is key to gauging the success of your rebrand. Use consumer insights to adjust and optimize your strategy post-launch.

Whether you’re a legacy brand or a startup, rebranding is an opportunity to redefine your place in the market. At UADV, we specialize in helping businesses create strategies that balance innovation and heritage, ensuring long-term success. Let’s transform your brand into a story of growth and possibility.

# Understanding When It’s Time To Rebrand

Rebranding is a significant step, and timing is everything. For many businesses, the decision to rebrand stems from clear signals, such as declining market relevance, evolving consumer demographics, or the need to enter new markets. For Campbell’s, the flat growth of its soup category, alongside the rising popularity of its snacks and sauces, signaled the need for change.

Brands like Campbell’s demonstrate how rebranding can be a proactive measure to stay ahead of market trends and reposition for future growth. Ignoring these signs can leave brands struggling to connect with their audience, as seen in the declines of once-iconic names like Sears and Blockbuster.

# Aligning Rebrands With Consumer Insights

At the heart of every successful rebrand lies a deep understanding of the consumer. Campbell’s decision to update its name and visual identity was driven by research into shifting consumer preferences for variety, convenience, and modern branding. By aligning its strategy with these insights, Campbell’s ensured its rebrand resonated with both loyal customers and new audiences.

Rebranding decisions should never be made in isolation. Our team can leverage market research and consumer behavior analysis to create data-driven strategies that align with your audience’s evolving needs. Our approach ensures your rebrand feels both authentic and impactful.

# The Importance Of Consistency Across Channels

One of the best elements of Campbell’s rebrand is its consistency. The updated name and visual identity seamlessly extend across its products, packaging, and messaging, ensuring a cohesive experience for consumers. This consistency reinforces trust and familiarity while highlighting the brand’s evolution.

Consistency is key in any rebranding effort. Our tip is for businesses to implement cohesive visual and verbal branding strategies that resonate across every touchpoint—from logos and packaging to advertising and social media.

# Marketing Implications Of Rebranding

A rebrand brings with it a host of marketing considerations that can shape how well the new identity resonates with your audience. One of the most critical areas is search engine optimization (SEO). Changes to a brand’s name, logo, or domain can significantly impact organic search rankings if not handled carefully. Redirects from the old site to the new one, updating metadata, and informing search engines of the transition are essential steps to maintain visibility and prevent traffic loss.

Rebranding also affects content strategy. The new identity might require refreshing existing materials to align with updated messaging and visuals. Social media handles, ad creatives, and email templates need a seamless transition to avoid confusing your audience.

Moreover, rebranding offers an opportunity to re-engage with customers and stakeholders. A marketing campaign to introduce the rebrand can boost awareness and generate excitement. By emphasizing the reasons behind the change and how it benefits the audience, businesses can turn the rebranding process into a moment of renewed connection.

Rebranding will influence how customers view your brand. A fresh identity may spark curiosity, but it can also lead to questions, skepticism, or even resistance, especially from loyal customers. Having aclear strategy to address customer concerns is essential. 

This includes proactively communicating the reasons for the rebrand, how it aligns with customer values, and what remains consistent about the brand. Monitoring customer feedback and reviews during this period ensures that any misunderstandings or frustrations are addressed quickly, helping to preserve trust and loyalty.

Ignoring these marketing implications risks eroding trust, losing web traffic, or creating confusion among loyal customers. With a comprehensive marketing strategy, however, rebranding becomes a chance to elevate the brand’s presence and future-proof its market position.

# Final Thoughts 

Campbell’s rebranding from “Campbell Soup” to The Campbell’s Company is a masterclass in balancing legacy with modernity. It demonstrates the importance of listening to your audience, adapting to market changes, and staying consistent in your messaging.

As businesses navigate today’s fast-paced market, rebranding becomes an essential tool for staying relevant and competitive. Whether it’s to reflect a growing portfolio, attract new demographics, or signal a shift in strategy, rebranding allows companies to evolve without losing sight of their identity.

Today I was awoken by Damsel.

Damsel: ""Flynn, wake up!""  
Me: ""What's the matter?""  
Damsel: ""Look outside!""

I did as she wanted and looked out the window.  
The forest was filled with snow, trees were white, but it was also very sunny, the sunlight bounced off the snow, lighting every single crevice of the woods.  
It was pretty.

Damsel: ""Can we go outside? It's so pretty!""

Damsel had recently recovered from a powerful illness, and her immune system is weakened. Under normal circumstances, I'd tell her that we should stay inside, but how could I ever refuse her? Especially when she's so happy?

Me: ""Of course, sweetheart. We can go.""  
Damsel: ""Yippie!""

Before we went, we both had breakfast with a cup of coffee. Afterwards, I made her put on every warm piece of clothing - gloves, hat, scarf, you name it. All for the sake of keeping her warm and dry. It would be a real shame if she got sick again.

Before we stepped out through the front door, I put Prisoner in charge while I'm gone, and I took some food with us. We were going to be outside for a while.  
Once we went outside Damsel took my hand and pulled me into the woods along with her.

Damsel: ""Come on! Faster! Let's go!""  
Me: ""I'm going!""

Hm, now that I think about it. I can imagine how unusual this would look from the side - a giant armoured man being pulled into the forest by a beautiful princess.  
To think that I used to be called a Hellwalker, an Unchained Predator, a Scourge of Hell... It's crazy how people can change for the people they love...  
She has no idea of who I truly am, or what I've done in the past, and honestly... I'd prefer to keep it that way...

It was -3°C, so the snow and ice wasn't melting.  
Damsel once stepped on a frozen puddle, which was covered in a thin layer of snow. She slipped and nearly fell, but I caught her.  
I too stepped on that puddle, but my boots have spikes, so I didn't slip.

At some point, Damsel let go of my hand.

Damsel: ""Catch me if you can!""

She then ran off into the woods, and I ran after her.  
I wasn't running at full speed, mainly because it wouldn't be interesting if I simply caught her. As she was running, she occasionally looked back at me to see how close I was, and she would giggle every time she did. As I was running, I noticed that the sheer weight being slammed down every time I took a step caused the snow on nearby trees to fall.  
I'm a big lad.

Despite my immense size, I felt like a little boy playing catch.  
We played for hours, and seemingly in that moment, all my problems seemed to vanish. For the first time in a very long time, I felt burdenless, I felt young again.

At some point, Damsel ran onto a frozen lake. The surface covered in a thick layer of snow, so Damsel could still run on it. As I ran after her, I heard the ice start to crack.  
I fell through the ice and into the cold water.

As I resurfaced, I saw Damsel come towards me with concern and fear in her eyes.

Damsel: ""Oh no! Flynn!""  
Me: ""Get away from the edge of the ice! You'll fall in too!""

As Damsel watched in fear for me, I crawled onto the nearby ice, but it too broke off under my weight. I kept crawling on the ice, until I finally managed to get to the surface of the lake.

Damsel: ""You're soaked! You have to get warm!""  
Me: ""I'm dry. The suit, however...""

I believed the suit to be waterproof, but, apparently, after years of wear, the suit had small holes.  
I wasn't in any real danger, there was still the undersuit, which kept me dry and warm, however, the same can't be said about the suit's electronics, which had been exposed to water and got damaged.

Damsel: ""I think we need to go back...""  
Me: ""Yeah, I agree.""  
Damsel: ""Uhm... but which way do we go?""  
Me: ""Oh... fuck...""  
Damsel: ""Flynn! Language!""  
Me: ""Sorry, dear! I... I have no idea... Wait, let me try...""

I tried to activate the suit's navigational systems, but those are one of the systems that got damaged.

Me: ""Oh no... Damsel... I think we're lost...""  
Damsel: ""Oh no! What do we do?! The sun is setting! It's starting to get dark!""  
Me: ""Alright, stay calm! I'll think of something...""

I tried to open a portal, but the remote portal control systems were also damaged.

Me: ""DAMNIT! Uh... We can... Uhm... Maybe we should follow our footprints?""  
Damsel: ""Yeah! You're smart! Let's do that!""  
Me: ""Where are our footprints?""  
Damsel: ""Oh... I... I don't know...""

It suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, it began to snow heavily. Even if we did find our footprints, our chances of getting back by following them just turned nonexistent.

Damsel: ""Flynn... I'm scared...""  
Me: ""Don't worry, sweetie! We'll get back in one piece! I promise!""

It was quickly turning dark, and temperatures rapidly dropped to a whopping -20°C.  
It was clear that we had to find shelter, any shelter.

Me: ""We're not getting back today...""  
Damsel: ""WHAT?! But... Where are we going to sleep?!""  
Me: ""Well... we have to start looking for shelter...""

We spent a lot of time looking for a place fit for sleep, but to no avail. The woods at night were very harsh towards us. At some point, Damsel started getting cold, so we could no longer keep walking.

We found a fairly spacious cave. We decided to stay there. It is a cave, but do we have a better option?

I managed to take apart a dead tree with my hands.  
Damsel was shocked when I managed to bring down a tree with a fist, and as I was taking apart the tree for firewood, she started talking about it.

Damsel: ""You're... very strong...""  
Me: ""Yeah, it's... been that way for a while...""  
Damsel: ""I've never seen you work out like Advie, how are you so much stronger?""  
Me: ""I'd... rather not talk about it... sorry...""  
Damsel: ""Okay, whatever you say!""

I made a campfire in the cave. The entrance was large and high enough for the carbon dioxide to escape the cave and for the oxygen to feed the fire.  
Most importantly, the cave shielded us from the blizzard that started outside.

Me: ""Ugh... I'm so sorry that we'll have to sleep in a cave tonight...""  
Damsel: ""Oh, don't be sorry! It was my fault. If I didn't run on the lake, we would be sleeping in our bed tonight...""  
Me: ""No, don't blame yourself. It's my fault that I didn't repair this suit. If I just sealed the damned holes, we wouldn't be sleeping in a cave.""  
Damsel: ""Okay... maybe... maybe we both messed up?""  
Me: ""Well... yeah. I guess we both messed up.""

I then looked away from Damsel to feed the fire some firewood, and as I looked back, I noticed that she was sad.

Me: ""What's the matter, button?""  
Damsel: ""I'm just... I try my best to make our lives as good as possible... but there's always something that goes very wrong...""  
Me: ""Well, bad stuff just happens sometimes. There isn't always a reason for it, but it just happens anyways.""  
Damsel: ""But there's **always** something going wrong... I can't seem to make everybody happy... Everyone always ends up sad again...""  
Me: ""Damsel... let me tell you something...""

I carefully thought about what I'm going to say.

Me: ""You are probably the best person to have appeared in my life. Life has been extremely unfair towards me. Everybody always expects me to know the answer, to have a plan, to win, to achieve, and they're usually not disappointed, but when they are... they **really** are. My world is very grim and dark. It's full of pain, loss, and betrayal. I've suffered for a very long time, and there's just always something that goes wrong.  
But when I found you... I had no idea that someone could be so innocent and kind. You were like a lightbulb in a dark basement that suddenly lit up. A spark that ignited a fire. A rain cloud in a desert. The sunlight you emitted helped me see the good in life. You have no clue how much I changed thanks to you.  
I am so glad that I found you.""

Damsel looked at me with a loving smile. Her sad facial expression had disappeared, as if it was never there in the first place.

Damsel: ""I... I'm... I'm very glad to know how happy I've made you...""  
Me: ""Oh, you know nothing.""

That answer seemed to make her smile even more.

Then, I heard her stomach growl.  
I instantly remembered the food I took with us. The food consisted of two sandwiches and crackers. We can't eat all of the food instantly, because we had no idea how long we were going to be in the woods, so I gave her a sandwich.  
She was about to take a bite, but hesitated. She tore the sandwich in half and gave me one half.  
She manages to make me happy even in dark times such as this. We both ate our halves.

However, happiness was short-lived, as Damsel began shivering.  
To fight the cold, I took off my fur cape and wrapped her in it. Then, to fight it even more, I hugged her and held her like that all night. She questioned how I was going to sleep like that, but I told her that I'll go to sleep shortly after she falls asleep.  
In reality, I stayed up all night. Mainly because there was a risk of a wild animal encounter. What if this cave was some bear's den?

In any case, Damsel slept well tonight.

I needed a replacement, so I bought the same version of ipencil, used, from a local business.

I brought it home, charged it up, and it just works with my ipad without me pairing it!  Is this solid proof that I've recovered my stolen ipencil, sold back to me?  

Or could the pairing have happened automatically when I charged it?  I never unpaired the stolen one.

But then I also found at the sky beach bar option to pay 1050 thb and having free drink? (https://www.skybeachbangkok.com/happenings)
Does this work always? Or is it just during day etc? It says it was promotion only in January but I have read on more sites that it is the case.

And lastly I also found on trip advisor people saying the access costs around 800 thb when buying on the spot? I thought booking in advance is always cheaper than booking on site. Can someone please shed some more light into it? Maybe someone who was there recently?

I think its getting too hot. I only recently started reading about airflow and spent the past weekend cleaning up my PC's internals, moving wires and getting rid of a lot of poor cable management. I currently have 1 intake in the lower front and 1 exhaust in the upper back (plus the powersupply which has an intake down and exhaust in lower back). I have a GTX 980 Ti; and my hot spot temp readings on the GPU is reaching close to 97, with other readings just over 90 during gameplay and between 50 to 60 when idle. The fans are facing a glass wall, and I am thinking about removing the glass panel and replacing with a mesh like this: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BMXN8TX2/ref=ewc\_pr\_img\_2?smid=AH2YJPMCLQC02&th=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BMXN8TX2/ref=ewc_pr_img_2?smid=AH2YJPMCLQC02&th=1)

I upgraded my PSU from a CX750w to a GameMax 850W because I thought my powersupply was starting to die (loud noises & the games crashing). Also, I read that there were two versions of the CX750w made, and I had the poor-quality one.

I recently got OCCT and FanControl to help me make better tuning and I plan to replace the 2 x OEM 1200RPM fans with 3 x 1500RPM fans (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BKKFBR9R/ref=ewc\_pr\_img\_1?smid=A1BCKG4OE2CKC4&th=1). I intend to have 2 intake in the front and 1 exhaust out the back.

The chassis is a BitFenix Prodigy, but I removed the plastic shield on the front to open the front fan to more air. This chassis has no holes on the sides.

1imevjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaleSexualHealth/comments/1imevjt/how_i_stay_hard_after_ejaculation/,How i stay Hard after Ejaculation,"
Yep it's true! I can stay hard after ejaculation.

Some context:
I didn't used to be this way. If fact i was very unhealthy and my erections just weren't all that strong. Plus my cum loads were kinda small. But I turned my life around and got really healthy. Really started getting into supplements too. I noticed my erections were way harder, I had bigger loads and the cherry one top was a very short refactory period. Could be ready to go again within a few minutes. That sent me down a rabbit hole of trial and error to get to the point im at now. 

I now don't get soft after ejaculation if I keep going or with my partner with proper motivation, if you know what I mean :3


So the idea to do to 3 things:

1. Over all sexual mechanical function. Make sure your junk is working 110%. This speeds up semen production too.
2. Increase libido. Should we self explanatory lol
3. Lower your prolactin levels. This was the confusing one. Prolacting is what your body releases when you ejaculate that causes ""post nut clarity""

Here is my current stack:

Zinc = does all 3

L-Citrulline = does 1 and 2 big time!

Black Maca = great replacement for coffee and increases libido

Acetyl-l-carnitine(ALCAR) = extremely nasty tasting but is super important for mental focus and for lowering prolactin

P5P = its basically the pure form of b6 but works well with ALCAR to reduce prolactin and is an energy  booster 

Vitamin D = extremely important for overall sexual health 

Vitamin E =  just started taking this but apparently works well with vitamin d and lecithin

Lecithin =  It's in everyone's stack and help with cum production and even thickens up cum. Drink alot of water to shoot massive loads

I also eat every day = 3 stocks of celery, 100g of carrots, 50g pumpkin seeds, 20g of almonds, 15g brazil nuts, 20g chia seeds. For over all sexual health",1,1739216208.0,MaleSexualHealth,0,1.0,False

Head out to Point Lobos for a morning hike, spend the day sight-seeing

Monday: leisurely morning and then head to San Jose for afternoon flight

Silent reflux/gerd symptoms for six months, continuous and worsening for two.

Began with swollen uvula possibly from caustic substances. Irritated nasopharynx over subsequent three months, spice, coffee, smoke use as possible aggravators.

Current symptoms: 50-70% of the day, heartburn
70%+ of the day, acid saliva regurgitation/acid taste in mouth
Cobblestone mouth, odd gurgling, variable stool, bloating (some)

Demulcents: sodium alginate throughout day, alkaline rinse, DGL liquorice and aloe Vera, herbal teas

Awaiting: endoscopy in June

Think I should get: h pylori test, sibo? GI map test, to check gut imbalance and for infection

Endcosopy: for ulcers, inflammation, damage, sphincter mobility, polyps

ENT endoscopy: for upper throat damage?

Ph test and mobility test in throat: for sphincter function and acid content

Nerve tests: for nerves regulating digestive processes (emphasis on sphincters)

Spinal tests: contacted physio and osteo for musculoskeletal checks

Anything else to consider, trying to be as comprehensive as possible, no root cause diagnosis but gerd, gastritis and esophagitis have been thrown around.

Currently on 20mg omeprazole every 48hours, gradually weaning from 40mg daily

Used ibuprofen regularly from sep-dec 24. 


Age:31
Height: 5’11”
Gender: m
Medication: omeprazole
Smoking: no longer (may-September 2023/june-december 2024)
Previous and current medical issues: varicocele 2012, embolized, reoccurred 2023, current bilateral symptomatic, upper GI issues, began september 2024, worsened in scope and severity December 2024-current

Diet and lifetysle may bear upon upper GI issues: last decade marked by periods of intense physical work or very sedentary work, last three years, diet repetitive, carb based, late eating, last autumn - heavy spice foods

Smoking heavily for five six months over summer and into autumn past two months but not really decade before (weed only)

Dozen instances of mdma and lsd use since autumn 2023, used on night of swollen uvula: mdma crystal, lsd gummy and weed smoke - speculate may have irritated uvula and throat, and led to subsequent stomach inflammation or sphincter issues causing initial naxopharynx irritation (symptoms began with blocked or globus feeling up there, and morning halitosis). Suspected acid mist since no heartburn or stomach burning until december. Speculate regular ibuprofen use following uvula treatment may also have been core or multifactorial impactor.

Forgive me my trespasses, throat symtoms became continual start of December following existential terror episode and exhaustion following cutting out weed brownies and finishing college term (emotional burnout/stress?) Chest burning few days later, continued acid saliva since Boxing Day after suspected spice food induced 48hr episode of stomach burning and upper throat burning. Began omeprazole 27th december 2024. Tried coming off on clinicians advice two or so weeks later, substituting for famotidine. Extreme throat pain from suspected rebound or possible dietary choice. Famotidine incompatibility, some dysphagia and extreme dymouth. Resumed impasible and weaning off since.

Sleep raised, eat 3-6 small portions of alkalin food, chow down sodium alginate, DGL liquorice, aloe vera, stress management for gut brain axis wellbeing, exercise and hydration. Weight loss and interrupted sleep with vivid dreams nightly since start of December consistent with existential episode and continual upper GI symptoms onset. (Possible weed withdrawal rem overload symptoms?)

Managing with resilience, awareness of my shortcomings, previous well spirited middle class decent bloke now navigating readjustment and care treatment trajectory going forward. Awaiting tests and applying demulcents, seeking advice and help where I can get it.

Got private healthcare after symptoms presented, unsure if can consult with private gp for free or breach with moratorium.

Any questions, please ask 🙏

Possible gut dysbiosus, microflora imbalance (diet choices), inflammation leading to ulcers, fissure or polyps, presumed upper and lower esophagus sphincter dsyregulation (otherwise how acidsaliva and mist flow up), stool more recently constipate (every 2-3 days, one episode of cluster of pebbles, otherwise slightly more clay, softer over christmas and new year, sometimes looser (there have been diet adaptions).

Experienced dull and sharp stomach and abdomen pains nausea and dizziness since december but less common now (apart from dizziness on standing)

I'm trying to curb that impulse right now and take everything under fair consideration.

Context: my newly 3yo and I were at a coffee shop this morning, and kiddo wanted to stand in line and order their own treat. I was about 15 feet away the entire time and watching like a hawk. I interacted with anyone who said more than a quick greeting to kiddo and was within sight of the barista at the cash register at all times.

(Additional context, I was there after having done the grocery run for this shop. So, I was standing in a hallway putting milk away while watching kiddo)

Apparently the baristas had a very different view of this. I got a call from one of the owners a few hours later saying the baristas were super concerned and didn't know where I was, and actually thought I had gone to the bathroom (but I was within sight the entire time!)??  They also got a concerned email from a customer. I was also told that they've been getting comments for a few months about 'the wild child' (no examples given of what behavior earned this title, and I can't think of anything that I didn't immediately correct) at the shop. 

So clearly I'm in the wrong.  I'm not really arguing that, even though it doesn't feel like I was wrong yet.  I think I'm just struggling to figure out where the line is between giving independence and having a 'wild child'.  Because clearly I'm doing something wrong. ",1,1739215428.0,Mommit,5,1.0,False

But fear not, adventurers of the digital realm, because RaccoonLine is here to flip the script on online anonymity. Why settle for mere hiding when you can become truly invisible?

Imagine RaccoonLine as your personal digital smokescreen, not your run-of-the-mill VPN. Instead of predictable server routes that get blocked faster than you can say ""privacy,"" RaccoonLine's Web3 VPN sends your data zig-zagging through a dynamic maze of user nodes, layering on encryption like no tomorrow. Each time you connect, it’s a different route, leading to a web of unpredictability that leaves hackers scratching their heads. It's like having a tiny VPN army working in your favor!

But wait, there’s more! This tech not only shields you from prying eyes but also foils cyber threats before they even have a chance. With built-in protections against DNS spoofing, you can surf the net while leaving the bad guys in the dust. And let’s not forget about the unique ""Wandering Flow"" mode that keeps switching up your connection route—one minute, you’re bouncing through Asia; the next, you’re lounging in Europe—all while cruising the net safely and swiftly.

Want to earn while staying safe? RaccoonLine takes the cake! For minimal energy consumption, you can transform your idle devices into ROCC tokens. Forget the power-hungry Bitcoin mining; here, your router and phone work for you, turning excess bandwidth into straight-up rewards. Plus, the network gets faster as more users join—not slower. Now that’s something to cheer about!

So, why not join the RaccoonLine decentralized VPN beta test that started on January 29? Test premium features for free for up to 14 days and earn up to 2500 ROCC tokens for feedback that shapes the product. Highlights include unlimited access, early looks at a Windows app, and even mining client access!

This is more than just testing; it's about building a revolutionary privacy tool that’s as essential as your morning coffee. Whether you're a privacy advocate, technology enthusiast, or token hoarder, RaccoonLine welcomes all into this journey for true online invisibility.

Unleash the power of decentralized privacy. Embrace the beta, become part of the RaccoonLine community, and let's redefine what it means to be invisible online.

1ime7m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Separation/comments/1ime7m4/its_been_confusing_and_hard_to_navigate/,It's been confusing and hard to navigate,"Myself (30M) and my wife (30F) separated after 7 years being together, 2 years married, and have been separated for a little under a month now. We both have a house in a different province, and we both moved out simultaneously back to our respective parents' homes in a completely different province. She wants to sell the house and then work towards divorce, but we still haven't managed to find a buyer; not that I'm in a rush.

It was her decision to separate after neglect on my part led to us falling into a routine where we were little more than roommates to her. She had silently been trying for the year prior to steer things back on course with me, but ultimately gave up quietly months ago before finally bringing up separating and divorce. Unbeknownst to me, she also engaged in an EA with someone she'd been talking to about her struggles for a while. Initially I did everything I could think of to convince her not to give up on our marriage and work it out together. Obviously didn't work out, and here we are split from one another.

I've spent my time alone learning what my issues are, where I went wrong, and to take accountability and responsibility for my actions. I've started going to therapy, and bless my therapist because she is incredibly insightful and professional and in just a few sessions has helped me connect some dots on where I lie with my own internal issues. In this small time span I've done a lot of reading, a lot of introspection, and a lot of learning what a relationship should entail between a couple. I've learned to see my mistakes for what they are, and what it was about myself that led to me making them. I've learned to listen, to acknowledge, and to validate the feelings of my partner - and not just react to the surface level of what she says to me. I think I still have much more to go, but frankly I'm proud of the progress I'm making and I think, in time, I'll be the better, stronger person I should have been earlier.

But that said, every day she lingers in my mind. I was pretty pushy and desperate early on before our separation began, and the process of us moving out of the house put even more strain on her that she blamed me for. I've since then tried to hold myself back and keep my attention on myself, but it's been nigh impossible not to think about her and wonder how she's doing. I keep finding myself waiting for when her name lights up on my phone, and so I've been trying to toss my phone aside and focus on other tasks, so that I don't overthink about her.

It's been strange and sad, and truthfully I don't fully know where her head is sometimes. No concrete boundaries were ever discussed between the two of us, and we're far from being in a no contact situation as we speak with one another daily over text. She sends me various pictures and texts over Snapchat, and we text on messenger all the time, occasionally making jokes or shooting the shit lightly. We regularly text each other ""Good morning"" whenever we wake, and we also tend to end the day wishing each other good night. Some days she talks with me for extended periods of time, and a few times had even opened up a bit emotionally to me. She's also prodded me to see I'm doing okay, and will ask if I need to talk or vent if she detects I'm not feeling my best. But then sometimes she's cold and distant, and will wall herself off, and leave dry, short responses when we talk.

Perhaps unwise, but I've attempted a few times to reach out and arrange for us to get together in person just to hang out; or I've offer to help her with unpacking her things and assembling furniture at her place. Usually I'm met with soft no's, and I don't push. We've met 3 times since we separated - Once when I dropped a load of her things off for her and we caught up for an hour or so. The second time it was dropping off more of her things, only this time I ended up staying with her for almost the whole day. She had surprise ordered food in anticipation of my visit, and I had ended up surprising her with her favourite coffee. We talked a bunch, she showed me her progress on redoing her living space, and she ended up allowing me to help her with assembling a piece of furniture for her. We drank some wine together, she got emotional at one point, and I just tried to be understanding and give her reassurances. Later on in the night we said our goodbyes and I headed home. The third time we met was the night after; I had convinced her to come hang out with our friend group because she had been feeling isolated. I even offered to drive her since her car had been acting up, and she accepted. It was a bit more awkward this time, but we were also among friends and I think she wasn't quite adjusted to being out and seeing all her friends again. On the ride home that night we again ended up talking about us, and nothing really substantial came of it. She was still pretty much on the mental path of divorce.

Again, it's so strange and sad. We're still able to enjoy each other's company, but there's this wall between her and I that doesn't seem to want to let up. I know I can't control that, and I don't even intend to stay focused on that. I only want to worry about becoming my best self, and maybe if she wants to see that then she can peek out from behind the wall she's set up. I myself know if she did, we'd be alright - she just needs to realize that herself too. 

But it's so very sad how much love I have for this woman still, and how we can still get along when we're together. The biggest hurdle is that she doesn't trust me or believe in our marriage, and that's entirely out of my control and I have to accept it. Maybe I'm a god damned fool for it, but I'm choosing to keep loving her until it's over for good.",3,1739214627.0,Separation,0,1.0,False

Hi all,

I’m currently tackling **75 Hard** and wanted to share my approach to **meals and nutrition** throughout the challenge.

**If you’re starting soon and wondering how to structure your diet, this guide will help!**

# What I Did

For **75 Hard**, I committed to a clean and sustainable meal plan that aligned with my fitness goals. Since **the challenge doesn’t specify a diet**, I focused on whole, nutrient-dense foods while avoiding processed junk.

Here’s how I approached my diet:

* **Lean proteins** (chicken, fish, lean beef, eggs)
* **Healthy fats** (avocados, nuts, olive oil)
* **Complex carbs** (brown rice, sweet potatoes, quinoa)
* **Plenty of vegetables** for fibre and nutrients
* **1 gallon of water per day** to stay hydrated

I eliminated:

* Processed foods
* Refined sugars
* Alcohol
* Junk snacks

# What I Found

At first, **meal prepping** was key. Having a structured plan helped me avoid making poor food choices when hunger hit.

* **Energy levels fluctuated** in the first few days as my body adapted.
* **Hydration made a huge difference**—the gallon of water rule really helps!
* **Protein intake kept me full and helped with muscle recovery** after workouts.
* **Cravings faded** after the first week as I stuck to whole foods.
* **Mindset played a big role**—it’s not just about food, but discipline.

# My Meal Plan Breakdown

I found that **structuring my meals** into balanced macronutrients worked best. Here’s a sample of my **daily meals**:

**Breakfast:** Scrambled eggs with spinach + whole-grain toast + black coffee  
**Lunch:** Grilled chicken + quinoa + roasted vegetables  
**Dinner:** Baked salmon + brown rice + avocado  
**Snacks:** Greek yoghurt + almonds / protein shake / fruit

For **flexibility**, I rotated proteins (chicken, turkey, fish, lean beef) and adjusted carbs based on my activity level.

# But What Really Surprised Me?

The biggest takeaway for me was **how much food impacts discipline and mindset**.

It wasn’t just about eating clean—it was about **making conscious choices, planning ahead, and staying consistent**. After a few weeks, I noticed:

* **Better focus & energy levels**
* **Reduced cravings & emotional eating**
* **Faster recovery after workouts**
* **Overall improvement in my discipline & habits**

# What’s the Lesson?

If you’re starting **75 Hard**, here’s what I recommend:

* **Choose a diet you can sustain for 75 days** (not an extreme crash diet).
* **Meal prep** to avoid last-minute unhealthy choices.
* **Stay hydrated**—the gallon of water rule helps with cravings & recovery.
* **Balance your macros** (protein, carbs, fats) for steady energy.
* **Be disciplined, but don’t overcomplicate it**—keep it simple and realistic.

I go **more in-depth** about my 75 Hard meal plan, grocery lists, and common mistakes to avoid in my full article here: [https://goodlife-app.com/75-hard-meals-the-definitive-guide-you-need/](https://goodlife-app.com/75-hard-meals-the-definitive-guide-you-need/)

I use a Quamar M80E grinder (with ~2,500 grinds on it) paired with an older Gaggia Classic machine (OPV set to 9 bar). I buy fresh coffee beans from a local roaster, vacuum-seal most of the batch, and freeze them to preserve freshness.  

**The Problem:**  
I dose 14g of beans and aim for a 28–35g yield in 25 seconds. However, my shots are pulling too fast—reaching the target yield in just 15 seconds. I know grinding finer should help, but my Quamar is already set so fine that it takes 15 seconds to grind 14g. If I go even one click finer, the grinder jams and stops working.  

**My Question:**  
Could this issue be caused by low-quality beans, or is my grinder malfunctioning? I’ve thoroughly cleaned the grinder, and the burrs *appear* undamaged, but I’m stuck.  ",1,1739214310.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

1ime170,https://www.reddit.com/r/cronometer/comments/1ime170/my_long_term_reviewexperiencedata_point/,My Long Term Review/Experience/Data Point,"I usually use Reddit to search for data points on things, and typically people don't post when things are going good, so I wanted to provide some detail on how Cronometer has worked for me, my recommendations and insights. I'm on a 230 day streak of using the app. So everyday.

Background:

* I started really trying to lose weight April 2024, and started using Cronometer late June 2024. I'm 5'8, late 20s male. I was about 200lbs-205lbs March 2024, and I am now 160lbs. My ""average"" adult weight was around 172lbs, but I went on a ""bulk"" that, while I had good intentions, turned into just some depression and never doing a cut afterward, so just stayed up there.
* I have a decent-to-good base of fitness and understanding of exercise. Not quite athlete/sports level, but I did lifting in high school, was in the army, and even though I have many injuries I have to work around, I still try to get to the gym 2x-3x a week for a mix of cardio/lifting, and have some free weights at home to supplement. Typical sessions last 45-90 minutes, really just depends. Sometimes I'll go more often, sometimes I'll be sick/hurt and not exercise for a few weeks.
* I never was much a fast food person, drink an insane amount of water, and don't drink alcohol. I also can't eat gluten anymore so easy carbs are more restricted for me to eat. My biggest food ""sin"" is probably the insane amount of Coke Zero I'm able to put down. Mitigated by only using straws (easy on the teeth), drinking a lot of water, and otherwise good habits, I'm fine with this being my vice. I don't drink coffee either.

Starting Weight Loss

* March 2024 I had to get on antibiotics for a different health issue, and they nuked my appetite. Normally bad, but for me this really helped kick off my weight loss, let my stomach shrink a bit, and re imagine my portion sizes and snacking.
* After losing a bit of weight over the next few months (maybe like 5-10lbs, before I started tracking), I wanted to get serious. Bought a food scale, started weighing everything, and got Cronometer.

Using Cronometer

* I started off using it religiously. Use sedentary TDEE, with TEF \*off\*. Weigh every meal at home, when I eat out I find the closest thing and even try to over estimate a bit. I bought premium like a month after using it.
* I've kept with a very maintainable 250kcal deficit. Some days I'll go over (sometimes way over), some days I'll be under. Somedays I'll skip breakfast, somedays I'll do 3x meals and snacks. Biggest thing for me is the weekly average. Having a fun night out and not worrying about 100% tracking accuracy, is a fine and good thing. When things get too restrictive is when people just stop. Have fun, eat a bunch, just tweak the rest of your day/week to suit it.
* Cronometer having the ability to scan barcodes is a game changer, and it's nutrient values seem much closer to real life vs something community sourced like myfitnesspal or the like.
* This gave me a whole new understanding of how insanely calorie dense some things are, and how eye-balling portion sizes really doesn't work that well unless you've weighed it so often you can tell that way. Cheeses, desserts, cereals, breads/carbs, and especially eating out.
* Weighing your food is a requirement, not a recommendation. You need to know what is going in your body to keep up with weight loss, AND having the historical data is hugely beneficial. Over time, you will also get better at eyeballing how many grams a serving is even if you don't weigh it (e.g. if I get a chicken breast when I'm out, I'm much closer on my estimates now than before).

Today

* Like I said, I've lost just about 40lbs in 10 months, which is pretty cleanly 1lb/week | 4lbs/month. Since 1lb of weight gain = 3500kcal, this would impute I actually have closer to a daily deficit of 500kcal, vs my targeted 250kcal. I'm sure it's a combination of: I'd rather overestimate than under, I have TEF off, and I think the exercise kcal amounts in Cronometer may be a bit conservative. Either way, if there's ever a choice, I always assume I'm eating more and burning less. This turns out to always have a happy outcome for me lol.
* I feel loads better just generally. I have permanent musculo-skeletal issues, and joints pains, etc. I've also had high blood pressure/cholesterol at times. Simply by having less weight to move around with, has actually made my pain go down a bit, and make some exercises easier. Imagine doing what you do now, but do it with a 40lb vest on. World of difference.
* It takes a very high level of effort to cut AND gain muscle mass at the same time. I've likely lost a bit of strength/muscle along the way, but eating a lot of protein and still at least trying to lift regularly will help loads. I'm still able to mostly keep up at the level of lifting I've done before.

General Tips

* There's people much smarter than me to give nutrition advice, just make sure you look into registered dietitian/peer reviewed/experts, not instagram/youtube influencers trying to tell you that ""X"" is the solution, vs a holistic and disciplined approach.
* \#1: Low calorie protein is king. Nonfat plain greek yogurt with a little honey/little granola. Deli turkey/chicken. Ground turkey in pastas/stews, Chicken breast, boneless pork chops (VERY surprisingly lean, just cut off the fat). Not fried, not breaded (easy for me since I can't have gluten)
* \#2: Fruit is great, but expensive. You can get like a pound of strawberries for like under 100kcal. Depends on your budget, but berries/bananas/apples are awesome in this sense.
* \#3: Treat yourself, just differently. Halo top & sorbet for dessert, Fair Life skim milk vs regular,
* \#4: Chug water before/during/after meals, and just throughout the day. It'll make you feel fuller and less likely so snack.
* \#5: Boredom kills. When you are occupied by stuff you like, or out and about, you are far less likely to think about food. When I'm really into a new game, I'm not thinking about food. When I'm out for the day with my friends, there's no easily accessible snacks.
* \#6 Track even when it hurts. No one is coming for your life if you overeat by 1000kcals that day. Just do it smart, maybe skip breakfast that day, or be more disciplined the rest of the week. I've had +1500kcal days just knowing I wanted to go to an all you can eat place. It'll even out over time. It helps when you do the previous advice of over estimating as well.

I'm sure there's a bunch of stuff I missed, so I might add some edits. Feel free to ask questions and I'll try to respond as well. Hope this helps someone, so in short, Cronometer (premium) 10/10 investment assuming you use it smartly and regularly, even when you don't want to.",4,1739214216.0,cronometer,2,1.0,False

**Nerdy introvert with big dreams, seeking my future wife**

I’m looking for a monogamous, committed relationship that leads to marriage. I want to build a cozy home and a happy, comfortable life with someone who’s ready to communicate and grow with me.

By day, I work as a junior electrician in construction, with plans to study electrical engineering and become a chartered engineer by 40. My dream is to work in renewable technology or intelligent building design. I love DIY and fixing things—there’s nothing more satisfying than building something or bringing it back to life. I’m passionate about construction and plan to stay in the industry long-term.

In my free time, I’m a D&D nerd who enjoys PC gaming, cooking delicious meals, and quiet afternoons with a cup of tea and an audiobook. My big dream is to build a travel van and explore the UK and Europe on holidays. I’m deeply left-wing in my values, and I’d need the same in my partner.

I’m deeply empathetic and emotionally available, and I value authenticity in myself and in others. During the week, I’m a homebody who recharges with simple comforts, but on weekends, I run a women’s social club that I’ve worked hard to build. I love going out with the group to try coffee shops, restaurants, and cultural activities.

Ideally, I’d love to meet someone artistic and creative to balance out my technical skills—someone who can fill life with color, music, and imagination. I’m currently childfree but open to seriously discussing having kids—it’s something I’d want us to decide together as a team.

I’m building a life that’s true to me, and while I hope to stay in my area long-term, I’m open to long-distance for the right person. If this resonates with you, don’t be shy—reach out! I’d love to hear your story and see where it takes us.

*Many individuals find themselves wrestling with the profound difference between solitude and loneliness, often misinterpreting their true meanings. Solitude transcends mere separation from others; it is an enriching experience—a personal sanctuary that fosters self-appreciation and initiates a journey of self-discovery.*

*Imagine a sun-drenched afternoon, where you nestle into a sumptuous nook, surrounded by plump, inviting pillows and a cocoon of warm, textured blankets. A captivating novel lies open in your lap, its pages whispering tales of adventure and wonder. Golden sunlight spills through the window, casting a radiant glow that envelops you in a warm embrace, creating a cocoon of serenity.*

*Alternatively, envision a tranquil stroll through an enchanting forest where towering trees create a harmonious canopy above. Sunlight dances through the leaves, painting the ground with dappled patches of light. The gentle breeze carries the soft rustle of foliage while the ground beneath you crunches softly with every step, each sound blending into a soothing symphony that complements the rhythm of your thoughts.*

*In stark contrast, loneliness envelops you like a thick fog, weighing heavily on your heart with an aching desire for connection. It manifests as a relentless craving to belong, often inviting a gnawing sense of boredom when faced with the stillness of your mind.*

*Consider this thought-provoking question: How can you expect others to revel in the joy of your presence if you have not first unearthed the delight that resides in your own company? Embracing solitude is more than just beneficial; it is a transformative journey.*

*Imagine yourself fully immersed in your favourite hobbies, the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafting through the air as you cradle the warm mug in your hands. You sit in a quaint café, surrounded by the soft murmur of distant conversations, blissfully removed from the chaos of daily life.*

*Now, envision lying on a sun-dappled patch of grass, the earth comforting beneath you, as you gaze upward at the expansive blue sky. Fluffy white clouds drift lazily overhead, each one a canvas for your imagination to paint upon, inviting you to wander through daydreams and possibilities.*

*These moments of solitude are far beyond mere simple pleasures; they are enchanting experiences that immerse you in the richness of life, allowing you to discover and embrace the happiness within yourself.*

*This journey into solitude invites you to delve deep into the very essence of who you are, revealing hidden facets of your personality that await your discovery. As you explore these inner landscapes, you nurture your personal growth, empowering yourself to draw strength from within, illuminating your path and enhancing your connection with others.*

*It’s fascinating to observe how often individuals voice an intense yearning for constant companionship as if true happiness is solely born from the presence of others. Yet, through my journey, I’ve uncovered a contrasting truth: the deep-seated joy I find in revelling in my own company far eclipses the fleeting thrills of bustling social gatherings filled with surface-level interactions. In my cherished moments of solitude, I have unearthed rich insights about my true self, continually evolving and reshaping my identity as I embrace and savour each tranquil moment alone.*

*Solitude weaves a captivating spell that ignites my creativity and awakens my imagination. Envision yourself nestled by a rain-speckled window on a tranquil afternoon, where the world outside is a blurred canvas of shimmering droplets. The soft patter of rain against the glass creates a soothing rhythm, like a gentle lullaby that beckons you into a realm of deep reflection. As you gaze out, your thoughts begin to drift like clouds across a limitless sky, sailing through a vast ocean of dreams and possibilities.*

*This transformative experience is not merely a release; it is an exhilarating expedition into the profound depths of my mind and soul. Within the serene embrace of solitude lie countless hidden treasures, yet one sensation sparkles above the rest: the delightful flutter of anticipation that ignites new adventures. Whether I'm embarking on an impromptu road trip through winding, sun-drenched back roads, with the golden rays filtering through the leaves, or daring to savour an exotic dish that explodes with vibrant flavours at a bustling local restaurant, that intoxicating rush of excitement envelops my spirit. It infuses my life with an electrifying sense of vitality, urging me to embrace every moment with open arms and an adventurous heart.*

*The profound freedom that solitude offers me unfolds like a vast, open landscape, inviting exploration and self-discovery. In this cherished stillness, I find a serene peace that wraps around me like a gentle embrace, untouched by the clamour of the outside world. This state of being feels like a return to my truest self, a place where I can breathe deeply and reflect.*

*I am excited to embark on this journey with you, sharing captivating stories and heartfelt reflections that illuminate the breathtaking beauty and transformative power of solitude. I hope to inspire you to embrace the rich tapestry of your own company, allowing the hidden treasures within you to surface. Only when you uncover these gems can your inner light truly radiate, encouraging others to seek and find their brilliance.*

One minute you’re sipping that morning coffee, and the next thing you know, you’re shutting down your laptop at 10 p.m., wondering where the time went. Sound familiar? There’s a simple trick that can help you figure out exactly where your hours are vanishing: **time-tracking.**

I used to think time-tracking meant writing down every little second of my day in some nerdy spreadsheet (spoiler alert: it can be way simpler and less “Type-A” than that). Once I figured out a method that fit my style, it became my superpower for getting things done without feeling like I was chained to a to-do list. It’s kinda like budgeting for your day—knowing how you *spend* your time lets you decide how you *want* to spend it.

**Why bother?**  
• **It highlights habits you didn’t see coming.** Spend 15 minutes too long on Instagram every day? That’s *76 hours* a year—yikes!  
• **It reduces stress.** Once you see a pattern, you’ll have a better idea of how to balance work, chores, and “me time.”  
• **It helps you work smarter.** You can schedule tasks when you’re naturally more focused and creative (morning person, anyone?).

**How to do it without losing your mind:**  
1. **Pick a tool that feels good to you.** Some people love apps like Toggl or Clockify; others just use pen and paper. No shame in a simple approach.  
2. **Start small.** Track just one part of your day—like your work tasks or your evening routine. No need to go from zero to 24/7 surveillance.  
3. **Be honest with yourself.** If you spent 30 minutes scrolling memes, write it down. It's not about guilt; it's about awareness (so you can plan better tomorrow).  
4. **Review your data.** Look back at the end of the week. Notice any spikes in productivity or random black holes of time? Adjust accordingly.

I’ve found that time-tracking actually *frees* you from wasting energy rather than boxing you in. It’s a weird twist, but trust me—you’ll see the difference pretty quickly. And the best part? You don’t have to be perfect at it. Even half-decent tracking can open your eyes to where your day goes.

Sometimes it’s the small steps that lead to the biggest changes. A few minutes of daily tracking might just reveal the secret sauce to a calmer, more productive routine. If you give it a shot, you may find you have more time for the things that truly matter—like finally binging that new show guilt-free.",1,1739213871.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1imdrgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1imdrgt/finding_the_right_machine_grinder_2000/,Finding the right machine + grinder [2000$],"Hello everyone,

I'm currently diving into the rabbit hole of finding the right espresso machine + grinder for my needs and my budget. I've already done a bit of research on my own, watched youtube videos, read blog entries... etc. but I would love to hear some more input from other people out there.

**Budget:**

Around 2000$, give or take 200$ for the whole setup.

**Usage:**

Mostly milk-based drinks (cappuccino, flat white). I live by myself and drink around 2 milk-based drinks per day (morning and afternoon) - although not every day due to work. I would like to be able to serve maybe 1-2 more people every now and then, so when I have friends or my parents over I could make them an afternoon cappuccino, or an espresso after dinner.

**Functionality**

I consider myself to be more of a hobbyist who enjoys a good cup of coffee. I don't see myself tampering with temperature/pressure settings all the time. At most, I'd try a different kind of roast every once in a while but probably not on a very regular basis.

**Size**

I have limited-ish counter space so unfortunately, I cannot go for a huge machine, although most ""standard"" machines should work.

**Looks**

I'll shamelessly admit that looks are kinda important to me. For example, I really like the aesthetic of e61 groupheads, so unless some machine knocks it out of the park in all other aspects, the look and feel of the machine do play a role in my decision.

  
**Key Factors that I look for**

* Reliable, good-looking espresso machine that won't make me want to upgrade after 1 year. Ideally, I'd use it for a long time
* Good steam performance is important to me
* Start-up time is not a deal breaker, I'll just use a smart plug if it's ""too"" long
* PID is nice to have

**Shortlist**

I've shortlisted a couple of options that popped up during my research. As for the grinder, I'll most likely go for the Eureka Mignon ORO Single Dose or maybe a DF64, although I'm very open to other suggestions.

Regarding the Espresso Machine, a couple of machines repeatedly came up:

* Lelit Mara X (V2)
* Profitec Pro 400
* Lelit Elizabeth (ruled out due to aesthetics)
* Rocket Appartamento (read some mixed reviews here)
* Breville Dual Boiler (I know that it's a great machine but I really don't like the look)

I would love to hear from you guys what you think! Maybe you've been in a similar situation before or maybe you've tried one of the machines that I've shortlisted.

1imdpd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueCrimeDiscussion/comments/1imdpd8/justyn_rosen_a_man_murdered_by_his_mistress/,Justyn Rosen a man murdered by his mistress Teresa Perez,"Sunday-Tuesday, October 5-7 and 10, 2003 ” Justyn Rosen, a Denver car dealership owner, died in an evening rush-hour shooting Friday after he was kidnapped by his long-term mistress Teresa Perez. Teresa, whom the newspapers described repeatedly as a gold digger stalked and married older, wealthy men, sources told The Denver Post.



Restraining order sought by Mr. Rosen before slaying





The 79-year-old auto dealer had tried for months to end his relationship with Teresa Perez. But the 40-year-old woman who once worked for Rosen refused to let go.



Teresa Perez and Justyn Rosen met about seven years ago when she took a job as a saleswoman at his dealership. Teresa told people the two grew closer over coffee breaks and lunches.



She threatened to expose their relationship to Rosen's wife of 60 years â€” then made good on the pledge, according to a sworn statement Rosen gave the day before he died. She stalked him, left regular threatening phone messages and promised to expose their relationship to a wider audience â€” his children.



Rosen's lawyer, Craig Silverman, warned Teresa Perez last month to leave his client alone. Colorado law looks particularly harshly on offenses committed against elderly at-risk persons, Silverman wrote Perez on September 15th . Such offenses are mandatory sentencing crimes in Colorado which resulted in aggravated mandatory prison sentences. Mr. Rosen is nearly eighty years old and your days of bothering him are now over.



He was wrong.

Justyn Rosen had taken out a restraining order against his former employee the day before she shot and killed him.



Mr. Rosen obtained the temporary order against Ms. Perez on Thursday morning from Judge Kathleen M. Bowers in Denver County Court, alleging abuse of the elderly and stalking.



Details of Rosen's troubles with Ms. Perez are contained in his application for the restraining order. Rosen wrote to the court that Perez had delivered a packet of information to his wife to try to hurt his marriage. He said she recently made it clear that she was willing to deliver similar packages of information to my children and other people I care about if I terminate our relationship and stop providing her money.



In the court papers he doesn't describe the exact nature of his relationship with Teresa Perez but did say in the sworn statement:



Several years ago, I became involved in a relationship with Teresa Perez. While I initially welcomed Ms. Perez's company, I have many times recently sought to end my relationship with her. In response, Ms. Perez has consistently demanded money from me to support herself and she is unwilling to let me terminate our relationship.



Rosen said that in recent months Teresa Perez followed him to and from work and to and from restaurants whether he was alone, or with his wife and friends. Mr. Rosen also stated that:



Further, on the phone and in person, Teresa Perez has repeatedly called me abusive names including ' asshole', ' liar' and a ' dirty Jew.' She has frequently made derogatory references to my Jewish heritage especially in the context of my unwillingness to fulfill her demands for monetary payments. She has repeatedly told me during the last couple months of her belief that all Jewish people deserve to suffer because they are bad.



Rosen also noted in his affidavit that Ms. Perez left vitriolic messages full of insults on his cellular phone voice mail. He said that when he did answer the phone, she' d berate him with insults and demands he meet her.



He said he had become increasingly concerned about what she might do. Teresa Perez represents a threat to my mental and physical health... I made the mistake of giving her money in the past and now she feels that she is entitled to more money. She is not, Rosen wrote. Because of my age and physical and mental condition, I feel as if Teresa Perez has long been manipulating and taking advantage of me. I need it to end now.



The court found that Rosen and Teresa Perez had an intimate relationship.



Sheriff's deputies attempted to serve Teresa Perez with the restraining order Thursday and Friday but could not locate her. A woman in Ohio, Patricia Wietzel, who befriended Teresa when she served as her foster mother, said Ms. Perez was aware that authorities were trying to reach her but was too distraught to answer the door. Ms. Wietzel said Perez was at her wits' end because Justyn Rosen was calling off what Teresa considered to be an intimate and lasting relationship.



But Teresa Perez is reported by other sources to have pursued Mr. Rosen solely in an effort to get money and attention. Rosen's widow said her husband fired Perez years ago.



She did work for him for a while, but he had to let her go because she was so much trouble, Marian Rosen said. She was a very sick woman.



But on Friday, October 10th the Denver Post reported that each month Justyn Rosen slipped $100 bills under his mistress' door at her plush apartment.



Rosen, 79, gave Teresa Perez, 40, wads of cash to pay for plane trips to his $400,000 Scottsdale, Arizona, home and to pay off a hospital debt when she sprained her ankle snowboarding.



Using cash was how Rosen concealed a six-year affair with a woman who spent her adult life charming wealthy or well-established older men and marrying them for their money.



But when Rosen became ill with cancer and tried to sever their private relationship, Teresa Perez instead ended it on her terms in a very public way.



Kidnapped and slain

Top



Mr. Rosen was gunned down Friday evening after he was taken at gunpoint from his east Denver home. Teresa Perez drove a rental car to Rosen's home and left it running, blocking his driveway. As he pulled up, she jumped into his SUV with him and pulled a gun. She then forced him to drive his SUV near the 2200 block of Colorado Boulevard, just west of the Denver Police Gang Unit building in City Park, according to a police source. There Mr. Rosen managed to get out of the vehicle and was trying to flag down a police officer for help when he was shot by Teresa Perez, who reportedly was a good shot. She also shot at police officers who responded to Rosen's calls for help. She was then killed by shots fired by three police officers. She slightly wounded one of those officers before she fell.



Investigators searching Teresa Perez's car found a letter, penned by Ms. Perez. That letter was reproduced in full in the October 11, 2003 edition of the Rocky Mountain News (p. 21A).



Officer Randy Yoder was caught in the gunfire and was grazed by a bullet. He was treated at Denver Health Medical Center and released.



Justyn Rosen leaves behind his wife of 60 years, Marian, two daughters, three grandchildren and a large network of extended family and friends.



Long record of marriage, divorce, theft, and violence

Top



Teresa Perez nee Garret had been married at least four times.



Perez was charged in 1993 with a felony fraud count when she used his identification to buy a $500 camcorder. She pled guilty.



Bob Costello, circa 1983

Teresa Garrett's first common-law husband was Bob Costello, a longtime employee of the Rocky Mountain News who now works for the Denver Newspaper Agency. They had a daughter who is now 20-years old.



Costello, then 40, met Teresa Garrett on the street and invited the beautiful 19-year-old homeless woman to stay at his home. The two occasionally went out into fields and fired pistols. Perez could hit bottles and cans with ease, he said.



Within a year, a romance with the man old enough to be her father developed. The couple had a daughter, whom Costello raised until she was 5.



It wasn't until years later that Costello, a maintenance worker, realized his young common-law spouse needed more than love.



She related money to happiness and security, Costello said. She looked at these men as a father/husband, and the two didn't go together.



Vincent Rieger, 1988-1989

Teresa next married a Denver construction and real estate business owner 41 years older than her.



In 1988 Teresa was introduced to wealthy construction and real estate owner Vincent Rieger in a pricey restaurant. She later invited him to lunch, said his daughter, Linda Rieger.



Rieger was a successful 66-year-old businessman, a Navy fighter-pilot ace who shot down five planes in World War II. Teresa was a car dealership saleswoman, a 25-year-old mother with a young daughter.



With Teresa three-months pregnant, the couple married in December 1988 in a luxurious downtown hotel, but filed for divorce less than three weeks later. They reconciled around the time their son was born in June 1989. But Teresa filed for divorce the following December. For a year after that, Mr. Rieger fought her for custody of their son and eventually prevailed.



We got along great until we got married, Rieger said.



She was something, said Burt Boothby, a former business associate of Vincent Rieger. She was looking for a big daddy. There wasn't any question she was after money. Vince gave her a home in Cherry Hills and that didn't seem to satisfy her.



Because of their age difference, Vincent Rieger and Teresa, who was young enough to be his granddaughter, made an odd-looking couple, particularly to the groom's children.



A week after Teresa married Rieger, she bought a new Cadillac without telling her husband, said Rieger Jr., a son from a previous marriage.



It became clear real soon the whole objective was money, he said. She was a classic gold digger.



Conflicts between the couple erupted soon after their wedding. During one altercation, Teresa struck her husband and apparently his BMW with a golf club. On another occasion she arranged to have Rieger arrested for drunk driving. Rieger also said that Teresa had made threats against his life when they were married.



During the lengthy and vicious divorce Teresa at first had possession of their Cherry Creek home. A custody war ensued. Rieger won all major battles, including custody of their son, after a judge found Teresa had little interest or involvement with her son.



In November 1990, then-Denver District Court Judge Lynne Hufnagel noted some of the same characteristics Mr. Rosen listed in his affidavit for a restraining order when she presided over the divorce of Vincent Rieger and Teresa Perez.



Judge Hufnagel noted that Ms. Perez had an IQ of 86 (average is 100), expressed considerable anger, and had a comfort with harsh judgmentalness towards individuals who are weak or different from most people.



Judge Hufnagel also found that Teresa ” then known as Teresa Rieger ” had often resorted to what she termed almost pathological lying. She appeared to have difficulty being empathic and forgiving and could be perceived as being self-absorbed, the judge said. Further, Judge Hufnagel said Teresa blamed others for her problems, was disorganized, and was alienated from her family, friends and significant people in her life.



In awarding the child to Vincent Rieger, Hufnagel noted that Teresa Perez already had a 6-year-old, had no high school education and had very few resources intellectually, personally or financially.



A mental profile completed during the divorce found Teresa had scored high on the psychopathic deviate and paranoia scales. She was self-absorbed and had a strong need for affection and attention, doctors found.



When Vincent Rieger Sr. took back ownership of his house, he found it empty of lifelong possessions: Every couch, table, chair, bed, article of clothing and knick-knack was gone.



Rieger's daughter, Linda, said Teresa cleaned out the house and sold almost everything in it. Among the items missing were heirlooms, such as the Navy ace's uniform and medals and his flight log book documenting his aerial kills.



Vincent Rieger said he was contacted by police about the death on Saturday night. I'm concerned about the child, he said. I don't want him to be embarrassed. I want this all to be over with soon.â€



Michael P. Mansfield, 1993-1996

Teresa's experience with Vincent Rieger didn't lessen her interest in older men. Michael P. Mansfield, who is 20 years older than she was, was married to her between March 1993 and December 1996.



Mansfield, 60, said Teresa stalked him as well in 1993, thinking the real estate agent was wealthy. But he led her to believe that by showering her with expensive gifts. Mansfield said he dated her for about four months, and she pursued him aggressively, following him around town.



Mansfield said he saw her shadowing his movements. He frequently spotted her trailing him in his neighborhood and near his real estate agency in the Denver area. She was stalking me. She must have watched his home, he said, because she would tell him about people who visited him. Mansfield said Teresa was full of charm and absolutely beautiful, which made her alluring to older, wealthier men. She was a gold digger, Mansfield said. That's kind of her portfolio.



They married in a quickie marriage chapel in Las Vegas in 1993 at Teresa's suggestion, Mansfield said.



Within months after they were married Mansfield caught her having affairs. She was...probably the toughest woman you ever met...She was very angry.



Teresa had a daughter and a son from her previous relationships. During their marriage Mansfield said she would go gambling at Central City until 2 AM three or four nights a week, leaving him to watch her small daughter.



When Mansfield confronted her about the gambling binges and reports by friends that she was dating other older men, she became hostile.



Teresa often threw things at Mansfield and struck him with her fists. You have to understand what she looked like, and it was the most surprising thing in the world, Mansfield said. She was a very angry person.



Their marriage was quickly in trouble, Mansfield said. Within a year, he agreed to relinquish his house to her and they divorced in December 1996.



Mario Perez, 1997-1999

After divorcing Mansfield, she married Mario Alberto Perez in December 1997. He was only 12 years her senior and a financial analyst earning nearly $90,000 a year.



By the time they divorced in 1999, Mario Perez was out of a job, saddled with debts and living on $1,200 a month in unemployment checks. And Teresa Perez was already involved with Justyn Rosen.



In 1999, when Mario Perez filed for divorce from Teresa Perez, he said he needed immediate court intervention because his wife was bankrupting him.



He claimed that Teresa had drained all of his bank accounts; forged his signature on checks; charged more than $42,000 in debt; maxed out all of his credit cards; and forged his signature on at least one or two credit-card offers.



Mario Perez said his wife had an extreme gambling addiction and was scheming to embezzle thousands of dollars from him.



Court records show a bitter, back-and-forth divorce. She was deliberately unemployed, the court found, and had a gambling addiction and lost amounts that  boggle the mind.



Records show she owed money to 12 casinos. On August 10, 1998, she withdrew more than $1,000 from ATMs to gamble with, which she blew in less than two hours.



The Justyn Rosen affair

While she was still married to the financial analyst, Teresa Perez went to work for Justyn Rosen. The relationship, that started two years before her divorce from Mario Perez, began with trips to coffee shops and restaurants and evolved into a romantic one.



After Teresa left Mario Perez, Rosen made $900-a-month apartment payments for her. He also gave her $400 a month for food. Her former lover, Bob Costello, also reported that Teresa called him and told him their daughter, then 14, had to move out because Rosen wanted her to live alone.



Although Rosen was 39 years her senior, Teresa was deeply in love with him according to Patricia Wietzel, her former foster mother. In telephone conversations three times a week with Wietzel, Teresa also gave intimate details of a sexual relationship, including hotel rendezvous. Wietzel said Teresa told her Rosen was getting acupuncture and testosterone treatments to help him sexually.



Rosen also gave Teresa a 2002 Ford Escape and they took trips to Dillon, Colorado, and Scottsdale, Arizona. Their plan was to move to California and live near a beach, Teresa told Wietzel.



About three years ago Teresa sent a letter to Rosen's wife of 60 years disclosing their affair. But the on-again, off-again affair continued according to Wietzel.



But age began to catch up to Justyn Rosen. In the summer of 2003 he reportedly had to have a number of radiation treatments and various medications for cancer. He repeatedly tried to end his relationship with Teresa. But Teresa couldn't let go and she kept stalking him.



I think he was tired and ready to sit down and be an old man, Patricia Wietzel said.



Minimal relationship with her father





Teresa Perez nee Garrett, was born in Los Angeles to Jerry Garret and Sonya Harvey. Her parents divorced three years after Teresa was born. She and an older sister, Monica, then moved to Zanesville, Ohio, with their father.



When he remarried, the wicked stepmother didn't want the girls, and the children were given to a foster family near Columbus that already had 10 biological children. The foster family lived in a 150-year-old farmhouse with no running water.



There is an abandonment issue I think she suffered from, Monica Garrett said. I feel Teresa didn't know how to work through it.



Teresa was a tomboy, her sister said. She had short hair and wore bib overalls. She was rough and tough growing up. She would go hunting and trapping...She didn't play Barbies very much.



The foster family they lived with treated the two girls like outsiders, even though they spent most of their childhood with them, Monica Garrett said.



How can a person have healthy relationships if you were not loved as a kid? she asked. And we weren't.



Teresa survived by immersing herself in sports. She played basketball and golf. Later she tried out for quarterback on a professional women's football team in Denver.



At 14, she moved in with Patricia Wietzel. There Teresa had her own horse and she would ride it through orchards by moonlight. She was a caring and giving person who had a good sense of humor and a fun personality according to Wietzel.



Teresa's father, Jerry Garrett, moved to Denver, where she joined him and her stepmother when she was 16. But they didn't get along, and Teresa left the house three years later, her stepmother throwing her clothes out of the house.



I think he (her father) loved her, but she was missing something, said Teresa's mother, Sonya Harvey. That's why I think she was involved with older men.



Teresa Perez's father, Wheat Ridge resident Jerry Garrett, said Monday that he had spoken to his daughter only twice in the past 15 years. Once, in 1998, Garrett suffered a heart attack and his daughter visited him in the hospital.



The second time, two months ago Teresa called Garrett seeking her birth mother's number and address in Southern California. Garrett asked his daughter to e-mail him later in the week and said he' d try to get the information. He said she never contacted him again. Her father thought that Teresa was rather cold each time they spoke.



Jerry Garrett called Teresa a good mother and said she never indicated she was having money problems. Of Teresa's two children, her father met only one, his 20-year-old granddaughter. He had never met his 14-year-old grandson.

1imdpbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1imdpbo/providing_a_safe_space_for_missionaries/,Providing a safe space for missionaries?,"Tl;dr: As a firm atheist with some curiosity about the LDS church and a background in youth work I've got a few questions regarding missionaries, inviting them over to my place and possibly creating a safe space for them.


But first, here's three paragraphs of a backstory: I'm a nevermo from Europe who got interested in the LDS church a few months ago. While I have been a firm atheist for almost 15 years now, learning about church history and doctrine (mostly from ex-mormons' perspectives) was and remains fascinating to me. I've read the CES letter, watched countless hours of Youtube videos, listened to some podcasts... Also explored parts of the official LDS website and had a look at some historical documents. As for another primary source I'd like to try reading the Book of Mormon and maybe even put a physical copy onto my shelf, right next to the Bible that I read and then disregarded so many years ago. On the LDS website I saw a form for requesting a free copy brought to one by local missionaries.


This led me down another rabbit hole of research and memories. I was reminded of a time around 2016 when I had recently started university. A friend's flatmate had invited the missionaries over to their place and they ended up becoming kind of a safe space for several ""generations"" of missionaries throughout the year. They were about our age, mostly fun to hang out with, talk to and play board games with. They never tried to convert me, but one of them served me by far the most delicious pancakes I've eaten to this day. If I remember correctly, one of them even had their first coffee in that same kitchen. At the same time, they seemed almost a little starved for ""normal"" human interaction, especially with people around their age. I've since done some research on LDS missionaries in general and was horrified to find out how little money and support they have.


With all of this in mind, I really feel like inviting my local missionaries over to get myself a Book of Mormon, cook for them and get to know them. I'd like to learn about the church from their perspective and maybe even spread a little bit of doubt by sharing mine, but first and foremost I'd like to offer a safe space to them. I'm well aware of the fact that this will most likely not recreate a situation similar to the one back in 2016, as there's a lot more of an age difference between us now which probably means we won't exactly form a friendship, but I've always been working with teenagers and enjoy that a lot. I'm also well aware that they might think I'm a horrible heathen wasting their time and never come back after their first visit, but at the very least I'd have a new fantasy book then :D


So here's some questions I've been asking myself:

* I'm a woman. Are Elders even allowed to visit me while I'm at home alone or should I make sure that a flatmate is also present throughout the visit? Would they need to be in the same room?

* Will my flatmates be affected by me inviting missionaries? Might the missionaries for example try to convert them as well?

* Is it better to talk in English (as I'm quite used to that and consumed all media on the LDS church in English so far, and as that's probably their mother tongue) or in my mother tongue (as they've spent quite some time learning that language and might take pride in using it)?

* Is being open and upfront about my own worldviews and about the fact that my interest in the LDS church is purely theoretical a good idea or might that be a hindrance to further visits?

* I'm queer. Can I talk about that fact and resulting struggles with the church freely/right from the start? (I can deal with queerphobia, just don't want to scare the missionaries.)

* Can I talk openly/ask questions about the ""church secrets"" I've learned about, e.g. about the endowment ceremony, or might that be offensive somehow?

* How careful should I be about criticising the LDS church?

* Do you have any thoughts and ideas on how and when to get away from just ""lessons"" about the LDS church and to a more personal level? Back in 2016, this just seemed to happen organically, but I wonder e.g. about when it's appropriate to ask the missionaries about how they deal with being so far away from their families for such a long time.

* Are there any ""clear lines"" I should draw, such as never going to church with them? Where would you advise me to draw the line exactly and why?

* What's some particular things or gestures that the missionaries might appreciate? I've read about very tight budgets for food and about limited/monitored internet/phone access - is that true? Anything further that comes to your mind?

The quiet moments shared with someone who gets it, the unexpected laughs over a good meal, or just the simple act of being seen and understood. If you appreciate the beauty of those little things, we might be on the same page.

I am 27 years old, M and from England, and while I enjoy staying active through running and hiking, I also find joy in simpler things like baking or trying new recipes. I am someone who values authenticity, respect, and kindness, and I appreciate moments of peace, whether that is over a cup of coffee or while out on an adventure. What I admire in others is honesty and open communication. I am not here for surface-level connections. I want conversations that make you feel truly seen and heard. Mutual respect and empathy are non negotiable for me, and I am looking for someone who values those qualities too.

I also love deep conversations, but I also like light chats or about the little day to day things, whether that is what you had for lunch, your favourite music, or just how your day has been. I am big on genuineness and I really appreciate when someone is authentic in both the big and small moments.

If you are someone who is curious about life, loves to slow down and enjoy the little moments, and values deep, meaningful connections, I would love to hear from you. No expectations, no rush - just two people seeing where this journey takes us. If you bring warmth, authenticity, and a sense of understanding, we might just get along very well :)",1,1739213386.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

They Were Hiding Something Terrifying,"I hadn’t seen my grandparents in years, not since I was a kid, when the long summers at their remote farmhouse felt like a welcome escape from the noise of the city. Now, standing on the gravel driveway with my car engine cooling behind me, the place looked smaller somehow, worn down by time. The house was exactly as I remembered it, tall and slightly sagging, with weathered white paint peeling from the sides. It sat in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by fields and thick woods that seemed to go on forever.

I had taken them up on their offer to visit for a few days. A break was what I needed, I told myself. Things in the city had become overwhelming... work, life, everything. I needed to clear my head, and when Grandma mentioned in one of her letters that they missed having me around, I thought, Why not? It wasn’t like I had anywhere else to be.

As I climbed the porch steps, they were already waiting for me, their familiar faces smiling warmly. Grandma was just as I remembered, her soft gray hair pinned neatly back, her small frame draped in one of her floral aprons. She waved, her eyes crinkling at the corners.

""Well, look at you,"" she said, pulling me into a hug as soon as I reached the top step. ""All grown up. It’s so good to have you back, dear.""

I hugged her back, the smell of lavender and freshly baked bread filling the air. ""It’s good to be back,"" I said, trying to mask the awkwardness. It had been so long, and everything felt... distant.

Grandpa stood behind her, his hands tucked into the pockets of his old work trousers. He nodded in my direction, his smile more reserved. ""About time you visited,"" he said in his low, gravelly voice. ""Your grandmother’s been going on about it for weeks.""

""I know,"" I replied, chuckling softly. ""Sorry it took me so long.""

""Well, you’re here now,"" Grandma said, stepping back and looking me over with a proud smile. ""And that’s all that matters. Come on inside, we’ve got dinner ready.""

I followed them into the house, the door creaking shut behind me. Inside, everything looked almost exactly as I remembered it, the dark wooden floors, the old photographs lining the walls, and the heavy furniture that seemed like it hadn’t moved in decades. It was like stepping into a time capsule, a place untouched by the outside world.

As we moved through the narrow hallway toward the kitchen, something caught my eye in the living room. I slowed my pace, glancing over my shoulder. There, hanging above the fireplace, was the oversized family portrait.

It was a painting I vaguely remembered from my childhood, though I hadn’t thought about it in years. It depicted my grandparents, younger and more vibrant, standing in the center, surrounded by other family members.

Most of them had passed. The colors were faded, and the faces had that old-world, serious look to them, like they were posing for something much more formal than a family portrait.

But one person stood out to me now, someone I didn’t remember seeing before. Toward the back of the group, half-obscured by shadow, was a man I couldn’t place. He wasn’t standing like the others, though, he seemed slightly turned away, as if he were just on the edge of the scene, almost like an afterthought.

""Come on, honey,"" Grandma called from the kitchen, pulling me from my thoughts. ""Dinner’s getting cold!""

I blinked and tore my eyes away from the painting, making my way into the kitchen where the warm glow of the overhead light and the smell of stew greeted me. We sat around the worn wooden table, and Grandma ladled steaming bowls of her homemade stew in front of us.

""It’s been so long since we’ve had you here,"" she said, smiling as she set a plate of bread on the table. ""I hope you’re hungry.""

I nodded, though the strange feeling from the painting still clung to me. ""Yeah, I am. Thanks, Grandma. This smells great.""

We ate in relative silence, the familiar sounds of clinking spoons and soft conversation filling the room. They asked me how life had been in the city, how work was going, and I gave them the usual vague answers. I didn’t want to get into the details of why I really needed a break, how the stress had gotten to me, how everything had started feeling overwhelming. It wasn’t something I was ready to talk about.

After dinner, I found myself wandering back into the living room. I didn’t know why, but I felt drawn to the painting again, like I needed to look at it more closely. There was something unsettling about the way that man in the background was positioned, half-hidden, his face barely visible in the dim light of the room.

I stood there, staring at the portrait for longer than I meant to, trying to figure out if I had just forgotten about him or if something was... different. His expression seemed almost blank, like the others, but there was something in his eyes that unnerved me.

""Everything okay, dear?""

I jumped slightly, turning to see Grandma standing in the doorway with a soft smile on her face. I hadn’t heard her come up behind me.

""Yeah,"" I said quickly, forcing a smile. ""Just looking at the portrait. I don’t remember it that well from when I was a kid.""

She stepped into the room, her eyes flicking to the painting. ""Oh, that old thing,"" she said with a soft chuckle. 

""Who’s the man in the back?"" I asked, pointing to the man. ""I don’t think I recognize him.""

Grandma’s smile faltered for the briefest of moments, but then she recovered, shaking her head lightly. ""Oh, just another relative. He’s always been there."" She looked at me again, her smile a little more forced. ""You probably just don’t remember.""

I nodded, though something about her response didn’t sit right with me. ""Yeah, maybe.""

""Anyway, it’s getting late. You should get some rest,"" she said, her voice gentle but firm. ""It’s good to have you here again.""

I hesitated for a moment, glancing at the painting one last time before turning to follow her. As I made my way down the hall to the guest room, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off about that portrait.

The guest room was small, with an old wooden bed and a heavy quilt draped over it. The room was pristine, almost unnervingly so, as if no one had set foot in it for years. I felt like an intruder, like I didn’t belong there. Still, exhaustion from the long drive took over, and I collapsed into bed, pulling the quilt up around me.

The silence of the house was unsettling. I had forgotten how quiet it could be out here, so far from the city. No traffic, no sirens, no hum of life beyond the walls, just the soft creaking of the house and the distant rustle of the wind through the trees.

Eventually, sleep pulled me under.

The next morning, I awoke to the soft light filtering through the thin curtains of the guest room. The house was quiet, as it always was.

I stretched and got out of bed, the old wooden floorboards creaking under my weight. The room was still as pristine as ever, the air slightly stale, as if it hadn’t been opened up in years. I glanced around, my eyes lingering on the closed closet door. A small shiver crawled up my spine, but I shook it off.

Breakfast was simple... toast, eggs, and coffee. Grandma was already up, bustling around the kitchen with her usual energy, while Grandpa sat quietly at the table, flipping through an old newspaper. They seemed as peaceful as ever. I joined them.

“How did you sleep, dear?” Grandma asked, setting a plate in front of me.

“Fine, thanks,” I replied. “The house is... quiet.”

Grandma smiled. “That’s the charm of the country. You get used to it.”

We ate in relative silence. Grandpa glanced at me over the rim of his coffee mug, his expression unreadable.

After breakfast, I wandered through the house, reacquainting myself with its layout, its old furniture, and the relics of a simpler time. I walked through the narrow hallway that led back into the living room, my steps slowing as I approached the large family portrait above the fireplace.

The man in the back—he’d moved.

I froze in place, my heart skipping a beat as I stared at the painting. I was sure of it. The unknown figure, the man I didn’t recognize, had definitely shifted. He was no longer half-obscured in the background. He had moved closer to the foreground, his shadowy face now clearer. His eyes, dark, almost black, seemed to stare directly at me.

For a long moment, I couldn’t move. I just stood there, staring back at him, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. Had I imagined it? 

I took a step closer, squinting at the portrait. The rest of the people, the ones I recognized as my grandparents and long-dead relatives, hadn’t changed. Their solemn expressions were just as I remembered. But this man, this stranger, was different. His presence in the painting was more pronounced, his face more defined, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was watching me.

I backed away. I turned to leave the room, but my gaze kept flicking back to the portrait. Something about it was wrong, and the longer I looked, the more I felt the weight of the man’s eyes following me.

I found Grandma in the kitchen, humming softly as she wiped down the counter.

“Why don’t you go help your grandfather outside? He could use an extra pair of hands.” Grandma said.

I hesitated, glancing back toward the living room. “Yeah, sure.”

I stepped outside, the fresh air a welcome relief from the oppressive stillness of the house. Grandpa was already in the yard, mending an old fence. He worked quietly, his movements slow and deliberate, as though he were trying to keep himself busy.

I joined him, picking up a hammer and some nails, though my mind was still on the portrait. The man in the painting, his face wouldn’t leave my thoughts. 

For the rest of the day, I helped Grandpa with odd chores around the property, but the feeling of being watched never left me. 

That night, I lay in bed, staring up at the ceiling once again. The silence of the farmhouse had taken on a different tone, one that felt less peaceful and more... expectant. 

I rolled over, my eyes drawn to the closet door at the far end of the room. It was closed, as it had been the night before, but now it seemed different. Ominous, somehow. I tried to ignore it, but a small part of me kept waiting for it to creak open on its own.

The minutes dragged by, and just as I started to drift off to sleep, I heard footsteps.

Soft at first, but unmistakable, just outside my bedroom door.

The footsteps continued, moving back and forth, as if someone was walking up and down the hall. I held my breath, straining my ears to listen. The sound was so faint, but it was there.

I thought maybe it's just one of my grandparents, checking in on me.

They continued, soft but persistent, the sound growing louder the more I focused on it. 

Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore. 

With shaky hands, I threw back the blankets and got out of bed, my feet cold against the wooden floor. I walk toward the door.

The footsteps stopped.

I stood there for a moment, staring at the door, listening to the silence that had suddenly filled the house. My hand hovered over the doorknob, trembling slightly.

I turned the knob and yanked the door open.

The hallway was empty.

No one. Just the dim light from the window at the end of the hall. Everything was still. Nothing moved. The air was thick with an unnatural quiet.

I backed into the room, my pulse racing, and closed the door quickly behind me. My hands were shaking as I leaned against the door.

The footsteps didn’t return, but the unease stayed with me.

The following morning, I woke up with a heaviness in my chest. The previous night’s event clung to me like a fog I couldn’t shake. And as much as I tried to tell myself it was just my imagination, deep down I knew better.

I got dressed and headed into the kitchen, hoping that a simple morning routine might help shake the lingering dread. Grandma was already bustling around the stove, humming softly to herself. The smell of coffee filled the air, and for a brief moment, the farmhouse felt warm and familiar again.

“Good morning, dear,” Grandma greeted me with a smile as I sat down at the kitchen table. “How did you sleep?”

“Fine,” I lied, taking a sip of the hot coffee she set in front of me. 

She smiled, but there was something guarded in her eyes, like she knew more than she was letting on.

I spent most of the day outside, helping Grandpa with small chores. He didn’t say much, as usual, but his silence was oddly comforting. The open space of the farm provided a welcome escape from the unnerving atmosphere inside the house. 

As evening approached, the familiar tension began to settle over me once again. The house seemed to change with the setting sun, becoming heavier, more oppressive.

Dinner that night was quiet. Too quiet. I noticed that the an extra place at the table had been set. An empty chair, a plate, and silverware, perfectly arranged.

“Grandma,” I said slowly, “why did you set an extra place at the table?”

She looked up at me, her expression perfectly calm, but there was a flicker of something in her eyes. “Oh, it’s just an old habit,” she said lightly, as though it was nothing. 

“Even when no one’s here?” I pressed, my voice wavering slightly.

She smiled again, that same tight smile that never quite reached her eyes. “Don’t worry about it.”

I didn’t know what else to say. I glanced at Grandpa, but he didn’t look up from his plate. The silence in the room was suffocating, like a thick blanket draped over everything.

After dinner, I found myself drawn back to the guest room. I was tired, but more than that, I was unsettled. The weight of the house, the eerie stillness, the way my grandparents seemed to dodge every question, it was all becoming too much.

As I lay in bed that night, my thoughts drifted back to the portrait in the living room. I hadn’t dared look at it again after noticing the figure had moved. But the memory of those dark, piercing eyes followed me into the room, watching me even here, in the supposed safety of the guest room.

Just as I felt myself drifting off, I heard the footsteps again. Pacing slowly back and forth outside my bedroom door, just as they had the night before. My heart skipped a beat, and I felt my body tense instinctively.

I lay still, listening. Back and forth. Pacing. Stopping just outside my door, as if waiting for something.

They continued, growing more insistent. I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to will them away, but the sound persisted, and I felt the creeping sensation of someone standing just outside the door.

With trembling hands, I threw back the blankets and stood up, my legs shaking as I approached the door. My heart raced, and my fingers hovered over the doorknob. I hesitated, the memory of the shadow from the night before flashing in my mind.

I turned the knob and yanked the door open.

Nothing.

As I turned, something caught my eye.

The door to the closet in my room, it was slightly ajar.

I swallowed hard, my heart skipping a beat as I slowly backed into the room. I hadn’t opened the closet. I knew that for certain. It had been closed when I went to bed.

Then, I started hearing whispers, faint, almost inaudible, coming from the closet. A soft, unintelligible murmur.

I stared at the closet door, my hands shaking. The whispers grew louder, but I still couldn’t make out the words. They were too muffled, too distant, like they were beckoning me closer.

I didn’t dare move, didn’t dare approach the door. The whispers seemed to press in from all sides, filling the room with their eerie, disembodied voices.

Then, the whispers stopped.

The house fell silent once again, leaving me standing in the dark, trembling, staring at the half-open closet door.

I eventually mustered the courage to approach the closet, and closed the door.

The next morning, I confronted my grandparents.

“Did either of you hear anything last night?” I asked cautiously as we sat around the breakfast table. “Footsteps, or... voices?”

Grandma and Grandpa exchanged a quick glance, their expressions carefully neutral. “Old houses make noises, dear,” Grandma said, her tone light. “You’re probably just not used to the quiet.”

“No,” I insisted, my voice tightening. “I know what I heard. Someone was pacing outside my door. And the closet—”

“It’s nothing to worry about,” Grandpa cut in, his voice firm and unyielding. He glanced at me from across the table, his expression unreadable. “Just keep your door closed at night.”

The tension in the room was thick, and I knew I wasn’t going to get any more answers from them. Whatever was happening in this house, they weren’t going to talk about it.

But I wasn’t imagining things. I knew that now.

Something was happening. And it wasn’t just in my head.

The rest of the day passed in a blur of mundane tasks. I went through the motions, helping Grandpa with jobs around the property, listening to Grandma talk about the weather, the garden, anything except the house and what was happening inside it. But even when I was outside, the air didn’t feel fresh. It felt stifling, as though the weight of the house clung to me, pulling me back, refusing to let me escape its gaze.

By the time evening came around, I was exhausted, physically and mentally. 

Dinner that night was as quiet as ever. The clinking of silverware was the only sound as we ate in near silence. I noticed it again, the extra place setting.

The chair had been pulled out slightly, more than it had been the previous night. The plate was aligned perfectly with the empty seat, the silverware positioned neatly beside it. My heart raced as I stared at the empty chair, the faintest hint of movement catching my eye. It was almost imperceptible, but the chair had shifted, just slightly, as though someone was sitting down.

I blinked, trying to convince myself that I hadn’t seen it. But then the chair moved again.

It wasn’t dramatic. It didn’t slide across the floor or jerk violently. But it shifted,  slowly, as though an invisible presence was adjusting itself, making itself comfortable at the table.

My throat tightened, and I glanced at Grandma and Grandpa, expecting them to notice. But they didn’t react. They kept eating, completely oblivious to the chair’s subtle movement.

“Grandma,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “The chair... it moved.”

She looked up at me, her expression calm and serene. “Oh, dear, it’s just an old chair”

But her words didn’t reassure me. There was something about the way she said it, the casual dismissal, the way her eyes didn’t quite meet mine, that sent a chill down my spine.

I wanted to say more, why they pretended nothing was wrong, but the words caught in my throat. Instead, I nodded weakly and focused on my plate, pretending that everything was fine. But my eyes kept drifting back to the chair, watching for any further movement.

The rest of the dinner dragged on in an agonizing silence. I barely touched my food, my appetite completely gone. 

After dinner, I couldn’t stay in the dining room any longer. I excused myself and retreated to the guest room, my mind racing. I paced the room, glancing nervously at the closet door that had been slightly ajar the night before. It was closed now, but the unease lingered. 

I sat on the edge of the bed, rubbing my temples, trying to make sense of it all. The painting, the strange noises, the chair moving on its own, it was like the house itself was alive.

Just as I started to calm down, I heard it again.

The sound of footsteps.

I waited for the footsteps to stop outside my door, just as they had the previous nights. But this time, they didn’t.

The footsteps kept moving, passing by my door, fading as they traveled down the hall. I stood there, frozen, listening intently. Then, after a long moment of silence, I heard it.

The creak of a chair.

The sound was faint, but unmistakable. 

With trembling hands, I opened the door and stepped out into the hallway. It was dark, the faint moonlight casting long shadows on the floor. My feet were silent against the wooden boards as I made my way toward the dining room.

As I approached, the air grew colder. The faint sound of silverware scraping against a plate reached my ears.

I stopped at the entrance to the dining room, my heart pounding in my chest. I didn’t want to look. I didn’t want to see what was waiting for me at the table.

But I forced myself to step into the room.

The chair, was pulled out completely now.

But no one was there.

Slowly, cautiously, I approached the table. The closer I got, the colder the air became.

My hand shook as I reached out to touch the chair, and the moment my fingers brushed the wood, I felt it.

A breath. Soft and cold, whispering against the back of my neck.

I recoiled, stumbling back from the table, my pulse racing. I turned around quickly, expecting to see someone standing behind me, but the room was empty.

Empty, except for the faint sound of a low, breathy sigh, too close, too real.

I backed out of the room, my heart hammering in my chest, and hurried back down the hallway to the guest room. I closed the door behind me and leaned against it, trying to catch my breath.

I was losing it. That’s what I told myself. I was tired, stressed, and my mind was playing tricks on me. 



The next morning, I couldn’t take it anymore. I confronted my grandparents at breakfast.

“Why do you set that extra place every night?” I asked, my voice tight with frustration. “Why do you pretend nothing’s wrong?”

They exchanged a glance, their faces carefully neutral, but the tension in the room was palpable.

“It’s just the way things are, dear,” Grandma said quietly. “We’ve always done it. Don’t worry about it.”

“But I am worried,” I insisted. “The chair, it's moving. I hear footsteps at night. There’s something here, something you’re not telling me.”

Grandpa finally looked up from his plate, his eyes dark and unreadable. “Some things are best left alone,” he said in a low, gravelly voice. “You don’t need to understand everything.”

I opened my mouth to argue, but the words died in my throat. The look in his eyes was enough to silence me. There was a warning there, a quiet threat that told me I was getting too close to something I wasn’t meant to know.

I pushed my plate away and stood up from the table. I couldn’t sit there any longer, pretending that everything was normal. The house was wrong, the painting was wrong, and my grandparents were hiding something. Something that was growing more dangerous with each passing night.

The unease that had been simmering beneath the surface all week was now a full-blown, suffocating dread. After breakfast, I couldn’t stand being inside the house any longer. I needed to clear my head, to escape the oppressive feeling that something unseen was lurking in every corner, watching my every move.

I spent most of the day outside, wandering the property, but no matter how far I walked, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the house was pulling me back. Like an invisible thread was tugging at my chest, reminding me that I couldn’t escape for long. Eventually, I returned to the farmhouse.

I hesitated at the entrance to the living room, my eyes drawn to the family portrait above the fireplace. My heart sank as I stepped closer.

The man in the portrait.

This time, he was no longer standing in the background, partially obscured by the shadows of the other people. Now, he was at the very front, his face clear and sharp, his eyes fixed directly on me. His expression had changed, too. There was something cruel in the way his lips curled, something dark and malicious in the way he seemed to be staring straight into my soul.

The other people in the painting, my grandparents, their long-dead relatives, had faded even further into the background, their faces barely visible now. It was as though the man had claimed the entire portrait for himself.

I backed away from the painting, my thoughts racing. It wasn’t possible. But I couldn’t deny what I was seeing. The man in the portrait was watching me, and he was getting closer.

I turned to leave the room, my hand shaking as I gripped the edge of the doorframe. But before I could step out, I saw something out of the corner of my eye.

A reflection.

In the large mirror on the opposite wall, I saw him.

The man from the portrait, standing in the doorway, watching me.

I whipped around, my heart hammering in my chest, but the doorway was empty. 

Nothing. No one.

I stumbled back, nearly tripping over the edge of the carpet, my legs shaking as I bolted out of the room. My mind was racing, trying to make sense of what was happening. It was impossible. It couldn’t be real.

I found myself back in the hallway, my back pressed against the wall as I struggled to catch my breath. My eyes darted around, half-expecting to see the man appear again, but the hallway was empty. 

But something else was wrong.

The shadows in the hallway... they didn’t look right.

I glanced down at the floor, my stomach twisting with dread. The shadows cast by the dim light were distorted, stretching out in unnatural ways. The shadow closest to me, the one near the guest room door, was too long, too large.

And then I realized. It wasn’t my shadow.

The shadow stayed where it was, unmoving, as though the figure casting it was standing just behind me, out of sight.

Slowly, I turned.

No one. 

But the shadow was still there, lingering on the floor.

I backed into the guest room, slamming the door behind me, my heart racing. My mind was spinning. I couldn’t make sense of it. I didn’t understand what was happening, or why.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Every creak of the floorboards, every rustle of the wind outside sent a fresh wave of panic through me. The whispers had returned, soft and distant, coming from the closet again. They were louder now, more insistent, beckoning me closer.

I lay there, staring at the closet door, too afraid to move. The whispers were muffled, garbled, like someone was speaking through layers of fabric.

I squeezed my eyes shut, willing the sound to go away. But it didn’t. It grew louder, more urgent.

Finally, I got out of bed and walked toward the closet. My hands trembled as I reached for the door. 

And then, slowly, I pulled the door open.

The closet was empty.

At least, it looked empty.

But the air inside was cold, much colder than the rest of the room. I could feel it, like a faint breath against my skin. I reached inside, my fingers brushing against the old clothes hanging neatly in a row. But something wasn’t right.

The clothes.

They were old-fashioned, worn but somehow still new. I pulled one of the shirts off the hanger, my pulse quickening as I inspected it. It was a man’s shirt, plain but neatly pressed, the fabric stiff as though it had never been worn.

And then it hit me. The clothes looked exactly like the ones worn by the man in the portrait.

I dropped the shirt, stumbling back in horror. My hands shook as I slammed the closet door shut. 

I sat on the edge of the bed, but the room felt smaller, the walls closing in around me. The whispers were gone now, and I forced myself to calm down.

The next morning, I confronted my grandparents again.

“Who is he?” I demanded, my voice shaking. “The man in the portrait. I’ve seen him. He’s here.”

They exchanged another glance, their faces unreadable, but this time, there was something darker in their expressions, something they had been hiding.

Grandma sighed softly, her eyes fixed on the table in front of her. “He’s family,” she said quietly. “He’s always been here.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, my heart pounding in my chest. “Who is he?”

“He’s... one of us,” Grandpa said, his voice low and gravelly. “But he never really left.”

I stared at them, trying to make sense of their words.

Their words echoed in my mind long after breakfast was over: ""He never really left.""

What did that mean? The idea that the man from the portrait was part of the family, always present in some way, sent a cold chill down my spine. I didn’t know what was worse, the idea that my grandparents believed it, or the fact that, after everything I’d seen, I couldn’t bring myself to dismiss it as nonsense.

I spent the rest of the day in a haze, packing my bags, preparing to leave the next morning. I took most of the stuff to my car that evening. 

As the evening sun began to set, casting long shadows across the fields, the oppressive weight of the house became almost unbearable. Every part of me wanted to leave, to get out of that place that night and never return, but something held me there, an invisible pull that I couldn’t shake. The house, the painting, my grandparents, they all seemed to be tied together by something darker, something I hadn’t yet fully understood.

Dinner was quiet, suffocatingly so. My grandparents didn’t say much, and I barely touched the food in front of me. I couldn’t stop thinking about the portrait, about the man who had moved so close to the front, his eyes locking with mine every time I passed by.

I needed to look at it again. To see if something had changed. It was like a compulsion, pulling me back into that living room.

As soon as dinner was over, I slipped away from the table, my feet carrying me almost of their own accord toward the living room. The moment I stepped inside, a cold chill swept over me, freezing me in place for a second. The air in the room felt wrong, as if it were heavier, more stifling than it should be.

I approached the portrait slowly, my heart pounding in my chest. The familiar people were all there, my grandparents, their long-deceased relatives, their solemn faces staring out from the past. But as my eyes moved across the canvas, my stomach dropped.

The man.

He was gone.

My breath hitched, and I stumbled back, my mind reeling. I scanned the portrait again, my eyes searching every corner, every inch of the canvas, but he wasn’t there, and the other people had faded even further into the background, their faces barely discernible.

I stood frozen, my skin crawling with the cold realization that the man had left the painting. The silence of the room pressed in around me, thick and oppressive. 

Suddenly, I had the overwhelming sensation that I wasn’t alone in the room anymore.

I turned quickly, my eyes darting to the doorway, but it was empty. My pulse raced as I took a shaky step back from the portrait, the cold dread settling deep in my bones.

Then I saw something.

A flicker of movement out of the corner of my eye.

At the far end of the hallway, just beyond the faint glow of the light, was a person. He stood still, barely visible in the dim light.

I blinked, my heart pounding in my ears, and he was gone. 

I backed away from the doorway, but as I turned toward the hallway again, I saw him once more.

This time, he was closer.

Standing just a few feet away, his dark eyes fixed on me.

My body locked up in terror, and I stumbled back, unable to tear my eyes away from him. He was tall, much taller than I had imagined, and his features were sharper, more defined, more sinister than they had been in the painting. His skin was pale, almost gray, and his eyes... they were black, bottomless, like they were drawing me in, pulling me toward him.

He took a step closer.

My legs finally responded, and I bolted. I ran out of the living room, down the hallway, my footsteps echoing in the suffocating silence of the house. My mind was a blur of panic, my heart racing as I turned corner after corner.

I reached the guest room and slammed the door shut behind me. The room was dark, the only light coming from the sliver of moonlight slipping through the curtains. The air felt colder in here, thicker.

A cold draft brushed the back of my neck, and I froze. Slowly, I turned my head towards the corner of the room, dread curling tight in my chest.

There he was.

Standing in the corner of the room, just a few feet away. His form was darker now, almost blending into the shadows, but I could see him, looming over me like a predator.

The room seemed to warp around him, the walls shifting and bending as if they were being pulled toward him. He didn’t speak, but I could feel his presence in every inch of the room, pressing down on me, suffocating me with his gaze.

I had to leave. Now.

I threw the door open and ran out of the room, down the stairs, my footsteps loud and frantic in the otherwise silent house. I didn’t stop until I reached the front door, grabing my car keys and stumbling out onto the porch.

The cold night air hit me like a slap, but it wasn’t enough to chase away the terror clawing at my insides.

I stepped out into the yard, gasping for breath, trying to make sense of what had just happened. 

I hopped into my car and as I was about to drive off, I glanced back at the house one last time, and I saw them.

My grandparents.

They were standing on the porch, watching me with unreadable expressions. Their faces were calm, almost serene, but there was something unnerving in the way they looked at me, like they were expecting this. Like they had been waiting for it.

And then, behind them, the man from the portrait.

He stood tall, his dark eyes gleaming in the moonlight. His hand rested on my grandfather’s shoulder, his long, pale fingers curling around him like claws.

They didn’t speak. They didn’t move.

They just watched.

As I drove away from the farmhouse, my hands shaking on the steering wheel, I glanced in the rearview mirror one last time. The house grew smaller in the distance, disappearing into the darkness of the night.



It had been a week since I left the farmhouse.

I hadn’t told anyone what happened. I didn’t know how to explain it, didn’t know if I even believed it myself. The memories felt hazy now, like fragments of a nightmare that refused to leave me. But every time I closed my eyes, I saw him, the man from the portrait, standing there, watching.

I tried to settle back into my life in the city, but nothing felt normal anymore. The sounds of traffic, the crowded streets, they didn’t comfort me like they used to. I felt restless, anxious.

Late one night, as I sat alone in my apartment, staring at the glowing screen of my phone, it rang. The number on the screen was unfamiliar, but something about it tugged at my gut, filling me with an inexplicable sense of dread.

I answered it.

“Hello?” My voice cracked, my hand trembling slightly as I held the phone to my ear.

There was a pause on the other end of the line, a long stretch of silence that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I waited, my breath catching in my throat.

Finally, a voice. Soft, familiar.

“Dear?” It was my grandmother.

My stomach dropped. I hadn’t spoken to her since the night I left, and hearing her voice now, crackling through the phone, sent a cold shiver down my spine.

“Grandma?” I said.

“Yes, dear.” Her tone was calm, almost too calm. “It’s been a while. We were just wondering... when you might come back.”

I swallowed hard, my mouth suddenly dry. “I... I’m not sure. I don’t think—”

“Your room is still ready for you,” she interrupted, her voice soft but insistent. “And the portrait... well, it’s still hanging there. Waiting for you.”

My heart pounded in my chest. I opened my mouth to respond, but no words came out.

Then, in the background, I heard it.

A faint rustling, like someone moving around, adjusting something.

And then a voice, low, deep, and unmistakable.

“I'm waiting.”

It wasn’t Grandpa.

It was him.

The line went dead.

I dropped the phone, my hands shaking as cold sweat broke out across my skin. 

He was still there. And somehow, he had reached out to me.

The man in the portrait wasn’t just a distant relative. He was something else, something tied to this house, to the family. And now, he was trying to claim me.

They Were Hiding Something Terrifying,"I hadn’t seen my grandparents in years, not since I was a kid, when the long summers at their remote farmhouse felt like a welcome escape from the noise of the city. Now, standing on the gravel driveway with my car engine cooling behind me, the place looked smaller somehow, worn down by time. The house was exactly as I remembered it, tall and slightly sagging, with weathered white paint peeling from the sides. It sat in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by fields and thick woods that seemed to go on forever.

I had taken them up on their offer to visit for a few days. A break was what I needed, I told myself. Things in the city had become overwhelming... work, life, everything. I needed to clear my head, and when Grandma mentioned in one of her letters that they missed having me around, I thought, Why not? It wasn’t like I had anywhere else to be.

As I climbed the porch steps, they were already waiting for me, their familiar faces smiling warmly. Grandma was just as I remembered, her soft gray hair pinned neatly back, her small frame draped in one of her floral aprons. She waved, her eyes crinkling at the corners.

""Well, look at you,"" she said, pulling me into a hug as soon as I reached the top step. ""All grown up. It’s so good to have you back, dear.""

I hugged her back, the smell of lavender and freshly baked bread filling the air. ""It’s good to be back,"" I said, trying to mask the awkwardness. It had been so long, and everything felt... distant.

Grandpa stood behind her, his hands tucked into the pockets of his old work trousers. He nodded in my direction, his smile more reserved. ""About time you visited,"" he said in his low, gravelly voice. ""Your grandmother’s been going on about it for weeks.""

""I know,"" I replied, chuckling softly. ""Sorry it took me so long.""

""Well, you’re here now,"" Grandma said, stepping back and looking me over with a proud smile. ""And that’s all that matters. Come on inside, we’ve got dinner ready.""

I followed them into the house, the door creaking shut behind me. Inside, everything looked almost exactly as I remembered it, the dark wooden floors, the old photographs lining the walls, and the heavy furniture that seemed like it hadn’t moved in decades. It was like stepping into a time capsule, a place untouched by the outside world.

As we moved through the narrow hallway toward the kitchen, something caught my eye in the living room. I slowed my pace, glancing over my shoulder. There, hanging above the fireplace, was the oversized family portrait.

It was a painting I vaguely remembered from my childhood, though I hadn’t thought about it in years. It depicted my grandparents, younger and more vibrant, standing in the center, surrounded by other family members.

Most of them had passed. The colors were faded, and the faces had that old-world, serious look to them, like they were posing for something much more formal than a family portrait.

But one person stood out to me now, someone I didn’t remember seeing before. Toward the back of the group, half-obscured by shadow, was a man I couldn’t place. He wasn’t standing like the others, though, he seemed slightly turned away, as if he were just on the edge of the scene, almost like an afterthought.

""Come on, honey,"" Grandma called from the kitchen, pulling me from my thoughts. ""Dinner’s getting cold!""

I blinked and tore my eyes away from the painting, making my way into the kitchen where the warm glow of the overhead light and the smell of stew greeted me. We sat around the worn wooden table, and Grandma ladled steaming bowls of her homemade stew in front of us.

""It’s been so long since we’ve had you here,"" she said, smiling as she set a plate of bread on the table. ""I hope you’re hungry.""

I nodded, though the strange feeling from the painting still clung to me. ""Yeah, I am. Thanks, Grandma. This smells great.""

We ate in relative silence, the familiar sounds of clinking spoons and soft conversation filling the room. They asked me how life had been in the city, how work was going, and I gave them the usual vague answers. I didn’t want to get into the details of why I really needed a break, how the stress had gotten to me, how everything had started feeling overwhelming. It wasn’t something I was ready to talk about.

After dinner, I found myself wandering back into the living room. I didn’t know why, but I felt drawn to the painting again, like I needed to look at it more closely. There was something unsettling about the way that man in the background was positioned, half-hidden, his face barely visible in the dim light of the room.

I stood there, staring at the portrait for longer than I meant to, trying to figure out if I had just forgotten about him or if something was... different. His expression seemed almost blank, like the others, but there was something in his eyes that unnerved me.

""Everything okay, dear?""

I jumped slightly, turning to see Grandma standing in the doorway with a soft smile on her face. I hadn’t heard her come up behind me.

""Yeah,"" I said quickly, forcing a smile. ""Just looking at the portrait. I don’t remember it that well from when I was a kid.""

She stepped into the room, her eyes flicking to the painting. ""Oh, that old thing,"" she said with a soft chuckle.

""Who’s the man in the back?"" I asked, pointing to the man. ""I don’t think I recognize him.""

Grandma’s smile faltered for the briefest of moments, but then she recovered, shaking her head lightly. ""Oh, just another relative. He’s always been there."" She looked at me again, her smile a little more forced. ""You probably just don’t remember.""

I nodded, though something about her response didn’t sit right with me. ""Yeah, maybe.""

""Anyway, it’s getting late. You should get some rest,"" she said, her voice gentle but firm. ""It’s good to have you here again.""

I hesitated for a moment, glancing at the painting one last time before turning to follow her. As I made my way down the hall to the guest room, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off about that portrait.

The guest room was small, with an old wooden bed and a heavy quilt draped over it. The room was pristine, almost unnervingly so, as if no one had set foot in it for years. I felt like an intruder, like I didn’t belong there. Still, exhaustion from the long drive took over, and I collapsed into bed, pulling the quilt up around me.

The silence of the house was unsettling. I had forgotten how quiet it could be out here, so far from the city. No traffic, no sirens, no hum of life beyond the walls, just the soft creaking of the house and the distant rustle of the wind through the trees.

Eventually, sleep pulled me under.

The next morning, I awoke to the soft light filtering through the thin curtains of the guest room. The house was quiet, as it always was.

I stretched and got out of bed, the old wooden floorboards creaking under my weight. The room was still as pristine as ever, the air slightly stale, as if it hadn’t been opened up in years. I glanced around, my eyes lingering on the closed closet door. A small shiver crawled up my spine, but I shook it off.

Breakfast was simple... toast, eggs, and coffee. Grandma was already up, bustling around the kitchen with her usual energy, while Grandpa sat quietly at the table, flipping through an old newspaper. They seemed as peaceful as ever. I joined them.

“How did you sleep, dear?” Grandma asked, setting a plate in front of me.

“Fine, thanks,” I replied. “The house is... quiet.”

Grandma smiled. “That’s the charm of the country. You get used to it.”

We ate in relative silence. Grandpa glanced at me over the rim of his coffee mug, his expression unreadable.

After breakfast, I wandered through the house, reacquainting myself with its layout, its old furniture, and the relics of a simpler time. I walked through the narrow hallway that led back into the living room, my steps slowing as I approached the large family portrait above the fireplace.

The man in the back, he’d moved.

I froze in place, my heart skipping a beat as I stared at the painting. I was sure of it. The unknown figure, the man I didn’t recognize, had definitely shifted. He was no longer half-obscured in the background. He had moved closer to the foreground, his shadowy face now clearer. His eyes, dark, almost black, seemed to stare directly at me.

For a long moment, I couldn’t move. I just stood there, staring back at him, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. Had I imagined it?

I took a step closer, squinting at the portrait. The rest of the people, the ones I recognized as my grandparents and long-dead relatives, hadn’t changed. Their solemn expressions were just as I remembered. But this man, this stranger, was different. His presence in the painting was more pronounced, his face more defined, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that he was watching me.

I backed away. I turned to leave the room, but my gaze kept flicking back to the portrait. Something about it was wrong, and the longer I looked, the more I felt the weight of the man’s eyes following me.

I found Grandma in the kitchen, humming softly as she wiped down the counter.

“Why don’t you go help your grandfather outside? He could use an extra pair of hands.” Grandma said.

I hesitated, glancing back toward the living room. “Yeah, sure.”

I stepped outside, the fresh air a welcome relief from the oppressive stillness of the house. Grandpa was already in the yard, mending an old fence. He worked quietly, his movements slow and deliberate, as though he were trying to keep himself busy.

I joined him, picking up a hammer and some nails, though my mind was still on the portrait. The man in the painting, his face wouldn’t leave my thoughts.

For the rest of the day, I helped Grandpa with odd chores around the property, but the feeling of being watched never left me.

That night, I lay in bed, staring up at the ceiling once again. The silence of the farmhouse had taken on a different tone, one that felt less peaceful and more... expectant.

I rolled over, my eyes drawn to the closet door at the far end of the room. It was closed, as it had been the night before, but now it seemed different. Ominous, somehow. I tried to ignore it, but a small part of me kept waiting for it to creak open on its own.

The minutes dragged by, and just as I started to drift off to sleep, I heard footsteps.

Soft at first, but unmistakable, just outside my bedroom door.

The footsteps continued, moving back and forth, as if someone was walking up and down the hall. I held my breath, straining my ears to listen. The sound was so faint, but it was there.

I thought maybe it's just one of my grandparents, checking in on me.

They continued, soft but persistent, the sound growing louder the more I focused on it.

Finally, I couldn’t take it anymore.

With shaky hands, I threw back the blankets and got out of bed, my feet cold against the wooden floor. I walk toward the door.

The footsteps stopped.

I stood there for a moment, staring at the door, listening to the silence that had suddenly filled the house. My hand hovered over the doorknob, trembling slightly.

I turned the knob and yanked the door open.

The hallway was empty.

No one. Just the dim light from the window at the end of the hall. Everything was still. Nothing moved. The air was thick with an unnatural quiet.

I backed into the room, my pulse racing, and closed the door quickly behind me. My hands were shaking as I leaned against the door.

The footsteps didn’t return, but the unease stayed with me.

The following morning, I woke up with a heaviness in my chest. The previous night’s event clung to me like a fog I couldn’t shake. And as much as I tried to tell myself it was just my imagination, deep down I knew better.

I got dressed and headed into the kitchen, hoping that a simple morning routine might help shake the lingering dread. Grandma was already bustling around the stove, humming softly to herself. The smell of coffee filled the air, and for a brief moment, the farmhouse felt warm and familiar again.

“Good morning, dear,” Grandma greeted me with a smile as I sat down at the kitchen table. “How did you sleep?”

“Fine,” I lied, taking a sip of the hot coffee she set in front of me.

She smiled, but there was something guarded in her eyes, like she knew more than she was letting on.

I spent most of the day outside, helping Grandpa with small chores. He didn’t say much, as usual, but his silence was oddly comforting. The open space of the farm provided a welcome escape from the unnerving atmosphere inside the house.

As evening approached, the familiar tension began to settle over me once again. The house seemed to change with the setting sun, becoming heavier, more oppressive.

Dinner that night was quiet. Too quiet. I noticed that the an extra place at the table had been set. An empty chair, a plate, and silverware, perfectly arranged.

“Grandma,” I said slowly, “why did you set an extra place at the table?”

She looked up at me, her expression perfectly calm, but there was a flicker of something in her eyes. “Oh, it’s just an old habit,” she said lightly, as though it was nothing.

“Even when no one’s here?” I pressed, my voice wavering slightly.

She smiled again, that same tight smile that never quite reached her eyes. “Don’t worry about it.”

I didn’t know what else to say. I glanced at Grandpa, but he didn’t look up from his plate. The silence in the room was suffocating, like a thick blanket draped over everything.

After dinner, I found myself drawn back to the guest room. I was tired, but more than that, I was unsettled. The weight of the house, the eerie stillness, the way my grandparents seemed to dodge every question, it was all becoming too much.

As I lay in bed that night, my thoughts drifted back to the portrait in the living room. I hadn’t dared look at it again after noticing the figure had moved. But the memory of those dark, piercing eyes followed me into the room, watching me even here, in the supposed safety of the guest room.

Just as I felt myself drifting off, I heard the footsteps again. Pacing slowly back and forth outside my bedroom door, just as they had the night before. My heart skipped a beat, and I felt my body tense instinctively.

I lay still, listening. Back and forth. Pacing. Stopping just outside my door, as if waiting for something.

They continued, growing more insistent. I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to will them away, but the sound persisted, and I felt the creeping sensation of someone standing just outside the door.

With trembling hands, I threw back the blankets and stood up, my legs shaking as I approached the door. My heart raced, and my fingers hovered over the doorknob. I hesitated, the memory of the shadow from the night before flashing in my mind.

I turned the knob and yanked the door open.

Nothing.

As I turned, something caught my eye.

The door to the closet in my room, it was slightly ajar.

I swallowed hard, my heart skipping a beat as I slowly backed into the room. I hadn’t opened the closet. I knew that for certain. It had been closed when I went to bed.

Then, I started hearing whispers, faint, almost inaudible, coming from the closet. A soft, unintelligible murmur.

I stared at the closet door, my hands shaking. The whispers grew louder, but I still couldn’t make out the words. They were too muffled, too distant, like they were beckoning me closer.

I didn’t dare move, didn’t dare approach the door. The whispers seemed to press in from all sides, filling the room with their eerie, disembodied voices.

Then, the whispers stopped.

The house fell silent once again, leaving me standing in the dark, trembling, staring at the half-open closet door.

I eventually mustered the courage to approach the closet, and closed the door.

The next morning, I confronted my grandparents.

“Did either of you hear anything last night?” I asked cautiously as we sat around the breakfast table. “Footsteps, or... voices?”

Grandma and Grandpa exchanged a quick glance, their expressions carefully neutral. “Old houses make noises, dear,” Grandma said, her tone light. “You’re probably just not used to the quiet.”

“No,” I insisted, my voice tightening. “I know what I heard. Someone was pacing outside my door. And the closet...”

“It’s nothing to worry about,” Grandpa cut in, his voice firm and unyielding. He glanced at me from across the table, his expression unreadable. “Just keep your door closed at night.”

The tension in the room was thick, and I knew I wasn’t going to get any more answers from them. Whatever was happening in this house, they weren’t going to talk about it.

But I wasn’t imagining things. I knew that now.

Something was happening. And it wasn’t just in my head.

The rest of the day passed in a blur of mundane tasks. I went through the motions, helping Grandpa with jobs around the property, listening to Grandma talk about the weather, the garden, anything except the house and what was happening inside it. But even when I was outside, the air didn’t feel fresh. It felt stifling, as though the weight of the house clung to me, pulling me back, refusing to let me escape its gaze.

By the time evening came around, I was exhausted, physically and mentally.

Dinner that night was as quiet as ever. The clinking of silverware was the only sound as we ate in near silence. I noticed it again, the extra place setting.

The chair had been pulled out slightly, more than it had been the previous night. The plate was aligned perfectly with the empty seat, the silverware positioned neatly beside it. My heart raced as I stared at the empty chair, the faintest hint of movement catching my eye. It was almost imperceptible, but the chair had shifted, just slightly, as though someone was sitting down.

I blinked, trying to convince myself that I hadn’t seen it. But then the chair moved again.

It wasn’t dramatic. It didn’t slide across the floor or jerk violently. But it shifted,  slowly, as though an invisible presence was adjusting itself, making itself comfortable at the table.

My throat tightened, and I glanced at Grandma and Grandpa, expecting them to notice. But they didn’t react. They kept eating, completely oblivious to the chair’s subtle movement.

“Grandma,” I said, my voice barely above a whisper. “The chair... it moved.”

She looked up at me, her expression calm and serene. “Oh, dear, it’s just an old chair”

But her words didn’t reassure me. There was something about the way she said it, the casual dismissal, the way her eyes didn’t quite meet mine, that sent a chill down my spine.

I wanted to say more, why they pretended nothing was wrong, but the words caught in my throat. Instead, I nodded weakly and focused on my plate, pretending that everything was fine. But my eyes kept drifting back to the chair, watching for any further movement.

The rest of the dinner dragged on in an agonizing silence. I barely touched my food, my appetite completely gone.

After dinner, I couldn’t stay in the dining room any longer. I excused myself and retreated to the guest room, my mind racing. I paced the room, glancing nervously at the closet door that had been slightly ajar the night before. It was closed now, but the unease lingered.

I sat on the edge of the bed, rubbing my temples, trying to make sense of it all. The painting, the strange noises, the chair moving on its own, it was like the house itself was alive.

Just as I started to calm down, I heard it again.

The sound of footsteps.

I waited for the footsteps to stop outside my door, just as they had the previous nights. But this time, they didn’t.

The footsteps kept moving, passing by my door, fading as they traveled down the hall. I stood there, frozen, listening intently. Then, after a long moment of silence, I heard it.

The creak of a chair.

The sound was faint, but unmistakable.

With trembling hands, I opened the door and stepped out into the hallway. It was dark, the faint moonlight casting long shadows on the floor. My feet were silent against the wooden boards as I made my way toward the dining room.

As I approached, the air grew colder. The faint sound of silverware scraping against a plate reached my ears.

I stopped at the entrance to the dining room, my heart pounding in my chest. I didn’t want to look. I didn’t want to see what was waiting for me at the table.

But I forced myself to step into the room.

The chair, was pulled out completely now.

But no one was there.

Slowly, cautiously, I approached the table. The closer I got, the colder the air became.

My hand shook as I reached out to touch the chair, and the moment my fingers brushed the wood, I felt it.

A breath. Soft and cold, whispering against the back of my neck.

I recoiled, stumbling back from the table, my pulse racing. I turned around quickly, expecting to see someone standing behind me, but the room was empty.

Empty, except for the faint sound of a low, breathy sigh, too close, too real.

I backed out of the room, my heart hammering in my chest, and hurried back down the hallway to the guest room. I closed the door behind me and leaned against it, trying to catch my breath.

I was losing it. That’s what I told myself. I was tired, stressed, and my mind was playing tricks on me.

The next morning, I couldn’t take it anymore. I confronted my grandparents at breakfast.

“Why do you set that extra place every night?” I asked, my voice tight with frustration. “Why do you pretend nothing’s wrong?”

They exchanged a glance, their faces carefully neutral, but the tension in the room was palpable.

“It’s just the way things are, dear,” Grandma said quietly. “We’ve always done it. Don’t worry about it.”

“But I am worried,” I insisted. “The chair, it's moving. I hear footsteps at night. There’s something here, something you’re not telling me.”

Grandpa finally looked up from his plate, his eyes dark and unreadable. “Some things are best left alone,” he said in a low, gravelly voice. “You don’t need to understand everything.”

I opened my mouth to argue, but the words died in my throat. The look in his eyes was enough to silence me. There was a warning there, a quiet threat that told me I was getting too close to something I wasn’t meant to know.

I pushed my plate away and stood up from the table. I couldn’t sit there any longer, pretending that everything was normal. The house was wrong, the painting was wrong, and my grandparents were hiding something. Something that was growing more dangerous with each passing night.

The unease that had been simmering beneath the surface all week was now a full-blown, suffocating dread. After breakfast, I couldn’t stand being inside the house any longer. I needed to clear my head, to escape the oppressive feeling that something unseen was lurking in every corner, watching my every move.

I spent most of the day outside, wandering the property, but no matter how far I walked, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the house was pulling me back. Like an invisible thread was tugging at my chest, reminding me that I couldn’t escape for long. Eventually, I returned to the farmhouse.

I hesitated at the entrance to the living room, my eyes drawn to the family portrait above the fireplace. My heart sank as I stepped closer.

The man in the portrait.

This time, he was no longer standing in the background, partially obscured by the shadows of the other people. Now, he was at the very front, his face clear and sharp, his eyes fixed directly on me. His expression had changed, too. There was something cruel in the way his lips curled, something dark and malicious in the way he seemed to be staring straight into my soul.

The other people in the painting, my grandparents, their long-dead relatives, had faded even further into the background, their faces barely visible now. It was as though the man had claimed the entire portrait for himself.

I backed away from the painting, my thoughts racing. It wasn’t possible. But I couldn’t deny what I was seeing. The man in the portrait was watching me, and he was getting closer.

I turned to leave the room, my hand shaking as I gripped the edge of the doorframe. But before I could step out, I saw something out of the corner of my eye.

A reflection.

In the large mirror on the opposite wall, I saw him.

The man from the portrait, standing in the doorway, watching me.

I whipped around, my heart hammering in my chest, but the doorway was empty.

Nothing. No one.

I stumbled back, nearly tripping over the edge of the carpet, my legs shaking as I bolted out of the room. My mind was racing, trying to make sense of what was happening. It was impossible. It couldn’t be real.

I found myself back in the hallway, my back pressed against the wall as I struggled to catch my breath. My eyes darted around, half-expecting to see the man appear again, but the hallway was empty.

But something else was wrong.

The shadows in the hallway... they didn’t look right.

I glanced down at the floor, my stomach twisting with dread. The shadows cast by the dim light were distorted, stretching out in unnatural ways. The shadow closest to me, the one near the guest room door, was too long, too large.

And then I realized. It wasn’t my shadow.

The shadow stayed where it was, unmoving, as though the figure casting it was standing just behind me, out of sight.

Slowly, I turned.

No one.

But the shadow was still there, lingering on the floor.

I backed into the guest room, slamming the door behind me, my heart racing. My mind was spinning. I couldn’t make sense of it. I didn’t understand what was happening, or why.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Every creak of the floorboards, every rustle of the wind outside sent a fresh wave of panic through me. The whispers had returned, soft and distant, coming from the closet again. They were louder now, more insistent, beckoning me closer.

I lay there, staring at the closet door, too afraid to move. The whispers were muffled, garbled, like someone was speaking through layers of fabric.

I squeezed my eyes shut, willing the sound to go away. But it didn’t. It grew louder, more urgent.

Finally, I got out of bed and walked toward the closet. My hands trembled as I reached for the door.

And then, slowly, I pulled the door open.

The closet was empty.

At least, it looked empty.

But the air inside was cold, much colder than the rest of the room. I could feel it, like a faint breath against my skin. I reached inside, my fingers brushing against the old clothes hanging neatly in a row. But something wasn’t right.

The clothes.

They were old-fashioned, worn but somehow still new. I pulled one of the shirts off the hanger, my pulse quickening as I inspected it. It was a man’s shirt, plain but neatly pressed, the fabric stiff as though it had never been worn.

And then it hit me. The clothes looked exactly like the ones worn by the man in the portrait.

I dropped the shirt, stumbling back in horror. My hands shook as I slammed the closet door shut.

I sat on the edge of the bed, but the room felt smaller, the walls closing in around me. The whispers were gone now, and I forced myself to calm down.

The next morning, I confronted my grandparents again.

“Who is he?” I demanded, my voice shaking. “The man in the portrait. I’ve seen him. He’s here.”

They exchanged another glance, their faces unreadable, but this time, there was something darker in their expressions, something they had been hiding.

Grandma sighed softly, her eyes fixed on the table in front of her. “He’s family,” she said quietly. “He’s always been here.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, my heart pounding in my chest. “Who is he?”

“He’s... one of us,” Grandpa said, his voice low and gravelly. “But he never really left.”

I stared at them, trying to make sense of their words.

Their words echoed in my mind long after breakfast was over: ""He never really left.""

What did that mean? The idea that the man from the portrait was part of the family, always present in some way, sent a cold chill down my spine. I didn’t know what was worse, the idea that my grandparents believed it, or the fact that, after everything I’d seen, I couldn’t bring myself to dismiss it as nonsense.

I spent the rest of the day in a haze, packing my bags, preparing to leave the next morning. I took most of the stuff to my car that evening.

As the evening sun began to set, casting long shadows across the fields, the oppressive weight of the house became almost unbearable. Every part of me wanted to leave, to get out of that place that night and never return, but something held me there, an invisible pull that I couldn’t shake. The house, the painting, my grandparents, they all seemed to be tied together by something darker, something I hadn’t yet fully understood.

Dinner was quiet, suffocatingly so. My grandparents didn’t say much, and I barely touched the food in front of me. I couldn’t stop thinking about the portrait, about the man who had moved so close to the front, his eyes locking with mine every time I passed by.

I needed to look at it again. To see if something had changed. It was like a compulsion, pulling me back into that living room.

As soon as dinner was over, I slipped away from the table, my feet carrying me almost of their own accord toward the living room. The moment I stepped inside, a cold chill swept over me, freezing me in place for a second. The air in the room felt wrong, as if it were heavier, more stifling than it should be.

I approached the portrait slowly, my heart pounding in my chest. The familiar people were all there, my grandparents, their long-deceased relatives, their solemn faces staring out from the past. But as my eyes moved across the canvas, my stomach dropped.

The man.

He was gone.

My breath hitched, and I stumbled back, my mind reeling. I scanned the portrait again, my eyes searching every corner, every inch of the canvas, but he wasn’t there, and the other people had faded even further into the background, their faces barely discernible.

I stood frozen, my skin crawling with the cold realization that the man had left the painting. The silence of the room pressed in around me, thick and oppressive.

Suddenly, I had the overwhelming sensation that I wasn’t alone in the room anymore.

I turned quickly, my eyes darting to the doorway, but it was empty. My pulse raced as I took a shaky step back from the portrait, the cold dread settling deep in my bones.

Then I saw something.

A flicker of movement out of the corner of my eye.

At the far end of the hallway, just beyond the faint glow of the light, was a person. He stood still, barely visible in the dim light.

I blinked, my heart pounding in my ears, and he was gone.

I backed away from the doorway, but as I turned toward the hallway again, I saw him once more.

This time, he was closer.

Standing just a few feet away, his dark eyes fixed on me.

My body locked up in terror, and I stumbled back, unable to tear my eyes away from him. He was tall, much taller than I had imagined, and his features were sharper, more defined, more sinister than they had been in the painting. His skin was pale, almost gray, and his eyes... they were black, bottomless, like they were drawing me in, pulling me toward him.

He took a step closer.

My legs finally responded, and I bolted. I ran out of the living room, down the hallway, my footsteps echoing in the suffocating silence of the house. My mind was a blur of panic, my heart racing as I turned corner after corner.

I reached the guest room and slammed the door shut behind me. The room was dark, the only light coming from the sliver of moonlight slipping through the curtains. The air felt colder in here, thicker.

A cold draft brushed the back of my neck, and I froze. Slowly, I turned my head towards the corner of the room, dread curling tight in my chest.

There he was.

Standing in the corner of the room, just a few feet away. His form was darker now, almost blending into the shadows, but I could see him, looming over me like a predator.

The room seemed to warp around him, the walls shifting and bending as if they were being pulled toward him. He didn’t speak, but I could feel his presence in every inch of the room, pressing down on me, suffocating me with his gaze.

I had to leave. Now.

I threw the door open and ran out of the room, down the stairs, my footsteps loud and frantic in the otherwise silent house. I didn’t stop until I reached the front door, grabing my car keys and stumbling out onto the porch.

The cold night air hit me like a slap, but it wasn’t enough to chase away the terror clawing at my insides.

I stepped out into the yard, gasping for breath, trying to make sense of what had just happened.

I hopped into my car and as I was about to drive off, I glanced back at the house one last time, and I saw them.

My grandparents.

They were standing on the porch, watching me with unreadable expressions. Their faces were calm, almost serene, but there was something unnerving in the way they looked at me, like they were expecting this. Like they had been waiting for it.

And then, behind them, the man from the portrait.

He stood tall, his dark eyes gleaming in the moonlight. His hand rested on my grandfather’s shoulder, his long, pale fingers curling around him like claws.

They didn’t speak. They didn’t move.

They just watched.

As I drove away from the farmhouse, my hands shaking on the steering wheel, I glanced in the rearview mirror one last time. The house grew smaller in the distance, disappearing into the darkness of the night.

It had been a week since I left the farmhouse.

I hadn’t told anyone what happened. I didn’t know how to explain it, didn’t know if I even believed it myself. The memories felt hazy now, like fragments of a nightmare that refused to leave me. But every time I closed my eyes, I saw him, the man from the portrait, standing there, watching.

I tried to settle back into my life in the city, but nothing felt normal anymore. The sounds of traffic, the crowded streets, they didn’t comfort me like they used to. I felt restless, anxious.

Late one night, as I sat alone in my apartment, staring at the glowing screen of my phone, it rang. The number on the screen was unfamiliar, but something about it tugged at my gut, filling me with an inexplicable sense of dread.

I answered it.

“Hello?” My voice cracked, my hand trembling slightly as I held the phone to my ear.

There was a pause on the other end of the line, a long stretch of silence that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I waited, my breath catching in my throat.

Finally, a voice. Soft, familiar.

“Dear?” It was my grandmother.

My stomach dropped. I hadn’t spoken to her since the night I left, and hearing her voice now, crackling through the phone, sent a cold shiver down my spine.

“Grandma?” I said.

“Yes, dear.” Her tone was calm, almost too calm. “It’s been a while. We were just wondering... when you might come back.”

I swallowed hard, my mouth suddenly dry. “I... I’m not sure. I don’t think...”

“Your room is still ready for you,” she interrupted, her voice soft but insistent. “And the portrait... well, it’s still hanging there. Waiting for you.”

My heart pounded in my chest. I opened my mouth to respond, but no words came out.

Then, in the background, I heard it.

A faint rustling, like someone moving around, adjusting something.

And then a voice, low, deep, and unmistakable.

“I'm waiting.”

It wasn’t Grandpa.

It was him.

The line went dead.

I dropped the phone, my hands shaking as cold sweat broke out across my skin.

He was still there. And somehow, he had reached out to me.

The man in the portrait wasn’t just a distant relative. He was something else, something tied to this house, to the family. And now, he was trying to claim me.

I live in a valley close to a lake in inland Norway. Humidity year round is around 35%. I live on the second floor and there's no basement in the building. There has been no water damage in the building structure / material. Every room has passive ventilation (basically a hole in the wall that I can't close, even in winter). I heat with wood in winter but the wood is stored in an outside unit, not in the same building.

In Norway we take our shoes off when entering the home so I think the Vacuum test is rather valid. I live alone with an indoor cat and I'm housebound and bedbound.

I have a mold doctor but our next appointment is in late March. I don't like him and I have no other doctor options so I'm hoping to get an idea whether I need to move ASAP or not. I have severe ME/CFS since 2023 so moving is unfortunately not an option for me and will cause a possibly permanent worsening of my health.

I did a **Swiffer and a Vacuum ERMI test** to see if there were differences (all tests are taken at the same time in the whole apartment except bathroom and kitchen):

\- Swiffer ERMI score: **24,2**

\- Swiffer HERTSMI score: **34,0** (red)

\- Vacuum ERMI score: **7,7**

\- Vacuum HERTSMI score: **14,0** (yellow)

**Mycotox urine sample shows:**

\- Ochratoxin A (OTA): **37,6** (normal range: <7,5)

\- Mycophenolic acid (MPA): **2,577,96** (normal range: <37,4)

**Inflammatory cytokines anitbodies:**

\- TGFBeta1: 26,561 (normal range: <12,400, optimal range: <6,662)

My goal for now is to get the MPA levels and TGFBeta1 antibody levels down to increase my immunity.

My question is whether a source to my high MPA levels is identifiable? As one of the Penicillium species in my apartment? Perhaps Penicillium Brevicompactum or Chrysogenum, although the levels are not THAT high.

**Sources of MPA may be**: *Water damaged buildings, blue cheese, gorgonzola, barley, flour, baked goods, refrigerated dough, meat, meat products.* ***SPECIES:*** *Penicillium*

**Sources of OTA may be:** *Water damaged buildings, corn, rice, rye, wheat, barley, millet, oats, cereals, raisins, nuts, coffee, cocoa, spices, pork, cheese, cured fish, dried beans, dried fruit, seeds, grapes, fruits.* ***SPECIES***\*: Aspergillus, Penicillium\*

I feel like my OTA level might correspond with food sources, but the MPA level must be from the air since it's so high. Or could I be wrong?

I have lived here for 2,5 years. The elderly owner of the apartment had lots of old furniture and carpets that might have been mold damaged. I threw everything out immediately, but it took me a while to clean the apartment properly.

I feel like the **Swiffer and Vacuum test showing different results might indicate that the source has already been (largely) taken care of. Any insights regarding this?**

For the record I have a HLA-DR gene mutation that makes me susceptible to mold toxicity (and lyme and ME/CFS++).

Thank you in advance for any guidance or tips!!

Was on 5mg for 3 weeks. I went up bc the 5 mg started to “wear off” on day 5. By wear off I mean while I couldn’t eat more than two small meals the food “noise” came back loud and by day 6 I could eat basically ad libdinum which is basically NOT a thing since I started. 

So, I went up to 7.5mg and all was good again. For the first two weeks. Last Saturday (two days ago) was day 6 of week 3 of 7.5mg. And boom! It wore off completely. I literally had a homemmade hot chocolate. Normally the thought of that hot chocolate with the potential sulfur burps indigestion and nasuea would be enough for a “no never”. But something said it would be ok…and it was. 

On the other hand as soon as i dropped the first 25 pounds I have been exercising a lot and vigorously. So i sensed i could handle more calories but i basically wasn’t interested…until two days ago.


So now im looking for advice. Should i go up to 10mg? The first three days of 7.5mg are still pretty rough. Literally a cup of coffee and dinner is all i eat but this wearing off in day 6 is new to me.

Thanks!

EDIT 1 I was on 5mg for 2 months. On week 8 of 5mg is what I meant to type.

She only made me come ONCE. The previous date went similarly.

That was two weeks ago. She don't really initiate texting anymore, she knew I was free this weekend, didn't even tried to make a move to meet again for coffee even.

Mind you, this girl always complained everyone ""used"" her, that no one respected her as a person. She confessed I was the first guy in her entire life who invited her to a proper date--all the rest were guys just calling her for booty call.

I just took my 5th shot. The first 4 weeks I was at 8 now I am at 16.

I don't really have any negative side effects. I drink 96 oz of water a day (give or take). I do not workout but I really should at least go for walks. My job is a desk job.

See my ""Boulders, Rocks, Pebbles"" post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1ilhz8s/decisions_decisions_manybaggers_unite/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) to understand my process here.

For example, I am traveling overseas this week. Here are the details I thought about when making the terrifying decision 🤣 of which bags to bring and what to pack.

What ""modes"" will I be in out of home on this trip?

# Wandering

This is walking around the city touring, shopping, getting in and out of cars, sitting in cafes and restaurants. My family will usually walk 20K+ steps on a day like this. That's about 10 miles. I want minimal weight and bulk.

**Boulders**

* NO MacBook Air 13”: I'll be walking around a ton touring the city.

* NO umbrella. The weather says zero chance of rain
* NO water bottle. This one is controversial for people. I added this to boulders because it's big and heavy and a consideration. Unless I'm walking in warm or hot weather and unlikely to encounter stores, I don't carry water.
* YES puffer jacket. Temperatures in the 50s.

**Rocks**

* YES Portable keyboard (iClever BK08): I may sit in a coffee shop and find the urge to type something.

* NO iPad mini: I'm not eve sure I ever need this thing at all.
* YES Backup Battery: I moved this to rocks because of its size. I think I need to downgrade to a smaller one so it can go back in pebbles.

**Pebbles**

* YES Eyeglass cleaner
* YES Small Pen & paper
* YES Charger, wire
* YES Wallet
* YES AirPods
* NO Keys: It's good I went through this exercise. I'm overseas so there's no chance I'll need my keys. I'll leave them at the hotel.
* YES Miscellaneous (USB-c adapters and such, Splenda, tea bag, flosser, work name tag): While there are things I can leave behind for this specific trip, they all go in one small pouch so the difference is de minimis

**Summary** Based on the above decisions, I'll take my [Tom Bihn Side Effect](https://www.tombihn.com/products/side-effect?variant=44706262778045) and just tie my jacket around my waist if needed. Had I needed my umbrella and/or a water bottle, I would upgrade to the [Tom Bihn Side Kick](https://www.tombihn.com/products/side-kick?variant=42928400433341) (this, btw is the sling I use the most. So if I had to get just one, I'd get this). If I needed my laptop, I'd need a 3-way briefcase/large sling. But then, I'd be in Wandering Work mode and not Wandering.

# Wandering Work

There are some mornings I'd like to wake up early, walk to a cafe, sit and get some work done. It's not a long distance and I'll be able to go back to the hotel before Wandering the rest of the day.

**Boulders**

* YES MacBook Air 13”: there are websites and apps for work that just don't work well in iOS

* NO umbrella. The weather says zero chance of rain
* NO water bottle. This one is controversial for people. I added this to boulders because it's big and heavy and a consideration. Unless I'm walking in warm or hot weather and unlikely to encounter stores, I don't carry water.
* YES puffer jacket. Temperatures in the 50s.

**Rocks**

* NO Portable keyboard (iClever BK08): I have my laptop. Before using this decision process I would have just taken it along without thinking.

* NO iPad mini: Again, WTF? 🤷🏻‍♂️ I never seem to need this.
* No Backup Battery: I'll have my charger and wire and will be sitting in a cafe that likely has an outlet and I won't be there long enough to run out of charge (remember to bring an adapter! This country is 220V!).

**Pebbles**

* YES Eyeglass cleaner
* YES Small Pen & paper
* YES Charger, wire
* YES Wallet
* YES AirPods
* NO Keys: It's good I went through this exercise. I'm overseas so there's no chance I'll need my keys. I'll leave them at the hotel.
* YES Miscellaneous (USB-c adapters and such, Splenda, tea bag, flosser, work name tag)

**Summary** Based on the above decisions, I'll take my **Aer Travel Sling 2**. I can fit my puffer in there too. In the past I would have shoeved my entire Side Effect or Side Kick into my sling, because ""Hey! I have the room!"" But now, I'll pull out the pebbles and put them into the organization in the Aer Travel Sling 2. Most of the pebbles are in little pouches anyway which makes it easy:

* [Tom Bihn Ghost Whale Organizer Pouch, Small](https://www.tombihn.com/products/ghost-whale-organizer-pouch?variant=44660787675325)
   * Eyeglass cleaner and cloth
   * Pens
   * Binaca (love it. Totally 80s. Gets a laugh every time I use it.)
* [Topo Design Accessory Bag, Micro](https://topodesigns.com/products/accessory-bags-3?variant=44317388374069)
   * All the miscellaneous stuff
* [Tom Bihn Ghost Whale Organizer, Mini](https://www.tombihn.com/products/ghost-whale-organizer-pouch?variant=14178450538559)
   * Small Charger block
   * Charging Wire
   * Oura ring charger (this one would be coming along for the ride because it's too small to bother taking out)

# Travel Mode

The last mode I'll be in is Travel Mode. We're flying to our destination. We rarely bring any checked suitcases. Our family of 5 spend three weeks in europe and we each fit in a backpack and carry-on suitcase. We pack abd out 7-10 days worth of clothing and do laundry on our trip. We did a month in Africa each with a backpack and [small North Face Base Camp Duffel](https://www.thenorthface.com/en-us/bags-and-gear/luggage-and-duffels/duffel-bags-c224547/base-camp-duffels-(50l)-pNF0A52ST?color=4WP). I rock a [tango-red Away Carry-on Flex](https://www.awaytravel.com/suitcases/carry-on-flex?color=tango_red).

Here, I won't go through the whole decision tree. I started with the clothing and toiletries I needed and ended up with some extra room. I packed a Tom Bihn Side Hustle and Side Effect in there.

I went to the airport with my packed out Side Kick *inside* my Aer Travel Sling 2. All the boulders, Rocks, and Pebbles in there. My suitcase rolls and the sling has a luggage passthrough so nothing goes on my shoulders.

Sey: clear, light, and acid forward. The champagne listed in the tasting notes was very accurate for me. If I see this become available again I'll buy another bag.

B&W: The more developed roast profile was more pronounced than I expected. I realize Sey is known for particularly light roasting, but I was still surprised. Along with the roastyness the black tea flavor was most prominent in my cup. The body was pleasantly light. Not a repurchase for me. 

My take away here is that for delicate washed coffees Sey is my preference. As for B&W I'll probably pick up a 100g bag of their weird/funky stuff from time to time but for more traditional beans I don't think I'll be shopping with them. 


Brewing was done in Chemex with third wave water, light roast blend. 20g beans to 320g water. Water off boil, 60g bloom (settled on 60s for the B&W and 90s for the Sey) and single pour for the remainder, two swirls no stirring. Grind size I ended up with the Sey being slightly more coarse.

**Sup homies?!**

Let’s talk about religion for a minute. Not the feel-good, “God is love” version—nah, I mean let’s take a real look at it. See, if someone walked up to you on the street and said, *“There’s an invisible voice watching my every move, judging me, commanding me to obey or suffer eternal damnation,”* you’d probably take a step back and slowly reach for your phone to call someone who could *help* them.

But if that same person is wearing a priest’s robe or standing behind a pulpit? Suddenly, they’re ***enlightened***. That, my friends, is the **greatest PR trick of all time.**

Now, let’s break this down logically, because when you start lining up religious belief next to the diagnostic criteria for **schizophrenia**, things get real interesting. According to the **DSM-5**, schizophrenia is diagnosed by the presence of ***specific*** symptoms. And if we look at these symptoms *objectively*, well… let’s just say a whole lot of churches start looking like group therapy sessions where nobody’s taking their meds.

**Hallucinations – The Voice That Never Shuts Up:**

The biggest telltale sign of schizophrenia? *Hearing voices that aren’t actually there.* Sound familiar? Because in religion, hearing voices is a *requirement*. God, the Devil, angels, spirits—everybody’s got something to say.

\- You hear a voice commanding you to build a boat big enough to fit two of every animal? That’s **divine inspiration.**

\- You hear a voice telling you to walk into traffic because the light of heaven awaits? **Schizophrenia.**  
See the difference?

 No? 

*Exactly.*

**Delusions of Grandeur – I’m Special Because… God Said So!:**

Now, another core symptom of schizophrenia is **delusions of grandeur**, where a person believes they have some special connection to a higher power.

Religion tells people, *“You are chosen! You are made in God’s image! The Creator of the Universe has a personal plan just for you!”*

Bruh. That’s like believing Jeff Bezos designed Amazon just so *you* could get free shipping. You really think the infinite intelligence behind galaxies, black holes, and quantum mechanics is personally invested in whether you eat pork on Fridays? Sounds a little *self-important*, don’t you think?

# Disorganized Thinking – Prayer Ain’t a Conversation, It’s Rambling

Ever listen to someone pray out loud? It’s a mess. *“Dear God thank you for this day please bless my family forgive me for my sins help my cousin get outta jail, also I need rent money also please cure my knee pain oh oh and help the starving children but mostly pay my rent—Amen.”*

There’s no structure, not a damn comma in sight, no feedback, no real conversation happening. Just a one-sided wishlist, thrown into the void.

Now, imagine someone talking like that *without* religion—just pacing back and forth, mumbling to themselves about their problems and expecting an unseen force to fix everything. You’d assume they need help. But call it prayer, and suddenly it’s normal? (to be fair, I pace back and forth and talk to myself constantly - but I'll be the first to admit I'm a fuckin' lunatic!)

# Paranoia – The Ultimate Surveillance State:

Ever heard someone say, *“God is watching everything you do”*?

That’s not comforting—that’s straight-up terrifying. If someone told you the government planted a microchip in their brain to track their every thought and punish them for disobedience, you’d call them a paranoid schizophrenic conspiracy nut. But slap the name “God” on that microchip, and suddenly it’s faith?

Bruh, the ***""Divine Counsel""*** must be the **biggest surveillance system in existence.** Worse than the NSA. Worse than Big Brother. At least our phones show us targeted ads with or without our consent.... Meanwhile, God’s out here logging *every* thought, *every* action, *every* desire, and if you step outta line? Eternal torture.

That ain’t faith. That’s psychological warfare.

Gross...

# Bizarre Behavior – Holy Rituals Ain’t That Different From Compulsions:

Let’s talk about rituals. You ever seen someone go through obsessive-compulsive disorder? Repetitive actions, symbolic gestures, an overwhelming fear of what will happen if they *don’t* perform them? Now, take a step back and look at religious traditions:

\- Dunking babies into water like a donut into coffee and calling it cleansing sins?

\- Sunday Aerobics (standing, kneeling, sitting. standing, kneeling, sitting.)  Church is just as much a physical exercise as it an indoctrination snooze fest.

\- and then there's the consuming semen, hymen blood and even aborted fetuses (looking at you Borborites!)  Even if we dilute it to today's much tamer version, eating a cracker and calling it the flesh of Jesus, and drinking wine and pretending its his blood - **its fucking bizarre, okay?**

You take these actions *out* of a religious setting, and they start looking ***real*** concerning. But in a church, that shit is sanctified! 

**So what’s the conclusion?**

Simple: religion is ***socially acceptable schizophrenia****.* It takes symptoms that would otherwise be considered a mental disorder and rebrands them as ""Faith"", ""Tradition"", and ""Divine Connection"". The only difference between a guy ranting on the street about voices in his head and a priest doing it from the pulpit? **Marketing. 1500 years, of marketing...**

At the end of the day, believe what you want. But let’s be real—if God actually wanted to communicate with us, you’d think It would come up with something a little more reliable than *delusional episodes and whispered ramblings...*

	•	The worst: He filled my shampoo bottle with Nair. Thankfully, I noticed before I ended up looking like a peeled egg.

I’ve told him to chill so many times, but he just laughs and says, “It’s just a prank, bro!”

Anyway, last week, I decided I’d had enough. I waited until Todd was half asleep and swapped his morning coffee creamer with heavy-duty laxative. (Doctor-approved dose—I’m not a monster.)

Cut to an hour later: Todd sprints out of his room like he’s in an Olympic event. Five minutes in, he realizes something is very wrong. Thirty minutes in, he’s still in the bathroom, screaming my name like I’m an exorcist.

When he finally emerges, pale and trembling, I just shrug. “It’s just a prank, bro.”

Now he’s furious, saying I “took it too far” and that “his body will never be the same.” But suddenly, I’m the bad guy?!

So, AITA? Or did Todd finally get what he deserved?",1,1739211417.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

I was at a youth coffee shop that I go to often to play the keyboard. I’m really close with one of the workers there and we were talking about stuff and at one point he asked me if I knew this girl and she’s my classmate. I said yeah and stuff and that’s it. Today at school I saw her in the hall and it looked like she was looking at me, but I don’t really know because of the glare in her glasses. I really hope I’m not in trouble or anything, I really don’t need any more embarrassing moments. I know I did nothing wrong, I didn’t say anything about her or anything like that. All of this could be in my head. Oh, I forgot to mention the fact that she works there now.",3,1739211099.0,teenagersbuthot,10,1.0,False
