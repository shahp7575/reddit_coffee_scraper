1oo869e,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1oo869e/heavy_tw_self_chosen_end/,Heavy tw - (self chosen end),"Sunday into Monday night somebody ended themselves behind a coffee shop in my jobs strip mall and were found early hours. 

A worker for the next shop over came in and I asked if he heard about it and he said ""yeah its crazy out there. Did you hear snap people didnt get anything for november?"" And i replied ""-name-, hon, thats very possibly WHY he made that choice"" 

""Oh come on, thats over dramatic nobody is doing that over loss of food stamps"" 


I had to simply lay out that our nearest food pantry is 7 miles away, no sidewalks, the temp is dropping quickly, its been wet and nasty the last few days, and if you are homeless with no fridge no microwave no ANYTHING you are literally walking into a store, grabbing what you will eat that second, and eating it as is in most cases. If you have no home you cant store the 2 weeks of heavy groceries they send you with at a pantry, even if you could find a ride. 

Honestly I think I just needed to vent about the lack of awareness I guess with others who understand what actual hunger is and why it isnt so ""over dramatic "" to choose an instant finish over slow end that is a toss up between freezing or starving and which one will get you first.

1oo83ln,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oo83ln,Hiked the Tahoe rim trail,"Just wrapped up a 3-day/2-night fastpack of a section of the TRT last week. Building toward eventually completing the entire loop in one push. I covered roughly 19 miles per day for a total of 58.7 miles--absolutely incredible experience and quite the undertaking. Conditions were perfect and the scenery was stunning throughout.  
  
Route: Started at Brockway Summit Trailhead (39.25851, -120.06443) and got picked up on Kingsbury Grade (38.97362, -119.89871). Stayed on the TRT for the most part, with a few detours for water access and side trips to peaks/viewpoints.  
  
Key Gear:

* KETL Mtn Blackwood Trail Run Shorts and NoFry Sun Hoodie - Lightweight, incredibly breathable sun protection that dries fast
* Pa'lante v2 Pack - Perfect size and weight for a 3-day trip like this 
* Black Diamond Distance Carbon Z trekking poles - Light, durable, and collapse into thirds 
* Norda 01 Shoes - Ideal cushioning for long days with a bomber dyneema upper. Fit my feet well 
* Meal2Go bars - Excellent calorie-to-weight ratio. Easy to eat on the move
* Smith Wildcat photochromic sunglasses - Versatile enough for all-day wear 
* Hydrapak Flux 1.5L with filter cap - Simple, reliable water filtration and carrying system  

Sleep System: Kept it pretty minimal, brought a 20F quilt, lightweight inflatable pad, and a basic tarp shelter. Temps dropped into the low 40s at night but stayed comfortable. Typically stopped hiking around 7-8pm, set up camp quickly, and was back on trail by 6:30am after coffee and breakfast.  

Highly recommend any section of this trail. Well-marked, easy to navigate, frequently has cell coverage, and plenty of water sources and road crossings if you need to bail.

The MM delivers the water in 4:45. Basket is new, using Moccamaster #4 filter.

I started with 80g of beans (not quite 1:16) at 9, then 10, then 11 on the Ode2.  At 11 the basket takes over 6:30 to drain which is +30 seconds long. And, I would really like to add another 10g of beans.

This seems odd, to me with the grinder set all the way to 11 which is 2 ABOVE the suggested range for drip.

Also, when I turn the dial down to 1 the burrs do not chirp. So, this tells me the grinder is already set a bit coarse.

I’d take slow, deep breaths whenever I felt anxious or overwhelmed. It worked, but what surprised me even more was how powerful breathing became for focus.

Before starting a busy workday, I now take one minute to breathe in a bit deeper and quicker than usual, then slow down again. This little shift wakes up my body without the jittery feeling coffee gives. It’s like switching on my brain in a calm way.

It reminded me that breathing isn’t just for relaxation it’s also how we regulate our energy. By tuning into it, we can move between calm and alert whenever we need to.

1oo7wwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/FatSciencePodcast/comments/1oo7wwi/calorie_density/,Calorie Density?,"Recently discovered this podcast and slowly working my way through the catalog of back episodes, but so far I have never heard a discussion of calorie density. 

I’ve been on a GLP-1 med since April. While my standard lipid panel and A1c all looked excellent, my weight was obese and my BP was creeping up. I unfortunately have extremely high Lp(a), a genetically determined and independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. I did not find out until I was in my early 50s (early 60s now) and I do have atherosclerotic heart disease.  So my PCP was happy to write me Rx for GLP-1 to really give weight loss a go before putting me on BP meds.   I have never been one to follow fad diets, and I hate measuring and tracking calories.  But I do gain weight extremely easily and have focused on whole plant foods, minimally processed and full of fiber, low in fat most my adult life to manage that (beans, whole grains, fruit and veggies).   I feel like if I ate a SAD diet I would be very, very overweight.   I do think I have damaged my metabolism from almost two decades of working out in the mornings in a fasted state.  I think the GLP-1 is helping repair that, along with eating before work outs, but my insurance or PCP not able to monitor my metabolism the way Dr. Cooper does.  I’ve lost almost 20 pounds and now in overweight category and my BP normal. 



I believe CICO is a flawed model, but I just got back from a weeks vacation with extended family. I allowed myself a little more freedom: unsweetened soy milk in my coffee, a piece of birthday cake, a piece of sourdough bread with olive oil, one lite beer, one piece of halloween candy, some macadamia nuts , vegan butter in mashed potatoes  Nothing excessive.  But I was so disappointed to see I gained almost 5 pounds.  It took me two months to loose that 5 pounds before vacation as I am losing about half pound a week.  I know we are not supposed to demonize healthy fats, but when I add fats back into my diet or any higher calorie dense foods even in reasonable small portions, I just start gaining.   



Okay to my question: at a certain point calories do seem to matter, yes or no?    I’m turning 65 soon and  transition to Medicare and GLP-1s won’t be covered so I am preparing myself for that transition. Without the appetite control of the meds I will have to watch calories….which for me the easiest way to do that is pay attention to calorie density and stay way from cheese, fatty proteins, nuts, avocado, oils and sweets (which always have fats in them, not just sugar).  My cardiologist wants me to keep eating a Whole Foods plant based diet. It’s a pattern of eating just like Mediterranean or Nordic diets.  Luckily that does seem well suited to me, as I never found fats to be satiating and I love the diversity of flavors in a plant based diet.   I know every one is unique and can be healthy on different patterns of eating, but the mindset of allowing reasonable treats like Andrea suggests (bring back that bread basket and butter!) always backfires for me and my genetics and brain.  Sorry if these topics covered in a podcast I have yet to listen too (please mention the title if so, will listen immediately). Thanks.",1,1762264888.0,FatSciencePodcast,0,1.0,False

It was successful, empowering, and really helped to prioritize my goals. Getting excited by that motivation, I stopped after 2 months thinking I was good to maintain. 

As it turns out, building new habits is not so easy! 😝 Here I am two months later with a lingering heavy credit card balance, impulse habits back, and no savings. It’s not totally negative, though. I had unexpected car issues, vet visits, etc. that were costly. And fortunately, because of my efforts the previous two months, I could afford these things easier without putting myself tooooo much further in the hole. 

Once I had another CC balance though, the ‘fuck it’ mentality stepped in. I treated myself to a bunch of nonessentials out of stress and the fact that the CC had a balance anyway, so what’s a couple of extra hundreds? (I know, I know). Returning what I can. 

So, here’s my outline. Slightly revised from the previous challenge based off of what I learned/struggled with. I’ll be checking in each day (forreal this time) to keep myself accountable! Please feel free to comment, check in, and share your own experiences. ☺️🤍

(The see-saw pattern is because sometimes my long runs would get pushed into the next week on Monday, but generally things averaged out.)

I've been running on and off for years, but I've been very inconsistent.  I trained for a half marathon last in 2023 (completing it in 1:33), and since then would have bouts of running but never establishing a solid base.  I would also regularly get injured when running - usually ankle or knee pain.  At one time I had to take a few weeks off running due to achilles and peroneal tendinosis (never a stress fracture).

I would say I really starting making my running consistent in March, and kicked off the Hal Higdon Intermediate 1 plan in the early summer.  I chose this plan because it seemed accessible given my mileage and injury-prone history.  I also did not run any of the workouts at race pace to try to avoid stressing out my ankles.  My runs generally hovered around 8:15-8:45 per mile pace.

Even though my training was very conservative, I still unfortunately managed to hurt my ankles.  After my 17 mile run, I decided to enroll in PT for ankle strengthening.  This was really helpful and kept me going.  A few days after my 20 mile run however, my ankles totally gave out and I had to take a full week off of running (I couldn't jump at all, and would limp when I walked). This, combined with the flu, meant that I totally skipped the last serious week of the training plan including the second 20 mile run.

By miracles, the rest and recovery worked, and my ankles were back to usable by late October.  I added a few miles to the last 12 mile long run to make it 16 miles, and then started my taper.

My final thoughts here: the training was definitely not challenging me to my cardio potential, but my ankles were always teetering on the edge of collapse.  I am going to continue to do ankle strengthening in PT as I return to base building. I really think that it will make a world of difference and let me actually train to my potential.

# Pre-race

Unfortunately, I was one of the people that narrowly made it to my corral in Wave 1 due to the midtown bus situation.

I woke up at 3:30, arrived to midtown by 5am where I waited until 6:30am to get on a bus.  We arrived around 8am, greeted by a massive security line.  Luckily, people let me through once they realized that I was in Wave 1.  I got through security at 8:30am, and bee-lined to my corral about 10 minutes before it closed.  Luckily I still had time to use the porta potty and do everything I needed to, but the only warmups I could get in were some ankle stretches that I did on line.

An incredibly stressful situation, but we managed!

NYC and its crowd is really amazing, I don't think I have to repeat here what everyone already knows :)  I probably high fived like a hundred kids during the course, and I caught so many friends that had come out to cheer for me.

Given my sub-optimal training, I was one of those people that went in without a really good picture of what I should/could do.  Strava and Runalyze were both predicting times > 3:40, but based on my half marathon time I truly felt that this would be an underachievement.  I decided to wear the 3:15 effort pace band, but quickly found that this was probably going to be a little too ambitious and pivoted toward a 3:20 goal.  I tried not to stress about it too much during the race, just focusing on keeping good effort without overdoing it.

The race for me was, luckily, largely uneventful.  I found myself feeling consistent pretty much throughout the race.  The bridges were unsurprising, and not particularly difficult given the frequency of training on bridges that I had done.  I will say that the Bronx crossing was probably the most surprisingly challenging, but manageable.

The 5th avenue hill did indeed suck. I found myself holding it together but unable to really summon the energy to push myself toward the end.

# Nutrition

Nutrition was an incredibly important element to me, and I think my preparation is what helped me avoid hitting the wall on this run.

For the three days prior to the race (starting Thursday), I carb loaded according to Featherstone Nutrition's calculator.  Based on my body weight, it had me eating about 600g of carbs per day.  This usually took the form of 2 NYC-sized bagels with jam, pasta or Mac n Cheese, pop tarts, fruit juice, and whatever else I was feeling that day.  I probably had like 250g of sugar each day, which my teeth were definitely feeling by day 3.  I reduced the amount of fat and protein I ate significantly to try to keep my caloric surplus as low as possible, but I wasn't militant about it.

I was feeling a little bloated throughout the carb load, but I made sure not to eat after 6pm on race evening.  By Sunday morning, I was feeling pretty good, and full of energy.

On Race morning, I stuck to my usual pre race meal - a double espresso and a bagel with cream cheese and jam.   My intention was to have a second bagel at the village, but stuck on the bus and realizing that I wasn't going to make it, at 7:30am I dug into a Honey Stinger energy waffle that I had brought with me.

In the corral, I had a SIS coffee gel (lots of caffeine). During the race, I had a gel every 20 minutes.  This is something I had been practicing during training runs - successively decreasing the amount of time between gels on each run until I was able to handle one every 20-25 minutes.  I mostly stuck to Maurten and Huma, which were my favorites during training.  I was getting a little stick of the gels toward the end of the race, but I never hit any cramps or GI issues.

# Post-race

What a feeling! My calf was cramping a bit, so I stopped by the medical tent where they gave me some electrolytes and a quick massage.  I went home, changed, met my friends for beer, and honestly felt pretty decent for the rest of the day all things considered :)

The next day, I signed up for the Chicago and Berlin marathon lotteries.  I'm ready to see what I can really do!

Sounds empowering. But it's incomplete.

Reality check: Some people can't be cut off. Family. Colleagues. Your community. They're woven into your daily life whether you want them there or not.

At first, I resented this. Then I discovered something better than cutting people off—**strategic boundaries.**

**My system:**

People aren't good or bad. They're good *in certain contexts* and bad in others.

* That cousin? Great at parties. Terrible with secrets.
* That coworker? Brilliant collaborator. Exhausting friend.
* That old friend? Generous with time. Forgetful with money.

I once lent money to someone I genuinely liked. He never paid it back. Instead of ending the friendship, I simply moved him to a different category: someone I'll grab coffee with, but never do business with.

**Think of relationships like a house:**

Some people belong in the living room. Some in the guest room. Some stay on the porch. And yes, some don't get through the gate at all.

The goal isn't to let everyone in or keep everyone out. It's to know **where each person belongs.**

Cutting people off is easy. Creating sustainable boundaries is wisdom.

Disclaimer: True narcissists and abusers need to be removed. But most people? They just need the right distance.

**Bottom line:** Peace doesn't come from having fewer people. It comes from positioning the right people in the right places.

(Noob!),"This is my son's truck. It was very cheap (Eur 9.99), but as he's getting more and more into RC cars, I want to learn to maintain them properly. Ideally before he's starting to play with bigger and more expensive ones.

I understand small and cheap RC cars are not made for eternity, but this little car (1:64 scale) broke down **after just one day of fairly gentle use**. The wheels began to get stuck regularly and only a little push would get the truck moving again

I opened up the motor to check what happened and I saw that two of the teeth/cogs? of one of the gears had broken off:

This seems like pretty extreme wear for just 1 day of use, even for a very cheap toy.

Is there anything my son could have done to cause this? Yes, it did fall down a little coffee table, but that was on carpet and just a few centimeters. He drove it very normally, I would say. Especially for something that's sold as a ""*Monster Truck*"".

What I'd like to understand:

* **Are these gears standardised and can I order them online?** Even if it doesn't make sense economically, I think it would be a nice exercise for us to repair it together.
* **Does this seem like excessive wear/a quality issue or is it just a gamble with cheap toys?**
* **Anything my son could do to prevent this from happening to his next RC car?**

Any ideas are great, but here's probably what I'm really asking from someone whose coffee maker is working fine (to see if ours is abnormal):

1.  With your unit on, and the drip tray dry, if you brew 2 7.4oz coffees, how much water is in the drip tray afterwards?
2. When your coffee maker is dry, and you brew coffee, how much condensation do you see behind the brew group (near boiler pin)?  I understand a teeny bit is normal, but I see more.  (see [https://imgur.com/a/qVNtecg](https://imgur.com/a/qVNtecg) )



**More information and background:**

* yes, we've done all maintenance (decalc, brew group cleans, unit cleans, filter replacement, etc).  we did see SOME improvement after descale, but I still suspect an issue.
* system was calibrated to correct volume at some point, and has been used regularly for 5 years.
* sometimes we get better results, sometimes worse (without cleaning/adjustment) - so it's a little variable in output.
* i removed the boiler pin and it (and the o rings) seem to be in ok shape.  Might order one anyway \[comes with new o rings as well\], but am trying to get more info before I do.
* in my test, I brewed 2 7.4oz cups of coffee.  The result: 13oz coffee (not bad, but); 3oz liquid in drip pan

We are a safe, supportive group, by women, for All Women, of All Paths, Always- and I invite you to join us! Being a ""Witch"" isn't required, just a willingness to support other women on their Spiritual path. We have monthly meetups, bonfires, women's circles, and more! The age range of our members is anywhere from 18-75 (!!) and our goal is to become a proper third space within the city by the end of next year. I hope you'll check us out!

As a small business owner in the Spiritual Community, I saw the need for this group and started it a little over 2 years ago. We've grown from a handful of girls to almost 1k!

I own [Nocturne Tarot](https://www.nocturnetarot.com) in Pleasant Ridge, but offer more than Tarot Readings: I teach individual and group classes on how to Read the cards, along with a variety of other services, including: Occult Philosophy, Akashic Record Reading, Dark Feminine Reclaimation, Mediumship, and Mentorship (in Intentional Work, Witchcraft, and Therapeutic Art).

I Love what I do, and feel it's a deep calling to work with and help other people along their path. I'm not a replacement for therapy, but I've worked hard to achieve my accreditations to be a sort of Spiritual BFF (I detest the term ""life coach"" 😩).

I invite you to have a look at my website and [offerings ](https://www.nocturnetarot.com/nocturne-tarot-spiritual-mentorship) and reach out for some conversation and maybe a coffee and [consultation](https://nocturnetarot.youcanbook.me/)!

so here's the hot tea

--------------------------

I submitted my first student visa application on August 22, with a planned departure date of September 16. Not anticipating any complications, I had already rented accommodation and purchased my flight ticket in August. On August 26, I received a message that my application had entered the consulate, along with an email from the consulate requesting clarification about my course details. I replied on the same day.

Starting from September 1, as my departure date approached, I sent multiple follow-up emails (on September 1, 5, and 11) to inquire about my visa progress. None of them received a reply.

On September 15, the day before my scheduled flight, I went to the consulate in person due to the lack of any response. The receptionist made two phone calls, then told me, “You are applying for a D-type visa. A three-month processing time is completely legal. Don’t compare yourself with others; problematic applications take longer. I’m not saying yours is problematic, but you shouldn’t book any flights yet. You won’t get any results today.”
I left with no progress and sent another email that day to the student visa mailbox (in Chinese, English, and Italian), as well as to my school requesting intervention. No reply was received. I had no choice but to reschedule my flight to September 23.

Desperate to attend school on time, I purchased an expedited visa service through an agency on September 16. From September 17 to 23, the agency sent multiple inquiries to various consulate mailboxes and the VFS visa center, receiving only deflective replies directing us to “contact the student visa mailbox” or “please do not urge visa processing.” Still, no substantial response came from the consulate.

On September 22, having still received no updates, I visited the consulate again with another classmate who was also waiting for their visa. The receptionist’s attitude was even worse this time; she gave us an email address and told us, “This inbox is checked by Italian colleagues. I don’t know anything. You’ll just have to wait.” When I explained that our term started on the 25th and we had already paid rent and bought tickets, she retorted, “That’s your problem. No one told you to buy tickets.”
We left again without resolution. The email she provided yielded the same deflection — “please contact the student visa mailbox.” Still, no one replied. I had to postpone my flight once more, to October 3.

After contacting my school’s admissions officer on September 23, I stopped the agency service and began communicating directly through the school. The officer said the dean would contact the consulate to resolve the issue. I received news on September 30 that my application had been processed and sent to the visa center. Because of the national holiday and the fact that I applied outside the consular city, I didn’t receive the documents until October 2—only to discover that my application had been rejected, despite receiving a visa issued confirmation on the pre-enrollment platform earlier that day.

Both the school and I were shocked. My admissions officer confirmed that such a situation had never happened in the school’s history—a “visa issued” status in the platform but an actual rejection from the consulate. The officer described this as a serious administrative error by the consulate, yet advised me not to raise this issue publicly to avoid jeopardizing my reapplication. Soon after, the school informed me that because the pre-enrollment system still showed my visa as “issued,” they could not modify my course or reinitiate the process.
I emailed the consulate again in Italian to explain, but once again, there was no reply. The school confirmed that the consulate had not responded to them either.

At this point, I had already suffered over 3,000 euros in direct economic losses. My original ticket (around 750 euros, later rebooked twice to 1000) became completely non-refundable, my prepaid three-month rent (around €2,000 total) was lost, and I missed a long-awaited concert I had bought tickets for nearly a year prior.

The situation escalated on October 8, when I went to the consulate again after days of silence from all sides. I prepared relevant regulations and documentation in advance, but was still met with mockery, ignorance, and discrimination.
The security guard claimed he had “never heard of pre-enrollment” and insisted it was a “third-party website unrelated to the consulate.” I got shocked at his claim and then tried to explain what pre-enrollment is, yet the security guard firmly believed that this ""pre-enrollment"" was an unknown third-party platform, and swore to me, ""You mean that the visa results of our consulate were published on this third-party platform? Our consulate will never publish the results of our visas on any third-party platform."" Then he asked me to send an email to this platform, the consulate had nothing to do with this, and thought I was the unreasonable one that he turned his head and said proudly to the receptionist, ""Look, I have explained it to her,"" and the receptionist shrugged her shoulders to acquiesce. 

I then tried to communicate with the receptionist, who kept repeating, ""We cannot bypass our chain of command to contact them. Please send an email if you have any issues."" I explained that my previous emails had received no response whatsoever, but it was still to no avail. Later on, I found that the receptionist could interrupt me three times with ""send an email"" before I could finish a single sentence, completely ignoring what I was saying. After wasting time trying to reason with them to no effect, I demanded to speak with their superior. The security guard shook his head and declared, ""No one will be coming out to see you today"" with a condescending attitude. I made it clear that I wouldn't be leaving until my issue was resolved. I also insisted on sitting on the sofa by the entrance, as I needed to contact my school. To my surprise, I wasn't even granted permission to sit. The security guard told me, ""If you need to contact the school, sure you can do so. Get out, find a coffee shop, and contact them at your leisure. There are plenty just across the road downstairs.""

The turning point came when an elderly Italian couple arrived to conduct business. The receptionist and security guard promptly left me standing aside and turned their attention to welcoming them actively. The receptionist went into the office to fetch an Italian staff member to attend to them, while I continued arguing with the security guard. The elderly couple and the Italian staff member stood watching us. I then requested that i would like to speak with the Italian staff member. The security guard retorted, ""Certainly. This gentleman is a police officer from our consulate. You may discuss anything with him,"" before scrutinising me from head to toe and delivering the most irritating sentence of my entire visit in a scornful tone:
 “Do you even speak English?”—a deeply insulting question given that I just graduated from high school and scored 7.0 on the IELTS without tutoring. I replied indignantly and astonished, ""Of course I speak English,"" and promptly explained my situation to the Italian staff member. Upon hearing this, he immediately informed me he would go inside to find someone to assist me, asking me to take a seat in the meantime. Only then was I granted permission to sit down within the consulate. At this point, the security guard and receptionist's demeanour finally softened. The security guard again inquired about the pre-enrollment. Only after I retrieved the relevant pre-enrollment information from the consulate's official website, presented the visa approval email, and the guard verified that the email address matched the pre-registration platform URL did he finally relent.

Another Italian lady soon emerged from the back office and exchanged a brief, muted conversation with the receptionist behind the counter. The receptionist then informed me that my school itself had issued my visa on the pre-enrollment platform, not the consulate. This only heightened my frustration and left me deeply disappointed in the professionalism of the consulate staffs. I had to explain once more to the receptionist why this was fundamentally impossible and how the pre-enrollment platform actually functioned. After another round of discussion, the front desk told me the Italian lady would go back in to check whether my pre-enrollment was genuine. She returned and they had another private discussion. The receptionist then informed me they would email the pre-enrollment platform to change my status, but that I couldn't depart this year. While it was my right to submit my visa application, they would not issue me any further study permits. This was entirely based on her word alone, without providing any written terms or justification. The receptionist then pointed to the Italian lady and remarked, ""Our boss is truly kind-hearted, looking into this for you when they wouldn't normally bother,"" implying I should be profoundly grateful. But when they make such a significant error in their work, isn't rectifying it simply their duty?


Later that day, I received confirmation that my “issued” status on the pre-enrollment platform had been revoked. The school promptly modified my course information, and I prepared for a second application. But on October 9, only hours after downloading my new pre-enrollment receipt, I received another rejection email from the platform. The consulate appeared to have retroactively refused my new application, without realizing the system had already been updated.
To make matters worse, the consulate failed to return key documents such as my notarized papers and proof of funds, forcing me to pay for and reissue them within days.

My classmate, who shared my situation, also received a rejection on October 8. We both reapplied on October 13 at the Shanghai VFS center—he in the morning, I in the afternoon. Both of us planned to fly on October 24, the last direct flight to Milan from our city. His visa was approved within three days; mine remained stagnant.
The school informed us that several other students in the Shanghai jurisdiction faced the same issue. Despite three formal letters and multiple failed phone attempts, the consulate never replied. On October 22, my admissions officer personally flew from Milan to Shanghai and visited the consulate, only to find that my application had been buried under a pile of tourist visas—completely untouched. The consulate promised to process it immediately and respond to the school’s emails. They did neither.

Another week passed in total silence. On October 31, I discovered a missed call from a Shanghai landline suspected to be the consulate’s. I immediately emailed to explain and repeatedly called back nearly 30 times, from 2 p.m. until their 5 p.m. closing time. No one answered, and the email went unanswered as usual. That evening, I received a message from VFS instructing me to pick up my materials—confirming yet another rejection.

After such a long, exhausting, and humiliating ordeal, I must ask:	
•	Why did the Consulate General of Italy in Shanghai ignore multiple inquiries from both the applicant and the university?
•	Why did the staff display such discriminatory and unprofessional behavior toward students?
•	How could such a serious administrative error and lack of procedural consistency occur repeatedly within an official government institution?

I have suffered severe financial losses, mental distress, and academic disruption due to the consulate’s negligence and mishandling. Therefore, I will be submitting formal complaints to the Embassy of Italy in Beijing, the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MAECI), and initiating legal action through the Italian Administrative Court to determine whether the consulate’s actions were lawful and proper.

1oo7j1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1oo7j1t/need_thoughts_and_help_breakup_after_20_months/,Need Thoughts and help // BREAKUP After 20 months,"Hello together,

i want to share my story as I feel totally empty right now. I am from Germany, so please apologize my English..  ME(M28) + HER W27

I go into every Detail as soon as it possible

Started January 24. Met her on Tinder..

It was a time in my life where I was a bit sad about my life situation especially about my love life, I mean I am good looking guy but I its really hard those days to find a women where you have something serious with and I was never into friends with benefits or something like that.  I know it all starts in your head and if you change the way you look at things, things will change but.. easier said as done

And I really wanted a relationship. That was how I am feeling..

Problem number 1 was the whole time; she lived 120 km away from me and had now driver license.. we only had the weekend to spend time together and often she worked Saturdays a view hour so we didn’t had every Saturday for us but talking about the first 8-12 monthsEvery time she had work off, she went immediately to the train and drive to me, because she lived with her parents and we said it is the best to met in my home. Talked a lot of this and all was clear. At least I tought, but I am a man.. probably at the end of the real. It wasn’t..

 We went officially together after 2 months.. a bit early I know.. so from 1.03.24 – 26.10-25 + 2 months dating and all that. So almost 2 x years all together.

After 4-5 months together, I already start talking with friends and my mom about the relationship if it is really the right thing.. I am a Person who love to improve grow and everything like that. I do A LOT of sport it means the world to me, because in my toughest times sport helped me out 8 years ago, And as long as I am able to do sport I will always find time for it.  I run between 50-90km every week + do a lot of weight training as well, I go early to sleep eat most of the time clean and take care of myself. I try to. My dream is to live 1x day from my sport, my dream is what keeps me alive right now

She was smoking, the only think in her life was drinking coffee and hanging with her gay best friend and her another friend. No Purpose in Life. She was a really negative person everything we did there was some argument, because she find always a point to be sad. If we play golf she was not good and she went mad, destroyed the whol activity and I could give you a thousand more examples. After 5-6 Month I have seen her real face, and I was one step to break up with her. But I always had a feeling she is there for me, she is from Greece and pretty, but not that much. But I liked that she always was there for me if had bad days and was sorrow she tried to help me to be there.. maybe those were only empty words, but I will never know

Sept. 2024 8 months together.. first holidays together.. a view days in Amsterdam. Nice moments, and I keep it as a good vacation right now in the back of my mind, but there we had a lot of arguments as well

One night she Totally going crash out because we couldn’t find a god spot to eat, and MRS Princess don’t want to eat “ Food where she can eat in Germany as well “

But at the last day we went the whole night to a bar, drink some bear and where very close to each other. Was 1x of the best situations with her. Sex in the hotel was good at that night.. but tbh the whole sex life was never good. Maybe i was bad as well, but I dont know. She did nothing and was passive, and she was not good. But I accepted it the whole relationship. I said there are more important things in life than sex.

OCT 24 she decided to quit her Job “she is not happy anymore” she worked in a Donut store.. but hey I HATE JOB SHARING so it was never a problem for me.

THOUGH TIME. She always had much money problems the whole relationship. I payed the most of the time, and I don’t have that much money as well..

Than she missed to register on the Working place in Germany, where you need to register if you lost your job and have nothing, that you will receive at least a bit of money. I told her 20 x times please do this, this is important.  BUT LIKE ALWAYS not her own fault.

She had 4 Months almost no money.. no job.. she was depressive. AND in this time I wanted to break up with her I had have enough, but I couldn’t handle it.. I felt so sorry for her.. I already said if her live is a bit better I will do it, but I was already not anymore happy..

3 jobs where she quit already after 1- 2months  and than April 25 she received a new job in a big clothing store where she was happy.  At this time ive seen she changed her whole character, she gained more self-assurance and everything like that. Excuses why we cant meet start getting more and more and the last 2x months before our break up I was pretty sure she lied very often to me. Every weekend there as another dump reason why she cant hang out with me on the weekend etc.

Didn’t seen us the whole OCT.  and I don’t wanted to drive to her as well.. because she never invited me to hear parents’ house as well.  SO yeah, it sounds soo strange after being this long together, but we didn’t knew each other parents in Person..

 We had one time a situation. I remember Somewhere like November 2014, ater being 10 months together. We have Sunday afternoon an argument and I brought her to the train that she can drive home.

Before the train arrived she cried and told me directly “ I love you “ but in this siuation was not happy with the relationship and how things went I could not tell herr back.. that was a though situation in my life..

2 months before the official break up we had an argument where she seemed very very cold to me and after I talked and tried to figure out about she is feeling about me, and our relationship I heard out that she is already thinking about breaking up.. but I could clear all things that evening, but I Relazied how cold she went.. I always talked to her please talk to me if we should change something if you are not happy,but she never did tbh. This was the first time and only because I was talking to her and we had this argument. She told me ecavtly about the situation where she told me one time I LOVE YOU and I never said it back to her.. I already forgot about this.. no evil thoughts. why I did not tell her later.. and she said our whole Realtionship is so loveless and she was thinking we are only together because of habit. I told her that iam a cold person and it is really really hard for me and how much I Like here.. it was all okay than, at least I Tought.  BUT NOW I realized I have to putt all my love to the realationship To save it maybe, but I already had in the back of mind IF A WOMEN START already thinking about break up, she will do it sooner or later, so I let things keep going.. 2-3 months going and Lying starts going on  one time SHE HAD NO MONEY; than her Sister visit her the whole weekend, than she was sick, than she forgot that he had to work on Monday early and Saturday. SO I REALZIED TOTALLY THIS THING IS OVER. AND I THOUGHT THIS WILL BE THE RIGH THING TO LET THINGS TAKE THEIR WAY.. 

26 OCT she said to me we need to talk and I knew that was the final. I drove 120 km and she went in my arms and cried 15 mins.. and than we break up.. send her flower 3 days later and tried everything but she blocked.. Game Over.. 1 x Day before she called me ""darling""

2 days after breakup she unfollowed me everywhere, did delete all what was with me together on social media und ON THE SAME DAY we break officially up she downloaded Tinder. That hit me like a knife deep in my heart. I tought I don’t want her, and I f think logic we did not fit together but WHY I Miss her so much ??? I cant really, if I close my eyes and want to sleep I FEEL SCARED; PAIN AND the feeling that I Failt as a men. This pain kills me ☹ DID THIS RELATIONSHIP END BECAUSE I TOLD HER NEVER ENOUGH LOVE ? ☹

I have strong feeling of Guilty. I cant handle this. 

I saw after the break up an album on her pinterest where there some situations she liked, and I never did to here because she did not told me.. Probably about Iloveyou and sexual things..

I all hurts very much I be honest..

 Can you give me your thoughts on this ? ☹ can you help me..

 I already would have the oppourtinity to date a view other girls, but I cant imagine right now.. and I KNOW SHE Already start dating and met new guys ☹ I ve seen a view new guys on her instagram already..  I have the feeling she don’t even remember us and what we had..

this is so tough for me :( 

 Maybe all was a big LIE, but I already checked here, and I swear to you all I never had that feeling for 1 sec that she cheated on me in the whole relationship. I checked her insta all 2-3 days no boys, no new like, private..  maybe she did and I did not realize it, but anyway…

Now its over I thinking I lost everything.

 Sorry for all mistakes did write this all on work and probably forgot important details.. but yes maybe I will update tonight",2,1762263964.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Like many here, I have a compulsion to keep quality older laptops going and going and going. I bought my X270 about six years ago, second-hand. Since then, it’s traveled to around thirty countries, spent half a year in a war zone, several months in a country in revolution, and now lives on an island in the Caribbean.

It has never, not once, stopped me from working (or playing).

My original power brick died a couple of years ago. I bought a cheap replacement, and that died too. But, I can charge it with my USB-C phone charger. The internal battery failed, but of course it kept running on the removable one. I replaced the internal battery, and the next week the external died. I picked up a 68+, and now, eight years after it rolled off the assembly line, I still get nearly a full day of battery life for general use.

The CPU fan gave out this year. I replaced it, and all was well again. The internal WiFi antenna plug broke, so I just plugged in a USB WiFi dongle. I’ve dropped it. I’ve spilled coffee on it. I super-glued the rubber foot back on. I replaced a couple of captive screws in the case. It just keeps going.

32GB RAM, i7-7600U, a 2TB 2.5-inch SSD, and a 512GB NVMe in the WWAN slot. After all this time, it’s still 100% functional - honestly, it feels “like new.”

I’ve flirted with buying a *""*new"" laptop.

But every time I do, I open the lid of the X270, see that faint shine worn into the keyboard from years of typing, and realize I don’t want a new one. This machine has been through more than most people’s travel bags, and it still greets me daily with a reminder of what strong, flexible, maintainable, engineering used to mean. In 2025, it's simply irreplaceable. 

It now lives on a boat, and this old ThinkPad feels like an anchor. It’s crossed borders, weathered storms, and outlived fads. The click of the keys, the way the hinges still feel firm, the quiet confidence of a tool built to last. 

There’s something comforting about it. 

Maybe that’s why we keep these things alive. Because somewhere between the scuffed palm rest and the faded lid, we see proof that durability still exists.

Here’s to the ThinkPads that refuse to die, and to the people who keep them alive.

1oo7hhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChillSG/comments/1oo7hhh/connect_level_up_relaxed_space_real_interaction/,"Connect & Level Up – Relaxed Space, Real Interaction, Connect Over What You Love","**Hey everyone,**

We were the first to kick off this group forming movement back in September. It’s truly inspiring and incredible to see so many step up to start new groups. Launching a group is no small feat, and sustaining momentum while bringing people together for genuine, meaningful connections is even more remarkable.

What started as a small idea—bringing together people who felt lonely to celebrate birthdays online and wish each other —quickly grew into something much bigger. Naturally, with growth, some unwanted vibes crept in. 

Over time, we’ve tightened the rules, keeping the group chill, relaxed, and a genuinely positive space. Now, we’re considering opening the doors to a few more members—people who bring energy, passion, and meaningful conversations.

**Who we’re looking for:**

If you enjoy:

* Fitness, macro discussions, or are on a weight-loss journey
* Deep discussions on philosophy, psychology, or self-growth
* Networking or sharing insights about banking, finance, law, or tech
* Music—whether you’re a DJ, producer, performer, or just an enthusiast
* Skills - whether you’re into baking, coding, electrical work, plumbing, share your passions and real-world skills with us—we value action and expertise over mindless typing.

…then you’ll fit right in.

**What matters to us:**

1. **Active participation**. Genuine interest in connecting, sharing experiences, and discussing passions—no pointless yapping, clique teasing or toxic brain rot. We dont expect daily yapping, but make an effort to connect, say hi/hello to one another etc. Dont just lurk. 
2. **Openness to watching live online events**, like watching F1, World Cup matches, or other sports together.
3. **Willingness to host or plan simple events**: coffee catch-ups, tea parties, casual hangouts.
4. **Enjoyment of fun, simple online multiplayers and simple card games** like Uno or Exploding Kittens 
5. **A positive, growth-oriented mindset.** No endless complaining or negativity—we have Reddit for that right?

This group is a platform for you to connect with others and invite the friends you meet here for meetups. While the group occasionally organizes events, the real magic happens when you take the initiative to host your own gatherings. Don’t worry—we’ll be here to guide and support you every step of the way.

If this resonates with you, we’d love for you to join us!

**Age requirement:** 25 and above.

**Please DM instead of commenting if you are interested to join. I don’t always receive notifications.**

Feel free to ask any questions, and I’ll do my best to provide helpful answers.",1,1762263857.0,ChillSG,0,1.0,False
1oo7he2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mononucleosis/comments/1oo7he2/how_long_did_it_take_for_derealizationbrain_fog/,How long did it take for derealization/brain fog to go away? What did you do?,"I'm on month four since symptoms started. Tbh I have never really struggled with fatigue with mono except the first three weeks. But after two months I started getting brain fog and derealization. Sometimes it feels like everything is fuzzy or dream like, sometimes it feels like I got punched hard in the head by Rhonda Rousey and have a concussion lol. Other times it feels like I'm high or like I was high and am in that transition period between when you are high and sober. And this week it is hitting me really hard, especially because I got a cold last week. I think the brain fog, pressure in forehead and the derealization are the symptoms I hate the most about this whole thing.

I also know some of my symptoms are my fault. I have ADHD and struggle with impulse control. So occasionally I will have coffee (and sometimes too much), and I have maybe had four beers in total over the last two months because in the moment I acted impulsively. Never got drunk. But I also get that drinking alcohol when your body is recovering is dumb. I also will sometimes do too much exercise (dopamine seeking). The problem is that I have these periods of feeling basically normal for a few days at a time, and during those periods I will forget how shitty a relapse feels and then maybe drink too much coffee, walk too much, or have a beer with a friend. I also should mention that my liver values have never been abnormal this entire time and neither my spleen nor my liver have been enlarged. Also the mono infection was really shitty timing because it hit right when I was starting a new job and three months before a big trip to Asia. I rested as much as I could, but still.

People who recovered, when did the brain fog and derealization go away? Was there anything in particular you did? People with ADHD, how did you not give into dopamine chasing activities which make symptoms worse? ",1,1762263850.0,Mononucleosis,0,1.0,False

I met a guy on Grindr, and our conversation flowed really well. We had a ton in common video games, hobbies, shows, memes, even being bilingual in the same language but in a different country. At first, I didn’t take it too seriously, but as the conversation went on I realized we were really similar.

I make it a rule to clarify upfront whether someone is single, in an open relationship, or cheating before anything physical happens. I asked him explicitly on the app and he said no.

We met for coffee on Tuesday, the banter was great, I asked him explicitly once more time in person and he said no so we took it further we kissed in the elevator. We saw each other a lot over the next few days, walks, dinners, shopping for Halloween, even late-night phone calls. Because we live in the same building, it was easy to coordinate. I started feeling like it was going too fast, so I told him I needed a break to breathe.

On Sunday, during a walk, he dropped the bomb: he actually has a partner of two years. My jaw dropped. Everything made sense, why he couldn't host because of his ""flatmate and “rules,” the things that felt inconsistent. He admitted he initially just wanted a hookup, but things got complicated as he “liked me more.”

I felt completely taken advantage of. I had trusted him with my boundaries, my history with anxiety, and my need for informed consent. I realized he lied repeatedly and withheld critical information until it escalated. After that, I blocked him.

I keep replaying everything in my head because we could have been great friends, and I’m new to the city with very few connections. I feel a mix of anger, betrayal, and sadness.

1oo7flw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oo7flw,Why is the larger Nescafé Sunrise pack more expensive per gram than the small sachet?,"Hey everyone,

I noticed something strange while comparing two Nescafé Sunrise Instant Coffee–Chicory Mixture packs. Both have the exact same ingredients (Coffee 60%, Chicory 40%) and are made in the same Nestlé factory (Mysore, Karnataka).

Here’s what I found 👇

Small pack:

Net weight: 6.7 g

Price: ₹10

Cost per gram: ₹10 ÷ 6.7 = ₹1.49 per gram


Large pack:

Net weight: 45 g

Price: ₹160

Cost per gram: ₹160 ÷ 45 = ₹3.56 per gram


That means the bigger pack costs more than double per gram compared to the small sachet, which is the opposite of how bulk pricing usually works. Both clearly mention the same formulation and even share the same FSSAI license number.

I initially thought maybe the bean grade or blend quality might differ, but since both come from the same plant and use the same 60:40 mix, that seems unlikely. So I’m wondering:

Is this just a weird pricing strategy by Nestlé?

Or are consumers genuinely being overcharged for the larger pack?

Anyone working in FMCG or retail know why this happens?


Would love to hear what others think and if anyone has noticed similar pricing oddities in other brands too.

His story isn't over yet; some people really think that's all it takes—sitting on the throne and that's it. I could agree if we didn't have any proof or someone from management saying ""he's dead,  dead for good!""
—  I'm truly disappointed, especially those who claim to be his fans and participate here and blinded by assumptions even when we have THE CANVA pinned' to this sub. And still there are those who claims as if he never contributed a damn thing. And those who use arguments still get downvote for presenting something relevant. I expected at least if there were a minority to be smarter than the rest of the Genshin community, which, as far as we know, has a degree of ""I don't read la-la-la"" ✨✨ 
That's when I truly realize we're alone in limbo. It's just us and us. . 🤡

For a long time I've noticed patterns, not only in Capitano's unfinished story, but also in characters who are constantly sidelined—characters who have existed since 1.x, and we don't know NOTHING, And that is indeed the company's fault. 
And I hope that those chars who remain don't receive the same treatment as Capitano.
They will try to drag out the story as much as possible and pad it out as much as possible to make money and remain relevant for years. But ""ITS OKAY"" to blame the characters victims of the lousy decisions of the Genshin team responsible for delivering dogshit. Let's talk about some that were also released and didn't contribute anything as characters and it was just a gacha slop and bandaid, and the fandom doesn't even remember 'they exist'?  Let's also talk about a character who had the potential to be playable in the future, but was released early and now it's only relevant within its own story? I'm grateful that at least this *could be just a Scaramouche case. It's a lengthy story, but at least it will be delivered well by a competent team. Durin is also a case very similar to Capitano, a dragon who had previously was presumed dead for good. and whose heart remained in the Dragon Spine delivering material for a spear (does this remind you of anything?); 

Since the goldens days of Genshin; simply no one knew that they cared ENOUGH ...to bring a character back to life and turn him human. Durin's story was built during the Simulanka event, an event that once again the bum of Genshin team's turned something so important into something limited, and now this idiot here has to explain why ""This happened because of this and that""

She is/was just like me in the morning: lethargic until I had water, food, a bm, and enough time in the sunlight. Unfortunately adhdwomen tend to experience irregular sleep/circadian cycles, and it’s already so obvious with her. Night owl (no matter how early or intense or not we prep for bedtime) and a motivation-depleted slug in the morning, no matter if I strap her to me so she can physically feel my heart beat or do morning chores with me to get movement. No matter what, any failure or struggle is a hit to my mood and nervous system. 

This morning I tried to put on Danny Go, he’s like a fun toddler dance guy on YT, really fast paced but catchy enough to make her want to copy him. Could this disguised workout video be her new morning coffee? (Promise I never gave her caffeine lol) but for real. 

Yes, It’s a screen, but she mirrored him over mirroring my husband or me. And she woke up fast and in a great mood. Not sorry. 

For anyone in my position who needs to try it, oas soon as she was done with one video she was up and about. We turned it off and talked and colored until she was ready to go. Fingers crossed I’ve found something that works. I suck at responding but anyone with morning hacks for adhd kids SLING EM THIS WAY!! Peace and love to you all.

1oo79ef,https://tipstor.com/harvest-tours-in-maui-hawaii-usa/,"Harvest Tours in Maui, Hawaii, USA","There’s a kind of magic in the soil of upcountry Maui. It’s red, rich, and alive with the hum of something ancient. Here, the land gives back to those who respect it, and the farmers know it well. They rise with the mist and the roosters, tending to rows of papayas, avocados, and taro that seem to grow with more attitude than anywhere else in the Pacific. The experience isn’t just about eating. It’s about earning the right to eat. Visitors are handed baskets and told to pick their own ingredients. Sun-warmed tomatoes, fragrant herbs, and just-pulled carrots become the raw materials for the meal of a lifetime.

When the picking’s done, the farm’s chefs take over. Their open-air kitchen fills with the scent of seared vegetables, fresh fish caught that morning off the coast, and coffee roasted from nearby groves that cling to the hillsides. The food is plated simply. Because Maui doesn’t need embellishment. A salad still warm from the field, ahi with a crust of macadamia and sea salt, and desserts sweetened with local honey. Every bite tastes of place. Earth, sun, and salt air.

Adventure here doesn’t stop at the table. Those with restless energy can trade forks for fins and dive into the island’s wilder offerings. Surfing along the North Shore is less a sport and more a spiritual test. Wave after wave pounding like nature’s applause. The Haleakalā volcano offers another kind of thrill. Watching the sunrise from 10,000 feet above the clouds, where the world feels stripped to its raw elements.

The best time to come is from April to October, when the island’s rhythm feels perfectly balanced between calm and chaos. The waves are kind, the skies are clear, and the produce sings with color. Nights end with glasses of locally distilled rum or a dark, velvety cup of Maui coffee. Strong enough to keep anyone awake for the next sunrise.

Upcountry Maui isn’t just a meal, a view, or a vacation. It’s a reckoning with what food is supposed to be. Real, unhurried, and unapologetically alive.

1oo78w1,https://i.redd.it/sictrw7ft8zf1.jpeg,Why is the larger Nescafé Sunrise pack more expensive per gram than the small sachet?,"Hey everyone,

I noticed something strange while comparing two Nescafé Sunrise Instant Coffee–Chicory Mixture packs. Both have the exact same ingredients (Coffee 60%, Chicory 40%) and are made in the same Nestlé factory (Mysore, Karnataka).

Here’s what I found 👇

Small pack:

Net weight: 6.7 g

Price: ₹10

Cost per gram: ₹10 ÷ 6.7 = ₹1.49 per gram


Large pack:

Net weight: 45 g

Price: ₹160

Cost per gram: ₹160 ÷ 45 = ₹3.56 per gram


That means the bigger pack costs more than double per gram compared to the small sachet, which is the opposite of how bulk pricing usually works. Both clearly mention the same formulation and even share the same FSSAI license number.

I initially thought maybe the bean grade or blend quality might differ, but since both come from the same plant and use the same 60:40 mix, that seems unlikely. So I’m wondering:

Is this just a weird pricing strategy by Nestlé?

Or are consumers genuinely being overcharged for the larger pack?

Anyone working in FMCG or retail know why this happens?


Would love to hear what others think and if anyone has noticed similar pricing oddities in other brands too.

That friend (the girl I’m talking about) said she thought I was cute.

When I got home, I decided to add her on Instagram. My friend told me that she’d probably post a story soon — specifically so I could reply to it and start a conversation. And that’s exactly what happened. She posted a story that same day, and honestly, the only reason she uploaded it was for me to reply to it. If I hadn’t added her, or if my friend hadn’t mentioned it, she probably wouldn’t have posted that story at all.

So, I replied to the story, and the conversation went really well. We were both laughing, asking each other questions, and it felt natural and back-and-forth. She didn’t seem uninterested at all.

A couple of days later, she sent me a snap out of nowhere. I replied, and again, it was a nice short conversation. That was about six days ago though, and since then, nothing.

All I’ve done since then is save one of her snaps (just a normal selfie) and like one of her Instagram stories. She hasn’t interacted with me at all since — she doesn’t reply to my close friends’ stories, she doesn’t like anything, she doesn’t save any snaps, and she’s never texted me first.

Now, I don’t mind texting first, but I just don’t know what to say anymore without it feeling random or forced. If she was totally uninterested, I feel like our earlier conversations wouldn’t have been that fun — they were genuinely good and easy.

Also, keep in mind we live in Egypt, so asking a girl out or hanging out early on isn’t really common or culturally normal here. It’s not like in the West where you can casually grab coffee to get to know someone.

So yeah, I’m just wondering — do I text her first again, even if it’s something corny or random? Or is she just not interested and I should take the hint?",1,1762263232.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False
1oo78b5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1oo78b5/is_there_such_a_thing_as_caffeine_sensitivity_or/,Is there such a thing as caffeine sensitivity or does this sound like anxiety?,"I have not had caffeinated coffee in 7 years but I continue to enjoy Coke and tea just fine without any ill effects. I had no issue with coffee until suddenly I noticed heart racing and a harder time talking myself down from anxious feelings…. For instance I read caffeine leaves your system after 4 hours, and I’d still be incredibly anxious 8+ hours later. However I was also just going through a time in my life where my mental health wasn’t the best. 

Now I am a mom of 3, with newborn twins, and I’m ready for the real thing again. I’m wondering if I can simply…. Have a cup of coffee? Like I said I’ve never stopped with the Coke and sweet tea, but I know those are also relatively low in caffeine as drinks go. 

I’m just worried I may be overlooking a real issue with how my body processes caffeine. Is that something that really happens, and if so, do I sound like I meet the criteria for looking into it further?

*Where the odds are stacked, the injuries are piling up, and the history books are stuck on repeat.*

---

**Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game**  
Birmingham City enters this Tuesday night clash as the clear favorite, with odds hovering around **1.8 (implied probability: \~55%)**, while Millwall sits at **4.3 (23%)** and the draw at **3.4 (29%)**. These numbers scream “back the home team,” but let’s not let the math do all the talking.

Birmingham’s recent 4-0 dismantling of Portsmouth has them smelling playoff proximity, while Millwall’s four-game winning streak was snuffed out by a last-minute equalizer against Oxford—a result that’s left their fans muttering about “so close, yet so… drawn.” Historically, Birmingham has only one win in 11 league meetings against Millwall since 2023, but their St. Andrew’s fortress is a different beast: they’ve won **seven midweek home games in a row** in League One, conceding just once. Meanwhile, Millwall’s “unbeaten” away streak against Birmingham (eight games) includes **five draws**—a record that’s less “dominance” and more “can’t finish a game without a coffee break.”

---

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Confidence, and a Manager’s Midlife Crisis**  
Birmingham’s confidence is justified. Fresh off that 4-0 thrashing, they’re likely to play “defense-first, celebrate-later” ball, relying on their home crowd’s roar (and maybe a few well-timed slide tackles). But Millwall? They’re limping into this one. Key attackers **Femi Azeez** and **Ryan Leonard** are out with knocks sustained in that Oxford draw, leaving manager Alex Neil to reshuffle his “Lions” without their paws. Wes Harding steps into defense, and Aidomo Emakhu gets a shot at midfield—think of it as swapping a lion’s mane for a squirrel’s tail.

Millwall’s Alex Neil,

It also touches on threats and harassment.

>On Connecticut town Facebook pages, commenters call local leaders corrupt, take aim at them with expletives and assign uncharitable nicknames.

>“Many municipal officials feel like they’re under attack in the community,” said Elizabeth Gara, executive director of the Connecticut Council of Small Towns. “And it’s not just an issue in local politics, it’s an issue across the nation.”

>More than half of local elected officials have experienced threats or harassment, according to a [study](https://bridgingdivides.princeton.edu/experience-hostility-increases-worry-among-local-officials-negatively-impacting-willingness-engage?utm) of over 4,000 of these officials conducted by Princeton University’s Bridging Divides Initiative (BDI) and CivicPulse.



>Other [BDI research](https://bridgingdivides.princeton.edu/updates/2025/issue-brief-interviews-local-elected-officials-spotlight-acute-safety-concerns-wake) found that local politicians have been particularly on edge in the wake of highly publicized incidents of political violence — among them the assassinations of Hortman and activist Charlie Kirk and the arson of the home of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.

>In the first half of 2025, there was a 9% increase in harassment of local officials compared with the same period last year, according to the study, which identified nearly 300 incidents of harassment in the first half of this year.

>Nancy DiNardo, former chair of the Connecticut Democratic party from 2005 to 2015, said that during her tenure, residents were generally civil toward people running for office because they often knew them personally or through local communities.

For some people who might consider running for office, “that is definitely a deterrent,” Russo said.

1oo6z5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1oo6z5t/i_saw_the_first_superhero_end_the_world/,I Saw the First Superhero End the World,"I was sitting at my desk, thumbing through the case files of a low-level gang-slash-domestic terror group, trying to line up the evidence and witness testimony just right for a judge to approve a search warrant. The whole thing was a headache—half lies, half hearsay. I don’t spend a lot of time in the office, but when I do, I always notice the same things. The fluorescent lights hum like they’re trying to hypnotize you. That stale, overcooked coffee smell never really leaves the air. Phones ring. People talk—sometimes about leads, sometimes about weekend plans. It all kind of blurs together after a while. I was trying to make it all make sense when there was a knock at my office door.

“Come in,” I yelled, distracted, still scanning the paperwork.

I heard the door open, footsteps—two sets—and the quiet scrape of polished shoes on tile. My supervisor, sure. But the other guy? New face. He had the full federal uniform: high-and-tight haircut, no stubble in sight, fitted black suit, earpiece, and the kind of sunglasses that belonged in a spy movie, not a field office.

I’d barely registered the noise. Honestly, a grizzly bear could’ve walked in, and I probably wouldn’t have noticed. But when the stranger stepped in, something in the room shifted. Enough to make me finally look up.

“Lance, this is Special Agent Moores from the DOD. He’s come here personally to talk to you about a new case,” my supervisor said, and I could hear the tension in his voice.

The man *always* looked stressed—like the last time he slept was sometime during the Cold War. He wore his exhaustion like a uniform: bags under the eyes, crumpled shirt, coffee-stained teeth. Still, he cracked a half-smile and nodded nervously.

The Department of Defense doesn’t just *drop in* on the FBI. Not without a reason.

“Well. I’ll let you two talk it out,” he said, and ducked out of the office like he couldn’t get away fast enough.

I hadn’t really looked up until then—too wrapped up in the casework—but I finally glanced over. Moores stood there grinning like he’d just found a new toy.

“So, the rumors about you are true,” he said. “I can see why you were recommended.”

Recommended? That sounded like a headache I didn’t need.

“Special Agent… Morris?” I asked without much interest.

“Moores,” he corrected, frowning slightly.

“Look,” I said, going back to my files, “I’ve got four other cases I’m juggling, and across those, I’m managing six informants, cross-checking statements, building timelines—and I’m sure you understand how critical it is that everything adds up. So I appreciate you making the trip, but if you’re here to toss another case on my desk, I’ve got to pass.”

His smile came back like it never left.

“Special Agent Lance Taylor,” he began, like he was reading from a resume. “Started out as a DHS coordinator, managed a laundry list of high-priority events. Transferred to FBI Counterintel, where—according to your file—you’re responsible for taking down a half-dozen people who would’ve slipped right through the cracks. Calm under pressure. Solid with assets. You’re exactly who we need.”

I finally looked up at him. That smile was still there, like it was painted on. I leaned back in my shitty office chair and rubbed my eyes.

“I’m guessing you didn’t fly all the way out here to give me a compliment. Thanks, by the way. But let me tell you—”

Moores cut me off.

“First, you don’t really have a choice. Second, all your current cases are being reassigned. And third—once you find out who your new asset is, you’ll be the envy of the entire department.”

The way he said it—too slick, too casual—made it sound like we were about to go on some wild bender together. I hated him already. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t intrigued.

“Asset?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.

He told me he’d explain everything once we were airborne, en route to Nevada.

Before we left, he asked if I had a go-bag ready.

Of course I did. In this line of work, you never knew when you’d get called away for a few days—or a few weeks.

We left from Andrews Air Force Base on a private jet. I sat across from Moores, arms folded, waiting for him to get to the point. It wasn’t easy letting go of the cases I’d been building for years. They’d become a part of me. But from the sound of it, I didn’t have a say in the matter.

He opened a briefcase and slid a file across the table.

“Tell me, Lance—do you believe in superheroes?”

I blinked. Thought I misheard him.

“Superheroes?” I chuckled, half annoyed. “Is this some kind of joke?”

Moores shook his head.

“I had the same reaction. But take a look.”

He tapped the file.

“Vaughn Garrison. Former Coast Guard. Master’s degree in astrophysics. Worked with NASA’s Deep Space Observatory program. On Tuesday, August 10th, 2021, an unidentified object crashed just outside the observatory. No radar signature. It was like it appeared out of nowhere.”

I opened the file. Dozens of pages, images, satellite photos, testimony.

“Vaughn was the first to investigate. Being the man of science that he is, he approached the crash site. As he got close, the object pulsed with light—then exploded. His team initially thought it was radioactive. They assumed the explosion was a reaction to something in our atmosphere.”

Moores paused, staring out the jet window before continuing.

“Emergency response was called. When they arrived, Vaughn was alive… but barely. From his navel to the top of his head, he had what looked like fourth-degree burns. Still, he was conscious. The med team ran scans—zero radiation. On the way to the hospital, they noticed something even stranger: his skin was regenerating. By the time he arrived, it looked like he had a really bad sunburn, and even that was fading fast.”

He turned back to me, his face lit up like a kid with a new toy.

“He woke up three hours later. The sudden burst of movement as he sat up nearly destroyed the hospital bed—and the ceiling above it. Then, without warning, he panicked… and began to fly.”

I stared at him, still flipping through the pages. It felt like an elaborate prank, some classified training op for an experimental prototype. But Moores wasn’t joking. He believed every word.

“After that, Washington went into full lockdown. Committees, closed-door meetings, absolute chaos. Eventually, we created ORBIT—Office for Response to Biological, Interstellar, and Technological Threats. It’s not public yet. We’re building the infrastructure as we go.”

He leaned in slightly.

“We need someone to manage him. To monitor his mental state, emotional stability, health, intent. He’s cooperative now—but let’s be honest. This guy could decide to wipe us all out tomorrow. We need someone who knows how to handle people like him. Someone he can trust.”

He smiled again.

“Between your work at FEMA and the Bureau, you were unanimously chosen.”

Still trying to process what I’d just heard, I thumbed through Vaughn’s file in silence.

Born in Galveston, Texas. Parents: Troy and Rita Garrison. A solid B-average student. Joined the Coast Guard at 18. Earned commendations for his response during Hurricane Ike. Attended the University of Texas, then got his master’s from Caltech. Later recruited to NASA’s Deep Space program.

A model citizen.

The file was filled with service photos—Coast Guard operations, graduation ceremonies, trips to the Grand Canyon, amusement parks, childhood birthdays. Just… normal stuff. The kind of stuff that makes it harder to believe he could become a walking nuclear event.

We landed at Nellis Air Force Base, where I was led to a massive white tent—one of those temporary government field labs, the kind with more secrecy than walls. Armed military police patrolled the perimeter in tight loops.

“No one gets within fifty feet of the walls without clearance,” Moores said with a grin. “MPs have orders to shoot on sight if anyone does.”

Inside, the tent was part science lab, part command center. Equipment I didn’t recognize. Monitors, scanners, data feeds. A constant low hum of activity.

And in the center of it all… was him.

Vaughn Garrison. He looked nervous. Confused. Like a man who’d stumbled into the wrong room and wasn’t sure how to leave without making it worse.

His medium-brown hair was messy, like he’d been running a hand through it for hours. He had a stocky, compact build—denser than his photos suggested, like he was built to take hits. The kid in the file looked average. The man standing in front of me didn’t. Not anymore. He was being scanned by a scientist with some handheld device while another scribbled notes so furiously it was like the pen might catch fire.

Moores waved the scientists away. “Vaughn, meet your liaison—Special Agent Lance Taylor. He’s here to give a face to this new... situation we’re all adjusting to.”

Vaughn turned to me with a faint, uncertain smile. You could tell he’d been through hell. There was something in his eyes—strain, maybe, or confusion just barely hidden under the surface. Whatever it was, it didn’t match the calm, smiling kid I’d just seen in those photos. This was someone trying hard to hold it together.

“Hello, Special Agent Taylor,” he said, almost timid.

I extended my hand, but he shook his head. “I’m sorry. I’m not used to my strength yet. I don’t want to hurt you.” First time someone ever apologized for not shaking my hand—and meant it.

“Understandable, son,” I said, letting my hand drop.

Moores excused himself to get an update, leaving the two of us standing there under the glare of bright halogen lights. As soon as he was gone, Vaughn relaxed a little, like he could finally breathe again.

“So, how are you feeling, Mr. Garrison?” I asked.

For a second, I saw a flicker of relief cross his face—like no one had thought to ask him that since the whole nightmare started.

““You’re the first person who’s asked me that.Everyone else just wants readings or reports.Honestly?” he said, his voice shaking. “I’m nervous. They keep calling me the world’s first superhero. They say I can do good, but right now I feel like a lab rat. They’re trying to come up with some kind of training regimen, I think.”

He hesitated, then added, “They say it’s about helping people, making the world safer… but I think it’s also about showing off. Improving America's image. Maybe even flaunting their new weapon.”

I glanced around the tent. No one was paying us attention. I lowered my voice.

“Do you want to be a superhero?”

That caught him off guard. He looked at me like no one had ever asked him that either. Maybe they hadn’t.

He thought for a while before answering.

“Yes and no,” he said finally. “I mean… I’m living every kid’s dream. I was given these abilities. I should use them for something good, right? When I was in the Coast Guard, there were things I couldn’t stop—people I couldn’t save. Now I can. But… I get it. The government’s scared. Hell, I’m scared. I just want to make a difference, that’s all.”

His expression softened, his fear replaced by a small spark of hope. And even though I’d known him for maybe five minutes, that flicker of optimism rubbed off on me.

A few months passed. ORBIT had developed a full training program to help Vaughn harness his powers—flight stabilization, light projection, energy control. They called him Vanguard. Blue suit, red and gold trim, half-mask for plausible deniability. Someone upstairs thought the ‘V’ and ‘G’ logo combo made him look like a patriotic baseball team. But the kid wore it well…and the public ate it up. What got me was the branding. Red “V,” blue “G” outlined in gold—same as his initials. Vaughn Garrison.

That might’ve been a coincidence. Or it might’ve been cooked up before he even agreed to it. I didn’t ask. Didn’t want to know.



Soon after, they introduced him to the world.

The rollout was cautious at first, His first big save? A collapsed bridge in Denver. Forty-seven people pulled out of the wreckage. Footage of him lifting a school bus one-handed hit twelve million views in two hours. And just like that, Vanguard was a household name. Public reaction was mixed. Some people were inspired. Others were terrified. The religious crowd said he was an omen. The conspiracy types swore he was a weapon. But after he started saving people—disasters, hostage situations, floods—the tide turned. The world fell in love with Vanguard.

ORBIT expanded fast—too fast. What started as a small, closed-door task force turned into a multinational agency with authority across borders. Officially, they operated under global cooperation treaties. Unofficially? Some nations were getting nervous. Everyone was watching Vanguard like he was a loaded gun pointed at the planet.

A year later, a freak flood hit Tennessee.The air smelled like rot and diesel. Vaughn looked like a walking corpse by the end of it, soaked, drained, still moving. I’d never seen him tired before. That scared me more than anything. Vaughn worked around the clock for a week straight, barely stopping to eat. He redirected rivers, pulled families from rooftops, cleared debris with energy constructs. I might’ve slept eight hours the whole week, tops. Vaughn saved hundreds.

When the immediate danger passed, ORBIT told us to stand down. Vaughn could’ve flown back to D.C. in an hour, but I convinced him to ride back with the team. Washington wanted regular mental health assessments—no surprise there. They were terrified he’d snap.

Normally, he was upbeat, always cracking jokes or asking about my cases back at the Bureau. But that time, he seemed distant. Tired.

“You doing alright, V?” I asked.

He didn’t answer at first—just stared out the window like he wasn’t really there.

“Come on, man. You can tell me.”

“I’m fine,” he said eventually. “Just… weird dreams, that’s all.”

“Dreams?” I pressed.

He rubbed the back of his neck, frowning. “Yeah, but that’s the thing—I don’t remember them. I just wake up in a cold sweat. Sometimes I feel like I’ve been running, or fighting. But I never remember what it was.”

That caught my attention. Whatever could shake a man like Vanguard must’ve been one hell of a dream.

He looked over at me and smiled weakly. “You know, Lance, thanks for being my friend. I know you’re my handler, but you actually… care. I appreciate that.”

It caught me off guard.

“It’s no problem, kid. You’re doing good work. You’ve saved a lot of lives.”

He nodded and went quiet again.

At the time, I told myself it was nothing. Just exhaustion. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t worried.

Months went by. Vaughn became a natural at the job. He moved with confidence now—saving lives, preventing disasters, representing something people hadn’t felt in a long time: hope.

One morning, I was buried under a pile of emails—thank-you notes, media requests, the usual PR circus—when my office phone rang. It was Ron, one of the senior monitoring advisers.

“Hey, Lance… uh, I need you to come down here. Now,” he said. His voice was low and tense, like a man trying to disarm a bomb with shaking hands.

That tone got my attention. I made my way to his office.

Ron’s workspace looked like NASA control had a baby with the Weather Channel—rows of monitors showing international news, seismic graphs, radar data, security feeds, live cams. He looked pale, jittery.

“What’s going on?” I asked.

“Vanguard’s been doing… strange things,” he said. He gestured at his screens.

I stepped closer. Each monitor showed footage from around the world—Tokyo, Moscow, Rome, Berlin, Rio. Vaughn was in every one of them, standing completely still. Same posture. Same blank expression. Just… staring.

“He’s been appearing in random locations across the globe,” Ron said, voice trembling. “All this happened within about four hours.”

I felt the hairs rise on the back of my neck.

“You’re saying he’s teleporting?”

“I don’t know what to call it,” Ron said. “We can’t track him. He’s there one second, gone the next. And in every clip, he looks—” He stopped himself. “It’s not good optics, Lance. The higher-ups are calling it ‘international vigilance,’ but… the countries he’s been popping up in? They’re not buying it.”

Yeah. A superhuman god-figure silently appearing in your streets doesn’t exactly scream friendly.

I called Vaughn immediately and asked him to come in.

When he arrived, I showed him the footage. His reaction was genuine shock.

“What? I don’t remember any of this,” he said, eyes wide. “When was this?”

Ron ran him through the timestamps, the locations. Vaughn just kept shaking his head.

“I don’t know… maybe I was sleepwalking? I swear, I don’t remember.” His expression shifted from confusion to horror, like he was realizing something inside him might not belong to him anymore.

“I know you’re not gonna like this,” I said carefully, “but they’re probably going to want to put a tracker on you. Just until we figure this out.”

He nodded slowly, still pale. “Yeah. Okay.”

He stood there for another second, like he wanted to say something more—but didn’t. Then he turned and walked out of the room without another word.

I turned to leave when Ron stopped me.

“There’s one more thing,” he said quietly. He entered a password and opened a hidden folder on his system. “I didn’t show this to the higher-ups. Figured it’d only cause a panic. But you need to see it.”

The video feed came up—a small-town post office in South Dakota. Vaughn stood beside a mailbox, motionless at first. Then he started laughing. Not a normal laugh—this was deeper, rawer. The kind of laugh you hear right before someone breaks completely.

There was no audio, but just watching it chilled me to my core. Something about it felt wrong. Ancient, even.

Ron’s fingers trembled on the mouse. He didn’t blink while the footage played. His lips were pressed into a tight line like he was holding something in—or holding something back.

Ron shut the video off. The silence that followed felt heavy.

“Unsettling” didn’t even begin to describe it. Something in my gut twisted, and I knew, deep down, that this wasn’t over.



There were no more incidents for a while.

I told the brass Vaughn had been under pressure, probably sleepwalking due to stress. They didn’t buy it entirely, but they didn’t want to push too hard, either. Washington was still walking the razor’s edge—trying to manage him without provoking him.

They agreed: he’d wear a tracker, but only while he slept. A compromise, they said. Temporary.

Weeks passed.

The dreams started soon after.

At first, they were the kind you don’t remember. I’d wake up in a cold sweat with the distinct sensation that something had happened. My heart would be pounding, my skin cold, my mouth dry.

Then the dreams started to take shape.

In them, I was alone in a white void—no sound, no temperature, just a colorless space that stretched on forever. I walked slowly, head down, watching my feet move like I wasn’t really in control of them. Then, I’d feel something—like gravity shifting.

I’d stop.

And I’d look up.

There it stood.

A thing. Massive. The only way I can describe it is some kind of deer—if a deer were the size of a skyscraper and carved from dark matter. Its body was an inky, ocean-deep blue, like the sea under a starless sky. Its antlers branched like the limbs of trees or the tendrils of galaxies—mountains of bone reaching in every direction, each one wrapped in swirling nebulae.

Its eyes…

Its eyes pierced through me.

Two where they should be. And a third—dead center in its forehead. Triangular in placement. Immense. Endless.

All three stared at me.

And in that gaze, I felt stripped of everything. Not just clothes or skin, but identity. I was a flea beneath a god. I was nothing.

Then I’d wake up. Heart racing. Gasping.

The dreams came every few days.

At first, I tried to dismiss them—stress, trauma, whatever. But deep down, I knew. People don’t dream the same dream over and over unless something’s wrong.

In one dream, I looked closer at one of the flowers blooming on the deer’s back. Inside its open petals… I swear I saw Vaughn’s face. Not the man he was—but the boy. Smiling. Waiting. Like he’d been part of this all along.

Weeks passed. Vaughn seemed normal—more confident, more polished. He was becoming the face of global protection.

Until NASA called.

It was a quiet Thursday morning. An object had entered Earth’s atmosphere—fast, humanoid-shaped, and not of this world.

I grabbed Vaughn, and we deployed via ORBIT helicopter. Just before boarding, that deer flashed in my mind again. No reason. Just… popped in. I shook it off.

The impact site wasn’t far. Vaughn got there first. I radioed in for an update.

“Uh… so,” his voice crackled through the comms, “you guys remember Close Encounters? Well… imagine that alien on steroids.”

We arrived minutes later.

The thing standing in the middle of a destroyed cornfield looked like a textbook alien—gray skin, huge black eyes—but it had four arms, each one the size of a human torso, and it stood almost ten feet tall. Muscle packed onto muscle. Like it had been built for one thing only: violence.

It charged Vaughn immediately.

No monologue. No first contact. No explanation.

Just war.

The alien moved like a blur—arms whipping in a whirlwind of punches like some nightmare version of a gatling gun. Vaughn tanked it. Took every hit on the chin and answered with a cross that would’ve decapitated a lesser being.

The alien staggered but came back with a haymaker that sent Vaughn into the earth—literally embedded him into the dirt.

We were all holding our breath.

Then something happened.

Something wrong.

Vaughn’s body started to glow—not the usual golden light we’d come to expect, but a pale, icy blue. His energy shifted. And so did his posture.

He stood up, slow. Too slow. Like something else was piloting him.

And then—he snapped.

Aggressive. Unrelenting. Furious.

He attacked with a brutality I’d never seen. Not just from him. From anyone.

He tore into the alien. Ripped off all four of its arms. Slammed it into the ground. Then fired a focused beam of light—blue, not gold—directly through its chest. A clean hole, maybe a foot wide.

The fight was over in under a minute.

We were stunned. Not because he won—but because of how he did it. There was no restraint. No control. Just annihilation.

We recovered the body. Vaughn sat near the helicopter, sipping bottled water, silent.

“That was pretty incredible,” I said, trying to keep my voice level. “I didn’t know you had—”

I froze.

His face.

That thousand-yard stare. Eyes wide, mouth slack, barely blinking. The dread hit me in the stomach like a cold hammer.

“That… that wasn’t me,” he said.

He looked up at me, pleading.

“Lance, I blacked out. One second I’m fighting—then I come to, and it’s over. I don’t remember any of it. I don’t like that I don’t remember.”

His voice cracked.

“What’s happening to me?”

I didn’t know. Not really. But something about him… something in his voice, or in his eyes, felt wrong. Like a storm gathering behind clear skies.



And I couldn’t shake it.



We ran every test we could think of. Physically, he was fine. Stable vitals. Normal scans. But there was something new—a faint frequency variation coming from him. Background noise, the scientists said. Nothing to worry about.

I worried anyway.

Vanguard was put on sabbatical.

We told him to rest, see his parents, try to reconnect with normal life. He agreed. His parents were proud. Supportive. They had no idea what was really going on. Hell, I wasn’t sure I knew what was going on.

Meanwhile, the dreams got worse.

Now, instead of just seeing the deer, I was floating beside it. Flying in that empty void, watching the beast move beneath me like a living mountain of starlight and smoke.

Its fur shimmered like mist, coiling and shifting like fog over a dark moor. But hidden in that mist—if you looked closely enough—were flowers. Small, delicate blooms, barely visible, scattered across its body like stars in a constellation.

Each flower opened slowly.

Inside each one… a face.

Some looked like the alien Vaughn had killed. Others were stranger—reptilian, insectoid, one like a twisted anteater.

And all of them were laughing.

Not just laughing—singing, in a way that became laughter. Or maybe it was the other way around.

And then… I started to laugh with them.



I wasn’t sleeping much anymore.

Caffeine pills, energy drinks, whiskey—whatever it took to stay awake. I’d tried quitting a few times. Couldn’t take the stress. But every time I got close, the higher-ups reminded me that Vaughn only trusted me. Switching handlers could destabilize him, they said. Could trigger something.

That’s the last thing anybody wanted.



Something new hit Earth’s radar at 9:12 a.m.

Not from space this time. The trajectory didn’t match any known meteor pattern; it just appeared in the middle of a small New Jersey town.

Reports came in describing a thirteen-foot wolf-shaped creature, armor-plated hide, a single golden eye burning in its skull. It didn’t talk. It didn’t roar. It simply stood—and then started tearing through everything in reach.

ORBIT scrambled every resource we had. Vanguard led the charge.

He came in fast, a streak of blue and gold against a gray morning sky, and hit the thing like a missile. For twenty minutes they fought—punches like thunderclaps, shock waves rippling through the air. Vaughn finally won, driving the monster into the ground hard enough to crack pavement three streets over.

The world cheered again.

From my monitor in D.C., I watched it unfold in real time. For a moment, pride bloomed in my chest. Then he turned toward one of the cameras.

And I saw it.

Just for a heartbeat.

A third eye, glowing faintly on his forehead—exactly like the deer from my dreams.

When I blinked, it was gone. I replayed the footage again and again, frame by frame. Nothing. But I knew what I’d seen.

That night, back in my apartment, I poured a glass of whiskey, swallowed a couple of sleeping pills, and tried to convince myself I was hallucinating. My coffee table was littered with Vaughn’s files. I flipped through them out of habit—birth records, Coast Guard commendations, family photos.

One picture stopped me cold.

Vaughn at maybe fourteen, posing at a wildlife museum, a stuffed deer in the background. His shirt said Space Camp, his grin wide and goofy. But just above his brow, in the grain of the photo, was a faint mark—like a third eye burned into the film.

I slammed the file shut.

I turned on the TV for distraction, anything but that goddamn deer. The local news was covering a new “laughter epidemic.” People were breaking into hysterics in public—doctors baffled, psychologists overwhelmed. I killed the power and went to bed, praying the drugs and alcohol would finally drown the dreams.

They didn’t.

The laughter followed me there.



More creatures began to fall from the sky.

One in South Carolina—a tank-sized hybrid of mammoth and gorilla. Then Paris. Moscow. Beijing. Tokyo. Dallas. Salt Lake City. Green Bay. Cuba. Each one worse than the last.

Every two or three weeks another impact. Each battle left another city in ruins.

And each time, only Vanguard stood between us and extinction.

He fought relentlessly, but the fights were getting longer. The shine in his eyes dimmed. Between missions he’d sit in silence, hands trembling, as if something inside him was eating away at his humanity.

Public opinion shifted from worship to fear. People didn’t question if he’d lose—they wondered what would happen when he did.

We examined the remains of every creature he killed. Radiation-proof. Bio-proof. Resistant to heat, cold, acid, vacuum. Nothing on Earth could have hurt them—except him.

Meanwhile, I was falling apart.

Sleep was a rumor. My veins buzzed with caffeine and morphine. I told myself I needed them just to function, but truth was, I couldn’t face closing my eyes. The dreams had become too vivid.

One night, after a cleanup operation in Los Angeles, I saw it sprayed across a half-collapsed wall:

A blue deer with three eyes.

Underneath, in dripping paint: You will all sing for me.

I wanted to tear my own brain out.



Then came the big one.

The sky split open above Branson, Missouri. A shape fell through—part squid, part demon, all nightmare. Its tentacles blotted out the sun. Power grids failed for a hundred miles.

Vanguard went in first, but this time the monster swatted him out of the air like a fly. He hit the ground at the speed of a meteor, got back up, tried again. Over and over. Each time slower. We could feel the hopelessness radiating across the world.

Then something changed.

The cameras caught it first—a glow, bright enough to turn night into day. Vaughn rose from the crater, body blazing with the same cold blue light as before, but stronger. His form sharpened until he looked carved from living energy.

And then I saw them.

Antlers.

Rising from his skull like radiant branches. A third eye burning in the center of his forehead.

I fell to my knees. Around me, people began to snicker. At first, soft. Then louder. Then uncontrollable.

Vaughn—no, whatever he’d become—raised one shining hand. A blinding flash filled the city. When it cleared, the demon was gone. Not destroyed—erased.

No cheering this time. Just silence. Awe. Dread.

He drifted upward and flew away.



They found him later, standing on the roof of ORBIT headquarters, motionless, overlooking D.C.

Tests said he was alive—heartbeat, brain activity, everything normal—but he didn’t move. Didn’t eat. Didn’t speak.

For three weeks he stood there, a statue of light.

During that time, I maybe slept five hours total. My body was collapsing. The morphine barely took the edge off. The dreams had become constant—no longer visions but realities I visited every time I blinked.

The deer filled them all. The flowers on its body bloomed and sang. I laughed until I cried, until I thought my skull would split.

Finally, I broke.

I went to confront him.

I looked like hell—stained shirt, shaking hands, pupils the size of quarters—but I didn’t care. I knew how to move through ORBIT’s security without being noticed. I’d been there from the start.

When I reached the roof, he was still standing there, glowing against the night sky.

“What do you want?” I shouted. My voice cracked. “Answer me, you big blue deer bastard! Answer me!”

My knees buckled. I sobbed into my palms.

Then—movement.

He turned.

My stomach clenched like someone had dropped a live wire inside me. He looked down with that same blank expression, then smiled—a huge, unnatural grin—and shot into the sky.

The alarms went off seconds later.

He was heading for D.C. proper.

I followed the task force in a convoy, sirens screaming. By the time we arrived… the White House was gone. So were half the monuments.

Crowds had gathered—senators, staffers, civilians—all staring upward with the same empty expression.

I shoved through them until I could see.

Vanguard floated above the crater, rearranging debris—bricks, steel, dirt—into a massive throne on the White House lawn. When it was finished, he sat down.

Then the laughter started again.

First a few chuckles. Then hundreds. Then thousands.

Until the whole world was laughing.

I don’t know how long it’s been.

Years, maybe. Decades. Centuries.

Time stopped meaning anything the moment the world began to laugh.

When every voice on Earth joined that sound—pure, unhinged laughter rising like a tidal wave—it was as if reality itself cracked open.

And we… changed.

I watched it happen.

People around me started to convulse. Not in pain—more like they were giving in to something. Legs split and stretched, feet driving into the soil like roots. Arms unfolded into long green leaves. Faces bloomed into petals—soft, vivid, impossibly beautiful.

Every human being became a flower.

Not metaphorically. Not symbolically. Literally.

I don’t know why I stayed as I am. Maybe something in me held on. Maybe the drugs in my system disrupted the process. Maybe I was cursed to remember.

Or maybe… he left me behind on purpose.

I’ve watched them ever since. The flowers. They don’t move. Don’t wilt. They just exist—frozen in praise.

And he watches them.

Vanguard.

Still seated on his throne of twisted stone and memory. Glowing faintly blue. Antlers curled toward the stars. The third eye in his forehead never closes.

At some point, he stood and descended from the throne.

He walked straight to me.

I should’ve screamed. Run. Prayed. But I couldn’t move. Couldn’t blink.

He looked down at what was left of me. Not with malice. Not with joy.

With… sorrow.

A single word escaped him.

“I’m sorry.”

And then he turned and returned to his throne, surrounded by a garden of blooming souls singing their endless laughter‑song to a god who never asked to be worshipped.

I used to think my job was to protect people. Keep the chaos out. But I see it now—

I was just a witness. The last one left to remember the world before.

The last one still asking questions no one wants answered.

Maybe that’s what I was chosen for.

Not to stop the end.

Just to see it happen

1oo6xzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1oo6xzn/i_saw_the_first_superhero_end_the_world/,I Saw the First Superhero End the World,"I was sitting at my desk, thumbing through the case files of a low-level gang-slash-domestic terror group, trying to line up the evidence and witness testimony just right for a judge to approve a search warrant. The whole thing was a headache—half lies, half hearsay. I don’t spend a lot of time in the office, but when I do, I always notice the same things. The fluorescent lights hum like they’re trying to hypnotize you. That stale, overcooked coffee smell never really leaves the air. Phones ring. People talk—sometimes about leads, sometimes about weekend plans. It all kind of blurs together after a while. I was trying to make it all make sense when there was a knock at my office door.

“Come in,” I yelled, distracted, still scanning the paperwork.

I heard the door open, footsteps—two sets—and the quiet scrape of polished shoes on tile. My supervisor, sure. But the other guy? New face. He had the full federal uniform: high-and-tight haircut, no stubble in sight, fitted black suit, earpiece, and the kind of sunglasses that belonged in a spy movie, not a field office.

I’d barely registered the noise. Honestly, a grizzly bear could’ve walked in, and I probably wouldn’t have noticed. But when the stranger stepped in, something in the room shifted. Enough to make me finally look up.

“Lance, this is Special Agent Moores from the DOD. He’s come here personally to talk to you about a new case,” my supervisor said, and I could hear the tension in his voice.

The man *always* looked stressed—like the last time he slept was sometime during the Cold War. He wore his exhaustion like a uniform: bags under the eyes, crumpled shirt, coffee-stained teeth. Still, he cracked a half-smile and nodded nervously.

The Department of Defense doesn’t just *drop in* on the FBI. Not without a reason.

“Well. I’ll let you two talk it out,” he said, and ducked out of the office like he couldn’t get away fast enough.

I hadn’t really looked up until then—too wrapped up in the casework—but I finally glanced over. Moores stood there grinning like he’d just found a new toy.

“So, the rumors about you are true,” he said. “I can see why you were recommended.”

Recommended? That sounded like a headache I didn’t need.

“Special Agent… Morris?” I asked without much interest.

“Moores,” he corrected, frowning slightly.

“Look,” I said, going back to my files, “I’ve got four other cases I’m juggling, and across those, I’m managing six informants, cross-checking statements, building timelines—and I’m sure you understand how critical it is that everything adds up. So I appreciate you making the trip, but if you’re here to toss another case on my desk, I’ve got to pass.”

His smile came back like it never left.

“Special Agent Lance Taylor,” he began, like he was reading from a resume. “Started out as a DHS coordinator, managed a laundry list of high-priority events. Transferred to FBI Counterintel, where—according to your file—you’re responsible for taking down a half-dozen people who would’ve slipped right through the cracks. Calm under pressure. Solid with assets. You’re exactly who we need.”

I finally looked up at him. That smile was still there, like it was painted on. I leaned back in my shitty office chair and rubbed my eyes.

“I’m guessing you didn’t fly all the way out here to give me a compliment. Thanks, by the way. But let me tell you—”

Moores cut me off.

“First, you don’t really have a choice. Second, all your current cases are being reassigned. And third—once you find out who your new asset is, you’ll be the envy of the entire department.”

The way he said it—too slick, too casual—made it sound like we were about to go on some wild bender together. I hated him already. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t intrigued.

“Asset?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.

He told me he’d explain everything once we were airborne, en route to Nevada.

Before we left, he asked if I had a go-bag ready.

Of course I did. In this line of work, you never knew when you’d get called away for a few days—or a few weeks.

We left from Andrews Air Force Base on a private jet. I sat across from Moores, arms folded, waiting for him to get to the point. It wasn’t easy letting go of the cases I’d been building for years. They’d become a part of me. But from the sound of it, I didn’t have a say in the matter.

He opened a briefcase and slid a file across the table.

“Tell me, Lance—do you believe in superheroes?”

I blinked. Thought I misheard him.

“Superheroes?” I chuckled, half annoyed. “Is this some kind of joke?”

Moores shook his head.

“I had the same reaction. But take a look.”

He tapped the file.

“Vaughn Garrison. Former Coast Guard. Master’s degree in astrophysics. Worked with NASA’s Deep Space Observatory program. On Tuesday, August 10th, 2021, an unidentified object crashed just outside the observatory. No radar signature. It was like it appeared out of nowhere.”

I opened the file. Dozens of pages, images, satellite photos, testimony.

“Vaughn was the first to investigate. Being the man of science that he is, he approached the crash site. As he got close, the object pulsed with light—then exploded. His team initially thought it was radioactive. They assumed the explosion was a reaction to something in our atmosphere.”

Moores paused, staring out the jet window before continuing.

“Emergency response was called. When they arrived, Vaughn was alive… but barely. From his navel to the top of his head, he had what looked like fourth-degree burns. Still, he was conscious. The med team ran scans—zero radiation. On the way to the hospital, they noticed something even stranger: his skin was regenerating. By the time he arrived, it looked like he had a really bad sunburn, and even that was fading fast.”

He turned back to me, his face lit up like a kid with a new toy.

“He woke up three hours later. The sudden burst of movement as he sat up nearly destroyed the hospital bed—and the ceiling above it. Then, without warning, he panicked… and began to fly.”

I stared at him, still flipping through the pages. It felt like an elaborate prank, some classified training op for an experimental prototype. But Moores wasn’t joking. He believed every word.

“After that, Washington went into full lockdown. Committees, closed-door meetings, absolute chaos. Eventually, we created ORBIT—Office for Response to Biological, Interstellar, and Technological Threats. It’s not public yet. We’re building the infrastructure as we go.”

He leaned in slightly.

“We need someone to manage him. To monitor his mental state, emotional stability, health, intent. He’s cooperative now—but let’s be honest. This guy could decide to wipe us all out tomorrow. We need someone who knows how to handle people like him. Someone he can trust.”

He smiled again.

“Between your work at FEMA and the Bureau, you were unanimously chosen.”

Still trying to process what I’d just heard, I thumbed through Vaughn’s file in silence.

Born in Galveston, Texas. Parents: Troy and Rita Garrison. A solid B-average student. Joined the Coast Guard at 18. Earned commendations for his response during Hurricane Ike. Attended the University of Texas, then got his master’s from Caltech. Later recruited to NASA’s Deep Space program.

A model citizen.

The file was filled with service photos—Coast Guard operations, graduation ceremonies, trips to the Grand Canyon, amusement parks, childhood birthdays. Just… normal stuff. The kind of stuff that makes it harder to believe he could become a walking nuclear event.

We landed at Nellis Air Force Base, where I was led to a massive white tent—one of those temporary government field labs, the kind with more secrecy than walls. Armed military police patrolled the perimeter in tight loops.

“No one gets within fifty feet of the walls without clearance,” Moores said with a grin. “MPs have orders to shoot on sight if anyone does.”

Inside, the tent was part science lab, part command center. Equipment I didn’t recognize. Monitors, scanners, data feeds. A constant low hum of activity.

And in the center of it all… was him.

Vaughn Garrison. He looked nervous. Confused. Like a man who’d stumbled into the wrong room and wasn’t sure how to leave without making it worse.

His medium-brown hair was messy, like he’d been running a hand through it for hours. He had a stocky, compact build—denser than his photos suggested, like he was built to take hits. The kid in the file looked average. The man standing in front of me didn’t. Not anymore. He was being scanned by a scientist with some handheld device while another scribbled notes so furiously it was like the pen might catch fire.

Moores waved the scientists away. “Vaughn, meet your liaison—Special Agent Lance Taylor. He’s here to give a face to this new... situation we’re all adjusting to.”

Vaughn turned to me with a faint, uncertain smile. You could tell he’d been through hell. There was something in his eyes—strain, maybe, or confusion just barely hidden under the surface. Whatever it was, it didn’t match the calm, smiling kid I’d just seen in those photos. This was someone trying hard to hold it together.

“Hello, Special Agent Taylor,” he said, almost timid.

I extended my hand, but he shook his head. “I’m sorry. I’m not used to my strength yet. I don’t want to hurt you.” First time someone ever apologized for not shaking my hand—and meant it.

“Understandable, son,” I said, letting my hand drop.

Moores excused himself to get an update, leaving the two of us standing there under the glare of bright halogen lights. As soon as he was gone, Vaughn relaxed a little, like he could finally breathe again.

“So, how are you feeling, Mr. Garrison?” I asked.

For a second, I saw a flicker of relief cross his face—like no one had thought to ask him that since the whole nightmare started.

““You’re the first person who’s asked me that.Everyone else just wants readings or reports.Honestly?” he said, his voice shaking. “I’m nervous. They keep calling me the world’s first superhero. They say I can do good, but right now I feel like a lab rat. They’re trying to come up with some kind of training regimen, I think.”

He hesitated, then added, “They say it’s about helping people, making the world safer… but I think it’s also about showing off. Improving America's image. Maybe even flaunting their new weapon.”

I glanced around the tent. No one was paying us attention. I lowered my voice.

“Do you want to be a superhero?”

That caught him off guard. He looked at me like no one had ever asked him that either. Maybe they hadn’t.

He thought for a while before answering.

“Yes and no,” he said finally. “I mean… I’m living every kid’s dream. I was given these abilities. I should use them for something good, right? When I was in the Coast Guard, there were things I couldn’t stop—people I couldn’t save. Now I can. But… I get it. The government’s scared. Hell, I’m scared. I just want to make a difference, that’s all.”

His expression softened, his fear replaced by a small spark of hope. And even though I’d known him for maybe five minutes, that flicker of optimism rubbed off on me.

A few months passed. ORBIT had developed a full training program to help Vaughn harness his powers—flight stabilization, light projection, energy control. They called him Vanguard. Blue suit, red and gold trim, half-mask for plausible deniability. Someone upstairs thought the ‘V’ and ‘G’ logo combo made him look like a patriotic baseball team. But the kid wore it well…and the public ate it up. What got me was the branding. Red “V,” blue “G” outlined in gold—same as his initials. Vaughn Garrison.

That might’ve been a coincidence. Or it might’ve been cooked up before he even agreed to it. I didn’t ask. Didn’t want to know.



Soon after, they introduced him to the world.

The rollout was cautious at first, His first big save? A collapsed bridge in Denver. Forty-seven people pulled out of the wreckage. Footage of him lifting a school bus one-handed hit twelve million views in two hours. And just like that, Vanguard was a household name. Public reaction was mixed. Some people were inspired. Others were terrified. The religious crowd said he was an omen. The conspiracy types swore he was a weapon. But after he started saving people—disasters, hostage situations, floods—the tide turned. The world fell in love with Vanguard.

ORBIT expanded fast—too fast. What started as a small, closed-door task force turned into a multinational agency with authority across borders. Officially, they operated under global cooperation treaties. Unofficially? Some nations were getting nervous. Everyone was watching Vanguard like he was a loaded gun pointed at the planet.

A year later, a freak flood hit Tennessee.The air smelled like rot and diesel. Vaughn looked like a walking corpse by the end of it, soaked, drained, still moving. I’d never seen him tired before. That scared me more than anything. Vaughn worked around the clock for a week straight, barely stopping to eat. He redirected rivers, pulled families from rooftops, cleared debris with energy constructs. I might’ve slept eight hours the whole week, tops. Vaughn saved hundreds.

When the immediate danger passed, ORBIT told us to stand down. Vaughn could’ve flown back to D.C. in an hour, but I convinced him to ride back with the team. Washington wanted regular mental health assessments—no surprise there. They were terrified he’d snap.

Normally, he was upbeat, always cracking jokes or asking about my cases back at the Bureau. But that time, he seemed distant. Tired.

“You doing alright, V?” I asked.

He didn’t answer at first—just stared out the window like he wasn’t really there.

“Come on, man. You can tell me.”

“I’m fine,” he said eventually. “Just… weird dreams, that’s all.”

“Dreams?” I pressed.

He rubbed the back of his neck, frowning. “Yeah, but that’s the thing—I don’t remember them. I just wake up in a cold sweat. Sometimes I feel like I’ve been running, or fighting. But I never remember what it was.”

That caught my attention. Whatever could shake a man like Vanguard must’ve been one hell of a dream.

He looked over at me and smiled weakly. “You know, Lance, thanks for being my friend. I know you’re my handler, but you actually… care. I appreciate that.”

It caught me off guard.

“It’s no problem, kid. You’re doing good work. You’ve saved a lot of lives.”

He nodded and went quiet again.

At the time, I told myself it was nothing. Just exhaustion. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t worried.

Months went by. Vaughn became a natural at the job. He moved with confidence now—saving lives, preventing disasters, representing something people hadn’t felt in a long time: hope.

One morning, I was buried under a pile of emails—thank-you notes, media requests, the usual PR circus—when my office phone rang. It was Ron, one of the senior monitoring advisers.

“Hey, Lance… uh, I need you to come down here. Now,” he said. His voice was low and tense, like a man trying to disarm a bomb with shaking hands.

That tone got my attention. I made my way to his office.

Ron’s workspace looked like NASA control had a baby with the Weather Channel—rows of monitors showing international news, seismic graphs, radar data, security feeds, live cams. He looked pale, jittery.

“What’s going on?” I asked.

“Vanguard’s been doing… strange things,” he said. He gestured at his screens.

I stepped closer. Each monitor showed footage from around the world—Tokyo, Moscow, Rome, Berlin, Rio. Vaughn was in every one of them, standing completely still. Same posture. Same blank expression. Just… staring.

“He’s been appearing in random locations across the globe,” Ron said, voice trembling. “All this happened within about four hours.”

I felt the hairs rise on the back of my neck.

“You’re saying he’s teleporting?”

“I don’t know what to call it,” Ron said. “We can’t track him. He’s there one second, gone the next. And in every clip, he looks—” He stopped himself. “It’s not good optics, Lance. The higher-ups are calling it ‘international vigilance,’ but… the countries he’s been popping up in? They’re not buying it.”

Yeah. A superhuman god-figure silently appearing in your streets doesn’t exactly scream friendly.

I called Vaughn immediately and asked him to come in.

When he arrived, I showed him the footage. His reaction was genuine shock.

“What? I don’t remember any of this,” he said, eyes wide. “When was this?”

Ron ran him through the timestamps, the locations. Vaughn just kept shaking his head.

“I don’t know… maybe I was sleepwalking? I swear, I don’t remember.” His expression shifted from confusion to horror, like he was realizing something inside him might not belong to him anymore.

“I know you’re not gonna like this,” I said carefully, “but they’re probably going to want to put a tracker on you. Just until we figure this out.”

He nodded slowly, still pale. “Yeah. Okay.”

He stood there for another second, like he wanted to say something more—but didn’t. Then he turned and walked out of the room without another word.

I turned to leave when Ron stopped me.

“There’s one more thing,” he said quietly. He entered a password and opened a hidden folder on his system. “I didn’t show this to the higher-ups. Figured it’d only cause a panic. But you need to see it.”

The video feed came up—a small-town post office in South Dakota. Vaughn stood beside a mailbox, motionless at first. Then he started laughing. Not a normal laugh—this was deeper, rawer. The kind of laugh you hear right before someone breaks completely.

There was no audio, but just watching it chilled me to my core. Something about it felt wrong. Ancient, even.

Ron’s fingers trembled on the mouse. He didn’t blink while the footage played. His lips were pressed into a tight line like he was holding something in—or holding something back.

Ron shut the video off. The silence that followed felt heavy.

“Unsettling” didn’t even begin to describe it. Something in my gut twisted, and I knew, deep down, that this wasn’t over.



There were no more incidents for a while.

I told the brass Vaughn had been under pressure, probably sleepwalking due to stress. They didn’t buy it entirely, but they didn’t want to push too hard, either. Washington was still walking the razor’s edge—trying to manage him without provoking him.

They agreed: he’d wear a tracker, but only while he slept. A compromise, they said. Temporary.

Weeks passed.

The dreams started soon after.

At first, they were the kind you don’t remember. I’d wake up in a cold sweat with the distinct sensation that something had happened. My heart would be pounding, my skin cold, my mouth dry.

Then the dreams started to take shape.

In them, I was alone in a white void—no sound, no temperature, just a colorless space that stretched on forever. I walked slowly, head down, watching my feet move like I wasn’t really in control of them. Then, I’d feel something—like gravity shifting.

I’d stop.

And I’d look up.

There it stood.

A thing. Massive. The only way I can describe it is some kind of deer—if a deer were the size of a skyscraper and carved from dark matter. Its body was an inky, ocean-deep blue, like the sea under a starless sky. Its antlers branched like the limbs of trees or the tendrils of galaxies—mountains of bone reaching in every direction, each one wrapped in swirling nebulae.

Its eyes…

Its eyes pierced through me.

Two where they should be. And a third—dead center in its forehead. Triangular in placement. Immense. Endless.

All three stared at me.

And in that gaze, I felt stripped of everything. Not just clothes or skin, but identity. I was a flea beneath a god. I was nothing.

Then I’d wake up. Heart racing. Gasping.

The dreams came every few days.

At first, I tried to dismiss them—stress, trauma, whatever. But deep down, I knew. People don’t dream the same dream over and over unless something’s wrong.

In one dream, I looked closer at one of the flowers blooming on the deer’s back. Inside its open petals… I swear I saw Vaughn’s face. Not the man he was—but the boy. Smiling. Waiting. Like he’d been part of this all along.

Weeks passed. Vaughn seemed normal—more confident, more polished. He was becoming the face of global protection.

Until NASA called.

It was a quiet Thursday morning. An object had entered Earth’s atmosphere—fast, humanoid-shaped, and not of this world.

I grabbed Vaughn, and we deployed via ORBIT helicopter. Just before boarding, that deer flashed in my mind again. No reason. Just… popped in. I shook it off.

The impact site wasn’t far. Vaughn got there first. I radioed in for an update.

“Uh… so,” his voice crackled through the comms, “you guys remember Close Encounters? Well… imagine that alien on steroids.”

We arrived minutes later.

The thing standing in the middle of a destroyed cornfield looked like a textbook alien—gray skin, huge black eyes—but it had four arms, each one the size of a human torso, and it stood almost ten feet tall. Muscle packed onto muscle. Like it had been built for one thing only: violence.

It charged Vaughn immediately.

No monologue. No first contact. No explanation.

Just war.

The alien moved like a blur—arms whipping in a whirlwind of punches like some nightmare version of a gatling gun. Vaughn tanked it. Took every hit on the chin and answered with a cross that would’ve decapitated a lesser being.

The alien staggered but came back with a haymaker that sent Vaughn into the earth—literally embedded him into the dirt.

We were all holding our breath.

Then something happened.

Something wrong.

Vaughn’s body started to glow—not the usual golden light we’d come to expect, but a pale, icy blue. His energy shifted. And so did his posture.

He stood up, slow. Too slow. Like something else was piloting him.

And then—he snapped.

Aggressive. Unrelenting. Furious.

He attacked with a brutality I’d never seen. Not just from him. From anyone.

He tore into the alien. Ripped off all four of its arms. Slammed it into the ground. Then fired a focused beam of light—blue, not gold—directly through its chest. A clean hole, maybe a foot wide.

The fight was over in under a minute.

We were stunned. Not because he won—but because of how he did it. There was no restraint. No control. Just annihilation.

We recovered the body. Vaughn sat near the helicopter, sipping bottled water, silent.

“That was pretty incredible,” I said, trying to keep my voice level. “I didn’t know you had—”

I froze.

His face.

That thousand-yard stare. Eyes wide, mouth slack, barely blinking. The dread hit me in the stomach like a cold hammer.

“That… that wasn’t me,” he said.

He looked up at me, pleading.

“Lance, I blacked out. One second I’m fighting—then I come to, and it’s over. I don’t remember any of it. I don’t like that I don’t remember.”

His voice cracked.

“What’s happening to me?”

I didn’t know. Not really. But something about him… something in his voice, or in his eyes, felt wrong. Like a storm gathering behind clear skies.



And I couldn’t shake it.



We ran every test we could think of. Physically, he was fine. Stable vitals. Normal scans. But there was something new—a faint frequency variation coming from him. Background noise, the scientists said. Nothing to worry about.

I worried anyway.

Vanguard was put on sabbatical.

We told him to rest, see his parents, try to reconnect with normal life. He agreed. His parents were proud. Supportive. They had no idea what was really going on. Hell, I wasn’t sure I knew what was going on.

Meanwhile, the dreams got worse.

Now, instead of just seeing the deer, I was floating beside it. Flying in that empty void, watching the beast move beneath me like a living mountain of starlight and smoke.

Its fur shimmered like mist, coiling and shifting like fog over a dark moor. But hidden in that mist—if you looked closely enough—were flowers. Small, delicate blooms, barely visible, scattered across its body like stars in a constellation.

Each flower opened slowly.

Inside each one… a face.

Some looked like the alien Vaughn had killed. Others were stranger—reptilian, insectoid, one like a twisted anteater.

And all of them were laughing.

Not just laughing—singing, in a way that became laughter. Or maybe it was the other way around.

And then… I started to laugh with them.



I wasn’t sleeping much anymore.

Caffeine pills, energy drinks, whiskey—whatever it took to stay awake. I’d tried quitting a few times. Couldn’t take the stress. But every time I got close, the higher-ups reminded me that Vaughn only trusted me. Switching handlers could destabilize him, they said. Could trigger something.

That’s the last thing anybody wanted.



Something new hit Earth’s radar at 9:12 a.m.

Not from space this time. The trajectory didn’t match any known meteor pattern; it just appeared in the middle of a small New Jersey town.

Reports came in describing a thirteen-foot wolf-shaped creature, armor-plated hide, a single golden eye burning in its skull. It didn’t talk. It didn’t roar. It simply stood—and then started tearing through everything in reach.

ORBIT scrambled every resource we had. Vanguard led the charge.

He came in fast, a streak of blue and gold against a gray morning sky, and hit the thing like a missile. For twenty minutes they fought—punches like thunderclaps, shock waves rippling through the air. Vaughn finally won, driving the monster into the ground hard enough to crack pavement three streets over.

The world cheered again.

From my monitor in D.C., I watched it unfold in real time. For a moment, pride bloomed in my chest. Then he turned toward one of the cameras.

And I saw it.

Just for a heartbeat.

A third eye, glowing faintly on his forehead—exactly like the deer from my dreams.

When I blinked, it was gone. I replayed the footage again and again, frame by frame. Nothing. But I knew what I’d seen.

That night, back in my apartment, I poured a glass of whiskey, swallowed a couple of sleeping pills, and tried to convince myself I was hallucinating. My coffee table was littered with Vaughn’s files. I flipped through them out of habit—birth records, Coast Guard commendations, family photos.

One picture stopped me cold.

Vaughn at maybe fourteen, posing at a wildlife museum, a stuffed deer in the background. His shirt said Space Camp, his grin wide and goofy. But just above his brow, in the grain of the photo, was a faint mark—like a third eye burned into the film.

I slammed the file shut.

I turned on the TV for distraction, anything but that goddamn deer. The local news was covering a new “laughter epidemic.” People were breaking into hysterics in public—doctors baffled, psychologists overwhelmed. I killed the power and went to bed, praying the drugs and alcohol would finally drown the dreams.

They didn’t.

The laughter followed me there.



More creatures began to fall from the sky.

One in South Carolina—a tank-sized hybrid of mammoth and gorilla. Then Paris. Moscow. Beijing. Tokyo. Dallas. Salt Lake City. Green Bay. Cuba. Each one worse than the last.

Every two or three weeks another impact. Each battle left another city in ruins.

And each time, only Vanguard stood between us and extinction.

He fought relentlessly, but the fights were getting longer. The shine in his eyes dimmed. Between missions he’d sit in silence, hands trembling, as if something inside him was eating away at his humanity.

Public opinion shifted from worship to fear. People didn’t question if he’d lose—they wondered what would happen when he did.

We examined the remains of every creature he killed. Radiation-proof. Bio-proof. Resistant to heat, cold, acid, vacuum. Nothing on Earth could have hurt them—except him.

Meanwhile, I was falling apart.

Sleep was a rumor. My veins buzzed with caffeine and morphine. I told myself I needed them just to function, but truth was, I couldn’t face closing my eyes. The dreams had become too vivid.

One night, after a cleanup operation in Los Angeles, I saw it sprayed across a half-collapsed wall:

A blue deer with three eyes.

Underneath, in dripping paint: You will all sing for me.

I wanted to tear my own brain out.



Then came the big one.

The sky split open above Branson, Missouri. A shape fell through—part squid, part demon, all nightmare. Its tentacles blotted out the sun. Power grids failed for a hundred miles.

Vanguard went in first, but this time the monster swatted him out of the air like a fly. He hit the ground at the speed of a meteor, got back up, tried again. Over and over. Each time slower. We could feel the hopelessness radiating across the world.

Then something changed.

The cameras caught it first—a glow, bright enough to turn night into day. Vaughn rose from the crater, body blazing with the same cold blue light as before, but stronger. His form sharpened until he looked carved from living energy.

And then I saw them.

Antlers.

Rising from his skull like radiant branches. A third eye burning in the center of his forehead.

I fell to my knees. Around me, people began to snicker. At first, soft. Then louder. Then uncontrollable.

Vaughn—no, whatever he’d become—raised one shining hand. A blinding flash filled the city. When it cleared, the demon was gone. Not destroyed—erased.

No cheering this time. Just silence. Awe. Dread.

He drifted upward and flew away.



They found him later, standing on the roof of ORBIT headquarters, motionless, overlooking D.C.

Tests said he was alive—heartbeat, brain activity, everything normal—but he didn’t move. Didn’t eat. Didn’t speak.

For three weeks he stood there, a statue of light.

During that time, I maybe slept five hours total. My body was collapsing. The morphine barely took the edge off. The dreams had become constant—no longer visions but realities I visited every time I blinked.

The deer filled them all. The flowers on its body bloomed and sang. I laughed until I cried, until I thought my skull would split.

Finally, I broke.

I went to confront him.

I looked like hell—stained shirt, shaking hands, pupils the size of quarters—but I didn’t care. I knew how to move through ORBIT’s security without being noticed. I’d been there from the start.

When I reached the roof, he was still standing there, glowing against the night sky.

“What do you want?” I shouted. My voice cracked. “Answer me, you big blue deer bastard! Answer me!”

My knees buckled. I sobbed into my palms.

Then—movement.

He turned.

My stomach clenched like someone had dropped a live wire inside me. He looked down with that same blank expression, then smiled—a huge, unnatural grin—and shot into the sky.

The alarms went off seconds later.

He was heading for D.C. proper.

I followed the task force in a convoy, sirens screaming. By the time we arrived… the White House was gone. So were half the monuments.

Crowds had gathered—senators, staffers, civilians—all staring upward with the same empty expression.

I shoved through them until I could see.

Vanguard floated above the crater, rearranging debris—bricks, steel, dirt—into a massive throne on the White House lawn. When it was finished, he sat down.

Then the laughter started again.

First a few chuckles. Then hundreds. Then thousands.

Until the whole world was laughing.

I don’t know how long it’s been.

Years, maybe. Decades. Centuries.

Time stopped meaning anything the moment the world began to laugh.

When every voice on Earth joined that sound—pure, unhinged laughter rising like a tidal wave—it was as if reality itself cracked open.

And we… changed.

I watched it happen.

People around me started to convulse. Not in pain—more like they were giving in to something. Legs split and stretched, feet driving into the soil like roots. Arms unfolded into long green leaves. Faces bloomed into petals—soft, vivid, impossibly beautiful.

Every human being became a flower.

Not metaphorically. Not symbolically. Literally.

I don’t know why I stayed as I am. Maybe something in me held on. Maybe the drugs in my system disrupted the process. Maybe I was cursed to remember.

Or maybe… he left me behind on purpose.

I’ve watched them ever since. The flowers. They don’t move. Don’t wilt. They just exist—frozen in praise.

And he watches them.

Vanguard.

Still seated on his throne of twisted stone and memory. Glowing faintly blue. Antlers curled toward the stars. The third eye in his forehead never closes.

At some point, he stood and descended from the throne.

He walked straight to me.

I should’ve screamed. Run. Prayed. But I couldn’t move. Couldn’t blink.

He looked down at what was left of me. Not with malice. Not with joy.

With… sorrow.

A single word escaped him.

“I’m sorry.”

And then he turned and returned to his throne, surrounded by a garden of blooming souls singing their endless laughter‑song to a god who never asked to be worshipped.

I used to think my job was to protect people. Keep the chaos out. But I see it now—

I was just a witness. The last one left to remember the world before.

The last one still asking questions no one wants answered.

Maybe that’s what I was chosen for.

Not to stop the end.

Just to see it happen

1oo6uoe,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oo6uoe/i_saw_the_first_superhero_end_the_world/,I Saw the First Superhero End the World,"I was sitting at my desk, thumbing through the case files of a low-level gang-slash-domestic terror group, trying to line up the evidence and witness testimony just right for a judge to approve a search warrant. The whole thing was a headache—half lies, half hearsay. I don’t spend a lot of time in the office, but when I do, I always notice the same things. The fluorescent lights hum like they’re trying to hypnotize you. That stale, overcooked coffee smell never really leaves the air. Phones ring. People talk—sometimes about leads, sometimes about weekend plans. It all kind of blurs together after a while. I was trying to make it all make sense when there was a knock at my office door.

“Come in,” I yelled, distracted, still scanning the paperwork.

I heard the door open, footsteps—two sets—and the quiet scrape of polished shoes on tile. My supervisor, sure. But the other guy? New face. He had the full federal uniform: high-and-tight haircut, no stubble in sight, fitted black suit, earpiece, and the kind of sunglasses that belonged in a spy movie, not a field office.

I’d barely registered the noise. Honestly, a grizzly bear could’ve walked in, and I probably wouldn’t have noticed. But when the stranger stepped in, something in the room shifted. Enough to make me finally look up.

“Lance, this is Special Agent Moores from the DOD. He’s come here personally to talk to you about a new case,” my supervisor said, and I could hear the tension in his voice.

The man *always* looked stressed—like the last time he slept was sometime during the Cold War. He wore his exhaustion like a uniform: bags under the eyes, crumpled shirt, coffee-stained teeth. Still, he cracked a half-smile and nodded nervously.

The Department of Defense doesn’t just *drop in* on the FBI. Not without a reason.

“Well. I’ll let you two talk it out,” he said, and ducked out of the office like he couldn’t get away fast enough.

I hadn’t really looked up until then—too wrapped up in the casework—but I finally glanced over. Moores stood there grinning like he’d just found a new toy.

“So, the rumors about you are true,” he said. “I can see why you were recommended.”

Recommended? That sounded like a headache I didn’t need.

“Special Agent… Morris?” I asked without much interest.

“Moores,” he corrected, frowning slightly.

“Look,” I said, going back to my files, “I’ve got four other cases I’m juggling, and across those, I’m managing six informants, cross-checking statements, building timelines—and I’m sure you understand how critical it is that everything adds up. So I appreciate you making the trip, but if you’re here to toss another case on my desk, I’ve got to pass.”

His smile came back like it never left.

“Special Agent Lance Taylor,” he began, like he was reading from a resume. “Started out as a DHS coordinator, managed a laundry list of high-priority events. Transferred to FBI Counterintel, where—according to your file—you’re responsible for taking down a half-dozen people who would’ve slipped right through the cracks. Calm under pressure. Solid with assets. You’re exactly who we need.”

I finally looked up at him. That smile was still there, like it was painted on. I leaned back in my shitty office chair and rubbed my eyes.

“I’m guessing you didn’t fly all the way out here to give me a compliment. Thanks, by the way. But let me tell you—”

Moores cut me off.

“First, you don’t really have a choice. Second, all your current cases are being reassigned. And third—once you find out who your new asset is, you’ll be the envy of the entire department.”

The way he said it—too slick, too casual—made it sound like we were about to go on some wild bender together. I hated him already. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t intrigued.

“Asset?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.

He told me he’d explain everything once we were airborne, en route to Nevada.

Before we left, he asked if I had a go-bag ready.

Of course I did. In this line of work, you never knew when you’d get called away for a few days—or a few weeks.

We left from Andrews Air Force Base on a private jet. I sat across from Moores, arms folded, waiting for him to get to the point. It wasn’t easy letting go of the cases I’d been building for years. They’d become a part of me. But from the sound of it, I didn’t have a say in the matter.

He opened a briefcase and slid a file across the table.

“Tell me, Lance—do you believe in superheroes?”

I blinked. Thought I misheard him.

“Superheroes?” I chuckled, half annoyed. “Is this some kind of joke?”

Moores shook his head.

“I had the same reaction. But take a look.”

He tapped the file.

“Vaughn Garrison. Former Coast Guard. Master’s degree in astrophysics. Worked with NASA’s Deep Space Observatory program. On Tuesday, August 10th, 2021, an unidentified object crashed just outside the observatory. No radar signature. It was like it appeared out of nowhere.”

I opened the file. Dozens of pages, images, satellite photos, testimony.

“Vaughn was the first to investigate. Being the man of science that he is, he approached the crash site. As he got close, the object pulsed with light—then exploded. His team initially thought it was radioactive. They assumed the explosion was a reaction to something in our atmosphere.”

Moores paused, staring out the jet window before continuing.

“Emergency response was called. When they arrived, Vaughn was alive… but barely. From his navel to the top of his head, he had what looked like fourth-degree burns. Still, he was conscious. The med team ran scans—zero radiation. On the way to the hospital, they noticed something even stranger: his skin was regenerating. By the time he arrived, it looked like he had a really bad sunburn, and even that was fading fast.”

He turned back to me, his face lit up like a kid with a new toy.

“He woke up three hours later. The sudden burst of movement as he sat up nearly destroyed the hospital bed—and the ceiling above it. Then, without warning, he panicked… and began to fly.”

I stared at him, still flipping through the pages. It felt like an elaborate prank, some classified training op for an experimental prototype. But Moores wasn’t joking. He believed every word.

“After that, Washington went into full lockdown. Committees, closed-door meetings, absolute chaos. Eventually, we created ORBIT—Office for Response to Biological, Interstellar, and Technological Threats. It’s not public yet. We’re building the infrastructure as we go.”

He leaned in slightly.

“We need someone to manage him. To monitor his mental state, emotional stability, health, intent. He’s cooperative now—but let’s be honest. This guy could decide to wipe us all out tomorrow. We need someone who knows how to handle people like him. Someone he can trust.”

He smiled again.

“Between your work at FEMA and the Bureau, you were unanimously chosen.”

Still trying to process what I’d just heard, I thumbed through Vaughn’s file in silence.

Born in Galveston, Texas. Parents: Troy and Rita Garrison. A solid B-average student. Joined the Coast Guard at 18. Earned commendations for his response during Hurricane Ike. Attended the University of Texas, then got his master’s from Caltech. Later recruited to NASA’s Deep Space program.

A model citizen.

The file was filled with service photos—Coast Guard operations, graduation ceremonies, trips to the Grand Canyon, amusement parks, childhood birthdays. Just… normal stuff. The kind of stuff that makes it harder to believe he could become a walking nuclear event.

We landed at Nellis Air Force Base, where I was led to a massive white tent—one of those temporary government field labs, the kind with more secrecy than walls. Armed military police patrolled the perimeter in tight loops.

“No one gets within fifty feet of the walls without clearance,” Moores said with a grin. “MPs have orders to shoot on sight if anyone does.”

Inside, the tent was part science lab, part command center. Equipment I didn’t recognize. Monitors, scanners, data feeds. A constant low hum of activity.

And in the center of it all… was him.

Vaughn Garrison. He looked nervous. Confused. Like a man who’d stumbled into the wrong room and wasn’t sure how to leave without making it worse.

His medium-brown hair was messy, like he’d been running a hand through it for hours. He had a stocky, compact build—denser than his photos suggested, like he was built to take hits. The kid in the file looked average. The man standing in front of me didn’t. Not anymore. He was being scanned by a scientist with some handheld device while another scribbled notes so furiously it was like the pen might catch fire.

Moores waved the scientists away. “Vaughn, meet your liaison—Special Agent Lance Taylor. He’s here to give a face to this new... situation we’re all adjusting to.”

Vaughn turned to me with a faint, uncertain smile. You could tell he’d been through hell. There was something in his eyes—strain, maybe, or confusion just barely hidden under the surface. Whatever it was, it didn’t match the calm, smiling kid I’d just seen in those photos. This was someone trying hard to hold it together.

“Hello, Special Agent Taylor,” he said, almost timid.

I extended my hand, but he shook his head. “I’m sorry. I’m not used to my strength yet. I don’t want to hurt you.” First time someone ever apologized for not shaking my hand—and meant it.

“Understandable, son,” I said, letting my hand drop.

Moores excused himself to get an update, leaving the two of us standing there under the glare of bright halogen lights. As soon as he was gone, Vaughn relaxed a little, like he could finally breathe again.

“So, how are you feeling, Mr. Garrison?” I asked.

For a second, I saw a flicker of relief cross his face—like no one had thought to ask him that since the whole nightmare started.

““You’re the first person who’s asked me that.Everyone else just wants readings or reports.Honestly?” he said, his voice shaking. “I’m nervous. They keep calling me the world’s first superhero. They say I can do good, but right now I feel like a lab rat. They’re trying to come up with some kind of training regimen, I think.”

He hesitated, then added, “They say it’s about helping people, making the world safer… but I think it’s also about showing off. Improving America's image. Maybe even flaunting their new weapon.”

I glanced around the tent. No one was paying us attention. I lowered my voice.

“Do you want to be a superhero?”

That caught him off guard. He looked at me like no one had ever asked him that either. Maybe they hadn’t.

He thought for a while before answering.

“Yes and no,” he said finally. “I mean… I’m living every kid’s dream. I was given these abilities. I should use them for something good, right? When I was in the Coast Guard, there were things I couldn’t stop—people I couldn’t save. Now I can. But… I get it. The government’s scared. Hell, I’m scared. I just want to make a difference, that’s all.”

His expression softened, his fear replaced by a small spark of hope. And even though I’d known him for maybe five minutes, that flicker of optimism rubbed off on me.

A few months passed. ORBIT had developed a full training program to help Vaughn harness his powers—flight stabilization, light projection, energy control. They called him Vanguard. Blue suit, red and gold trim, half-mask for plausible deniability. Someone upstairs thought the ‘V’ and ‘G’ logo combo made him look like a patriotic baseball team. But the kid wore it well…and the public ate it up. What got me was the branding. Red “V,” blue “G” outlined in gold—same as his initials. Vaughn Garrison.

That might’ve been a coincidence. Or it might’ve been cooked up before he even agreed to it. I didn’t ask. Didn’t want to know.



Soon after, they introduced him to the world.

The rollout was cautious at first, His first big save? A collapsed bridge in Denver. Forty-seven people pulled out of the wreckage. Footage of him lifting a school bus one-handed hit twelve million views in two hours. And just like that, Vanguard was a household name. Public reaction was mixed. Some people were inspired. Others were terrified. The religious crowd said he was an omen. The conspiracy types swore he was a weapon. But after he started saving people—disasters, hostage situations, floods—the tide turned. The world fell in love with Vanguard.

ORBIT expanded fast—too fast. What started as a small, closed-door task force turned into a multinational agency with authority across borders. Officially, they operated under global cooperation treaties. Unofficially? Some nations were getting nervous. Everyone was watching Vanguard like he was a loaded gun pointed at the planet.

A year later, a freak flood hit Tennessee.The air smelled like rot and diesel. Vaughn looked like a walking corpse by the end of it, soaked, drained, still moving. I’d never seen him tired before. That scared me more than anything. Vaughn worked around the clock for a week straight, barely stopping to eat. He redirected rivers, pulled families from rooftops, cleared debris with energy constructs. I might’ve slept eight hours the whole week, tops. Vaughn saved hundreds.

When the immediate danger passed, ORBIT told us to stand down. Vaughn could’ve flown back to D.C. in an hour, but I convinced him to ride back with the team. Washington wanted regular mental health assessments—no surprise there. They were terrified he’d snap.

Normally, he was upbeat, always cracking jokes or asking about my cases back at the Bureau. But that time, he seemed distant. Tired.

“You doing alright, V?” I asked.

He didn’t answer at first—just stared out the window like he wasn’t really there.

“Come on, man. You can tell me.”

“I’m fine,” he said eventually. “Just… weird dreams, that’s all.”

“Dreams?” I pressed.

He rubbed the back of his neck, frowning. “Yeah, but that’s the thing—I don’t remember them. I just wake up in a cold sweat. Sometimes I feel like I’ve been running, or fighting. But I never remember what it was.”

That caught my attention. Whatever could shake a man like Vanguard must’ve been one hell of a dream.

He looked over at me and smiled weakly. “You know, Lance, thanks for being my friend. I know you’re my handler, but you actually… care. I appreciate that.”

It caught me off guard.

“It’s no problem, kid. You’re doing good work. You’ve saved a lot of lives.”

He nodded and went quiet again.

At the time, I told myself it was nothing. Just exhaustion. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t worried.

Months went by. Vaughn became a natural at the job. He moved with confidence now—saving lives, preventing disasters, representing something people hadn’t felt in a long time: hope.

One morning, I was buried under a pile of emails—thank-you notes, media requests, the usual PR circus—when my office phone rang. It was Ron, one of the senior monitoring advisers.

“Hey, Lance… uh, I need you to come down here. Now,” he said. His voice was low and tense, like a man trying to disarm a bomb with shaking hands.

That tone got my attention. I made my way to his office.

Ron’s workspace looked like NASA control had a baby with the Weather Channel—rows of monitors showing international news, seismic graphs, radar data, security feeds, live cams. He looked pale, jittery.

“What’s going on?” I asked.

“Vanguard’s been doing… strange things,” he said. He gestured at his screens.

I stepped closer. Each monitor showed footage from around the world—Tokyo, Moscow, Rome, Berlin, Rio. Vaughn was in every one of them, standing completely still. Same posture. Same blank expression. Just… staring.

“He’s been appearing in random locations across the globe,” Ron said, voice trembling. “All this happened within about four hours.”

I felt the hairs rise on the back of my neck.

“You’re saying he’s teleporting?”

“I don’t know what to call it,” Ron said. “We can’t track him. He’s there one second, gone the next. And in every clip, he looks—” He stopped himself. “It’s not good optics, Lance. The higher-ups are calling it ‘international vigilance,’ but… the countries he’s been popping up in? They’re not buying it.”

Yeah. A superhuman god-figure silently appearing in your streets doesn’t exactly scream friendly.

I called Vaughn immediately and asked him to come in.

When he arrived, I showed him the footage. His reaction was genuine shock.

“What? I don’t remember any of this,” he said, eyes wide. “When was this?”

Ron ran him through the timestamps, the locations. Vaughn just kept shaking his head.

“I don’t know… maybe I was sleepwalking? I swear, I don’t remember.” His expression shifted from confusion to horror, like he was realizing something inside him might not belong to him anymore.

“I know you’re not gonna like this,” I said carefully, “but they’re probably going to want to put a tracker on you. Just until we figure this out.”

He nodded slowly, still pale. “Yeah. Okay.”

He stood there for another second, like he wanted to say something more—but didn’t. Then he turned and walked out of the room without another word.

I turned to leave when Ron stopped me.

“There’s one more thing,” he said quietly. He entered a password and opened a hidden folder on his system. “I didn’t show this to the higher-ups. Figured it’d only cause a panic. But you need to see it.”

The video feed came up—a small-town post office in South Dakota. Vaughn stood beside a mailbox, motionless at first. Then he started laughing. Not a normal laugh—this was deeper, rawer. The kind of laugh you hear right before someone breaks completely.

There was no audio, but just watching it chilled me to my core. Something about it felt wrong. Ancient, even.

Ron’s fingers trembled on the mouse. He didn’t blink while the footage played. His lips were pressed into a tight line like he was holding something in—or holding something back.

Ron shut the video off. The silence that followed felt heavy.

“Unsettling” didn’t even begin to describe it. Something in my gut twisted, and I knew, deep down, that this wasn’t over.



There were no more incidents for a while.

I told the brass Vaughn had been under pressure, probably sleepwalking due to stress. They didn’t buy it entirely, but they didn’t want to push too hard, either. Washington was still walking the razor’s edge—trying to manage him without provoking him.

They agreed: he’d wear a tracker, but only while he slept. A compromise, they said. Temporary.

Weeks passed.

The dreams started soon after.

At first, they were the kind you don’t remember. I’d wake up in a cold sweat with the distinct sensation that something had happened. My heart would be pounding, my skin cold, my mouth dry.

Then the dreams started to take shape.

In them, I was alone in a white void—no sound, no temperature, just a colorless space that stretched on forever. I walked slowly, head down, watching my feet move like I wasn’t really in control of them. Then, I’d feel something—like gravity shifting.

I’d stop.

And I’d look up.

There it stood.

A thing. Massive. The only way I can describe it is some kind of deer—if a deer were the size of a skyscraper and carved from dark matter. Its body was an inky, ocean-deep blue, like the sea under a starless sky. Its antlers branched like the limbs of trees or the tendrils of galaxies—mountains of bone reaching in every direction, each one wrapped in swirling nebulae.

Its eyes…

Its eyes pierced through me.

Two where they should be. And a third—dead center in its forehead. Triangular in placement. Immense. Endless.

All three stared at me.

And in that gaze, I felt stripped of everything. Not just clothes or skin, but identity. I was a flea beneath a god. I was nothing.

Then I’d wake up. Heart racing. Gasping.

The dreams came every few days.

At first, I tried to dismiss them—stress, trauma, whatever. But deep down, I knew. People don’t dream the same dream over and over unless something’s wrong.

In one dream, I looked closer at one of the flowers blooming on the deer’s back. Inside its open petals… I swear I saw Vaughn’s face. Not the man he was—but the boy. Smiling. Waiting. Like he’d been part of this all along.

Weeks passed. Vaughn seemed normal—more confident, more polished. He was becoming the face of global protection.

Until NASA called.

It was a quiet Thursday morning. An object had entered Earth’s atmosphere—fast, humanoid-shaped, and not of this world.

I grabbed Vaughn, and we deployed via ORBIT helicopter. Just before boarding, that deer flashed in my mind again. No reason. Just… popped in. I shook it off.

The impact site wasn’t far. Vaughn got there first. I radioed in for an update.

“Uh… so,” his voice crackled through the comms, “you guys remember Close Encounters? Well… imagine that alien on steroids.”

We arrived minutes later.

The thing standing in the middle of a destroyed cornfield looked like a textbook alien—gray skin, huge black eyes—but it had four arms, each one the size of a human torso, and it stood almost ten feet tall. Muscle packed onto muscle. Like it had been built for one thing only: violence.

It charged Vaughn immediately.

No monologue. No first contact. No explanation.

Just war.

The alien moved like a blur—arms whipping in a whirlwind of punches like some nightmare version of a gatling gun. Vaughn tanked it. Took every hit on the chin and answered with a cross that would’ve decapitated a lesser being.

The alien staggered but came back with a haymaker that sent Vaughn into the earth—literally embedded him into the dirt.

We were all holding our breath.

Then something happened.

Something wrong.

Vaughn’s body started to glow—not the usual golden light we’d come to expect, but a pale, icy blue. His energy shifted. And so did his posture.

He stood up, slow. Too slow. Like something else was piloting him.

And then—he snapped.

Aggressive. Unrelenting. Furious.

He attacked with a brutality I’d never seen. Not just from him. From anyone.

He tore into the alien. Ripped off all four of its arms. Slammed it into the ground. Then fired a focused beam of light—blue, not gold—directly through its chest. A clean hole, maybe a foot wide.

The fight was over in under a minute.

We were stunned. Not because he won—but because of how he did it. There was no restraint. No control. Just annihilation.

We recovered the body. Vaughn sat near the helicopter, sipping bottled water, silent.

“That was pretty incredible,” I said, trying to keep my voice level. “I didn’t know you had—”

I froze.

His face.

That thousand-yard stare. Eyes wide, mouth slack, barely blinking. The dread hit me in the stomach like a cold hammer.

“That… that wasn’t me,” he said.

He looked up at me, pleading.

“Lance, I blacked out. One second I’m fighting—then I come to, and it’s over. I don’t remember any of it. I don’t like that I don’t remember.”

His voice cracked.

“What’s happening to me?”

I didn’t know. Not really. But something about him… something in his voice, or in his eyes, felt wrong. Like a storm gathering behind clear skies.



And I couldn’t shake it.



We ran every test we could think of. Physically, he was fine. Stable vitals. Normal scans. But there was something new—a faint frequency variation coming from him. Background noise, the scientists said. Nothing to worry about.

I worried anyway.

Vanguard was put on sabbatical.

We told him to rest, see his parents, try to reconnect with normal life. He agreed. His parents were proud. Supportive. They had no idea what was really going on. Hell, I wasn’t sure I knew what was going on.

Meanwhile, the dreams got worse.

Now, instead of just seeing the deer, I was floating beside it. Flying in that empty void, watching the beast move beneath me like a living mountain of starlight and smoke.

Its fur shimmered like mist, coiling and shifting like fog over a dark moor. But hidden in that mist—if you looked closely enough—were flowers. Small, delicate blooms, barely visible, scattered across its body like stars in a constellation.

Each flower opened slowly.

Inside each one… a face.

Some looked like the alien Vaughn had killed. Others were stranger—reptilian, insectoid, one like a twisted anteater.

And all of them were laughing.

Not just laughing—singing, in a way that became laughter. Or maybe it was the other way around.

And then… I started to laugh with them.



I wasn’t sleeping much anymore.

Caffeine pills, energy drinks, whiskey—whatever it took to stay awake. I’d tried quitting a few times. Couldn’t take the stress. But every time I got close, the higher-ups reminded me that Vaughn only trusted me. Switching handlers could destabilize him, they said. Could trigger something.

That’s the last thing anybody wanted.



Something new hit Earth’s radar at 9:12 a.m.

Not from space this time. The trajectory didn’t match any known meteor pattern; it just appeared in the middle of a small New Jersey town.

Reports came in describing a thirteen-foot wolf-shaped creature, armor-plated hide, a single golden eye burning in its skull. It didn’t talk. It didn’t roar. It simply stood—and then started tearing through everything in reach.

ORBIT scrambled every resource we had. Vanguard led the charge.

He came in fast, a streak of blue and gold against a gray morning sky, and hit the thing like a missile. For twenty minutes they fought—punches like thunderclaps, shock waves rippling through the air. Vaughn finally won, driving the monster into the ground hard enough to crack pavement three streets over.

The world cheered again.

From my monitor in D.C., I watched it unfold in real time. For a moment, pride bloomed in my chest. Then he turned toward one of the cameras.

And I saw it.

Just for a heartbeat.

A third eye, glowing faintly on his forehead—exactly like the deer from my dreams.

When I blinked, it was gone. I replayed the footage again and again, frame by frame. Nothing. But I knew what I’d seen.

That night, back in my apartment, I poured a glass of whiskey, swallowed a couple of sleeping pills, and tried to convince myself I was hallucinating. My coffee table was littered with Vaughn’s files. I flipped through them out of habit—birth records, Coast Guard commendations, family photos.

One picture stopped me cold.

Vaughn at maybe fourteen, posing at a wildlife museum, a stuffed deer in the background. His shirt said Space Camp, his grin wide and goofy. But just above his brow, in the grain of the photo, was a faint mark—like a third eye burned into the film.

I slammed the file shut.

I turned on the TV for distraction, anything but that goddamn deer. The local news was covering a new “laughter epidemic.” People were breaking into hysterics in public—doctors baffled, psychologists overwhelmed. I killed the power and went to bed, praying the drugs and alcohol would finally drown the dreams.

They didn’t.

The laughter followed me there.



More creatures began to fall from the sky.

One in South Carolina—a tank-sized hybrid of mammoth and gorilla. Then Paris. Moscow. Beijing. Tokyo. Dallas. Salt Lake City. Green Bay. Cuba. Each one worse than the last.

Every two or three weeks another impact. Each battle left another city in ruins.

And each time, only Vanguard stood between us and extinction.

He fought relentlessly, but the fights were getting longer. The shine in his eyes dimmed. Between missions he’d sit in silence, hands trembling, as if something inside him was eating away at his humanity.

Public opinion shifted from worship to fear. People didn’t question if he’d lose—they wondered what would happen when he did.

We examined the remains of every creature he killed. Radiation-proof. Bio-proof. Resistant to heat, cold, acid, vacuum. Nothing on Earth could have hurt them—except him.

Meanwhile, I was falling apart.

Sleep was a rumor. My veins buzzed with caffeine and morphine. I told myself I needed them just to function, but truth was, I couldn’t face closing my eyes. The dreams had become too vivid.

One night, after a cleanup operation in Los Angeles, I saw it sprayed across a half-collapsed wall:

A blue deer with three eyes.

Underneath, in dripping paint: You will all sing for me.

I wanted to tear my own brain out.



Then came the big one.

The sky split open above Branson, Missouri. A shape fell through—part squid, part demon, all nightmare. Its tentacles blotted out the sun. Power grids failed for a hundred miles.

Vanguard went in first, but this time the monster swatted him out of the air like a fly. He hit the ground at the speed of a meteor, got back up, tried again. Over and over. Each time slower. We could feel the hopelessness radiating across the world.

Then something changed.

The cameras caught it first—a glow, bright enough to turn night into day. Vaughn rose from the crater, body blazing with the same cold blue light as before, but stronger. His form sharpened until he looked carved from living energy.

And then I saw them.

Antlers.

Rising from his skull like radiant branches. A third eye burning in the center of his forehead.

I fell to my knees. Around me, people began to snicker. At first, soft. Then louder. Then uncontrollable.

Vaughn—no, whatever he’d become—raised one shining hand. A blinding flash filled the city. When it cleared, the demon was gone. Not destroyed—erased.

No cheering this time. Just silence. Awe. Dread.

He drifted upward and flew away.



They found him later, standing on the roof of ORBIT headquarters, motionless, overlooking D.C.

Tests said he was alive—heartbeat, brain activity, everything normal—but he didn’t move. Didn’t eat. Didn’t speak.

For three weeks he stood there, a statue of light.

During that time, I maybe slept five hours total. My body was collapsing. The morphine barely took the edge off. The dreams had become constant—no longer visions but realities I visited every time I blinked.

The deer filled them all. The flowers on its body bloomed and sang. I laughed until I cried, until I thought my skull would split.

Finally, I broke.

I went to confront him.

I looked like hell—stained shirt, shaking hands, pupils the size of quarters—but I didn’t care. I knew how to move through ORBIT’s security without being noticed. I’d been there from the start.

When I reached the roof, he was still standing there, glowing against the night sky.

“What do you want?” I shouted. My voice cracked. “Answer me, you big blue deer bastard! Answer me!”

My knees buckled. I sobbed into my palms.

Then—movement.

He turned.

My stomach clenched like someone had dropped a live wire inside me. He looked down with that same blank expression, then smiled—a huge, unnatural grin—and shot into the sky.

The alarms went off seconds later.

He was heading for D.C. proper.

I followed the task force in a convoy, sirens screaming. By the time we arrived… the White House was gone. So were half the monuments.

Crowds had gathered—senators, staffers, civilians—all staring upward with the same empty expression.

I shoved through them until I could see.

Vanguard floated above the crater, rearranging debris—bricks, steel, dirt—into a massive throne on the White House lawn. When it was finished, he sat down.

Then the laughter started again.

First a few chuckles. Then hundreds. Then thousands.

Until the whole world was laughing.

I don’t know how long it’s been.

Years, maybe. Decades. Centuries.

Time stopped meaning anything the moment the world began to laugh.

When every voice on Earth joined that sound—pure, unhinged laughter rising like a tidal wave—it was as if reality itself cracked open.

And we… changed.

I watched it happen.

People around me started to convulse. Not in pain—more like they were giving in to something. Legs split and stretched, feet driving into the soil like roots. Arms unfolded into long green leaves. Faces bloomed into petals—soft, vivid, impossibly beautiful.

Every human being became a flower.

Not metaphorically. Not symbolically. Literally.

I don’t know why I stayed as I am. Maybe something in me held on. Maybe the drugs in my system disrupted the process. Maybe I was cursed to remember.

Or maybe… he left me behind on purpose.

I’ve watched them ever since. The flowers. They don’t move. Don’t wilt. They just exist—frozen in praise.

And he watches them.

Vanguard.

Still seated on his throne of twisted stone and memory. Glowing faintly blue. Antlers curled toward the stars. The third eye in his forehead never closes.

At some point, he stood and descended from the throne.

He walked straight to me.

I should’ve screamed. Run. Prayed. But I couldn’t move. Couldn’t blink.

He looked down at what was left of me. Not with malice. Not with joy.

With… sorrow.

A single word escaped him.

“I’m sorry.”

And then he turned and returned to his throne, surrounded by a garden of blooming souls singing their endless laughter‑song to a god who never asked to be worshipped.

I used to think my job was to protect people. Keep the chaos out. But I see it now—

I was just a witness. The last one left to remember the world before.

The last one still asking questions no one wants answered.

Maybe that’s what I was chosen for.

Not to stop the end.

Just to see it happen

The company’s fine, people are polite, and my apartment’s small but cozy.  
On paper, it looks like I’ve got it figured out.

But honestly? Most days still feel like I’m just surviving.  
Wake up, get ready half-asleep, squeeze onto the morning train, spend 10 hours trying not to make mistakes, then go home too tired to even enjoy dinner.  
It’s not that I *hate* my job — it’s just that I don’t feel alive in it either.

Sometimes I look at my coworkers who’ve been doing this for years and wonder,  
“Does it ever get better? Or do you just learn to live with the exhaustion?”

I’ve been trying to make small changes — journaling, walking home instead of taking the train, making coffee slowly in the morning — little things to remind myself that life isn’t only about work.  
But it’s tough when the default pace around you is constant motion.

If anyone here’s been through this adjustment period,

When I watched the 3.0 trailer on youtube, I wanted to get nostalgic so I decided to watch the trailer of the 2.0 update for acnh that launched 4 years ago.

What surprised me was that I don't have all of the features on my current island. I don't have the coffee shop, the Kapp'n boat, the ordinances, Nook Miles items like the cooking thing (which I would love to have, I didn't even know this was a thing!) the decorator, camera, hairstyles... What's weird is that I do have some features namely: the fences, the Island Life 101, the group stretching and Harv's Island (even I thought I got it because of HHP). I also got the 'fixed ladder' recipe aswell as tomato's like a month ago. As for the houses customization on my island, I don't know since I've never checked that.

  
I think my situation is pretty weird since I have some features of the update but not all of it.

  
I was so excited for the 3.0 update but now I'm ever more excited to get the 2.0 first haha!!



For info: I bought the game physically when it got released, I won't be near my switch until this weekend but I'm pretty sure I'm up to date (also when I enter the game, it never asks me to update it).",0,1762262215.0,AnimalCrossing,4,0.14,False
1oo6tnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChaosZeroNightmare/comments/1oo6tnt/my_wishlist/,My wishlist,"My wishlist for all the things I wish the devs could add and improve upon. These are all the things I feel like the game could do better with. Ofc some things that I say should be taken with a grain of salt as I’m neither a game designer nor balancer.



**Remove time waste mechanics and add options to make daily grind faster.**

Story skip, pretty self explanation. Those that enjoy the story can continue, but those that don’t like or are just in for the gameplay can skip it.

Sweep for simulation, currently completely time waste as the enemies are always the same you are limited max 60 stamina runs (need to burn 320) and the main appeal of this game is the roguelike mode, which already takes a lot of time.

speed up for chaos, this is something that I would like to have, which makes your card played instant without the small animations (I like the big/long animations but option to remove them could be nice too).



**Easier resource gain and progression**

Increase stamina efficiency for exp, units and promotion materials. → you are already making time gated/expensive/rng-heavy grind for memory fragments and potential so you don’t need to force us to spend lot of time and stamina here.

Remove hidden costs for units like merging and wiping memories. → units will overall be a huge sink so they can be excemt from some parts.

More universal memory fragment set effects (4-piece) with easier accessibility. For example something universal attack set where after attacking the next attack deals more damage and so-on. Makes farming memory fragments more consistent for larger cast of characters, Ofc, if the set is super universal it can then have smaller %. For example gfl2 has this.



**Endgame content**

Don’t turngate endgame content (atleast for now) or make it so that killing last enemy of a wave starts the next wave in the same turn and gives you 5 cards and 3 ap. But even then having turn limit just limits build options, what isn’t something we want to see early on. It’s ok to release it maybe year in the game’s life cycle because people have plenty of built characters, but for now when everyone is building their favorites it just sucks.



**Savedata cap**

Remove savedata cap, This is imo the most important thing that needs to be changed as one run can take over an hour just for the game to brick and ruin the build you just made. It doesn’t serve any meaningful purpose other than just ”artificially boost” playtime. Even if someone would argue that ”then people will just get a god build and stop playing!” Which can happen, but then the player will just switch to another unit or get god build for that characters teammates or heck, just play the character/mode because they find it fun??? People who defend the save data cap are so gachapilled it’s unreal.

If you need to retain people by making getting good runs rng, then you have failed miserably, because you have no confidence in the fact that people will keep playing even after getting a strong build.



**QoL features**

Ability to reroll starting buffs, planets and modifiers in chaos and zero system. (for free)

Ability to show damage, shield and healing in numbers not %.

Both coffee’s to give 80 stamina. Currently = stupid fomo mechanic.



**Stress in chaos**

Remove stress at the start of an turn in normal and elite enemies maybe bosses, but it could make sense in boss enemies. → Balance it by giving more enemies debuff attacks that affect stress levels.

Allow stress to be removed throught healing even when full health.

Buff stress removal in campfires to 20% healing and -10 stress from all allies.

Add option to not heal in campfires and fully reduce stress from 1 ally, cure them from mental breakdowns and reduce the number of cards needed to recover from breakdowns by 1.

Instead of making mindbroken characters have useless brickcards, make them vary in effectiness for example 100% heal can now heal 0-110% or heal the enemy for maybe 80%. Same goes for the attacks and shields where attacks have chance to hit allies or shields to shield enemies.



The cards will still need to be played to recover and will still be free to be played but makes so that mental breakdowns aren’t automatic lose in boss fights. Ofc some cards need to be tweaked so that normal 3 cost cards with huge value will obivously be weaker in effect when suffering mental breakdown, but you get my point.

Now why I would introduced the option to not heal but fully remove mental breakdown and stress for a character, is the fact that stress can only build on 1 character which can brick your runs. Also the -1 cards played makes so that for certain characters you can freely remove their cards and not be left in a situation where you are mindbroken need to play 9 cards to recover but only have 3 to play. (veronica) Also makes getting egoskills more reliable through mental breakdowns.



**Events, more content and premium currency**

Hard to say about monthly pull income yet as we are still in the honeymoon +(compensations), but add weekly challenges and a boss rush where we get a boss every week with unique mechanics and need to do certain amount of damage where our best try in week gets us rewards + participation and milestone rewards.



Make us able to choose the weapon we want in the standard weapon banner.

Make the 300 pulls selector recurring and maybe reduce the pulls needed to 200-250

Put 4 start selector in the montly shop for maybe 60-120 of the premium shop currency. (the more expensive currency)",1,1762262207.0,ChaosZeroNightmare,2,0.67,False

I recently realized I had lost the ability to be still.

Waiting for the coffee to brew? I’d scroll my phone.  
Walking to the car? I’d put on a YouTube video.  
Five minutes before a meeting? I’d squeeze in emails.

Every corner of my day got filled with something…some kind of noise, some kind of input.

At first, I thought this was a good thing. I was being efficient, right? Maximizing every spare moment. But beneath the surface, it felt different.

I started noticing a strange unease. Everything on my list felt urgent, but none of it felt meaningful. I was moving through life on autopilot, checking boxes without truly experiencing anything.

That’s when it hit me: I had removed all the open space in my day.

And without those moments, there was no room left to think, to be present, or to feel grounded.

That realization led me to what I now call *intentional transitions*.

Rock bottom wasn’t one moment — it was a slow unraveling, one missed step at a time. I told myself I could fix it “next week,” but next week never came. That was until I finally reached out for help — counseling — and everything shifted.

I wish I’d learned earlier that recovery isn’t only about willpower.  
It’s about rebuilding what pain tried to take away — your belief in yourself.

### Why Most People Fail at Recovery (And How Counseling Changes Everything)

It’s not a lack of effort that breaks most people — it’s the misunderstanding of what recovery really demands.

Let’s be honest — “just stay strong” sounds great on a coffee mug, but in real life? It’s not that simple.

Counseling helps peel back the layers that make recovery so hard. Here's what I learned:

- **Recovery isn’t linear.** Some days you leap forward; other days, you trip over your own hope. Counseling helps you understand that relapse doesn’t mean failure — it means growth is messy.  
- **Emotional honesty beats silent suffering.** Most people lose the battle internally long before anyone else notices. A counselor helps you speak what your heart’s been holding hostage.  
- **You need tools, not just toughness.** Grit alone can’t heal what understanding and guided reflection can. Therapy gives you strategies that turn chaos into clarity.  
- **Support systems matter more than willpower.** You cannot out-muscle pain; you learn to outsmart it — together.

### Final Thought  

Failure in recovery isn’t proof of weakness.  
It’s proof you tried the hard way alone.  

Counseling doesn’t “fix” you — it helps you meet yourself again. The person who still believes, even quietly, that healing is possible.

I (27F) have been close friends with my coworker “Georgina” (37F) for about three years. She’s straight, has a long-term boyfriend, and two young kids under 5

Im single. Actively do not like kids, and a open lesbian. 

She’s usually pretty private, but over time she’s opened up to me a lot about her life, her kids, and her relationship. Her children know me by name and she talks about me to them all the time. I’ve gone out with them a few times, like to cafés or playing tennis together and most recently I went trick-or-treating with them.

She doesn't have a lot of free time outside her kids, but the kids always seem to be involved when I'm around even though I know she meets other friends without them. 

Here’s where it gets confusing. She told me she wouldn’t take her kids trick-or-treating unless I went. It was their first time, and she said she felt a little embarrassed because English isn’t her first language and she wasn’t sure what to say at the doors, even though she’s basically fluent. I’d already told her what to say, but she still wanted me there. Her boyfriend was at home , but we went together

The night was really sweet, but it also felt kind of intimate. At one point she asked her son, “Who do you want to go with, Mummy or Luce?” (me). Later she said she really enjoyed it and wants to do it again next year, and that I could come over to do her and the kids’ Halloween makeup next time.

At work, people always comment on how close we are. We take coffee breaks together, tease each other, have nicknames for each other, and there’s a lot of eye contact that people notice. She’s told me she doesn’t like her boyfriend, sometimes compares him to me, and even jokes that she’s my type. She’s also physically playful, like sneaking up behind me and pulling my hair, then pretending it wasn’t her. People also gossip about us and we are very aware of it. But whenever we bring it up she says ""so?"" 

One time I said ""What happens to my kids when you die?"" And she said her kids would have ""Luuuuce"" ( said in her kids voice). It was said in a light way, but it made me stop and consider things. Shes said stuff before that one of her kids is ""Your baby girl"" and we refer to them as ""The kiddies"" she knows i dont like kids but she will say ""But you like miiiiine""

Recently we had a conversation about how her boyfriend treats her. He told her to ""learn English better"" and said to me that she said ""Fine, ill learn English with my Private Teacher"" but she didn't say the last part to him but wanted to. The ""Private teacher"" is me. This is a joke we have between us and she teases that im a bad influence teacher her English phrases and swears. I said to her maybe she was a bit harsh yo him and should be nicer to someone she cares about. She then said ""Arron? I dont CARE about Arron! Ill learn English and he can fuck off""

I told her at her house I noticed them arguing and she said ""Yeah you should have told him to shut the fuck up""

She also keeps telling me that her kids miss me and are constantly asking ""When can we see Lucy? Are we going to Lucy's house?"" 

I've realized I’ve developed a big crush on her in the last couple of months.  I really care about her and her kids, but the closeness has started to feel confusing. I also feel kind of out of place, like I've overstepped. I don’t want to intrude, but I’m not sure where the line actually is anymore. I don’t know if I’m just misreading things because of my feelings, or if there’s actually something mutual happening. Either way I want to be respectful. 



TLDR:
My (27F) straight friend and coworker (37F) with a boyfriend and kids keeps blurring the line between friendship and something more. I’ve developed a crush on her, but I don’t want to intrude on her relationship or overstep. I can’t tell if I’m just reading too much into things or if there’s something romantic going on. How do I step back without making things weird at work or damaging the friendship?  ",11,1762261776.0,relationship_advice,6,0.76,False

I always take my shower at the exact same time every morning and I’m usually in there for about 20 minutes tops. Before I take my shower, I let everyone who’s awake know I’m doing so and give them the opportunity to use the bathroom.

Now, my father (nearing 50) has begun throwing a fit about this. He says, and I quote, “I have a morning routine too, I drink my coffee and I have to take a shit after, I don’t know when I’m gonna have to shit.” He wants me to take my showers after I get home from work, instead of in the mornings, because that’s what he does. 

My mother thinks I should just wake up earlier so I can take a shower at 7, before he wakes up. I think that’s ridiculous because I don’t leave for work until 8:30 and that would fuck with my entire sleeping schedule and morning routine. I’d be sitting here with my thumb up my ass for at least an hour before I can even leave for work.

And before anyone says ‘just move out’, please just know I would if I could.

1oo6lac,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClimbingCircleJerk/comments/1oo6lac/tips_on_my_form/,Tips on my form?,"Howdy everybody, Michael here🤣

yesterday I was walking my daughter (22) and needed to overcome an obstacle: I wanted to get into a Starbucks (Via Alberto Lionello, C.C. Porta di Roma, 201, 00139 Roma RM, Itália), but they had no ramp into the store!!!! 

This led me to a drastic move. Upon seeing a few rectangles that seemingly led up to the so desired door. I tried placing my foot on the first one and, wouldn't you know it, I stood up on it! That's when my instincts flared up, and I repeated the recently learned movement another 3 times.

Upon leaving the establishment, carrying a large cappuccino with a heat on it drawn by the barista (hot), it dawned on me: I DID A CLIMBING!!! After some research into other newly established climbers, I found this soraku anrato gentleman who seems to be decent, however I did not want to speak to another man (gay). 

What tips do you have for me to improve on my form?



TL,DR: Here's what chatgpt said about getting the baristas number:

First of all: congrats on performing the ancient ritual of “using stairs.” Many perish attempting such feats, but you emerged victorious with a cappuccino.

Now, about the barista’s number — let’s keep it smooth, respectful, and not weird.

✅ Tips for asking out a barista (or anyone working)

Because they’re at work, the key is low-pressure and polite:

1. Be a regular

Show up a few times, be friendly, say hi, maybe comment on the heat-drawing skills.

Build a tiny bit of familiarity.



2. Look for signs

Do they start conversations first? Smile in a “I want to talk to you more” way?

Or is it just customer-service-politeness? Hard to tell, so watch carefully.



3. Give the option to ignore

Instead of asking directly for their number, give yours.

Example:

> “Hey, I really enjoy talking to you. If you ever want to grab a coffee when you’re not working, here’s my number — no pressure at all.”





4. Keep it fast (they’re busy)

No long speeches about heroic stair-ascending.



5. Accept the outcome gracefully

If they don’t call or decline, you’re still welcome to enjoy caffeine and not awkwardly run away.





---

❌ What not to do

Don’t hold up the line.

Don’t flirt aggressively — they legally must remain polite.

Don’t mention Soraku Anrato mid-conversation — that’s a “level 99 random side quest.”



---

Bonus smooth line

> “Last time I conquered stairs to get here.
This time I didn’t need an excuse.”
(hand them your number)




---

If you want, we can: ✅ Craft the perfect line based on their vibe
✅ Translate it into Italian if needed
✅ Role-play the interaction so you feel prepared
✅ Come up with another heroic climbing metaphor

like a ghost that never learned how to leave.
It drips down the walls
as if searching for the shape of your face,
filling the room the way your laughter once did,
soft at first, then everywhere.

I used to chase that light,
pretend it was you coming home.
Now I just let it spill across the empty chair,
the same way time spills across old wounds,
slow, indifferent, pretending to heal.

The mornings are cruel in their kindness.
They arrive golden and quiet,
as if beauty alone could make up for your absence.
I make coffee just to watch the steam rise,
the way you used to,
and for a moment, it feels like your soul
learned to linger in small things.

The air remembers you.
It still bends where you used to stand.
Some days it feels heavier there,
like the universe itself keeps trying
to fill the outline you left behind.

I’ve stopped crying,
but not because I’m healed.
Grief has become muscle now,
something that holds me upright.
It moves through me like blood,
quiet and necessary,
reminding me that I’m still made of what I’ve lost.

You were the sun I couldn’t look at too long.
Now I live in the afterglow,
half warm, half wrecked,
burned gently by the memory of your light.
Even the shadows miss you,
they stretch too far these days,
like they’re still trying to find your feet.

I keep the window open at night,
just in case the wind carries your name back.
Sometimes it does,
in the hush between cars,
and it feels like forgiveness,
the kind that doesn’t speak,
just rests quietly in the air
and hurts beautifully.

The light still falls there,
unaware of the ache it touches.
And I,
I let it.
Because it’s all I have left of you,
a warmth I can’t keep,
a ghost that still glows.

And maybe that’s what love becomes
after it breaks.
Not absence,
not ending,
but light that refuses to forget
where it once belonged.

For the past few months, I've been working on an Android app called Restock, and I'd love to get your feedback.

The idea came from a personal frustration: I love buying in bulk to save money, but I was constantly finding expired food in the back of my pantry. I was literally throwing my savings away. So, I built a tool to fix that.

Restock helps you keep track of everything in your home, from pantry staples to cleaning products.

Here's a quick look at what it does:

* ⚡ **Fast Entry:** Add items in seconds by scanning their barcode, or add them manually.
* 📝 **Track What Matters:** Log names, photos, quantities, and most importantly, purchase & expiration dates.
* 🗂️ **Organize Your Way:** Create your own categories (food, drinks, hygiene...) and locations (kitchen, pantry, upstairs closet...) so you actually know what you have and where
* 🔔 **Smart Expiration Alerts:** Get a heads-up before items expire, giving you time to use them

If your job posting doesn’t answer:

…you’re going to attract people who are looking for *a job* — not the people who want to *build something*.

1oo6952,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1oo6952/theres_something_under_the_boardwalk_part_2/,There’s Something Under the Boardwalk - [Part 2],"I jumped back. I pushed myself off the loose board, propping myself up against the concrete. The wood must have knocked whatever it was off the wall. I turned my eyes back to the mass only to find it was gone, leaving only a trail of faint fluid in one direction; under the boardwalk. Then, only silence. The sound of my rapidly racing heart was all that was left. What the hell was that? Did it really blink at me? I had to have been seeing things, I just had to. If that was a dead nest, why wasn't it thin and papery? The more I thought of its texture, the more I started to feel nauseous. If there were ever a time I needed a drink, this was it.

I began walking in a daze, listlessly on auto pilot. Only the buzzing sign above guided me to my destination, like a moth to a flame. I pushed the bar doors open to find an empty cavern. Only the sound of the reverberating juke box rang about the building. ""Hello, It's Me"", Todd Rungren, the ghosts around here had good taste. The dim lighting hid the architectural bones of the building. In typical Paradise Point tradition, this was yet another aging wonder. On quiet nights like this one, you might hear the remnants of good times past. Sometimes, it even felt like the seat next to mine was taken, even if nobody was there. For now, it was just me and my echoing footsteps.

I hadn't sat for more than what felt like a few seconds before Tommy asked me for my drink. I snapped out of it, ""What's that?"".

""Your drink, Mac. What would you like to drink?"" he said, gesturing in a chugging motion.

""Oh, um, just grab me a shot of the usual, please.""

With that, he made his way to the far end cooler. Blackberry brandy, a local delicacy. Never had it before I moved down here, but it quickly became my drink of choice. If your local watering hole doesn't keep a bottle or two in their frostiest cooler, don't bother. A warm shot of this might as well be a felony.

Tommy poured a heavy hand into the glass in front me, ""It's on me, buddy."" He poured another for himself and we clinked our glasses. 

""You alright, man? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

That nauseous rot in my stomach returned. The hum of the lights above me seemed to grow louder in sync with my thudding heart. How would I even have begun to explain what I had just seen? Before I could formulate a lie, he had to greet a new bar patron. My eyes followed suit to find that it was a familiar face. There she was, the girl I had just seen at Vincent's.

""Do you come here often?"" she said with a faux twang accent, pulling up in the vacated seat next to me. 

""I-uh... reckon."" I said coyly, channeling my inner John Wayne.

""Looks like we have the place all to ourselves,"" she remarked with a grin.

""Tommy better not leave the register unattended, there must be a whole 50$ in there."" I quipped. 

She laughed. ""Perfect, just the right amount to start a new life with.""

She presented her mixed drink to me for a cheers, only for me to realize my shot was empty. Suddenly, as if telepathically summoned, Tommy was there pouring into my glass mid air. Talk about top notch service.

 ""Here's to..."" I trailed off.

""Here's to another summer in the books,"" she declared.

I nodded my head and followed through with my second dose of medicine.

She then continued, ""So are you local year round?""

I shook my head yes and clarified, ""Haven't always been. This is going to be the second winter I stay down here. How about you?""

She then proceeded to explain that she was back in school, her father owned Vincent's and she was only helping on weekends until they closed for the year. She was a nursing major, in the thick of her training to become certified. I listened intently; she seemed like she had a plan. I discovered we were the same age, 23, yet on completely different avenues in life. She was at least on a road, I haven't been on one for miles.

""Enough about me, what are you up to?"" A question I was dreading. I answered very plainly, ""I don't know.""

After a brief silence, I involuntarily laughed. ""I'm just trying to figure somethings out. It's been a very long couple of years.""

I think she could see the fatigue on my face. ""Do you want to talk about it?""

I shook it off. ""Not particularly, it'll pass. Just a matter of time.""

I noticed she must have gone home and changed, she was no longer in her generic east coast Italian pizzeria shirt. She was wearing a faded Rolling Stones shirt under her plaid long sleeve. I saw my opening and quickly changed the subject.

""Hey, I love that shirt. I work over at Spectre's, actually. We have one just like it.""

She looked down and declared. ""That's hilarious, that's where I stole this from!""

We both laughed.

""It wouldn't surprise me,"" I remarked. ""The staff there is terrible, someone needs to be fired.""

Our laughter echoed in the empty bar, only now mixing with the sound of a different song — ""These Eyes"" by The Guess Who. The ghosts never miss. 

She continued, ""The Stones are my dad's favorite band. He named me Angie after the song."" 

I liked that, it fit her.

""My dad loved them too,"" I concurred. ""He took me to see them when I was a kid.""

She smiled. ""Sounds like a great dad to me.""

I averted my gaze and wanted to change the subject. Then it hit me — maybe she'd like the album I took home. I began to reach for my bag only to find that it was missing something; the record.

My eyes went into the distance, suddenly being brought back to the reality that was my night.

""Everything okay?"" she inquired.

""Yeah, I just took an album home tonight and I think I might have left it behind.""

Then a thought chilled me to the bone. Did it fall out of my bag when I fell on the boardwalk? It was a white album, I would've seen it, right? Unless... did it slip between the cracks? My mind raced for a moment before she said, ""Looks like I'm not the only person on the island with the 5-finger discount at Spectre's.""

I snapped out of it and gave a half-hearted chuckle. I looked at my phone — few missed calls, few texts I didn't care to answer. It was getting close to 11; I had definitely stayed longer than my allotted time at Mick's. Besides, I had a girl at home that didn't like to be kept waiting — Daisy, my German shepherd. She was no doubt worried sick where I was.

The thoughts of what I had seen earlier that night began storming upon what was a good mood. I quickly said, ""I have to get going, my dog is home waiting for me and she could probably use a quick walk before bed.""

Angie smiled wide. ""I love dogs! Do you think I could meet her?""

There was a pause. I didn't know if she meant this very moment or in the near future. Either option didn't feel good to me. It was a nice surprise to meet someone who could distract me from my mind this long. What was the endgame here? This girl was probably better off just leaving whatever this was between us right here at Mick's.

""I'm sure you'll see her. I walk her a lot around here, maybe if she's good I'll grab a slice for her this weekend.""

That was the best I could do. It was better than ""Run as fast as you can.""

""Do you need me to walk you home?""

She responded, ""I'm meeting some of my friends at The Pointe, I was going to call an Uber. It's their last weekend of work here, so they want to celebrate.""

Tommy, beginning to close up for the night, spoke up. ""I can wait here with her, I'm still cleaning up. I'll see you tomorrow night.""

With what I was going to do next on my mind, I began to make my way to exit. Just as I was opening the doors, she shouted, ""You never told me your name!""

Without turning around, or even thinking, I responded, ""It doesn't really matter.""

What the hell did I mean by that?

Just as I opened the bar doors, I was greeted by a misty air. The air had taken a new quality — this one was thick. Given the frequent temperature fluctuations this time of year, it was no surprise that a storm was on the way.

I looked down the corridor of street lights that resided on Atlantic Ave. Blinking yellow lights — an offseason signature — and the only illuminating sight on this foggy night. There was a slight rumble in the sky.

As I made my way, my footsteps on the sidewalk echoed into eternity. Each step making me less sure of what I was doing. I made it to the foot of the slope, my shadow growing larger with each step. I peered out to the loose board I had become acquainted with. The fog had passed just long enough for me to see that there was nothing there — just bare naked concrete.

I had felt like a child, frightfully staring down a dark hallway after hearing a bump in the night. I scanned the area — no sight of the album. It was around this time that I noticed it was a full moon. With a storm approaching, that combination would definitely spell for a high tide. If the record was down there, it would be gone by morning. I turned my phone flashlight on and was greeted with more impenetrable fog.

By this point, I could feel the kiss of rain above me. The boom of thunder alerted me to make a decision. I took steps forward into the mouth of the boardwalk, searching the sandy floor — nothing. I turned my attention to the concrete wall; this had to be the spot. 

No sooner had I turned my attention there, a creaking crawl of sound rang out. Was someone above me? I shined my phone upward and saw nothing but the brilliance of the full moon between the cracks.

I took a deep breath and noticed something peeking through the sand to my left. In a shallow grave created by the wind and sand was a white square. I immediately grabbed it. Secret Treaties. Finally, I can get the hell out of here.

I inspected the LP for damage from the fall to find it was relatively unbothered, except for one thing. As I searched for my coffee stain, I was met with a surprise. The faint brown stain was overlapped by a new color.

Black?

There was a jet black streak smeared across the plastic sleeve. To my eyes, It was crusted and coarse, like concrete. I held it close to my flashlight, unable to decipher its meaning.

Just then, another creak. I frantically shun my light in both directions to find the origin. Nothing.

Something did catch my eye — the wall. The clear fluid I had noticed in my early encounter had created a slimy drip down the wall. It led to a burrowing path into the sand. It was as if something had crept in an effort to be undetected. The trail appeared to be thick and deliberate.

Using my light, I traced the journey of the fluid to find it created a path to where I found the album. It led even further. I took slight steps to discover more.

I couldn't stop; my mind was screaming at me to turn back, but my inquisitive feet prevailed. I must have hypnotically walked an entire two blocks investigating when I was stopped dead in my tracks.

I spotted the edge of a sharp corner sticking out of the sand. I knelt down to investigate — it was a photo. I lifted it high and shook the sand. I knew this picture. It was the snapshot of a father with his newly born daughter in his arms.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1oo62r4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Solotravelindia/comments/1oo62r4/my_story/,My story,"so here is my story…
throwback to when I was 17 studying in Chandigarh coming from an conservative family 

a little tee on me :- mostly grew alone lost mom early and dad being haryanvi strict yk the drills
I wasn’t the best of either worlds neither in studies nor in love but held big dreams of achieving both
and then this person came in my life very calm shy studios with similar crazy ambitions like mine and we immediately connected as if it was God send although he was from Rajasthan but kept on visting Haryana as his mom was posted here
never in my life I have shared so much to someone idk why i did but maybe I feel connected he came from similar family past raised by his mom(I’m not complaining, but this made me feel like he would understand me more and he did)

Now comes to rock bottom 
We kept on talking for months but eventually my past trauma got better of me and I started to lose feeling for him idk what was going on with me at that point as if devil got inside me and I started to talk with others
He was fuming got angry felt cheated and I thought this is the end of story which I’ll regret forever
But here comes the God‘s plan! I felt just like other people  he would go away after being so hurt
But he forgived me(he didn’t need to but he did) and stood with me as a rock as if all of this events didn’t even bother to that person. Doesn’t matter how much I tried to ignore he kept on being there for me specially on the worst nights(where I had crazy fights with my dad because he didn’t let me leave the town) and during exams 
During that time it was too much for me to take so I confess everything to my grandmother and then she uttered this “it’s easy to find love and loving someone is even more easier but someone trying to actually learn you is the toughest to find because you can only express your emotions to someone who try to understand you not someone who just loves” 
That moment something hit my soul that all the time I was wrong about my concept of love maybe because I was not raised by my mom but I started to see the world from different perspective and I realise that the entire time I was in love with him(even if little) but I misplaced it with feelings and then suddenly it triggered that guy actually healed me maybe just by understanding me which no one else ever try to did (and no one will do because who cares about others ik but he did)

Now Back to real life 
Still living with the guilt so was not able to talk to him openly but he stood as if he didn’t care and gave me time
I won’t lie I did felt that there are so many girls out there so wtf he is still talking with me after all this is he crazy and not bragging but even I had the greed that I can’t let go of such person from my life

And then came in the life turning moment
I was supposed to travel solo to Mumbai in couple of months because my cousin bro is getting married (although my father didn’t allow me to go but I somehow convinced him)
I just told him once weeks prior that I am going to Mumbai and then comes the biggest twist in my life!!
He said that even he is going to Mumbai the same week with his mom for her mom’s corporate work

I cried that night went to God and asked her how this is happening in my wildest imagination I never would have thought

Fast forward to flight day- 
I landed in Mumbai and the air felt different as if I am going there to rewrite my stories
He and his mom landed three days later
atp I had no idea how I’ll convince my cousins or how he will convince his mom to go out so I left everything up to God if God is able to take us this far then she will surely give us a solution

Fast forward to few days later 
I am sitting with him in Marine Drive sipping a coffee as if every crazy thing worked out
At that very night I chose him and never to look back
And touchwood this is the best decision I ever made in my life he made me a woman I always wanted to become. 
Since then everything worked out in my life as if he was bringing that God’s energy later helped me to get my dream college and the most surprising thing he ended up gaining the confidence of my father idk how
Later we did travelling together to even more places and we’ve planned abroad which is happening soon.

now back current time
After five years of relationship, now we have called it official and will be getting married soon💍

Made me realise that God is real and actually does send you the right person at the right time maybe I was too fool to realise it, but at the same time I’m grateful that he didn’t took me long to realise this fact considering I was just a child at that age
Even now when someone ask me why do you love him?
I say them openly  he understands me which no one else did and it keeps everyone shut their mouth because who’s gonna find someone like that

Hope my story was inspiring for others…

Here are some questions I have this morning for those who are convinced this isn’t natural.

1) If it has live beings onboard it likely isn’t travelling nearly as fast as it would need to come from another star system.  How do you explain this?

2) If the craft travelled much faster to get here or was sent to study our system, why is there no evidence of it slowing, as we would expect to see?

3) If you are going to say that maybe it already slowed, the why is it still going far too fast for any meaningful exploration (and not slowing down)?

4) Why would they send a ship disguised as a comet (which we can easily see) rather than just being a ship (much harder to see)?  

5) If you believe that earth has been visited before, how does a “hey look at us” approach make any sense?  Why are they seemingly both wanting us to see them and not wanting us to see them (the “disguised as a comet idea”)?

6) Why would a ship be out gassing huge volumes of valuable resources when they are in space where such resources are not readily available and easily replaceable ?  

7) If they were coming to earth, why didn’t they come to earth instead of an indirect approach behind the sun that won’t really bring them close to the planet, and that allowed for us to to observe the entire maneuver?

8) Anyone capable of interstellar travel would have to know, well before arriving here, that our planet exists, and that it looks like it would support life . Why would they not come close for look?  Whether searching for resource or life, they would know we have both.

I’m a 44-year-old active guy currently on the injury bench (10/10 would not recommend). Since I’ve got more free time than I know what to do with, I thought I’d throw myself into the internet and see if anyone’s keen to chat, share injury stories or tell me about the best coffee spot. 

I’ll be off my feet for a while the dogs giving me funny looks, and before I become one with the couch I’ll see if I can meet (maybe not right now) some humans. 

My hobbies include running, staring dramatically out the window and guessing how many time my neighbour will open and close his windows. 


If you’re up for a chat (or recommend binge worthy Netflix/podcast), making a new mate, or hanging out once I’m mobile again, however slow that may be 😀 hit me up or DM me. ",3,1762260148.0,BrisbaneSocial,3,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Our first date wasn’t at a café—it was at a clinic. She was sick, I took her there, we shared idlis after, and somehow, love began between meds and laughter.","The First Date Was at the Clinic

She worked in the same office, just a few desks away, but for a whole year, I couldn’t gather the courage to speak to her. Every time she walked past, my heart would race. Her wheatish complexion, calm eyes, and that soft smile—she had this quiet grace that could stop time. I’d catch just two glimpses of her each day, and somehow, that was enough to make my entire day feel brighter.

I tried—many times—to strike up a conversation, but shyness always won. What if she ignored me? Or worse, made fun of me? So, I stayed silent, admiring her from a distance. Until one day, on my birthday, I took a chance. I invited her to the small celebration we were having at the office.

To my surprise, she said yes.

That evening, when she walked in wearing a blue top and black jeans, I froze. She looked breathtaking—simple, but unforgettable. For the first time, I felt like the world had slowed down just for me. We laughed, we spoke casually, and somehow, that night broke the wall I had built between courage and fear.

Days turned into weeks, and our chats became part of my routine. Then one day, I got a call from one of her colleagues—her blood count had dropped, and she wasn’t feeling well. Without a thought, I rushed back from my field visit, straight to the office. She looked pale, weak, but still managed a faint smile when I told her I’d take her to the doctor.

It wasn’t a date. Not the kind people plan with candles and flowers. But for me, it was the most real, most intimate first date imaginable. I remember the way she held onto my shoulder as we rode through the city on my bike, the wind in her hair, her silence saying more than words could.

At the clinic, I waited outside while she went through the tests, feeling restless, protective, and strangely… complete. When the doctor handed me the prescriptions, I bought the medicines right away. As we stepped out, she turned to me and said softly, “I’m hungry.”

We ended up at a small café nearby—plain walls, steel plates, and the smell of filter coffee in the air. We ordered an idli plate, a medu vada, and a glass of fruit pulp. Nothing fancy, but somehow, it became our meal. We laughed over silly things, shared food from the same plate like we’d known each other forever. There was an ease, a warmth that felt like home.

When I dropped her home that evening, the sky was turning gold. She waved goodbye, and I remember thinking—if this is how our story begins, I wouldn’t want it any other way.

The next morning, I took her for her follow-up check-up, and from then on, we just… kept talking.

Years have passed, but that first date—our clinic date—remains etched in my heart. No restaurant, no candlelight, no fancy music could ever compare to the sound of her laughter in that café, the way her eyes lit up over a plate of idlis, or how fate chose such an ordinary day to give me something so extraordinary.

- **Pre-Opening & G&A Costs:** Pre-opening expenses rose 59.7% in Q3 2025 to $3.8 million; G&A increased 21.9% to $33.7 million.

**Cash Flow & Capital Expenditures:**
- **Operating Cash Flow:** $107.5 million year-to-date, up from $92.7 million.
- **Investing:** $120.1 million spent on capital expenditures, $54.8 million on acquisitions in 39 weeks.
- **CapEx Guidance:** Estimated $150.0 million in 2025 (excluding potential for future deals).

**Risks & Concerns:**
- **Profitability Pressure:** Net income margin remains low at 0.9% in Q3 and 0.5% YTD, reflecting cost pressures, higher depreciation/amortization, and G&A.
- **High Effective Tax Rate:** Q3 2025 effective tax rate of 47.3% (up from 39.6%); YTD rate at 44.7%.
- **Rising Interest Expense:** Q3 interest expense increased 32.7% to $4.6 million.
- **Commodity and Labor Costs:** Elevated and projected higher for the coming year.
- **Debt Load:** Increased borrowings to support expansion and acquisitions.

**Control Environment:**
- Material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting remain unresolved but remediation actions are in progress, including new leadership hires and process improvements.

**Legal and Regulatory:**
- The company faces routine legal proceedings but asserts none are expected to have a material adverse effect.

**Share Details:**
- 61,032,105 shares outstanding as of October 31, 2025.
- Insider trading plans disclosed: Chief Development Officer (up to 75,000 shares) and a director (up to 98,650 shares) established Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements in Q3.

**Investor Takeaways:**
- First Watch demonstrated strong topline growth, robust new unit development, and improved operating margins in the quarter. However, net profit margin remains slim due to increased G&A, depreciation, interest costs, and a higher tax rate. The company continues to invest heavily in growth, both organically and via acquisitions, resulting in higher leverage. Investors should monitor the ongoing inflationary headwinds, progress on internal control remediation, and the impact of debt service on future profitability.

Said he was “going to have a nervous breakdown.” I feel terrible for playing therapist and catering to him but I didn’t want my kids to be affected. 

I have a big exam today that I need in order to apply for my graduate program and suddenly he is kissing me on the forehead, saying he doesn’t want the marriage to impact my studies. He is making me coffee, smiling smugly, and patting himself on the back for picking up pizza last night. It occurred to me that he wasted my time with emotional turmoil to impact my studies and when there was no time left, he flipped a switch to be the “supportive spouse.” He does not want me to get into this program.

The Tsla’o drone arrived the next day. It was of the nature-shapes school of design, looking rather like a large, angular metal seed. It had two ion impellers sitting as far outboard as it could, stubby winglets, a gravitic motor tucked away somewhere, and what was the most compact waverider drive Alex had ever seen. The array - the part where gravity met spacetime - was barely longer than his hand, which... well, it would go, but not very fast. Not compared to a Scoutship, or even the Corvin when upgraded.

Given the space limitations *inside* the Artifact, that was for the best.

Carbon insisted on giving it and all the parts that came with it a thorough once over before putting it into service. Given that someone had tried sneaking stuff in already, no one was taking chances.

Alex, meanwhile, had gotten the go ahead to take the *Hokule’a* out on its maiden flight, a shakedown run to ensure that it was all the way put back together and ready to be sent into the void deeper in the Artifact’s core. Just take it up, give the systems a once over, bring it back.

Williams had invited herself along, as she had some experience with military aircraft and having a copilot sitting in the second seat felt wise, extra eyes and hands wouldn’t hurt while they were checking things out.

She also taught Alex that the padding could be taken off the seats so an environment suit can be worn without stacking eight or ten centimeters of suit on top of ten centimeters of conformal gel. It was nice to be able to be comfortable *with* the extra security the suit provided without feeling like he was sitting in a chair the Tsla’o would find comically small.

This wasn’t something he had needed to know until now. Alex had never been issued an e-suit before, and the Scoutship program had the view that if you needed to wear a suit and pilot the spacecraft at the same time, shit was going very badly so long term comfort was not a concern.

“All right. The exterior preflight checklist is all green.” Alex said as he stepped up into the Corvin again, tablet in hand. Williams was sitting in the first officer’s seat, still backed away from the controls and drinking coffee. Technically he didn’t need to do the preflights due to onboard system checks being enough for most instances, but a maiden flight didn’t feel like the time to find out something got missed.

“Good. Feel free to take your time with the interior check.” Williams also had a danish. The small dispenser in the smaller kitchenette in the back of the Corvin was freshly calibrated and she had offered to test it when she arrived as Alex was inspecting the hydrogen intake. 

It looked to Alex like the first time she had just sat somewhere without actively doing work since they had arrived almost two weeks ago. He didn’t recall ever seeing her without at least a comm in hand, if not a larger device, working on something. It got set aside while she was eating, usually, but that was not exactly a lot of down time.

Carbon hadn’t mentioned it as a point of concern to him, though, and those two had been working together consistently so she would have noticed if Williams was getting overworked. Probably. Carbon’s idea of overworked involved an alarming amount of work, but she would certainly recognize burnout.

In others, at least.

He didn’t mind, though. She could take half an hour off, it was probably good for her. Trying to do a checklist with two people when one wasn’t an instructor just felt like it’d be more trouble than whatever time it might have saved was worth.

The physical inspection was actually quick, and he had the door buttoned up and was running through the software and controls - and making Williams do the check on the first officer’s side of the cockpit while he tossed her trash in the recycler, since she was sitting over there anyway.

”All right, all right.” Alex mumbled to himself as he attached the *Hokule’a* to the local Air Traffic Control network - the only ATC in the Artifact, as far as they were aware. “Drones are well clear of here, nothing else in the air for ten clicks all the way to the barrier. Would you notify the ground crew that we’re gonna be opening the doors?”

“I certainly can.” Williams used her individual comm for that, giving Carbon, Zheng, and Amalu a heads up that it was about to get real cold for a few minutes.

Those three were giving the Tsal’o drone a deep imaging with the scanning equipment. Kavo was working on the controller that it came with, which looked more like a laptop than anything else, ensuring nothing had been installed in that surreptitiously.

They all trusted each other, but somebody out there was clearly trying to send someone in here things in secret, probably to manufacture weapons. That wasn’t looked very kindly upon by anybody, even if one or more of them were just pretending to not like it. It wasn’t even clear why they wanted to do that. Just to take control of the operation? What was the plan when it was time to head back out through a portal that dropped them at the doorstep of the seat of Human power?

Or did someone actually think that the people who built a wee little Dyson sphere could be cowed with some Human made weapons? It was hard to find a use case for that didn’t involve massive hubris.

He figured that if there was the concern that weapons might be needed should something more dangerous than Rakaro appear, so we’re gonna sneak the parts in just in case, someone would just say that out loud after they got found out. Probably wouldn’t have set up a secret bypass on his shuttle.

Alex cleared his throat, cleared his mind, and checked the exterior cameras. Everyone was well clear of the hangar doors, so he sent the command to open them. It took two minutes. 

Just sitting there. 


Waiting.

The light on the doors turned green. Alex fired up the gravitics and eased the shuttle out of the building, the ATC system giving him permission to fly the plan he had submitted that morning. It was just a lazy loop around their geofenced area with several altitude changes and a few maneuvers that bordered on acrobatic. Once clear of the building and a few hundred meters up, he switched to thrusters and eased the throttle up, bringing them to a respectable 900 kph as he continued to ascend.

So far, everything is behaving as expected. Alex banks it gently to starboard, not really pushing the craft yet as they begin the loop. No alarms, nothing fell off. Not even so much as an unusual vibration in the frame.

“Everything look good on your side?” He inquired. They should be seeing the same data. This was the one thing he had an abundance of caution on.

“Yeah. Nothing outside of the expected ranges so far.” Williams clicked through the diagnostics screens that Alex wasn’t paying attention to at the moment. “Reactor is running a little lean, but still within spec.”

“I’m not feeling any lag on the motors and the power distribution system isn’t complaining. If it’s not causing any issues, I think that’ll be fine.” Alex was paying more attention to actually flying the thing. He could have fed the flight plan into the onboard systems and let them fly it, but he preferred to actually maintain control of the shuttle himself. “Actually, let’s test that out.”

It was time for the first elevation change, almost all the way up to the barrier. He pulled the stick back and pushed the throttle up all the way, a much steeper and faster climb than he had originally intended. The onboard systems complained about that deviation, and the ATC sent a warning notification, but not a peep about the shift in power consumption.

Williams did give him a healthy amount of side eye as well.

“Kinetic buffers were keeping up with that, felt like. As long as we’re not getting too dependent on the shield systems, I don’t foresee it being an issue.” Alex paused here, glancing over the instruments. “I hope you’ll forgive me for not impact testing the shields.”

“That’s fine, I’ll survive.” Her reply was a bit sardonic. “Hey, Sorenson. You’ve been working with Lan Tshalen for some time now, correct?”

“Yeah. A little over a year, I think.” In theory, they were still supposed to be jetting around the Orion arm in the *Kshlav’o*, out closer to Tsla’o space. Best laid plans, and all that. “Haven’t been keeping track of the exact dates, but around there.”

She nodded. “That’s quite a long time to be working directly with a Tsla’o, in my experience.” 

“That’s what I’ve heard.” He was doing his best to not to look suspicious about where this conversation was going. When he glanced over, Williams appeared focused on the primary flight display in front of her, keeping track of the plethora of sensor data streaming across it. “You and Sergeant Zenshen go back a ways, don’t you?”

“Yeah, but we haven’t been working together the entire time. Kind of a military thing, you go where you’re told... and yes, I know you’re working for the Navy, but you’re not in the Navy.” She had her hand on the control stick on her side of the cockpit, using the hat switch to flip through the diagnostics pages. “Did meet up from time to time, we both got pressed into the role of handling the other race after the general success of the rescue operation on Zeshela.”

Alex laughed. “I’ve heard the story a couple of times now, Zenshen has the retelling of it down to an art. Not something I’d want to have to deal with, though. Perfectly fine just hearing about it.”

“Yeah, tkt drops are always bad. Wild how often people think that they can put an outpost or settlement down near a hive and not expect problems.” Williams was visibly annoyed by that. “At least some of them do it because they’re trying to study the bugs, not just attempting to compete with them for resources.”

“Is that... Is that a common problem?” Seriously, how often could something like that happen? Alex banked the shuttle again, preparing for another elevation change - though this one would be nice and gentle.

She exhaled a single sarcastic laugh. “All the damn time on the frontier. tkt hives end up on a lot of semi-habitable planets and they do a lot of mining but not a lot of building - I think some people get the impression that they can be stolen from for ‘free’ goods. Which, to be fair, they can be if you’re careful.”

“And they’re not careful?”

“Damned if I know.” A brief lift of her shoulders. “The folks in charge of those decisions were either the first to die or had managed to hide somewhere while their operation got shredded by bugs and were prepared to take their culpability to the grave.”

“Fuck’s sake.” What else could you say to that? He eased the stick forward, filling the silence after that statement with action. “Beginning descent.”

“That’s the usual reaction to that information.” She said, eyes glued to the altitude indicator as the meters melted off it. “I got off topic there. I meant to ask you if you knew the Lan is related to the Tsla’o Empress?”

That's a bit of a question there, isn't it, Alex?

I don't remember why I stylized tkt as their name, but I did. Now I'm sticking to it. For those who haven't read [Rock and a Hard Place](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/12xu7rl/bridgebuilder_side_stories_1/), or not read it recently, they're one of the four known races. They are somewhat bug-like and generally unconcerned with other races - so much so the worker caste are often perceived as docile. Provocations such as killing or obvious large scale theft from the hive will be met with violent reprisals. They are hive-minded and everything about them points to there having been higher castes that have died out, leaving the lower castes to toil endlessly to unearth materials for a system that no longer exists.

* What’s the most helpful way for a new platform to introduce itself to the restaurant community?
* Are there channels, groups, or methods you’ve seen that build trust and spark interest—without feeling like spam or unwanted promotion?
* Any tips to avoid common mistakes or pitfalls when connecting with restaurant owners?

All feedback is welcome—major challenges, success stories, and what you’d want to see (or NOT see!) from a new platform.

I’ll admit I’m a bit awkward when it comes to chatting,so there’s that,but I’d really just like to have someone to message now and then. Could be about the day, something deep,random nonsense,absolutely whatever.

Breakfast:
Denver Central Market in RiNo has a few nice options.
Migas Coffee, also in RiNo, has the best coffee I've ever had and they're great people. 
LoDough in Dairy Block has a Cubano croissant that slaps. 
Sam's No. 3 is iconic to people here, but it's not my jam. 

Lunch:
Avanti, Milepost Zero and Milk Market are all food halls, so is DCM above, kinda like the Wharf place in Tampa. 

Pregame:
Anywhere in Larimer Square is cool, beautiful to walk through. 
Rhein Haus, Celtic or Society Sports are gonna be packed with fans but a lotta fun and good energy. 
There's a Mic Ultra bar outside, but still inside Ball, if that makes any sense? I walk to games so I just hammer a few beers before I leave my place. 

Postgame:
It's Tuesday take your ass to sleep. 

Activities:
The tour at Coors Field is awesome, totally recommend. 
16th Street just fully reopened and is kinda cool, I walk it a ton and love it. 
We have tiger cubs at the Denver Zoo. 
The Aquarium also has tigers. 
If you have a car and want a little mountain experience, Clear Creek Canyon is super close and a good experience. 
My wife really likes the Denver Art Museum if that's your thing. It's not mine but to each their own. 
Get day drunk at Bierstad LagerHaus, Westbound & Down, Tap Fourteen or Schoolyard. 
Walk around RiNo area and check out the local stores and the artwork on basically every building 

Overall, Denver is awesome and have fun. Stay hydrated, if you're seeing this and just got off a plane from somewhere flat, do NOT push your luck today. Altitude Sickness is no joke. The city is insanely walkable and people are incredibly friendly though. 

Oh, if you're staying downtown and flying in and out ... Take the A-Line from Union to DIA and vice versa. Can't say this enough. The ride share apps to DIA, which is basically like ... Amalie to Tropicana are not worth what you will spend on them. 

You can also park at the 38th and Blake Street RTD station and take the A-Line if you rented a car and hate paying for parking like I do. 

If you plan on partaking in the marijuanas, again, stay hydrated and don't overdo it. Just because the edible doesn't thump right away, it will. ",19,1762258508.0,TampaBayLightning,5,1.0,False
1oo5r34,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobhunting/comments/1oo5r34/5_reasons_your_personal_brand_matters_more_for/,5 reasons your personal brand matters more for your career than you think,"I used to think personal branding was just for founders and freelancers. Then I started to work on personal branding for employees and job seekers and realised that it's one of the most underrated career accelerators out there.

It’s about shaping how people see your work, your potential, and your next move. It can help you solve everyday problems ambitious professionals face:

1. Visibility = career currency: Your public professional profile becomes measurable career capital. Visible achievements and ideas make you a go-to person, not just another CV in the pile. When you are applying for a role, people will check out your profile, and they will already have a picture of you, it's like a foot in the door.
2. Long-lasting network connections: You can accelerate your connections and networking to ones that actually last. Thoughtful posts and shared ideas keep your contacts engaged, so opportunities live longer than a single coffee chat or event.
3. You can be the obvious hire: When new roles or projects open, managers think of people they already know and trust. A clear personal brand puts you on that shortlist, even for stretch roles.
4. Give you better leverage for raises & projects: A strong reputation shifts the conversation from “why you?” to “how can we move faster with you?” It’s easier to ask for a raise, lead bigger projects, or negotiate flexibility when your impact is visible and credible. (Because we all know that, unfortunately, what you can do doesn't matter if they ""don't see it""...)
5. Resilience = career safety net: Even if you lose a job or switch industries, your reputation travels with you. Your online presence keeps doors open, because people already know what you stand for.

Of course, knowing this doesn’t make it easy...

**Before surgery**

I was having TONS of symptoms. Yellowish stool (fat exiting instantly), stomach pain, zero tolerance of fatty foods, sent me immediately to the toilet (which baffles me when people complain about this post op since it was one of my main symptoms before) and other symptoms like bloating, fatigue, weight loss ect... Long story short, went to my family Dr. got tests and everything came back perfect, went to my GI doctor and got endoscopy and sigmoidoscopy and both came back clean (endoscopy with a little burn from reflux but omeprazole solved it). Then I had an attack, worst pain ever, went to ER and CT scan showed nothing, got sent home with pain meds. I went to a new Dr. and he sent me to get an ultrasound first thing and voilá: a huge stone over 2cm in my gallbladder. He told me those take years to form so the symptoms thought the last months/year fit the criteria. Got sent to a surgeon and got surgery on the last Tuesday.

**Straight After Surgery**

First days are rough like any surgery. Pain, confusion, fatigue ect....but I kept chugging a hydration drinks and went to sleep as much as possible since it was borderline impossible to have a good sleep. Ate soup and yogurt only.  

*Day 2* after surgery I woke up a little better with discomfort instead of pain, wounds way better and with hunger. Had egg whites, crackers, chicken breast, white rice (bland foods) because of the recommendations and the day went well. **I do** recommend **Miralax every morning so the stool slides instead of having to push it out.** 

*Day 3* I woke up after sleeping around 10 hours straight at last. Feel a lot better, no pain only minimal discomfort since I'm healing and ate panda express ( noodles and teriyaki chicken throwing out the excessive fat). I can sit and stand way easier, burping doesn't feel as uncomfortable and went to the toilet without a problem. Will keep a ""safe"" diet during the first week since I'm very anxious about my tummy (because of all the months with problems) but I'm glad to say it went well apparently 

Days 4-5 Pretty much the same, getting better and introducing fat slightly just to test out my stomach. Ate cream cheese, scrambled eggs, air fried fries ect..all good. Only needed to run to the toilet after one meal a day so it's a win for me since before I went after every meal. 

Days 6-7 This is when I noticed the most improvement. Decided to eat a whole breakfast each day with toast and butter, milk in coffee, scrambled eggs. Meals are pretty much normal (rice and beans with chicken breast and stuff like that nothing fried or excessively greasy). These two days I didn't get the urge to go to the bathroom and te the most fat! Everything went down nicely and I'm feeling better each day in terms of discomfort and pain.

**Only bad/debilitating pain I still feel is a sort of spasm type of pain I get sometimes after eating of laying down too much time between the right rib and the hip bone** but read here and was told by Dr. it's normal after a surgery since things are still healing. It lasts for like 15 minutes and I get instant relief if I lay down in an incline position. It has happened once a day or twice at most. Since I've been pretty much painless overall after day 3 I don't mind it that much.  

Hope my personal story and situation helps balance the hope scale here and thanks to everyone who wrote here for the tips and motivation!
