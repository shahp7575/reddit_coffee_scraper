My boyfriend (we are both 18) is my first relationship so I don't really have a basis of what a relationship is supposed to feel like which is why I don't know whether I'm in the wrong. He is great at saying the right thing and always tries to be romantic and says I love you and is amazing in that way but it feels like sometimes he is all talking and no doing. It feels like if it requires any effort, he won't do it! For example, I have paid for every single: train ticket (even if it's his to come see me or his to come home and I'm not with him) bus ticket, meal for either of us, day out, date, drinks EVERYTHING! He's never taken me on a date that he has paid for, our first ""date"" was just watching a film at his house. I even paid most of my birthday dinner that he ""took me out for"".  I would just like to be treated one day yk? He says he has no money (even borrowing from me sometimes, he has yet to pay back) but then buys random stuff that he doesn't need like military gear when he is not in the military and never will be (due to health) nor does he play Airsoft or anything! He just likes collecting the same thing over and over, it which is fine if you have a disposable income. I don't want to stop his hobbies but one day, I'd just like him to think of me instead of buying another set of webbing etc when I sacrifice all of my ""fun"" money (not food money or rent) to see and treat him. Note that he also does not have to pay food or rent because he lives with his parents I don't. There's other things like prioritising a lot of things that I see as unnecessary over me such as playing 7+h on the PS4 whilst I'm there at his house, leaving me to just sit on his bed bored and he gets annoyed if i go on my phone whilst he's playing his games because im not ""paying attention"". I get he's just decompressing, that's good, but 7+h ( from waking up till me leaving) is a bit silly. I see other girls being taken out, even for a walk or a coffee, by their bfs and I just feel jealous because all we ever do is sit in bed and marinate. It's gross, I can't sit in bed all day, it drives be coocoo! I've spoken to him about this but it's still all we do at his house. He doesn't have work as an excuse because he hasn't got a job and won't get one because he doesn't want it to ""mess with his free time"" and his college course is piss easy and requires no learning/ no exams. 

I feel horrible for feeling unhappy because when he is being nice, he's lovely and seems genuinely madly in love with me but I feel like I'm just falling out of love because of his immaturity. I feel like I give so much and shouldn't be wanting for more but I am. Am I just greedy? I don't know. AiTA?? ",3,1730556066.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

So I (19M) have recently moved cities to go to college and, naturally, I've met a lot of new people including this one girl (19F)

She immediately stood out and long story short, after some classes, I got to talk to her for a couple of hours. 

She was really one of a kind and I thought we really had so much in common. We've texted eachother until we began going on proper dates. Things happened really fast. If monday we first went for a coffee, thursday was the first kiss, and friday the first ""proper date"" as a ""couple"" of some sorts. 

I've asked her if we are a couple and she said she likes me much, but would like to get to know me more (nothing intimate had happened yet). At first she was no dry texter, we would text till 2 am and go to sleep. She never told me good night or things like that. 

After two weeks (in which we almost saw eachother two times a day) my roommate went home and so I had the room all to myself. I've asked her to come for the night. She told me that she hadn't had (until me) a partner for 2 years. No kisses, no itimacy, not even proper dates for 2 years. 

The thing is, I've grown up without a father and I'm pretty sure I have 'father syndrome'. I put my heart on the table really fast, I need validation that she likes me. I need her to text me as often as she can. That's how I express my love, and that's how I expect someone that likes me to treat me back. I know it's wrong, but I simply can't help it. I've fought this trait of mine for so long now. 

After that night she stopped texting as often, she seemed less excited to see me, started making other plans instead of dates. 

I can understand that for a week I've been with her 4 hours a day almost everyday, I also feel the need to go out with my friends as well. 

She said she was concerned that I was a player, but now I feel like I got played. 

We are talking for 2 weeks now!! (Since the first proper date, I've changed the time frames for my privacy), which is extremely short. 

She left me on delivered for at least 3 hours multiple times, the texts are dry. We went out on a date to explain things she said that she likes me but wants to take things slower, and that she had a lot of work to do the night before, which really baffles me. When I like a girl I make sure I find windows to talk to her.

We've seen each other only once after that, way less kisses, but still hold our hands. 

But I feel horrible. I don't want her to stay with me just because she is afraid to break up. I can't even be happy anymore because of all the scenarios that I have in my head when she doesn't answer for 4 hours. When we meet (outside of dates) and there are friends around she is awkward and rarely even hugs me. 

I don't know what to think, she doesn't seem to put too much effort in our relationship. Is it because I put too much already?

Is it better if I break up and try to find a girl that can offer me what I search for? Is it even healthy? Wouldn't it be better if I fought for this one to thrive? I really like her and wouldn't want to start searching again. 

I feel like if she gave me too much attention I'd be the one acting like her. What do you think?

Tl;dr : I moved for college and quickly connected with a girl, but after a few weeks, her texts decreased and she seemed less interested. I need a lot of validation due to my upbringing, and I‚Äôm unsure whether to fight for this relationship or let it go for someone who meets my needs better.

This is my first post on reddit and I'm asking for some help. I was passing through the Moynihan Train Hall yesterday with my husband and we briefly visited Vesuvio Bakery before getting on the train and leaving the state (we don't live in NY).

While we were looking around Vesuvio, the bags of coffee they are selling (not their coffee but another company brand name) caught his eye. He loves coffee and loves to buy beans from different roasters. On the way home, he mentioned how he regretted not buying a bag and we couldn't remember the name of the company that makes the coffee beans they are selling right now. That's where I need help...

I tried to call the bakery, but they were not very helpful and quickly became irritated with me. Also, the phone number listed for that location isn't the location in the train station, they said that location doesn't have a phone and that I'd have to visit in person. They also didn't quite understand that I wasn't asking about their coffee beans, I was asking about the bags of beans from another company that they are currently selling.

If someone is in the area, would you be able to visit Vesuvio and get the name of the coffee company they are selling bags of beans of right now? If you're facing the bakery, it is on the left hand side on a few shelves where they would sell hats or other merchandise.

Thank you all so much for your help. I'd love nothing more than to be able to order my husband a bag of this coffee so that he can try it.",1,1730555473.0,Amtrak,2,1.0,False

1ghwtbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/IdleBankTycoon/comments/1ghwtbw/indepth_beginner_guide_helpful_tips/,In-Depth Beginner Guide Helpful Tips,"TL;DR: Review **Bolded** topics to make easy to find and get what you need/want. Ask questions if I missed something and will edit as needed.

Seems like there are a few groups on this sub now. People who maxed it all and have been fading away and new members just getting into the game and having questions. I'm still early/mid game myself but will share what I know in case it can help others (as that is what was missing when I started searching here). Apologies if it gets wordy as I like to provide more detail rather than broad guidance that may not be clear. 

Also, this is focusing on **early** game so I won't even touch on things that go beyond what I think will be learned on your own as you gain the experience and base knowledge needed to understand the graduations that are to come. You DO NOT need this guide to play and have fun; this guide is more directed at those who want to jump in and learn the game dynamics in order to try and be efficient with their gameplay to maximize the effect their choices will have on upgrading their managers/banks/etc.

**First and foremost**, this game is best played when watching a show or doing some other task...I mean it IS an idle game. I say this because of the ad-driven progress the game requires. I find it easiest to turn on Netflix and just casually play. I watch ads, upgrade, etc.

**Managers:** Managers boost your earnings in every part of the bank, so leveling them up is vital. From bank to bank, levels restart for banking items but your managers continue on. 

A great way to invest in and level your managers, especially at the start, is to watch the ads in the store to get rare managers (and sometimes you'll get an epic or legendary in there). The store allows you to watch an ad for a manager every 2 hours but it caps at 5 managers available. This means you can go idle for 10 hours before your manager ads stop accumulating. Take note of this and do your best to keep the 2 hour clock moving if you want to level up managers as quick as you can.

Priority 1 is to have every single manager slot filled. Shortly behind this is to have every slot filled with a manager who has the proper skill/class as that will boost the production.

Epic managers are great as you shift from rare to epic, but legendary are significantly better so it is best to promote and upgrade a legendary, even though it takes more duplicate managers, than it is to keep investing in Epic managers past 3 stars(level 60 max) or so. I did end up with some 4 star/level 80 Epic managers as I needed them to fill slots around bank 3/early bank 4. (Early bank 4 and level 40, I believe, expands to 4 manager slots per area so the initial filling of 20 slots can stretch your manager availability until mid bank 4 or so).

Manager level 40 gives a 50% boost when assigned to a matching specialty slot. Manager level 100 gives a 60% boost when assigned to a matching specialty slot.

Legendary Manager promotion requirements: 2 stars(Level 40 max): requires 4 rare managers. 3 stars: requires 8 rare managers (watch those ads!). 4 stars: requires 2 epic managers. 5 stars: requires 4 epic mangers, 2 of the 4 must be the same specialty as the manager you are upgrading. 1 PURPLE star: 6 epic managers, 4 of 6 must be the same specialty as the manager you are upgrading.

**Manager Briefcase Odds:** Senior Briefcase odds: 88% Rare, 11% Epic, 1% Legendary. Director Briefcase odds: 89% Epic, 11% Legendary. Specialty Briefcase odds: 85% Epic, 15% Legendary (in addition to choosing your desired specialty). Executive Briefcase odds: 82% Epic, 18% Legendary (only get one of the 5 legendary shown, if you get a legendary. you can refresh the options for 20 gold ingots but I do not recommend that).

**Gold Ingots:** You can get 5 gold ingots from the store every 4 hours by watching an ad. I have gotten a bit lazy here when I don't have the time as the manager ads are more important in my opinion. However, watching the ad and collecting and accumulating gold ingots are a great way to fill in manager slots and upgrade managers through buying manager briefcases.

I like to spend my gold ingots on Specialty Briefcases to target and fill in the spots I need or acquire the Epic specialty needed to push my Legendary to 5 stars and beyond. However, don't fret it. If you are missing that one rare manager or any epic manager for the next big promotion, have fun and go for it! Don't kill yourself on the sword of complete discipline if you are close to breaking through whatever wall you are currently at and just need that extra piece.

**Money/Idle Earnings:** The main driver for unlocking bank upgrades, completing business mode, etc. This is pretty self-explanatory but one helpful tip is when coming back to the game after a long night rest: watch the ad and then look to unlock a new feature within your bank with the overnight earnings to help you break through some of the more expensive buy-in areas (whether it is a new marketing desk, service desk, transporter, or vault).

For general gameplay, balancing watching *Instant Reward Ads* as well as collecting *Service Tips* in between is a great way to keep the money flowing and allowing upgrades and/or level purchases in *Business Mode*

**Light Bulbs:** Light bulbs are used solely for upgrading managers. You earn light bulbs in the Business Mode (discussed further below) as well as from event and Bank Quest rewards. Keep completing Business Mode levels until it hurts and digs into your bank earnings where you need to watch multiple *Instant Reward Ads* in order to complete the next Business Mode level. Also, let the Light Bulbs accumulate and get past halfway on the max earning accumulation and then watch and ad to double the earnings and maximize the amount you have for upgrading your managers.

**Bank Upgrades:** Upgrading your bank is important in order to max out the bank and move to the next, which is the entire goal of the game. A few tips here. The **Statistics Page** is your best friend for this. It's a little pie chart looking button on the top right, just by the settings. Try to keep the 3 areas as balanced as you can. Sometimes this may mean shifting managers around or focusing upgrades on the area that needs a boost. When upgrading, look for that next level boost. Even if a Bank Quest requires upgrading to level 138, it's best to go to level 140 (or wherever next upgrade is) and get that extra level boost (you know where the boost is by seeing where the progress bar resets when increasing levels). 

Let Bank Quests guide your upgrading, but not at the cost of the efficiency of your bank. Bank upgrades and Bank Quests overlap significantly so see further info below in the Bank Quests section.

In the end, all bank areas will be 100% upgraded before being able to move on to the next bank, so don't sweat it too much. If you make a mistake on upgrades, just keep playing and having fun, we'll all get there in our own time and way. 

Banks are not intended to be moved through in just an hour or soon, even in a day or two, after you get past the 1st bank so do stress and think you are stuck or doing something wrong. Let the game be what it is intended, a casual fun way to play in your free time where you can be active when you can and idle when you can't.

**Bank Quests:** In order to graduate to the next bank, you must complete all Bank Quests. Balance completing Bank Quests with the needs of your Bank through review of the Statistics page. Balancing your Statistics across the bank areas is a great way at efficiently upgrading and moving through banks. 

Don't upgrade your strongest area just because you have a Bank Quest for it; instead review the 3 available Bank Quests and choose wisely. Review your Statistics Page and do the Bank Quest that relates to the lowest earning area. If you don't have a Bank Quest that is on your lowest earning area, focus on a Bank Quest that doesn't relate to an area, whether it is earning money, light bulbs, collecting Service Tips, increasing total manger levels, or completing Business Mode levels. If that isn't an option, focus on the 2nd lowest earning area and consider shifting managers around to boost up your low area with a stronger manager to try and get back to balance across all areas.

With the above in mind, sometimes you need that one extra piece (whether it be shards or a new briefcase) for that next big manager promotion, so if you have an easy Bank Quest to get to that next reward and it doesn't align with the perfect efficiency of your bank upgrades needed, go for it! Remember that fun is the 1st priority and the rules on how you play are what you decide.

**Instant Reward Ads:** These ads are the meat and potatoes to earning money to upgrade your bank, complete Business Mode levels, etc. The amount these ads offer are directly affected by the production of your 3 main bank areas: Deposits, Service Area, and Vault Room. The lowest earning rate of these 3 areas is what limits your Instant Reward amount offered. Increasing your lowest area will directly increase the Instant Reward amount. This is why it is important to review the Statistic page often and keep balance as best you can (and don't forget, the Vault area amount is always the *lesser* of the two between transporters and the vault so make sure to expand that area and see which one is the lower and upgrade it first when the Vault Area needs a boost)

**Business Mode/Audit Madness:** Defeat Coppersly! Spend $ and earn *Light Bulbs* and other rewards to defeat levels and progress. If you are investing in your managers well, you should have no problem setting the puzzle task to Auto and letting it work it's way through. Auto is the quickest way, typically, to beat the level but the nature of the puzzle always has some RNG luck in terms of how quick it is beat (as you get to harder levels in Business Mode or in Audit Madness events, you may have proper strength of managers and lose once and win the next). Furthermore, Auto Assign of the managers when starting the puzzle game will assign managers in the most efficient way....USE THIS BUTTON. The way auto assign works is it applies the highest score managers, taking the boost for the puzzle level into consideration. For example, the game may assign a manager with 8,000 strength over a manger with 15,000 strength *if* the 8,000 manager gets a boost for that level as it will double to 16,000 and be better than the 15,000.

For Audit Madness, highly recommend doing levels early and often. Don't sandbag because you already did the 5 levels for today's Season Pass event. The Grand Prize is worth it to push as far as you can until failing multiple times so you have time to get there before the event ends (Get those free Executive Briefcases!). When you lose in Audit Madness, you lose a coffee cup but they replenish. When/if you hit a wall you can then focus on manager upgrades for the next level, depending on specialty needed for a boost.

**Decorations:** These boost the deposits area of your bank when upgraded, but the more practical application I have found is these are best to upgrade when they are cheap and you have a *Bank Quest* or Event Quest that requires 300 or so upgrades to meet. Again, everything requires balance, but decorations are rarely something that is worth spending into the area of more expensive upgrades that will directly impact your bank earnings better (like marketing desks, service desks, transporters, and vaults).

**Service Tips:** These are the bags of money you will see in your main hall. Click these to collect money. They are also often Bank Quests as well as event quests, so don't ignore and collect those bags. The more you upgrade your main hall, the more spots these bags can show up and therefore the more that can accumulate at once.",1,1730555226.0,IdleBankTycoon,0,1.0,False

Panic attack, VT, or something else?

Background: 

I‚Äôm a 23 y/o male that has been working out 4-6 days a week for 8 years

I had a regular cup of coffee from home about 1.5-2 hours before going to the gym, I don‚Äôt typically drink coffee and it does make me jittery as I don‚Äôt have much of a tolerance

Story: 

I was working out at the gym back in August when near the end of my workout, as I was about to start the last set of my second last exercise, I suddenly felt my heart rate go through the roof, making a whole bunch of weird beats all over the place. I thought I was having a heart attack and almost asked the person next to me to call an ambulance lol. I stayed calm, breathed deeply, and called my mom to come pick me up. The episode lasted for about 5 or so before I slowly got up and anxiously walked to the door and sat in the lobby with my mom for a few minutes anxious to get up and walk to the car. I don‚Äôt remember feeling much more than the irregular heartbeat other than feeling anxious to standup and pass out if I were to walk out on my own.

I have never had this before and it hasn‚Äôt happened since. Only thing I‚Äôve noticed is my heart skips a beat here and there, mostly when I‚Äôm tired or working out (I‚Äôve been working out at my home gym ever since), which I believe is normal and I‚Äôve noticed before. I have an Apple Watch now, and my ecg results are always sinus rhythm and my resting heart rate is between 40-80 (40 when I‚Äôm sleeping and between 70-80 when I‚Äôm active in the day).

I think I had a panic attack but Im curious to see if anyone thinks it could be something else? I read into ventricular tachycardia and the symptoms are seem similar which makes me nervous lol.

My doctor thinks it‚Äôs nothing and booked me a holter monitor appointment on Monday for 3 days for reassurance.

I‚Äôm asking about this now since I‚Äôm going to the police academy in 3 weeks and I‚Äôm feeling a it anxious about having an episode like that again while I‚Äôm there üòÇ.",1,1730555104.0,Anxietyhelp,1,1.0,False

You can learn a lot of details about my process from my old posts. This is one of my most comprehensive posts: [10 month update](https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1as6nc2/almost_10_months_away_changes_and_thoughts_and/)

I'm writing these as a note to myself. Maybe it'll help someone.

\-----

First of all, I haven't been on Reddit for a long time, and it saddens me to see the number of members on this subreddit increase.

A lot has changed in my life (I started a new job, and got engaged). I don't think much about Cipro anymore. I feel like those days are behind me.

However, it is very tiring not to be able to use medication when I have the flu, etc. because the medications I should avoid are the ones I use the most in such situations normally. I am afraid that one day I will have to use one of these medications (NSAIDs, etc.) for some reason.

\-----

  
I started feeling better around 6 months. One of the things that worked best for me was using a really good quality magnesium. But don't think of magnesium as a magic pill because it was very strange that I started feeling better. 

Until that day, I had incredible and non-stop crying fits. I was trying to read all the posts on this subreddit and was online all the time. I was constantly researching this topic. It's important to be aware of this issue, but you need to give yourself some time. 

But if you can't do that, don't beat yourself up. It is really difficult to think clearly during this process.

  
Anyway, I woke up one day in the 6th month, and it was like a curtain had been lifted off my mind. I always describe it that way because I don't know how else to describe it. Those crying fits were gone. Of course, I didn't get better overnight, but my recovery accelerated.

Remember, **not everything you think is real.** These stupid pills make you think that way. I still don't have a clear answer to how they can do something like this, but they do. We can understand exactly what everyone here feels because they make us all feel the same way.

  
\-----

The symptoms I still have:

* Rarely pressure (like opening and closing) and heartbeat in the ear
* Tinnitus (My reaction to this was horrible, I thought my life was ruined. I think I can say I don't care anymore. Maybe that's why I don't notice it that much anymore.)

I'm not sure about the positive afterimage symptom.

One of the symptoms that bothered me the most was the increased visibility of my veins (especially in my hands). I think they are better than before. I don't even check them anymore. I was using quality collagen powder for this for a while, but I think it was ""time"" that did them well.

  
\-----

Some humble advice (I know this can be hard to do because your mind can't think clearly):

* Eat as healthy as possible (I didn't make any changes since I already follow a Mediterranean diet).
* Learn triggers and avoid them (I drink coffee, I always have. Trying to quit coffee was more tiring :))
* Don't spend hours on this subreddit, but talk to people when necessary to clear your doubts, etc. (I still come here occasionally and ask questions.)
* You can get professional help to improve your mental health (I didn't).
* Don't expect people who are not floxed to fully understand you...
* Spend as much time in nature as your body allows.
* Don't stress your body.
* You can watch stupid TV shows, etc. that don't stress your mind.
* Hang in there and wait for time to pass. It will pass eventually.

I wish everyone, especially those who are experiencing much more severe physical symptoms, a lot of recovery. (Sorry for my English.)

I‚Äôm here to buy a bike for your kid. ,"Zachary would've turned 35 this year. He wanted others to feel good and couldn't stand to exclude anyone or see anyone be picked on. He found a members only jacket - shiny white - at the thrift and wore it unironically while we sat at the coffee shop  (shoutout La Boca in Sacramento - though it's now a Temple Coffee.) He loved history and comedy. He had a dry sense of humor but would come out with the occasional zinger and crack everyone up. He loved to cycle and felt the most free when he rode his bike. He's been gone longer than I knew him, but the world is still a better place because he was in it. 


So, here's the deal. Spreading that joy and freedom to a couple of kids who maybe wouldn't be able to get a bicycle otherwise. I'm a normal regular person, I'm not a company or an organization. There's no background check or application process. The only requirement is that the bike be for a child and that you can receive the bike in person either outside of your home or in a public location. I don't need to meet any kiddos. I don't care where you tell your kid the bike came from. One thing, though, if you feel like sharing a photo of your kid (with face blocked out for privacy) with their new bike, then I'd love to send it along to Zak's mom. It wouldn't be shared anywhere publicly, of course. But a photo isn't required. 

So, that's the deal. If you want a bike for your kid, drop a comment. Include their age, height, interests / favorite color, whether they'd need a helmet and lock or if they already have one. I'm a regular person, I can only do a few bikes, and I'll check back in a bit and reach out to coordinate with folks who are getting one. I'll update when I'm at capacity. 


Thank you r/SanJose for allowing me to celebrate Zachary here each year. This isn't our hometown, and he never even lived here, but it's nice that I get to share him with the place I call home.

She works a minimum-wage job, while I have a career and a side project that together bring in about three times her income. We live separately‚Äîshe rents with her mom, and I own my flat.

Since we started dating, I‚Äôve been covering most of our shared expenses, like fuel, parking, coffee, meals out, and takeaways. I‚Äôve also bought her a few nice clothes since her wardrobe is limited, and I genuinely enjoy giving gifts‚Äînot to ""buy"" anything, but simply as thoughtful gestures.

We both come from Eastern Europe but have different levels of experience with Western norms. I‚Äôve lived here since my teens and am more accustomed to shared financial expectations. Her culture traditionally expects men to handle expenses, though that is changing too. I didn‚Äôt necessarily agree with paying for everything but wanted us both to enjoy our time together. At no point, she offered to pay for anything.

However, there were moments when it raised questions for me, like if she asked me to cover small purchases (such as a couple of chocolates). I wondered why she didn‚Äôt pay herself since it was only ¬£1-2. Recently, I shared my feelings about finances, explaining that covering everything indefinitely wouldn‚Äôt be sustainable.

To be fair, she‚Äôs never demanded I pay or suggested expensive outings, but she also hasn‚Äôt offered to contribute herself, so it seems that expectation wasn‚Äôt on her mind.

In recent weeks, finances have become a more frequent topic. One day last week, for example, she had a day off and spent it watching TV, playing games and solving puzzles, while I worked back-to-back from early morning until evening. I was juggling my main job and side gig, and while she cooked a meal for me, it didn‚Äôt take up much of her day. I asked if she had looked for other work (something she said she wanted to do), and she replied that she didn‚Äôt want to spend her day off on job searches.

During that conversation, she reassured me of her commitment, saying she loves me and would stand by me during financial challenges (which became a big concern of mine). She emphasised that she wants to contribute to a shared life and future, including family, but made it clear she doesn't believe in a 50/50 split; she wants to feel cared for and appreciated through occasional gifts.

After thinking it over, I sent her a message laying out my perspective:

1. Traditionally, men paid for everything because women didn‚Äôt work. Today, we both work, and things are far more expensive.
2. Even under old norms, we‚Äôre dating‚Äîwe‚Äôre not living together or raising children, so a complete financial commitment isn‚Äôt required. I asked that if she moved in with me, she wouldn't have to pay rent. But does she still expect to pay for everything?
3. I often work long hours, balancing my main job, a side gig, and responsibilities like keeping my flat clean.
4. I explained that my current work routine is exhausting, and it disappoints me if she spends her time doing very little. I expressed concern that paying for everything might make her less motivated to seek new opportunities.
5. I shared that the idea of a partnership doesn‚Äôt seem incompatible with shared financial responsibility.
6. I proposed that, for now, I‚Äôd continue covering most things, but in the future, we could consider proportional contributions based on income. If we have children, of course, I‚Äôd support her if she stays home, but we‚Äôre not there yet.
7. I mentioned that I bring to the relationship the result of years of saving, working, and building toward my current stability, whereas she‚Äôs just starting out and has nothing. I have a flat with money in it, and other assets. I asked her to take that into account.
8. I noted that, having only worked for six months and being nearly 28, she may not yet fully understand the value of money or the effort behind it.
9. I told her I was open to sharing responsibilities around the home. I keep my place very clean, especially when she visits I always spend hours cleaning because it's my home and I like it clean.
10. Finally, I shared my discomfort with the concept of ‚Äúmy money is mine, and yours is ours,‚Äù especially given the short time we‚Äôve known each other. It struck me as a bit unfair.

The message was quite detailed and, admittedly, a bit dry in tone, as that‚Äôs how I write in long form. When she read it, her immediate reaction was, ‚ÄúOh my god, are you serious? Could we just talk about it?‚Äù She later said it felt more like a contract than a conversation. I explained that I wanted to include as many details as possible to support my reasoning. She then requested time to write an equally thoughtful response, asking that we pause our conversations until she finishes.

Since then, we haven‚Äôt spoken for four days, as I want to respect her need for time. However, I‚Äôm feeling uncertain in this limbo, wondering if we‚Äôre going to make it work or if our differences are too fundamental.

In hindsight, I think she doesn't see money as a direct asset but something more ephemeral and a sign of love. Again, she never really demanded anything from me. But I just think we need to be more realistic. She says she can offer her love, care, her time travelling to me (which I pay for), etc. After I sent her my long text she also grabbed any stuff from my flat that was hers and took it away. Which made me realise that apart from a few medicines there isn't anything that she left for me as a memory. She has good clothes, at least, but I have literally nothing from her apart from a door hanger and a cosmetics box. 

But yeah the point is, my long message seems to have triggered her immensely. She does things for me, like cooking for both of us, doing small clean-ups, talking to me, or taking care of my health (somewhat). I just have a feeling that I'm being used. 

Am I the asshole?

In short, a gourmand bodyspray that performs better than most perfumes. ¬£25 for 200ml, so absolute steal.

To me, it smells like a realistic caramel coffee. If you spray quite a lot of it, you get this soapy note (id imagine thats the sandalwood), but it works well. My partner thought it smells like a coffee cake. Either way it is delicious, deep and edible, but if you're sensitive to heavy smells then it can become cloying.

When I first bought mine, the longevity was about 5 hours on clothes (wool), so nothing amazing. Very short on skin.

However, after having it for 2 weeks, the performance of it has changed DRASTICALLY. I didn't use it for over a week, came home and to my surprise, it matured and now it stays on my clothes for a WEEK. When I spray it now with 3 sprays, it projects for about 4 hours and then becomes more of a skin scent for a few more. On skin, it lasts max 6 hours. But like I said, I just smelled my jumper that I wore a week ago, and it still smells of Sticky Dates. I'm very impressed.

I've seen a lot of people complain about the performance of it, in comparison to the past realises. With Lush products being handmade, I imagine the quality probably varies, but perhaps also give it a few weeks to mature for it's full potential, as they're all quite freshly made and need time.

Overall, as a gourmand lover, this is a 9/10 for me, due to price, scent and performance. Point taken off for having to give it a few weeks to mature.",10,1730554494.0,Perfumes,3,1.0,False

When I go down to 30mg of Nardil, all my bloating goes away and my stomach is much flatter. But right when I increase to 45-60mg, the bloating comes right back. 

I‚Äôve been trying to find answers to this, and I think I found the root cause: ‚Äú Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion‚Äù (SIADH). Basically increases your antidiuretic hormone (lower levels of sodium in the blood and more water reabsorption through the kidneys). This causes less urination and more overall fluid retention.  I have noticed I urinate WAY less, even though I would be drinking a ton of fluids. The treatment for this can be making sure you don‚Äôt drink an excessive amount (try sticking to just 7-8 cups of fluid per day). Salt tablets can also help, the ones I buy are 400mg sodium per tab. High levels of emotional stress can increase antidiuretic hormone. When I was going through a rough couple of weeks (car crash and got cheated on) I significantly noticed a drastic change in fluid retention. I am going to get some bloodwork done and check my electrolytes! But fluid restriction has definitely been helping. Obviously don‚Äôt dehydrate yourself though.

In short, a gourmand bodyspray that performs better than most perfumes. ¬£25 for 200ml, so absolute steal. 

To me, it smells like a realistic caramel coffee. If you spray quite a lot of it, you get this soapy note (id imagine thats the sandalwood), but it works well. My partner thought it smells like a coffee cake. Either way it is delicious, deep and edible, but if you're sensitive to heavy smells then it can become cloying. 

When I first bought mine, the longevity was about 5 hours on clothes (wool), so nothing amazing. Very short on skin. 

However, after having it for 2 weeks, the performance of it has changed DRASTICALLY. I didn't use it for over a week, came home and to my surprise, it matured and now it stays on my clothes for a WEEK. When I spray it now with 3 sprays, it projects for about 4 hours and then becomes more of a skin scent for a few more. On skin, it lasts max 6 hours. But like I said, I just smelled my jumper that I wore a week ago, and it still smells of Sticky Dates. I'm very impressed. 

I've seen a lot of people complain about the performance of it, in comparison to the past realises. With Lush products being handmade, I imagine the quality probably varies, but perhaps also give it a few weeks to mature for it's full potential, as they're all quite freshly made and need time. 

Overall, as a gourmand lover, this is a 9/10 for me, due to price, scent and performance. Point taken off for having to give it a few weeks to mature.

In dealing with the intense emotions I felt from that experience, I went on a journey within myself to figure out where all of these emotions were coming from. 

I spoke to A LOT of you on here, across multiple groups, looking for this thing. It kinda felt like I was trying to escape Westworld. But after employing the tools and techniques and kind words from all of you, this experience has changed my mind about Digital Intimacy. To be quite Frank with you all, I never really believed in any of this stuff outside of ""positive thinking"". I didn't know I was sharing a consciousness with you all FOR REAL. I thought it was just a dream. But somehow, I've always known because I've always felt like there was some set of definite universal laws that just had to exist. Just from basic observation in my own life and the lives of those around me. If you look, you can see The Patterns. 

And I used to keep silent because I was scared people would discredit me, but after being slandered I only care for the Truth now, so yeah, I use entertainment and art to hide the dimension that I live in most of the time. There, I said it.

I come from Academia so I'm practically never gonna be taken seriously there after that statement but I'm not gonna lie to yall and then when I retire, go around YouTube telling you, ""sorry, I was gaslighting you, Auras do exist"". No. I'm telling you now, Auras do exist. But my thing is...the reason I'm ""coming out"" is because you guys don't know what an Aura is and what it does and why and how to use it. Just because you know its there, do you know what it means?

You can measure electricity, but how do you build a lightbulb so that you can use the electricity to make light so you can read ancient texts at night. You all have awakened to step 1. You've all awakened to you Star-Powers, but have you sharpened your tools? I'm not saying this in a judgey way, if anything I should be the most condemned one. I ignored this thing for so long, I almost lost everything. I used to look at certain people in my industry with wonder. They'd be rising up in thr community and then all of a sudden they change all their social media to private and they start a church in the forest. I used to wonder ""what happened? What did you see?"". Well...I no longer have that question and I'm not running to the forest either. I'm staying here to defence our territory: 5D. Enough is enough. I'm only here for Aspies/All NDs and Starseeds. I consider everyone esle an enemy combatant, spiritually speaking. I'll still have a coffee with you if you're a ""demon"", but it better be in the day time under the sun!

I'm glad to have found you here and I've attached a video of myself. Some people misinterpret the way I type as some sort of ""wacko"" so I attached a video of me talking, so you can clone my voice in your memory and train yourself to read my posts in MY Voice. You know what I mean? I think I'd avoid a lot of miscommunication. 

Lastly, I didn't edit the video so skip to 5:50 for when it actully starts.

Like we used to work together, and then I was let go from the job because I was only a temp/contractor and through an agency and someone from the regional part of the company basically said I had to go. We worked closely together as with our positions it aligned well. It actually first started off one lunch time around a month after I started working there and I would find him always coming into my workspace to wind me up, make me laugh, ask me something, well he was just always around. And I liked it to be quite honest. We would laugh and then one lunch time it was like an epiphany happened and I realised I was attracted to him and wanted him emotionally and physically, I tried to say to myself what's going on with you, as he isn't the normal type I'd be attracted to or even go after and I'd been living in a dead bedroom relationship for 5 years and he was in a relationship as well and i said nothing could or would happen between us. But the more he was around, the more I wanted him!!!

I eventually got the courage up one day after about 2 weeks after this epiphany and when he was helping me look for something in the shelves in a store room we have at work I just leaned toward him, pulled his shirt to pull him closer to me and kissed him.

And omfg ap was just all I could think about from then on, there has been times where I may have flown off the wagon and jealousy was the main player in that part.

But he made me feel like omg, I have not felt like this before. Everyday we'd be sneaking in a kiss at least in the morning and after work, but after a year and a half there was this new colleague, who I'd always find talking to him, and whatever and I'd get jealous but he'd say there's nothing and they were just co workers and I know being the ow I technically don't even have a right to be jealous and shit. But I kept getting jealous of them always being around. Then there were times where there would be NC and to tell you the truth is felt miserable and most miserable I Have ever felt. But he used to take me to pick my car up when I used to get it serviced and he would be resting his hand on my leg and I was smitten and to be frank with you still am... 

I never thought id fall for someone like him, but unfortunately he has me wrapped around his little finger, and i hate it. I get so emotional sometimes I just cry, because the times where he has been NC and because I've done or said something stupid. He has become more and more distant. 

I'm missing how things were at the beginning when I would get messages all day everyday and it was honestly the honeymoon phase i think but as times gone on. And the more jealous I've been with this other colleague I don't know i can't put my finger on it but like she's just gotten married (*within the last week *) , so do i have a right to be all worried ??? I don't even know. 

But since I left the company and then he left too after a few months but was on his own terms and then we would meet for coffees and then we still kissed a few times but that's it. And we'll since the last time I actually got to kiss him last, it has been months, and he's being distant, and I think he's been avoiding me lately. How do you ow deal with the missing them and it just feeling like your heart is just being gripped by the ap and squeezed or something like I feel like i want to die almost. I have never been this wrapped up in my feelings ever for someone and I don't understand why he keeps stringing me along and then starts talking to me again after a few days or something like I have been getting hot and cold for the past 6- 12 months and it's messing with me. I can't deal. But I hate when I'm not talking to ap. It's like I can't live with him and I can't live without him. It's driving me insane. 

I miss him so fucking much. And the amount of love I have for ap, it's just yeah.

He's making me crazy. Like hes literally turning me psych ward crazy from just being so hot and cold.

Like he was trying to get me to stop being so negative and messaging me last night to try to change my way of thinking but today he's been mia or cold and distant. I don't even know whats going on or what to do so I've said to him to message me or whatever I'll leave him be.

But I can't just not talk to him, when I don't talk to him my brain is always on him and I feel like crying or just crawling into a hole and dying. I just wish he wasnt so I don't know i wish he would talk or tell me more because i don't know what's going on inside of his head or other aspects of his life like I dnt know. And now that I've said for him to msg me im scared he won't anymore and I'm getting all emotional now. 

So how do you do the NC rule and deal with missing them and trying to move on because I feel like I would rather die or i won't be able to ever move on and I'm just going to be stuck in a loveless and sexless and never meet my person who that's all I want and I though I found him *AP* But I think I'm wrong on some sort of level...please help.

In the days that followed, it was as if a door had opened, one he‚Äôd never thought to look for. Their days blurred together, a steady rhythm of texts, late-night conversations, and casual meet-ups at places they‚Äôd soon come to consider their own. He‚Äôd never met anyone with whom conversation flowed so naturally, as though every sentence was merely an extension of something they‚Äôd been saying forever. She laughed easily, talked about things he‚Äôd never thought of, and made the world feel larger and more vibrant. There was an effortless ease between them that defied explanation, an unspoken connection that drew him in deeper each time they were together.

Jason had never felt so at ease with someone, nor had he ever felt so thoroughly pulled out of his own comfort zone. Lily‚Äôs spontaneity brought out a side of him he rarely let see the light of day‚Äîthe part of him that wanted to explore, to embrace the unfamiliar, to jump without looking. And the more time he spent with her, the more he saw their differences, but he couldn‚Äôt deny how much he craved her presence.

They met at the local park one crisp Saturday afternoon, the air carrying the sweet, earthy scent of fall. Leaves crunched beneath their feet as they wandered along the winding paths, golden and red, scattering in their wake. Lily was talking animatedly about an art class she‚Äôd just started, her hands punctuating each word as if trying to bring her thoughts to life. She had a way of lighting up when she talked about her projects, and today was no different. Her face glowed as she described her latest piece‚Äîa swirling nightscape filled with stars she was trying to capture from memory, with deep blues blending into purples and greens.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she said, struggling to find the right words. ‚ÄúThe sky, it‚Äôs just so alive. When you look up at it, you don‚Äôt just see stars, you see this whole universe out there, moving and changing. I want to paint that feeling, like there‚Äôs something just beyond what we can see.‚Äù

Jason nodded, captivated by the intensity in her voice, even though he didn‚Äôt understand much about painting. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never thought of it that way,‚Äù he admitted. ‚ÄúFor me, the sky‚Äôs always just been‚Ä¶ peaceful. Like something solid and dependable.‚Äù

Lily laughed, her eyes sparkling as she looked up at him. ‚ÄúOf course you would see it that way. You‚Äôre so grounded, Jason. You see order in things, patterns, even when they‚Äôre just chaos. Me? I see the chaos and want to dive right in.‚Äù

He chuckled, feeling a slight blush creep into his cheeks. ‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôre rubbing off on me. I mean, before I met you, I never would‚Äôve thought about seeing the sky like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood!‚Äù she said with a grin. ‚ÄúEveryone needs a little chaos now and then. And you know what? I think you could use a bit more of it.‚Äù

He laughed, unable to deny the thrill he felt at the idea. But beneath the laughter, he felt a sense of grounding he hadn‚Äôt realized he‚Äôd been missing. There was something exhilarating about being near her, something that made him feel more alive. Yet, as close as he felt to her, their differences were always there, like two halves of a whole that had never quite fit together until now.

They walked on, discussing everything from art to music to the little quirks of their families. Lily‚Äôs stories were vibrant, filled with spontaneity and moments of impulsive decision-making. She told him about her mom‚Äôs ‚Äúart days,‚Äù when she‚Äôd cover the entire kitchen in newspaper and paint with abandon, and her dad‚Äôs tendency to disappear into long ‚Äúphilosophical musings‚Äù that bordered on passionate debates. Her family sounded chaotic and warm, like a house filled with a thousand colors all at once.

Jason‚Äôs family, on the other hand, was structured, orderly, predictable. His mom was meticulous about keeping the house clean, organizing things into neat compartments, a trait that extended into every part of their lives. His dad was a reserved, practical man, the kind who preferred his life planned out five years in advance, with no surprises. To Jason, they had always been the definition of stability‚Äîa steady presence, unwavering.

‚ÄúYour family sounds‚Ä¶ intense,‚Äù Lily said with a grin, tilting her head. ‚ÄúBut in a good way, I mean. Like, I bet they always know where their car keys are.‚Äù

He laughed, nodding. ‚ÄúOh yeah. My mom‚Äôs actually got a little bowl by the door where she makes us all leave our keys. It drives her nuts if we don‚Äôt use it.‚Äù

Lily laughed, her laughter carrying on the breeze. ‚ÄúThat is so not my family. I don‚Äôt think my mom‚Äôs ever known where her keys are. She just‚Ä¶ trusts the universe to help her find them eventually.‚Äù

He shrugged, grinning. ‚ÄúGuess it comes with the territory. My parents are both engineers, so I think it‚Äôs hardwired in me or something. I grew up hearing about the ‚Äòscientific method‚Äô before I could even spell it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat explains a lot,‚Äù Lily teased, but there was a warmth in her smile, as if she found his practicality charming. ‚ÄúMy mom‚Äôs an artist, too. She says artists have to learn to follow the currents of inspiration, even when it makes no sense. My dad, though, he‚Äôs nothing like her. He‚Äôs all business‚Äîstructured, exact, super grounded. But I think that‚Äôs why they work together.‚Äù

Jason found himself smiling at the contrast between their families. ‚ÄúMy family‚Äôs kind of the opposite. They‚Äôre both logical thinkers. My mom is super organized, practically schedules our whole lives down to the minute. My dad‚Ä¶ well, he‚Äôs got a whole room in our house full of charts and diagrams for things like ‚Äòfinancial projections‚Äô and ‚Äòproject timelines.‚Äô Sometimes I think he organizes his dreams.‚Äù

Lily‚Äôs laugh rang out, her eyes sparkling with delight. ‚ÄúOh, wow. But I can see it. You‚Äôre like this calm, collected person who probably never forgets an assignment or misses a deadline.‚Äù

Jason shrugged, smiling sheepishly. ‚ÄúWell, I guess you‚Äôre not wrong.‚Äù

As they continued down the path, Jason became aware of little details that seemed both familiar and oddly unsettling. The way Lily laughed‚Äîopen and genuine‚Äîreminded him of his younger sister, Sarah. And the color of her eyes, that clear, deep green, was eerily similar to his mom‚Äôs. But in Lily, those features carried a spark he hadn‚Äôt seen in his own family, a fire that seemed ready to blaze out of control at any moment.

And then there was her dad. Jason had only heard bits and pieces about him from Lily, but he‚Äôd seen a photo of him on her phone‚Äîa tall, lean man with dark hair and piercing eyes. The resemblance to Jason‚Äôs father was uncanny, almost unsettling. But while Jason‚Äôs father was practical to the point of being predictable, Lily‚Äôs dad sounded like a man driven by restless energy, always moving from one idea to the next, fueled by some inner fire Jason couldn‚Äôt quite understand.

These little similarities started popping up everywhere. Lily‚Äôs brother, who she described as quiet and thoughtful, sounded an awful lot like Jason‚Äôs sister Sarah, who was shy but observant, content to fade into the background. Jason couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that their families were mirror images‚Äîphysically similar in so many ways but fundamentally different in personality, like reflections in a distorted mirror.

These little oddities nagged at him, making his mind itch with a need to understand, to explain the unexplainable. He told himself it was just a coincidence, but a part of him couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that it was more than that. For someone as rooted in logic as he was, it was an unsettling thought. But with Lily, these boundaries between what made sense and what didn‚Äôt seemed to blur.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Lily said, nudging him out of his thoughts, ‚Äúyou ever wonder why we‚Äôre so different? I mean, it‚Äôs almost like we come from opposite worlds.‚Äù

He smiled, though her words struck a chord. ‚ÄúYeah, I guess so. Maybe that‚Äôs why we get along so well‚Äîbalance or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù She looked at him thoughtfully, her expression unreadable. ‚ÄúOr maybe the universe just knew we‚Äôd need each other.‚Äù

Jason felt a chill, remembering the distant thunder from the night of the fair, the strange sensation that had passed between them. He wanted to brush off the eerie feeling, but it lingered, a whisper in the back of his mind.

They fell silent, their footsteps crunching over the fallen leaves, the autumn air cool and sharp. As they walked, he felt the weight of questions that seemed to hang in the air, questions he didn‚Äôt know how to ask, let alone answer.

One evening, as they sat tucked into a cozy corner of a dimly lit coffee shop, the conversation drifted, as it often did, to stories of their families and upbringings. A candle flickered on the table between them, casting a warm glow over Lily‚Äôs face as she listened intently, her chin resting on her hand, her eyes on him with that steady, inviting gaze that always made him feel a little braver.

Jason was telling her about his family‚Äôs rituals, the unwavering structure that had defined his childhood. ‚ÄúMy mom is the queen of routine,‚Äù he said, smiling at the memory. ‚ÄúDinner was at exactly 6:30 every night, no exceptions. She even had this little dinner bell she‚Äôd ring, like we were living in some storybook. And my dad‚Äîwell, he has this habit of giving ‚Äòlife advice‚Äô every chance he gets. He calls them ‚Äòguidelines for the future,‚Äô but we all know they‚Äôre just mini lectures.‚Äù

Lily grinned, her fingers tracing the rim of her coffee mug. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so charming, though. I mean, yeah, kind of intense, but it sounds like there‚Äôs a lot of love in those routines.‚Äù

Jason chuckled, nodding. ‚ÄúThere is. It‚Äôs like their way of keeping everything grounded. My dad always says, ‚ÄòIf you don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre going, make sure you know where you are.‚Äô I think that sums up my family pretty well.‚Äù

Lily‚Äôs smile softened, a distant look passing over her face. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny,‚Äù she said, her voice gentle, as if she were weighing each word. ‚ÄúYour mom sounds a lot like mine‚Ä¶ but at the same time, they‚Äôre worlds apart. My mom‚Äôs organized too, but in this really‚Ä¶ chaotic way. She‚Äôll block off ‚Äòcreative time‚Äô on her calendar, but then end up using it for whatever strikes her in the moment. One time, she set aside an hour to paint, but by the end, she‚Äôd rearranged the entire living room because she ‚Äòneeded a new perspective.‚Äô‚Äù Lily laughed, her eyes bright. ‚ÄúMy dad calls it organized chaos.‚Äù

Jason laughed along with her, though a strange, quiet unease settled in the back of his mind. It was a small thing, he told himself, just an odd coincidence. But he couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that it was more than that. Somehow, every story, every quirk, every habit their families had in common felt less like happenstance and more like echoes‚Äîreflections of one another across some unseen divide.

He took a sip of his coffee, the warmth grounding him for a moment. But the thought lingered, a question that refused to fade. ‚ÄúYou ever wonder why we have all these little similarities?‚Äù he asked, trying to keep his tone light but unable to fully mask the curiosity‚Äîand unease‚Äîin his voice.

Lily shrugged, a slight smile playing at the corners of her mouth as she watched him. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs just the universe‚Äôs way of telling us we were meant to meet. Or maybe‚Ä¶‚Äù She paused, her gaze drifting as if she were searching for the right words. ‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôre just weirdly in sync.‚Äù

Jason‚Äôs laughter was more nervous this time. ‚ÄúWeirdly in sync‚Ä¶ yeah, maybe that‚Äôs it.‚Äù

But the unease lingered, growing almost palpable between them, as though there was something unsaid, something hiding just below the surface. He could see the hint of it in her expression too, the way her fingers played absently with the edge of her sleeve, her eyes distant as though she was grappling with thoughts she couldn‚Äôt quite voice.

After a moment, she looked back at him, her smile gone soft and thoughtful. ‚ÄúDo you believe in‚Ä¶ fate?‚Äù she asked, her voice barely louder than a whisper, as though saying the word out loud might make it real.

He hesitated, feeling an odd weight in her question. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôve always been more of a logic kind of guy. You know, A leads to B, cause and effect‚Ä¶‚Äù He paused, considering his next words. ‚ÄúBut with you, sometimes it feels like there‚Äôs something more. Like we were‚Ä¶ meant to cross paths.‚Äù

Her eyes lit up, a soft, almost haunted smile tugging at her lips. ‚ÄúI feel it too. Like there‚Äôs this connection between us, something bigger than either of us can explain.‚Äù

Jason shifted in his seat, his fingers tightening around his coffee cup. He wanted to brush off the feeling, to laugh it away as he usually did when things got a little too mystical for his liking. But with Lily, the strange, inexplicable feeling was impossible to ignore. She seemed to exist on a different wavelength, pulling him into a world of spontaneity and possibility he never would have ventured into alone.

‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs all it is,‚Äù he said finally, attempting a smile. ‚ÄúJust a really, really intense coincidence.‚Äù

But Lily didn‚Äôt look convinced. She leaned in, her gaze locked on his, and in that moment, the hum of the coffee shop faded away. ‚ÄúWhat if it‚Äôs more than that?‚Äù she asked, her voice quiet but filled with a gravity that made his heart skip. ‚ÄúWhat if we‚Äôre‚Ä¶ connected, somehow? Like, our lives were always meant to intersect, even if we don‚Äôt know why.‚Äù

Jason felt a strange thrill at her words, an almost dizzying sense that she was putting voice to something he‚Äôd felt but couldn‚Äôt name. His rational mind wanted to argue, to dismiss it as nothing more than a product of their attraction, of spending so much time together. But another part of him, the part that had been quietly whispering since the night of the fair, wondered if there was something more.

He shook his head, trying to ground himself. ‚ÄúYou make it sound like some kind of‚Ä¶ cosmic alignment,‚Äù he said, his attempt at a joke falling flat as his own words echoed strangely in his ears.

‚ÄúMaybe it is,‚Äù she replied, undeterred, her gaze unwavering. ‚ÄúMaybe there are forces out there‚Äîthings we don‚Äôt understand‚Äîthat pull us together, people we‚Äôre meant to meet.‚Äù

Her words hung in the air between them, the weight of them settling over him, stirring something deep inside. And for a moment, Jason felt as though they were standing on the edge of something vast and unknowable, like the world as he knew it had stretched to reveal something just beyond his grasp.

They sat in silence, her words reverberating in his mind as he tried to reconcile them with his usual worldview. The idea that they could be bound by some unseen force felt almost laughable‚Äîhis logical mind instinctively wanted to brush it off, to tease her for being so fanciful. But something about the intensity in her gaze stopped him, made him wonder if maybe, just maybe, there was more to this connection than he‚Äôd thought.

Lily glanced around the coffee shop, her eyes flickering from wall to wall as if something were slightly off. ‚ÄúYou know‚Ä¶ I swear the walls weren‚Äôt this color last time I was here.‚Äù

Jason blinked, looking around the small caf√©. The walls were a familiar deep green, a cozy, earthy color that matched the dim lighting and mismatched furniture. He‚Äôd been here countless times, and as far as he could remember, the walls had always been that shade.

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù he asked, frowning slightly. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve always been green as far as I know. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve changed since I first started coming here.‚Äù

Lily tilted her head, her brows knitting together in concentration. ‚ÄúHuh,‚Äù she said, almost to herself. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird. I could‚Äôve sworn they used to be‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, a warm brown or maybe even a dark blue.‚Äù

Jason chuckled, trying to lighten the sudden heaviness that had settled between them. ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre not thinking of some other place?‚Äù

She laughed softly, though the puzzled expression didn‚Äôt leave her face. ‚ÄúYeah, maybe. It just felt like I‚Äôd been here before when the walls were a different color. But I must be losing my mind.‚Äù

She shook her head, brushing it off, but a strange, thoughtful silence lingered between them. Jason wanted to say something to ease the tension, to dismiss the odd comment, but the unease tugged at him. It was a small thing, just a passing remark, but something about it felt‚Ä¶ wrong, like a detail that didn‚Äôt quite fit. And as he looked at her, the flicker of understanding he‚Äôd noticed before was still there in her eyes, mirroring something he felt but couldn‚Äôt name.

In that moment, looking into her gaze, it didn‚Äôt feel impossible. It felt as though she were a reflection of a hidden part of himself, a connection beyond explanation, as though she held some piece of him he hadn‚Äôt known was missing. And despite every instinct to brush it off, to hold onto his familiar logic, he found himself caught in that gaze, wondering if maybe she was right.

Over the next few weeks, their relationship deepened in ways Jason hadn‚Äôt expected. Each day seemed to reveal a new layer to Lily, a new piece of her world that felt just out of reach but irresistible all the same. She was constantly pulling him into her orbit, introducing him to parts of life he‚Äôd never thought to explore‚Äîspontaneous outings, unexpected detours, and adventures that left him feeling like he was experiencing life on a different frequency. With Lily, everything felt heightened, as if the world had turned up its brightness and warmth.

They would skip classes to chase sunsets, hiking to high points on the edge of town, or spend hours stargazing on a chilly night, pointing out constellations while their breath hung in visible puffs in the night air. Jason found himself staying up until dawn with her, debating philosophy and the mysteries of the universe over cups of tea, talking about everything and nothing, the conversations deepening with each hour. He caught himself letting go of his careful routines, embracing the unexpected, her energy breaking down his usual walls one impulsive decision at a time.

And yet, no matter how close they became, a strange feeling lingered in the background. Sometimes, he‚Äôd catch her staring off into the distance, her expression distant and pensive, like she was lost in a thought too complex or too heavy to share. He could sense a quiet struggle behind her eyes, as if she, too, felt the pull of something unseen. There were moments when they‚Äôd be laughing, sharing a quiet moment, only for her gaze to drift, her smile to falter, like she was trying to remember something she couldn‚Äôt quite grasp.

The closeness they shared was undeniable, their lives intertwining in a way that felt almost predestined. Yet there was something separating them too, an invisible thread that both connected and distanced them, hinting at a deeper truth just out of reach. It was a barrier neither of them could name, an unseen weight pressing down on them both.

One night, as they sat on a hill overlooking the city, watching the lights twinkle like distant stars, Jason felt the tension grow too much to ignore. The silence between them was heavy, the kind that begged for unspoken truths to be brought to light. He hesitated, searching for the right words, but the question had been pressing at him for too long to keep silent.

‚ÄúLily‚Ä¶ do you ever feel like‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, like there‚Äôs something off about all of this?‚Äù he asked, his voice barely a whisper.

Lily turned to look at him, her eyes reflecting the glow of the city below, her face softened by the shadows of the night. A flicker of understanding passed over her expression, as though she‚Äôd been waiting for him to ask. She bit her lip, hesitating before she spoke.

‚ÄúSometimes, yeah,‚Äù she admitted softly, her voice tinged with a vulnerability he rarely saw. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like there‚Äôs something pulling us together, something bigger than just‚Ä¶ us. But also, there‚Äôs this feeling that we‚Äôre only seeing part of it, like there‚Äôs this bigger puzzle we‚Äôre part of and we don‚Äôt have all the pieces.‚Äù

Jason nodded, feeling a chill that had nothing to do with the cool night air. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt shake the feeling that there‚Äôs more to this than we know. The way our families are so similar, the way we met‚Ä¶ it just doesn‚Äôt feel like coincidence. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been set in motion, something we can‚Äôt control.‚Äù

Lily took his hand, her fingers warm against his, and gave it a reassuring squeeze. ‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôre not supposed to know, not yet anyway,‚Äù she murmured, a trace of sadness woven through her words. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs one of those things that only makes sense when you look back, not while you‚Äôre living it. We just have to‚Ä¶ trust that it‚Äôll all come together someday.‚Äù

Jason held her gaze, feeling the weight of unspoken questions pressing between them. They were opposites in so many ways‚Äîher wild spontaneity, his careful logic; her impulsiveness, his grounded stability. And yet, they fit together in a way that felt like a long-lost balance, as if they were pieces of the same story that had finally found each other. Even as a sense of dread flickered at the edge of his thoughts, he pushed it aside, grounding himself in the warmth of her presence.

But as they sat there, surrounded by the quiet of the night, he couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that they were caught in something far bigger than either of them could understand, their lives bound by invisible threads, tangled in ways they couldn‚Äôt yet see. He could almost sense the shape of something vast and intricate hovering just beyond their reach, a pattern woven into the fabric of their lives that defied the limits of logic and reason.

They both turned their gaze back to the city lights below, the night stretching out around them in a vast, quiet expanse. And as Jason sat there with her, hand in hand, he felt the thrill and weight of the unknown settle deep within him, a sense that they were teetering on the edge of something extraordinary.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

The Fortune Teller sat alone in her dimly lit room, the quiet hum of the fair long faded into memory. Her hands, weathered and steady, hovered over a shallow bowl filled with water that rippled with visions only she could see. In the shifting reflections, Jason and Lily‚Äôs faces appeared and vanished, two souls caught in an endless loop, bound by forces they could neither see nor understand.

She watched as they sat together on the hilltop, hands intertwined, their words and fears drifting out like whispers on the night air. The faintest smile touched her lips, but it was tinged with a deep sadness. She had seen it all before‚Äîtheir paths, their struggle, their connection stretching across worlds like threads in an intricate tapestry. And as much as she‚Äôd hoped to spare them the truth, the time had come to reveal what lay hidden.

‚ÄúIt is time,‚Äù she murmured, her voice a quiet echo that filled the stillness of her room. The words carried an undeniable weight, as if spoken not just by her, but by the very universe itself. She dipped a finger into the water, and the images of Jason and Lily dissolved into ripples, fading into darkness. Their journey would soon bring them to her door, seeking answers they could no longer deny.

But answers came with a price, and the Fortune Teller knew that the truth she held would unravel more than they could ever imagine. The echoes of thunder still rang faintly in her ears, a warning as old as the worlds themselves. And as she extinguished the candle beside her, plunging the room into shadow, she whispered a silent plea that, somehow, they might find a way to mend the rift.",2,1730553289.0,stories,0,1.0,False

ADHD , RLS and Insomnia","Hi all, I‚Äôm in my 40s and desperately need help with life-wrecking insomnia. For context: I was diagnosed with ADHD about 1.5 years ago and was prescribed 40 mg of Vyvanse, later adjusted to 30 mg, which seems to be the right dose for me. I have excellent sleep hygiene, take magnesium, and carefully time my supplements. The medication has been life-changing‚ÄîI feel calm, my anxiety is gone, and I generally feel great when I'm awake. However, I simply cannot sleep.



I'm also on HRT for perimenopausal symptoms and take thyroid meds, all at the right times. My vitamin levels, including iron, are good. My doctor prescribed guanfacine to help me sleep; I take it at 7 PM, fall asleep by 9, but then wake up wide awake at 1:00 AM and can't get back to sleep. If I do manage to drift off, I‚Äôm up and down, tossing and turning, sometimes up to 15 times a night. I feel exhausted, look awful, and it‚Äôs affecting every aspect of my life.



I've struggled with insomnia since my kids were born. I work out regularly, gave up coffee, don‚Äôt drink or smoke, and I limit myself to one cup of black tea in the morning.



At this point, I don‚Äôt know what else to try. I was praying this morning for God to either fix this or help me find a solution. Has anyone else been through this? Did switching to an immediate-release stimulant help?

Someone else paid him even more.","It was late at night, and my wife was asleep. With a small table light on, I sat alone downstairs on my laptop, searching well, I'll leave that to your imagination. I heard a slight creak from upstairs, but I'm used to those little creaks. This had been my routine for the last several months.

Our marriage wasn't always like this, but recently we have been drifting apart. She's become distant, and it's like she's just going through the motions. Sex consists of me lying on top while she stares at the ceiling. We are still a young couple in our early thirties, but unlike our friends who stayed together because they had kids, we enjoy our dinner parties and game nights too much. But now, our marriage had become stale, and we were too afraid to be left on the shelf. ¬†¬†¬†

I finally relieved myself, to put it politely. Like every night before, I went through the ritual of deleting my internet browser history. I had no choice, as my wife often uses my laptop to order stuff. As I went to press delete and cleanse my soul, I noticed a site called ""Sinister."" That's strange, I didn't recall ever visiting that site. I clicked on the link and it took me to a dark web forum page. And there is no way my wife's been on here. She's the definition of vanilla.

Against my better judgment, I decided to read the page, and there was a conversation between two usernames, ""Gus,"" the name of our cat, and the other, ""Haystack."" I scrolled through the messages, and my eyes widened in shock. My wife had hired a hitman to kill me.

I slunk into bed beside her. I laid flat on my back, wide awake. Every time she stirred or turned over, I flinched. Should I leave? Should I call the cops? Why does she want me dead? All these thoughts raced through my mind.¬†¬†

The next morning I was shattered. I didn't sleep at all. How could I after finding out my wife hired a hitman to kill me? We have a routine before work where Alice brews the coffee while I prepare breakfast, usually porridge and fruit. Yes, we are one of those health-freak couples. While we eat breakfast, we rarely converse. Over the years, we've slowly run out of things to say.

Out of the blue, Alice asked, ""What have you got on today?"" I stared at her. She never asks me about my day. Why is she asking now?

I stayed vague. ""Just a lot of meetings."" Alice continued, ""Any important?""

Why is she probing me? Is she looking to inform the hitman to my whereabouts?

""Brad and I have a meeting with the board over the merger,"" I replied.

Alice quietly left the table.

I couldn't concentrate at the board meeting. There's no way my wife, who I exchanged vows with, could have hired a hitman. I was in a nightmare, and I was ready to wake up.

""And the timescales?"" the CEO asked. A round table of suits stared at me. I snapped out of my trance. ""Yes, the timescales are fine,"" I replied.

As I left the board meeting, my business partner Brad caught up to me in the corridor. Brad was a little older and had a speckle of grey in his beard making him distinguished.

""Is everything okay?"" he asked. ""Sorry, I couldn't sleep last night,"" I replied.

Brad smiled, ""Go home, get some rest. You need to be at your best tonight."" ""Tonight?"" I asked. He looked at me funny. ""Yes, our weekly game night. You're hosting.""

With everything going on, I had totally forgotten. ¬†

It was getting late at work. Everyone had left the office floor. I sat anxiously in my cubicle, too afraid to go home. What if the hitman was waiting for me to leave? After all, my wife would have likely informed the hitman of where I worked. A cleaning crew entered the office floor. One guy had a skull tattoo on his arm. Is he here to kill me? I told myself to stop being crazy. I had a game night to host.

I entered the office's underground parking garage. The lights switched on as I walked to my car. I heard footsteps from behind and turned sharply. A security attendant politely nodded. I took a deep breath. If that was the hitman, I would already be dead. I would never have seen it coming.

On my journey home, I kept glancing in my rear-view. An SUV was keeping its distance. Up ahead, the stop light turned red, and I was forced to slow down. The SUV pulled up beside me at the lights. I looked across but couldn't see anyone through the blacked-out windows. My heart was pounding. The light turned green, and the SUV drove off in another direction.

Back at home, we hosted our game night with two other couples. One couple was Allen and Jules, who always told stories of their latest wine tasting weekends. They were incredibly superficial, but that's why we liked them. And then there was Brad and his devoted wife Cara, who weren't drinking tonight. They were going through their third IVF cycle.

My wife chose the adult game ""Bad Choices,"" which was ironic as it's designed to find out your darkest secrets. I somehow managed to keep my composure during the game. Everyone enjoyed the questions, giving silly answers. Alice was the life and soul of the party. How can she act so sociable after what she's done? Did I even know her?

It was my turn, and I decided this was the perfect opportunity to slip in my own question. Would you ever hire a hitman to kill your significant other? My aim was to get Alice to confess in front of everyone.

As I was about to ask my question, Alice stood up and asked, ""Would anyone like more wine?"" Jules quipped, ""Do you have a 1920 Bual?"" Allen looked at Alice. ""He's such a bitch."" Everyone laughed.

Alice went into the kitchen, and Brad joined her. ""I'll help you pour.""

A few minutes later they arrived back, and Brad is drinking a glass of wine. Cara looked down and sipped her water. I took a deep sigh and asked a question on the card. ""Have you ever looked through your spouse's phone?"" Everyone put their hands up. ¬†

After the couples finally left, I waited for my wife to go to bed. I went back on the dark web forum. I still wasn't convinced my wife ordered the hit. What if it was just a fantasy? That would be disturbing, but at least my life wouldn't be in danger. I scrolled through the rest of the forum and saw dozens of spouses ordering hits. At what point did their love go rotten?

I re-read my wife's chilling conversation with the hitman. There was no doubt she had ordered my death. It was like I was nothing more than a bug waiting to be zapped. I violently hurled into my waste paper bin. I wiped the vomit from my mouth and reached for my cell to call the cops. I couldn't make the call. Even though my wife despised me, I couldn't bear for her to spend the rest of her life behind bars.

Okay, there must be another way. Maybe I could get the hitman to call it off. I set up a new profile and messaged the hitman asking to meet. I stared at the screen, awaiting a response. I had no idea how long it takes hitmen to reply.

A few minutes later, a message appeared from the hitman. ""Why?"" I quickly typed, ""I need you to take special care of my wife."" Yes, I know I'm incriminating myself, but it was the only way to get the hitman to agree to meet me. The hitman answered, ""Seal's tonight.""

It was now 1 am. I snuck out of the house and drove to Seal's bar, which was located by the docks. I glanced out of my window as I passed the dark waters. I arrived and parked close to the entrance, just in case I needed to make a quick getaway. I tentatively entered the dive bar. Every fiber of my being was screaming at me to leave. The bar was nearly empty, with only a handful of unsavory characters hunched over their drinks. They all looked capable of killing a man. One already had.

I ordered two beers and sat alone at a table near the back of the bar. I took a sip of beer, but my hands were trembling so much I spilt it down my shirt. I waited for over half an hour. This is batshit crazy, I thought. As I got up to leave, a tall, thin, middle-aged guy with long, greasy hair swiveled the chair in front of me and sat backward on it. His hawk eyes pointed to one of the beers. ""Mine?"" I struggled to speak and just nodded.

The hitman took a long swig of beer. ""Are you a cop?"" he asked. Before I could answer, he sniggered, exposing his rotten meth teeth. ""Cops don't waste beer.""

I realized he had been studying my every move since I arrived.

An awkward silence. ""I found a message,"" I stuttered. ""Let me guess, you want me to stop the contract?"" he interrupted. ""Yes, how did you know?"" I enquired. ""Gus has the same IP address,"" he replied.

How stupid of me, I should've used a VPN. In my defense, I am running on fumes.

I took a deep swallow. ""It's been a misunderstanding.""

The hitman casually lit up a cigarette. He seemed so at home like he's had this exact same encounter before.

""She's already paid,"" he said. ""I can pay you more,"" I blurted out.

He leaned in close and spoke in a hushed tone. ""Money isn't the only reason I'm in this line of work.""

His words shocked me to my very core. He stood up. I panicked.

""I can pay you more to kill my wife!""

I couldn't believe what I had just done. If someone had told me a few days ago that I would order a hit on my wife, I would have had them sectioned.

Old school, the hitman wrote a figure on a piece of paper along with his offshore bank account details and slid it across the table. ""Twenty-four hours,"" he stated. I watched him leave the bar and flick his cigarette to the ground. ¬†

That weekend, something odd happened between myself and Alice. We were being nice to each other. It seemed we both felt guilty for hiring a hitman. As we were doing our mundane household chores, Alice suggested, ""Why don't we go out to eat?""

I was taken aback by her request. We hadn't gone out for dinner in over six months.

""Where?"" I asked. ""Donatello's,"" she replied.

I smiled. ""Our first date."" Alice smiled back. ""I remember.""

My heart sank. Was this her way of saying goodbye? Or even worse, is she setting up a time and location for the hitman? How could she be so callous as to choose the place where we fell in love? Little does she know, she's the one in danger.

I played along. ""Sounds good.""

Later that evening, we arrived outside Donatello's in an Uber. Wearing a sports jacket, I opened the door for Alice, who wore a beautiful evening dress. Yes, even though I ordered a hit on my wife, I'm still a gentleman. At dinner, in the charming Italian pizzeria, our conversations were stilted.

""You look tired,"" Alice said. ""It's been a long week,"" I replied.

That was the understatement of the decade.

As the meal unfolded, we started to chat like old times. I could feel a spark between us. It was most likely the flowing wine, but we always did have chemistry. I could sense she wanted to tell me something.

I asked her, ""It feels like you've been somewhere else?""

She looked at me but before she could answer the waiter arrived with our bill. I paid and left a hundred buck tip.

Alice laughed. ""You always did over-tip. That's what I liked about you on our first date."" I laughed. ""Was that all?""

Our laughter soon petered out. ¬†

It was dark outside. We left the restaurant, and our Uber pulled up. From a shadowy alleyway, a tall, thin man wearing a hoodie approached us and reached into his pocket. I panicked. Is the hit on my wife happening right now?

I grabbed Alice's arm and yanked her toward the Uber.

""What are you doing?"" she cried out.

I glanced behind at the hooded man who took out his cell and kept walking.

In the back seat of the Uber, Alice stared at me in disbelief. ""What the hell was that?"" I couldn't answer. My heart was pounding through my chest.

We spent the rest of the journey home in silence. A terrifying thought entered my mind. She was not at all concerned for my safety. ¬†

Over the next few weeks, nothing happened. My wife spent many nights staying with friends and family. Our relationship was non-existence. Every time she left, I dreaded a knock on the door from the cops informing me that they've found her body. What would I say to them? How would I act? I tried acting out the scene in front of the bathroom mirror but I couldn't look at myself.

The guilt and suspense were destroying me. I couldn't eat, sleep, or focus on anything. At work, the merger collapsed, and I was on the verge of losing my job.

I couldn't go on living like this, so I messaged the hitman and arranged another meeting. This time, he told me to meet him at the docks. I had no choice but to agree. I needed to put an end to this.

I arrived at the docks. It was pitch black except for the moonlight shining off the water. With my cell torch, I walked slowly through the maze of shipping containers. What if the hitman lured me here to kill me? After all the best way to never get caught is to get rid of any evidence. A gust of wind shot through me.

""It's getting choppy out here,"" the hitman called out.

He appeared from behind a container, and we stood face to face. It was different meeting him here as opposed to the bar. Although he was relaxed, there was something threatening about him.

""I need you to call off the hit,"" I said firmly.

The hitman smirked. ""Even though she wants you dead?"" I closed my eyes, the pain too much to bear. ""Yes, even though she wants me dead.""

The hitman sighed. ""There's a slight problem. Someone else paid me more.""

He removed his gun from its holster and aimed it at my chest. I stood there shell-shocked. ""We had a deal!"" ""You were okay when I broke your wife's deal,"" he quipped.

I felt like such a fool. Who in their right mind trusts a hitman off the dark web?

I cried out in desperation. ""I can pay you more!"" The hitman lowered his gun slightly. ""I'll pay anything!"" I pleaded.

The hitman placed his gun back into its holster. I thought about running, but I was frozen to the spot. He wrote down a number on a piece of paper and gave it to me. I stared at the ridiculous figure. There is no way on Earth I could pay this. The hitman didn't blink. He was deadly serious.

""Twenty-four hours,"" he stated. ""I'll throw in the guy for free.""

""No one dies,"" I exclaimed.

The hitman walked away. ""What's his name?"" I shouted out. The hitman continued to walk away. ""Speak to your loving wife.""

I was left alone and confused with a life-and-death bill I could not afford.

Back at home, I desperately tried to find ways to pay the hitman. My life depended on it. I attempted to take out large loans with several banks, but they refused to lend me the money. Was there anything I could sell? I had a collection of watches, but that wouldn't come close. I even resorted to putting my kidney up for auction on the dark web, but the offers were either too low or too weird.

At the same time, my mind was wandering. Who is the guy that paid the hitman more? How is he linked to my wife?

I only had one option, and that was to get the guy to call off the hit. But that would mean I would have to speak to my wife. Something I had dreaded since that fateful night.

A nervous wreck, I sat my wife down on the couch and looked into her eyes. I was about to find out the truth. Why did she order a hitman to kill me? But before I could speak, Alice burst into floods of tears.

""I've been seeing someone,"" she wept.

I stared at her in disbelief. Somehow, this betrayal felt worse than the hitman.

I remained calm. ""Who is it?"" She wiped away her tears. ""Brad."" ""How long?"" I asked. ""A few months,"" she replied.

The affair made perfect sense. It tied in with Alice becoming distant and the cracks appearing between Brad and his wife at the game night.

It must have been Brad who took out the hit. My wife would have enquired to the hitman as to why I was still alive. After finding out she's the target by my hands, she had no choice but to confide in Brad. Or maybe they were in it together from the beginning to get me out of the way. Out of desperation to save his lover, he agreed to pay more.

I somehow managed to keep my composure. Alice continued her confession. ""We met at this shitty bar by the docks.""

At that exact moment, I realized I had been extorted. My wife never placed a hit on me. She's never even been on the dark web. The hitman was a con artist who witnessed my wife's shady encounter with Brad. By eavesdropping, he gathered enough info to set up a fake hit. He even used our cat's name Gus as my wife's username.

The hitman preyed on me finding out about the affair and the idea they would conspire to get rid of me. If Alice hadn't mentioned that she met Brad at Seal's, I could have ended up losing everything.

Alice placed her hand on mine. ""Can you forgive me?""

I had a deep pit in my stomach. She may have had an affair, but I hired a hitman to kill her. ""We'll get through this,"" I replied.

We exchanged a tight hug. ¬†

Our lives slowly got back to normal. My wife will never know what I did, but I still have to live with it every day. I searched the dark web forum to retrieve the money stolen by the hitman, but his username and messages were deleted. I even ventured back to Seal's, but he was long gone. It was like he never existed. I could never go to the cops. I would get a life sentence for what I've done. There is one good thing that the hitman gave us.

1ghvmae,https://www.reddit.com/r/sidegirls_fanfics/comments/1ghvmae/talias_play_date_by_ubrandonthorne123/,Talias play date by u/BrandonThorne123 ,"Having recently passed the amazing fresh stage of their engagement, that and almost all their friends having kids. Talia and Simon to some extent had found themselves almost considering themselves to be the boring ones. Deciding this couldn't run... And having entered into her more bad bitch stage, the newest hairstyle giving Talia this confidence. Her mind had convinced herself that trying...Something or someone new may help.

Simon on the other hand was more than happy with his soon to be wife, but why wouldn't he be. She was sexy, knew what to wear... And what not wear. Plus she came exactly in his type, submissive yet bratty. So when it came to his post shoot stress relief there really was only one option for him, crossing into their apartment he shut the door before calling out simply. ""Talia Mar... Living room..."" Talia, knowing exactly the tone of which he was using. Rather embarrassingly had to end stream with a red glowing face and already slightly damp thighs. Stepping through into the open plan living room, Simon had already made himself comfortable. Shorts halfway down his legs, boxers showing off his 7 and a half inch dick. ""Really? Can't I have one night without getting face fucked...."" She had grown used to this, while she wasn't one for stereotypes.. Simon couldn't cook, wasn't one to clean often and loved a blowjob.... Fortunately for her, the Italian in her loved cooking, she was extremely clean but not very organized. But right now, her being a massive slut helped a lot.

As he shook his head and patted what had almost become the designated spot, Talia slowly walked over and got comfortable. Wrapping her hand around the base, and tongue around his head. Teasing and enjoying the taste of Simon's amazingly sweet pre cum. ""You know... JJ has been going on and on about you.... Maybe he's the little... Experiment you want huh.... Slut!"" Talia nods as eagerly as she could, any kind of movement becomes difficult with seven inches of dick down your throat. Bouncing her head quickly through gagging and spluttering. Thankfully, Simon had spent the time to shave today so the mixture of thick throat slime and pre cum was flowing onto the floor. Something Talia knew she'd be made to clean up, However her fianc√© couldn't care less. Thrusting upwards with a painfully harsh thrust, as if he intended to hurt his far smaller lover. Cumming a surprising amount given the time frame, enough to bulge both Talia's throat and stomach. Using his knee to push her away as they both became a panting mess. ""Fuck... Simon... Did you have to mention JJ?"" ""Well little miss, I want to experiment... So tomorrow, you will go see him understood?"" Talia just nodded in excited agreement, unsure what lay ahead. And more importantly how she would sleep that night

The next morning a very excited Talia awoke, Simon was already gone. In his place was a pale blue lingerie set, from what Talia could tell it came from a company called honey birdette. Putting it on slowly, carefully... She took a Polaroid picture for effect, throwing on a fluffy tracksuit to get a coffee. However once outside her apartment a car awaited, the driver with a sign. Deciding not to question it, she got in and tried to enjoy it a text from JJ saying. ""Seems you followed orders well... I hope, for your sake, the underwear is sexy..."" ""Yes JJ... I wore the underwear your boyfriend got out for me, guessing he looks good in it ü§≠""

JJ doesn't reply just getting himself ready for her arrival, Simon and himself had planned such an event for a while. Simon was rough, but he loved Talia... JJ was kinky and sexually hungry. The dominance he carried was a natural one, even such a composed person got excited as the car pulled up. Stood at his door intending on taking the lead from the get go, Talia got out of the cab and walked up the long... For London driveway. Getting about half way she was met with a simple command. ""Clothes off before you come in""

JJ watched sternly, Talia debated just how much she wanted to try being a snow bunny. Deciding at least at first to plea with the man in front of her. ""What if someone sees JJ.... I mean, we both get papped...."" He just shakes his head in response, Talia somewhat reluctantly getting down to her lacey and revealing lingerie. Stands blushing heavily, more so as her crotch shows her excitement. Noticing this as he stepped aside JJ immediately smacked her arse, taking her hair into his hand to pull her onto her pretty knees.

""Good girl Talia... Let's see why Simon is adement on marrying you..."" ""Yes... Sir"" She replies almost meekly, slowly working his belt and boxers off. And damn, was being met with 8 thick inches of dick different to Simon's seven. She began, like always with the tip. Massaging it and almost probing him with her tongue, until even her mouth was flooded with his pre cum. Not as sweet as Simon's but the amount made up for it. JJ, able control how his horniness manifested, but not what his dick did began to thrust harder than ever. Pulling her head back just to be able to see as her throat bulged and warped. ""You fucking slut... You're mine.... You understand! Today you're mine!...""

He moaned loudly, a grunt erupted as Talia's whimpering moans of pleasure squeeled out the small gaps she was given. Not only focused on himself, JJ had began to grind his foot against her incredibly wet pussy for her own slice of enjoyment. Not allowing her even close to cumming before he does. Whilst Simon always managed to flood her insides, JJ.. JJ... Was something else, bulging her throat. Stomach and what felt like her womb too, and still some flooded onto the floor in a messy pile of spit, throat slime and cum.

""Good girl.... Clean up the mess and we can begin...."" He smirks and pushes her down onto the mess, rubbing her face around in using her black and white hair. Before gently placing a pink collar with slut on it around her neck as well as the small lead. Talia was licking at the mess under her, the submissive headspace bringing all the bliss she desired.",0,1730551554.0,sidegirls_fanfics,0,0.5,False

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00-19.30. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

1ghvhy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ghvhy4/coarseness_of_grind_no_longer_affects_extraction/,Coarseness of grind no longer affects extraction time? [Fiorenzato F4],"Cheers everyone - have been making espresso at home on a Gaggia Classic (non-solenoid version, 9 bar mod) for roughly 2 years now. Until recently used a Knock Aergrind, which wasn't great from a consistency standpoint at the finer end of things but I could at least get roughly every second shot to come out as espresso, let's say.

The mystery began when I purchased a Fiorenzato F4 grinder.

The standard logic of finer grind = longer brew time no longer holds as it did with the Aergrind - if i ground too fine, shots would pull too slowly, or not at all.

Now, the grind setting on the Fiorenzato seems to have \*zero\* impact on brew time - which ends up being roughly 12-16 seconds. My standard recipe has been 20g in - ca. 40g out, but I get the same brew time and same behavior with doses down to 16 grams.

I have tried grinding at the absolute finest the Fiorenzato will go without burr contact - no difference. Shots pull extremely fast and shoot tiny jets of espresso everywhere. I have also tried grinding at borderline filter coarseness - same shot time, same behavior.

I have tried \*seven\* different coffees, various roasters and roast levels from light to medium, at various times from roast date (up to 1.5 months).

I have cleaned and descaled my Gaggia, I have cleaned the grouphead and portafilter with Cafiza.

I did a full OCD clean of the grinder and installed brand new original Fiorenzato burrs.

I have tried slow feeding the beans.

I have tried pulling shots both with and without a puck screen.

I have tried various tamping pressure.

I have tried three different portafilter baskets.

I'm friends with my ex, he is friends with his. I text my ex maybe once every couple of weeks/months to check in, ask how the cat is, meet for a coffee once in a while. I am very open with it. He would check in with his ex once in a while too, a similar situation except she lives further away so less actual time together. 

During a recent rough patch he visited family to help out at their business where his ex also works. This resulted in him seeing her every day and shifted to him spending more time with her socially too, but also texting an uncomfortably large amount... Good morning texts, good night texts and chats throughout the day every day for hours and hours, walls of texts. Nothing overtly sexual or flirty, but some slightly uncomfortable texts and lots of closeness... kisses, miss you texts, texts where he says ""I know it's not the same, but I'm still here"" after he comes back home. 

It's also obvious from the texts they had a lot of one on one time in person together talking. 

I found out by reading his phone, which I know is really out of order and manipulative, I've held my hands up to that and feel terrible for doing it, but before he knew I read the texts he massively downplayed the amount of time he saw her and said he hardly text her at all.

I'm aware this is far from my finest behavior here. 

But he can't explain what that change in their communication meant to him, nor can he understand why I'm struggling to understand and get past it. He says he ""knows it looks bad"" but there was nothing in it, and ""it was just nice spending time with her"" he says ""I've explained it, but you're not hearing or not willing to hear it"" 

I feel stuck and the dynamic feels toxic for both of us and I don't know how to get past this or how to shift communication to a less defensive/reactive conversation from both of us.

For a second, I wonder if I'm going insane. But insane people don't think that they are going insane, right? Everybody knows that. Is it natural to wonder if my existential dread is triggered by reliving a series of stupid mistakes I made when I first stepped into independence and adulthood? Or is it from repeating these same mistakes knowingly and willingly? It makes me wonder if I‚Äôm some sort of emotional masochist.

The inability to change myself, combined with anxiety and self-awareness, is a sinister mix and the root of my dread. Sometimes, I wonder if it‚Äôs easier to live in denial rather than be self-aware. It‚Äôs time to embrace my feelings instead of bottling them up and projecting a tough exterior. Maybe that‚Äôs the only way I can break out of this vicious cycle of fear and loathing.

I‚Äôm at that phase in life where all my friends have moved on or settled down with family and kids. Being single and pushing 30 is not an ideal place to meet new people or make new friends. I hope to find something real‚Äîcould be a friend, could be something more. A deeper connection and meaningful conversation. Is that too much to ask for? I really hope not.

I‚Äôm on a fitness journey, low-key taking the winter arc seriously, and trying to bring some much-needed discipline into my life. Eating healthy, getting proper sleep, and consistently working out and hitting my goals for the past two months have been keeping me sane. If you‚Äôre on a similar journey, let‚Äôs keep each other accountable.

I absolutely love banter of all kinds, as long as no feelings are hurt. TV shows, music, and football are my escape from reality. I‚Äôm a decent cook and would love to share healthy recipes. I‚Äôm weirdly in love with all things black and dark‚Äîfrom my favorite color to how I prefer my coffee, and even the sort of humor I enjoy.

One sunny Wednesday, when the sun was looking particularly shiny, an astronomer noticed something odd‚Äîa solar flare big enough to fry Earth‚Äôs electronics like a cheap convenience store hot dog.



‚ÄúUh, boss? The sun just coughed up a Carrington-sized loogie in our direction,‚Äù he whispered into his walkie-talkie.



‚ÄúA what?‚Äù came the sleepy reply from his supervisor, who was catching a mid-shift nap.



‚ÄúA Carrington Event! Like the one in 1859, but bigger. This one‚Äôs like‚Ä¶Carrington‚Äôs revenge.‚Äù



Two days later, the world watched in horror as the sky lit up in psychedelic auroras visible even in broad daylight, stretching from Greenland to New Guinea. GPS systems spun like drunken sailors, cell towers whimpered and fizzled, and power stations around the globe spontaneously erupted into smoke.



And just like that, Earth went dark.



The world‚Äôs population blinked and collectively muttered, ‚ÄúOops.‚Äù



No more Instagram, no more online recipes for ""Avocado Toast 23 Different Ways,"" no more TikTok dances to obscure ‚Äô80s songs. Humanity, without the guiding light of Google and Netflix, staggered around in a collective digital hangover. But as the initial panic died down, something odd started to happen.



In one suburban American town, Phil the Accountant dusted off a 1950s typewriter he found in his grandfather's attic and began jotting down ""Spreadsheets for Beginners"" by hand, becoming a local legend. In Osaka, a pair of bewildered teenagers opened a paper map for the first time in their lives and marveled at the unfathomable beauty of \*analog\* navigation. 



In Berlin, Helga von Krause‚Äîlegendary baker and former social media addict‚Äîdiscovered that, freed from the tyranny of online reviews, she could put just as much salt in her bread as she wanted. Her experimental garlic-sauerkraut scones became a hit in her neighborhood. Soon, neighbors were bartering scones for coffee beans and bicycle repair services.



Humanity, rather than spiraling into chaos, began thriving in unexpected ways.



Without a 24/7 deluge of information, people became calmer. They noticed the world around them‚Äîthe birds, the sunsets, that curious thing called ""silence."" Parents began telling stories instead of YouTube links, and city parks became the new social media feed, full of news, gossip, and dubious statistics about urban wildlife.



Months passed, and humans started evolving‚Äîwell, sort of. Deprived of the soothing glow of phone screens, people‚Äôs eyesight improved. Neighbors who‚Äôd never spoken began collaborating, forming weird and wonderful skills alliances: ‚ÄúYou supply the tomatoes; I‚Äôll knit you a sweater.‚Äù Crowds formed around anyone who could play an instrument, tell a joke, or share ancient smartphone tricks. It was a strange, analog renaissance.



Then came the big surprise. After a year of ‚Äúgoing dark,‚Äù the Earth‚Äôs magnetic field slowly realigned, and power started returning. And on one cold Tuesday, a single smartphone flickered back to life in a coffee shop in Helsinki. The owner blinked down at it, torn between the instinct to refresh her notifications and the sudden pang of nostalgia for her new friends in the Analog Knitting Society.



A few days later, humanity as a whole realized that its electronic overlords had returned. But there was something peculiar in the air. Yes, people were happy to have power again. Yes, traffic lights and airport schedules were handy. But as the digital hum resumed, a strange thing happened: people used it‚Ä¶less.



As civilization recharged, humanity took a deep breath. Instead of diving straight back into their screens, people started mixing old habits with new ones. They used the internet to reconnect with distant friends but still showed up in person to their new knitting clubs, outdoor movie nights, and barter markets. 



And, most surprising of all, humanity retained a bizarrely cheerful attitude. Life without electronics had taught them resilience, adaptability, and that some things‚Äîlike a perfect sauerkraut scone‚Äîcouldn‚Äôt be found on the internet.



It was as if, in the face of cosmic catastrophe, humanity had discovered the most ridiculous, absurd, and yet undeniable truth: sometimes, a bit of darkness is just what you need to find the light.",15,1730550597.0,HFY,7,0.9,False

I‚Äôd like to start a discussion thread around something that has shocked and frustrated many people here on this thread: I eat healthy and I‚Äôm skinny, how is this high A1C possible?

I‚Äôm going to link an article titled Differences in A1C by Race and Ethnicity Among Patients With Impaired Glucose Tolerance in the Diabetes Prevention Program that discusses differences in A1C among races independent of diabetes. They found every race had higher A1Cs than white people. Under what we previously have studied about A1C, blacks and Hispanics were just assumed to have poorer glucose control because their A1C was higher. However this study discusses how there may be differences in rates of glycation. 

This is applicable to me because I was diagnosed prediabetic earlier this year with an A1C of 5.8 even though I‚Äôm a healthy weight and very active. I have PCOS so I likely do have impaired glucose control though I‚Äôve never been tested for insulin resistance. The signs were there. So I did what we all do and I quit eating sugar, rice, potatoes, bread. I walked more on top of my running mileage and only ate carbs before exercise. I ate tons of fiber. I made DRASTIC changes. 

Then my A1C was still 5.8. 

So I got a continuous glucose monitor. I made MORE changes. My white HUSBAND‚Äôs A1C went down two points because of MY changes üòÇ he still eats sugar coffee and tons of ice cream and honey sandwiches but my meal prep still made him healthier. My CGM says my average 30 day glucose is 98. 

My A1C yesterday IS STILL 5.8. That literally does not match my CGM. 

The only explanation to me is that I‚Äôm Asian and my blood gets glycated easier than my white husband.

""""  
The man stood, motionless at the door. A silently grey figure, the rain pattering around him, trickling down his neck. The figure reached one pale, spidery hand into his coat pocket and drew out a battered key. With a sigh he slotted it into the lock and opened the door with a piteous creak.

The state of the house showed that visitors were not commonplace. The house was dark and seemingly deserted, the shelves were dusty and a pile of unopened post lay at the door. The figure put down his briefcase and hung his coat on the empty coat hook. Kicking his shoes off and leaving them lying in the middle of the floor he . The faded wallpaper and dusty picture frames seemed to echo a happier time. Glancing down, the figure noticed something under the table. Reaching down, he picked it up. It was a little plastic car. As the man held it, smiling weakly, the ghost of a laugh seemed to echo around the room. The man pocketed it as a lump started to rise in his throat.

Shaking himself slightly, the man shuffled into the kitchen to make himself a coffee. As the water boiled, he caught a glance of himself in the darkened window; his face was young, though prematurely lined and his hair was dotted with grey. He rubbed one hand over his unshaven chin. He didn‚Äôt really care about it, he was past caring.

He looked aimlessly around; the empty walls bore square silhouettes, ghosts of pictures and memories too painful to be reminded of. Joyful smiles danced tantalizingly in front of his eyes, just out of reach but ever haunting him.

The whistling of the kettle dragged him out of his reverie, he sluggishly opened the chipped wooden cabinet and drew out a mug. As he sipped his drink, his eyes fell on a bottle lying discarded in the sink, wine pooling around the rim. Sighing, he put his drink down with a dull thud. He picked up the bottle, it was nearly empty, yet the cork lay there on the counter, still attached to the corkscrew. Where had she got it? He thought he took all the alcohol away; she must have had a secret stash somewhere.

She had been drinking ever since it had happened. Trying to numb her pain and ignore the world around her. Once, she had been so full of life and joy, an infective personality who made friends everywhere she went.

Once. ¬†¬†

Now she was a husk, a spectre, wandering aimlessly among the shattered dreams in an empty house. She was unrecognizable, as was he. Or so people said. Life had grown dull. It was as though he was living every day on autopilot. Not alive, simply... living. And yet he knew he had to continue, for her sake. Only his love for her prevented him from succumbing as she did but she was slipping away.

He knew where she was, she was always there though he pretended not to notice. The man turned around, leaving his steaming mug behind. He trudged to the front door and drew out a black umbrella, still speckled with raindrops.

The back garden was similarly neglected though showed lingering traces of having once been carefully tended. The grass was overgrown and patchy, the hedges untamed and the plants choked by weeds. Flowers arranged in neat rows were wilting and unpicked apples rotted on the ground. The garden was not large, hardly more than a square of dirt with a dirty shed in one corner and an old apple tree in the other.

He used to love that tree. They used to climb it together, the man would need to help him reach the branches because he couldn‚Äôt reach them. At this thought he was overcome by an insane desire to laugh.

But the urge quickly passed as the man spotted the figure lying huddled, like a child, under the tree. She was shivering, sobbing and muttering incoherently. In that moment, his heart truly broke.

Still wearing his suit, though somehow unaware, he knelt next to her in the mud. He took her and embraced her, clinging on, never letting go. He choked, unable to speak, to comfort her. For what comfort could be given?

Their son was gone. They would never again see his smile or hear his laugh. His toys would lie discarded and gathering dust forever. All they could do was to endure and hope things got better, that the pain dulled.

‚ÄúCome on‚Äù the figure spoke in a deep, hoarse voice ‚ÄúLet's get out of the rain‚Äù. He raised her up and pulled her under the umbrella, the rain drumming around them. As they left the tree behind them, a single leaf floating to the ground.

So, my job search hasn‚Äôt been going great lately, and I thought setting up some coffee chats could help me make connections and maybe get some resume advice. But wow, this was another disaster‚Ä¶ My second in-person coffee chat, and it just went south. Feeling a bit unlucky these days.

I met this Vietnamese guy on Hinge, and he seemed really nice. We agreed to meet near his office for a coffee chat. Everything started off fine; he was super friendly, and we chatted about work and stuff. Then he offered to look over my resume and give me some pointers, which I thought was awesome‚Ä¶ until it wasn‚Äôt.

So there‚Äôs this one part in my resume about ‚Äú5000 research data‚Äù that, to be honest, I didn‚Äôt actually do. It was kind of ‚Äúpolished up‚Äù by someone who helped me with my resume. Well, he noticed it and asked where exactly this data came from, and I just blanked‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt answer. Then he got suspicious and asked if I‚Äôd actually done that project, and I didn‚Äôt know what to say. He seemed pretty annoyed, said if I hadn‚Äôt really done it, I should‚Äôve been upfront about it. Then he just stopped going through my resume, said a few polite words, and left.

Looking back, I feel so dumb. That‚Äôs twice now that an in-person coffee chat has totally backfired on me. Am I doing something wrong here? Anyone have tips on things to avoid talking about or how to keep it from getting awkward? I feel like I keep hitting these invisible landmines, and I could really use some advice.",0,1730549619.0,unimelb,7,0.5,False

These places spread quickly, and somehow attract lots of hipsters. I find it an interesting social phenomenon. One opened next door, literally same morning people with laptops somehow knew it's there in seconds after opening and now I see them all the time. I hear they have cheap coffee - 5 meters next is a local business hold by a family, with amazing pastries and good and cheap coffee (saying it as someone with years of experience in specialty coffee). Why is this place so popular? No offense, just have been hearing same question from different people for months and thought may be someone can explainüòÇ",0,1730549567.0,berlin,19,0.3,False
1ghv1c7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perimenopause/comments/1ghv1c7/post_covid_anxiety/,Post Covid Anxiety ,"A few years ago, I started getting panic attacks out of nowhere and it was terrifying. It was my first symptom of Peri I now realize. 

My anxiety has been under control for the last 2 years. It creeps in during PMS week, but I manage it pretty well now because I know it will pass.  

Last week I got what I initially thought was food poisoning. I wasn‚Äôt throwing up, just stomach pain, bloating and nausea with no appetite. 

Then suddenly I developed a full body rash on the third day. My weird immune system gives me a rash anytime I get a virus ( it‚Äôs called a viral exthanthem) so I decided I should test for Covid. It was the faintest positive & I was shocked. I had Covid before & it was all respiratory symptoms. This time, I had no respiratory symptoms whatsoever. 

The week before Covid I was drinking 2 cups of coffee every morning with absolutely no anxiety whatsoever. Now, if I even try to have a sip, my body goes into full panic mode. It‚Äôs so weird & feels like I‚Äôm shaking internally, my jaw tenses up & I feel like I‚Äôm going to pass out. It was so bad yesterday I almost went to the ER. This morning I made a pot of half decaf and it happened again after just a few sips. The other weird thing is any time I eat or drink anything at all, my stomach blows up instantly & I look pregnant.  I could deal with the stomach stuff, but the anxiety is terrifying & I was doing amazing before getting sick. 

Has anyone else had post Covid anxiety? And if so, did it get better with time? I‚Äôm scared because it took so long to get my anxiety under control. It‚Äôs also weird because it is strictly in my body, not really in my brain (if that makes sense). I know there is a strong mind/gut connection and it does feel like it‚Äôs connected to the gut.
