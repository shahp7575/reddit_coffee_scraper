It had some bug damage in the middle of the slab and I’m not a huge fan of epoxy so I am trying inlays out.

I also don’t have a vacuum press.

I thought about just putting something heavy on the inlay only but I’m not sure if that’s a bad idea or even how much weight is really needed. I see large numbers on all the clamps but can’t imagine I really need hundreds of pounds for an unstressed joint that fits very well. Open to ideas!",1,1764130697.0,woodworking,1,1.0,False

I am a 31 year old man. I work in tech as a Devops engineer in Bangalore. I'm looking for someone based in Bangalore, with whom I can be friends with first and then if we vibe, turn it to a long term relationship. 

I'm 5'11"", well built, active with workouts and play badminton. I look younger than my age. I love football, traveling and also trying my hand with cooking. 
I'm a non-vegetarian and I'm originally from Kerala. I don't have any restrictions on where you are actually from as long as you match what I'm looking for and live in Bangalore. 

My type of woman is someone who is emotionally intelligent, chatty, empathetic and can communicate well.
Prefer someone who is working, and can manage their own expenses. It doesn't mean you won't receive the occasional surprises but I want to ensure that you are someone who is financially stable enough to survive on your own. Also I prefer someone who is into fitness, if not already, then plan to be. We could be workout partners and hype each other up and grow together :) 

We could go out together, try out different variety of food, taste coffee, watch movies, travel to different places, and try out new things and experiences. 

I could say a lot of fancy things to attract you, but I would rather not do that and over commit giving you false hope. I would rather build a relationship with a strong foundation based on understanding and the person who you are. Loyalty and trust is important to me. 

If you feel like this interests you and matches the person who you are, feel free to reach out over DM with an introduction about yourself. 

P.S: Please don’t reach out if you already have a partner or looking for free therapy. Thank you!",1,1764130173.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

1p6xzmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lyme/comments/1p6xzmo/what_is_this_monster_inside_me/,WHAT IS THIS MONSTER INSIDE ME?,"I test positive for bart bab Lyme and mycoplasma. ALWAYS. Testing comes back positive with no issue. But I am nearly convinced the pathogens seen in my samples must look like something that has not been discovered. I get lost in thought at all the time that if I was a kardahsian, for example, I could have a team working on me to get to the bottom of this nightmare.

it all started mid 20s. 33 now. no tick bite. Always a healthy child / teen . Had the best college years. Then one day it changed. LEGITIMATELY OVERNIGHT. Nothing led up to it. I was at my office job and one side of my head went numb. I ran to the bathroom and felt so dizzy. I spent the entire summer in and out of the ER being told “girls in their 20s develop migraines” I was pumped with migraine meds. Did so many MRIs. tried so many migraine meds. NOTHING touched the pain. I was convinced I had a brain tumor.

Months later I went to a chiropractor who said it sounds like Lyme. I got on doxy and the headaches went away. I thought it was behind me.

a few months later I took a trip to Florida. I was fine besides the fact I kept getting UTI symptoms for months. I would try different UTI meds and nothing touched it. I went to 20+ gynos, urologists, etc. I even traveled out of state to a “top UTI doc” and you guessed it…nothing touched the pain! Now instead of brain scans I was getting pelvic / bladder/vaginal scans…nothing found!

an unfortunate lightbulb went off that HEY MAYBE this is Lyme. but I was uneducated and had no clue the journey that was up ahead. This went on for YEARS. The disease sat in my pelvis / bladder area. Everyday was a different nightmare but it was BIZARRE in how it showcased. Never urgency or frequency. just moving pain from an ovary to my bladder and back. feeling like there was acid in my bladder. A sensation like something was hanging on top of my bladder(I can’t even explain) lots of nerve pain vaginally. And it would change daily. it ruined my sex life. I was in so much pain…FOR YEARS. Doctors were clueless and even the initial Lyme docs I saw…stumped. Cause I was completely fine other than the bladder / pelvic pain. (at this time I tried every single UTI medication known to man, every herb for bladder issues, so many docs / naturopaths etc. and nothing worked)

After getting no help I started seeing LLMDS. I tried herbs , homeopathics , short term antibiotics , ozone , red light , sauna , vitamin IVS and I already know I am forgetting a billion things… I have been relentless trying to get my life back and a key thing here is NO MATTER THE TREATMENT I DO NOT HERXZ.

Most recently I did homeopathy and anti parasitics. I had a crazy episode this summer where everything went numb for a few seconds from the next down. I also had another episde where it felt like I was looking through a tunnel. like my vision felt like it could only see through the middle of my eye. (at this time I was on herbs short term that had Kava in it and believe that may of caused a reaction but doubt it)

I am currently focused on bee venom therapy with 2.5 months under my belt , though it’s seemingly 50/50 if it works for Bart , and I believe that is my worst infection. Though I did do a microscope blood analysis this summer and the doc said Babesia is my worst infection which is news to me.

My symptoms align with nearly no one. For example, if my eyes hurt my other issues “subside” but if my eyes don’t hurt as bad other parts of my body get effected. this monster inside of me makes home in one area at a time then moves. It feels way to “alive” in my case to just be inflammation.

My eye symptoms are wildly UNMATCHED. They get so dry and burn. my water line will tingle. The inner corners get bothered. I get shooting nerve pain in the eye. It feels like the eye sockets are numb. It’s crazy and changes constantly. it’s been like this for months. Precious to this the infection sat dead center in my chest. It took me to the ER. Nothing was found. It felt like an elephant hanging dead center for MONTHS. When I would eat it would feel like the food would get stuck there. I did every heart test imaginable. I believe it was the esophagus / vagus nerve being attacked. Regardless it was insane.

i deal with a lot of one sided weakness. tounge feels too big for mouth. PVCS. Nerve pain in NOSE. ear pain. Ears get extremely clogged at random. It’s scary. areas of my toes feel numb. I feel like recently I am having circulatory issues. Like when I sit for a while my calfs get tight. So many weird skin issues on my body.

I get nerve pain in my teeth for seconds at a time. Leg pain. AND A billion more symptoms.

i don’t flare. I get no break. It rotates around my body daily.

so many people “just have” neck pain , back pain , fatigue etc. and it’s Lyme but those symptoms I would KILL FOR.

and what’s scary is so far nothing I’ve tried works or touches my issues. doctors are clueless. Hence me doing bee venom solo and again I herx from nothing so I never know if I’m on the right track. Things got worse last year after I started experimenting with iver-mectin and colloidal silver by the cup. I took NO vaccines. this time last year I cut off caffeine and haven’t touched coffee since. i cook mainly all my meals at home. I moved out of mold this past summer and took nothing. I started all over.

this isn’t even half my story.

How do I know this? Because I am an unrepentant shill for my corporate cannabis overlords.

Actually, I don't work for them myself, but I am connected pretty close with corporate bigwigs who are right now, at this very minute, desperately trying to figure out what the hell they are doing wrong that is about to get them canned by the board.

So, this is your opportunity to tell me what they are doing wrong. Sure, if you are feeling good about them, you can toss in what they are doing right, but really, this is a way you can have an effect on the outcome of changes about to be made.

What do they need to change? What is the worst thing about Curaleaf? What do they need to do to get your business?

Seriously, I don't want to hear abiut that moldy skunk you got that one time, or the snotty attitude of the budtender who thought she was all that and a bad of shake, okay? I want to hear about the major issues that have kept you from going to Curaleaf dispensaries in the past, and I want to know what needs to be changed to get you in there and get you stoned on some Curaleaf flower.

I promise, this is going to get injected right into the top of the top, not quite high enough that Boris will choke on his morning coffee, but certainly the people that talk to Boris will be seeing this.

If you want to tell them to get stuffed, here is your chance, I just want details about *why* they should get stuffed.

1p6xrti,https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/1p6xrti/type_me/,Type me,"This may sound insane, but I've typed as seven types before. Every single type I've received on the countless of tests I've taken (16personalities, sakinorva, humanmetrics, IDRLabs, mistype investigator, michael caloz, keys2cognition, you name it...) has matched me in some way, and it's hard for me to tell which one I prefer more. I usually recieve high scores on both ends of the cognitive functions (high Ne and Ni, Fe and Fi, Te and Ti), so it doesn't really make sense either. I've also read into most of these functions and feel confident about having them, until I read the other side and resonate with that as well. (I strongly resonate with the Ne-Si axis, but no more than how much I resonate with the Ni-Se axis).

I'm pretty much unsure about which type I am, and I only know a few prominent traits about me, so I'll put them here:  
1) I am a creative person. I love music, I love dancing, singing, etc. Without it, I wouldn't be me. I collect vinyl records and play piano/guitar. I love broadway musicals and my dream is to watch Chicago or Hamilton one day. When trying to get into music, it often takes a few listens to get used to it and like it, but I must like it to some extent on the first listen and be intrigued for me to even want to like it.  I cry easily and I get passionate about the things I like. 

2) I typically have an image of how some things are in my mind, but I take other people's advice seriously, so when they tell me one piece of information, I either completely ignore the information and continue following what I believe (ahem, basically how I've been approaching my MBTI type), or sometimes even destroy the entire framework I've created, panic, and start from scratch. There's no time where I've just integrated part of it easily, it takes me much longer to do that.

3) I am a very indecisive person, it will take me very long to make a decision, and I am someone who just gets nervous in fast paced environments and hates being rushed while doing things. It stresses me out easily and I will panic or cry. When I get stressed out, I'll eat horribly, I won't eat enough because I'll only be eating sweets and unhealthy, which can lead to me feeling gross and losing weight. Physical stuff sometimes bothers me, like putting on makeup or trying to fit in with trends. I hate rollercoasters, they are way too overstimulating for me physically, and the one thing holding me back from going on them is the fear of passing out due to overexposure to such strong g forces.

4) I suffer from FOMO a lot of the time, especially in trios. I have been in two trio friend groups in my life, and one ended up with a very messy break up, and another one is still going, but I have a lot of anxiety and jealousy when I hang out with them. I don't so much as get FOMO when it doesn't directly involve me, like one of my friends having fun or partying or hanging out when I have no idea who she's with. It's more like, if two of my friends in my trio are so much as calling or even texting eachother, I'll get mad for no reason.

5) Jealousy is my worst enemy, which is why I like to isolate myself from people who have more opportunities and a better life than me so I don't feel that. If that's unavoidable, I'll just constantly point out the other person's flaws to myself to make me feel better (it's very toxic, I know, I'm trying to fix it). I act like I'm fine around people, cause my jealousy is usually deeper and stronger. This sounds insane, but in my low points, I won’t even be able to watch a show or read a book normally without being jealous of every character having more opportunities and better lives than me.

6) I oftentimes come back to my comfort shows and stuff, I like to go to my favorite coffee shop; I'm unafraid to try new things, but once I try something new and I like it, it will become permanent part of my life. And vice versa, if I try something new and I hate it or I start to slowly hate it, I'll cut it out entirely. But I love to rewatch my favorite shows over and over again. However, it's easy for me to get accustomed to new environments physically (like the campus of a new school or the building of a new job).

7) I am sort of a leader, since I am the oldest sibling/oldest grandchild in my family. I may like to lead people, but I am in no way bossy or haughty, I just like to keep things in order and make sure everything's running smoothly. Whenever I'm in a group for a project, I am almost all of the time the person who organizes everything, makes sure everything is submitted on time and makes sure everyone does their part. But internally, I am not organized like this at all. I tried so many different Todo list applications and it's nearly impossible for me to be consistent with them.

8) I am a very religious person, and do believe in monotheism. However, I would be much more likely to use an ointment or medicine if it's prescribed from an actual doctor, rather than just a herbal tea or lotion. I believe in proven facts much more than things that are empirical

9) I am quick to anger with people who are close to me, and I get irritated quickly when people are doing things incorrectly or being manipulative. I can easily sense when someone is fake or lying to me, and I hate it a lot. I, myself, hate lying to appease people, and when someone does that, I get mad. But when they are surface level friends or people I've just met, I don't really shy away from sugar coating the truth to get their approval.

10) I sort of feel uncomfortable without knowing what the future has in store for me, but I also feel uncomfortable making decisions too early. Ie: going to medical school is a possibility for me, but I have a month or so to decide whether I am going to take or opt out of the course I need for the class, and it can either save me money but also keep me from even applying to med school or can cost me money and can be a waste if I don't do anything). It's usually best for me to make decisions earlier, but only if those decisions are able to be changed up until the last second. I usually won't change my mind, but that cushion just makes me feel a bit more comfortable.

11) I am introverted, I feel comfortable being on my own and just enjoying my own company.   

Also, I won't really know myself or my behavior when I'm not comparing myself to others, ie. when I'm with my chill cousin, i feel talky and neurotic, and when I'm with my friend who has diagnosed ADHD, I feel like a super chill istp type of person. When evaluating just myself, neither end of the spectrum really sticks out to me.

I'm 22(M) and enjoy music, video games (Switch 2 and PS5), board games, cooking, politics, coffee, going out to eat, reality competitions (i.e. Survivor), comedy shows, Harry Potter, Nintendo, theme parks, etc.

I would like to have this be somewhere to make new connections/friends and possibly meet up. The group would be inclusive of everyone regardless of their race, sex, orientation, political beliefs, etc.

I'd like to start a group chat on Instagram. DM or comment if interested and tell me a little about you!",1,1764129275.0,LongIslandFriends,0,1.0,False

The vendor auto collected every single one without a single question. We only realized what happened when the intern asked why the outstanding balance wasn’t going down. I don’t think he meant any harm, but this was literally the one task he had and we just burned like $2k because nobody caught it. Leadership is leaning toward letting him go and while I do understand just a bit of their pov, I still don't agree with letting him off since this is a 100% fuck up of our system as a whole. Yes he did a mistake but this can easily happen with the next intern that we would get instead of him. I'm thinking of telling this to them but I'm not sure if I should do it (I'm a dev not an accountant)

1p6xnqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/1p6xnqd/newly_homeless_need_advice/,Newly homeless. Need Advice.,"New to the area and out on the street. I hate to air out personal details and don't want this to seem like a sob story but context is important. As of late, life really has felt worse than the scenes from Falling Down. Every time I keep thinking things couldn't possibly get any worse, they do. It's a lengthy read, so strap in, and thank you if you even read through it all diagonally.

Read on if interested. The TLDR is at the very bottom.

39yo male with HFA and ADHD, though I regularly pass for normal/neurotypical in all but the most demanding social situations. 

No criminal history. No addictions. No kids. No money. No car. And, more recently, no home. No phone; cell only has access wi-fi or 911 calls. And, as you have probably guessed, no idea what to do.

I relocated here from Kansas in late April after many tragedies happened in quick succession. Cats died. Then mother got ill and died from cancer at the beginning if the year. I was their caregiver and proxy in the years prior, as they were a kidney transplant recipient with autoimmune disorders. Before then, they had bouts of severe illness due to complications stemming from lupus. 

During these more recent years, I had been working with 501c3 nonprofits and a no-kill shelter to get the neighborhood colony TNRed and/or rehomed while catching and fostering kittens from a feral cat. When three of my own cats died over the course of a few months, I was unprepared for the grief but had the colony responsibilities to distract from it. Soon thereafter, the parent was admitted into hospital and died in hospice less than two weeks later. 

To his credit, my estranged half-brother welcomed me into his house afterwards, but against the wishes of his wife, a detail he omitted, all the while knowing that an aunt was more than willing to have me stay with her as a guest. Long enough to get situated. Despite the aunt having allergies, she offered that I could bring 1-2 of my cats along with. My brother then made the same offer, only to renege later, requiring that I drop the cats off at the shelter on short notice. His first reason for this was the landlord said no, but he would have known that from the lease. Nevertheless, I found a workaround thanks to diagnoses, allowing an emotional support animal to be on the premises. At this point, the true underlying reason was given, which was cat hair. Their own dog was chosen specifically because the breed didn't shed. 

In the time since then, the aunt no longer has an available room to let me stay, because she took in another family member. So that option is off the table.

The change of residence meant having to adopt out as many of the indoor cats as possible beforehand. Thankfully, there were enough options and the no-kill shelter stepped up, but that was another jarring event I can't fully accept. Losing family. 

My brother found it amusing, almost embarrassing by association that I care about them so much. This was a red flag, but at that point I was already moved in with no alternatives, no say.

Had my half-brother been forthcoming, I would have kept a few of the cats and moved in temporarily with the aunt, who admitted she was in need of an extra hand around her place with her physical condition not being the greatest. Win/win situation. If only.

But my half-brother kept a lot of info to himself, as I came to learn.

Not wanting to overstay my welcome, I updated the location of an old dating app profile, just in case. The idea being, 100% Costanza transparency about my situation. What could it hurt? Lo and behold, a very intelligent, personable, and pretty woman sends a like. We match and hit it off online. I make her laugh and she suggests we meet up in person, halfway, at a coffee shop, restaurant or whatever. 

I do some research, finding the perfect place and she agrees to meet there. I tell my brother, who gestures for the phone and gives her profile a once-over, disapproving of certain details. I tell him, if he wants, he can introduce himself and do me the favor of giving a ride, only 10 minutes away instead of the hours-long walk it would otherwise take. If the time is no good, I'll reschedule, I tell him. He agrees and I confirm the date. The day arrives and the time comes and goes, my brother nowhere to be found. I apologize to the date ASAP and ask if we can try again, any day she prefers. She agrees and is very understanding. I get ahold of my brother and tell him, if he doesn't think he can offer a lift, I'll figure it out on my own, no worries. He reassures me it's fine. The day comes, the time passes, and he is not home. Again, I apologize to the would-be date and tell her she ought to be late next time, or a no-show, so we're even. She laughs at the idea and agrees to a third supposed date. Wouldn't you know it, the brother does not pull into the driveway until an hour after the fact. He insists he'll still drive me, but by now the potential date has understandably given up, already in pajamas and no chance of being coaxed into another brokeunmatched.

The following day she unmatches. That night, I leave the house unannounced, but in line of sight if my brother. I walk all the way to the place where the date was supposed to be and then back. It took hours but I did it, just to prove I could just to keep the promise, however late, however unrewarded. The morning after, my brother was beside himself, almost impressed, whereas his wife was anything but. 

The folliwing night I accused him of sabotaging the potential relationship, he yelled and insisted I calm down. I yelled back. Then he yelled. We stopped ourselves from escalating and began to talk. But the wife jumped at the opportunity, inserting herself into the conversation. According to her. I was in the wrong for being out beyond a curfew that was never established. She was mad that the door had to be left unlocked for me, even though they lived in a gated community with no crime and a security system and a small yippy dog. 

To his credit, my brother acknowledged that he failed to be there, to do what he said. And yet when he apologized, his wife told him not to apologize. When he tried to compromise, she began to insult. By then, I had already stated that I needed to leave. That family was not family without love and love was not love without respect. 

As I packed what few belongings I had, the wife was not satisfied and threatened to take the kids to a hotel, unless I left immediately. Coming from a broken home, I didn't want that to become a reality for their children, with me being used as the reason. So I left in a hurry, in the middle of the night, $90 to my name.

Where's he gonna go, my brother asked. To which his wife replied, I don't care. Thankfully, the nearest hotel dud not accept the plasma donor debit card, otherwise all of my money would have been spent. I believed, stupidly, that things would be resolved the next day, or the day after. No such luck.

Eventually, I reconnected with my brother when he went jogging but there was so little time to discuss matters and try to problem solve.

The wife would track his movements via phone app and call him if she suspected anything. And, before long, she became verbally abusive towards him, threatening divorce and a custody battle if he continued to provide any assistance at all, which included the occasional MRE and partial transportation to recruiters. She claimed that I had been taking advantage of him but, even before I arrived, I insisted that be made a tenant, paying back rent after enlisting into the Army which, by most accounts, would be the fastest option. But my brother dismissed tye offer, saying there was no hurry. The Air Force was the best option, according to him, even though the process would take longer. 

So in the meantime I put in job applications with no responses. I ate minimally. I took limited showers. I declined going along with them for vacation trips, mentioning my diagnoses and lingering grief. But eventually I relented in one case, a local hotspot, not wanting to be rude. This resulted in being overstimulated and needing to destress, to regain energy levels, which they did not understand.

Still, months passed without incident. No job offers came, but I did what was asked, removing weeds from the backyard, trimming the bushes, and mowing the front lawn regularly. I did the dishes and changed out the dehumidifier as well, asking for additional work to earn my keep. And during the summer months, I escorted my niece from school as requested. 

Fastforward to a month ago, sleep-deprived and having lost 15lbs. Where initially I had been average height/weight, according to recruiters, the change was still within the accepted range, just barely.

Weeks pass and I somehow managed to score very high on the PiCat. Then I matched the same questions/answers at the follow-up test, to prove no cheating had occurred. All of this only to be denied at MEPS due to decades-old diagnoses being in their system. 

These same diagnoses do not qualify me for disability and yet I am disallowed from military service despite proving to be capable and not a liability. This contradiction is frustrating to say the least. 

Mind you, I have no criminal history, as confirmed recently by the military's FBI background check, and yet also have no work history or job prospects/callbacks. 

Despite having been living outdoors, I'm reluctant to enter the shelter given the distance to get there on foot, along with some of the negative reviews. Because I haven't been in SA for a year, I won't have access to much-needed facilities. By all accounts, I would still be outside. So the negatives seem to outweigh the positives, though I could be wrong. 

The hope was to be enlisted already, but even that would have required a several months waiting period before shipping out. There are still other military branches to try for, but the diagnoses will need to be invalidated first and soon, since I'm already on the cusp of aging out. 

If this all sounds exhausting, it is. Memories of my cats have kept me going, along with the simplest things. Creamy peanut butter on sliced bread. Biryani that an Uber driver delivered to a non-adress, somehow left there throughout a chilly night, twelve hours untouched. So thank you, delivery driver, emphatically. Your mistake was a small miracle for me, unable to find the rightful person, though I didn't put a great deal.of effort in that. It was easily the best meal I've ever had and one I hope to try again, if/when I get through this ordeal.

So some silver-lining to speak of. 

There have also been two apparent strays, orange cats, that show themselves occasionally on my walks. About a month ago, I found a gourmet bag of cat food, presumably left by a previous owner? So I took to feeding both cats at their separate locations which gave me, and them, something to look forward to. They still won't let me get close, but they are noticeably appreciative.

For myself, I have managed to get food on occasion from area church pantries but initially went without food or water on and off, the longest period being six days when temperatures were high. My body is still recovering from that.

Big as it is, Texas does not accomodate for walking, but I've had no other options, once even rucking 7 1/2 hours in an attempt to receive services. Never again.

I haven't bathed in nearly a month and the month before that only once thanks to the hotel provided before MEPS. I am aware that certain churches do make showers available, but the walk to and from those locations is too far, especially on an empty stomach while sleep-deprived.

That said, thanks to a nearby church pantry, I was given a $20 gift card. With that, I was able to get very basics, along with a cheapo can-opener to open canned goods I had been cracking and scraping open with rocks. Yes, it's been that rough. 

My electric trimmer just ran out of power and the brother failed to get the plug/cord for it. The timer is ticking before I have that viking look. In that case. All the more difficult to land a job.

So the $20 from last week went fast, but I managed to afford a $3 bag of cat food for the two orange cats and shared a can of tuna because skipjack was the favorite treat of my own cats. Another thanks, this time to the anonymous person who has been leaving cans of wet food out along the fence for one of the orange cats who lurks around that parking lot at night. Knowing they're being cared for is a relief.

Thanksgiving is approaching of course and the word family has been redefined personally. Family is whoever cares and recognizes that, with only a few turn of events, it could be them in the same situation. Thursday offers food and it will be closed then, given the holiday. The same goes for other pantries that are within walking distance, approx 3-5 miles. Downtown is too far. I did it once and had blisters that remained until MEPS.

Further complicating matters, at the end of the month my brother is moving to a nicer house somewhere in SA and has shown little-to-no interest in helping. I've since severed ties, giving something of an ultimatum. But a week has passed and I don't expect any reply. 

I'm trying to limit distances traveled when food is scarce, but libraries have been a mainstay/godsend, if for no other reason than the free wi-fi and bathroom sink to keep clean or at least maintain a relatively presentable appearance. Even so, certain vehicles here are excessively loud by design, wearing my sensitivities thin. 

It's now been over a year since the last cat died, slowly and painfully. A death that was avoidable. 

While still at my brother's, he would take us to a plasma center. The workers never were able to get anything out of me. Small, flat veins, the women would complain. But still, I would get paid as usual. Though it would later add to the household conflict, I used some of my plasma donor money to pay back the nonprofit fund, people covered the $300 bill in an effort to save the cat's life, no questions asked. Misdiagnosed with asthma, so much time had passed already to undo the effects of what turned out to be pneumonia, that the little tuxedo cat passed away not long after. Even though all efforts to save the cat's life had failed, it meant everything that the nonprofit covered the bill.

That said, if my mother had listened when I first noticed issues with the cat, if she had accepted assistance from her sister, the dependable aunt, it would have cost $100 for the vet visit. And the little cat would have lived. Instead, my mother contacted social sevices to have me investigated for elder abuse because of those requests and because I had been encouraging her every day to get back contact with the only surgeon in the state available to perform the life-saving surgery. The investigation was discontinued thanks to the aunt who convinced her sister otherwise.

I've worked often enough but, in keeping with AuDhD statistic, rarely earned wages as a result. Mostly volunteer work and internships with three years of college which had to be discontinued after taking out of state tuition to cover rent so my mother could focus on the transplant and recovery. The arrangement was that the excess loan amount would be paid by her, once healthy, but that never happened.

Now the weather's getting colder, wetter. The mat I had been sleeping on is muddied. Same goes for the one thin blanket, which wasn't helping much to begin with. 

The takeaway here, for me, is to question who really is family and love those who truly are, whatever form that takes. Every day is invaluable, more important than any holiday once that member is gone.

TLDR

2024 and now 2025 have been the worst. Family member overpromised and underdelivered, now washing their hands of the situation. I am living, or at least existing, one day at a time out in the elements with little in the way of food.  I want to get back to my home state, the small town I was in previously which has a less daunting/more inviting shelter. From there I might even be able to look after the cat colony, as I had been, what with winter on its way. But I have no means of getting back there.

I am at a loss. Any ideas or advice is appreciated. Even a ride there, assuming anyone is headed up that way. Thank you.",1,1764129040.0,sanantonio,1,0.57,False

I’m not sure if this is the right place to post, so apologies in advance if it isn’t.

Someone close to me went through a very traumatic legal situation. He was arrested about 10 years ago and then spent 6 years on bail. During that time, he was repeatedly harassed, and his trial dates were cancelled last minute over and over again. He spent over $300,000 on legal fees, and by the end, he could no longer afford to proceed to trial.

There was never any direct evidence against him. The case was built entirely on circumstantial claims – mainly that meeting someone for “lunch” or “coffee” somehow implied drug activity. He was followed, his home and cars were monitored, and he was intercepted for about 15 months. The original investigation was actually focused on someone else, but because he had casual contact with that person, he and several others were dragged into it. Despite all the surveillance, they never found drugs on him, in his home, in his car, or in his possession at any time.

One police officer in particular seemed to take a very personal interest in him. After all those years on bail, his lawyers – who had always said he could beat the case at trial – suddenly changed direction and told him he had until 5pm that same day (after calling him around 11am) to decide whether to plead guilty. They told him that if he didn’t plead, he would face 13 years. Unless you’ve lived through years of stress, financial ruin, and fear, it’s easy to say “why would anyone plead guilty?” But people trust their lawyers, and he truly believed he had no choice.

He ended up pleading guilty, even though they had no evidence of drug quantities or frequency. Despite that, he received 9 years. Ironically, the person he was supposedly a “customer” of only got 6. On the day of sentencing, the same police officer with the personal vendetta attended in plain clothes and sat in the gallery. Is that normal?

He has recently been released from prison, but this week that same officer contacted his estranged father in New Zealand asking for his phone number and email address. Given that he has completed his sentence, why would this be happening? His father provided the details, and now he feels anxious and like this ordeal will never end.

Does anyone know why an officer would be reaching out after the sentence is fully served, and what options or rights we have here? Thank you, and sorry — it’s very hard to summarise such a long and painful experience.

1p6xnfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p6xnfj/if_a_stranger_offers_to_pay_your_dinner_bill_be/,"If a stranger offers to pay your dinner bill, be careful when you leave your table…","I’m a server at a midwestern diner. A few weeks ago, a customer appeared at one of the booths. I say “appeared” because I hadn’t seen her come in, and usually I am very attentive to the sound of the doorbell. It *was* a pretty bustling evening though.

I approached to take her order.

She sat with her back to me, her curly hair pinned up in a style that reminded me of old movies. Her age was hard to determine from behind but she looked to be in her sixties, I guess? She was sitting perfectly still.

Statuesque.

When I came around to the front of the booth, I gasped and dropped my pen.

The woman was not breathing.

Lips slightly parted. Skin withered and shrunken. No movement. Not the faintest motion of her chest.

But it was the eyes that were the giveaway she was dead. Unblinking and unseeing and a little too deeply shrunken in their sockets.

“Oh God—” I took a step back.

And then the woman’s head turned and she said in a raspy voice: “Just a coffee please.” Her eyes blinked. Not dead after all.

“O-of course! Sure. Um, any milk or sugar—”

“Black.”

I scurried to get her coffee. When I looked back, she was again motionless. When it came time for the check she put down a fifty-dollar bill. I started to tell her I didn’t have change since all she’d ordered was a coffee but she said, “It’s all right, dear. It will cover the meal for that nice family over there.” Her head inclined, ever so slightly, to a family in the corner booth having dinner.

The family in the corner were regulars. Came here every Sunday with the kids. The parents were divorced. The kids lived with their dad, and their mom always picked them up on weekends. This diner was on the route between the parents’ houses, and they’d meet up here to discuss the plans for the next week. They always left a tip and the kids drew pictures for me.

“Really?” I said to the old woman. “That’s very nice of you.”

Without another word the old woman stood up and left.

The family were very pleasantly surprised when I approached and informed them that their meal had been paid for. They asked by who, and I told them the old woman from the other booth. One of the kids looked over where I’d indicated and said, “I didn’t see any woman sitting there.”

Weird.

The next time the old woman appeared was several weeks later.

It was after midnight.

Again, I heard no bell ring above the door.

I was wiping down the counters and when I looked up there she was, sitting at the same booth. Like a statue. Silent.

I came over to take her order.

I wondered if I should ask her about the family. I hadn’t seen them in the weeks since she’d paid for their meal. It was strange. They’d been coming every Sunday, and then after she paid their meal, they stopped.

As I neared the booth, suddenly the woman inhaled. It struck me that until then she’d been so still I hadn’t been sure if she’d been breathing at all. She turned to me and said, “Coffee, please. Black.”

“Sure.”

Since she wasn’t exactly chatty, I just went and got her coffee, trying to work up the nerve to strike up a casual conversation and ask her about the family.

Before I could, the doorbell rang and Carlos came in. Carlos was a friend of my boss who liked to drop in once in awhile. He ordered a burger, and we began chatting about how things were with his girlfriend, and with his girlfriend’s boyfriend (I can never keep track of who’s in his astonishingly wide relationship circle). Apparently he’d just adopted a dog. He showed me pictures while he ate.

“Carlos, not to be mean, but… that might be the world’s fugliest dog,” I told him.

He laughed. “Nobody wanted her. That’s why I took her.”

“That’s sweet of you but that thing looks like it has rabies.”

“Scabies.”

“What?”

“I’m kidding. She’s got mange though.”

He started to tell me about how he’d rescued her when I heard a throat clear and remembered the woman at the booth—shoot, I’d forgotten her order! I hurried to get her coffee and as I set it down asked if she wanted anything else and she put a twenty down and said it was “for that nice young man’s burger.” She didn’t even drink the coffee I gave her. She got up and left, ignoring me when I started to ask, “Are you sure? Why do you keep paying for—""

“Hey!” called Carlos. “Who are you talking to?”

“The woman—” I turned back, but she was already gone.

“*What* woman? It’s just you and me. You OK? Are you high or something?”

I looked at the money in my hand. It was real enough.

“Burger’s on the house,” I told him.

“For real? Thanks!” He scarfed the last bite, hopped up and told me he was late (no idea what sort of date he was off to at 1am, but that’s Carlos). And then he was breezing out the door.

The next day, I heard he’d been shot.

My boss told me. We were chatting about the boss’s dog and I mentioned Carlos’s mangy rescue dog and he suddenly got serious and informed me that last night, Carlos had been jumped on his way to a bar. He’d tried to fight off the muggers, but one of them had a gun…

“They shot him in the head,” he said grimly.

“Jesus,” I said.

My boss told me Carlos had been rushed to the hospital. But he was hanging by a threat. Almost certain to die. Or if he survived, he’d be a vegetable.

I was shaken.

Deeply, deeply shaken.

Poor Carlos. His poor girlfriend. His poor, mangy dog.

And a thought intruded…

… was it because of the old woman?

What about the family that used to come in Sundays but had disappeared? Had misfortune struck *them,* too?

I resolved that the next time I saw the old woman, I would ask her what she was doing. I wouldn’t let her pay for the next customer.

The old woman returned just this afternoon.

There were only a handful of customers, as it was between the lunch and dinner hour. As always, I didn’t hear her come in. One moment I was busy busing dishes, the next I spotted her at the booth.

I straightened up and approached her.

Her sunken eyes turned to me. I could never get over the feeling I was looking at Death itself. Then she gave that sudden inhalation, like she was remembering to breathe, and she said, “Coffee. Black. And…”

I was surprised at the “and.”

“… a root beer float,” she added.

I just pressed my lips together, nodded and went to get the drinks. Surveyed the room. There were three other tables with customers. An old couple, a family with a teenaged daughter, a woman working on her laptop. And even though I should have gotten the old woman her drinks right away, I instead made sure to get everyone else’s orders to their tables *and* to get their bills to them. The couple paid, as did the woman on her laptop. That left only the family. They were still eating. I fetched the coffee and the float for the old woman but mentally resolved NOT to let her pay for anybody.

She did not react to my placing the drinks beside her.

I was tense, counting the minutes until the family was near to finishing.

The old woman cleared her throat.

Ignoring her, I hurried over to the family and asked if they wanted dessert. They didn’t, so I asked how they’d like to pay and quickly rang them up.

Only then did I return to the old woman’s booth.

She had not touched either drink.

She put a ten dollar bill on the table and said, “The root beer float is for you.”

“Oh,” I said, and goosebumps rose along my arms, because how did she know that root beer floats are my favorite? “No. I can’t have customers buy me drinks. It’s against policy.”

“I insist,” she said.

“I’ll bring you change for the coffee.”

She got up.

“Actually wait, here, I’ll pay for everything.” I quickly reached into my pocket for my wallet and dropped ten dollars onto the table. “I’ll get your coffee, too. On the house, since I took so long with your order.”

She frowned. “Accept the gift that is given to you.”

“Nope. I can pay for the root beer float even though I didn’t drink it. And your coffee is free.” And I took her ten dollars and, holding my breath, seized her papery hand and shoved the bill into her fingers.

She exhaled. And left.

I didn’t turn around as she walked past me. Didn’t hear the doorbell ring. But a moment later, when I looked over my shoulder, there was no trace of the old woman.

I feeling of relief swept over me.

A little while later, the dinner hour had arrived and the tables were full. I heard the doorbell ring and—it was them! My family of regulars! Today's not a Sunday, and I hadn't seen them in so long, so I was very surprised. I cleaned up their usual booth and got them seated, and when I came over to take their order I exclaimed about how I’d missed seeing them.

“Oh, yeah, it was pretty crazy,” said the dad. “After we left—last time, we drove together—and I don’t know if you remember how hard it was raining, but the car skidded and we lost control—”

“*You* lost control,” corrected the mom.

“—yes, *I* lost control, because it was the minivan that I told you not to get because those things flip way too easily. And it did. It rolled. I mean, it spun out right in the middle of the highway and then flipped over the guard rail and rolled.”

“I swear my soul left my body,” said one of the kids.

“… it was very harrowing. We just couldn’t come back here for awhile,” said the mom.

“Were you hurt?” I asked, stunned.

“Just minor injuries. The police said it was really just miraculous how we all came out of it alive.” The mom smiled.

I nodded, glad for them, relieved to have my regulars back again. They said they couldn't bring themselves to come for awhile because of the accident, but the kids kept asking so tonight they decided to meet here for dinner.

After I put in their order I called my boss to let him know, because he’d been worried about them, too. He sounded delighted on the phone, and told me he had some good news of his own: ""Carlos is gonna pull through! He’s awake from the coma, and he's now on the road to recovery!""

“That’s great!” I said, even as at that moment something clicked.

I typed all this up instead of leaving at the end of my shift tonight. I've been thinking about the old woman. How she looked… well, like Death. Or maybe, more like *near* death. I keep thinking about how Carlos took a bullet to the brain. How the family of regulars were in a horrific accident. How all of them should have been dead, but they survived by a miracle.

… And I think I may have made a terrible mistake…

So now, I’m terrified to leave the diner. Terrified because I didn’t let her pay for my drink.

Wife and I have been looking at the moccamaster for about a year now and with the sales going thinking about pulling the trigger. Current coffee setup is just a nespresso because my wife likes her iced coffee but sometimes I want just a drip coffee to drink a few cups on a weekend morning or pour a 16oz cup for my commute to work. We have a Ninja drip machine but it’s put away right now. I enjoy coffee but it’s not a must have daily for me. 

Looking at the KBGV currently but I’m so confused with all the posts on this page about the grind size and grams in and grams out. I was probably just going to get an OXO Conical Burr grinder to go along with the MM. Saw someone recommend the fellow ode 2 but then got sticker shot with the grinder being more expensive than the MM. 

When we used the Ninja coffee maker I’d usually fill it up to the 6 water line. Would this count as a half pot with the MM? Also read that the KBGV doesn’t do as great as a half pot. Feels like there is so much differing information. 

I didn’t realize this entire process would be such a science. Seems intimidating. ",1,1764128939.0,Moccamaster,0,1.0,False

They're all in the early 20's to early 30's range because I really want to support the things they do. And they do good work! I just can't get over some of the bullshit. 

Instead of actual ""action"" they spend their time complaining and gossiping. Any time I try to turn the topic to actual action I'm dismissed.

They use my house as a dumping ground for clothes and toys that they plan to donate. I don't see any forward momentum in that regard. 

They want to host a 'thanksgiving' here on the Saturday after Thanksgiving and they, very literally, worked through my freezer to think of things to cook. 

The first time I met the ""leader"" I had to tell her that she could NOT get a key to my house when she asked. On our first meeting. 

I've spent hundreds of dollars to buy things for them, like clothing racks, coffee cups, lightbulbs because *evidently* my bulbs were too harsh. They had a hard time taping things onto my ancient walls so now they want to hot glue things. I'm just fucking done. 

I guess, what I'm asking here, is did we do any of that?

Did we have ""sugar mom's""? 

Did we have places we could just run rampant? Maybe we did and didn't realize it?

1p6xlnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/HocTiengviet/comments/1p6xlnf/a_vietnamese_person_perspectives_and_tips_on_how/,A Vietnamese person: perspectives and tips on how to speak fluently,"Hello everyone! While commenting on an article about how to speak 6 tones fluently, I suddenly wanted to share this idea *(because I'm currently teaching my baby to speak)*, hoping it will be a little helpful for those who are just starting to speak Vietnamese:

1. you should learn tones from ""**unstressed sound**"" **words** first *(sry, i dont know how to write this, i use google translate XD, u can look exemple)*, then the ""/"" sound, then ""\\"" and ""."", and finally try ""?"" and ""\~""

2. starting with unstressed tones, you can speak well in combination with words with the ""/"" and ""\\"" sounds, with some words with the ""? and \~"" sound you can ""temporarily transform"" to sound ""/"", for example:

\- **\[Cho Tôi ly\]** ***(unstressed*** **sound*****)*** cafe nâu **\[ít đá**\]***(""/""*** *sounds) ; or*  
*+* cafe đen **\[nhiều đường\]** ***(""\\""*** *sounds)*,  
\+ ít SỨA nhé !  
*(= sữa . ""\~"" sound transform ""/"" to keep the flow with ""/"" words before and after ""Sứa"")*  
*(normal person in that context will understand, sometimes people South Side also pronounce like that)*

*-* **\[HỎI\]** giá bao nhiêu \[**NHỈ ?**\] => *You can talk another words same meaning*  
=> if you say ""**Hói** giá bao nhiêu **nhí ?""** they only understand ""giá bao nhiêu"" , ""Hói"" and ""nhí"" no meaning, not right in this *context* !!!  
*=>* **\[Thế\]** ly này bao nhiêu **\[Tiền\]** ? => more ez to talk, words \[Thế (or) Thế thì ......?\] same meaning with \[Hỏi (or) Xin hỏi là ...\]. Key words in this context is ""**Bao nhiêu tiền?""** (how much ?).

3. Sounds ""."" sometime you can ignore it-> use ""unstressed sound"" , or transform to ""same sound"" the next words. for example:  
**\[Thực sự\]** ly coffe này **\[Đậm đà\]** quá, ngon **\[tuyệt**\]! Sub: ""This cup of coffee is **really** *(thực sự)* **strong** *(đậm đà)* and **delicious** *(ngon tuyệt)*.""  
=> \[Thưc sư ly coffe\] -> *All 4 word ""****unstressed sound""*** **--- \[**này **Đầm** đà\] -> *transform ""."" in ""Đậm đà"" to all 3 ""\\"" sound ---* quá , \[ngon tuyết\] -> *this hard, because ""tuyệt"" without ""."" sound is ""tuyêt"" but u have to say ""tuyết"".*  
But after all, more ez to talk, nice flow in context, people more ez to understand you!

4. Try saying each word one at a time, holding your breath before articulating the tone of the words (1 sec / 1 word) -> You and your listener both have time to infer the context of the conversation.

5. Vietnamese Tones practice for beginners is difficult. Try with sentences that have many words with 1 or 2 tones close together, avoid putting the ""/"" tone right next to the ""\\"", then use the ""unstressed sound"" tone (no word stress sound) -*> use example in \[3.\]*

Wish this help u a liitle bit, welcome to VN (sry my English not good, im training writing skill and sometime use google translate =))) .Please give me feedback if there are any mistakes or confusing places. You are welcome!  
*(P/s: these icon ""=))"" mean LOL , in VN: people 8x, 9x, genz always do this in chat and if you try to use this when Vietnamese people joke, they will blow thier mind =)))*",3,1764128860.0,HocTiengviet,0,1.0,False

Being used always felt so hot to me. A few months back I started dating this girl, so I quit findom. However, I still had the itch to be used financially but there was no way I was gonna cheat on this woman.

Right from the beginning she knew I was totally submissive and was happy to take the dominant role in the relationship, but she was very new to being dominant. She had no idea what findom was, and she always insisted on paying her share when we went out. On our first date, she even paid for my coffee! A couple of weeks ago I finally told her about findom and that I've paid random women online money just to be called a bitch. I told her I'd like it if she ordered me to pay for random stuff. She found it very amusing but liked the sound of it.

So, She slowly started ordering me to pay for stuff like her gym membership and some cab rides to and from her work. I begged her to use me more, so she added my card to her Amazon account as a default payment method. She made me turn of sms notifications for online transactions on my card so I get notified whenever she uses her ""ATM Bitch"". This was exciting but the transaction amounts were between $30-$70 and I wanted more to scratch the itch. So I begged her for more.

Finally, last night, she ordered me to hand her my card and lie down on the floor. I obliged, she used me as a footrest and started shopping online on my card. I was excited cause I had no idea what she was buying. After about 30 mins, she allowed me to check my phone. She had just made  purchases at Louis Vuitton and Fendi on my card, totally $1700! My previous maximum in a single findom drain session was $600. My girlfriend just drained almost 3 times that amount and I was so turned on.

1p6xj9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1p6xj9y/so_id_like_to_date_butwhy_do_we_want_to_do_this/,So I'd like to date but...why do we want to do this again? (Slight vent),"So this past year I wanted to put myself out there in the dating scene. I went on two dates with one guy back in the beginning of the year, and honestly, that's a lot for me. 

I'm winning : D

Now, while I do not want to be in a relationship, I wouldn't mind casually dating here and there. Meet for coffee, get to know each other a bit, ya know? Simple shit. 

That being said, I've come across some ""logistical"" issues, that honestly, make me feel like...fuck this, I don't really want to participate in this particular human experience. 

Firstly, if I want to meet a guy, I have to use dating apps, go to a gay club, or...um...actually, that might just be it. That being said, I really don't enjoy the apps. They feel like looking through a menu or catalog, and most interactions feel inauthentic. Overall, a hollow experience. And when it comes to club, I just don't vibe with the environment. Music is usually ""pop-house-y"" and I'm a bit of a bass head. And I always feel odd there. Like, I'm not gay enough or something. Personal problem, I know, but these just aren't viable options for me. 

Secondly, everything is White, logistically (and culturally, but that's a different conversation all together). 

It makes sense for a person to want to interact with an individual with similar characteristics and such. And I've had plenty of experiences with not being someone's ""preference"". I don't think this is a bad thing or anything, but I see where I stand in the grand scheme of things. So, as a black man living a state with a 3% African-American population, the idea of having a ""preference"" is a privilege I do not have, unless I literally move. 

Mind you, I don't have a racial preference. It's already slim picking out here. That's self-sabotage. But when I do interact with a person who's a different ethnicity, there are a couple of questions that I ask myself, like ""Am I just a fetish to this person?"" which, unfortunately, is a common occurrence for most of us. 

Special shout out to the ""AAVE"" kids and the people who think the have a ""inner black woman"" inside them. You do not. 

Thirdly, um...ok, this one is just a personal opinion, and maybe a bit more, but I can't interact with a man unless he is fully attracted to men. I don't want to say he has to be gay, cuz we love a ""spectrum"", but there are a large majority of men who are only physically attracted to men. The emotional and mental attraction is something they just don't feel. To each their own, but, in the past, I've met people who saw me as either just a hole or pole. A means to an end. And, I just wanna say, there's nothing wrong with that. Throw that ass, and sling that dick. But it's a trifecta: Physical, emotional, and the mental. If all three are not present outside of the bedroom, all we have is a transactional relationship, builded on...throwing ass, and slinging dick. And the bedroom isn't the place to connect with a person. At least, it's not gonna start there for me. 

There are other things too, like:

* People who've been single for awhile trying to trauma bond
* Trying to be in a relationship, just because of proximity, instead of compatiblity 
* Lack of relationship resources 
* Age

\- Oh, before I forget, age is actually a huge issue and it's probably in my top three reasons to not date. I'm 34. Anyone under 27 - 28-ish will not be it for me. We have different life experiences, at different points in life, and I just flat out refuse to interact with young men. On the other end, older dudes (over 50) are kinda...idunno, it's kind of the same issue with younger guys, but I'm the younger guy. Same logic though. Different points in life, etc, etc. Mind you, I understand why sometimes there's a large age gap our relationships, and I don't judge because that's not my business. 

Finally, and I might be reaching on this one, but, I feel like there's more headaches and heartbreaks in the ""quest for love"". A lot of my friends seem miserable, on their third, fourth, or sixth partnerships. Second or third divorce. A lot of negative experiences. And the ""my boyfriend of 3 weeks is cheating on me..."" post, to the ""I'm 19 and I've never been in a relationship..."" just make me not want to participate in this human experience. Just the pursuit is hazardous. Looking at my DMs on Grindr, sad because someone didn't return my message of my bootyhole and internalizing that as ""I'm never gonna find love"" is insane. Dating based on your position in the bedroom is just a notch under that, in my opinion. Respectfully. 

Speaking for myself, I'm just as failable as anyone else. But from an outside perspective, why do we want this again? What's the big appeal about being in a relationship?

 It feels like a gauntlet everyone is expected to participate in, and for what? Everyone seems stressed and in mental anguish. 

Have you seen ""Scandal""?  Absolutely not. 

I think I'm good on the whole thing. Everything would have to happen serendipitously. And I'm aware that the odds are most definitely not in my favor.  I may never go on a date again. It's probably not gonna be anytime soon. 

I'm not saying it's impossible, but I'm not holding my breath. 

I need to secure the bag. 

If anything, the past couple of years have taught me a couple of things:

1. It's a privilege to be in a romantic relationship. With anyone. 
2. You cannot find it, it must find you (I know it's bullshit, but it's unfortunately true...bullshit)
3. Just because you're not in a relationship, doesn't mean you're missing anything (for my conical-single peeps out there, ask yourself: If you've never been in a relationship before, how do you know what you're missing?
4. Humans need community. But you don't need a romantic partner. The ""need"" is overrated AF.

\[SLEEPY/SOFT VOICE SLOWLY GETTING MORE AWAKE\]



(Stretching noises into an exhale) 



\[WHISPER\] (groan) That was definitely not enough sleep. I'm sure I can sneak a few more hours in, and then I'll make-



...



And why are you already awake? 



...



\[SFX: BLANKET RUSTLE\]



No, no, no... You aren't going anywhere. Get back into my arms. Come on...



...



It's a Saturday, and you have nowhere to be. 



...



There are no secret plans.



...



I would know because I'm the one who writes them on the calendar attached to the fridge. 



...



(laugh) Of course, you forgot about it. But it's fine, I don't mind being the one in charge of writing all the important dates, appointments, and things like that. It helps me know exactly when I can keep your butt all to myself without any interruptions. 



...



You say stalker... I say perfect planner. 



...



Now, are you going back to sleep, or are we getting up for the day?



...



Nope, you know how this works. We are a team, and if you are up doing things, then I'm going to be up doing things. 



...



Yes... The other way is different. If I'm up doing things, you should stay asleep. It's balance, baby. 



...



(laugh) Well, I don't hear you complaining when it does happen. You are so cute and snuggled up in the blanket, sleeping your heart away. 



...



Do you want to see some pictures? I take so many pictures when you are napping. I think most of my camera roll is pictures of you or things that I think you might like. Even things that remind me of you. 



...



Which reminds me, I have to show you this bear cake pop. When I saw it, and was immediately reminded of you. 



...



\[SFX: PHONE NOISES\]



Here, look. (Soft laugh) 



...



Well, bears in real life are so cute and cuddly. Forget the fact that you only have one chance to cuddle a bear. But also, look at that little drawn face. He looks so happy. 



...



Okay, whatever you say. \[WHISPER\] Just now, I can see that little smile you're trying to hide. 



...



And before you ask, yes, I got you one, and it's in the fridge as we speak. 



...



There was no way I would take a picture of food and not bring that exact thing home for you. 



...



I know, I know. I'm so sweet. Now, something way, way, wayyyy more important. We've been up for too long and haven't even kissed. 



...



No, it is that serious, actually. I think I might die if I don't get a kiss in the next two seconds.



...



Oh no, I feel it. This is the end for me... Tell my baby, I love them so very, very much. 



...



You would just let me die? Instead of kissing your love, your baby, and your forever partner \[FAST WHISPER\] because I would never let you get with anyone else. Because you are mine and mine alone, and if someone even so much as dares to ask you out, I will send them on a free ticket to the shadow realm without even thinking.



...



Bring your face here. 



\[SFX: STRUGGLE\] 



No, no, where are you trying to go? 



...



To brush your teeth? When have I ever cared about that? 



...



Baby, I've literally done worse things with you. My mouth has been on every inch of you, in you, around you, on you. I don't think kissing you when you first get up is anything bad. 



...



Alrighty, let's go.



\[SFX: BLANKET RUSTLE/GETTING UP\]



We are going to brush our teeth. 



...



Yup, together. 



...



We are even going to hold hands. 



...



(laugh) I don't careee. You have nothing to do today, and I have nothing to do today. So WEEEE are going to do nothing together. 



\[SFX: FOOTSTEPS\]



Walk with me. 



...



Exactly, our feet have to move at the same time.



...



It's not stupid. (laugh) It's love and very important. If I let you go on your own, I will not know when you'll be back. I'm like a puppy. You left my sight for five minutes, and I don't know if it's actually been seven hours.



...



It's not extreme, it's the truth. 



...



Here's your toothbrush with some... toothpaste. 



...



I'm doing it, I'm doing it. 



\[SFX: TEETH BRUSHING\]



\[TALKING WITH TOOTHPASTE\] No, No, you’re not done yet. You stay right there next to the wall.  And close your ears, save yourself from hearing me spit. 



…



(laugh) I can’t hear youuu.



…



\[NO MORE TOOTHPASTE\] Ugh, okay, now that that’s done… come here.



…



\[SOFT\] No, no, no, you’re forgetting something. 



…



Mhm… (kiss) 



QUICK PAUSE



Nope, you’re not free yet. 



…



We have to at least kiss three times. 



…



One is too little and two is not nearly enough, plus it’s an even number, and we don’t do even numbers here.



...



(Five more kisses) I know I snuck some in there.



...



I will do it again. 



...



\[SFX: FOOTSTEPS WALKING FROM SPEAKER\]



Now, where are you going?



...



You do not need to get dressed. We aren't leaving the house at all.



...



Nope, we don't have to get food. Remember that stew we put in the crockpot last night?



...



So no need for scrambling to find something for dinner. And for breakfast, I could make us some eggs and toast?



...



I can put jam on the toast. We did get that BlackBerry one, and I've been wanting to try it for so long. 



...



I do not need help, but thank you, baby. (three kisses)



...



\[WHISPER\] Okay, what you can help me with is getting cosy and grabbing one of those books of yours and getting lost in it.



...



You can watch me, but from the comfort of the couch. I don't want you standing. 



...



(laugh) Yes... I will let you read to me. 



...



You can pick whatever book you want. Even you're crazy ones with tentacles. 



...



It's not all the books, but there are at least two of them. 



...



You can hide them on your bookshelf all you want, but I've read all of the synopses.  



...



(laugh) It was a little secret until now. 



...



\[SOFT\] Have I? I don't know... I guess you'll never know. I'll be in the kitchen while you find which one you want to read. Don't forget to grab a blanket. 



\[SFX: WALKING AWAY FROM LISTENER\]



\[TIME PASS\]



Did you pick one?



...



I don't know why I thought you would only grab one. 



...



It's fine, baby. You could've grabbed the entire bookshelf as long as it makes you happy. 



...



But if you end up one day wanting to do that, let me know. 



...



So I can move it for you.



...



I know you can do it for yourself, but you don't need to. 



...



Go ahead, sit down, put your feet up. I already finished the eggs, and the toast should be done anytime-



\[SFX: TOASTER NOISE\]



Speak of the devil. I will be buttering and jamming it up for you.



\[SFX: TOAST JAMMING\]



Do you want some coffee, tea, water... I think we have orange juice.



...



Got ya, I'm on it. 



\[SFX: GETTING GLASS THEN POURING DRINK\]



Alright, I think that's everything. 



...



Yup, I put it in your favourite glass. 



\[SFX: PLACING TRAY ON TABLE\]



...



I am sitting on the floor. 



...



No, you look so cute, and I don't want you to move. 



...



I'll go up there with you when we finish eating. 



...



It's a deal, but eat before it gets cold. There's nothing worse than cold eggs and toast. 



\[TIME PASS\] 



That was good. Let me take your plate. 



...



Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere. I'm just stacking it on top of mine. 



...



And now time to get comfy with you. Sit up for a second.



...



Because you're reading and I don't want my head in the way of that (laugh into kisses)



\[SFX: SHUFFLE\]

But I’m closeted bi, I live a straight life but I crave dick, only to hook up, have never felt any interest in a relationship with a guy. 

One fantasy of mine is to be at a restaurant or something like that and encounter a sexy younger twink and somehow eye fucking occurs, a knowing look… Somehow it’s communicated that he’s leaving soon, I end up following him out. We don’t speak many words but whether by walking, taxi/uber, or the subway, we go back to his place and hook up. 

Should I be thinking of any strategy or likely places to try to make this happen? Or is it going to just be luck of the draw that the right guy might be working somewhere where I’m having a coffee or a a drink or something?

Insomniac na ako noong bata pa ako kaya matagal ko nang akala na second nature ko na 'to. Nanggaling ako sa high school na sobrang daming magpagawa ng mga projects. Core memory ko before graduation ay nung final exams namin, wala nang nag-aaral and instead puro mga nag-eedit sa Canva/Word kasi may presentation pa kami pagkatapos ng tests. As in isinantabi na talaga namin mga exams/written works kasi mas importante talaga mga performance tasks na 50% ng grade (60% pa nga for ibang subjects). Kung magkikita-kita kami para gumawa ng project, madalas nagiging overnight para lang matapos. Isa sa mga hindi ko pa din napapaniwalang nakayanan ko noon ay gumawa ng four minute music video in three days.

Akala ko nakaranas na ako ng matinding puyat noong high school. Yung 3-5 days walang tulog, nagkakaroon lang ng maliit na 5-10 minute power naps kapag 30 hours ka nang gising at wala nang pambili ng coffee o energy drinks, at yung dahilan lang kung bakit 5-10 minutes lang power nap mo ay sobrang uncomfortable ng armchair sa classroom at kinikick out nila ang mga natutulog sa library. Yung sobrang antok mo na pero sobrang tagal mo na ding gising parang ang sakit pumikit nang matagal. Kapag pinapatay yung ilaw para mas makita daw yung presentation ng teacher ninyo, imbis na makuha ng antok, nakatitig ka nalang sa liwanag nung projection kasi ewan ko ba. Tapos kapag bubuksan ang ilaw pagkatapos, ANG SAKIT NG EYE STRAIN!!! Na para bang akong bampirang na-flash bang. Genuinely, I've been told I look like I snorted something because of how red my eyes became back in those days. But in comparison to how I'm doing now, those days seemed far more bearable.

I have not slept since last Saturday. Maybe had gotten one or two power naps while going home from university dahil nanggagaling ako sa malayo but that's it for the most part. One or two lang kasi alaala ko nakatulog lang ako when I decided to treat myself at nag-Grab pauwi. May klase pa ako sa hapon at nakainom na ako ng tatlong cobra para lang magising. Halos araw-araw pasok ko, Thursday being my vacant day pero parang hindi din kasi tuwing vacant day nagpapaassign ng homework mga professor o nag-aannounce kung may kailangan bang dalhin. Dahil sobrang time conscious (and #1 cramming hater) ko, maaga kong tinapos lahat ng mga pinapagawa nila and I'm desperately hoping they forget my block exists tomorrow kasi plano kong itulog ang buong araw.

Notable characters: 1 female boss, about 2-4 workers in different desks

Notable gameplay mechanics: clickeable game, you (the female boss) click on ""tasks"" (blocks of color) on your desk and take them to the workers desks (making sort of a stack of tasks).

i’ve been dealing with this issue for a little over a year now. i thought i had actually solved the problem when i switched from using a brita filter to a pur filter for my drinking water, and my symptoms completely disappeared! i felt completely normal for like 4 months, and then recently over the span of a week or two the symptoms all came back and have stayed for a month now. 

i haven’t changed anything other than i did switch the filter in my pur pitcher because it was time, and it was like a week or two after that that my symptoms returned. i wondered if i put the replacement filter in wrong or it was faulty, so i replaced it with another one which hasn’t helped. i also tried going back to water that has been helpful before (gallon purified water from the store and evian bottled water) but this time around that hasn’t helped. nothing else in my life has changed so i just don’t know what could have brought the symptoms back?? right now i’m trying distilled water, just to see, which is maybe helping a little but i’m not sure yet

also, i swear sometimes drinking water makes my symptoms worse. days when i mostly drink coffee and celsius, i end up feeling better than on days when i drink a lot of water. does this happen to anyone else?

if anyone has any suggestions or has had a similar experience, i’d love to hear about it!

But consistency doesn’t start when the market opens, it starts with what you do before it.

Here’s my exact morning routine that keeps me sharp and emotionally neutral before every trading session:

4:30 AM – Wake Up (2 hrs before market open)

Just movement, get vertical, hydrate, and reset.

4:40 AM – Cold shower

Instantly wake up the body. Reminds me I’m in control before the market even opens.

4:50 AM – Light cardio or stretching (15-20 min)

Nothing crazy. Just enough to get blood flowing and mind alert. A moving body makes for a focused trader. I do have sciatica issues, so I do focus a lot on back and hip mobility.

5:15 AM – Breathwork (4-7-8 pattern, 10 cycles) or (4-4-4-4 box breathing)

Inhale 4 sec

Hold 7 sec

Exhale 8 sec

It’s simple, but it flips your nervous system from reactive to calm, which is where all good trading happens.

6:00 AM – Black coffee + silence

No screens yet. I let caffeine hit while staying off stimulation.

6:30 AM – Game Plan Review

No trades before open. I use this time to:

Review my pre-written game plan (done night before)

1p6xcov,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p6xcov,Seeking advice on similar colours potentially clashing,"Hello,

I love these occasional chairs, as well as the sofa. The materials are different, and the colours are also different, however they are very closely matched. I am worried that if they are too closely matched, it will look like I have tried to perfectly match the colours and failed, and so will look funny. I’m hoping the difference in fabric will be obvious enough that you can tell they aren’t supposed to match exactly.

I have included a close-up of the fabric for reference (pic 3 is the chair, 4 is the sofa - I put them next to each other so you can flick between easily). 

They won’t be directly next to each other, but will be separated by a coffee table (2 chairs one side, sofa on the other). 

Would love some advice, as I have gone cross-eyed trying to work it out.

His feet finally touched hard ground and he strolled into Ouled Amer, he walked along the main street and spotted the Café, a sight for sore-eyes. He's been worried that after all this time he'd been given false info and would be left stranded in this remote village. He chuckled to himself and entered the building, sitting in the stool in front of the counter.  


The bar owner came up to him ""salam brother, Tea or Coffee?""

Abdelaziz leaned in,

*""Men often have two faces,""*

The bar owners eyes froze on him and in a moment of recognition, he leaned forward to him slightly and lowered his voice *""one smiles the other cries,* come to the back comrade*""*

He took Abdelaziz by the arm and started down a set of stairs, illuminate by a single flickering light. As the chatter of the cafe began to fade, he became aware of a new, more hushed chatter from the basement.

He turned the corner and was face to face with 5 men all sat around a table, dressed in Green Military garb. He would have mistaken them for frenchmen if it wasnt for their unkempt appearances

""Houari!"" the bar owner banged on the wall to get one mans attention, a tall, thin man with a wiry moustache lifted his head. ""Ah! the boy from Tlemcen"" he came around the cable and shook Abdelaziz's hand.

It was a slow Wednesday when I first saw him.

I was scrolling through my phone behind the counter when movement on the monitor caught my eye. Camera 5 — fourth-floor hallway. A man stood at the far end, half turned away from the lens.

He wasn’t a guest I’d checked in. No luggage, no keycard in hand. Just a dark jacket, too long in the sleeves, and a posture that made my shoulders tighten. He was leaning slightly toward one of the doors, like he was listening through it.

I leaned closer to the screen.

He never knocked. Never moved his hands. He just stood with his head tilted, as if he was learning whoever was sleeping inside by their breathing alone.

After a minute, he stepped away and walked slowly down the hall. He passed three other doors, ignoring them, and stopped at 412. My stomach sank. I’d checked in a woman traveling alone there an hour before.

He didn’t touch the handle. He just leaned in again.

I picked up the lobby phone and dialed 412.

“Front desk,” I said when she answered, keeping my voice steady. “Sorry to bother you, just checking that everything’s okay with your room.”

On the monitor, the man straightened. His head turned toward the camera, even though there’s no way he could have known which little black dome in the ceiling was watching him.

“Yes?” the woman said, confused. “Everything’s fine.”

The man began walking toward the camera, toward the elevator.

“If you need anything,” I said, eyes locked on his slow, deliberate steps, “just call down. Don’t open the door for anyone you’re not expecting, okay?”

She hesitated. “Did someone—”

The feed flickered, just for a second. When it came back up, the hallway was empty.

I checked the elevator cam. Nothing. The stairwell cam. Nothing. He had simply stopped existing somewhere between the door and the camera.

I told myself it was a glitch. Old wiring. Cheap equipment. I drank more coffee and stayed in the lobby instead of the back room that night.

Around three, a guest came down to complain. “Somebody keeps walking past my door,” he said. “Back and forth. Shoes just… sliding. It’s freaking me out.”

“Which room?” I asked.

“Four-oh-nine.”

The room directly across from the empty end of the hall.

By the time my shift ended, I had almost convinced myself I’d imagined the whole thing. The morning clerk came in, cheerful and tired, and I left with the sky turning that pale gray that makes headlights look desperate.

The next night, I checked the cameras every hour.

Nothing at midnight. Nothing at one. At two, a housekeeper doing laundry. At three, the parking lot cat chasing something only it could see.

At 3:17 a.m., Camera 5 flickered again.

The man stood in the hallway, closer to the camera this time. Same jacket, same too-long sleeves, same head slightly bowed. But he wasn’t listening at a door.

He was facing the camera directly.

The picture was grainy, and the light in that hallway always had a slight green tint, but I could see his eyes clearly. They weren’t glowing or empty or any of the dramatic things you see in movies. They were just… wrong. Too focused. Like he was concentrating on remembering how to look like a person.

He began to walk.

Not toward any room. Not toward the elevator. Straight toward the lens.

With each step, the image warped slightly, as if the camera couldn’t quite decide where to draw his outline. The hallway behind him stretched, compressed, bent.

He came close enough that his face filled the frame.

The picture froze.

For a full ten seconds, the monitors showed his face in perfect, motionless clarity. His nose was slightly crooked, his lips parted like he was about to speak, but his eyes weren’t looking into the camera anymore.

They were looking slightly down.

Like he could see through the feed and into the lobby.

Into me.

The hotel’s phone started ringing.

I couldn’t take my gaze off the screen. For a second I thought I saw the faint reflection of the lobby counter in his pupils. The ringing grew louder. It took everything I had to look away, grab the receiver, and press it to my ear.

“Front desk,” I managed.

A woman’s voice, shaking, whispered, “Someone’s at my door. They’re not knocking. They’re just… breathing.”

“Which room?” I asked, even though I already knew.

“Four-twelve.”

When I looked back up, the hallway camera showed only an empty corridor. The man was gone. The elevator cam showed nothing. The stairwell, nothing.

I told her to stay on the phone with me.

“Do you hear anything now?” I asked.

There was a pause. Then: “No. Wait. The light under the door just went dark.”

“Dark how?”

“Like someone is standing in front of it.”

I listened to her breathing, the clock on the wall, the humming vending machine. Every sound felt loud and far away.

After a moment, she said very quietly, “I think he knows you’re listening.”

The line went dead.

Before I could call her back, the monitors flickered. For a single frame, every camera showed the same thing: the lobby, from behind my back. My own silhouette at the counter.

And behind me, standing too close, a figure in a dark jacket, just out of focus.

The next frame, everything was normal.

I spun in place. The lobby was empty except for me.

Room 412 checked out early the next morning. I never found out what happened between her breathing into the phone and her rolling her suitcase past the front desk, eyes red, not looking at me.

I still work the night audit.

I still watch the cameras.

Sometimes, around 3:17 a.m., Camera 5 flickers, and for a heartbeat the hallway is just a little too long, and the light over one door just a little too dim.

I don’t answer the phone on the first ring anymore.

My husband and I have finally full auto-ed (a coffee shop), we're past day 25, and, if we're being honest, we're kinda bored with the restaurant. Each day takes a long time, one of us is working the booking desk, and the other is just standing there. We have file cabinets with more teleports, grabbers, and coffee machines than we could possibly need.

""My husband meet a woman in secret.

I sat in the backseat of an expensive town car, my expression calm as I quietly watched.

The girl was young— They were passionately kissing.""

---

Chapter 1 Her Husband Keeps a Mistress

At the entrance of a luxury villa in Kingsward Fringe, Francesca Ward sat in the backseat of an expensive town car, her expression calm as she quietly watched her husband meet a woman in secret.

The girl was young—a vision in a simple white dress, the very picture of innocence and charm.

They held hands, their body language telling an intimate story. Lovers, unmistakably.

Francesca's husband, Julian Hale, had a softness in his eyes she hadn't seen in years.

The girl tilted her delicate face up at him, her tone almost petulant. “My feet hurt, Julian. Carry me!”

Francesca braced herself, certain that Julian would refuse. He was notorious for his aloof demeanor, his temper as cold and sharp as glass. No matter how favored a new lover might be, she couldn’t imagine him indulging such childish whims.

But in the next moment, Francesca’s certainty shattered.

Julian brushed his finger gently against the girl’s small nose, an oddly restrained tenderness in his movement. Without a word, he lifted her effortlessly into his arms.

She nestled into him, her pale hands finding their place at the back of his neck, her touch tracing lazily down the dark strands of his hair.

Francesca’s gaze snagged on the faint red mark at the nape of Julian’s neck. A birthmark—a blood-red freckle more sensual in its placement than it should have been. She remembered the heat of his reaction the single time she’d grazed it unintentionally, his frustration and control unraveling into something harsh, something unyielding.

Now that same man leaned against the pillar of the garden pavilion with this girl cradled against him, his eyes lit with undisguised desire.

Francesca drew her own eyes shut. She didn’t want to see anymore.

Julian was an image of reckless passion she had never known. This wasn’t the man she had married.

When she opened her eyes again, there was no trace of emotion—no anger, no affection, no pain. Just a void where feeling used to be.

Love, after all, could disappear. And when it did, only practicalities remained.

The villa where Julian whispered sweet nothings to his mistress? That, Francesca noted dryly, was marital property. Jointly owned.

She wouldn’t let a pair of shameless lovers make a mockery of her. Speaking calmly, she addressed her secretary in the front seat. “Annie, has he been with her consistently these last three months?”

Annie’s reply was brisk and certain. “The girl’s name is Beatrice Caldwell. She’s something of a childhood sweetheart. Three months ago, Mr. Hale pulled strings to place her in the company, and since then, he’s been exceptionally protective of her.”

She handed Francesca a thick dossier. Francesca leafed through it languidly. She supposed she could grant their wish for legitimacy.

But Julian would need to pay. Half the marital property, nothing less. Francesca would take the money and the shares, walk away—clean, decisive.

Outside, the autumn leaves gleamed golden under the glow of a sinking sun. The light spangled its edges, dazzling, almost unbearably bright.

Francesca composed herself, then dialed Julian’s number.

It rang several times before he picked up, his voice clipped and cold. “What is it?”

She lowered her lashes. “It’s my birthday today. Will you be coming home for dinner?”

A pause. Brief, but telling. A hesitant silence where Julian undoubtedly calculated excuses. Business dinners, unavoidable appointments—he had an arsenal of justifications ready.

But Francesca caught the faintest echo of a girl’s voice in the background, sweet and coy. “Julian, are you done yet? You’re not allowed to talk to her anymore…”

The line faltered. Julian cleared his throat, his tone colder when he spoke again. “If there’s nothing urgent, I’ll hang up now.”

The low buzz of a disconnected call. Francesca wasn’t surprised; Julian had always been brisk, efficient, immune to unnecessary sentiment.

Annie fumed from the front seat. “That man! He’s—unbelievable! He even forgot—”

Francesca gave the briefest pause but wasn’t perturbed. Instead, a sardonic thought flickered in her mind: Apologies for interrupting Mr. Hale’s courtship of his young mistress. What else could she do? As the legal Mrs. Hale, she was feeling decidedly displeased tonight.

She let a faint smile ghost across her lips. “He hasn’t forgotten. He simply doesn’t care. Annie, contact the utilities and have the water, electricity, and gas to this villa shut off. Let’s see if that brings him home.”

Annie gave a low laugh, unable to suppress her admiration. “You’re brilliant, Mrs. Hale.”

Francesca didn’t reply. Her gaze drifted to the car window, to the tapestry of the twilight—molten light spilling into the seams of gathering clouds.

She remembered another sunset, years ago. A night washed in gold and promises. She had asked Julian then, playfully but earnestly: Do you think our marriage will last forever?

And he’d kissed her temple, his voice warm—almost solemn. Of course, Fran. You’re the most important thing in the world to me.

Most important, she mused bitterly now, until she’d become expendable. The value of things became clearer with time—and it appeared the only thing worth holding onto was money.

A single tear slid down her face, silent and unwelcome.

\*\*\*\*\*

When Francesca returned to their marital home at Crowncrest Court, sunset fully bled into dusk. Half an hour later, Annie delivered the divorce papers.

Francesca’s demands were simple: half of everything.

She slipped into the bath, letting warmth ease into her bones. Afterward, dressed and ready to move on with the evening, she hesitated. Something idle and unbidden propelled her back to the full-length mirror. She let the crisp white bathrobe slide off her shoulders until her reflection stared back, bare and unflinchingly honest beneath the gleam of the chandelier.

Years of strain marked her body with an elegance that was lean but unforgiving. Her ivory skin retained a cool, refined beauty, but the softer curves had given way to the demands of time, effort, and endurance.

And wasn’t that the difference. Wasn’t she the difference. Her gaze turned darker as fleeting images of Julian and Beatrice—Julian’s hands on her, their fevered, unrestrained intimacy—played cruelly in her mind.

It had to be different with her. Rawer, wilder—more alive than the measured, tempered rhythm she and Julian had fallen into long ago.

A flicker of shame passed over her face, and she frowned, disgusted by her own willingness to compare.

Francesca tightened the robe across her chest, turned from the mirror, and left the room without looking back.

The door to the walk-in closet creaked open—softly, deliberately.

Julian was back.

He stood there at the threshold, his presence filling the space with quiet authority. The tailored black shirt and sharp slacks sculpted his tall, lean frame, the sleek fabric hinting at power without showiness. In the bright, diffused light, the angular contours of his face exuded the intoxicating allure of a man who had long since mastered the art of unobtainable charm.

Francesca couldn't help but think: Even without the billions to his name, Julian alone—just looking like that—would draw a legion of women ready to lose themselves in him, no questions asked.

She had shared his bed for four years. That alone, she thought dryly, wasn’t the worst bargain.

Their eyes met with uncanny precision, a brief, wordless transaction. Something passed between them, something neither bothered to say aloud.

Julian stepped further into the room. His movements were unhurried, the predator’s deliberate grace. Soon, he came to a halt behind Francesca, close enough for their reflections to mingle in the full-length mirror. She had finished dressing—her robe smoothed and fastened with clinical perfection, her cascading black hair now swept into an immaculate twist. Even fresh out of the shower, she emanated the steel veneer of a woman impossible to unsettle. A queen armored in surface poise.

Yet Julian’s gaze lingered, his silence thick with some ineffable tension. He remembered—vividly—how different she’d been on their wedding night. Slightly vulnerable, delicate even.

Vulnerable enough to tremble under his gaze, as if proximity alone left her skimming the edge of fear.

That night, nothing had happened between them.

Two weeks later, when a business crisis had blindsided him, it was Francesca who had lain trembling in his arms, whispering his name. He’d held her tightly, ferociously, that night, and it was then they had consummated their marriage—truly become husband and wife.

They had, each of them, been the other’s first.

But in the years since, those moments of intimacy had grown scarce. Rarer still was anything resembling surrender from her. At home, she was the unassailable Mrs. Hale; at Rowan Group, she was the unflinching Ms. Ward, wielding authority with a deftness few dared to challenge. And on the rare nights when their hours converged, and they were close enough for such entanglements—bed was no different. Francesca remained distant, remote, disciplined. Even there, she held herself. Julian could swear she had never once let go—not fully, not utterly. Forget abandon; she hadn’t dared to indulge, even passingly.

Over time, he had grown bored of it.

Now, a faint smile pulled at his lips—a flicker of sardonic humor, of provocation. “You’re the one who had the power shut off at the villa, right?” he murmured, the teasing lightness edged with taunt. He stepped closer, his reflection beside hers in the glass. “Just because I gave a little attention to the daughter of a… mentor figure—’care and concern for the younger generation,’ that’s all it was—and suddenly I’ve disgraced you?”

Francesca didn’t flinch. Her gaze held Julian’s in the mirror, cool and immovable.

He let the silence stretch long enough to savor. Then, his mind caught onto something else. He traced the dates in his head, calculating quickly. A knowing glimmer lit his eyes.

Her ovulation period.

Julian leaned in, close enough that the heat of his breath brushed the curve of her ear. Lightly, his fingers grazed the slope of her earlobe before his lips followed with a whispered tease: “Is this celebration really about my birthday? Or is it about… another need? Mrs. Hale, is it that strong at twenty-six?” His voice dipped, ridded with wicked amusement.

The words were insolent, but Francesca didn’t need him to clarify his intent. She knew exactly what he wanted.

A child.

The patriarch of the Hale family still controlled ten percent of Rowan Group shares. A grandchild would cement Julian’s position, solidify his hand.

But what Julian didn’t know… was how unlikely a child was for them now.

She looked down, her lashes casting shadows against her cheekbones. Pain flickered briefly across her features—a private ache buried quickly, masked behind cool composure.

Julian’s interest, however, had shifted unmistakably. He leaned in closer now, his intentions unmistakable, his hands anchoring her waist with ease. Before Francesca could withdraw, he scooped her into his arms.

She stiffened instantly as he carried her with practiced strength into their bedroom, laying her atop the impossibly soft sheets of their sprawling bed. His weight pressed down with deliberate purpose, a predator’s focus.

But she wasn’t going to make it easy for him.

Her breaths quickened, chest rising and falling, but not with surrender. Bracing herself against the headboard, she pressed her small hands into his chest, halting him just inches away. Her hair, freshly bound but now half-loosened, spilled ink-like across the white expanse of the pillows. Her robe, loosened from the struggle, teased at revealing what lay beneath.

“Julian!” Her voice sliced through, sharp and poised but tinged with alarm.

Julian’s gaze burned as it locked onto her face. Whatever he saw there—defiance, resistance, something more—only spurred him on. His mouth found hers in a kiss like a storm’s first strike, insistent and impossible to ignore. His body, taut with coiled energy, pressed down. The air between them crackled with perilous intensity.

Julian was a man too far gone to back away now.

Chapter 2 Julian, Let's Get Divorced

Francesca felt nothing but loathing.

When a woman turns cold, the man inevitably grows disenchanted.

—How disappointing.

Julian's dark hair glistened with sweat, his face tinged with a thin flush. His voice, husky and restrained, carried a trace of disbelief. ""Why won't you?""

Francesca lay on the pristine white pillow, her head tilted back to study him—the man she had pursued for four relentless years.

She was tired; tired to her core. And for once, she wanted to live for herself.

But Julian, oblivious to the weight of her exhaustion, pressed on. He demanded to know why she refused to fulfill her conjugal duties, why she wouldn't cooperate to bear him a legitimate heir, an instrument for consolidating his endless pursuit of power.

She reached out, her fingers grazing his cheek with a gentleness at odds with the words she spoke. ""Julian, let's get divorced.""

His expression darkened.

Still, he reined in his temper and spoke calmly, as if negotiating terms. ""This is because of Beatrice, isn't it? I've told you—she's just a distant relative. If her presence in the house bothers you, I've already made arrangements to move her elsewhere.""

Francesca's lips curled into a bitter smile. A distant relative? Yet she deserved her own villa? And walking arm-in-arm had become a norm?

She didn't voice these thoughts. Dignity forbade her from stooping that low.

Instead, she opened the small drawer beside the bed, pulling out a prepared divorce agreement and sliding it into his hands with deliberate ease. Her tone was light, almost casual. ""I’ll take half of your savings, the properties—and half of the Rowan shares.""

Julian's brows furrowed deeply. ""Half of Rowan? Your appetite is excessive, Mrs. Hale.""

His words were laced with mockery, the quintessential tone of a man pondering profit margins. That calculating edge, so characteristic of him, struck her through.

Francesca felt as though ice had settled in her chest.

But she didn’t regret her demand.

She’d given all she could to this mirage of a marriage. And now? She could let it all go.

Suppressing her frustration, she opted for measured reasoning. She even framed her argument from his perspective. ""Once we're divorced, you can give your heart’s desire a proper title. As for me—I’ll walk away with my share of Rowan. We both get what we want. Isn’t that ideal?""

Her demeanor carried the weight of absolute conviction.

Julian gazed back at her, his dark eyes fathomless, as if they could consume her entirely.

For a long moment, he said nothing. Then, his voice emerged cold, serrated with finality. ""Rid yourself of this notion. Francesca, there will be no divorce. We’re business partners—it’s that simple. This should be perfectly clear to you.""

Of course it was clear.

But clarity had soured into disgust.

Her silence stretched, a quiet refusal that stoked his irritation. In a sharp gesture, he grabbed a robe from the foot of the bed and stalked toward the guest room.

She needed time to reconsider. That stubborn woman, he thought. By tomorrow, Francesca would remember how much she enjoyed being Mrs. Hale—reigning one step beneath him at Rowan, basking in that heady aura of control.

He smirked. Francesca was always like this.

Behind him, her voice floated in the dim space, unbearably soft, almost reminiscent of the Francesca he’d married four long years ago. ""Julian, can’t we part on good terms? I don’t want to do this anymore.""

His body stiffened mid-step.

For the first time in years, he returned to the bedside. Standing over her, he said evenly, ""From the day you married me, you knew there would be no room for love in the Hale family. You won’t get it from me, Francesca, and you’d be a fool to want it. Chasing illusions will only make your life harder.""

He swept his hand toward the bed.

The thick stack of papers scattered like snowflakes, fluttering to the carpet below.

\*\*\*\*\*

At precisely eight in the morning, Julian descended the staircase, cutting an impeccable figure in a black-and-white suit that fit him like a second skin, every line tailored to his lean form. He looked—imposingly—perfect.

He was in fine spirits until he entered the silent, empty dining room.

Picking up his coffee, he took a slow sip before asking, seemingly offhand, ""Where’s the madam?""

The staff, all too aware of last night’s heated argument, tread carefully. One ventured an answer, voice subdued, ""The madam left for the office early. Didn’t eat breakfast. She drove herself—refused the chauffeur.""

The coffee cup hit the saucer with a sharp clink.

Suddenly, he found himself entirely devoid of appetite.

\*\*\*\*\*

Thirty minutes later, Julian arrived at Rowan Group headquarters.

His secretary, Laura, was already waiting in the parking garage, poised and efficient. She stepped forward to open his car door as he came to a smooth stop.

Julian stepped out, his long fingers deftly buttoning his suit jacket as he strode toward the elevator. Every movement exuded understated authority, his presence drawing covert glances from several female employees loitering nearby.

Once inside the private elevator, Laura lowered her voice as the doors slid closed. ""Regarding the Meridian project—Ms. Ward has inserted one of her own into the team.""

Julian’s gaze remained fixed on the glowing red numbers climbing upward.

After a moment, he chuckled, a sharp, biting sound. ""She’s learning to play the game. Interesting.""

During the board meeting, Julian and Francesca clashed.

The two were husband and wife, and Francesca’s sharp business acumen was something Julian had meticulously mentored her in. Their quarrel played out like a theater piece—thrilling and impossible to look away from, leaving the mid- and upper-tier executives of Rowan Group thoroughly riveted.

By the time the meeting ended, dusk was settling in.

Francesca returned to her office, collapsing into the leather sofa with a deliberate heaviness. She pressed her fingertips to her temples, massaging away the ache that had taken root there.

Annie entered quietly, setting a glass of water on the coffee table. “Mr. Hale’s personal attorney called,” she said softly. “He’d like to meet with you in the café on the first floor. Should I decline?”

Francesca’s brow arched, though her demeanor stayed composed. “Grant Jenkins?”

Grant Jenkins—a name that carried unmatched weight in legal circles, a towering figure in the profession.

His firm, Blackletter Law, ruled the field with its unshakable authority. But beyond his professional acclaim, Grant had another role: he was Julian’s shadow operative, someone who handled matters too delicate or unsavory for Julian to touch directly.

Their relationship was entrenched, a network of mutual benefit and loyalty too tangled to unravel.

To put it bluntly, Julian could divorce Francesca but would never sever ties with Grant. The fact that Julian had dispatched him now was clear—he wanted to keep their impending divorce out of the public eye.

Francesca mulled it over and finally agreed to the meeting.

My friend “Carly” dated someone named “John”. Carly and John lasted for about nine months, but their relationship was TERRIBLE. John was self-centered and would never give Carly the time of day, guilt-trip, lie, fake self-harm himself so that Carly would go back to him, etc; 


Recently, our friend “Maya” went to get all three of us coffee at a local shop. Maya saw John at the coffee shop and started speaking to him about life and how they were doing. Maya told Carly and I about it and we didn’t really think much of it because we live in the same small town. Until, Maya calls me and tells me she has a crush on John and that they have been talking since they exchanged numbers…. FIVE DAYS AGO!!!!!!!!! I was flabbergasted. Maya knows ALL about what happened between him and Carly so WHY?? would she go and do that. She said, and I quote, “Well it shouldn’t matter I just wont tell her, and when we don’t have lunch with Carly we can just invite him over.” Yeah. Immediately after she said that Carly called me to complain about what was going on. 


Carly spoke to me about how she felt and how she doesn’t care if they date, but she doesn’t want Maya to get hurt and start to lose herself since she already struggles mentally. I knew I couldn’t let this happen so I invited both of them to a dinner nearby. I opened the conversation and spoke to them both individually on how the other person felt. And Maya just slaps me and says that she can’t believe that I would do something like this and air her out like that in-front of Carly. I started to cry because I was abused as a young child and that slap triggered me. Carly stayed with me and we went home and just laid on the floor. 


So, am I the asshole for trying to talk about this maturely to both of my ADULT friends?

(**💡** [**Check out the full guide**](https://www.aiarty.com/ai-video-generator/veo-3-prompt.htm?ttref=w1bl-xxx-r2511261) to master the 5-Part Veo Prompt Formula, and access advanced tips for creating stunning cinematic videos.)

**The Veo 3/3.1 Prompt Formula:**

1. **\[Cinematography\]:** Define the camera work and shot type. (e.g., *wide shot, aerial drone view, slow zoom-in, cinematic close-up*).
2. **\[Subject\]:** Detail the main focus (person, object, or creature) including appearance, clothing, and mood.
3. **\[Action\]:** State what is happening. (e.g., *walking through a street, pouring coffee in slow motion*).
4. **\[Context\]:** Specify the setting. (e.g., *rainy city at night, sunset beach, abandoned warehouse with flickering lights*).
5. **\[Style & Ambiance\]:** Add the visual and emotional tone. (e.g., *film noir, moody blue tones, soft lighting, vintage color grade*).

**Example Prompt That Uses All 5 Parts:**

>A medium shot of a young woman in a red jacket walking through a rainy Tokyo street at night, neon lights reflecting on wet pavement, captured in cinematic 24fps, soft focus with warm highlights, accompanied by ambient city sounds and distant traffic noise.

**Pro Tips for Maximizing Your Output**

* **Go Further:** You can extend the structure by adding Dialogue, Sound cues (e.g., *ocean waves crashing*), and, most importantly, Negative Prompts (e.g., *no subtitles, no text overlays, no distortion*) for finer control.
* **Use Generators:** If you struggle with the detailed descriptions, tools like the Veo Prompt Generator (OCDevel) or Superprompt can help you structure your basic idea into a complete, professional prompt.",1,1764127558.0,Aiarty,0,1.0,False

After months of building, testing, breaking, rebuilding (and drinking probably too much coffee), I’m finally sharing something I’ve been working on: **TextForge**, a floating toolbox that pops up the moment you select text on any webpage.

No tabs. No switching windows. No copy-paste circus.

Just **select text** and a full suite of AI and productivity tools appears right on your page.

# 🔥 What it does

* Rewrite, summarize, explain, extract key points
* Generate smart titles
* Sort lists, remove duplicates, solve simple math
* Open all links in a selection
* Clean formatting
* Add bold/italic/strike
* Convert case, remove accents
* Save snippets to history
* Even edit the text *directly on the page*

# 💡 Why I built it

I kept running into the same friction every day… selecting text, moving it somewhere else, running it through a tool, pasting it back.  
So I thought: *why not bring all the tools to the text instead?*

That became the core idea behind TextForge.

If you want to check it out, here are the links to the extension and to my personal page. Feedback is genuinely welcome, I’m still improving it and every suggestion helps.

""My husband meet a woman in secret.

I sat in the backseat of an expensive town car, my expression calm as I quietly watched.

The girl was young— They were passionately kissing.""

---

Chapter 1 Her Husband Keeps a Mistress

At the entrance of a luxury villa in Kingsward Fringe, Francesca Ward sat in the backseat of an expensive town car, her expression calm as she quietly watched her husband meet a woman in secret.

The girl was young—a vision in a simple white dress, the very picture of innocence and charm.

They held hands, their body language telling an intimate story. Lovers, unmistakably.

Francesca's husband, Julian Hale, had a softness in his eyes she hadn't seen in years.

The girl tilted her delicate face up at him, her tone almost petulant. “My feet hurt, Julian. Carry me!”

Francesca braced herself, certain that Julian would refuse. He was notorious for his aloof demeanor, his temper as cold and sharp as glass. No matter how favored a new lover might be, she couldn’t imagine him indulging such childish whims.

But in the next moment, Francesca’s certainty shattered.

Julian brushed his finger gently against the girl’s small nose, an oddly restrained tenderness in his movement. Without a word, he lifted her effortlessly into his arms.

She nestled into him, her pale hands finding their place at the back of his neck, her touch tracing lazily down the dark strands of his hair.

Francesca’s gaze snagged on the faint red mark at the nape of Julian’s neck. A birthmark—a blood-red freckle more sensual in its placement than it should have been. She remembered the heat of his reaction the single time she’d grazed it unintentionally, his frustration and control unraveling into something harsh, something unyielding.

Now that same man leaned against the pillar of the garden pavilion with this girl cradled against him, his eyes lit with undisguised desire.

Francesca drew her own eyes shut. She didn’t want to see anymore.

Julian was an image of reckless passion she had never known. This wasn’t the man she had married.

When she opened her eyes again, there was no trace of emotion—no anger, no affection, no pain. Just a void where feeling used to be.

Love, after all, could disappear. And when it did, only practicalities remained.

The villa where Julian whispered sweet nothings to his mistress? That, Francesca noted dryly, was marital property. Jointly owned.

She wouldn’t let a pair of shameless lovers make a mockery of her. Speaking calmly, she addressed her secretary in the front seat. “Annie, has he been with her consistently these last three months?”

Annie’s reply was brisk and certain. “The girl’s name is Beatrice Caldwell. She’s something of a childhood sweetheart. Three months ago, Mr. Hale pulled strings to place her in the company, and since then, he’s been exceptionally protective of her.”

She handed Francesca a thick dossier. Francesca leafed through it languidly. She supposed she could grant their wish for legitimacy.

But Julian would need to pay. Half the marital property, nothing less. Francesca would take the money and the shares, walk away—clean, decisive.

Outside, the autumn leaves gleamed golden under the glow of a sinking sun. The light spangled its edges, dazzling, almost unbearably bright.

Francesca composed herself, then dialed Julian’s number.

It rang several times before he picked up, his voice clipped and cold. “What is it?”

She lowered her lashes. “It’s my birthday today. Will you be coming home for dinner?”

A pause. Brief, but telling. A hesitant silence where Julian undoubtedly calculated excuses. Business dinners, unavoidable appointments—he had an arsenal of justifications ready.

But Francesca caught the faintest echo of a girl’s voice in the background, sweet and coy. “Julian, are you done yet? You’re not allowed to talk to her anymore…”

The line faltered. Julian cleared his throat, his tone colder when he spoke again. “If there’s nothing urgent, I’ll hang up now.”

The low buzz of a disconnected call. Francesca wasn’t surprised; Julian had always been brisk, efficient, immune to unnecessary sentiment.

Annie fumed from the front seat. “That man! He’s—unbelievable! He even forgot—”

Francesca gave the briefest pause but wasn’t perturbed. Instead, a sardonic thought flickered in her mind: Apologies for interrupting Mr. Hale’s courtship of his young mistress. What else could she do? As the legal Mrs. Hale, she was feeling decidedly displeased tonight.

She let a faint smile ghost across her lips. “He hasn’t forgotten. He simply doesn’t care. Annie, contact the utilities and have the water, electricity, and gas to this villa shut off. Let’s see if that brings him home.”

Annie gave a low laugh, unable to suppress her admiration. “You’re brilliant, Mrs. Hale.”

Francesca didn’t reply. Her gaze drifted to the car window, to the tapestry of the twilight—molten light spilling into the seams of gathering clouds.

She remembered another sunset, years ago. A night washed in gold and promises. She had asked Julian then, playfully but earnestly: Do you think our marriage will last forever?

And he’d kissed her temple, his voice warm—almost solemn. Of course, Fran. You’re the most important thing in the world to me.

Most important, she mused bitterly now, until she’d become expendable. The value of things became clearer with time—and it appeared the only thing worth holding onto was money.

A single tear slid down her face, silent and unwelcome.

\*\*\*\*\*

When Francesca returned to their marital home at Crowncrest Court, sunset fully bled into dusk. Half an hour later, Annie delivered the divorce papers.

Francesca’s demands were simple: half of everything.

She slipped into the bath, letting warmth ease into her bones. Afterward, dressed and ready to move on with the evening, she hesitated. Something idle and unbidden propelled her back to the full-length mirror. She let the crisp white bathrobe slide off her shoulders until her reflection stared back, bare and unflinchingly honest beneath the gleam of the chandelier.

Years of strain marked her body with an elegance that was lean but unforgiving. Her ivory skin retained a cool, refined beauty, but the softer curves had given way to the demands of time, effort, and endurance.

And wasn’t that the difference. Wasn’t she the difference. Her gaze turned darker as fleeting images of Julian and Beatrice—Julian’s hands on her, their fevered, unrestrained intimacy—played cruelly in her mind.

It had to be different with her. Rawer, wilder—more alive than the measured, tempered rhythm she and Julian had fallen into long ago.

A flicker of shame passed over her face, and she frowned, disgusted by her own willingness to compare.

Francesca tightened the robe across her chest, turned from the mirror, and left the room without looking back.

The door to the walk-in closet creaked open—softly, deliberately.

Julian was back.

He stood there at the threshold, his presence filling the space with quiet authority. The tailored black shirt and sharp slacks sculpted his tall, lean frame, the sleek fabric hinting at power without showiness. In the bright, diffused light, the angular contours of his face exuded the intoxicating allure of a man who had long since mastered the art of unobtainable charm.

Francesca couldn't help but think: Even without the billions to his name, Julian alone—just looking like that—would draw a legion of women ready to lose themselves in him, no questions asked.

She had shared his bed for four years. That alone, she thought dryly, wasn’t the worst bargain.

Their eyes met with uncanny precision, a brief, wordless transaction. Something passed between them, something neither bothered to say aloud.

Julian stepped further into the room. His movements were unhurried, the predator’s deliberate grace. Soon, he came to a halt behind Francesca, close enough for their reflections to mingle in the full-length mirror. She had finished dressing—her robe smoothed and fastened with clinical perfection, her cascading black hair now swept into an immaculate twist. Even fresh out of the shower, she emanated the steel veneer of a woman impossible to unsettle. A queen armored in surface poise.

Yet Julian’s gaze lingered, his silence thick with some ineffable tension. He remembered—vividly—how different she’d been on their wedding night. Slightly vulnerable, delicate even.

Vulnerable enough to tremble under his gaze, as if proximity alone left her skimming the edge of fear.

That night, nothing had happened between them.

Two weeks later, when a business crisis had blindsided him, it was Francesca who had lain trembling in his arms, whispering his name. He’d held her tightly, ferociously, that night, and it was then they had consummated their marriage—truly become husband and wife.

They had, each of them, been the other’s first.

But in the years since, those moments of intimacy had grown scarce. Rarer still was anything resembling surrender from her. At home, she was the unassailable Mrs. Hale; at Rowan Group, she was the unflinching Ms. Ward, wielding authority with a deftness few dared to challenge. And on the rare nights when their hours converged, and they were close enough for such entanglements—bed was no different. Francesca remained distant, remote, disciplined. Even there, she held herself. Julian could swear she had never once let go—not fully, not utterly. Forget abandon; she hadn’t dared to indulge, even passingly.

Over time, he had grown bored of it.

Now, a faint smile pulled at his lips—a flicker of sardonic humor, of provocation. “You’re the one who had the power shut off at the villa, right?” he murmured, the teasing lightness edged with taunt. He stepped closer, his reflection beside hers in the glass. “Just because I gave a little attention to the daughter of a… mentor figure—’care and concern for the younger generation,’ that’s all it was—and suddenly I’ve disgraced you?”

Francesca didn’t flinch. Her gaze held Julian’s in the mirror, cool and immovable.

He let the silence stretch long enough to savor. Then, his mind caught onto something else. He traced the dates in his head, calculating quickly. A knowing glimmer lit his eyes.

Her ovulation period.

Julian leaned in, close enough that the heat of his breath brushed the curve of her ear. Lightly, his fingers grazed the slope of her earlobe before his lips followed with a whispered tease: “Is this celebration really about my birthday? Or is it about… another need? Mrs. Hale, is it that strong at twenty-six?” His voice dipped, ridded with wicked amusement.

The words were insolent, but Francesca didn’t need him to clarify his intent. She knew exactly what he wanted.

A child.

The patriarch of the Hale family still controlled ten percent of Rowan Group shares. A grandchild would cement Julian’s position, solidify his hand.

But what Julian didn’t know… was how unlikely a child was for them now.

She looked down, her lashes casting shadows against her cheekbones. Pain flickered briefly across her features—a private ache buried quickly, masked behind cool composure.

Julian’s interest, however, had shifted unmistakably. He leaned in closer now, his intentions unmistakable, his hands anchoring her waist with ease. Before Francesca could withdraw, he scooped her into his arms.

She stiffened instantly as he carried her with practiced strength into their bedroom, laying her atop the impossibly soft sheets of their sprawling bed. His weight pressed down with deliberate purpose, a predator’s focus.

But she wasn’t going to make it easy for him.

Her breaths quickened, chest rising and falling, but not with surrender. Bracing herself against the headboard, she pressed her small hands into his chest, halting him just inches away. Her hair, freshly bound but now half-loosened, spilled ink-like across the white expanse of the pillows. Her robe, loosened from the struggle, teased at revealing what lay beneath.

“Julian!” Her voice sliced through, sharp and poised but tinged with alarm.

Julian’s gaze burned as it locked onto her face. Whatever he saw there—defiance, resistance, something more—only spurred him on. His mouth found hers in a kiss like a storm’s first strike, insistent and impossible to ignore. His body, taut with coiled energy, pressed down. The air between them crackled with perilous intensity.

Julian was a man too far gone to back away now.

Chapter 2 Julian, Let's Get Divorced

Francesca felt nothing but loathing.

When a woman turns cold, the man inevitably grows disenchanted.

—How disappointing.

Julian's dark hair glistened with sweat, his face tinged with a thin flush. His voice, husky and restrained, carried a trace of disbelief. ""Why won't you?""

Francesca lay on the pristine white pillow, her head tilted back to study him—the man she had pursued for four relentless years.

She was tired; tired to her core. And for once, she wanted to live for herself.

But Julian, oblivious to the weight of her exhaustion, pressed on. He demanded to know why she refused to fulfill her conjugal duties, why she wouldn't cooperate to bear him a legitimate heir, an instrument for consolidating his endless pursuit of power.

She reached out, her fingers grazing his cheek with a gentleness at odds with the words she spoke. ""Julian, let's get divorced.""

His expression darkened.

Still, he reined in his temper and spoke calmly, as if negotiating terms. ""This is because of Beatrice, isn't it? I've told you—she's just a distant relative. If her presence in the house bothers you, I've already made arrangements to move her elsewhere.""

Francesca's lips curled into a bitter smile. A distant relative? Yet she deserved her own villa? And walking arm-in-arm had become a norm?

She didn't voice these thoughts. Dignity forbade her from stooping that low.

Instead, she opened the small drawer beside the bed, pulling out a prepared divorce agreement and sliding it into his hands with deliberate ease. Her tone was light, almost casual. ""I’ll take half of your savings, the properties—and half of the Rowan shares.""

Julian's brows furrowed deeply. ""Half of Rowan? Your appetite is excessive, Mrs. Hale.""

His words were laced with mockery, the quintessential tone of a man pondering profit margins. That calculating edge, so characteristic of him, struck her through.

Francesca felt as though ice had settled in her chest.

But she didn’t regret her demand.

She’d given all she could to this mirage of a marriage. And now? She could let it all go.

Suppressing her frustration, she opted for measured reasoning. She even framed her argument from his perspective. ""Once we're divorced, you can give your heart’s desire a proper title. As for me—I’ll walk away with my share of Rowan. We both get what we want. Isn’t that ideal?""

Her demeanor carried the weight of absolute conviction.

Julian gazed back at her, his dark eyes fathomless, as if they could consume her entirely.

For a long moment, he said nothing. Then, his voice emerged cold, serrated with finality. ""Rid yourself of this notion. Francesca, there will be no divorce. We’re business partners—it’s that simple. This should be perfectly clear to you.""

Of course it was clear.

But clarity had soured into disgust.

Her silence stretched, a quiet refusal that stoked his irritation. In a sharp gesture, he grabbed a robe from the foot of the bed and stalked toward the guest room.

She needed time to reconsider. That stubborn woman, he thought. By tomorrow, Francesca would remember how much she enjoyed being Mrs. Hale—reigning one step beneath him at Rowan, basking in that heady aura of control.

He smirked. Francesca was always like this.

Behind him, her voice floated in the dim space, unbearably soft, almost reminiscent of the Francesca he’d married four long years ago. ""Julian, can’t we part on good terms? I don’t want to do this anymore.""

His body stiffened mid-step.

For the first time in years, he returned to the bedside. Standing over her, he said evenly, ""From the day you married me, you knew there would be no room for love in the Hale family. You won’t get it from me, Francesca, and you’d be a fool to want it. Chasing illusions will only make your life harder.""

He swept his hand toward the bed.

The thick stack of papers scattered like snowflakes, fluttering to the carpet below.

\*\*\*\*\*

At precisely eight in the morning, Julian descended the staircase, cutting an impeccable figure in a black-and-white suit that fit him like a second skin, every line tailored to his lean form. He looked—imposingly—perfect.

He was in fine spirits until he entered the silent, empty dining room.

Picking up his coffee, he took a slow sip before asking, seemingly offhand, ""Where’s the madam?""

The staff, all too aware of last night’s heated argument, tread carefully. One ventured an answer, voice subdued, ""The madam left for the office early. Didn’t eat breakfast. She drove herself—refused the chauffeur.""

The coffee cup hit the saucer with a sharp clink.

Suddenly, he found himself entirely devoid of appetite.

\*\*\*\*\*

Thirty minutes later, Julian arrived at Rowan Group headquarters.

His secretary, Laura, was already waiting in the parking garage, poised and efficient. She stepped forward to open his car door as he came to a smooth stop.

Julian stepped out, his long fingers deftly buttoning his suit jacket as he strode toward the elevator. Every movement exuded understated authority, his presence drawing covert glances from several female employees loitering nearby.

Once inside the private elevator, Laura lowered her voice as the doors slid closed. ""Regarding the Meridian project—Ms. Ward has inserted one of her own into the team.""

Julian’s gaze remained fixed on the glowing red numbers climbing upward.

After a moment, he chuckled, a sharp, biting sound. ""She’s learning to play the game. Interesting.""

During the board meeting, Julian and Francesca clashed.

The two were husband and wife, and Francesca’s sharp business acumen was something Julian had meticulously mentored her in. Their quarrel played out like a theater piece—thrilling and impossible to look away from, leaving the mid- and upper-tier executives of Rowan Group thoroughly riveted.

By the time the meeting ended, dusk was settling in.

Francesca returned to her office, collapsing into the leather sofa with a deliberate heaviness. She pressed her fingertips to her temples, massaging away the ache that had taken root there.

Annie entered quietly, setting a glass of water on the coffee table. “Mr. Hale’s personal attorney called,” she said softly. “He’d like to meet with you in the café on the first floor. Should I decline?”

Francesca’s brow arched, though her demeanor stayed composed. “Grant Jenkins?”

Grant Jenkins—a name that carried unmatched weight in legal circles, a towering figure in the profession.

His firm, Blackletter Law, ruled the field with its unshakable authority. But beyond his professional acclaim, Grant had another role: he was Julian’s shadow operative, someone who handled matters too delicate or unsavory for Julian to touch directly.

Their relationship was entrenched, a network of mutual benefit and loyalty too tangled to unravel.

To put it bluntly, Julian could divorce Francesca but would never sever ties with Grant. The fact that Julian had dispatched him now was clear—he wanted to keep their impending divorce out of the public eye.

Francesca mulled it over and finally agreed to the meeting.

Ten minutes later, she descended to the first floor via her private elevator and stepped into the café.

2045年春天，我父母开着一辆老旧的燃油车，在去西宁的路上冲出了悬崖。在这个大部分车辆已被统一调度的时代，这本身就很奇怪。

调查报告结论干脆利落：天气恶劣，驾驶员失误。

五年了。我依然住在他们留下的旧公寓里，仿佛他们只是又一次漫长的出差。这段记忆像根细刺，五年间一直扎在我记忆的角落，疼，且无法忽略。



2050年秋，来自“全球转型期档案研究所”的研究员，艾米丽·陈博士，联系到我。她希望就我父母的生平进行一系列口述史访谈。 

我的父母是再普通不过的人，这段被时间冲刷得模糊的往事，有何价值？但我还是接受了采访，也许我只是想找个人聊聊那段记忆。



***CHAPTER1 困惑的开端***



艾米丽·陈博士按响门铃的瞬间，我家门的智能表面泛起一阵水波状的认证流光。2050年的上海，天空是“净土”系统渲染出的、一种符合大众心理健康指数的标准蔚蓝。楼下是由系统统一调度的城市运输单元，它们以精确到毫秒的间隔滑行，像一颗颗银色磁粒。

她是一位让人看不出确切年龄的亚裔女性，身着的衣物呈现出一种中性的灰色。她佩戴着镜腿极细的智能眼镜，镜片滚动着加密数据流。

我们相对坐在客厅，空气净化系统释放负离子，模拟雨林的气息。我小口啜饮着她带来的合成茶，根据我的心率、皮电反应实时微调成分的饮品，龙井风味，但咽下后舌根留下一丝难以名状的、属于营养基质的空白感。



空气中几乎无法察觉的低频嗡鸣，提示着这套系统永恒的劳作。

陈：李先生，感谢您的时间。我的研究致力于收集21世纪20至40年代，大转型时期被遗忘的个体记忆。您的父母，李玉先生和陈婷女士，是我们感兴趣的对象。

李：我理解。但他们是非常普通的两个人。我不确定能提供什么有价值的信息……尤其是关于那场意外。

陈： 我们不妨从头开始。我们关注的是他们的生平，而非结局。比如2030年前后您四五岁时，关于家最早的记忆是什么？任何细节都好。

李：很温暖……安全，印象里父母很相爱。我父亲是程序员，母亲是外企市场经理。和当时上海成千上万的中产家庭没什么不同。我父亲……他有个很大的显示器，上面总是跑着代码，他喜欢一些老掉牙的东西，《星际穿越》什么的，有时也会和我一起看。我记得他喜欢打英雄联盟，一个很吵闹的游戏。

陈：陈婷女士呢？

李：我母亲更……时髦些？她很忙，但回家总会给我带点小东西，一块蛋糕，或者她公司的新奇样品。他们都是1999年生的，比我许多同龄人的父母都要……开放，对，更平等。

陈：她的语言能力如何？

李：很好。不，是相当好。除了英语，她还能说一些尼泊尔语、简单的俄语。她甚至知道中亚几个地区的口音差别。我曾问她为何学这些，她说“和国外客户喝酒时用得上”。她还教过我不少，但我大多忘了。

陈：我们注意到，她多次前往尼泊尔加德满都的行程，与当地一些文化交流团体的活动时间高度重合。您对此有印象吗？

李：这个我不清楚。我只记得她出差很频繁，目的地有时会让我觉得奇怪。

陈： 2035年左右，全球经济进入“静默萧条期”。家里的氛围有变化吗？他们会讨论一些……不那么轻松的话题吗？

李里： 氛围还算平和吧，父亲更忙了，常熬夜。他说在做一个很重要但让人不舒服的项目。母亲好像不那么意气风发了，变得有点奇怪。我记得她从不让我在电话里问“爸爸什么时候回家”，要问“爸爸东西买好了吗？”我一直以为那是想要掌控一切的职业习惯。

陈： 很有意思。您父亲李玉先生，据我们了解，在华方科技任职期间，曾参与过一些相当重要的基础设施项目。他在家会聊工作吗？哪怕只是只言片语？

李： 重要的项目？他从没提起。我一直以为他做的是比较基础的后端开发。他下班后就是看看电影，玩玩游戏，他是个很……居家的人。

陈：您记得家里有什么特别的习惯吗？比如，定期旅行，或者有固定的访客？

李：旅行很少，他们没时间。但常有些年轻的叔叔阿姨来，世界各地的人都有。他们会喝酒，聊天，声音压得很低。我很喜欢他们，因为他们总会给我带些小礼物。

访谈结束时，陈博士起身，看似随意地补充了一句。

陈： 那辆冲下悬崖的车，是手动档的老式燃油车。在2045年很罕见，不是吗？选择它，或许正是因为……它难以被追踪和调度。



门在我身后关上。客厅里，只剩下空气净化系统那永恒的、低沉的嗡鸣。我突然觉得，这声音比以前更响了一些。







*CHAPTER2 渐深的迷雾*



一周后，陈博士如约而至。雨水被建筑表面的静电疏水层排斥，形成一颗颗完美球体，无声滚落。窗外天际线被飞行器航道的光带重新勾勒。

同事们的身影在磨砂玻璃隔断后模糊地移动，我下意识地看了一眼紧闭的办公室门，尽管我知道这里的隐私级别无可挑剔。

陈：李先生，我带来了一些影像和数据资料。这些符号，您有印象吗？

李：哦，这个包我记得。好像是某个区块链大会的赠品，估计是父亲从展会带回来的吧，现在没人玩这个了。我母亲出差常背。

陈：区块链……那段历史很短暂。加密货币在2032年的战争后，因主权监管和能耗问题彻底崩溃。李玉先生在技术论坛上对相关数据丑闻发表过尖锐批评。

李：啊？他没跟我说过这些。他……是个很温和的人，我很难把他和批评、丑闻这类词联系起来。

陈：温和的人，有时原则最坚定。您看这个。这是一份关于算法偏见的分析，署名LY，日期是2038年冬。与您父亲参与的“净土·语义筛选”项目有关。

李： LY……这能确定是我父亲？

陈： LY确实是常见缩写，但我们有间接证据。嗯，2035年，科技冷战初期，您十岁左右，家庭氛围有变化吗？

李： 父亲好像更忙了，我母亲也很焦虑。他书房的门常关着，母亲有时会端着咖啡在门口站很久，却不进去。就好像……门后面有什么让她害怕的东西。

陈： 那时国际关系持续紧张，数字主权成为共识。李玉先生所在的华方科技承接了更多官方战略项目。陈婷女士所在的外企则感受到越来越大的压力。他们两位，恰好处于风暴的中心。

李： 是，我母亲那时薪资似乎停滞了，但父亲收入不错，家庭生活水平没受什么影响。

陈： 谢谢，这些信息很有帮助。今天先到这里吧。

她离开得依然干脆，但这次，她在门口停顿了一下，回头看了我一眼，那眼神复杂，似乎混合着同情和……警告。







*CHAPTER3 净化过的记忆*



第三次访谈，在我父母的旧居进行。我依然住在这里，仿佛一个守墓人。客厅很小，极简风格的家具泛着冷光。对，IKEA，现在已经买不到了。书架一角，是几本父母留下的纸质书，书页边缘卷曲，像干枯的树叶。

等待陈博士时，一段记忆浮现。那是个寻常晚上，就在这个沙发上，刚看完《蜘蛛侠》的父亲用彼得·帕克的台词对我说：“能力越大，责任越大，里里。”那时他在一家后来成为巨头的科技公司做工程师。他对技术充满好奇，但也常和母亲讨论科技伦理。他说：“最好的工具不该试图模仿人，而应帮助人成为更完整的人。”母亲则会忧心忡忡地回应：“玉，你那个数据过滤的项目，我总觉得不安。它好像在……学习不该学习的东西。”父亲会拍拍她的手，声音疲惫：“别担心，我只是在做技术优化。我这种底层员工，能有什么危险？”

为什么这段回忆此刻如此清晰？屋内的恒温系统维持在26度，我却感到一阵寒意。

*地点：上海，青浦，李里公寓*



陈： 李先生，我们找到了一个AR眼镜。最后修改日期是2045年4月10日，您父母出发旅行的前三天。可能是李玉先生的遗物。

李：陈博士，在查看之前，我需要背景。您一直暗示我父母并非普通人，但我对此一无所知。你到底在调查什么？

陈： 您知道，2025年后的二十年，是一个用数据、算法和资本重新划界的过程。互联网曾象征连接，但后来，数字主权成为共识。西方由Meta-Google联盟主导“元宇宙公约”，我们则构建了“协同网络”，以华方的“净土系统”为基石。

李： 嗯，这已是完成状态了。所有人都生活在其中。

陈： 但建造过程并非一帆风顺。李先生，您了解“回声运动”吗？

李： 我听说过这个名字，我中学时的事。好像是一场……网络上失败的思想运动？

陈： 嗯。这是一场试图在两大体系间建立暗桥的全球性尝试，被学术界称为“数字布拉格之春”。参与者相信，技术和思想不应被数字墙隔绝。运动初期，一些核心的技术批判文章与内部信息，指向一个代号为LY的华方内部人士。

李：……这不可能。他为什么要这么做？

陈： 也许因为良知。他在参与搭建的“净土”语义筛选模块，最初承诺是用于过滤恶意信息，但很快，它的功能扩展了……用于‘净化’不和谐的记忆，进行大规模、精细化的舆情引导。而您的母亲陈婷女士，我们相信她的代号是“观察者T”。她极可能利用外企市场经理的身份和频繁的海外行程，在两大阵营之间传递无法通过数字网络发送的实体数据。这是当时唯一可靠的方式。我们后来发现，她那家国际品牌的多位高管，与各方关系复杂。

李：……

陈：他们的车祸发生在从华方青海数据中心返回的路上。

李： 所以他们的车祸……不是意外。

陈： 我们没有确凿证据证明那不是意外。档案研究所只负责收集历史碎片。这个眼镜，或许能提供一些当时的碎片。它处于离线状态很久了。







*CHAPTER4 系统的注视*



陈博士离开时，将那个陈旧的AR眼镜轻轻放在茶几上。在我手指接触到它的一瞬间，家庭网络发出提示音：“检测到未认证的离线历史设备。”

2050年的夜晚，窗外是“净土”系统调节下、永远不会完全漆黑的天空。

我走到书桌前，桌面感应亮起。我唤醒个人终端，打开境内唯一被授权使用的搜索引擎。

输入“回声 运动”。

页面几乎瞬间刷新，返回提示：“请求已记录。根据《数字净化法案》第11条，该关键词需要系统管理员以上访问权限。”

尝试“LY”、“净土 早期 争议”、“陈婷 观察者T”。

结果很少，或提示“部分结果未予显示”。搜索父亲的名字，只关联到标准职业履历和那则公司内部的简短讣告。

我坐在那里，房间的自适应光环境感知到我的长时间静默，悄然切换到了节能休眠”

模式，黑暗缓缓吞噬了我。



我坐在那里，很久。



“检测到非常规心率波动。根据《用户心理健康保护条例》，需要为您预约在线心理疏导吗？”

我的意识瞬间清醒。这是一个警告。净土系统不仅在隐瞒，它还在实时监控我的困惑。



我点击了【忽略】。



几分钟的死寂。然后，客厅的主照明灯“啪”一声自动亮起，光线是审讯室般的惨白。墙壁上的环境屏保，瞬间切换成了“净土系统”的官方标志，静止不动。

“检测到安抚协议被拒绝，焦虑指数持续升高。为保障用户安全，将强制启动环境干预。”

空气净化系统突然加大功率，发出不祥的轰鸣，释放出一种宣传为有镇静效果的合成信息素。那气味甜腻、浓重，带着化学品的虚假花香，令我阵阵作呕。

这个家，这个由净土系统全方位托管的、我生活了25年的巢穴，此刻正清晰地向我表明：我是一个被寄生的宿主，而我刚刚苏醒的记忆，是它必须清除的病毒。



我失去他们的那个春天，到底发生了什么？



我戴上眼镜，没有看到任何父母的影像，只看到一行漂浮的小字：



***if\_you\_are\_reading\_this***

***system.is.lying;***

**// 去找艾米丽·陈，她是我们最后的‘回声’**



我猛地摘下眼镜，冷汗浸湿后背。就在这时，手机亮了，是陈博士发来的信息，只有四个字：

“他们来了。”





**-**

**Spring 2045.** My parents’ old, gasoline-powered car plunged off a cliff on the way to Xining. In an era where most vehicles were under unified, algorithmic dispatch, this was strange in itself.

The investigation report was succinct and clinical: **Adverse weather, driver error.**

Five years. I still live in the old apartment they left behind, as if they were simply on yet another prolonged business trip. The memory is like a fine sliver, lodged in the corner of my mind for half a decade—a pain that is impossible to ignore.

**Autumn 2050.** Dr. Emily Chen, a researcher from the ""Global Transition Period Archival Institute,"" contacted me. She hoped to conduct a series of oral history interviews about my parents’ lives.

My parents were the most ordinary people; what value could this vague, time-worn past possibly hold? Yet, I agreed to the interview. Perhaps I just wanted someone to talk to about that memory.

# CHAPTER 1 The Perplexing Beginning

The moment Dr. Emily Chen pressed the doorbell, the smart surface of my front door rippled with a wave-like authentication shimmer. In Shanghai, 2050, the sky was a standard, psychologically sound azure, rendered by the **“Pureland” System**. Below, city transport units—unified and system-dispatched—slid by at millisecond intervals, like silver magnetic particles.

She was an East Asian woman whose exact age was indeterminable, dressed in a neutral grey garment. She wore smart glasses with ultra-thin temples, their lenses scrolling with encrypted data streams.

We sat opposite each other in the living room. The air purification system released negative ions, simulating the scent of a rainforest. I took sips of the synthetic tea she brought, a drink whose composition was fine-tuned in real-time according to my heart rate and electrodermal response. It was Longjing-flavored, but after swallowing, it left a subtle, indescribable blankness on my palate—the taste of nutrient matrix.

A barely perceptible low-frequency hum in the air suggested the system’s eternal labor.

As the interview concluded, Dr. Chen stood up and added a seemingly casual remark.

**Chen:** That car that drove off the cliff was an old, manual-transmission, gasoline vehicle. Quite rare in 2045, wasn't it? Choosing it might have been precisely because... it was difficult to track and dispatch.

The door closed behind me. In the living room, only the eternal, low hum of the air purification system remained. Suddenly, I felt that sound was louder than before.

# CHAPTER 2 The Deepening Fog

A week later, Dr. Chen arrived as scheduled. Rain was repelled by the building’s electrostatic hydrophobic layer, forming perfect spheres that rolled off silently. Outside the window, the skyline was re-delineated by the light strips of the aerial transport corridors.

The vague forms of my colleagues moved behind the frosted glass partitions, and I instinctively glanced at the tightly closed office door, though I knew the privacy level here was impeccable.

She left as quickly as before, but this time, she paused at the door, looked back at me, her gaze complex, seeming to mix sympathy and... a warning.

# CHAPTER 3 The Purified Memory

The third interview took place in my parents' old home. I still live here, like a custodian of a tomb. The living room is small, the minimalist furniture gleaming with a cold light. Yes, IKEA, which can no longer be bought. In a corner of the bookshelf are a few paper books my parents left behind, their page edges curled like dry leaves.

While waiting for Dr. Chen, a memory surfaced. It was an ordinary evening, right here on this sofa. My father, who had just finished watching *Spider-Man*, quoted Peter Parker’s line to me: “With great power comes great responsibility, Lili.” At that time, he was an engineer at a tech company that would later become a giant. He was deeply curious about technology, but he often discussed tech ethics with my mother. He said, ""The best tool shouldn't try to imitate humans, but help humans become more complete."" My mother would reply worriedly, ""Yu, I always feel uneasy about your data filtering project. It seems to be... learning things it shouldn't."" My father would pat her hand, his voice tired: ""Don't worry, I'm just doing technical optimization. What danger could there be for a low-level employee like me?""

Why is this memory so vivid right now? The constant temperature system in the house maintained 26 degrees Celsius, yet I felt a chill.

# CHAPTER 4 The System’s Watch

When Dr. Chen left, she placed the old AR glasses gently on the coffee table. The moment my fingers touched it, the home network issued an alert: ""Uncertified offline historical device detected.""

In the 2050 night, the sky outside the window, regulated by the “Pureland” System, would never be completely black.

I walked to the desk, and the surface sensor lit up. I woke up my personal terminal and opened the only authorized search engine in the territory.

I typed: `Echo Movement`.

The page refreshed almost instantly, returning the prompt: **""Request recorded. According to Article 11 of the Digital Purification Act, this keyword requires System Administrator-level access.""**

I tried: `LY`, `Pureland early controversy`, `Chen Ting Observer T`.

The results were scarce or prompted: **“Some results not displayed.”** Searching my father's name only linked to his standard professional resume and a brief company internal obituary.

I sat there. The room’s adaptive lighting, sensing my prolonged silence, quietly switched to the ""energy-saving sleep"" mode, and darkness slowly swallowed me.

I sat there for a long time.

**“Unconventional heart rate fluctuation detected. According to the User Psychological Health Protection Regulation, should an online psychological consultation be scheduled for you?”**

My consciousness instantly cleared. This was a warning. The Pureland System was not just concealing; it was monitoring my confusion in real-time.

I clicked **\[Ignore\]**.

Several minutes of dead silence. Then, the main living room light “clacked” and turned on automatically, the light a stark white, like an interrogation room. The environmental screensaver on the wall instantly switched to the official logo of the “Pureland System,” static and unmoving.

**“Calm protocol rejected. Anxiety index continues to rise. To ensure user safety, environmental intervention will be forcibly activated.”**

The air purification system suddenly increased its power, emitting an ominous roar and releasing a synthetic pheromone advertised as having a sedative effect. The scent was cloyingly sweet, thick, and laced with the false floral scent of chemicals, making me feel waves of nausea.

This home, this nest where the Pureland System had fully managed my life for 25 years, was now clearly showing me: I was a parasitized host, and my newly awakened memory was the virus it had to eliminate.

What exactly happened that spring I lost them?

I put on the glasses. I saw no image of my parents, only a line of floating text:

`if_you_are_reading_this`

`system.is.lying;`

`// Find Emily Chen. She is our last 'Echo'.`

I violently tore the glasses off, cold sweat soaking my back. Just then, my phone lit up. It was a message from Dr. Chen, only four words:

**“They are coming.”**

Sometimes when you flip a switch, you can't un-flip it.

When I was 24 years old (spring/summer 2000), I was collecting and reading a lot of books on the occult, philosophy, and religion. I don't know why, I was just drawn to it, and the local used book store was (probably still is) full of that stuff. I read everything I could get my hands on. Based on some common themes among the material I read, I started trying to manifest things in my life with pure intention, and this became a habit over a few months. One morning, while I was having coffee with a friend, she drew something on a napkin and pushed it across the table to me. I asked what it was, and she said, ""It's your aura. You're on fire."" I asked, ""Is that good?"" She said, ""I'm not sure. This is just what I see."" So I asked her if she saw these a lot and she said, ""Yeah, sometimes, but not like this."" I thought, ok, weird, but that it is just her thing, not mine. But maybe it means I'm on to something.

I went through a dark time that year due to a very hurtful breakup. Emotionally, I was a wreck.

By late summer, this feeling of manifesting things was so familiar that it was just second nature. Not that it ever did anything. Until that one night. My intention invited something in when I was feeling weak, and I immediately knew that I had made a mistake. The next day, I donated all of my occult books to the public library and tried to mentally, I don't know, ""cleanse"" my thought patterns of that intention. But it was too late. By then, I had a persistent feeling that there was something *with* me. Something bigger than I was. Tall, thin, or maybe more accurately, *spindly*. Dark, shadowy, or *wispy*, always at the corner of my sight, or sometimes feeling that it was standing *right* behind me, even leaning over me, like when I was cooking. It didn't seem as bad when I was outdoors, or with a group of people. But that summer, I spent a lot of time alone. I got used to it always being there, that feeling of a thing being close. Almost like a constant fight or flight response.

Around the time I was reading the occult books, I had also started a dream journal. I had suffered from sleep paralysis (runs in the family on my mother's side). My intent was merely to remember more about my dreams (I felt this was important for some reason. Fun fact: it isn't!). This came with side effects though. While it became *much* easier to remember my dreams, it also induced lucid dreams, and eventually out of body experiences as I was trying to fall asleep. These experiences were all terrifying to me. I have a totally different wild story about that, but I don't want to get off topic. Let's just say that just because it is a lucid dream or OOBE, it doesn't mean you're the one driving.

Several nights in a row, *I saw it*, clearly, as I was on the edge of an out of body experience. By this, I mean that one moment I'm lying in bed with my eyes closed falling asleep, and the next moment I'm separated from my body by a very small distance, maybe an inch or so, and I don't have any eyes that I can close. And so I see *it* there, above me...a pitch black, somewhat shiny *thing* coalescing from, I don't know if tendrils is the right word. Maybe threads. *Strands*, that's the word. Coalescing from black strands above me. And from that, I went straight into sleep paralysis.

For three nights in a row this happened. Same experience, repeated, to the point that I didn't want to sleep, but of course I could only put sleep off for so long, working two part-time jobs and trying to get to classes in the morning. But that third night, something different happened. Right when I was on the verge of sleep paralysis, but while I was in that out of body stage, something else came in and chased the entity off. It was smaller and brighter. And instead of sleep paralysis, I sunk back into my body and slept deeply that night, waking up refreshed.

Did the entity go away? Definitely not. I could feel that it was still around, but it seemed like it would rarely try to get close after that encounter. After a few years, I had nearly forgotten about it. The out of body experiences and lucid dreams stopped, but the sleep paralysis continued as it always had.

Time passed, and I moved out of state for work, to the New Orleans area. One late night in 2003, my then-girlfriend woke me up and said, ""It's staring at you from the doorway."" Now, I hadn't told her anything about my experiences years before, but I knew exactly what she was talking about. I didn't say a word that night, but the next morning she brought it up at breakfast. She told me that she could see ""demons and angels,"" and that her grandmother could as well. She made it clear that by ""demons and angels"" she didn't necessarily mean in the Christian sense. Her family's religion was some mix of Christianity (maybe Catholic) and, I don't want to say voodoo, but that is just the closest label that comes to mind. Now that I think about it, I wonder if it even had a name - some family folk religion or something. Anyway, she pressed me about why that one was following me around. And so I told her my story. She then demanded that I see her mom so she could perform some sort of ritual on me with an old book (not a Bible, but something equivalent for them). I declined the offer. And suddenly I was single again.

A few more years pass, a number of traumatic events occurred in my life, and I fell into a deep depression. I moved back to the Midwest and started seeking again, but differently this time. Through a series of random events, I ended up participating in a really intense week-long retreat hosted by an indigenous group in Ontario. The format was based on coming of age ceremonies, and included a full week of fasting, challenges, a lot of purification or cleansing rituals, culminating with a sweat lodge and feast. I was all-in mentally, spiritually, emotionally. It was a grueling but rewarding experience. At the end of the week, when I exited the sweat lodge, an elder put a hand on my shoulder and asked me to sit (on a rock - this was a fully nude retreat, and I was literally covered with mud and dirt by this point, but that is beside the point and I don't know why I'm telling you this) and handed me a bottle of water. He asked, ""How do you feel?"" I said, ""I think I almost died in there."" He nodded, ""Yeah, I think you did too. You're weak now, that's why I want you sit here and rest. There was something feeding on you, probably been there a long time. That's why you feel weak. But you're lighter now. It's gone now."" He motioned with his hand like a bird flying off. ""This is why we call on the spirits of our grandfathers. To watch over us and protect us from harm."" A few minutes of idle chit-chat, and then, ""Feeling better now?"" I nodded, then he smiled. ""Let's go eat!""

And I *did* feel lighter. Ever since then, that feeling of something dark hanging around me has been gone. That retreat spurred a spiritual awakening in me, and although I haven't participated in anything quite like that since then, I did turn my mental, physical, and spiritual health around with therapy, a gym routine, distance running, healthy diet, and yoga. And of course, since I couldn't help myself, I dabbled in every form of yoga I could find an instructor for, including Kundalini, which opened up yet another terrifying spiritual experience. But that is another story altogether with a similar moral. I apparently didn't learn my lesson the first time but fortunately this one had no long-term repercussions.

Wow, this took a long time to write, and I'm sorry about all of the meandering, but I wanted to report my experience as it happened. My point is, my experience says that it is possible to open a door that you can't close on your own. I had multiple opportunities to receive help in dealing with this, but I passed most of them up by being in denial. Please be careful with your mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. To this day, I still keep white sage on hand for when I feel like I need to cleanse my house (or myself). Although, I only felt that I've really needed it one other time since then.

Just a few disclaimers. I live on land that was ceded by coercive means from the Anishinaabe. I have no indigenous heritage, and although I do my best to be careful about cultural appropriation, I don't always know exactly where that line is. The retreat I went to was fully licensed from, endorsed by, and facilitated by a First Nations tribe. I did my best to describe it faithfully but it was nearly 20 years ago, my memory isn't perfect, and by the time I left that sweat lodge I was in an altered state of mind. So I paraphrased to the best of my recollection. The sage I use at home is either bought from vendors at local pow-wows or grown in my herb garden. The gratitude I feel to the facilitators of that retreat is real.",15,1764126867.0,Paranormal,6,0.9,False

I'm back; sorry to disappear on you. I didn't realize I needed more time until I woke up the next day. The next part of my story is particularly sore for me. Even after all this time... even if I don't deserve to feel sore about it.

I used to be married, you know? Before 001, before the machine, before the job entirely; I was a different man. 4 years; I was happy. And she was...

Nevermind. The higher ups, as mysterious as they were, loved my work with 001. The promotion was changed entirely to a new position: Lead Inquirer. I spent a lot more time with Don and Amanda over various entities, new and old. I had multiple interviews with 001 too. Though most were unresponsive, he did something with me that he did with no one else: grab a chair and sit across from me. The fear I once had was crushed down after each interview. 001 became just another anomaly.

Amanda and I also became more acquainted; Physically. We agreed no strings, just momentary stress relief. Change from drinking and TV every night to some nights of sex was a change I grew accustomed to quite quickly. Whenever she hit me with that look, with those big brown eyes, I knew what to expect that night. Especially if she put her auburn hair into a bun. It was... something I liked.

It was sex; that's all. meaningless sex.

 As the months passed on, the creatures we summoned with the machine became less amalgamous. We saw less quadrupedal ones and even more bipedal. Some even sported five fingers, or had shorter, stouter faces. I remember one, B-351 resembling a lengthy hairless primate with a bulbous throat. Intelligent enough to still follow a regiment to its cell, but a bit aggressive in some areas, so we placed it in B.

Oh, our categorization method; Letters represent danger or perceived danger and the numbers, outside of 1 through 10, are randomly appointed using a computer program. This was because we had an issue with the labeling of 010 and 009 where predetermined numbers would be overwritten and we had to start all over again for the cells and paperwork and- it was just a major chore.

Where was I? Yeah, the increase of bipeds. As I lead the other Interviewers, I didn't need to do much outside of review paperwork and video feeds, so a lot of my underlings did the interviewing. A lot quit after seeing what they saw. One promising hire said the previous one he interviewed looked a lot like a monster he was afraid of when he was a toddler. It was sad to see him go.

Amanda theorized that whatever system governs the multiverse moves similarly to a planetary system and the machine simply grabs a living entity from the closest one. She said it with a lot more syllables than I just did, but she summarized that that's pretty much what she thought was happening.

One day, they fired up the machine and what looked like an astronaut came through. Amanda and I weren't present. I don't think I need to explain what we were doing, but when we found out, she nearly leapt out of her skin with excitement. I watched over the interview live alongside her and many others.

This one seemed to be wearing a metallic suit and a bulbous helmet, with a large, dark, eye-shaped glassy front. No symbols over the suit, but many ridges and dips. Ends of the legs look like boots and the gloves had 2 fingers and a thumb. It was also sitting in a chair across from the interviewer; let's call him Jay. Jay began his questions and assessments.

""Assessment one: among the list written here, I will pronounce various phrases from almost every known language used in forms of greeting, any form of reaction or recognition from you will be noted for the purpose of attempting peaceful contact."" 

The creature, designated A-013, did not respond

""Hello.""

""He-llo"" came a raspy, echo of a voice.

I felt the room get tense and silent. Jay was wide-eyed and looked at the camera then back. ""You can speak?"" Jay stammered out. 

""Y-es.""

""You understand me? You understand English?""

""Y-ou call it 'eng-lish'. We call it 'Gal-bic'."" Its voice was inhuman, very raspy and it halts on every other word briefly. I had, at the time, suddenly wished I did the interview. I remember glancing at Amanda, who shook with excitement and had a huge grin.

""Holy shit..."" whispered another supervisor. 8 years, and we've never had something pulled from that machine be able to speak. ""Do you have a name?"" Jay asked 013.

""Kazab.""

""Well, Kazab, I must admit, we did not expect you to be able to speak. It throws a wrench into our assessments.""

""I am s-orry.""

""No no! This is a great thing. Um... Tell me about your world.""

""W-ith pleasure.""

013 described his world, a great and beautiful expansive plane of flowers, running streams, grand mountains of sparkle and gems, and cities of harmony and peace. A true utopia, by what this croaking creature suggested. Jay then asked about its people and why the suit.

""Discov-ery.""

""Discovery?""

""Yes. My people dete-cted strange spikes in the aura wa-ves. We developed this suit and placed me at the Cent-er point of the readings. The suit is to pro-tect me, and sus-tain me.""

""Impressive...""

Amanda began shaking me, saying, ""Can you believe this, Fritz? Proof of another dimension! Solid, right from their own mouth!"" I had to agree; even my cynicism couldn't break my excitement at that time. Whatever our employers purpose was, it seemed we had been proven correct with what the staff believed. These creatures had been interdimensional all along.

The supervisors were all planning a grand party to celebrate this momentous occasion. Amanda however wanted to celebrate another way. And we had our own 'party' throughout the night. The next day, it was simple work. Paperwork, video review, and some coffee drinking in the gallons. When the evening came, I spoke with Don about the previous day. ""The entire base is in an uproar, Fritz. People are starting to nickname 013.""

""Nickname? Why?""

""I dunno, cause they want to?""

""These things aren't mascots.""

""Try tellin them that.""

I grumbled to myself while sipping a small water bottle. ""What are they calling it?""

""Spaceman."" Don shot finger guns at me when he said this. ""Creative.""

""Lighten up, buddy, people are just excited.""

""Doesn't it have a name already? Kabob, or something?""

""Yeah, but that won't stop 'em.""

""I guess not."" My phone buzzed in my pocket, meanwhile. I answered and heard Amanda.. ""Fritz, come to your room, immediately."" My hair stood on end, excited. ""Yeah, you got it."" I stood right up as I hung the phone up. ""Turning in, Don. Catch you tomorrow.""

""Uh huh, you too, lover boy,"" he teased as I hurried away. I guess at that point everyone either knew or had a feeling what Amanda and I were doing. I doubt we were the only ones, but it did make me feel a little embarrassed. I entered my room, unbuttoning my shirt, only to see a, disappointedly, clothed Amanda.

""Oh, I thought-""

""Hold your horses, big boy, I want to talk to you about something,"" she said in an oddly serious tone. ""Am I in trouble?""

""N-no..."" She sat down on my couch and I immediately sat next to her. ""You want to cut things off.""

""No, GOD, no. I wanted to know if you wanted to take a small vacation."" I shot her a confused look. ""Amanda, I don't think you can fire me without official word from high command,"" I joked. ""Shut up, dumbass. I mean you and me go somewhere for a week. We both have been working real hard and deserve a little sun. You especially, you're pale as paper.""

""Shit, for real? I guess it has been too long since I got out.""

""So...?"" she asked, expectantly. ""Why the hell not? A week with beautiful woman sounds like a great idea."" She smiled, pulling me closer and kissing me. I kissed back and... well, you can guess. I was actually excited to get out of the base for a while. She was right, I had gotten real pale. Almost two months later, we had gotten permission to leave and Amanda booked a flight and a hotel room in the Keys.

We had a lot of fun, in and out of bed. Locked up underground trying to learn of other worlds, you forget how beautiful our sapphire jewel of a planet is. Swimming, diving, touring, it was... the happiest I've been in a long long time. The afternoon before our last day, however...

We were sitting on the balcony of our hotel room. She wore a robe, and I was in my underwear, drinking wine, watching the sun set. ""I needed this..."" she sighed.

""Yeah. I think I did too. Thank you, Amanda. I wouldn't have left if you didn't convince me.""

She laughed in response. ""You just like sleeping with me, you dog!""

""It's a good motivator."" We chuckled and settled into silence. Then she spoke up.

""Fritz...?""

""Yeah?"" I answered without looking. ""Fritz..."" I turned my head to see her staring at me with such serious eyes. And then it clicked. Her eyes shone with fear, determination, and... a look I knew once. A look that I hadn't seen in many years. Those eyes that I've stared in for many nights held such hope and wanting. She yearned for my response. 

I shouldn't have looked away. 

""We agreed, no strings attached."" I said, coldly. The silence after was suffocating. ""Yeah...,"" she sputtered. ""I... I need to get dinner ready."" She got up and hurried off into another room. The night and following day were quiet. We did nothing. No talking, hardly even looking.

I knew I fucked up. Not for her sake, but mine as well. I was so scared... I didn't want to risk hurting again. I was scared to love. I probably still am.

I mentioned my wife earlier. I came home one day after work and found her lying in bed, empty pill bottle by the bed, and cold as a sheet. She suffered a lot but I... I never knew how much until then. I blamed myself. No, I still blame myself. I should've done more for her.

Just as I should've done more for Amanda.

Our flight back was painfully silent. Walking through security was more annoying than it was when we left. Everyone I walked by were abuzz with something, but I didn't care. After I got to my room, I collapsed onto the couch without unpacking, just sitting in darkness. Half an hour later, I heard a knock at the door.

""Fritz? You back?"" It was Don.

""Come in."" I shouted. Don entered and flinched at the darkness, flicking on the light. He looked around until he spotted me and winced. ""Jesus, man. What's wrong?""

""What is it, Don?""

""Oh... right,"" He said, meekly, catching the hint. ""I don't know if you heard but while you were gone, we booted up the machine and got something else.""

""Why is this important?""

""Because it's two stories tall."" I sat up quickly. ""What?""

""It's massive, Fritz. We had to clear out a warehouse to contain it.""

""How did you get it to move?""

""He did it on his own.""

""He?""

""Yeah. He spoke to us."" I fell silent out of surprise. Another one that speaks? ""His designation is A-222. People were quick to give him a name too.""

""What did they call it?""

1p6wtts,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1p6wtts/i_hate_my_family_and_want_to_kill_myself/,I hate my family and want to kill myself,"I have been wanting to make this post for about a month or two now but have been scared to do so.

I’m 15M and my sister is 17F. My parents depicted her as the good sibling and me as the “bad one” all because she’s not autistic and I am. I generally try to avoid my family because every time I try to rationally converse with the whole family at once they always have to side against me for some reason.


A while back I had to go to a coffee shop to do some community hours. Apparently, when I was leaving my sister called me but didn’t notice. On the car ride home it’s somehow my fault that she dint call me again and I didn’t notice. My dad blamed it on my headphones (which I wasn’t wearing but it’s his only argument to side against me) but I think tha my sister should have at least called me again. I ended up going the wrong way even thought I was never given the exactly location and went to a different shop of the same brand.


SO NOW I have to walk 40 more minutes to get to the right place. On the way there my dad calls me to basically yell at me over the phone about how dumb I am for going the wrong way even though I had no directions. When I DO get there my sister and her friend is there. We were there for about 2 1/2 hours and I shit you not, she is ragebaiting me and calling me useless the ENTIRE TIME. Meanwhile, I’m just trying to do my work, and she was just bitching in my ear the whole time. Nevertheless, I did my work, (while masking my annoyance towards her) and we wait outside for my dad. As I get in the car the first thing he says is “why did you go the wrong way” AS IF WE DIDN’T ALREADY TALK ABOUT THAT 3 HOURS AGO. So I’m just going through the motions and shit and he’s clearly mad at me and to make it worse I my sister called me disrespectful (when we were there I didn’t say anything back bc I actually have a sense of respect) even though she not only started it, because she KNOWS he’ll side with her at this point. (I’ve called it out several times but they just ignore me)


She also gets away with things I can’t, such as telling to kms or die over the smallest shit (the other day I showed her a Pokémon pack, then THROWS IT ACROSS THE ROOM just because I wanted to open since I bought it with my own money and then told me to kms) Idk what it is but something about her saying something like that to me genuinely hurts me in a way nothing else can make me feel. Now sometimes she gets really angry and beats me relentlessly if she’s slightly angry. Scratching punching, kicking, she’s even tried to BITE ME before. It’s gotten to the point where I flinch when people move slightly or raise their arms, just because what she did to me. I would tell my mom in the morning that I got fucking assaulted by my sister last night (as you could see by the multiple bruises on my arms) and she would do/say LITERALLY NOTHING. Now I’ve never “fought back” because if I did the shit she did to me my parents would crucify me lmao. One time, a few years ago, she got really mad, and pulled out A LITERAL *stabby thing* swiped it at me, she missed, then just pointed at me for like 15 seconds (I was like 8 at the time and could barely speak)

How I’m at the point where I don’t want to do this because I can’t contribute, my entire family hates me, I hate my autism with everything I have and I’ve wanted to kill myself for it. (I haven’t actually tried but I did have to stop myself from jumping off a bridge last month)",2,1764126524.0,autism,5,1.0,False

1p6wp6e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p6wp6e/aitah_or_not_trying_to_fix_my_relationship_with/,AITAH or not trying to fix my relationship with my sister?,"Let's start from the beginning, my sister was diagnosed with high functioning autism. I will call her K, She is 7 years older than me, and when I was a kid I very much looked up to her. I would've considered her my best friend. As I got older though I started noticing differences, she was quite controlling and we walked on egg shells around her. As I became a teenager, I remember that BOTH of us were nasty to each other. She became the first person that I hated, and I made comments all the time. K also, touched my butt and picked my belly button when i asked her not to, her reason was that my husband would do it to me. It made me vedy upset and uncomfortable and there were lots of unwanted touches. As time went on, things came to a head and when my mom and dad left us alone together in the house.

I remember sitting in the living room and eating the dinner i made for myself. She started berrating me from the dining room, I proceeded to ignore her as I wasn't interested in fighting. She was very interested in fighting, so she came up flipped my food onto me and started yelling in my face. Of course she is a lot larger than me even now, but then the difference was extremely obvious (she was 22 and I was 15). 

My first thought was getting to a phone to call my parents (probably should've dialed 911). She towered over me screaming in my face, telling me i must be bullied at school otherwise why would i act the way i do. Then when I saw an opening I ran for the landline dialing a few numbers before she grabbed it from my hand and slammed it down. Next it was trying to find a place to lock myself in, I made it to the dining room and then was able to get up the stairs to my parents room. I was not fast enough to lock the door, or use their phone. For another few minutes I was stuck with her towering over me, and scared if I responded it would escalate. My next thought was the mainfloor bathroom, and I made my next run. I was not fast enough to lock the door, and she cornered me. My next plan to use my iPod to contact someone for help failed as she tried to break it and blame me for if it broke. 

It ended with her screaming at me, asking me why I treated her that way. Me scared out of my mind, couldn't answer and just said I don't know.  After that it was a blur, at some point I told my parents what happened when they came home. My father asked me if I wanted to press charges. All I could think was that I don't want to break up the family, it would be my fault so I said no. 

After this incident, I was terrified of her, and was stuck living with her for a month. Locking myself in my parents room whenever my parents would leave me alone with her. She made fun of me for it. 

As was the trend before this all happened she was still getting into fights with my dad and sometimes my mom. Her and my dad were explosive, and it never went well. Now though she blamed me for all the fights between her and everyone. She tried to trap me and my other sister, but we were able to get out of a window and contact someone to help us. After a month her and my dad had a huge blow out she broke a bunch of stuff and was finally kicked out.

This now meant that I was to blame for all the fights, issues, and her getting kicked out. My mom continuously asked me to have empathy for her. I became a recluse never leaving my room, and was thrown into a nice sprinkle of depression which my parents aptly ignored. Before she came to get her stuff back, my mom told me she was going out for a bit and that K would be there. I begged her not to leave, telling her it will happen again. She still left telling me she won't do it again. For some reason I believed her, but of course it did. At least this time, i was able to run outside (summertime). I was able to get help and someone came to get me. On the way to their house i saw my mom driving back and hoped in with her crying. 

As I grew, my mom pushed me for a relationship with her. I tried many times to have conversations with her to try and repair things. Every time we did, I would try to make it clear that both of us were in the wrong. All she heard was how terrible I was to her, and although the conversations would temporarily resolve things, somehow I would become the devil again. 

I got through high school, took a year off then went off to do mission work for a year. I came home for Christmas and instintively pulled away when K tried to touch me, but didn't even register it. Later she gave me the silent treatment, and was crazy pissed off. I tried to talk to her and ask her what was wrong and she said, ""if you don't know I'm not going to tell you."" At that moment, I decided never to do that to anyone. I was depressed, my dad got sick, and by the time I moved back home my sister K was back in the house just before me. This time with the worst cat in the world and a basement suite. I felt bombarded with change and forced to live with someone that couldn't even see me as a person. The first day I came back I found a dead mouse in my room and cried. I was hopeful that maybe things would be different, but I felt the resentment radiate from the basement. She was more controlling than ever, and blamed me even more for all the problems in her relationships. 

My only thought was to get out of there, so I decided I was going to move to another city where my sister D and J lived. When i moved, it was like breathing again, i was still depressed, but the threat on me was gone. I started dating someone, and my sister K had gotten engaged. My mom asked me to go to a psychologist with her, of course I said yes. It seemed that my mom wanted me invited to the wedding. The next time I came home to introduce my partner to my family, I also went to see HER psychologist. The psychologist, had us talk to him separately and all he told me was to give her whatever she wanted. Me, ever the peacekeeper and unsure how to do that anymore did what he asked. Accept, she asked me to tell my parents that I manipulated both of them, at 15 scared shitless. Bonus, she had to believe me. So I cried and told them what she asked me to, and IT WAS A LIE. My partner told me that I should have never done that, and I agree now. At the time though, I thought it meant this battle was over.

The next time she saw me, I went for a hug and she signaled that she didn't want one. Of course, that was fine, but apparently I was supposed to be mad that she didn't want a hug? Every time I heard her reason for as my family would say add me to THE LIST, it was through another family member not her. I would just get the silent treatment and then at the most inconvenient times a conversation about how I'm the worst and should apologize for everything wrong in her life. It sounds like an exaggeration, but barely.

We move ahead, she gets married and we go up for the weekend, no drama, she was very distracted. A little while later I come home for my bridal shower, which my mom knowing all the things that have happened with us decides to throw at K's house? Before the bridal shower, I'm helping set up, my fiance is hanging out with my dad and brothers. K asked to go for coffee, and me ever the optimist thinks maybe things are okay. 

NOPE.

She decided to be nice all the way until I was stuck with her at the coffee shop. Then she starts talking about how terrible a person I am, how I've ruined every relationship in our family with her. This time though, I say no to saying sorry. I decide thats enough and walk away, thinking about how I'm going to get home if she decides to leave me there. She didn't, but of course tells me how I don't care about her the whole way to her house. 

My partner and I get married, she came. I got pregnant saw them again, but things seemed okay. My now husband, made me feel safe and her soft spot for him helped in so many ways. We didn't go back home for a long time, had 2 kids. 

Came to visit and stayed with K which ended up being okay, my husband was with me the whole time. I really thought maybe things were okay.

3 years, we didn't talk, didn't see each other accept when she visited which was fine. Then we finally decided to make the trip back to my hometown for my grandma's birthday. My parents who had moved close to me and my sisters, would be staying with my parents would be staying with my sister K. There was no way we could fit, so we asked my aunty and she suggested staying at one of her friends houses that I knew. More than enough room, and an office so my husband could work. 

I texted K when I was coming down and that we would love to see her and her family. She asked if she could watch my kids for a sleepover, and I told her we were planning to try to stay together as a family as much as possible.  Which was mostly true because we had had such a busy time with emergency bathroom renos and my husband's huge project at work this was family time. The added thing was that sleepovers were a privilege and were only for a select few people. I offered to do a beach day or something else altogether, but she didn't respond.

When we went down to my home town, my dad came over and told me I was on THE LIST for not staying at her house. No communication on her front that was a deal breaker. A few days later she called and asked me out for coffee just me. Hell to the no, but I reiterated that we wanted as much family time as possible and then she hung up. I had decided that I no longer wanted to be alone with her. Then she sent me one last text, ""Please do not contact me again unless it is through a phycologist. I have nothing to say to you.""

My husband and I decided that there is no point in repairing something that was not healthy for anyone. I understand that autistic people can have a hard time with empathy, but from every conversation I've had with her over my life, it seems that she doesn't have any. She has no concept of who I am as a person and sees me as the devil manipulating everyone against her. Everyone in my family, especially my mom and my sister D have brought up everything she is struggling with and how she feels whenever I have brought up my feelings about her asking me to have empathy. I've tried, and my husband has seen me, and my mom has somewhat given up fixing it right now. Honestly, I'm at the point of just not caring about it, if she decides to give me the silent treatment at family stuff i don't care. I am tired of being accused of things I didn't do, and tired of trying to fix things. Although, I'm still unsure of what boundaries I should place or if I should leave it like I'm planning and just speak truth when needed.",1,1764126148.0,AITAH,1,0.67,False

1p6wnij,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1p6wnij/having_a_support_system_is_a_privilege_and_it/,Having a support system is a privilege and it sucks not having one.,"There is no place in this world for me, except for the one I built for myself and the silence is painfully deafening.  
I ended up isolating myself for almost 2 years because there's currently a wave of xenophobia in the country where I've lived for 12 years, and even though I'm half local because my biological father is from here, physically I look foreign and... you know how most of the world is when you're not white.

On top of being an inmigrant, I don't have a support system. My mother is a narcissist who has squeezed the life out of everyone who has ever come near her, and we had to send her back to our country of origin because she literally went psychotic and was psychologically torturing my younger brother, who has autism.  
I have seen my biological father five times in my entire life, and he lives in another country with his perfect legitimate daughters (as he keeps telling me).  
My younger brother has complex communication issues and is unable to talk to me as a human being, but rather as the solver of his problems, or a venting trashcan, because that has been my role all my life.

As an immigrant from a country with a large wave of migration, the two friends I made during my youth are now in different continents.  
I have been living for 12 years in a country where, although I had no trouble integrating because for some reason I'm a very functional worker, I have not been able to make friends at all. It's lonely. Painfully lonely.

Yes, I've been in therapy for 8 years.  
It's not all bad, just to clarify: I have a remote job. It was good until recently, but that's another topic. I'm happily married. I have a roof over my head, and finally i can buy all thebooks and mangas i deprived myself for years because of being ultrapoor and moving over 50 times trying to make my life better.  
And I know that at this part of my life I am not as bad as I were 10 years ago. I'm not complaining about what I have, but i have worked my ass off to have the life i have now, it's no privilege. 

It's just that I'm almost 40 and I feel like there's no place for me in the world, and the feeling that you can't fail, can't stop, and have to keep going on and on because no one's got your back for even 5 minutes, is painful as heck.  
I am aware that I have a loving husband, but it's not healthy to only have your partner to talk to, or to depend on, especially when you're trying to recover from CPTSD. And no, I don't want to meet people to vent about my problems, no. I don't want to cry on anyone's shoulder. If i need to vent, i wait every 2 weeks to speak with my therapist. I'm getting good at swallowing my pain.

I want people to share good moments with. And if they have bad moments i'd like to be there too. I like to be there and I would like to think someone could be there for me too. 

I go to the movies on my own, I travel alone, I go for walks alone, go for a coffee alone. I enjoy it. I don't hate being with myself.   
But my days are too silent. I want to watch a series, an anime or a movie and discuss it with someone. 

It's been hard.   
Not having anyone to tell them, “Hey, do you want to come over and watch anime or a movie? I'll cook your favorite dish!”  
Not having anyone to send you a birthday message.  
Not having anyone to invite over for Christmas dinner.   
That's all I want. To share special moments, the beautiful things in life. I would also love to be taken care of, just for an hour at least.  
I'm an ambivert, I need sporadic contact with other people even if it depletes my social battery and i need 7 business days to recover! 

For a year and a half, I've been going out once every two months to some social activity, but I can't seem to keep the contact beyond exchanging Instagrams. It's impossible to get a response to a message in stories beyond a “like.”  
I'd love to have a supportive mother.  
I'd like to feel what is to have a father.   
I'd like to hear the advise of a wise grandparent.  
I'd love to receive the unconditional love of a younger brother.  
I'd love to have a message that says ""hey, wanna go for a beer?""

I wrote a fiction book for the first time, and I'm thinking about publishing it. The editor asked ""who you'd invite to the book launch?"" I'm tremendously happy about my book  
My husband isn't even interesting in reading it. Not  his topic. Will not pressure him either.

It's lonely here.

I don't think i'm an amazing person  but i am definitely not an awful one either. I've been always there when someone needs me.  
That's it. I just wanted to vent because my throat is tight and my  chest feels heavy.

As The Corrs & Bono once sang:  
♫Where do you go when you're lonely? Where do you go when you're blue♫

1p6wnhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/centrist/comments/1p6wnhu/anyone_else_have_bad_experiences_on_online/,Anyone else have bad experiences on online political spaces?,"I’ll start:

I’m a former libertarian. I was raised by libertarian parents who are pro LGBT, pro gender equality, pro legal marijuana, and are pro business/free markets. In the morning to this day I see my dad reading economics articles in his reason magazine socks while drinking black coffee. They always wanted me to get an education and be self sufficient. 

However, when I was in a libertarian discord years ago, I can’t even describe how much authoritarian right wing rhetoric I saw.

There was also tons of misogynistic rhetoric as well. The majority of the server felt as if women should not work and should stay at home and care for children instead of “their useless HR jobs” because of how their “brain is wired socially instead of logically”

Many people also said “women and immigrants steal jobs from American men” which strikes me as even more bizarre considering I thought libertarianism was about giving more freedom to businesses so they can grow.

There were a few actual libertarians there and anarchists who just wanted to grill, but the loudest voices in the server became white supremacists in there who just wanted to smoke weed.

I remember using a particular antisemitic slur (That I had no clue was a slur) I learned there that (one regarding Jewish people and food) because I thought it meant Jewish people eat healthy, and my brother who is a left wing political scientist turned around and looked at me with his mouth agape wide open when I said it. 

It was just an unfortunate learning experience, and I got along with everyone pretty well there, but I eventually just left one day because it was so polarizing and divisive and culture war based. 

I also realized it seems like most of our issues come from corporate greed and not government taxes, as we currently have a fiscal conservative in office and the rich have gotten richer yet I still do not see prices going down.

1p6wnco,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1p6wnco/still_dont_know_how_to_process_thishelp/,Still don't know how to process this...help,"Let's start from the beginning, my sister was diagnosed with high functioning autism. I will call her K, She is 7 years older than me, and when I was a kid I very much looked up to her. I would've considered her my best friend. As I got older though I started noticing differences, she was quite controlling and we walked on egg shells around her. As I became a teenager, I remember that BOTH of us were nasty to each other. She became the first person that I hated, and I made comments all the time. K also, touched my butt and picked my belly button when i asked her not to, her reason was that my husband would do it to me. It made me vedy upset and uncomfortable and there were lots of unwanted touches. As time went on, things came to a head and when my mom and dad left us alone together in the house.

I remember sitting in the living room and eating the dinner i made for myself. She started berrating me from the dining room, I proceeded to ignore her as I wasn't interested in fighting. She was very interested in fighting, so she came up flipped my food onto me and started yelling in my face. Of course she is a lot larger than me even now, but then the difference was extremely obvious (she was 22 and I was 15). 

My first thought was getting to a phone to call my parents (probably should've dialed 911). She towered over me screaming in my face, telling me i must be bullied at school otherwise why would i act the way i do. Then when I saw an opening I ran for the landline dialing a few numbers before she grabbed it from my hand and slammed it down. Next it was trying to find a place to lock myself in, I made it to the dining room and then was able to get up the stairs to my parents room. I was not fast enough to lock the door, or use their phone. For another few minutes I was stuck with her towering over me, and scared if I responded it would escalate. My next thought was the mainfloor bathroom, and I made my next run. I was not fast enough to lock the door, and she cornered me. My next plan to use my iPod to contact someone for help failed as she tried to break it and blame me for if it broke. 

It ended with her screaming at me, asking me why I treated her that way. Me scared out of my mind, couldn't answer and just said I don't know.  After that it was a blur, at some point I told my parents what happened when they came home. My father asked me if I wanted to press charges. All I could think was that I don't want to break up the family, it would be my fault so I said no. 

After this incident, I was terrified of her, and was stuck living with her for a month. Locking myself in my parents room whenever my parents would leave me alone with her. She made fun of me for it. 

As was the trend before this all happened she was still getting into fights with my dad and sometimes my mom. Her and my dad were explosive, and it never went well. Now though she blamed me for all the fights between her and everyone. She tried to trap me and my other sister, but we were able to get out of a window and contact someone to help us. After a month her and my dad had a huge blow out she broke a bunch of stuff and was finally kicked out.

This now meant that I was to blame for all the fights, issues, and her getting kicked out. My mom continuously asked me to have empathy for her. I became a recluse never leaving my room, and was thrown into a nice sprinkle of depression which my parents aptly ignored. Before she came to get her stuff back, my mom told me she was going out for a bit and that K would be there. I begged her not to leave, telling her it will happen again. She still left telling me she won't do it again. For some reason I believed her, but of course it did. At least this time, i was able to run outside (summertime). I was able to get help and someone came to get me. On the way to their house i saw my mom driving back and hoped in with her crying. 

As I grew, my mom pushed me for a relationship with her. I tried many times to have conversations with her to try and repair things. Every time we did, I would try to make it clear that both of us were in the wrong. All she heard was how terrible I was to her, and although the conversations would temporarily resolve things, somehow I would become the devil again. 

I got through high school, took a year off then went off to do mission work for a year. I came home for Christmas and instintively pulled away when K tried to touch me, but didn't even register it. Later she gave me the silent treatment, and was crazy pissed off. I tried to talk to her and ask her what was wrong and she said, ""if you don't know I'm not going to tell you."" At that moment, I decided never to do that to anyone. I was depressed, my dad got sick, and by the time I moved back home my sister K was back in the house just before me. This time with the worst cat in the world and a basement suite. I felt bombarded with change and forced to live with someone that couldn't even see me as a person. The first day I came back I found a dead mouse in my room and cried. I was hopeful that maybe things would be different, but I felt the resentment radiate from the basement. She was more controlling than ever, and blamed me even more for all the problems in her relationships. 

My only thought was to get out of there, so I decided I was going to move to another city where my sister D and J lived. When i moved, it was like breathing again, i was still depressed, but the threat on me was gone. I started dating someone, and my sister K had gotten engaged. My mom asked me to go to a psychologist with her, of course I said yes. It seemed that my mom wanted me invited to the wedding. The next time I came home to introduce my partner to my family, I also went to see HER psychologist. The psychologist, had us talk to him separately and all he told me was to give her whatever she wanted. Me, ever the peacekeeper and unsure how to do that anymore did what he asked. Accept, she asked me to tell my parents that I manipulated both of them, at 15 scared shitless. Bonus, she had to believe me. So I cried and told them what she asked me to, and IT WAS A LIE. My partner told me that I should have never done that, and I agree now. At the time though, I thought it meant this battle was over.

The next time she saw me, I went for a hug and she signaled that she didn't want one. Of course, that was fine, but apparently I was supposed to be mad that she didn't want a hug? Every time I heard her reason for as my family would say add me to THE LIST, it was through another family member not her. I would just get the silent treatment and then at the most inconvenient times a conversation about how I'm the worst and should apologize for everything wrong in her life. It sounds like an exaggeration, but barely.

We move ahead, she gets married and we go up for the weekend, no drama, she was very distracted. A little while later I come home for my bridal shower, which my mom knowing all the things that have happened with us decides to throw at K's house? Before the bridal shower, I'm helping set up, my fiance is hanging out with my dad and brothers. K asked to go for coffee, and me ever the optimist thinks maybe things are okay. 

NOPE.

She decided to be nice all the way until I was stuck with her at the coffee shop. Then she starts talking about how terrible a person I am, how I've ruined every relationship in our family with her. This time though, I say no to saying sorry. I decide thats enough and walk away, thinking about how I'm going to get home if she decides to leave me there. She didn't, but of course tells me how I don't care about her the whole way to her house. 

My partner and I get married, she came. I got pregnant saw them again, but things seemed okay. My now husband, made me feel safe and her soft spot for him helped in so many ways. We didn't go back home for a long time, had 2 kids. 

Came to visit and stayed with K which ended up being okay, my husband was with me the whole time. I really thought maybe things were okay.

3 years, we didn't talk, didn't see each other accept when she visited which was fine. Then we finally decided to make the trip back to my hometown for my grandma's birthday. My parents who had moved close to me and my sisters, would be staying with my parents would be staying with my sister K. There was no way we could fit, so we asked my aunty and she suggested staying at one of her friends houses that I knew. More than enough room, and an office so my husband could work. 

I texted K when I was coming down and that we would love to see her and her family. She asked if she could watch my kids for a sleepover, and I told her we were planning to try to stay together as a family as much as possible.  Which was mostly true because we had had such a busy time with emergency bathroom renos and my husband's huge project at work this was family time. The added thing was that sleepovers were a privilege and were only for a select few people. I offered to do a beach day or something else altogether, but she didn't respond.

When we went down to my home town, my dad came over and told me I was on THE LIST for not staying at her house. No communication on her front that was a deal breaker. A few days later she called and asked me out for coffee just me. Hell to the no, but I reiterated that we wanted as much family time as possible and then she hung up. I had decided that I no longer wanted to be alone with her. Then she sent me one last text, ""Please do not contact me again unless it is through a phycologist. I have nothing to say to you.""

My husband and I decided that there is no point in repairing something that was not healthy for anyone. I understand that autistic people can have a hard time with empathy, but from every conversation I've had with her over my life, it seems that she doesn't have any. She has no concept of who I am as a person and sees me as the devil manipulating everyone against her. Everyone in my family, especially my mom and my sister D have brought up everything she is struggling with and how she feels whenever I have brought up my feelings about her asking me to have empathy. I've tried, and my husband has seen me, and my mom has somewhat given up fixing it right now. Honestly, I'm at the point of just not caring about it, if she decides to give me the silent treatment at family stuff i don't care. I am tired of being accused of things I didn't do, and tired of trying to fix things. Although, I'm still unsure of what boundaries I should place or if I should leave it like I'm planning and just speak truth when needed.",1,1764126004.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

Pulled the cover and the timing chain looked like it aged ten years overnight.

Hooked up my ad600s to see what the numbers were doing.Cold start trims were hovering around +12 to +15 percent and smoothed out after a minute, which matched the brief rough idle. But once the engine warmed up, the timing advance on bank 1 started jumping between 2° and 9° at idle, and the cam/crank correlation kept drifting by a few degrees every time the RPM dipped.

That was enough to tear it down. Sure enough: the guides were chewed up, the tensioner was almost bottomed out, and the chain had so much slack you could probably tune it to a low E.

With a set of SATA tools, a Bosch tensioner, a fresh chain kit, and more coffee than I’d like to admit, it turned into a full timing job.

It seems as though I’m losing my body. My face. My spirt, and my soul. And yet, not a single person knows.

Or at least they pretend not to.

You see, a few months ago, I was kidnapped.

Masked men came into my family home while I slept. They awoke me and I tried to scream, but it was too late. They had already clasped a strong hand over my mouth and were prepping a rag soaked in what I assumed was chloroform.

The tallest of the men held me down while his companions pressed the rag firmly against my face.

My vision started to swim and, no matter how hard I tried, I could not remain conscious.

I woke up periodically. I remember being in the back of what appeared to be a moving-truck, like a u-haul or something.

I remember the cold metal floor of the vehicle as I struggled and failed to find my bearings; the way the turns slid me around and knocked me against the walls.

The next thing I remembered was being dragged from the truck by the same masked men who took me. They pulled me across the floor like a butchered cow carcass, waiting to be cut into slabs of steak.

They actually just let me fall, straight to the ground, upon nearing the giant exit.

The fall caused me to smack my head against the concrete, knocking me fully unconscious yet again.

When I awoke a third time, I was tied to a chair. The room was dark, aside from the light of a projector that cascaded bright fluorescent light against the concrete wall.

I was stripped down to my underwear, which appeared to be stained with urine and sweat.

The room was absolutely freezing, and I felt my body shiver as goosebumps arose one by one across my body.

My head pounded from my fall and from the effects of the drugs I had been on. It took me a few moments to regain my full vision, and when I did, I noticed something that turned the blood in my veins to ice.

It was an operating table. Beside it, a cart lined with all manner of surgical tools.

This awoke something within me.

I began to struggle violently against my restraints, shaking and thrashing like a man possessed.

In the process I ended up falling over again, still tied to the chair. I heard a sickening SNAP as my bound wrist smashed against the concrete floor.

As I cried out in pain, the projector screen suddenly shifted, and began playing a video.

It was a video of my family home, in flames. The fire roared and reached out to touch the  heavens.

Firefighters worked diligently to ease the blaze, but it seemed as though the harder they fought, the more the fire blazed.

Black smoke billowed from my childhood home, and my eyes began to welt up with tears I’d never thought possible.

Then, just as quickly as it came, the video abruptly stopped, and the room went completely black.

And I sat there, alone and nearly completely naked in utter frozen darkness.

I was forced to be listen to my own thoughts for what felt like an eternity. I broke my own heart several times over, and by the end of everything, I had been defeated entirely.

I lay there, face soaked with tears, shivering on the cold floor, when the projection screen suddenly turned back on.

This time, it was showing footage of the local news.

“DEVASTATING HOUSE-FIRE LEAVES GAINESVILLE HOME DESTROYED- NO BODIES RECOVERED.”

I stared at the screen, and a small wave of relief washed over me. That feeling quickly dissipated, however, when  I realized: my parents had definitely been home at the time of my kidnapping.

My relief turned to confusion, then to dread.

As if responding to my thoughts, a single fluorescent light flicked on, stretching down and revealing a tarp under its illumination.

I felt bile rise in my stomach as the anxiety of what could lie beneath the tarp taunted me; forced a million different scenarios through my head.

My heart pounded in my ears, deafeningly, and the sheer magnitude of my sensory overload was making me dizzy, and nauseous.

I felt the puke pull its way from my stomach and up my throat, spilling out onto my bare chest and puddling onto the floor.

In response to this, every light flicked on in an instant. It was so blinding that it made it nearly impossible for me to see the armed guards that came filing into the room.

Their rifles were trained on me, and each officer had their shield raised, as though I was the one to be scared of.

The team of guards then parted, never taking their eyes off of me, to make room for the men in white coats and surgical masks.

Whilst two guards restrained me, the three men in white coats prepped their surgical tools.

The guards cut the ropes from my hands, and my arms fell limply to my side, aching and shot with pins and needles.

As if I were threatening in any sort of way, one of the guards yanked my wrists behind my back, shooting a white hot pain up through my entire right arm.

I screamed in agony and was answered with a punch to the face.

The guards slammed me down on the operating table before tightening the restraints around my wrists, one of which I was CONFIDENT was shattered.

Once they had tightened the straps around each of my limbs, one by one they began filing out of the room, just as they had came.

The room was now deafeningly silent.

I cringed at the sight of the doctors who seemed to be wrapping up their preparations.

One of them looked over his shoulders to glance at me.

His face was displayed a look of indifference.

A lack of any sort of conscience.

He had a job to do, and I was his business.

Finally, he turned to me.

As he approached, his two colleagues walked solemnly towards the tarp a few meters away.

They were the ones that had my attention.

I watched them all the way up until one of them grabbed the tarp by its edges and yanked on it, revealing what I feared the most.

My parents lay there, blue and stiff.

They were both completely nude, and each had a sliced wound that stretched across their neck from one ear to the next.

They were nearly decapitated.

I began to thrash against the restraints, screaming at the top of my lungs for somebody, please, anybody, please just help me.

The doctors just allowed me to scream.

They allowed me to cry and waste my energy.

I went on for 5 straight minutes before the head doctor fastened a gag in my mouth and muffled what little screaming I had left in me.

As my eyes darted around the room, exhaustedly, they found their way back to my parents and the two doctors.

As they analyzed the bodies with a disgusting lack of care, one of them then proceeded to pick my mother’s head off the ground before twisting it around in his hands, checking for abnormalities.

They hadn’t NEARLY been decapitated. They were.

Standing from his kneeling position, the other doctor then walked over and picked my father’s head from the ground, mimicking the process of his colleague.

I couldn’t help it anymore and began puking through the gag, praying that I’d drown in my own vomit.

That wish was vanquished, however, when for the first time, the head doctor showed urgency.

He quickly removed the gag before forcing my head up.

My vomit spilled all over my body and in that moment, I begged God for death.

The head doctor gave me a glance that was almost…disappointed… disgusted at what I had done to myself.

Without taking his eyes off me, he reached down and retrieved a bucket of ice cold water, which he then proceeded to splash directly on top of me.

The shock made me tense up against the restraints, and I felt my wrist throb in pain.

My agony blurred my vision and made it seem as though the other two doctors had appeared beside the head doctor out of nowhere.

Each of them held a severed head belonging to one of each of my parents.

I couldn’t help but stare at them.

Their jaws hung open, and their tongues seemed bloated and inhuman.

The gore that dripped from their necks nailed utter grief straight through my soul.

And you know what the doctors did?

They tossed them onto one of the surgical carts like they were nothing. Like they were dirty tools, in need of sterilization.

I had no energy left to fight. No energy left to struggle. And the doctors sensed that.

There seemed to be an ever so subtle decrease in the tension amongst them, and it tore me apart.

As if to throw a bag of salt in my massive gaping wounds, they began chit chatting amongst each other.

Laughing and gawking in a language that was foreign to me.

One of them then proceeded to play opera music from his phone. Neither of his colleagues objected and instead, it seemed as though it increased their focus.

Without anesthesia, they began poking at me. Sticking me with needles and carving at the flesh on my face.

I felt blood trickle down my face, turning into a full faucet of the crimson liquid that poured out and leaked onto the operating table.

I let out one final scream, prompting one of the surgeons to jump and cut deep into my forehead.

It was evident that this frustrated him. Anger sounds the same in many languages.

He ordered his colleague to take a pair of clamps and pinch them firmly against my tongue.

The jagged teeth bit down hard and immediately filled my mouth with the taste of copper and iron.

The head doctor saw this, and I swear to God, the fucker smirked at me, satisfied at how helpless I looked.

He then regained his concentration, and began carving again.

He slides along the outline of my face, dragging his scalpel with nearly laser-like precision.

Once he connected the outline, he took his gloved hands, and started to pull ever so slightly on the flaps of skin he had opened up.

The pain became too much, and I’m not ashamed to say that I blacked out.

My mind had shattered, and I no longer had the strength to remain conscious.

When I awoke, I could feel the slight pressure of bandages that wrapped around the entirety of my head.

They covered my nose and mouth, but left two small slits that allowed me vision.

And through those slits, I was able to see something.

Something that no man should ever see.

Hanging on display, right in front of the operating table, was my own face. Hollow and lifeless. It looked identical to a mask you’d find in a Halloween store.

To make matters worse, I found that I couldn’t move. No matter how hard I tried, it felt as though I was completely paralyzed.

I also found that I wasn’t alone in the room.

“So you’re awake.”

The deep Slavic accent jolted me and my eyes immediately darted to the right.

“Hello, my sweet little experiment.”

The head doctor was sitting alone in a chair watching me, casually drinking from a coffee mug.

“You see, little experiment, I am friends with very rich people. Filthy rich. Rich enough to make you, your entire family, poof- disappear.”

His words bounced around in my head like a parasite, trying to claw its way straight through to my cerebellum.

His mask was pulled down now, revealing a gruff looking face. He has a shadowy beard, and his eyes were like that of a great white shark.

“My friends, they want to play little game. They make you disappear, whole family disappear. But YOU, little experiment, YOU go back.”

For the fist time in what felt like ages, I found the courage to speak.

“Go back? Go back after everything that’s happened? You guys are just gonna…let me go?”

I began to laugh uncontrollably, almost impulsively.

“Oh no, buddy. Hahahahaha you’re gonna have to kill me here. I don’t care HOW rich your friends are, you WILL pay for this.”

The doctor began to chuckle, then he himself began to laugh uncontrollably.

“Oh no, little experiment, we don’t kill you. We kill your parents. You, we need ALIVE.”

We then stared at each other, all whilst he enjoyed his cup of coffee.

“Well, if it’s okay with you,” he joked, “we must continue on with experiment.”

He stood up briskly and clapped his hands together.

As he walked over, casually, back to his surgical tool cart, I found that my mother and father had also been stripped of their faces.

“No one believe you. They think you are, how do you say? Koo-koo?”

After slipping on his gloves, I watched in horror as he picked up my father’s face. He waved it in front of me, tormenting me with the gore.

He then played around with my mother’s face. Twirling it around like a toy. He made her and my father kiss, all while laughing and singing like a mad man.

Using a pair of sheers, he cut little patches out of each of their faces, placing each piece on his tool cart.

He cut their faces down until they were nothing more than a pile of puzzle pieces, scattered across the cart.

“This is my favorite part,” he announced, cheerily.

For the next 6 hours, he stitched together a brand new face out of the chunks of what were once the smiling faces of my parents.

The creation was grotesque, and absolutely menacing.

“Don’t worry my little experiment. You three will soon be together forever.”

He carefully began to unravel my bandages, the early wrappings getting stuck to the open wound in the process and pulling at exposed nerves.

“I will make you….BEAUTIFUL, again, eh?”

Placing his new face on top of where mine should’ve been, he shifted it around until it fit perfectly amongst the seams on my face that he had created.

Again, without anesthesia, he began stitching my parents to me.

I felt the needle be inserted each and every time, and all I could do was sob silently.

Once he finished the initial stitching, he took an even smaller needle, and sewed the eyelids to the flaps of skin that remained atop my eyes.

“Has to be believable, yes?”

Blacking out from the pain once again, I drifted into a dreamless sleep.

When I awoke, I was still strapped to that damn table.

My face throbbed in agony, and the fluorescent lights seemed to burrow down deep into my eyes.

I found that the guards had returned, and the doctors were nowhere to be seen.

Without warning, 3 guards scooped me up from the table and cuffed me to a wheelchair, which they then proceeded to push towards the exit.

They brought me back to the same truck, but my torment was not over.

They drugged me yet again.

This time, however, it was lab grade methemphetamine.

They shot it straight into my veins, and locked me back inside the dark box truck.

I was completely losing it, and quite literally felt as though I was in Hell during the entire journey.

Every turn caused me to tumble, and the paranoia made me feel like my heart was going to explode.

The men decided to dump me on the side of the road, like trash, after removing their handcuffs.

They gave me one final punch to the gut before getting in their truck and driving away, never to be seen again.

I wandered through town, looking more monstrous than I believed imaginable for a civilian.

I got numerous pitiful glances, and many people seemed to divert their eyes any time I came within their vision.

As I wandered around, looking disfigured and homeless, I noticed something.

A missing persons poster.

One with my name and face on it.

There were dozens of them pasted across town, on nearly every small business and grocery store.

Yet, no one saw me.

No one noticed me right in front of them.

I told them, I said, “That is me, I am the person on that poster,” and hardly received any acknowledgement whatsoever.

A police officer stopped me, and the hope that maybe FINALLY I could get some recognition or genuine help was dashed immediately when he fined me for loitering and public indecency. He looked at me with such judgement and my heart froze over.

I tried showing him, I tried pulling my false face off but all he did was restrain me. All these fucking restraints.

He cuffed me and took me to the station, and STILL no one knew who I was.

They labeled me as insane, a crazed junky off the streets.

They went as far as to hold me in jail until my court date.

The judge herself found me insane, and sentenced me to spend time in the local insane asylum.

I keep trying, I keep attempting to pull this face off but it just will not budge. The stitching must have been flawless because, now,  I can’t even get past a slight peeling of the skin without giving up.

I just need you all to believe me, I need you all to hear me, I need you all to SEE me.

I’m the boy from the missing person posters, please help me.",2,1764125778.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

I have a good grinder now having fixed the dialing in on my Gevi Grindmaster so I can go for something nice which won't require a built in grinder. 

  
I recently returned the Meraki mainly due to the grinder being insufficient (Hence purchasing the Gevi GM) and also showing signs of some smaller issues which gave me a little bit of longevity anxiety. I wasn't sure it was wise to keep a machine from a relatively unknown manufacturer out of China even though it had some amazing aspects and the coffee with medium roast was some of the most delicious I've tried.  The rotary pump was great. The steam wand also good but not the biggest boiler for steam and ultimately the fear of how long this bit of tech would last was enough for me to return it.



I am now looking for a new machine ideally I would like dual boiler, potentially rotary pump. 



I've never used a ​E61 Heat exchanger having gone from Breville Barrista impress to Meraki and so any tips on whether to avoid or go for them would be great.

  
I like the idea of the Profitec 800 lever machine but the 45 min heat up timer is a definite no go lol.

Anyway I really would love some advice from owners of other machines. I want it to last a decade minimum really and will conduct regular maintenance and use spring water exclusively. 

  
Pls let me know what you guys think. 

  
Thanks.

There were some misunderstandings which created some distance but after clearing that up, for a few days, we became a bit closer and he asked me if I wanted coffee but I accidentally turned that down.

Been thinking a lot about what it *really* means to **unleash your best self**. It's not about some massive, overnight transformation. It’s about the small, daily optimizations that add up. The 1% better every day.

It's about making choices that move you toward being a little happier and a little smarter.

**For a Happier You:** ✨

This is all about managing your energy and emotional state. Small daily inputs can have a huge output.

*   **The 5-Minute Reset:** Before diving into work or after a stressful meeting, just step away. Look out a window, stretch, or listen to one song. Don't scroll, just *be*. It's a circuit breaker for your brain.
*   **Acknowledge One Good Thing:** It doesn't have to be a big gratitude journal entry. Just mentally acknowledge one thing that didn't suck today. Your coffee was good? The sun came out? Someone held a door? Acknowledge it. It shifts your focus.
*   **Emotional Planning:** Sometimes the ""happier"" part feels the hardest. It's one thing to say ""be positive,"" but it's another to feel it when you're in a funk. I've found that having a structured plan can make a huge difference in managing the emotional side of self-improvement. If you're looking for something more guided, I've been really impressed by **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** for creating a personal emotional support plan.

**For a Smarter You:** 🧠

This isn't about becoming a genius; it's about keeping your mind sharp and engaged.

*   **Learn Something Unrelated:** Spend 10 minutes learning about something totally outside your field. How do black holes work? What's the history of a random country? It builds new neural pathways.
*   **Explain It Simply:** Take a complex idea you're working with and try to explain it in your head as if you were talking to a 10-year-old. This forces you to understand it on a fundamental level.
*   **Ask ""Why?"" One More Time:** When you think you have an answer to something, ask ""why?"" one more time. Digging that extra layer deeper is where real insight comes from.

It's wild how these tiny daily shifts can compound over time. The person you are in six months is being built by the tiny things you're doing today. 🚀",1,1764125084.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1p6w7t0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1p6w7t0/bizarre_and_vivid_dream/,Bizarre and vivid dream,"Last night, I had the most bizarre dream which is still vivid 8 hours later. For background, I live alone with my husband, no kids, in a single-storey house.

In the dream, I lived with my husband in a two-storey house with the ground floor largely devoted to games with bubblegum machines etc, either because my dream-husband had lots of grandkids, or we lived with a third person who had lots of grandkids; this part was unclear. 

In the dream, I woke up and went downstairs to make coffee and found lots of strangers in the house playing games. I walked outside and there were more strangers sitting at outdoor tables. I was furious, walked back inside the house and confronted a man, screaming, ""What the Hell are you doing in my house?!?"" He responded, ""I've had a hard life."" I stomped into my office to call the police, but my mobile had been replaced with a 1950's-style Bakelite rotary phone. 

By the time I'd finished the call, the police had arrived and were ushering the interlopers out. I was still angry because I thought the police were being too gentle and I wanted someone arrested. A police officer told me, ""I know this guy, I found him last week with an unlicensed prostitute"". As I left the room, I saw an ice-cream parlour in the corner which I hadn't noticed before, staffed by a young woman in a pink uniform. She gestured to the freezer cabinet and said, ""They've eaten half the ice-cream."" I looked again and saw that she was a young Katy Perry.

Then the house raised itself from its foundations and hurtled through the night sky, landing gently in a grassy meadow. I was standing by the open front door when an elderly man dressed a bit like Uncle Sam walked along the corridor towards me. I asked him where we were; he replied ""This is Norway."" I looked out over the meadow and saw a landscape with water falling over rocks. I realised I'd seen this before — then I realised that *this was actually stock footage.*

Then a second eccentrically-dressed man walked across the meadow towards me. The Uncle Sam character introduced him as the dance instructor for the British Royal Family. We shook hands, then the second man held out an Arthur Murray-style dance instruction sheet with numbered footprints towards me. I wondered if he was going to teach me how to dance.

Then I woke up.",1,1764124775.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

What I don't understand is why the reaction to this is banning ALL AI generated content. Shouldn't people at least try to, you know, confirm if the content is useful / real first? Like a piece of code written with AI wasn't written by human hands, but that doesn't mean it doesn't work. A recipe generated by AI may not have been made by a chef with years of training, but it can still be tasty.

I asked Gemini 3 yesterday- ""Yo, I really like milk tea. There's a coffee bar near my home that serves alcoholic coffee beverages, and they also have milk tea, but they don't serve an alcoholic version. I'd love to have an alcoholic milk tea to drink there when drinking with friends.""

Gemini 3 asked ""Does the coffee bar carry Kahlúa? Ask the bartender to make you a custom Kahlúa Milk Tea. It may cost you a bit extra, since it's off-menu, but it's worth trying if it fits your budget.""

Now, I could have taken this as AI Slop and ignored it, but I didn't. I went to the coffee bar, asked if they could make me a Kahlúa Milk Tea, paid a little extra for the amount of Kahlúa they added, and holy shit, it's my favorite drink now. Like a Kahlúa Milk, but sweeter and with the aroma of tea. This is what I'll be ordering every time I return to that cafe.

Why can't more people take the latter approach? Just... try it. If it sucks or doesn't work, it's AI slop and delete it. But it might just be something useful, even if it's not state-of-the-art.",31,1764124632.0,accelerate,13,0.94,False

He was beyond caring and compassionate towards me and definitely helped me out of a variety of situations over the years. He was the first person that made me feel like my life had value behind it because of the way he loved me, we had all of these wild adventures together and memories from drunk nights at the lake at 2 AM. It was like he was a piece of me I didn’t know I needed. When I moved across states, long distance became hard for both of us - both of us wanted to continue but the reality was we weren’t down the street from each other anymore. As we shifted apart I would still go back home to visit family and since he was apart of my friend group I would see him all the time and as a group we would still have mini adventures to the coast or late night coffee at Dennys. A lot of my life then felt like a Movie. Even after we broke up, he never dated another girl and one of our mutual friends told me he had told him it was because he hadn’t been able to get over me. Years passed and I got married, and it went up in flames. My husband had been treating me horribly and when everyone found out (same friend group) this guy I dated stepped in and helped me pack my things and helped me move no questions asked. Before he left the last day of helping me move I asked him why he was still willing to help me after all this time and he said because it’s important that he sees me happy.

Everytime I try dating now, I think of him. It could be the nicest guy but I still have all these memories of this guy I used to love. I don’t know if it’s because of the familiarity and when I get scared I naturally go back to thinking of someone who made me feel loved or something else. But I met this guy who is an absolute dream, he is everything I’ve wanted on paper to a T. But I’m scared because it’s all so new I haven’t really dated outside of this guy and my husband and I feel horrible because I have these little memories floating in the back of mind of this guy I used to love",1,1764124519.0,confessions,1,0.67,False

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Ideally you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

German Chocolate Cake, Chocolate Cream Pie or Cherry Pie?","All three of these were firsts for me as in I’ve never tried these recipes lol, they were a vision in my head and I winged it but they came together really well, or at least I think they did. Last time I made a German chocolate cake it was a pound cake and it was so effing (idk if I can swear) ugly that I knew I had to do it differently this time and I think it looks pretty dang cute for a German chocolate cake.

Anyways, here’s the recipes, hope y’all like them and if you have any questions, please feel free to ask:

German Chocolate Cake

German Chocolate Filling:

•1/2 cup salted butter

•1 cup evaporated milk

•1 cup brown sugar

•3 eggs

•1 tsp vanilla extract

•1 1/2 cups flaked coconut (sweetened)

•1 cup pecans, finely chopped

In a saucepan, over medium heat, melt the butter, then add the evaporated milk, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla. Continue mixing until the mixture thickens, careful not to let it curdle (if it does, it’s easily fixable, mine did and I fixed it, see note). Remove from the heat and pour in the pecans and coconut. 

Allow to cool completely and then refrigerate until solidified (4-6 hours).

Chocolate Bundt Cake:

•1 chocolate cake mix (ignore box ingredients)

•3oz dry chocolate pudding mix 

•4 eggs

•1/2 cup salted butter, melted 

•1 cup sour cream

•1/2 cup black coffee

Mix together the cake and pudding mix, then add in the remaining ingredients and mix until fully combined, careful not to over mix. Then pour into a greased and floured bundt pan and bake at 350° until a toothpick, when inserted  into the middle, comes out with slightly damp crumbs, not clean but not wet (30-40 minutes). Allow to cool for 15 minutes & remove from pan. Then allow to cool completely.

Ganache Drizzle:

•1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips

•1/4 cup heavy cream

Heat up the heavy cream, pour over the chocolate chips, allow the chocolate chips to melt/get soft and then combine until smooth. Set aside.

For assembly, put the filling into a piping bag and pipe lines going from the outer edge and into the middle. Then, smooth out the center using a spoon or spatula. Then, add a thin drizzle of the ganache on top, this is easiest to do with a piping bag/Ziploc bag. (This cake needs to remain refrigerated).

Then, eat up! Hope y’all enjoy! 

Chocolate Cream Pie

Pie Crust (makes 3, this recipe will use 1)

Mix together: 

•3 cups AP flour

•1 tsp baking powder

•2 tsp salt

Add to flour mixture and pinch/mix in, leaving small chunks of butter throughout:

•1 1/3 c salted butter, cold and cubed

Mix together & pour over the dry mix and combine until a dough forms: 

•1 egg

•1 tbsp apple cider vinegar 

•5 tbsp cold water

Form into a dough ball and divide into 3 crusts, leave one out to use and refrigerate or freeze the others.

Roll out to desired thickness and place into a 9-inch pie plate. Pike with a fork and crimp the edges. Place parchment paper down in the pie plate, pour in baking weights (dry rice or beans works too). 

Then, bake at 425° for 15 minutes, remove the baking weights and parchment paper and bake at 350° until the crust is baked all the way through and browned. Allow to cool completely.

Chocolate Cream Filling:

•1 cup heavy cream

•2 tbsp powdered sugar 

•1 tsp vanilla extract

•1/2 cup chocolate chips

•1/4 cup heavy cream

Whip together the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla until stiff peaks form. Set aside.

Heat up the heavy cream, pour over the chocolate chips, allow the chocolate chips to melt/get soft and then combine until smooth. 

Fold the chocolate mixture into the whipped cream until completely combined. You have to fold it in or else it will break and be gritty/curdled. And pour into the baked and cooked pie crust and set aside.

Whipped Cream & Toppings:

•1 cup heavy cream

•1/4 cup powdered sugar

•1 tsp vanilla extract

•Chocolate bar shavings, for topping

Whip together the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form. Place on top of the filled pie and top with the chocolate shavings. Refrigerate for 4-6 hours or overnight and serve. Hope y’all enjoy!

Cherry Pie:

Pie Crust (makes 3, this recipe will use 2)

Mix together: 

•3 cups AP flour

•1 tsp baking powder

•2 tsp salt

Add to flour mixture and pinch/mix in, leaving small chunks of butter throughout:

•1 1/3 c salted butter, cold and cubed

Mix together & pour over the dry mix and combine until a dough forms: 

•1 egg

•1 tbsp apple cider vinegar 

•5 tbsp cold water

Form into a dough ball and divide into 3 crusts, leave two out to use and refrigerate or freeze the other.

Roll out one to your desired thickness and place into a 9-inch pie plate. Poke with a fork and set aside. The other pie crust will be used for the top crust/lattice.

Cherry Filling:

•2 lbs dark pitted frozen cherries, thawed

•1 cup sugar

•1 tbsp lemon juice

•2 tbsp salted butter

•1/4 cup tart Cherry juice

•cornstarch slurry (5 tbsp cornstarch + 2 tbsp tart Cherry juice combined) 

•1 tsp cinnamon

In a medium sized saucepan over medium heat, add in the cherries, sugar, lemon juice, butter, and Cherry juice. Allow that to come to a simmer and let the cherries soften. Then, add in the cornstarch slurry and mix until thickened. Then, remove from heat and add in the cinnamon and mix until combined. Allow to cool.

Then, roll the second pie crust out and either leave whole or cut into strips for a latticed top crust. If doing a whole crust, you’ll place it on top and do little slits for the filling to vent and cook and not explode (we’re not trying to be SpongeBob here). 

Once the filling has cooled, add to the bottom crust, place whatever top crust you want. Brush with an egg wash (1 egg + 1 tbsp of water mixed) and some turbinado sugar. Bake for 15 minutes at 425° and then reduce the heat to 350° for 40-50 minutes. 

Hope y’all enjoy!

Simultaneously, I would like to practice my Deutsch(I have currently B1, and now taking B2 course)as much as possible. I’m open to any other proposals, like drinking a cup of tea or coffee anywhere.",0,1764123723.0,berlinsocialclub,1,0.5,False
