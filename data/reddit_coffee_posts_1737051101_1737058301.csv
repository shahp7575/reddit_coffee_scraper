Hello I’m 41F and based in the UK and looking for new friends and what better friends to have than Harry Potter friends, I don’t know where to look or how to look really, how do I find groups or even just casual meet ups over a coffee or cuppa.

I'm 37 and 100 pounds overweight and have been heavy my entire life. I have also been on the cusp with prediabetic readings around 6.0-6.4 as far back as I can remember. I have eaten pretty crazy and stressed the last 3 months and my last A1C test was last year and was in prediabetic range. The morning before the test I had drank two cups of coffee with some sugar and creamer but did not eat anything. My new doctor said I was in the diabetic range but did not diagnose me with diabetes. Said we works retest in 3 months...

I'm confused. Am I now a diabetic? Or was my A1C higher due to the sugar I had consumed? If the next test is back to my ""normal"" levels will I be considered a controlled Type 2 diabetic or will I just be prediabetic like always? She only ""prescribed"" me a diet plan and exercise plan and said return in 3 months. I have never seen this doctor before but am establishing new primary care in a new state and my previous doctor sent over my last few years of tests. Maybe the elevation is why I wasn't officially diagnosed? Or maybe I'm on the cusp?

I have so many questions and fears now, but this ultimately is my fault, so I gotta slap myself and get to work. If I can avoid an official diagnosis I will do everything in my power to do so. I just don't know how to explain this when the test was .2 points in to diabetic and she did not immediately say ""You have Diabetes""..",1,1737058125.0,diabetes_t2,0,1.0,False

1i2y13l,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_babydiorr01/comments/1i2y13l/i_f18_found_out_my_dad_isnt_my_dad_and_everyone/,"i (f18) found out my dad isn’t my dad, and everyone knew but me. ","i originally posted this to a different group, hence why there’s already updates. but going forward i will be updating here as well, i just wanted to add it to a different group to get other feedback. 

****fake names****
for some context, my moms (F37) maiden name is Mary Murphy and my dads (M49) name is Dave Miller. my name (F18) is Brianna Santiago, but when i was born it was Brianna Torres. my parents changed it when i was young, but i was old enough to have already learned to spell Santiago and all that. so my whole life i’ve had suspicions abt my dad not being my dad for a few reasons. 
1. my last name 
2. i asked my grandpa (moms dad)  when i was young (about 5 or 6) if my dad was my dad, and he said “that’s for your mom to tell you” 
3. i asked my older half brother (M24) (on my dads side) when i was young (also 5 or 6 which would make him about 12) if he held me when i was a baby and he told me he didn’t meet me till i was 2. 
i didn’t wanna say anything bc if it wasn’t true and Dave really was my dad, id look stupid. i’ve asked my mom where my last name came from (again about age 5 or 6) and she told me she made it up and i believed her. i never spoke about it again to them. for a few weeks now, ive been thinking that i was gonna talk to my mom abt it since im 18 now. i came to work this morning and talked to a few coworkers about it (they are both in their 40 or 50s and one of them, Ellie, sort of knew my mom). when i told them, Ellie said “yeah i knew your mom was with someone else and had you before she got with Dave” and im like holy shit. so i texted my older brother (the one i mentioned before) and asked if he knew, and he said yes, but he didn’t think it mattered, and that they all love me like blood. on my lunch break i went on my facebook blocked list and saw a guy named “Mario Torres” was blocked. and i didn’t do it. so i was like wow this is my dad. i went through his whole facebook and looked at his new family. He has one daughter and they live on a farm with horses. he graduated in 1988 tho, which is one year after my mom was born, making him about 17 years older than my mom. should I reach out? should i talk to my mom THEN reach out? or should i not reach out at all? 

***update***
i was going to talk to my mom that night but she works nights and had already left for work when i got home. so i talked to her tonight. i asked her to tell me the story of my real dad. she told me he was abusive and beat the shit out of me and her. he also kept track of her miles to make sure she wasn’t cheating and would hit her if she went over her “limit”, even if it was to just get a coffee. there’s a lot of other details and stories she told me but i’ll keep it short. he was very very controlling and abusive. my mom left & Dave adopted me when i was 3 and has been my dad since. when me & my mom were talking she’s like “i knew you might hate me for keeping it from you for 18 years & i didn’t want you to hold a grudge against your dad” & i just explained that im not mad at either of them. just my bio dad. and ts js makes me respect Dave so much more bc he didn’t have to be my dad. he chose me yk. i then showed my mom Mario’s profile and told her this is how i found him. and she’s like “idk who that is” MARIO WAS NOT MY DAD LMFAOOO. so i asked what his name was and she told me Luis Santiago. so why Mario was blocked idk but i looked up Luis and he hasn’t posted in a few years, but i found his kids, my siblings, on social media. i texted my sister (F24) on instagram, which she hasn’t replied to. i texted my brother (M20) on messenger, which he also hasn’t replied to yet, and i also texted my oldest brother (M26) on messenger & he replied right away. 

***UPDATE #2***

after a few days of texting my brother, he invited me to his house to meet him. obviously i’m not comfortable with this man, considering i don’t know him, so i made sure i brought protective items and told a few of my friends where i was going and what i was doing, along with sharing my location with them. i didn’t necessarily think anything bad was gonna happen, but i was still scared bc i was going to meet up with a 26 year old man in his house alone. anyways i went and we just talked for a few hours. he told me he remembers me and my mom living with them, but thought my mom was already pregnant when she started coming around. this confused me but as soon as i found out Dave wasn’t my dad, i ordered an ancestry kit with priority processing. i got the kit 2 weeks later, spit in the tube, and sent it back. it arrived at the lab a few days ago, so now i wait 2-4 weeks to get my results. anyways, im not gonna freak out about that yet, because i have test results coming soon, and he was only about 8 years old. after talking for a while, we realized his best friend is my step brother (M24). my- who i thought was my dad, Dave, got divorced with mom and married to another woman, who had an older son. he then called my step brother to tell him, and he said he already knew, and thought my brother knew. as of right now, my brother and i snap often, and hung out just that one time. i’m just waiting for my ancestry results to confirm that Luis is in fact my father, and then to also just learn more about the parts of my life that i didn’t know. anyways, i know this has been long, and don’t know what i expect from anyone reading. i guess i just want some advice or what would you do. i can update after my results, if that’s something anyone is interested in hearing. thank you for reading and giving me feedback and advice. all is appreciated.

In this post, I want to share how it happened so it doesn't happen to you. 

It all started with a Tinder Match:  

I matched with a girl called Kristina on Tinder, a beautiful Polish Brunette. 

Mind you I live in Tallinn, Estonia... (This will be relevant for later) 

After we matched together, we had a few back and forths and I asked her what brought her here, she told me that she moved here for work etc.  

Then I proposed that we continue the conversations on Instagram but she told me that she doesn't have Instagram but uses Telegram so we exchanged Telegram. 

I'm usually good at avoiding traps.   
  
We started chatting, and she seemed a bit reserved at first.   
  
The conversation stretched over two or three days, and it didn't feel like a scam.   
  
There was no pressure to do anything; it felt like a typical chat where a guy had to put in some effort to get a date. So, I asked if she'd like to meet up, and she said yes. 

She asked me what I had in mind? And I told her that we could go to this beautiful bar with a nice view of the city around 9 pm. 

She said that 9 pm was too late so she asked me if we could do it at 6 pm instead, I tried to negotiate saying that I had to work and that it would be preferable to meet after 8 pm. 

She insisted that it's a bit too late and we then agreed to have a coffee instead around 6 PM. 

Then she said that there was this opera show that she wanted to check out called Wicked at 7 PM and that she would love to go after. 

At this point, in my head, I was thinking that going to an opera show for a first date was a bit of a stretch and that it would be better to keep it simple. 

But then after a while she told me that it would make the date more unique and that she could get her ticket herself and that I could buy my own. (That made me think that she probably wasn't a gold digger, so in my head, I started to think that it might actually be a cool experience to have a different type of date). 

She tells me that she's going to order hers because there are limited seats and the show will only be available on that date. She sends a receipt of her ticket confirmation, everything looks legit. 

I go to the website she sent and I start checking everything to see, everything looks legit, there's even the legit address of the opera in Tallinn on the website with all the shows available.

[This is what the site looked like. ](https://preview.redd.it/qs40jddosede1.png?width=1834&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd96b95f614fe17f68d4e01b41fba81fa35f0054)

  
She told me that she took seat E3 and she sent me a booking confirmation and told me that I could take seat F3 next to her.   


https://preview.redd.it/dd1seq56vede1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=40b8bfe1862645328132805b1d527b1bfea5f5ae

It has a standard booking form with everything. 

And I go to the payment page to check. 

[This is the payment page](https://preview.redd.it/ohlp3oy9tede1.png?width=1627&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb95a29c2306d0c3f17f6a9e25a3210a13a7eb4f)

  
I entered my card info and then it asked me for a code which I gave but then it gave me an error message that the code was incorrect.

They told me I should try again and tried again and again and again. 

Eventually, I reached out to support and they told me I needed to type faster and put the code faster I tried again and also made sure that the 4-digit code was the right one. 

But then after trying a bunch of times, I checked my bank account to see if the charge was actually taken or not because it kept sending me errors. 

And that's when I found out that they took multiple payments. 

So then I reached out to support asking them to retrieve the payment and to let me do it again once these payments are refunded. 

But that's when they asked me for another link with a refund form to enter my card again, at that point I knew it was a scam.   


[This is the money that got scammed. ](https://preview.redd.it/ob3a9lqvoede1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d0906b8ba81b9580231e2a08e4d96efb010f42c)

  
Then when I started talking to the girl again, she started asking me questions, looking worried and telling me that I should try again and that it should work since she got her ticket. 

But I already knew it was a scam, I asked to have a call with her but then she blocked me after a few minutes. 

And this is how I got scammed. 

Be careful out there.

I feign nonchalance as my mind goes blank. How do you tell a story you don’t like the ending of? People say you shouldn’t say anything negative about your past relationships when dating, that you should keep it surface level. Or better yet, don’t talk about anything traumatic at all. They say, “What’s the point? What do you want them to say? Do you want their sympathy, their condolences at best? For them to see you differently, or use it against you at worst?” No, I don’t want that —but something hopeful still cautiously stirs in my chest at the idea of you seeing me fully. I don’t want to hide entire swaths of my life or things that have left lasting impressions on my soul. To hide these things feels like dishonesty. And frankly, dishonesty leaves a taste I can’t stomach anymore.

So how do you tell a story you don’t like the ending of? You could keep it brief. At first it was good, then it was bad, and for a relatively brief stint, things were really quite horrific. But when your visit to the bad lasts too long, you lose the ability to assess just how *bad,* bad is. You exist in a vacuum, severed from reality, unreachable even to yourself. You wander a dingy, dark carnival’s hall of mirrors where every step forward is accompanied by paranoia and the knowledge that you are not alone, you are not safe. Something is lurking in the shadows, something familiar, something that has proven itself to be a very real threat. There is no peace, yet there is the acceptance that this is your normal. And so you spend your stretch of eternity in a sunless limbo, surrounded by half-forgotten indulgences that dull your longing to leave. You have lost touch - with the nervous excitement of a first date, with huddled conversations over cups of coffee, with the peaceful din of a warm cafe - with everyone who does not traverse the hall of mirrors with you. There’s a sick bond you form with those that are there with you. Even if they are the ones jumping out at you.

I look at you from across a cafe table, steaming mugs of coffee in our hands, and I can’t help but think that the simple pleasure of this moment is too sweet to break. I really did try to find the words for you. I wanted to tell you, to invite you in and let you see it all — every ugly truth and frayed edge. But when I opened my mouth, I lost grip of the thread that tied it all together in a neat package, and all the contents of those four years spilled out into my mind as singular moments, formless and disjointed. I wanted to tell you, but when I opened my mouth, my breath hitched and all I could say was, “We just weren’t right for each other anymore.”",1,1737057935.0,prose,0,1.0,False

1i2xxvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i2xxvm/27_no_car_very_little_savings_how_to_stop/,"27, no car, very little savings. How to stop comparing myself to my friends?","How do I stop comparing myself to others? I came from a very poor family who kicked me out when I was 18. No money, no plan, etc. since then I’ve been struggling to “get my money up” and I’ve always felt like I’m a few steps behind in life. 

Last year I decided to go back to school so I quit my job to work as a barista since the coffee company I now work for covers tuition costs. I get so embarrassed telling people I’m a barista because most of the people I work with are way younger than me. 

I also don’t have a car because mine broke down 6 months ago so I ride public transportation (which is really dirty and looked down upon here) I can feel peoples judgements when they find out.. sometimes they look confused or sad for me. 

I’ve also been too afraid to date because I’m way to fucking embarrassed and scared to get rejected for being where I’m at in life. I don’t blame people for wanting a partner who is financially stable at my age. 

Overall I feel like a fuck up and when I hear that my friends are buying expensive things I feel so behind. How do I stop comparing myself to them and become happy(or at least okay) with where I’m at in life? It eats away at me. Sometimes I can’t even sleep because I get so much anxiety about how people perceive me. ",1,1737057889.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Decided since it was a new year I should upgrade my setup, glad I did! 

Thanks to this group for helping me choose between the Apex and Gaggia Classic Pro, I decided to go with the apex since it has a bigger tank allowing me to do more back-to-back shots. The casabrews was decent in the begging but need to constantly wait for the temp for those extra shots in the morning. 

I know the grinder is more important than the machine itself so it was between the Specialita and the DF54. I went with the Eureka since I do 4-7 shots a day and its makes it quick and easy for me to just grind them. It might sound a lot of shots for one person but this is for an office of 4 people.

1i2xonq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Malliem/comments/1i2xonq/every_full_moon_my_friends_lock_me_in_my_room_i/,"Every full moon, my friends lock me in my room. I wish I never found out the reason why. Part 8 (1/2)","There was a voice.

“Hey, Nin?”

It was a memory, back when things made sense, back when my life was warm. 

It was still scary and confusing, but parts of me were coming clear. 

When running away was still an option we never took.

I immediately recognized it.

I recognized my own voice.

We were in the kitchen. I was making breakfast, and Rowan was perched idly on the countertop, swinging his legs, a cigarette dangling from his mouth.

Wrapped up in his robe, my roommate resembled a pouting toddler. Rowan was acting like a man-child, but he was getting better, which was progress.

When I slumped down with a bowl of oatmeal and a coffee, I figured entertaining his presence would be better than ignoring him, which had been my initial plan.

“Good morning.” I said, risking a sip of iced tea. 

I was still struggling with the whole *eating while my roommates ate ME thing*.

Rowan scoffed, exhaling a cloud of smoke. 

His eyes found the pitch black sky vacant of the sun, lips curling around the cigarette. Rowan Beck was the main character in his own mind. “*Is* it though?”

“Hey, Nin, can you grab my lunch from the refrigerator?” Kaz stuck his head through the gap in the door. He was half-dressed in boxers and nothing else. 

I pretended not to notice Rowan’s eyes almost popping out of his head.

“Put that *out*,” Kaz ordered, and to my surprise, Rowan completely lost his stone-cold demeanor, jumping up and immediately spitting out the cigarette.

I couldn’t tell if it was a reaction to Kaz randomly showing up half-naked, or if he just wasn’t allowed to smoke. Either way, looking at the two of them—and knowing their past—the stoner vegetarian was definitely the one who called the shots.

I focused on my oatmeal, willing myself to stick it in my mouth and chew. It wasn’t exactly hard, per se.

The hard part came when my cannibal roommates started preparing their own breakfast, which was a varied selection of my internal organs. Kaz set it up like a meat platter on the countertop, like I really was café-de-Nin.

Rowan was more discreet, blending me into a smoothie. I wasn’t a fan of him sitting there, legs swinging, downing it like it was chocolate.

His weird moans when he swiped at his lips needed to be studied. I was already swallowing the barf creeping back up my throat in a thick paste. I really wanted that morning to be nausea-free, but I was already inching toward the bathroom, my body betraying me.

“Dude.” Kaz stood impatiently in the doorway, running his hands through his hair. “Grab me my lunch. It’s the Tupperware on the top shelf with the blended brains.” 

He nodded to the refrigerator, and I caught the subtle smirk he and Rowan shared.

When Imogen came crashing in wearing nothing but a towel, she too shot the boys a devilish grin.

Oh.

Rowan avoided my gaze, slurping my liquidized intestines.

Oh, it was a test, huh?

I risked a glance at Immie, who situated herself next to Rowan, leaping onto the counter. He tried to shove her off, grumbling, “I got here first.” But Imogen Prairie was not a morning person—and after receiving the mother of all death glares, he turned his attention back to me.

It *was* a test.

I stood up, my legs already wobbling, and strode over to the refrigerator. I had been dreading what was inside ever since discovering my roommates’ unusual diet. 

In fact, I had nightmares about what they were hiding. Still, if I was going to be a Bolivia House resident, I had no choice but to get used to their “food.” I squeezed my eyes shut, reaching blindly for something that felt like plastic. I was already struggling, and their laughter didn't help. 

“It's not funny.” I hissed, pawing for anything that felt like a container. 

“Oh, but it *is*.” Rowan chuckled, and I had to bite back a hiss. 

They were acting like children. 

“Fuck off, Rowan.” 

His response was a giggle. “Nah. I like watching you squirm.”

“That’s cheating,” Kaz said, when I knocked a soda can over. “Come on, Nin. You’ve gotta suck it up at some point.”

“It’s my blended organs,” I managed through gritted teeth.

“Yes,” Rowan said, “and they fucking slap.”

“Rowan.” Imogen chastized, but she did catch my eye, her lips forming a smile. 

“They kinda *do*, though.”

Kaz’s “lunch” was neatly placed on top of some  half eaten hummus. I had to swallow the puke creeping back up my throat. I could see my slimy scarlet remains mushed into a sort of burger patty. Somehow, it didn’t surprise me that Kaz was already trying different recipes with my discarded flesh. 

While Rowan and Imogen were actual fucking savages, raw-dogging my poor emaciated corpse. 

Maintaining a smile, I pulled it out, held it at arm’s length, and shoved it into Kaz’s bare chest.

“Your *lunch*, my lord,” I mockingly bowed, managing a gritted smile, and his eyes lit up, his lazy smirk breaking out into a grin. 

Imogen squealed, clapping like I’d won an award.

“She did it!”

Rowan groaned, leaning back. “And, *this*, my friends, is why everyone thinks we’re weird.”

I wasn’t expecting Kaz to hug me, wrapping his arms around me. Imogen hopped off the counter and joined in.

Rowan watched idly, his eyes already mid-roll.

Still, though, he was halfway off of the counter, like he was about to join us. 

He changed his mind when I met his gaze, his mouth forming a scowl. “Get a room.”

When Kaz left to find clothes, Imogen disappeared into the lounge to play video games, I was left with Rowan—and his flask.

He kept playing with it, swinging it between his fingers. 

“Nin.”

Rowan said my name more like a cough.

Somehow, I knew exactly what he was going to say. 

Call it intuition, or maybe I was more entangled with my roommates than I thought.

“Don’t say it,” I said, stirring my oatmeal into an unappetizing mush.

“If she… you know, gets in my head—like really gets in my head—I’m talking full-on fucking possession and never coming back, like totally mind-controlled minion—”

“I get it, Rowan.”

“Yeah.” He heaved out a breath, and suddenly his voice was so small, so vulnerable, choking up. He slowly slid off the counter, and proximity was suddenly incredibly close, his breath in my face.

“Look, I know we’re dangerous, and I know we’re fucked up with the whole, uhh, partial moon possession, or whatever—but I want to be selfish.” His voice shattered into a laugh, though it was more of a sob. 

“You’re right! You’ve been right this whole fucking time, and you didn’t say it out loud because she showed you, just like she showed me.” I wasn't expecting him to be so soft, gentle. I could put it down to him being moon drunk, but this was different. 

This was raw, vulnerable Rowan. 

“When you left us, it was human nature to run—to survive, and it'll take a while for me to fully understand it, but the raw, human part of me knows exactly why you did it.” 

He held out his hand, and I took them, letting him squeeze my fingers.

“I know why you ran, and I don’t fucking hate you for it,” he whispered, and part of me also broke, right there, squeezing his hands for dear life. “So.” Rowan’s voice broke into a sob. “Can you let *me* be selfish this time?” His eyes reflected her light, and I wondered if she was listening.

His lips formed a smirk, and it was there at that moment, that I knew it would always be him. The pretentious, self-righteous boy who built walls around himself to avoid getting hurt– and who still couldn't understand *why* I left him to be brutally killed. 

He was as fucking selfish as me– as human as me. 

“Because *if* it comes down to saving this town from plunging into darkness under this werewolf worshipping cult, or saving me, Kaz, and Imogen,” Rowan’s nails bit into my skin. I felt his desperation to stay alive, that self preservation he tried so hard to hide. 

“I want you to choose us.”

. 

*“Wakey, wakey! Thaem xor virak talor.”*

Ice-cold lips found my ear, a breathy laugh dancing across the flesh of my neck. Teeth lightly nibbled, gnawing down my naked  spine as if they were starving—teasing, yet never breaking the skin, running their tongue and lapping up my sweat. I could feel their maniacal grin, their face buried in the back of my neck, warm saliva pooling on my skin. I sensed their exaggerated moan, breathing all of me in. ""Xor viera vaelos Nin.""

I woke up screaming.

Pain—no, agony—was already igniting every nerve ending, setting my body on fire.

My bones were twisting and snapping, reforming, my spine contorting under my writhing flesh, an invasive itch I couldn't scratch. *Oh god, like something was under my skin, buried deep inside me, fighting to get out.* 

I was screaming before I was awake, my lips already parted, warm, bubbling wetness filling my mouth, the scent of rusty coins invading my nostrils. 

Even half-awake, I already knew I had been ripped apart, shredded from the inside. My throat was raw, scorched and dry from screeching. Opening my eyes was a bad idea. I was blinded by a heavenly glow bathing my face, burning me, stripping the flesh off my bones. That's why I was screaming—why I couldn't *stop* screaming. Why my body tossed left to right, wriggling and writhing under its cruel, celestial glare. What happened? 

The words were entangled in my mind, barely coherent. 

I was inside Bolivia House, inside my room, a photo of a baby in my hands—a baby that didn't make sense. 

I didn't have a baby, and never *wanted* a baby. So why did looking at it feel right? 

Why did I feel longing for a child that did not exist? I remembered something hitting the back of my head, followed by voices, looming figures, and familiar blonde curls tickling my cheeks.

Kaz, Imogen, and Rowan hovering over me. 

What… happened to me? Where did they go? 

Presently, through flickering lashes, I could make out Bolivia House’s skylight, and something ice-cold trickled down my spine, and something like déjà vu slammed into me. I was back where it all began—where everything went wrong. 

I could sense it, feel it, like a living entity creeping across the flesh of my face and down my neck, wrapping around my spine.

The light was all too familiar but stronger—stronger than it had ever been—enrapturing my housemates' eyes and dancing across the sky: a sentient, beautiful light that turned them into monsters. 

This time, though, it was in my eyes, drowning them, polluting them, filling my vision with mesmerizing luminescence I couldn't look away from. Burning me.

Inside out. 

Taking slow breaths didn't help; my screams ripped from me like they weren't mine, like I was possessed. 

I was… bleeding out.

That was my first real thought when my eyes flickered open once again, and the first thing I did was choke up lumps while streaks of scarlet trickling from my lips, my head jerking, clanging against something cold and metallic. I was lying on something. 

Was it a bed? 

No. It was too hard. Like lying on concrete. 

When clarity started to hit me, so did awareness. I tried to roll onto my face to relieve the burning, but I couldn't move. 

I was strapped to a table, my wrists pinned down. 

The blood choking my mouth tasted familiar. 

I almost swallowed a coin as a kid. I was bored, playing in my room, when the childish thought struck me, my gaze glued to a quarter cupped in my hand.

I didn't think, placing it on my tongue, and immediately spat it out. I remember choking on the now familiar taste, a thick, metallic tint that settled on my tongue. *”What are you doing?”*

The voice was familiar to my little-self, but my present self rejected it, a monstrous screech clawing from my lips– one that I couldn't control, that crept from deep within the recesses of my mind, ripping the air from my lungs. 

I was already speaking, whimpering, the words tangled and wrong, slipping from my lips. No. I screamed into darkness, trying to rip myself from the memory. But it was relentless, already pulling me, plunging me into twisting oblivion. 

This voice was a stranger to me– and yet, all of me, my contorting and writhing mind and thoughts of my two hundredth body, *did* know it. 
 
I was in my childhood bedroom, next to me, a blurry figure. 

They smelled like… raspberry pudding and the air before rain. 

*”You're not *allowed* to put coins in your mouth,”* the figure with no face stated matter-of-factly. With the memory struggling to paint a real picture, I only saw a moving blur. It was a kid. Same age. 

I could just about glimpse a threadbare t-shirt with a Spider-Man logo, and odd socks. The further I teetered on the edge of the memory, details started to blossom. 

I had a *Totally Spies!* themed lamp on my beside, and plastic stars twinkling on my ceiling. 

The blurry figure folded their arms. “I thought you were playing dollhouses?”

My younger self flopped onto bright pink carpet, crawling over to a wooden dollhouse. “I am.” I said. “Do you want to be the baby?” 

“No.” The blurry figure grumbled. “I don't like being the baby. The baby is *stupid*.”

I grabbed a pink-haired barbie and thrust it in their face. “Fine. You can be Primrose!”

They sighed, dropping onto their knees,  and making the doll dance across my fluffy rug. “Okay, but *only* if Primrose is a spy.”
 
“But we played Spies last time!” I grumbled. 

“Yeah, so? I like it. I don't like playing Hospitals, or Mommy and Daddy, or Doctor Nina. I want them to be super spies.”

“They're not spies,” I shoved the blurry figure, my voice breaking. “They're *my* toys.”

“But all your ideas are boring!”

When they jumped up, kicking over my dollhouse, I got another glimpse of this stranger, this enigma in my head– that my body knew, and my brain didn't. “I want to play spies, where Primrose and Barbie are kidnapped by an evil professor and turned into pigs, and then they became super pigs–”

I cut them off with a wail. *“Mom!”* 

I wasn't expecting my past cry to rip from my present lips.

Mom.

When I tried to reach for it, I couldn't. 

Whatever it was, and whoever this person had been, was trapped behind walls of my own making, towering metal sky-scrapers, completely impenetrable. But from the darkness, a name was clinging on. *Jonas is being mean. Jonas isn't letting me play. Jonas is stealing my cookie. Jonas keeps kicking me! Jonas keeps making faces!*

My voice grew older, and I found myself skimming through my childhood. There were no visual memories yet, only my voice highlighting fragments of what was lost. 

*”Mom, Jonas won't let me play on the PS3.”* 

*”Dad, can you tell Jonas to clean up after dinner?”*

This time, my voice was giggling. *”Oh my god, Jonas, what did you do to your hair? Mom is going to kill you! You're an idiot!”*

*”You smoke? Jonas, do you want to fuck up your lungs?!”*

Older. 

Sixteen, or maybe seventeen. 

""I don't want to be here, Mom,"" I said, my voice trembling. I was whispering this time. ""Neither does Jonas. I have bad feelings about this place, and when I tried to leave earlier, there were guards standing at the gate. I don't think they want us to leave.”

I was being catapulted further through my life, and yet there was no anchor to cling onto. 

Only memories in the form of my own voice slamming into me like needles. 

My voice was suddenly so small, like a child. *”Mommy, please don't do this to us. I want to go home. I don't want to do this.”

My younger self broke, and then she *kept* breaking, over and over again, splintering into tiny pieces. Fragments of my voice began to come through, a tidal wave of screams, begging and pleading, and breaking. 

*”It's a cult, Mom.” somehow, my voice was still strong, still holding on. “Can't you fucking understand? They're not letting us go, and they're *never* going to let us go! You need to listen to me okay? No, Mom, don't look over there, look at me! Please! Look at me!”

I heard the sound of my palm slapping my mother’s cheek. 

“I'm sorry. I…I  didn't mean…” My voice was losing its momentum, a phantom screech hollowing out and barely breaking the sound barrier. I sensed the weakness in my bones, the mental and physical agony weighing me down– the overwhelming urge to just fucking let go. 

It was so easy.

The thought clouded my younger self’s thoughts. 

When I pressed the stolen blade to my wrist, willing myself to let go. 

But I never did. 

I always dropped it. Always let it hit the ground, clanging in my ears. 

It wasn't clear what I was seeing. 

It was pitch dark, the darkness lit up in warm candlelight. 

But I didn't feel warm. I was wobbling, struggling to stand. “Jonas.” I whispered, nudging the streak of *nothing* next to me, who quickly morphed into a young boy. 

Seventeen or eighteen. 

He shared my thick blonde hair and hollow eyes. Jonas was my brother. 

I had a *brother*.

I was standing in dirt, my feet bare, watching the latest sacrifice. 

Dressed head to toe in a long, white flowing dress that pooled at my feet, the  material made me squirm, itchy against my skin. But no matter how many times I tore it apart, Mom begged Father for forgiveness, and patched it back together. 

Jonas stood in matching white, a short sleeved shirt and clinical coloured pants that barely fit him. Mia and Teo… 

They didn't want to die. 

In front of me, there they knelt, beheaded, their blood spilling into the dirt under seeping moonlight. 

Mia and Teo had outlines. All of the children brought in by their brainwashed parents had outlines. 

Which meant…

“We’re next.”

Jonas spoke through his teeth, his gaze going to the moon poking from the clouds. 

He caught my eye, his lip wobbling. “They've filled Mom’s head with this moon bullshit, and she's going to use us as vessels.” Jonas’s gaze was glued to the sacrifice, and our mother, her head tipped back, awaiting something that was never going to happen. Mom really was gone. 

I should have seen it in the relaxed muscles in her face, her vacant eyes and wide smile. I was in denial I had lost her, until I watched my sweet mommy carve into my friend’s skin, speaking of *blessings* and ignoring their screams of pain. 

Each potential sacrifice had to have her words sliced into their arms and neck. 

I knew each one perfectly, after having them quite literally nailed into my skull. 

*Thamvi* was carved under the elbow. 

And like flowing water, the rest followed, all the way down the arm. 

Mom’s handiwork was always so perfect. 

She never showed mercy, tightening her hold on the knife, and carving deeper. 

Their skin was her canvas, their blood her paintbrush.

It took me a while to learn her language. I never knew the real one, which were the symbols that twisted my head and made my bones ache. But then Mom introduced us to what was called, “The water language,” derived from our ancestors. 

Mom said it was easy to speak it. All I had to do was find my connection with *her*. 

The moon.

“It's like talking underwater, sweetie,” she told me. 

It *was*. 

Each word was a trickling stream in my hand. 

So effortless. 

Water. 

Drip, drip, dripping. 

*Luhar*. 

*Nathur*. 

*Velilua*. 

The binding ritual. 

Scrawled on their neck, then, would be our final plea for forgiveness, and our offering of a King to serve her. *“Lunakar Velix”*

Finally, a seal sliced over their heart. *Thalix*. 

“Maybe they're right,” my brother whispered when disappointment began to flicker on Mom’s face. Unsurprisingly, Mia and Teo’s brutal murder was for nothing. 

There was no outline to carve, and no light to drown each of us. 

Jonas let out a harsh laugh, cutting into the silence. 

I found my gaze glued to the other members waiting patiently for the moon to bless them. Which was never going to happen. Mom had been kneeling in dirt, staring at the moon, for almost five hours. 

We weren't allowed to move. The children of the cult were to stand and watch. 

“Maybe they're going to do it this time,” my brother breathed, his eyes unseeing, lips parted in a silent cry. Jonas nudged me, and I tore my gaze from Mina’s headless torso buried in flowers. “Maybe we really *will* find a vessel for our celestial *King*.”

“Stop.” I gritted out. 

I hated that half smile on his lips. 

That same suffocating shadow blooming behind his eyes that I saw in my mother’s. 

”It's going to be okay, I promise,” my voice splintered into a sob, and it was visceral enough to contort my present body into an arch, slamming me back down onto the table. The memory jumped. I sensed hands entangled with mine, narrow fingers grasping for an anchor, squeezing for dear life.

“We’re going to be okay.” I whispered, and this time we were both older, his head buried in my chest, sobbing into my shirt. 

Clinging to the chains wrapped around his wrists, I pressed a kiss atop his head. 

“I've got a month before the next full moon,” Jonas whispered. “Mom is going to kill me.” He laughed, his giggles breaking into a sob. “I don't *want* to be a fucking King, Nina.”

I pulled away, refusing to look my brother– now twenty years old– in the eye. 

“That's…that's not going to happen.”

Jonas pulled his knees to his chest, and I couldn't stop myself from ripping the crown from his head… where it would stay until he stepped onto the altar, a horrific thing made up of human bone from past sacrifices cementing him as an offering. 

“Okay, so we need to think about this,” I said. “They need three vessels if they can't have you. Mom wants the King, so like, the leader, the second King, who sits by his side, and the Queen who perches on a throne of glass.” 

I paced his cell, slicing my fingers on the crown’s sharp prongs. I think somewhere along the way, spending my late teenagehood and early adulthood in a cult, part of me started to believe. 

I was already smiling, stretching my grin right across my face so I would believe my own delusion. 

When I was nineteen, we came so close. This time, we took three out of town freshman college kids.

That was the first time I saw an outline, a shadow bound to the soul. Mom really did think we had done it– before the outlines we carved splintered into nothing, the body's blood ran dry into the dirt, and the moon left us once again. 

Like she was angry. 

I wasn't going to let that happen this time.

“Throne of entrails.” Jonas corrected me. “You're thinking of a book.”

I nodded. “So, if I find three worthy and pure outlines and bring them here to offer them to their fucking ritual, they'll let us go, and we can out of here, Jonas. We can run.”

I caught myself, biting through a sob. 

I didn't *want* to betray her light. But I also didn't want to fucking *die*. 

That's how I knew the brainwashing had already ensnared part of me, and was taking an unyielding hold. I covered up the windows in my brother’s cell, blocking out the night. Then I poured all of his water out. Just in case the moon was listening in. 

“And Mom?” Jonas peered up at me with wide eyes that dared to be hopeful. 

I was aware I was crying, but my smile grew bigger. 

“We’re okay without Mom.”

Jonas shifted uncomfortably in his chains. His cell was bare. He didn't have a bed or even a blanket. Just the harsh cement wall to rest his head. “Okay, so how are you going to get over the fence? It's guarded.”

“Well, they use me as the poster child for recruiting students from my college classes,” I said, “I'll just say I've got some people interested, and I'm going to try to bring them in.” I pulled out a screwed up piece of paper.

“Mom talks about one of the last standing buildings in the town that was used for sacrifice, and she's obsessed with it: Bolivia House. It's a student house now, so we can sacrifice the residents.”

Jonas averted his gaze. 

“So, you're fine with killing three students?”

His words twisted my stomach. 

For years, I had felt a constant weight on my shoulder dragging me down, pulling the breath from my lungs. Ever since our car crashed, and the Cult of Lumine welcomed us, I thought I was going to die. 

I thought I was going to be sacrificed, my body used as a vessel, with no family, and my own mother being the one to do it. I didn't know what a family was anymore. 

It wasn't what *we* were. Jonas was distant, his broken mind so easy to influence and mould.

I could already see parts of him submitting to the moon’s spell. We didn't spend time together, locked in our rooms all night to pray to the moon. Mom barely spoke to us. In her eyes, we were not her children. Jonas and I were puppets.

When we weren't praying, we were learning her language, and what would happen when she finally took over, taking away humanity's shadow once again. 

I lost myself somewhere between watching my first sacrifice, and then my fiftieth. 

But now there was hope– and if killing three strangers saved us, then so be it. 

I could still get that family I dreamed of. Jonas and me, somewhere safe. I just had to throw away my humanity to finally be free. 

Kneeling in front of my brother and grasping for his hands and squeezing them tight, I truly believed in this future. 

“If killing these people saves us, then yes.” the words left my mouth, almost like I myself was speaking her language, like water dripping from my tongue. “I'll bring three outlines back here, and I won't look back, I won't watch the sacrifice, because me and you both know it's not going to work.”

Jonas nodded, his eyes filling with tears. 

The moon was mad at us. 

“You need to carve out their hearts first.” Jonas spoke up. “You can't make an offering without proper preparation. You need to keep them on a diet of fruit and dairy so prepare their bodies for assimilation. You can't hurt them, either. The King will only assimilate with perfection.”

Jonas’s gaze shot to me. “So, if they smoke, drink, whatever, you need to flush all that poison from them. It's toxic to him.”

I wasn't a fan of his lecturing tone, but this was better than him giving in, sleeping all day and wearing that crown. Jonas looked far more alert, even with the dark shadows underlining his eyes. “You do know what to do, right?” He held my gaze. “Remember, to properly prepare the body, you need to–”

“Carve the binding words into the arms, palm, and heart,” I said. “It's like a seal, right?”

“Yeah. It's to seal her light inside them.”

I nodded, but my stomach twisted. “I've… watched Mom do it enough times. I can do it.”

Jonas didn't look at me. “Do you know how to sever?”

I frowned. “Sever?”

“In case you change your mind,” Jonas spoke softly. “Do you know how to sever her light from the vessel? It breaks the moon’s spell, and frees the body from her. The heartless corpse already made a copy–”

“I won't have to do that,” I said through gritted teeth. “I’m not going to change my mind.”

“If you do, though,” my brother continued, “It has to be the *original* body. The one that is marked and is carved of its heart.”

“Jonas, stop.”

He ducked his head, hiding his face. “I'm just telling you what Mom told me.”

I snapped, jumping to my feet. He thought he was so fucking smart, with knowledge of a psychopathic cult. 

He thought he was better than me because he could speak the moon language perfectly. I hated that he was still thinking logically, with empathy. 

I envied his ability to still *feel*. 

I didn't care. In my mind, they were dead people walking. 

“I don't fucking care,” I spat. “I don't care *how* to undo it, or *how* to break the spell. They're going to become a statistic, just another number in Mom’s failures because the moon clearly fucking hates us, and we’re going to get out of here. So, stop with the, “Maybe you'll change your mind”? Bullshit. I'm killing them to escape. I'm killing them to get us away from Mom.”

I shook my brother, gripping his chin and forcing him to look at me. 

Jonas did look at me, his eyes were frightened.

I'm Unluckyfriedkitten, a 44yr old bloke from the UK. I was diagnosed with Diverticulitis in August of last year after a CT scan and endoscopy/colonoscopy. (that one ranks pretty high on my list of undignified, shitty days)

  
My GP has been, shall we say, less than helpful. I saw him after the procedures where he confirmed what the \*film crew\* at the hospital had already told me and when I asked what I am supposed to be doing, he replied with ""It's just something you have to live with""....cool, thanks doc 👍.



I started researching online after the stellar advice my GP gave me (what foods to avoid etc) but have found a lot of conflicting information about it (some say max out on fibre, others say to avoid it like the plague)  My diet thus far has consisted mainly of \*boiled to death\* cabbage/sprouts/broccoli, chicken+rice and veggie sausages. (god I miss burgers/steak/proper bangers...all red meats!) Had a quick look at the wiki here and will be taking a deeper dive after this post as it looks super helpful.

  
One thing I wasn't prepared for was the intensely painful episodes I've been having, it feels like my stomach is trying to eat itself, some last 20mins, have had one last nearly 2.5hrs. Had one at 16:05 this afternoon after 2 sips of latte (this better not be a trigger as I've just bought a bloody expensive coffee machine!) it finished at 17:00. My coping mechanism for these unruly tummy outbursts is usually curling up in the foetal position on the sofa while loudly groaning and the occasional swearword coupled with sporadic praying to whatever deity will listen but recently found breathing like I'm in labour helps somewhat.

  
Oh and the gas, my god the gas! I'd like to take this opportunity to apologise to and thank my wife for putting up with my constant trumpeting!



I apologise for the lengthy moan, not really sure where I'm going with it to be honest? It feels quite cathartic to put it into words. Any pointers/advice from the seasoned pro's among you would be greatly appreciated and please feel free to share/vent/rant about your own experiences.

1i2xgin,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1i2xgin/hello_again/,Hello again. ,"I've been seeing a new therapist and he has been great. Making progress in talking through anything and everything. Understanding that everything takes time and knowing that all that happened does not define my worth, and I should not allow it to make me feel less.

After talking about the serious stuff that didn't involve us, I was asked what I would do if you were in front of me one last time for a brief moment. I thought about many things I would do. Either lunge towards you, hold you, and ask you how you've been as tears begin to stream down my face, begging you to stay. Or I would reach out to you as if nothing has changed, just so we can feel us as we once were. No urgency, no panic. Just gentle hugs and soft smiles while breathing each other in. To look into your eyes again, I'd feel whole one more time.

And trying to convince myself that these feelings weren't real is me disassociating to feel safe, but it was all real. Every good morning and good night text. Every random ""just thinking about you"" messages. Every conversation and video call. Every snap sent. Every inside joke. The open and honest communication. The coffee we shared. Our lips pressed together. Being skin to skin, hand in hand. It all happened and at one point you were all mine and I was all yours. I do miss that. And I do miss you. I know I will always have a soft spot in my heart for you and the love and care I have for you will always be there.

But like the world turns, the days change, and so do people. I cannot hold onto something or someone that did not want to stay. We cannot change people, but we can still support and love them from afar, watch them grow and thrive. But if there is ever a moment where you need someone and no one is available, I would answer in a heartbeat. I will show up for you because I never learned how to love and care in small amounts. I will always be there for you, and that is my truth.

Through all my rash decisions and going back and forth with the idea of being in each other's lives, I came to the realization that I can't be anything other than myself. And that is to be there for the people in my life that I care for, wholeheartedly. Eventually it'll hurt less and eventually it won't hurt at all. My healing isn't about dropping everything when it gets hard and walking away, it's about fighting through it and creating boundaries for myself. Starting to love myself more while being there for those I care for.

I know this now. 

Unfortunately the constant feeling of exhaustion and numbness became to overwhelming and I tried taking the easy way out. But just like how forward and stubborn I can be, my body didn't want to quit. No matter how much I felt like the world turned its back on me as I got hit over and over, there is always a light, no matter how small. The worst is over and I have to continue to show strength and resilience in order to be truly happy again. In order to feel at peace again. To continue to choose the people I want to keep in my corner and who are willing to stay no matter how hard it gets, and for me to continuously be there for them in return. I feel as if you were placed into my path for a reason. I can't stop my mind from thinking of you, no matter how much I've tried. No matter how much I try to distance myself, I still find myself back here. 

I don't know if you still think about me from time to time or if my voice drifts into your mind like yours does from time to time. Feeling the slight sense of warmth from a shared memory. It happens from time to time for me, I'm not going to lie. I don't know if you truly want a friendship, but I genuinely would like to rebuild and start anew. No more take backs.

I don't have an answer, sorry!","One of my aunts was visiting us the other day and we got onto the topic of collecting. She doesn't collect anything and finds it odd that people hold onto things they don't need. She said, ""Why do you collect dolls? Don't you know it's a little odd? Are you trying to be 7 forever? Are you going to become a hoarder?"" Nobody else was in the room with us when she asked me these things, so she fired off all of these questions while our other family members were setting out snacks in the kitchen. I realized that even though I told her that I'm not planning on becoming a hoarder and I'm not trying to act like a 7-year-old, I don't actually have an answer for her as to why I collect anything, period. 

I enjoy looking at my doll collection, and I like dressing them up, but I don't actually know *why* I feel the need to have a collection of anything, as small as it may be. This annoyed her immensely, and she looked like she wanted to take my shoulders and shake me. I told her that I'm sorry that she's upset, but that I can't give her whatever answer she's looking for. She's the only person I've ever met who has a problem with me collecting dolls. The harder I tried to think about why I feel drawn to dolls instead of paintings, vases, coins, jewelry, stamps, or any other ""normal"" items that people collect, the less I feel like I can give anyone an answer, let alone to my aunt. I like that dolls resemble people and that they come in many different forms and styles, but I absolutely cannot understand why I like dolls, but not other items. In another world, it could've been Hot Wheels, LEGO, art sculptures, watches, postcards, coffee cups, or sneakers, but in this one, it's dolls.

Does anyone else struggle to articulate why they like dolls to other people?",9,1737056671.0,Barbie,4,1.0,False

1i2xe10,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1i2xe10/just_the_flu/,JUST THE FLU,"I put on my running shoes with springs, designed to cushion the impact on the ground. It was my nightly ritual, something I did every single day without fail: running to the neighboring town, keeping my body busy and my mind free of thoughts. It was almost five o’clock, and the sun still stubbornly lingered in the sky, painting everything with a pale golden light.

I opened the door and was greeted by a strange smell. A mix of dampness and decay floated in the air, coming from somewhere behind me. The rotting stench made me wrinkle my nose, but I ignored it. I needed to run. I started climbing the hill, the wind against my face. I passed the entrance to the interstate highway, maintaining a steady pace. I was running at about 4 km/h, a moderate speed to warm up. I crossed the rusty sign that read “No Passing” and smirked bitterly.“Who’s going to pass you now?” I murmured to myself, my voice lost in the emptiness of the road. I kept running along the highway, the sound of my shoes hitting the wet asphalt echoing in the silence. When I approached the old brothel, a shiver ran down my spine. The place had been creepy at its best, but now… The sign that once announced the brothel’s name—something vulgar and flashy—lay fallen beside the building, which now resembled a charred carcass. The letters were faded, the wood that had supported the structure blackened and twisted like burned bones, and the windows were nothing but dark, empty holes that seemed to watch me as I passed.

The brothel was near a lake that used to reflect the vibrant, colorful lights of the facade on festive nights. Now, the water was dark, with an oily sheen under the faint light remaining from the day. The shore was littered with debris—broken bottles, pieces of wood that seemed to be parts of the building, and something that looked like a piece of red fabric.

A horrible smell emanated from the area, thicker than the stench of death I had encountered earlier. It was like a mix of rot and burning, as if decay itself had permeated the air. I looked at the entrance and saw that the old double doors, which used to spin open to welcome customers, were fallen, lying wide open on the ground. Inside, everything was in ruins: overturned tables, broken chairs, and what appeared to be dark stains on the floor and walls. Climbing the next hill, I spotted the reservoir of an abandoned property. The silence there was oppressive, broken only by the distant sound of thunder. The old farmhouse loomed like a ghostly shadow in the landscape. The main house was partially collapsed, with loose planks creaking in the wind, and the windows, which had once reflected life within, were now empty, like soulless eye sockets.

As I got closer, the smell of death grew stronger. In the yard, a man lay near the porch, his face covered in dried blood, flies buzzing around him. His glazed-over eyes seemed fixed on a point in the horizon that no longer existed. The ground around him was marked by erratic footprints and dark stains, as if someone had fought to survive there. Some children’s toys were still scattered across the dead lawn, creating a disturbing contrast to the scene of destruction. The trees around swayed in the wind, their branches like thin arms pointing toward the now cloud-covered sky.

In the stable, a few dead animals lay sprawled. The cow, still with blood on its muzzle, seemed to have collapsed recently. The horses lay beside it, their swollen bodies exuding that now all-too-familiar stench of decay. However, amidst this scene of horror, one pig was still alive, wandering among the corpses with hesitant steps, as if searching for a reason to be there. A few chickens pecked at the ground indifferently, their feathers stained with mud and blood. I passed through the fallen fence. Over the next hill, I spotted the reservoir of a place that seemed to have been abandoned long ago. The farmhouse appeared in the distance, shrouded in an ominous gloom. The trees around it, twisted by the wind, cast unsettling shadows over the waterlogged ground. As I got closer, the smell of blood mixed with decay hit my nose like a punch, making the air almost unbreathable.

In the yard of the house, a man lay sprawled, his face marked with dark patches of dried blood. His lifeless eyes stared up at the sky, as if searching for an answer that never came. The wooden porch creaked in the wind, and the door hung from its last nails, swaying slowly like a clock marking the end of time.

I moved forward and passed a truck stuck in the mud. The engine was off, and the vehicle looked as though it had been swallowed by the earth. Inside the cab, a man was slumped over the steering wheel, motionless. The putrid stench emanating from it was suffocating, but I no longer afforded myself the luxury of being bothered. I ran further, my footsteps echoing on the straight road leading me to the next town.

As I passed by a motel, it stood empty. The neon sign, which had likely once flickered incessantly, was dark and covered in soot. On the ground, bodies were scattered: prostitutes lying awkwardly, as if felled by an invisible force. The abandoned cars around the area told another story—a desperate escape, cut short before reaching its destination. The vehicles now came from the opposite direction, as if everyone was fleeing the city I had just left behind. The stench of decay permeated the air, a smell I was beginning to accept as part of my new reality. The sky grew darker, illuminated only by distant lightning. The stars, now almost fully visible, shone over the dead city. There were no more electric lights, no signs of life. A flash of lightning revealed the body of a small child, no older than five, lying next to her mother. They were holding each other, as if trying to protect one another until the very last moment.

Just one month. A single month, and everything was gone. There weren’t many people left now—perhaps no one but me. I thought about it as memories flooded my mind. I remembered school, before everything shut down for good. I thought of my girlfriend, my friends. All dead. Their families, too. Why am I still alive? That question echoes in my head every day. Why me? Why didn’t I die along with them? Along with everyone else? The Red Plague took everything but left me here, alone, wandering through this open-air cemetery.

As I run down this deserted road, my mind keeps revisiting the past, as if to torture me. I remember what the world was like before it all collapsed. Streets full of people, smiles, laughter. I remember going to school, complaining about classes, but secretly enjoying the routine, my friends, the small things that made me feel alive. My girlfriend… I remember her. I remember what it felt like to hold her hand, hear her laugh, feel the warmth of her embrace. Now, all that’s left of her is a memory that cuts like a knife buried deep in my chest.

My friends… Matheus, the one I used to joke around with, watch people at the mall, crack dumb jokes. We laughed like the world could never end. My mother. She died in my arms on the 22nd. That day is etched into me like a scar that will never fade. I held her as she drowned in her own blood, swollen, her eyes red and blind, unable to see me one last time. She tried to say something, but the words got stuck. And then she was gone. I can’t shake the feeling of her body growing cold in my arms.

I remember how happy we were with so little. I remember afternoons at the mall, eating McDonald’s and people-watching, everyone busy with their normal lives. I remember the conversations, the jokes. The sound of children laughing, the music playing in the stores, the smell of coffee and burgers. Now, all of it feels like a distant dream, something that was never real.

I even miss the things I once found annoying. The lines, the traffic jams, the bills. I’d give anything to have a life where those were my biggest concerns again. Now, all I have is silence. A silence broken only by the sound of my own footsteps and the wind carrying the stench of death. It’s as if the whole world is frozen, stuck in a single moment. One month. Just one month, and it was all over. The world, which took centuries to build, collapsed in weeks. And I was left here, to watch it all end.

Heavy clouds rolled above me, dense and full of rain, occasionally lit by lightning streaking across the horizon. The smell of wet earth began to mix with the stench of decomposition, creating a suffocating sensation. The wind howled around me, cold and damp, as if trying to push me away from this place.

Thunder rumbled in the distance, drawing closer, like the footsteps of an invisible giant. When the first drop fell on my face, it was almost a relief, a reminder that the world still had something alive, something not consumed by the plague. The rain came suddenly, strong and relentless, drenching everything within seconds. The lightning illuminated the field around me, revealing a landscape that seemed ripped straight from a nightmare. Bodies were scattered everywhere, lying in random positions, as if the world had frozen at the moment of its greatest tragedy. Some were still in abandoned cars, others sprawled on the ground where death had caught up to them. Water ran over the corpses, washing away dust and blood, but it couldn’t erase the smell. That smell… No matter how much time passed, I knew I’d never forget it.

I kept running, feeling the heavy rain pounding against my clothes and skin, while my thoughts drifted back to things that now seemed impossible. I’d give anything to be home, on a normal day, eating a poorly made burger from some random diner, accompanied by greasy fries. Ice cream… How I miss ice cream. That feeling of cold sweetness melting on your tongue, dripping slowly as you try to savor every second. I’d give anything for ice cream right now. Or even something simpler: a glass of clean, drinkable water straight from the tap. Water that didn’t taste like rust or death.

I wondered what it would be like to sit in my room, playing video games, with the soft glow of the screen lighting up the space. And the internet… I remember how annoyed I used to get when it went out for a few seconds. Now, I’d trade my life to hear that annoying sound of a notification ping on my phone, any sign that the world still existed outside my head.

Electricity was another thing I’d taken for granted. Just turning on a light when entering a room, opening the fridge to find fresh food, or turning on the TV to watch something stupid. All of that had seemed so small before, but now it was an unattainable luxury.

The rain kept falling, heavier and heavier, as I looked up at the sky. Lightning flashed again, and more bodies appeared on the horizon. Children, mothers, men—people who once had dreams and worries just like me. Now they were there, motionless, as if they’d become part of the landscape. Why am I still here?” I asked myself as the water streamed down my face, mixing with the tears I no longer tried to hold back. They called it INF-1, the Beijing Flu, but I like to call it the end of the world. I don’t know exactly how it started. In Germany, it felt like we were safe at first. “The virus is far away,” the newspapers said. “We’re taking all the necessary measures.” Frankfurt Airport. A couple coming from Asia—nothing the government couldn’t control. That’s what they said.

Within days, hospitals began to overflow. It was like an invisible storm sweeping through entire cities. Berlin fell first, like a tree rotted from the roots. Suddenly, the streets were empty, except for ambulance sirens and muffled screams from behind windows. No one wanted to leave their homes, but it didn’t matter. INF-1 didn’t need you to be close to others. It found you anyway.

Bavaria, where I am now, was no different. The flu came like a shadow, silent at first, then brutal. Stores emptied. Schools closed. Train stations became packed with people trying to escape—to where, no one knew. I saw entire families crammed into train cars, coughing, unaware they were carrying death with them.

The virus was relentless. Symptoms started like an ordinary cold: a mild fever, a cough you’d ignore any other time. But within hours, people began drowning in their own blood. I saw my mother die like that. In my arms. Her face swollen, her eyes red, blind, as if her own body had turned against her.

Doctors disappeared first. Some died trying to save others, others simply vanished—maybe fleeing. I don’t blame them. Who could stand against this?

Germany had disaster plans, of course. We always did. Protocols for everything, from terrorist attacks to pandemics. But INF-1 laughed in the face of all of them. There was no way to track something spreading so quickly. No way to stop something that killed before you even knew you were infected. I remember the last time I watched the news. The anchor was a shadow of her former self, coughing between sentences as she read the numbers. “Seventeen million dead in Europe. The government has declared a national state of emergency.” Then the broadcast cut off. It never came back.

Now, Germany is nothing but a corpse. An entire country turned into an open-air graveyard. The cities that once pulsed with life are deserted, filled only with abandoned cars and bodies slumped in the back seats. Houses that once felt like fortresses are now empty, except for signs of struggle—overturned furniture, bloodstains on the walls, locked doors that no one will ever open again.

The smell… That’s the worst. You never get used to it. Decomposition has taken over everything. The air is heavy, as if the very environment is dying alongside the people. I wonder if it’ll ever go away. Maybe not. Maybe that’s INF-1’s final legacy.

I think about who we were before all this. Wealthy people driving luxury cars, living in expensive apartments, making plans for the future. Now, we’re all the same. It doesn’t matter if you were a banker, a teacher, or someone like me. INF-1 didn’t discriminate. It just took. Frankfurt, Munich, Hamburg, Berlin. All wiped out. Just the flu. It didn’t need a war. It didn’t need bombs or tanks. All it took was a virus.

I wonder if anyone else survived somewhere. If there are others like me, trying to make sense of why we’re still here. I used to ask myself every day: why didn’t I die with the others? Why didn’t I catch the Red Flu? Why was I the only one who made it through? But you know what? Screw it. The answer doesn’t change anything. I walked to a dusty shelf in a local market and found a forgotten chocolate bar. It was slightly squished, the wrapper worn, but it was still chocolate. I picked it up, unwrapped it slowly, and took a bite, tasting the sweetness, though strange, as if my sense of taste wasn’t the same anymore. While rummaging through the market, I saw a man lying next to the ATM. He had died there, his card still in hand. Dried blood pooled around him, and the air was thick with the stench of decaying flesh.

I continued along the straight road, the soles of my shoes echoing on the cracked asphalt. The city appeared on the horizon, like all the others. Dead. Silent. The same scene I had memorized by now. As I got closer, I saw the city sign at the entrance, charred, the remnants of the name burned and unrecognizable. The metal was twisted, as if it had passed through hell.

On the streets, thousands of abandoned cars clogged the roads, blocking any chance of passage. Many drivers were still inside, dead, their bodies strapped in by seatbelts. Some had their heads slumped against the steering wheels; others had their eyes open, frozen. I kept walking, the stench of death hanging in the air around me. I passed over a speed bump and saw an old woman lying next to it. Her white hair was tangled, and her skin, dry and pale, seemed almost fused with the concrete. Further ahead, a man lay on the sidewalk, his fingers still outstretched toward his house’s door. Maybe he had tried to go back for something. Maybe he thought he’d be safe inside. It didn’t matter.

The world didn’t end with explosions or anything grand. There wasn’t a meteor tearing across the sky or volcanoes spewing fire. It wasn’t a nuclear war reducing everything to ashes, or electromagnetic pulses wiping out technology. It was just a flu. A flu no one could stop. INF-1, the Red Flu, silent and deadly, erased centuries of civilization in mere weeks.

I looked at the city again—its empty streets, silent homes, stores left open with looted shelves. The world collapsed because of something so small we couldn’t even see it. Just the flu. That was enough to destroy everything we had built.

Thunder rumbled in the distance, announcing the approaching rain, and the wind turned colder. A flash of lightning illuminated the street ahead, revealing more bodies. I saw a small child lying next to a bicycle, a school backpack spilled open behind them. A few steps farther, there was another body—what looked like the child’s mother, arms outstretched, trying to shield her until the very last moment.

Has this happened before? Did another civilization, at some point, fall to something this simple? Thick raindrops began to fall hard, bursting against the asphalt, forming puddles that seemed like distorted mirrors of the sky. The wind howled, sharp and biting, and the thunder punched through the air, making the ground tremble beneath my feet. The city was dead, but it felt like nature itself wanted to remind me there was still power in the world, even if only to destroy what was left. I ran. My steps splashed water in every direction as I searched for any place to take shelter. The cold cut through my skin, and the heavy rain-soaked clothes clung to my body, making every movement harder. I looked around, but everything seemed empty, desolate. Silent buildings, broken windows, abandoned cars forming a useless labyrinth. With each flash of lightning, the scene lit up for a second, revealing details I wished I couldn’t see: corpses scattered in the streets, some half-submerged in puddles, others lying in impossible positions, like ragdolls.

Finally, I spotted a small house with open windows and a door slightly ajar. I ran toward it, ignoring the smell coming from inside. I already knew what I’d find, but I had no choice. I stepped in, pushing the creaking door open, and shut it behind me to block out the wind. Inside, the smell was almost suffocating: mold, decay, and something sickly sweet I couldn’t identify.

The living room was filled with dusty furniture, papers scattered on the floor, and dark stains on the walls. On the couch, a couple sat—or what was left of them. Both had swollen faces and dark patches around their mouths and noses, their hands still clasped together as if they had faced death united. The sight made my stomach twist, but I looked away. I didn’t have the energy to care anymore.

I kept exploring, moving down a narrow hallway. In one of the bedrooms, I found more bodies—children this time. A little girl held a bloodstained teddy bear, and a boy lay beside her, staring blankly at the ceiling. I left quickly. I couldn’t stay in that room another second.

But outside, the rain was an impenetrable wall. Lightning illuminated the broken windows, and the thunder was so loud it felt like it shook the house’s walls. I sat on the kitchen floor, leaning against an old refrigerator, trying to ignore the constant dripping sound from the countless leaks in the ceiling. My stomach growled, and hunger felt like a knife lodged in my body.

I looked around, my eyes adjusting to the dim light. Then, I saw it: the fridge. I crawled to it, my hands trembling from the cold and anxiety. I yanked the door open, and the smell that poured out was almost as bad as the one in the living room—rotten food, spoiled meat, and liquid remnants pooling at the bottom. Even so, I kept searching. Among the empty packages and moldy containers, I found something that felt like a miracle: a can of soup, still sealed.

My fingers gripped the can like it was gold. I checked the expiration date—it was good until next year. I laughed to myself, a dry, strange sound, because who cared about expiration dates now? I took the can and rummaged through the kitchen for something to open it. Finally, I found a rusty can opener.

When I managed to open the can, the smell of the soup wasn’t exactly appetizing, but it was still food. The rain kept pounding outside, but in that moment, with the can of soup in my hands, I felt more human than I had in weeks.

I ate the soup cold, straight from the can. The salty liquid and mushy bits of vegetables filled my empty stomach, and for a moment, the terrible taste didn’t matter. It was warmth in a cold world. It was life in a world of death.

I leaned against the wall, listening as the thunder slowly drifted farther away. Outside, the world was finished, but here, with that empty can by my side, I allowed myself a moment of peace.",0,1737056505.0,shortscarystories,3,0.5,False

That day is etched into me like a scar that will never fade. I held her as she drowned in her own blood, swollen, her eyes red and blind, unable to see me one last time. She tried to say something, but the words got stuck. And then she was gone. I can’t shake the feeling of her body growing cold in my arms.

I remember how happy we were with so little. I remember afternoons at the mall, eating McDonald’s and people-watching, everyone busy with their normal lives. I remember the conversations, the jokes. The sound of children laughing, the music playing in the stores, the smell of coffee and burgers. Now, all of it feels like a distant dream, something that was never real.

I even miss the things I once found annoying. The lines, the traffic jams, the bills. I’d give anything to have a life where those were my biggest concerns again. Now, all I have is silence. A silence broken only by the sound of my own footsteps and the wind carrying the stench of death. It’s as if the whole world is frozen, stuck in a single moment. One month. Just one month, and it was all over. The world, which took centuries to build, collapsed in weeks. And I was left here, to watch it all end.

Heavy clouds rolled above me, dense and full of rain, occasionally lit by lightning streaking across the horizon. The smell of wet earth began to mix with the stench of decomposition, creating a suffocating sensation. The wind howled around me, cold and damp, as if trying to push me away from this place.

Thunder rumbled in the distance, drawing closer, like the footsteps of an invisible giant. When the first drop fell on my face, it was almost a relief, a reminder that the world still had something alive, something not consumed by the plague. The rain came suddenly, strong and relentless, drenching everything within seconds. The lightning illuminated the field around me, revealing a landscape that seemed ripped straight from a nightmare. Bodies were scattered everywhere, lying in random positions, as if the world had frozen at the moment of its greatest tragedy. Some were still in abandoned cars, others sprawled on the ground where death had caught up to them. Water ran over the corpses, washing away dust and blood, but it couldn’t erase the smell. That smell… No matter how much time passed, I knew I’d never forget it.

I kept running, feeling the heavy rain pounding against my clothes and skin, while my thoughts drifted back to things that now seemed impossible. I’d give anything to be home, on a normal day, eating a poorly made burger from some random diner, accompanied by greasy fries. Ice cream… How I miss ice cream. That feeling of cold sweetness melting on your tongue, dripping slowly as you try to savor every second. I’d give anything for ice cream right now. Or even something simpler: a glass of clean, drinkable water straight from the tap. Water that didn’t taste like rust or death.

I wondered what it would be like to sit in my room, playing video games, with the soft glow of the screen lighting up the space. And the internet… I remember how annoyed I used to get when it went out for a few seconds. Now, I’d trade my life to hear that annoying sound of a notification ping on my phone, any sign that the world still existed outside my head.

Electricity was another thing I’d taken for granted. Just turning on a light when entering a room, opening the fridge to find fresh food, or turning on the TV to watch something stupid. All of that had seemed so small before, but now it was an unattainable luxury.

The rain kept falling, heavier and heavier, as I looked up at the sky. Lightning flashed again, and more bodies appeared on the horizon. Children, mothers, men—people who once had dreams and worries just like me. Now they were there, motionless, as if they’d become part of the landscape. Why am I still here?” I asked myself as the water streamed down my face, mixing with the tears I no longer tried to hold back. They called it INF-1, the Beijing Flu, but I like to call it the end of the world. I don’t know exactly how it started. In Germany, it felt like we were safe at first. “The virus is far away,” the newspapers said. “We’re taking all the necessary measures.” Frankfurt Airport. A couple coming from Asia—nothing the government couldn’t control. That’s what they said.

Within days, hospitals began to overflow. It was like an invisible storm sweeping through entire cities. Berlin fell first, like a tree rotted from the roots. Suddenly, the streets were empty, except for ambulance sirens and muffled screams from behind windows. No one wanted to leave their homes, but it didn’t matter. INF-1 didn’t need you to be close to others. It found you anyway.

Bavaria, where I am now, was no different. The flu came like a shadow, silent at first, then brutal. Stores emptied. Schools closed. Train stations became packed with people trying to escape—to where, no one knew. I saw entire families crammed into train cars, coughing, unaware they were carrying death with them.

The virus was relentless. Symptoms started like an ordinary cold: a mild fever, a cough you’d ignore any other time. But within hours, people began drowning in their own blood. I saw my mother die like that. In my arms. Her face swollen, her eyes red, blind, as if her own body had turned against her.

Doctors disappeared first. Some died trying to save others, others simply vanished—maybe fleeing. I don’t blame them. Who could stand against this?

Germany had disaster plans, of course. We always did. Protocols for everything, from terrorist attacks to pandemics. But INF-1 laughed in the face of all of them. There was no way to track something spreading so quickly. No way to stop something that killed before you even knew you were infected. I remember the last time I watched the news. The anchor was a shadow of her former self, coughing between sentences as she read the numbers. “Seventeen million dead in Europe. The government has declared a national state of emergency.” Then the broadcast cut off. It never came back.

Now, Germany is nothing but a corpse. An entire country turned into an open-air graveyard. The cities that once pulsed with life are deserted, filled only with abandoned cars and bodies slumped in the back seats. Houses that once felt like fortresses are now empty, except for signs of struggle—overturned furniture, bloodstains on the walls, locked doors that no one will ever open again.

The smell… That’s the worst. You never get used to it. Decomposition has taken over everything. The air is heavy, as if the very environment is dying alongside the people. I wonder if it’ll ever go away. Maybe not. Maybe that’s INF-1’s final legacy.

I think about who we were before all this. Wealthy people driving luxury cars, living in expensive apartments, making plans for the future. Now, we’re all the same. It doesn’t matter if you were a banker, a teacher, or someone like me. INF-1 didn’t discriminate. It just took. Frankfurt, Munich, Hamburg, Berlin. All wiped out. Just the flu. It didn’t need a war. It didn’t need bombs or tanks. All it took was a virus.

I wonder if anyone else survived somewhere. If there are others like me, trying to make sense of why we’re still here. I used to ask myself every day: why didn’t I die with the others? Why didn’t I catch the Red Flu? Why was I the only one who made it through? But you know what? Screw it. The answer doesn’t change anything. I walked to a dusty shelf in a local market and found a forgotten chocolate bar. It was slightly squished, the wrapper worn, but it was still chocolate. I picked it up, unwrapped it slowly, and took a bite, tasting the sweetness, though strange, as if my sense of taste wasn’t the same anymore. While rummaging through the market, I saw a man lying next to the ATM. He had died there, his card still in hand. Dried blood pooled around him, and the air was thick with the stench of decaying flesh.

I continued along the straight road, the soles of my shoes echoing on the cracked asphalt. The city appeared on the horizon, like all the others. Dead. Silent. The same scene I had memorized by now. As I got closer, I saw the city sign at the entrance, charred, the remnants of the name burned and unrecognizable. The metal was twisted, as if it had passed through hell.

On the streets, thousands of abandoned cars clogged the roads, blocking any chance of passage. Many drivers were still inside, dead, their bodies strapped in by seatbelts. Some had their heads slumped against the steering wheels; others had their eyes open, frozen. I kept walking, the stench of death hanging in the air around me. I passed over a speed bump and saw an old woman lying next to it. Her white hair was tangled, and her skin, dry and pale, seemed almost fused with the concrete. Further ahead, a man lay on the sidewalk, his fingers still outstretched toward his house’s door. Maybe he had tried to go back for something. Maybe he thought he’d be safe inside. It didn’t matter.

The world didn’t end with explosions or anything grand. There wasn’t a meteor tearing across the sky or volcanoes spewing fire. It wasn’t a nuclear war reducing everything to ashes, or electromagnetic pulses wiping out technology. It was just a flu. A flu no one could stop. INF-1, the Red Flu, silent and deadly, erased centuries of civilization in mere weeks.

I looked at the city again—its empty streets, silent homes, stores left open with looted shelves. The world collapsed because of something so small we couldn’t even see it. Just the flu. That was enough to destroy everything we had built.

Thunder rumbled in the distance, announcing the approaching rain, and the wind turned colder. A flash of lightning illuminated the street ahead, revealing more bodies. I saw a small child lying next to a bicycle, a school backpack spilled open behind them. A few steps farther, there was another body—what looked like the child’s mother, arms outstretched, trying to shield her until the very last moment.

Has this happened before? Did another civilization, at some point, fall to something this simple? Thick raindrops began to fall hard, bursting against the asphalt, forming puddles that seemed like distorted mirrors of the sky. The wind howled, sharp and biting, and the thunder punched through the air, making the ground tremble beneath my feet. The city was dead, but it felt like nature itself wanted to remind me there was still power in the world, even if only to destroy what was left. I ran. My steps splashed water in every direction as I searched for any place to take shelter. The cold cut through my skin, and the heavy rain-soaked clothes clung to my body, making every movement harder. I looked around, but everything seemed empty, desolate. Silent buildings, broken windows, abandoned cars forming a useless labyrinth. With each flash of lightning, the scene lit up for a second, revealing details I wished I couldn’t see: corpses scattered in the streets, some half-submerged in puddles, others lying in impossible positions, like ragdolls.

Finally, I spotted a small house with open windows and a door slightly ajar. I ran toward it, ignoring the smell coming from inside. I already knew what I’d find, but I had no choice. I stepped in, pushing the creaking door open, and shut it behind me to block out the wind. Inside, the smell was almost suffocating: mold, decay, and something sickly sweet I couldn’t identify.

The living room was filled with dusty furniture, papers scattered on the floor, and dark stains on the walls. On the couch, a couple sat—or what was left of them. Both had swollen faces and dark patches around their mouths and noses, their hands still clasped together as if they had faced death united. The sight made my stomach twist, but I looked away. I didn’t have the energy to care anymore.

I kept exploring, moving down a narrow hallway. In one of the bedrooms, I found more bodies—children this time. A little girl held a bloodstained teddy bear, and a boy lay beside her, staring blankly at the ceiling. I left quickly. I couldn’t stay in that room another second.

But outside, the rain was an impenetrable wall. Lightning illuminated the broken windows, and the thunder was so loud it felt like it shook the house’s walls. I sat on the kitchen floor, leaning against an old refrigerator, trying to ignore the constant dripping sound from the countless leaks in the ceiling. My stomach growled, and hunger felt like a knife lodged in my body.

I looked around, my eyes adjusting to the dim light. Then, I saw it: the fridge. I crawled to it, my hands trembling from the cold and anxiety. I yanked the door open, and the smell that poured out was almost as bad as the one in the living room—rotten food, spoiled meat, and liquid remnants pooling at the bottom. Even so, I kept searching. Among the empty packages and moldy containers, I found something that felt like a miracle: a can of soup, still sealed.

My fingers gripped the can like it was gold. I checked the expiration date—it was good until next year. I laughed to myself, a dry, strange sound, because who cared about expiration dates now? I took the can and rummaged through the kitchen for something to open it. Finally, I found a rusty can opener.

When I managed to open the can, the smell of the soup wasn’t exactly appetizing, but it was still food. The rain kept pounding outside, but in that moment, with the can of soup in my hands, I felt more human than I had in weeks.

I ate the soup cold, straight from the can. The salty liquid and mushy bits of vegetables filled my empty stomach, and for a moment, the terrible taste didn’t matter. It was warmth in a cold world. It was life in a world of death.

I leaned against the wall, listening as the thunder slowly drifted farther away. Outside, the world was finished, but here, with that empty can by my side, I allowed myself a moment of peace.",0,1737056421.0,creepypasta,0,0.5,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

1i2xbba,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1i2xbba/quitting_caffeine_when_you_completely_rely_on_it/,Quitting caffeine when you completely rely on it - How?,"Hi.

So, I have a bit of an issue with my caffeine consumption. When I first started drinking coffee more regularly (daily) back in 2022, I didn't have many issues with it at the start. At the end of 2022, though, my anxiety worsened immensely and I started having bad sleep. I tend to wake up every few hours now. For context, I also have a diagnosed anxiety disorder and a personality disorder - I saw some posts here recently that said it's all caffeine which I know it isn't for me since I've had anxiety since before.

Now, my main issue that has formed since then is-... I basically cannot function without the caffeine, which is bad for me because I know it can elevate anxiety but also--... I have gastritis now and coffee is -horrible- for that. The problem is, coffee is the only thing that makes me able to think clearly without my mind feeling foggy or wandering constantly. I drink one cup in the morning, either one espresso with a lot of milk or a proper coffee with a little bit of milk. Occasionally I drink a coke or pepsi later on in the day, or more commonly, some iced tea. In the evenings, when the caffeine starts to fade, my mind begins racing very quickly and I can't fight the anxiety nearly as easily as I can on coffee.

Because of that, I am in a bit of a position where I don't know what to do. I feel like both, quitting caffeine and continuing it will not be that great for me. I'd love some advice if anyone has something to share!

Thanks.",1,1737056314.0,decaf,3,1.0,False

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

I need to get this off my chest.,"It is with a very heavy heart that I write this letter.  I really thought we had a life together.  I’ve had some time to really sit down, and think, and do some counseling, and write in a journal, and reflect.  I tried to write this many times and just couldn’t bring myself to do it.  It took a lot longer than you could imagine for me to type this out.  And through many tears and much pain.

I loved you with all my heart, every fiber of my being.  Every day I would think about you and wait patiently for you to text me at work.  It was always the highlight of my day.  And I’d read and respond to your messages immediately.  And although I loved you with everything I had, I can see that I could let workplace or life’s stressors prevent me from showing you how much I truly loved you.  And for that, I’m sorry. 

And you coming home every day made me so happy.  I loved to hear the hallway door slam, and hear the deadbolt turn, and watch the animals jump to attention to greet you at the door.  I loved the little routines – how you’d text me before 8 AM on my way to work, and we’d talk.  How I’d wait for your texts at your lunch break.  How we’d text each other if we went to the grocery store. 

I honestly thought we’d grow old together.  That’s what I truly wanted.  I wanted the daily routine and the texts and the talks and the drives.  I wanted the traditions – sushi and movies in XXXXXX, our restaurants, even sitting on the couch while the animals and I got our turn being subject to ear inspections.  All of this was the life I wanted to build with you.

Look, if I was not attentive to your needs, I’m very sorry. I was willing to work on that.  I still am. I have talked to many people who went to couple’s counseling and came out stronger.  I was willing to set it up, and put in the effort, and go through the pain and the emotion, and hearing my weaknesses, and work through them.  I truly, truly wanted to make this work. I still do.

I’m sure you know, you really hurt me with the silent treatment.  I could handle all sorts of negative feedback from you, as hard as it would be to accept.  Because at least we’d be talking.  But one thing that’s so hard to deal with, is wondering if I will ever hear from you, or see you again.  You hurt me by not going to XXXX’s funeral.  I waited at the back of the church for you for over an hour, thinking you’d make some grand entrance like a movie.  And when I realized you weren’t coming, I quietly joined my family up at the front.  I had tears of sadness for two reasons that day. 

It's a very tough pill to swallow to accept that I may never hear from you, or see you again.  That’s something that I’m going to have to live with, and work on.  The cats help.  XXXXX is obviously very stressed out, so he’s lost weight.  Him and I both.  I suppose the two of us could benefit from a little bit of weight loss.  XXXXX is very affectionate, which is not like him.  It’s hard for me to not see XXXXX either, and have him steal my spot, and hear his tail thumping against the living room wall, and hear his collar jingle, and hear him sneeze when he was happy or excited.

Despite the pain and the heartbreak, I **very much still love you.  If you called me, or texted me, I would respond to you.  If you needed me, I’d be there.  If you wanted to work it out, I’d do as much counseling as need be and put in the work.**  **If you decided you wanted to give us a shot, I’m here.**  **If you wanted to meet to go for coffee or chat or do whatever, I’m always around.**

But I can’t make you love me. I can’t make you want to be with me. I can’t make you come back.  And I’m not going to force you, or beg you, or plead, or make promises.  I know you enough to know this is a conclusion you will have to make on your own.  I am willing to make it work.  If you are not willing to make it work, it won’t.  That’s a tough pill to swallow for me, believe me.

You value your independence, as do I.  I was always happy when you went to the barn, because I know that being there made you happy.  Your voice would get high and happy when you talked about the goats, or the cats, or Freya.  Over the years, the times when you didn’t have a horse, you didn’t seem complete.  You seemed happier when you had a horse.  And I wanted to do whatever I could to make that a reality.  You were ecstatic when you bought Freya.  If I asked you when you were coming back from the barn, it’s because I often waited home for your return so we could spend time together. 

How can you sum up 15 years of feelings? Not very easily.  I just hope you read this.  I am working on myself.  I can’t make you love or want me or want to even talk or text with me.  I will have to learn to accept that you will have moved on, and don’t want a life with me.  But I say this again – if you ever want to call me to talk, or text, or just have a conversation, I’m always here for you.

At the moment, I'm working remote (sales) and I'm pretty good at it, i do it from the comfort of my dark room, and since the day i started working i developed my own methods and used the script only for the rules. Everyone else in the firm started copying my methods and they became more effective. I see that as an achievement, also the job pays me really well. I'm an intense person, always working on some side projects, i love learning and experimenting. I usually read books in my free time, grab a coffee or play some chess. I love rock, alt-rock, metal/heavy metal and listening to these genres kind of calms me.

My 7 month old boy kid got second degree burns coz of hot coffee spilling over him. 

We had kept the hot drink at the edge of table over a plate and i moved aside for few seconds. He was quick enough to crawl and spill the coffee over him and further he had crawled over the drink which made his skin burn in chest, shoulder areas and also near palm in one of the hands. 


He was crying for almost entire day from the time we admitted him in hospital. 

They did a collagen dressing and doctors said his pain should subside in 2-3 days and full recovery would take 12-14 days. 

Will this leave any permanent scars on his body?and when is the earliest he can get back to normal and start playing. 
Will his skin grow back like before ?

Diabetes is becoming a major health issue in Algeria, even amongst teenagers and young adults. Yet it doesn’t seem to be getting the attention it deserves. The numbers are rising, and when you look at our lifestyle, it’s not surprising why.

A typical Algerian breakfast is almost pure carbs, mille feuille, bread, msemen, baghrir, croissants, all paired with sweetened coffee or milk. This kind of diet spikes blood sugar levels and, over time, contributes to insulin resistance. To make matters worse, physical activity isn’t a priority for many people. Life has become more sedentary, and regular exercise is often neglected.

Every morning when I'm having my pre-work coffee, i see people stuffing their faces with cake, mille feuille and other pastries along with a full bottle of that cheap disgusting milky juice, followed by a coffee with 5 or 6 teaspoons of sugar. And let's not even talk about our eating habits in Ramadan... it's terrifying. 

Another overlooked factor is stress. The average Algerian is known for having a short temper and high stress levels. But what many don’t realize is that chronic stress directly impacts blood sugar levels. Stress hormones like cortisol cause spikes in glucose, and when combined with poor eating habits and lack of exercise, it creates the perfect storm for diabetes. Yet, education about stress management is almost nonexistent.

If we don’t start addressing these issues, through better awareness, healthier eating habits, and a stronger culture of exercise, diabetes will continue to take a heavy toll on public health. What do you think needs to change? Have you noticed the impact of diabetes in your own circle?

We would hang out when our schedules allowed and I would have very much called her my best friend. 

Since T had fairly recently gone through her divorce she was not looking for a new person, she was enjoying her kids and just having fun with friends.
I was looking.
In April 2024, I had been on Christian dating sites and found a guy who I liked and he had recently started attending church. (We’ll call him J, 40)

J had integrated pretty seamlessly into my friend group. He had attended game nights and dinners and even a weekend event at T’s house with about a dozen of our friends.
J and I were okay but not great. I wanted to move more slowly in our relationship and he did not. There were small disagreements like who would visit whom since we lived a couple hours away from each other. For the most part I didn’t have an issue being the one who drove every weekend but over time it took its toll.
Over the 4th of July we had a fight and I left. We didn’t talk much for about a week and in the end we realized we could be friends but we were straight crap as a couple. It ended amicably at the beginning of Aug.

The next weekend, J and T had each offered to help our friend R do a final clean out of her apt after her move and the three of them hung out at R’s pool and then went to a singles event at R’s church. (I found out later they pretty much were sucking face every time R turned her back)

I got a message from J that Sunday asking my permission to ask T on a date. I said “Sure okay.” Thinking it was so cute that he would ask to date my friend. We were all friends and I was kind of curious and excited to watch this unfold.

For the next month I was very busy with classes and work and I hadn’t been able to check in with T to see how things were going with J. 

I didn’t have to. We got a very cryptic post Saturday morning mid September, in our friends group on Marco Polo. Them together, and her flashing a ring.

I was FLOORED!! 
Our group chat was awash with congrats.

I was at work and I just started sobbing. My boss came back from getting coffee and she immediately asked who needed to be hurt.
I half laughed and told her what happened. She kind of hugged me (she’s not really a hugger but she tries) and she said they did need hurt. Period. 
She told me to go get cleaned up a bit and breathe. We worked. I got PM notifications from other friends in the group. I tried to ignore things. I answered a couple at lunch. They asked how I was doing and I told them I was not okay. This was so fast. They too said they had whiplash from it.

J & T never officially set a date but there were rumors that it was going to be at the end of October. As much as I didn’t want to know and see it all unfold. It felt like the train crash you couldn’t look away from.

5 weeks later they were married at her house in the backyard. No one from the friend group had been invited. We found out when things were posted in Polo and when my FB was flooded with pictures and notifications. I had to turn off all notifications and hide all their posts to hold my feelings together. 

In case you’re keeping track that’s 10 weeks from J asking me to date T to them getting married.

My work took me out of town at that time so when I got back everyone around me was asking how I was doing and did I know T&Jq had gotten married?

I was crushed. I called my therapist. I was so conflicted about the whole thing. I didn’t know if it was wrong to be hurt for me and kind of happy for them but over all the whole situation felt underhanded. 
BTW they both had been radio silent with me directly since the engagement announcement but they would occasionally post in the group chat.

I would see them at church and wasn’t sure how to act. T would call and want to talk and sometimes she wanted to talk about J. J would send memes or stop me at church to see how I was doing as if nothing had changed between us.

After talking to a friend who is outside of this whole thing. I send a message to them both saying I would like some space. J didn’t reply but T said “I figured that was the case.”

They have organized another weekend trip at their house for next year and I’m being told repeatedly that I need to come. 
It’s been scheduled for the weekend of my birthday. (They know it’s over my birthday)
A couple friends from out of town were talking about celebrating J & T since no one got to come to the wedding. When it was brought up that it’s also my birthday it was suggested that we have one big party celebrating it all.

Secondly, maybe my sniffer is defective .
Third, I grew up on a farm with animals, so make of that what you will.

After reading others' *passionate* opinions on this controversial fragrance, I've been eager to give Hyrax a try. People have commented on their experiences with sentiments like ""unwearable"", ""straight feces"", ""horrible"", ""no!"".
While I can sort of see how the animalic notes in Hyrax (primarly in the opening) could evoke averse reactions for an unprepared nose, *AND* knowing drydown will differ slightly from person to person, I don't understand the hatred for this olfactory art piece. 

I absolutely love this dynamic fragrance. My experience with a spray of Hyrax is as follows.

You're laying out on a desert rock with your arm beneath your head as a pillow, your face just inches from the stone beneath you. The sun has just emerged from the next peak, illuminating and instantly heating the rocks, releasing a warm, minerally, dry smell. Almost the opposite of petrichor? The wind tosses slight whiffs of every so often from an animal den- fur and a smell that *could be* pee or could be be aromatic herbs- think desert parsley, slightly medicinal but floral. The questionable ""could be pee"" smell fades out completely (on me). With the drydown it's like the breeze changes direction completely, filling the air with sweet florals and ponderosa pine bark (vanilla and bark) over the earthy sun-baked rocks. It's dry and warm, but comfortable. Just a couple meters away, Hyraxes emerge, stretch out on the rocks in front of their den to soak it in. As the fragrance wears on, any sharp notes fade and you're left with a soft, warm, cozy fragrance that lasts an entire day. 

The settings in which I would wear Hyrax (and plan to!) are similar to the same ones in which I wear Moth. To me, if Moth is from above, airy and floating, Hyrax is from the below, grounded, warm, mysterious. 
Book stores, leather and wood adorned coffee shops, evening lounges, cocktail bars, vintage markets, the woods, outside anywhere on a fall or winter day. I want to wear velvet, fur, wool and light ethereal fabrics with Hyrax. I would not wear this to yoga or on a hot summer day. 

It's masculine, it's feminine, it's perfectly, subtely sweet. 
Hyrax is warm and dark, like the coziest, safest little den. 10/10",12,1737055690.0,fragrance,5,0.93,False

We were very close until years ago, when I decided to distance myself because she was taking advantage of me. She wouldn't reciprocate my favors, and used tricks to get me to pay for her food, like “forgetting “ her wallet or claiming to be flat broke while not telling me that she found a new job.  It wasn't just me. She lost another 2 long friendships during a road trip for the same reason.

I have built a solid life for myself. My kids are healthy, I drive a good car and have a nice home. She and I accidentally ran into each other, and she started texting again. We did have phone calls and met for coffee, and she seemed to have changed a lot. I was even glad to see her. This new stage in our friendship lasted for 3 years, no incidents.

Last December, I let her stay over because she was waiting for her new place to be available. We agreed it would be for only 4 days. Then she started moving the date. I started getting both pissed and worried because after another 5 days, she began to refuse to get up when I approached her. I would go to work and she stayed in bed. She developed a habit of curling up and clicking her tongue to show me that she was super sleepy, but it felt intentional. It happened every time that I tried to wake her up. There was an incident in which I went to her guest bed and she called me a *itch. I know she was half asleep, but as a friend, I was put off. She did things that frankly enraged me, like taking too long to be fully awake and stretching her arms like she was super sleepy. In the meantime, I had to tend to her kids. I had a talk with her and she admitted that she didn't get Xmas presents for  them. I bought some presents because despite the circumstances, they are just kids and it's not their fault. She promised to leave by the 23rd, and she didn't. It may not sound like a big deal, but I was seething because I had to do all the gift openings with my kids while she was still there, and Ifelt invaded. Every time that I brought up the subject of her new place, she acted grouchy and closed off. I asked her to leave, and she said yes, but I never saw anything happening.

I had my plumber come over early in the morning and turn off the breakers and the main water passage. Her kids woke her up to complain about not being able to plug their electronics. She complained, but I told her to pack her bags because I would be going out of town and would solve the utilities “when” I could. I made her load her bags into her car, and once she was gone, I fixed the utilities back. I didn't hear from her, so I stopped feeling paranoid and thinking that she would try to drop by. 

I got a DM from one of her friends days ago. That person is in my contacts because we were friendly and used to comment on Alicia's wall posts. The message was unpleasant and harsh. I was called insensitive and a snob and was told that Alicia was forced to move to a place without any furniture because I decided to kick her out despite having a lot of space. I know my reply was rude ( I said “go wash your ass”) and they blocked me. I also blocked Alicia, but I can't deny that I feel bad. AITA?

1i2wyrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i2wyrd/the_last_one_for_the_road/,THE LAST ONE FOR THE ROAD,"— Give me one last drink. — The hoarse voice cut through the silence of the nearly empty bar, heavy with impatience.

The bartender, Pituca, glanced up as he wiped a glass with an already grimy rag. He cast a wary look at the man seated at the counter.  
— You shouldn’t be drinking, you know? — Pituca said, his tone hesitant but firm.

The man raised an eyebrow, almost mocking the advice.  
— One shot won’t hurt, Pituca. — He leaned slightly forward, resting his elbow on the counter. — Just to warm up before I hit the road.

Pituca sighed but didn’t move.  
— I don’t know about this... — he murmured, glancing sideways at the glass in his hand. — A lot of folks are crashing on those highways... Especially on the BRs.

— A bunch of cowards! — the man shot back with a wry smirk. — I’ve been doing this for years, Pituca. I know what I’m doing. Pour me that last drink. I’ve got a delivery to make tonight.

— Delivery? — Pituca asked, suspicious, as he set the glass down on the counter.

— Yeah. Heading to Vale Verde.

At the mention of that place, Pituca went pale. He froze, the rag suspended mid-air, his face ghostly white. He said nothing. Turning reluctantly, he began preparing the drink.

Meanwhile, the man glanced around. The bar was nearly empty, the yellowish light casting strange shadows on the walls. Outside, the sound of a cricket seemed to grow louder by the second, as if warning of something.

Pituca placed the glass on the counter, his hand trembling slightly.  
— Good luck. — His voice was almost a whisper.

The man shrugged, grabbed the glass, and downed it in one gulp. Rising from his seat, he noticed Pituca’s unnerved expression.  
— Pituca, you okay? — I asked, staring at the old bartender. He seemed uneasy, his face paler than usual, his eyes fixed on some invisible point on the counter.

He took a few seconds to respond, and when he finally raised his eyes, his expression was grave.  
— If I were you, Jhonatan... I wouldn’t go there.

— Wouldn’t go where? — I asked, raising an eyebrow. The unexpected reply piqued my curiosity.

— To Vale Verde. — His tone was low, almost a whisper, as if he didn’t want anyone else to hear, even though the bar was empty except for the two of us.

I laughed, trying to lighten the mood.  
— Ah, Pituca... What’s this about? Since when do you believe in that nonsense? You’re starting to sound like my mom with those scary bedtime stories.

Pituca didn’t smile. He just shook his head slowly and pressed his lips together. Worry seemed etched into every line of his aged face.  
— I’ve heard stories about that place since I was a kid, Jhonatan. — He sighed, crossing his arms on the counter. — That place is bad. Real bad.

— Bad how, Pituca? Come on, you’re kidding.

He leaned in closer, his voice now laden with unsettling seriousness.  
— People disappear there, Jhonatan. No explanation, no trace. They just vanish. Especially kids.

The last phrase stopped my laughter before it even started.  
— Kids? — I asked, now paying attention.

— Yeah. They get lost in the rows of cornfields and are never seen again. — He gestured outside, as if he could visualize the place he was describing. — And there’s no point in searching. They never find anything. Just emptiness... And a strange silence.

— Alright, alright. — I raised my hands, still half-smiling. — Just because someone got lost in the fields doesn’t mean the place is cursed, right?

Pituca was silent for a moment, his gaze fixed on me.  
— A kid showed up here the other day. Must’ve been about 18, full of bravado. He came with his girlfriend.

I leaned in, intrigued.  
— And?

He sighed before continuing.  
— Said he was going to Vale Verde. I tried to warn him. Told him everything I could. But he just laughed in my face.

— What did he say? — I asked, curious.

Pituca closed his eyes for a moment, as if trying to push away the unsettling memory.  
— He looked at me and said, “I’m taking my girl to the Vale Verde cornfield. It’s gonna be the best night of my life. You’ll see, you old coward.”

I laughed briefly, but the sound came out nervous.  
— Bold kid. Teenagers always think they know everything, huh?

Pituca didn’t find it funny.  
— Yeah, I thought the same thing at the time. But a few days later, his parents showed up here. The girl’s mother too.

— Looking for them? — I asked, my tone now more serious.

He nodded.  
— They came in desperation, asking if I knew anything. I told them what I knew—that they’d gone to Vale Verde.

— And then?

Pituca shook his head slowly.  
— Never heard from them again. Not the parents. Not the girl’s mother. No one.

The silence that fell over the bar was uncomfortable, like a weight settling over the room. Outside, the wind howled softly, pushing the door, which creaked with every movement.

— Pituca... — I said, trying to ease the tension. — I respect you, but I don’t believe in that stuff. I’ve traveled many roads in my life. Don’t worry.

He looked at me for a long moment before responding.  
— There are things in this world, Jhonatan, that we don’t understand. And some of them... It’s better not to try.

I finished my drink and placed the glass on the counter with more force than I intended.  
— Maybe so, but I’ve made up my mind. I’m going anyway.

Pituca sighed, lowering his head, as if giving up on trying to convince me.  
— May God protect you, Jhonatan.

I placed some bills on the counter and walked toward the door.  
— See you around, Pituca. Don’t worry so much.

Pituca watched the door close with a creak, the sound echoing in the empty bar. He kept his eyes on the entrance as he murmured to himself:  
— May God go with you...

I climbed into my truck, that iron giant, a 1978 model that was my home on wheels. The smell of diesel oil and worn leather filled the cabin—a familiar, comforting scent that always accompanied me on the road.

I turned on the battery-powered radio I charged at gas stations, and the heavy sound of AC/DC began to play. “Highway to Hell” was the perfect soundtrack for the dusk unfolding before me. The clock read close to six in the evening, and the sun was setting on the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and red, as if it were drowning in a sea of fire.

Driving along the highway, my hands gripped the wheel firmly, feeling the vibration of the engine beneath me. The wind blew through the slightly open window, carrying the scent of damp earth and trees lining the road. It was a mix of freedom and loneliness that only life on the road could offer.

Cars passed by, and other trucks crossed my path, with drivers waving or flashing their lights in greeting. I returned the gesture with a brief wave, keeping my eyes on the road. The radio continued playing as I headed toward Vale Verde.

It took me about one or two hours to get near the place. It was a long trip, but I was used to the solitude and silence of the road, interrupted only by the electric guitars of AC/DC. It was 1979, and I was one of the few who had the luxury of a portable TV in my truck. I loved watching movies when parked at rest stops—a way to escape the monotonous routine.

As the sun disappeared below the horizon, the sky began to change. Dense clouds formed, painting the evening in shades of gray. The wind picked up, carrying the smell of rain that soon started to sprinkle on the windshield—tiny drops illuminated by the headlights.

Night fell, and the weather worsened. Lightning streaked across the sky like blades, illuminating the cornfield that appeared alongside the road. It was as if the heavens were at war with themselves.

An endless stretch of corn began to appear—tall green walls extending for miles. My boss had mentioned this, saying Vale Verde was famous for its cornfields and known as one of the greenest towns in the country. He also claimed that nearly all the residents were wealthy, owners of the sprawling fields.

I found it hard to believe. Brazil was a land of inequalities, and thinking an entire town could be wealthy sounded like one of those exaggerated trucker tales. Maybe just idle chatter. Either way, the landscape was both impressive and oppressive, with that sea of corn hemming in the road.

The rain thickened, falling heavy and relentless. The windshield wipers worked hard, leaving wet trails on the glass as the headlights seemed to dissolve in the curtain of water. The sound of AC/DC still played faintly, mixed with the pattering rain and distant thunderclaps.

Then I saw it.

A figure emerged from the cornfield by the roadside.

I slammed the brakes hard, the truck skidding several meters before coming to a stop. The sound of the tires screeching on the wet pavement echoed through the night.

  I jumped out of the truck, my heart racing as if trying to burst out of my chest. The rain was pouring down in torrents, soaking my clothes within seconds. The headlights illuminated a girl stumbling out of the cornfield.

She was covered in blood.

— Are you okay? — I shouted, running toward her. My voice felt small against the roar of the rain and thunder.

She didn’t respond. Her eyes were wide, her face pale, almost gray. Blood trickled from a cut on her forehead, mixing with the rain. She looked lost, her hair plastered to her face and her clothes torn.

— Hey, talk to me! — I insisted, carefully grabbing her shoulders. I could feel her body trembling under my hands.

She mumbled something, but it was impossible to understand over the noise around us. The only thing I could grasp was the metallic scent of blood mingling with the sweet, earthy smell of corn that seemed to permeate the air around us.

— What happened? — I asked, trying to drown out the storm’s noise.

She lifted her eyes to meet mine, filled with terror, and whispered something that chilled me to the bone:  
— They’re coming.

— Who? Who’s coming?

She started crying, her sobs muffled by the roaring wind. I pointed toward the truck.  
— Come on, I’ll get you out of here. Move!

The girl hesitated, glancing back at the cornfield. She looked emaciated, and beneath the torn clothes, her skin bore bruises and scars. My stomach turned as I noticed the raw, exposed flesh where one of her hands should have been.

The shock made me pause. Thoughts raced through my mind—a lunatic in Vale Verde, a pedophile who had assaulted her and mutilated her. What if he was watching me now, hidden in the cornfield, observing my every move?

My blood froze. Pituca’s words came flooding back: “Vale Verde is evil.” The place felt cursed, and though the rain had lightened, it still fell heavily, as if trying to bury everything beneath its weight.

Even without the wind, the rustling of the cornfield’s leaves grew louder, mingling with the sound of the raindrops hitting them. I glanced at the endless rows of corn, and the noise seemed to take on a life of its own. A chill ran down my spine, and the feeling of being watched became unbearable.

I ran back to the truck, my hands still smeared with the girl’s blood. I was drenched, but that was the least of my worries. I thought about returning to the bar, but it was too far. With no other choice, I continued down the road toward Vale Verde, leaving the girl’s body by the cornfield’s edge.

As I walked, surrounded by the endless rows of corn, a distant light appeared on the horizon. It was the town. A small sense of relief surfaced in the midst of the darkness.

Crossing into Vale Verde, I was met with an almost surreal sight: the town seemed untouched by the poverty I knew so well. Grand houses, luxurious mansions, and elegant buildings lined the streets—not a single structure could be described as humble. Even the smaller homes looked like they belonged in a European architecture magazine.

The rain still fell, cascading off the pristine roofs and paving the streets with an almost supernatural glow.

I reached the police station. Inside, a bald officer with white hair and a protruding belly looked at me over his glasses.  
— How can I help you, young man? — he asked in a deep, disinterested voice.

— I found a girl by the side of the road, — I said hesitantly.

He frowned.  
— You’re not from around here, are you, friend?

— I’m a trucker. I saw her on the road... Abused and missing a hand.

The officer sighed, as if he’d heard stories like this before.  
— Probably some wild animal.

Wild animal? I thought, confused. It would have to be a massive creature to do all that. But the way he said it so nonchalantly unnerved me.

The wet leather of my jacket, mixed with the iron scent of dried blood, was starting to make me nauseous. The station was cold and smelled of old paper and stale coffee. Outside, the sound of rain mingled with the distant rustling of the cornfield, its presence lingering like an unshakable shadow.

 — What’s your name, friend? — the officer asked casually, though his tone hinted at something more.

— Jhonatan Rodrigues.

— How old are you?

— I’m 20.

— And kids? Anyone who’d miss you?

The question caught me off guard.  
— Yeah... I have a wife and two kids. But why do you ask?

The officer gave a quick, almost awkward smile.  
— Nothing, nothing. Just part of the job. You know, gathering a bit of info here and there. Are you Christian, friend?

— I am. My whole family’s been baptized.

— Ah, good... — He paused, wiping his forehead as if deep in thought. — You’re here to deliver to the mayor, right?

— I think so.

— Alright, I’ll take care of your case. As soon as you unload the delivery, I’ll send a patrol to look for the girl.

— Alright.

I left the station with a strange feeling in my chest. I got into my truck and drove the load to the agreed location. As I navigated through Vale Verde’s streets, something deeply unsettled me. The city was luxurious, but it felt incomplete. There wasn’t a single church.

That struck me. Anywhere else in the country, it’s normal to see churches on every corner, next to bars or supermarkets. There’s always a cross marking the horizon of any small town. But here? Nothing.

I decided to keep my eyes open as I finished the job. I drove through several streets, crossing pristine avenues and perfectly symmetrical squares. The smell of rain mingled with the fresh aroma of flowers that seemed to grow in every garden. But the absence of churches continued to nag at me. Was it just exhaustion? Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me...

After unloading everything, I returned to the station. The officer greeted me with the same neutral expression as before, but there was something different in his tone now.  
— We didn’t find anyone. — The words came quickly, as if he wanted to end the conversation then and there.

— What do you mean? — I asked, almost in disbelief. — There was a dead girl! She was murdered!

The officer sighed, crossing his arms over his hefty belly.  
— Son, we sent a patrol, searched everywhere. We found nothing. No body, no sign of blood. Maybe you got confused.

The air in the station grew stifling. The smell of stale coffee mixed with the damp leather of my jacket felt stronger. I stared at the officer, trying to figure out if he was messing with me. But his face showed nothing but indifference.

Outside, the rain had stopped, but the sound of the cornfield seemed to echo, even from miles away. The city’s silence was almost supernatural, broken only by the wet boots of officers pacing back and forth. I knew what I had seen. I knew that girl had been there, that someone had hurt her.

— There was nothing. Not a drop of blood, — the officer said, his tone dry and sharp. — Maybe it was a wild animal you hit, and you mistook it for a girl.

— It was a girl! I’m sure of it! — I insisted, my voice rising louder than I intended.

The officer remained still, his heavy, judgmental gaze fixed on me.  
— We didn’t find anything, Mr. Jhonatan. You’d best get on your way. Here in Vale Verde, we don’t like outsiders causing trouble.

There was an uncomfortable pause before he added:  
— I’m sure you understand, especially drunken types like yourself. The stench of booze is reaching me from here.

I froze for a moment, feeling the weight of his words. Then, without another word, I left. I got into my truck, furious at the officer and at everything that seemed wrong with that town. It was nearly morning—probably around five o’clock.

The road was wet, but the rain had stopped, and the sky was beginning to brighten with the first rays of sunlight. As I drove, my mind replayed every detail.  The word the officer had said lingered in my mind. Something about him deeply unsettled me. Why had he asked if anyone would miss me? At the time, the adrenaline had kept me from processing it, but now, calmer, it seemed... sinister. And why did he want to know if I was baptized? The more I thought about it, the stranger it all seemed.

The wind began to pick up, and the endless rows of corn whispered constantly, almost like murmurs. There was something unnerving about that sound, as if the field had a life of its own, an unseen presence watching me. The damp smell of the earth mixed with the fresh scent of rain-soaked plants, creating an oppressive and uncomfortable atmosphere.

Then I passed the spot where I had found the little girl. I slowed down and looked more closely. My heart pounded. There it was—a massive, dark bloodstain, splattered across the asphalt. It was impossible to miss. My stomach turned as I noticed something even more disturbing: drag marks leading from the road into the cornfield.

She had been taken back there.

I stepped out of the truck, the cold morning air biting at my skin. The road was silent, except for the sinister rustling of the corn leaves, which seemed to mock me. I approached the edge of the cornfield, where the blood trails disappeared among the tall, dense stalks. A strong, metallic scent of blood hung in the air, mingling with the sweet, sickly smell of ripened corn.

I hesitated before stepping into the field, but something inside me screamed to stop. The sensation of being watched was almost tangible, as if hundreds of unseen eyes were staring at me through the stalks. The shadows of the cornfield seemed darker than they should have been at that hour, even with the sun rising.

Suddenly, the wind picked up, tossing the plants wildly in every direction. The sound was deafening, like a chorus of whispers spreading around me. My feet felt glued to the ground, but my instincts finally took over. I ran back to the truck, stumbling over my own legs, my breath quick and my heart pounding like a drum.

Once inside the cab, slamming the door shut, I felt momentarily safe. I glanced in the rearview mirror; the cornfield seemed still again, but I knew... something was there. Something that didn’t want to be seen.

As I sped down the road, one question hammered in my mind:

1i2wy42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1i2wy42/baby_got_second_degree_burns/,Baby got second degree burns !,"My 7 month old boy kid got second degree burns coz of hot coffee spilling over him. 

We had kept the hot drink at the edge of table over a plate and i moved aside for few seconds. He was quick enough to crawl and spill the coffee over him and further he had crawled over the drink which made his skin burn in chest, shoulder areas and also near palm in one of the hands. 


He was crying for almost entire day from the time we admitted him in hospital. 

They did a collagen dressing and doctors said his pain should subside in 2-3 days and full recovery would take 12-14 days. 

Will this leave any permanent scars on his body?and when is the earliest he can get back to normal and start playing. 
Will his skin grow back like before ? 

Bit nervous due to this incident as I am guilty and happened due to my negligence.

1i2wxw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1i2wxw2/the_last_one_for_the_road/,THE LAST ONE FOR THE ROAD,"— Give me one last drink. — The hoarse voice cut through the silence of the nearly empty bar, heavy with impatience.

The bartender, Pituca, glanced up as he wiped a glass with an already grimy rag. He cast a wary look at the man seated at the counter.  
— You shouldn’t be drinking, you know? — Pituca said, his tone hesitant but firm.

The man raised an eyebrow, almost mocking the advice.  
— One shot won’t hurt, Pituca. — He leaned slightly forward, resting his elbow on the counter. — Just to warm up before I hit the road.

Pituca sighed but didn’t move.  
— I don’t know about this... — he murmured, glancing sideways at the glass in his hand. — A lot of folks are crashing on those highways... Especially on the BRs.

— A bunch of cowards! — the man shot back with a wry smirk. — I’ve been doing this for years, Pituca. I know what I’m doing. Pour me that last drink. I’ve got a delivery to make tonight.

— Delivery? — Pituca asked, suspicious, as he set the glass down on the counter.

— Yeah. Heading to Vale Verde.

At the mention of that place, Pituca went pale. He froze, the rag suspended mid-air, his face ghostly white. He said nothing. Turning reluctantly, he began preparing the drink.

Meanwhile, the man glanced around. The bar was nearly empty, the yellowish light casting strange shadows on the walls. Outside, the sound of a cricket seemed to grow louder by the second, as if warning of something.

Pituca placed the glass on the counter, his hand trembling slightly.  
— Good luck. — His voice was almost a whisper.

The man shrugged, grabbed the glass, and downed it in one gulp. Rising from his seat, he noticed Pituca’s unnerved expression.  
— Pituca, you okay? — I asked, staring at the old bartender. He seemed uneasy, his face paler than usual, his eyes fixed on some invisible point on the counter.

He took a few seconds to respond, and when he finally raised his eyes, his expression was grave.  
— If I were you, Jhonatan... I wouldn’t go there.

— Wouldn’t go where? — I asked, raising an eyebrow. The unexpected reply piqued my curiosity.

— To Vale Verde. — His tone was low, almost a whisper, as if he didn’t want anyone else to hear, even though the bar was empty except for the two of us.

I laughed, trying to lighten the mood.  
— Ah, Pituca... What’s this about? Since when do you believe in that nonsense? You’re starting to sound like my mom with those scary bedtime stories.

Pituca didn’t smile. He just shook his head slowly and pressed his lips together. Worry seemed etched into every line of his aged face.  
— I’ve heard stories about that place since I was a kid, Jhonatan. — He sighed, crossing his arms on the counter. — That place is bad. Real bad.

— Bad how, Pituca? Come on, you’re kidding.

He leaned in closer, his voice now laden with unsettling seriousness.  
— People disappear there, Jhonatan. No explanation, no trace. They just vanish. Especially kids.

The last phrase stopped my laughter before it even started.  
— Kids? — I asked, now paying attention.

— Yeah. They get lost in the rows of cornfields and are never seen again. — He gestured outside, as if he could visualize the place he was describing. — And there’s no point in searching. They never find anything. Just emptiness... And a strange silence.

— Alright, alright. — I raised my hands, still half-smiling. — Just because someone got lost in the fields doesn’t mean the place is cursed, right?

Pituca was silent for a moment, his gaze fixed on me.  
— A kid showed up here the other day. Must’ve been about 18, full of bravado. He came with his girlfriend.

I leaned in, intrigued.  
— And?

He sighed before continuing.  
— Said he was going to Vale Verde. I tried to warn him. Told him everything I could. But he just laughed in my face.

— What did he say? — I asked, curious.

Pituca closed his eyes for a moment, as if trying to push away the unsettling memory.  
— He looked at me and said, “I’m taking my girl to the Vale Verde cornfield. It’s gonna be the best night of my life. You’ll see, you old coward.”

I laughed briefly, but the sound came out nervous.  
— Bold kid. Teenagers always think they know everything, huh?

Pituca didn’t find it funny.  
— Yeah, I thought the same thing at the time. But a few days later, his parents showed up here. The girl’s mother too.

— Looking for them? — I asked, my tone now more serious.

He nodded.  
— They came in desperation, asking if I knew anything. I told them what I knew—that they’d gone to Vale Verde.

— And then?

Pituca shook his head slowly.  
— Never heard from them again. Not the parents. Not the girl’s mother. No one.

The silence that fell over the bar was uncomfortable, like a weight settling over the room. Outside, the wind howled softly, pushing the door, which creaked with every movement.

— Pituca... — I said, trying to ease the tension. — I respect you, but I don’t believe in that stuff. I’ve traveled many roads in my life. Don’t worry.

He looked at me for a long moment before responding.  
— There are things in this world, Jhonatan, that we don’t understand. And some of them... It’s better not to try.

I finished my drink and placed the glass on the counter with more force than I intended.  
— Maybe so, but I’ve made up my mind. I’m going anyway.

Pituca sighed, lowering his head, as if giving up on trying to convince me.  
— May God protect you, Jhonatan.

I placed some bills on the counter and walked toward the door.  
— See you around, Pituca. Don’t worry so much.

Pituca watched the door close with a creak, the sound echoing in the empty bar. He kept his eyes on the entrance as he murmured to himself:  
— May God go with you...

I climbed into my truck, that iron giant, a 1978 model that was my home on wheels. The smell of diesel oil and worn leather filled the cabin—a familiar, comforting scent that always accompanied me on the road.

I turned on the battery-powered radio I charged at gas stations, and the heavy sound of AC/DC began to play. “Highway to Hell” was the perfect soundtrack for the dusk unfolding before me. The clock read close to six in the evening, and the sun was setting on the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and red, as if it were drowning in a sea of fire.

Driving along the highway, my hands gripped the wheel firmly, feeling the vibration of the engine beneath me. The wind blew through the slightly open window, carrying the scent of damp earth and trees lining the road. It was a mix of freedom and loneliness that only life on the road could offer.

Cars passed by, and other trucks crossed my path, with drivers waving or flashing their lights in greeting. I returned the gesture with a brief wave, keeping my eyes on the road. The radio continued playing as I headed toward Vale Verde.

It took me about one or two hours to get near the place. It was a long trip, but I was used to the solitude and silence of the road, interrupted only by the electric guitars of AC/DC. It was 1979, and I was one of the few who had the luxury of a portable TV in my truck. I loved watching movies when parked at rest stops—a way to escape the monotonous routine.

As the sun disappeared below the horizon, the sky began to change. Dense clouds formed, painting the evening in shades of gray. The wind picked up, carrying the smell of rain that soon started to sprinkle on the windshield—tiny drops illuminated by the headlights.

Night fell, and the weather worsened. Lightning streaked across the sky like blades, illuminating the cornfield that appeared alongside the road. It was as if the heavens were at war with themselves.

An endless stretch of corn began to appear—tall green walls extending for miles. My boss had mentioned this, saying Vale Verde was famous for its cornfields and known as one of the greenest towns in the country. He also claimed that nearly all the residents were wealthy, owners of the sprawling fields.

I found it hard to believe. Brazil was a land of inequalities, and thinking an entire town could be wealthy sounded like one of those exaggerated trucker tales. Maybe just idle chatter. Either way, the landscape was both impressive and oppressive, with that sea of corn hemming in the road.

The rain thickened, falling heavy and relentless. The windshield wipers worked hard, leaving wet trails on the glass as the headlights seemed to dissolve in the curtain of water. The sound of AC/DC still played faintly, mixed with the pattering rain and distant thunderclaps.

Then I saw it.

A figure emerged from the cornfield by the roadside.

I slammed the brakes hard, the truck skidding several meters before coming to a stop. The sound of the tires screeching on the wet pavement echoed through the night.

  I jumped out of the truck, my heart racing as if trying to burst out of my chest. The rain was pouring down in torrents, soaking my clothes within seconds. The headlights illuminated a girl stumbling out of the cornfield.

She was covered in blood.

— Are you okay? — I shouted, running toward her. My voice felt small against the roar of the rain and thunder.

She didn’t respond. Her eyes were wide, her face pale, almost gray. Blood trickled from a cut on her forehead, mixing with the rain. She looked lost, her hair plastered to her face and her clothes torn.

— Hey, talk to me! — I insisted, carefully grabbing her shoulders. I could feel her body trembling under my hands.

She mumbled something, but it was impossible to understand over the noise around us. The only thing I could grasp was the metallic scent of blood mingling with the sweet, earthy smell of corn that seemed to permeate the air around us.

— What happened? — I asked, trying to drown out the storm’s noise.

She lifted her eyes to meet mine, filled with terror, and whispered something that chilled me to the bone:  
— They’re coming.

— Who? Who’s coming?

She started crying, her sobs muffled by the roaring wind. I pointed toward the truck.  
— Come on, I’ll get you out of here. Move!

The girl hesitated, glancing back at the cornfield. She looked emaciated, and beneath the torn clothes, her skin bore bruises and scars. My stomach turned as I noticed the raw, exposed flesh where one of her hands should have been.

The shock made me pause. Thoughts raced through my mind—a lunatic in Vale Verde, a pedophile who had assaulted her and mutilated her. What if he was watching me now, hidden in the cornfield, observing my every move?

My blood froze. Pituca’s words came flooding back: “Vale Verde is evil.” The place felt cursed, and though the rain had lightened, it still fell heavily, as if trying to bury everything beneath its weight.

Even without the wind, the rustling of the cornfield’s leaves grew louder, mingling with the sound of the raindrops hitting them. I glanced at the endless rows of corn, and the noise seemed to take on a life of its own. A chill ran down my spine, and the feeling of being watched became unbearable.

I ran back to the truck, my hands still smeared with the girl’s blood. I was drenched, but that was the least of my worries. I thought about returning to the bar, but it was too far. With no other choice, I continued down the road toward Vale Verde, leaving the girl’s body by the cornfield’s edge.

As I walked, surrounded by the endless rows of corn, a distant light appeared on the horizon. It was the town. A small sense of relief surfaced in the midst of the darkness.

Crossing into Vale Verde, I was met with an almost surreal sight: the town seemed untouched by the poverty I knew so well. Grand houses, luxurious mansions, and elegant buildings lined the streets—not a single structure could be described as humble. Even the smaller homes looked like they belonged in a European architecture magazine.

The rain still fell, cascading off the pristine roofs and paving the streets with an almost supernatural glow.

I reached the police station. Inside, a bald officer with white hair and a protruding belly looked at me over his glasses.  
— How can I help you, young man? — he asked in a deep, disinterested voice.

— I found a girl by the side of the road, — I said hesitantly.

He frowned.  
— You’re not from around here, are you, friend?

— I’m a trucker. I saw her on the road... Abused and missing a hand.

The officer sighed, as if he’d heard stories like this before.  
— Probably some wild animal.

Wild animal? I thought, confused. It would have to be a massive creature to do all that. But the way he said it so nonchalantly unnerved me.

The wet leather of my jacket, mixed with the iron scent of dried blood, was starting to make me nauseous. The station was cold and smelled of old paper and stale coffee. Outside, the sound of rain mingled with the distant rustling of the cornfield, its presence lingering like an unshakable shadow.

 — What’s your name, friend? — the officer asked casually, though his tone hinted at something more.

— Jhonatan Rodrigues.

— How old are you?

— I’m 20.

— And kids? Anyone who’d miss you?

The question caught me off guard.  
— Yeah... I have a wife and two kids. But why do you ask?

The officer gave a quick, almost awkward smile.  
— Nothing, nothing. Just part of the job. You know, gathering a bit of info here and there. Are you Christian, friend?

— I am. My whole family’s been baptized.

— Ah, good... — He paused, wiping his forehead as if deep in thought. — You’re here to deliver to the mayor, right?

— I think so.

— Alright, I’ll take care of your case. As soon as you unload the delivery, I’ll send a patrol to look for the girl.

— Alright.

I left the station with a strange feeling in my chest. I got into my truck and drove the load to the agreed location. As I navigated through Vale Verde’s streets, something deeply unsettled me. The city was luxurious, but it felt incomplete. There wasn’t a single church.

That struck me. Anywhere else in the country, it’s normal to see churches on every corner, next to bars or supermarkets. There’s always a cross marking the horizon of any small town. But here? Nothing.

I decided to keep my eyes open as I finished the job. I drove through several streets, crossing pristine avenues and perfectly symmetrical squares. The smell of rain mingled with the fresh aroma of flowers that seemed to grow in every garden. But the absence of churches continued to nag at me. Was it just exhaustion? Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me...

After unloading everything, I returned to the station. The officer greeted me with the same neutral expression as before, but there was something different in his tone now.  
— We didn’t find anyone. — The words came quickly, as if he wanted to end the conversation then and there.

1i2wxic,https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1i2wxic/on_the_fence_in_regards_to_fold_6/,On the fence in regards to Fold 6,"Hey everyone. Soo, I currently have an S22 Ultra and I'm honestly not sure if I should go for a Fold 6 or not. There are some things that are worrying me:

1. even with the 5000 mAh battery, I charge the s22 at least once in the middle of the day. This is due to the fact that the phone runs almost 24/7. I'm either playing some game during my morning coffee, watching a movie at night, or have YouTube Music running in the background whenever it's closed (yes, even through the night, can't sleep without music). I'm not sure how satisfied I'll be with the 4400 mAh battery on a Fold. 

2. I'm worried about the inner screen. The fact that it can get scratched even by fingernails is a bit insane to me, not gonna lie. 

3. I won't sugarcoat it, I'm 23 and although not a party guy, parties aren't that uncommon either. I've dropped this guy on multiple occasions when I was buzzed. The S22 took it like a champ. No broken screen, no nothing (I used to have an Unicorn Beetle Pro case, but switched to Shein cases about a year ago, as I wanted something that looks nice and I worried less about protection). Given that the Fold 6 has quite a few sensitive parts, including the hinge and the inner screen, I'm not sure how well it will hold up. 

4. Cameras, meh. I know they're worse than the Ultra lineup, but I'm not too crazy about pictures. 

5. Not only are the cases quite limited, it seems like whatever I'll choose, the hinge will get scratched. I had my eyes on the Spigen Slim Armor, as plenty of people seem to recommend it, but I've found posts where even that case scratched the hinge. I'm not the kinda guy that takes the case off weekly to clean the device. I like putting it on and forgetting about it. I usually take off the case and clean it up perhaps around once or twice a year. Due to the space between the hinge protection and the hinge itself, it seems like this will result in scratches 100%.

I'm mainly eyeing the Fold 6 for the below reasons:

1. It folds. It seems fun and I'd love to change things up a bit. 

2. I watch quite a lot of movies and I like doing so on the phone while laying in bed, so no TV or laptop/PC. Soo... Despite the black lines due to the weird aspect ratio, I guess the bigger screen will help to some degree.

3. A bigger screen would be fun for the games I play while I'm having my coffee in the morning, just to waste some time. Things like Top Heroes, Legend of Slime, things that do not require lots of resources or high tech hardware. 

4. The pretty good processor. It'd be fun to try running AetherXS2 to see if I can emulate Playstation 2 games on it. I tried it on the S22 Ultra and it'd overheat in an instant. 

5. Size. I hate putting the S22 Ultra in my pocket. Due to this, I mainly use the Ultra while I'm at home and take an iPhone 12 around when going out and I know I won't really need/use the phone much. That being said, having 2 phones becomes tiring at one point and I don't really like iOS. So I thought, hey, I'll have at least an S22 Ultra screen size while at home, and a nice, somewhat compact phone to keep in my pocket without it annoying me. 

As you can see, I'm mainly using my phone for fun and I'm not that productive on it. If I wanna work on something, I'd much rather use my laptop. That's why I don't think I'll use the Fold 6 as the multitasking monster that it is. 

And I'm also not excited for the release of S25 Ultra next week because, well, at least for what I do with it, it'll feel like pretty much the exact same phone with rounded corners. Not even the novelty factor that a Fold would provide. I don't think it's worth the upgrade. 

Soo... Any advice that you could give me? Should I go for a Fold 6, or is it not for me? What are your experiences with it?

So, I'm currently trying to lose weight again and thus, I can't emotional eat as much as I did before. Up until recently, there was no way I could've gotten the willpower to do this but somehow I'm managing for a week now - with the main issue being that I feel like an emotional mess after my morning coffee has faded and I can't 'eat the pain away'. I am getting therapy, obviously, but I'm only at the start of that so there's not much that can be done yet with helping me. I need a way to calm my racing mind when this happens and I'm not sure how x-x

1i2ws6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/1i2ws6g/finding_balance/,Finding Balance ,"I’ve been trying to understand what I believe might be orthorexia, though I’m not entirely sure if it’s a recognized diagnosis or how it’s classified. I’ve struggled with feeling like I can only eat whole or extremely healthy foods. Whenever I eat something indulgent or less nutrient dense, I often spiral into binge eating for months, which is clearly not healthy.

For the longest time, even simple things like adding a teaspoon of sugar to a recipe—like a cucumber salad—would make me feel like I had to swap it for honey or leave it out entirely because I was so fixated on eating clean, wholesome foods.

This year, however, I’ve started challenging some of those rigid beliefs. For example, I now start my mornings with coffee mixed with protein powder. Previously, I would have avoided protein powder entirely because it’s highly processed and contains artificial sweeteners, which I had always avoided. In the past, I would only use natural sweeteners like fruit, honey, or maple syrup. But now, I’ve found that this drink is not only super easy to prepare and satisfying to me, but also provides 24 grams of protein.

I still prioritize whole meats, fruit, and vegetables throughout the day, but I’ve also started incorporating things like water flavoring packets that contain artificial sweeteners, flavors, and colors—something I would have never considered before. Surprisingly, I feel that these changes are helping me. Even though I sometimes experience cognitive dissonance when consuming these things, it’s becoming easier, and I’ve realized they aren’t really harming me in any way.

I’m curious if others have gone through something similar, and I’d love to hear different perspectives on this journey toward finding balance.",2,1737054961.0,BingeEatingDisorder,2,1.0,False

I've seen it multiple times and this is her first time viewing it. She wasn't a fan of Breaking Bad, but has so far really enjoyed Saul.

We just had just passed the scene where Nacho swapped Hector's pills while cooly walking towards the kitchen. This is where my wife asks ""So he's going to die now, right?""

Me (confused): No, he was successful. The pills went in the coat

Wife: I saw that. That's not why he's been caught. I meant the cook is obviously going to turn him in. So Nacho needs to murder the Cook. Unless the Cook has his own agenda and is going to blackmail him.

Me: No your way off, none of that is going to happen. Why would you suspect that?

Wife: Well the big window. The Cook stands in front of it when he's cooking and he's always cooking. He's right behind Hector and can clearly see everything that goes on in front. It's a big window with a small eating area. The only place he wouldn't be able to see is anyone on the far side where the coffee station is at.

I rewind and watch the scene over and I gotta say she was right. The Cook was right there and can clearly see almost everything Nacho was doing. We both started laughing at this and talking about how the Cook must want Hector dead to.

1i2wqvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/WegovyWeightLoss/comments/1i2wqvy/general_advice_for_semaglutide/,General Advice for Semaglutide ,"**\*Note\*** *I typed this up as a response to another Reddit post, but I kept getting an error and it wouldn't let me reply. So, I figured I'll just start a new thread, and maybe this post could help someone else. I encourage everyone to share if you've had a similar or contradictory experience, as this will be most helpful for new patients or people experiencing negative side effects.*

*--------------------------------------------------------*

Try not to get discouraged like I did. Be patient. **I almost gave up after 4 months because of minimal and slow results, as well as nausea.** The ramp-up to the therapeutic dosage feels like it takes forever—especially if you’re paying outrageous amounts for your prescription. The side effects can also be brutal sometimes *(varies greatly by person, but I suffered—and still do—from nausea).* I encourage you to continue researching, and discuss any major side effects with your doctor as soon as possible.

It took me a long time to realize that I get nauseous from:  
**a)** **NOT eating.** Strangely enough, once you hit your therapeutic dose, you may go an entire day and realize you haven’t eaten anything at all. To prevent this, I set up a mental reminder at the same time every night: *""Shoot, it’s 7 PM...did I eat anything today?""* It is truly bizarre the first few times it happens, but eating is the last thing you want to do when nauseous, so it's important you listen to your body and eat when you're hungry. If you're already nauseous, I recommend forcing yourself to eat a little of something off the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, apple sauce, or toast).

As a 340-pound 30-something-year-old, 6'2"" male, I used to eat 4 or 5 meals a day. Now, I usually go 16 hours with only coffee, which has turned into a convenient *(and lax)* **16/8 intermittent-fasting** schedule. *(I usually skip breakfast and lunch, completely satiated by coffee. If I do get hungry, I’ll have an apple, banana, granola bar, or something small to hold me over.)*

**b)** Eating **greasy** and **heavily processed foods**. I also experienced an aversion to saucy foods *(even dipping sauces—and I have always been a sauce person).* Many foods I used to absolutely love, like pork shoulder (carnitas tacos), deep fried chicken, fried mushrooms, mayonnaise, even some cheeseburgers! 

This is, admittedly, *surprisingly* difficult to adjust to, especially when, all of a sudden, you don’t enjoy foods you’ve loved your entire life. This might sound silly, but it can be *startling,* a bit *confusing,* and even a little *devastating* when you realize you can't lean on food to make you feel better (albeit temporarily) anymore. For the first time in my life, I genuinely didn't even want one slice of that cheesy and saucy Meat Lover’s pizza dunked in garlic butter *(I'd normally have eaten 5+ slices before, dunking every bite into ranch or some other sauce!).* I had to completely rework my brain for grocery shopping, as I no longer craved savory foods, and I now rarely felt the desire to eat out. I personally developed a new craving: sweets. Thankfully, not too sweet. All of a sudden, foods like apples, bananas, Greek yogurt, and applesauce became *absolutely delicious* and satisfying, and are now staples in my diet. Rice, beans, protein bars, peanut butter, bread, and ground turkey have also become essential. However, many of my ***favorite foods*** suddenly **made me feel sick** or just **did not taste good at all anymore**.

But it took me about 6 months before I really started to see consistent weight loss. And then, as if someone flipped a switch in my body, the weight just started coming off with ease. **It is crucial that you learn to listen to your body.** I used to just eat to eat, or eat out of habit, or eat out of boredom...but this medication has taught me to pay much closer attention to my body's signals. If I’m not physically feeling a pang of hunger, I do not eat—because I’m not hungry. Sounds simple, right? Unfortunately, it’s *much more difficult* than it sounds. It took me about 6 months to really start to tune in, but now I'm usually pretty good about only eating when I’m actually hungry. Sometimes, what feels like hunger might actually be thirst, so staying hydrated can help ensure you’re interpreting your body’s signals correctly. **I consume an absurd amount of water every day, and I encourage you to do the same.**

A quick Google search says drinking more water on semaglutide *(and during weight loss in general)* is beneficial because it can help you tell the difference between hunger and thirst, **reduce side effects** like nausea, constipation, and headaches, **give your metabolism a little boost,** promote fat loss over muscle loss, **keep your skin hydrated and elastic to help reduce loose skin,** keep you energized for physical activity, make you feel fuller when you drink water before meals, and even prevent dry mouth and bad breath *(which are pretty common on semaglutide).*

Anyways, now, one and a half years later, **I’m down 122 pounds.** This medication has changed my life in ways I can’t even begin to describe. Obesity impacts every part of life—physical, mental, emotional, and even spiritual—and all I can say is that it feels incredible to finally *be myself* again. To truly *live* again.

I hope you stick with it and have minimal side effects, as it can *absolutely* change your life. **It is a long and challenging journey, but one I assure you is worth it.**

I have one final piece of advice, and while it might not seem super helpful at first, I’d argue it’s *the most important* **if you ever feel like quitting.** Whenever you feel discouraged, **remind yourself of how being overweight makes you** ***feel***\*\*.\*\* Think about how many times you’ve said, ***""I wish I wasn’t fat.""*** Remind yourself of all the times it’s made you feel **depressed, isolated,** or ***envious*** *of thin people.* Think about every diet, every trip to the gym, and every attempt at some new method to **“change.”** If you’re anything like me, you’re **fucking tired of it.** That alone was enough to push me to keep going—and I can’t stress enough how *thankful* I am that I didn’t give up.

So, if anybody in Zwolle is in a similar situation or is looking for more friends, I would love to meet. I enjoy going out for a coffee or playing board games (Catan is an addiction in my family).

1i2wkee,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1i2wkee/im_just_a_bit_miffed/,I'm just a bit miffed ,"My (38F) roommate gets on my fuckin nerves. They (35, not saying gender so I don't out myself) are always judging me for existing and passing their responsibilities on to me. 

I work from home a couple days a week, which is supposed to be time I can just knock out all my busy work or deep-focus tasks for the week without being interrupted constantly (I work the front desk so it's literally every 3 minutes that someone tries to get my attention). They decided, without asking, that I would be baby sitting their dogs on those days. 

Don't get me wrong, I love these pups with my whole entire being, but like.... I specifically work from home so I can have that uninterrupted time. I cant be quieting them every time someone walks past the apartment, I cant be quieting them while I'm in meetings, I really can't afford to take them on hour long walks 2 to 3 times per day. I've expressed that the level of care I can offer just isn't as good as what they can do when they bring their dogs to work (which theyre allowed to do they just don't seem to feel like it when I technically can be home with them). 

They also got really upset with me for unexpectedly working from home one day due to bad weather because I could have watched the dogs for them, and they told me if I'm coming home early I should let them know so  that, if they do leave the small, older dog at home, they know that I'm ""socializing"" with her and they don't need to rush home to pick her up. 

Again, love these pups, would lay down my life for them, but they're not my responsibility. Just because I agree to walk them when roommate isn't feeling up to it, or feed them if roommate will be home late, or other little tasks doesn't mean I can be a part-time unpaid dogsitter. I also don't think it's okay to make demands of time or to ask me to check in with them if I happen to deviate from my routine. 

I've started going in to the office (or literally anywhere, coffee shop, library, etc.) and just lying that I don't have a choice and my boss is making me. 

Normally I'd have no problem telling them straight up that I just can't do it and frankly don't want to, but they give me the silent treatment and resent me constantly when I bring stuff up. 

They also do the following all the time: 
-have no respect for my stuff (I told them that some kitchen stuff needs to be hand washed and that I am happy to do that even if they were the one to use it. I told them this twice. On the third time they said ""it's been fine every time I've done it"". Yeah, I've been jumping on the dishes every since.) 
-have no respect for me (whatever specific request I make, they just fucking ignore it) 
-have no respect for my time (we host a small get together in the middle of the work week. I have begged to move it to the weekend or on Friday night and they said ""these people have lives, no one will show up on the weekend"" and then made a group text telling all of them it's gonna be mid-week, every week, I guess until we die??? Idk) 
-are always fucking lyingggg!!!! I don't ask for anything, but they offered to do some stuff for me like take me to the airport only to bail last minute. They'll agree to go to shows or events with me (and be my ride, since I can't drive due to a disability) and then bail the day of because they're ""not feeling it"". Like, bruh, don't try to be nice to me if you're going to be a disappointment. Just refrain. I'd rather you tell me to eat shit and die than throw a wrench in my plans. 

We are friends aside from this, they're not a bad person by any means and I could definitely be more assertive, but it is really exhausting. I find myself trying to predict and preempt them, or just leaving and staying out of their way because I don't have the energy to deal with the bullshit. 

We were initially going to move into the next place together, but I had only said I was open to it if the place met *all* of my requirements (under 20min bus ride to and from work, near a grocery store, close to the center of town) and I wouldn't budge on that. I've budgeted and researched and I know that I can do a 1 bed by myself so I didn't care if they were on board or not. They said they obviously wanted someplace dog friendly but otherwise had no preference. 

Then when we're looking at places, literally supposed to go look at one the next day, they tell me they're gonna move in with their partner. I say no worries, continue the search on my own, good to go. 
Then they broke up with their partner and now they wanna move in with me again but this time they want to move like 40 minutes away by car (literally 2 hour bus ride one way for me). I say ""nope can't do it"" and they got upset! They had the audacity to be upset! They were like ""no I'll be your ride every day, it's fine"" and I was like ""absolutely not, don't ask again"". What do they do? Get all judgey about my furniture choices. Ridiculous. Sometimes I wonder how they even have friends with their head so far up their ass. 

Idk if we'll keep talking after the move in April, idk if they even think of me as a real friend or just someone they can boss around. I'm just keeping the peace until then by staying in my room and getting take out, fuck that noise, fuck that attitude.

1i2wiy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1i2wiy7/how_jehovahs_witnesses_destroyed_my_life/,How Jehovah's Witnesses destroyed my life.,"1987 December 24 The day it all started

This is the day that my life changed forever. I came from a family that belonged to a cult, religious, Jehovah’s Witnesses. My upbringing was harsh, and cruel and full of punishments. I was born into this religion, and had no choice but to try to make it through. I had very little happy memories, but Little did my Husband know about the things he would have to help me get through.

My earliest memories consisted of going to the Kingdom Hall three times a Week, and Going in door to door preaching every Saturday Morning. There was no deviation from this schedule. I suffered from debilitating migraine headaches from age of 7 on. If I wasn’t throwing up, I was accused by my parents of faking it. I was getting two to three a week in the beginning. My mother was on a health kick, so I was not taken to a proper medical doctor, I was not allowed to take Aspirin, and they didn’t allow any junk food, so no ginger ale in the early years. The suffering was so harsh, I remember being in my room, holding my head so many times, with no relief. My mother would take me to chiropractors, and anyone with a suggestion to give, she would try, just not go to the Doctor. Little did I know that this was the beginning of the abuse I would suffer from. I later on found out from my doctor, that Caffeine would help a lot, so if I could have one Diet Coke a day, it kept them away, I to this day have to have caffeine everyday. As I can easily slip back into Migraines and nausea.

My earliest memories of being a Jehovah’s Witness consisted of attending meetings three days a week, and Saturday Morning door to door ministry, we were made to attend and participate in all activities from infancy on. Since I don’t remember my infancy, I did however witness my siblings in this religion. I am the oldest of seven children. If the babies would fuss or squirm, or not want to sit still for the two hour meetings, they were taken into the back and spanked hard, to be taught to sit still as an infant, you would hear the children in the back room screaming from being spanked, and not just one swat on a diaper, the harsh slap on bare skin of the legs more than 4–5 times. At that age, they were not even talking or walking yet, and would have to be disciplined for what….they didn’t know. And my parents weren’t the only ones doing it, all the parents did this to the babies, to get them to shut up and sit still, during adult sermons, that we had no idea what was going on, but too afraid to move for the chance of getting beat.

When I was about five years old, we were at the kingdom hall doing cleaning with our entire congregation. The ones in charge gave me and another young girl my age a rag and was told to go dust off the letters on the sign in the yard. The letters were made of Styrofoam, and as we dusted they kept crumbling off like snow on the grass by our feet, we thought since the bases were painted white on the sign, that we were doing a good job getting all the Styrofoam off to reveal the letters underneath. But not even half way through, we were spotted and stopped immediately. The little girl was scolded by her parents, and sat in a chair as punishment. But my father who was trying to show that his family was obedient took me by the wrist and had me stand with my hands on the back row of the chairs in the kingdom hall and he spanked my bare legs and spanked and spanked, till my knees buckled, and he finally said go sit down, you are going to die in Armageddon because Jehovah Hates what you did. I was reminded about this for weeks, I was told to look at the pictures in the Revelation book on the beast with all the heads was going to attack me. I was so scared, I made myself physically ill having to go to the kingdom hall and face all the ones there after what I did. I was called the naughty little girl for months after this. I would cry at night, I would hide under my covers, and be so scared that Armageddon was starting right now.

The incidents like this were getting more frequent, my brothers were getting beat for little things like having a toy on the floor, we had to have our toys picked up all the time. My parents were focused on us being the perfect little family, so the use harsh punishments in order to keep us in line, Most of the time, my mother would get us dressed, hair combed, and made to sit on the couch for over an hour to get ready for the meetings. So more sitting, no tv, nothing. Sit there quietly and wait.

When my mother had her fifth child, one of my brothers, that is when the perfect little family HAD to be. At all cost, at each of the meetings, which lasted two hours each, one night was a one hour meeting. It was 2 hours on Sunday, 2 hours on Thursday Night, and 1 hour on Tuesday night. This is a rough one, I still have issues with listening attentively in meetings, work or anything. We sat in a row at the kingdom hall in front of my parents. My parents sat directly behind us in the next row, with the babies of the family. My mother would slick our hair back with Dippity Dew, and put it in tight perfect pony tails or braids, which with my migraines would be so painful. Then she would put Vaseline on our faces, so that we shined. We many times had matching outfits. THEN the worst started happening, which went on till I was in my 20’s. It started at about age 10. If we moved our heads to look to the right or the left, we got a mark, if we looked down too long to read the scripture from the bible verse being referenced, we got a mark, if we talked, you got a mark, if you got up to go to the bathroom, you got a mark, if you didn’t raise your hand and get called on at least once, you got a mark. BUT the ride home in the car, was awful, no talking, can you imagine, 7 children in a station wagon, no talking at all, with your dad repeating, YUP its going to be Belts Baths and BED! You didn’t know how many marks she put there under your name, sometimes written on the watchtower, sometimes in her notebook. WE were lined up on the table, or bookcase, and Dad had us drop our underwear, and lift our skirts, for the boys, bare butts by dropping the pants and underwear, so it didn’t matter if you were having your period, drop your underwear to the floor. then bare your butt, as mom yelled out the number of hash marks she had for each of us, and that was how many belt whips you got, so if you moved your head wrong during the meeting, you got that many whips. It was so harsh, and if you dropped down, or moved too much you got more. Then we would all be told to go to bed. Until the next meeting, and then it happened all over again. I HATED MEETING DAYS! With my migraines, they were worse, the stress of going to the meeting would bring on so many.

Another horrible memory every meeting, if I stood in the back talking to a friend, and if my feet were not directly straight not pointed out in a V, my dad would walk by me, and kick my foot and say, are you a duck now? My friends would wonder what he was doing. I couldn’t say, it was so humiliating as a young teenager, Also he would walk by certain friends who he didn’t like for whatever reason, and say “BASHA” Bad Association Spoils Useful Habits! My friends never knew what Basha meant, so embarrassing.

So as the years went on, I was told to pioneer, which was putting lots of hours in the door to door ministry, I hated it, I didn’t believe the teachings, and if I asked any questions, I was told I was an apostate, and wouldn’t be seeing my dead relatives in the new kingdom. I had to be perfect. Or Armageddon would kill me with those beasts from Revelation.

I met a wonderful man at my work, and he ended up asking me to marry him years later. I was told no by my parents, when he gave me a beautiful ring, I was made to give it back. I was heartbroken, I thought will I ever get out of here, The beatings, and violence in the house was getting worse. I had two black eyes that year, and I don’t need to talk about that too. But it never got better, just worse every day.

When I was 19 I wrote my mom a letter, I vowed to work, and support her and the kids if she would just divorce my dad. PLEASE I begged her, she just said, oh how sweet. But nothing. Every year would pass, and I just kept thinking, I am never getting out of this mess. No one will ever want to be involved with this crazy family. During this period, I started hiding in my closet, more and more. Trying to shrink down to as small as I could and hoping no one would find me. All during this time, no tv, no radios, you must be studying if you had any free time the Jehovah’s Witness books, magazines, and materials. No outside reading of anything even if it was school related.

During my next three years till I was 22, the violence in the house got really bad, my dad was beating my little brother age 10 by sitting on him, and using his fists to pummel his little face, he was unconscious, and my dad wouldn’t stop, I was furious, my mom was hanging some pictures in the living room, and had a hammer on the coffee table, I picked it up, and hit my dad on the back of the head. WOE he blew up, turned around, and backhanded me across the face, I had my own car, so I grabbed my keys, and left, I drove to my Aunt and Uncles house, with a huge black eye, and bruised face. I only weighed about 109 lbs. and he was a big 5'10"" and over 200 lbs. I was hoping that since my uncle was a Jehovah’s Witness Elder, that he would help me, I begged, but he called my parents, and my dad said she needs to come home, I am pressing charges on her, and calling the police for battery. I shook all the way home, I had a massive migraine coming on, so I broke down, and went through a McDonalds to get a diet coke with ice. I didn’t even realize that it would help me to get rid of the migraines. Well that proved to be a mistake, when I got home, they were waiting for me, the elders from the Kingdom Hall had called a committee to punish me for hitting my dad one time. I couldn’t believe it. My dad always went outside to pass gas, and he stepped out during the meeting in the living room, and he saw the McDonalds cup in my car. He came in with the cup, threw it at me, and said that for my willful disobedience, he wanted me disfellowshipped right away. I was crying, and the elders said that I brought all this on myself for disobedience.

I vowed to never get involved again, I want to bring up another subject that will go back to my age 14. My dad and mom were both very bad with money, we would go for weeks with just one pack of chicken drumsticks and bread that my mom made. and we had broth with no chicken, no veggies, and bread. We very rarely had money for groceries, but my dad could go to football games in Chicago, and go out for dinner, and take my mom to the islands. But we would go through feast and famine. It was rough. So when I was 14 my mom wanted to go get a waitress job to supplement the income from my dad. Who was a corporate sales man with a company car and expense account. So she wanted me to go with her on Friday and Saturday nights to bus her tables. I did this until I was 16, I earned a paycheck, which my parents kept, and if I asked for anything, I was told, ok fine, pick one kid to not eat….is that what you want to do you selfish little girl. Then at age 16–18 I had a job with the neighbor who owned a store in a large mall in Chicago. I worked every Saturday and earned minimum wage, about $20 every Saturday, they would let me off an hour early and so I could walk around the mall, one time, they offered to cash my check. I thought well surely i could spend one of my checks. So I walked around, and I found a beautiful ruffly pale pink dressy blouse, I thought would look so nice at the upcoming bible convention. And then I would be like the other girls with a new outfit, even if it was just a blouse.

I was so excited to show my mom the new blouse. She would barely turn around from the kitchen sink, she simply said….I hope it tastes good, because now we have no groceries for the week. I ran upstairs crying, I couldn’t return it to give her the money, because the mall was almost an hour away. she said that I planned that, and was more devious than she gave me credit for. I decided to wear the blouse anyway, what a nightmare day, the entire day, she made snide comments about the blouse and not having food to feed the kids. this happened a few more times, I splurged one time, and bought a new pair of shoes, and another time a skirt. they took all of my paychecks until I moved out at age 22, hundreds and thousands of dollars GONE!! And the beatings, and hits to the face continued.

Then out of the Blue, I met my Husband of 36 years. He was quirky, strong willed, and a take charge kind of guy. I tried not to get my hopes up for him, I just kept waiting for the other shoe to fall, so I kept a little distance in my feelings. Just trying to safeguard my heart. When He asked me to marry him, in the above picture, I quietly slipped the ring on my finger, but was still dreading being taken home. When I was dropped off, my wonderful Husband walked me to the door, and came in, and stated “We are Engaged”. My dad was sitting at the table with lots of Jehovah’s witness books and bibles out on the kitchen table, I started shaking right away, My dad said, “As Long as she lives in this house, she will not be marrying you!” Lee (Hubby) left the house, and didn’t really say goodbye to me at all, I am not sure why I still had the ring, as soon as he left the fighting began, and I was having another bruised cheek. And told that I was going to give that ring back. So with the bruise, I was not allowed to go to my grandmothers house the next day for a family picnic with my dads family, so no one would see the bruise.

While I was home, Lee called me and said pack your things, I am coming to get you, I rented you an apartment, and my family and sister have donated some furniture for you, and you are moving out, My dad and I are coming to get you right now. In our religion, you are not allowed to be without a chaperone at all during dating. When Lee’s dad saw my face, he had tears in his eyes, first time, I ever saw him tear up, he said in his big voice, It’s all going to be okay now. And we left the house and his dad took us to George Webb for Lunch and then moved in to a friends house for two weeks while my apartment was getting ready. then I moved into our apartment alone. Lee stayed living with his parents, and once a week, he came over with his mom as chaperone to study the family book.

We were married April 16, 1988, my dad didn’t want to come, so he held up the wedding for 30 minutes, while my uncle went to convince him to come to the kingdom hall, my father in law, at the kingdom hall, knocked on the door, and said, ten minutes, and I AM WALKING YOU DOWN THE AISLE! We had 505 people at our wedding, it was standing room only in the kingdom hall. When my dad finally showed to walk me down the aisle, he said that my dress was too low cut, and I looked like a Slut. I cried all the way down the aisle in front of 500 people, who all said Awe she is so happy.

Lee’s Dad was a big man, and when he spoke you listened, I always did. HE and I had many talks, over the years, I miss him terribly, he was a very special person to me, and really helped me to be part of who I am. I always felt so loved by him, and it was a warm and fatherly relationship, that I needed so bad. The engagement, was marred with fights, arguments, and my dad stalking me at my apartment. One night he showed up with two Jehovah’s Witness elders and had them convinced that Lee and I were in the apartment alone with no Chaperone. I had made dinner for him, my mother in law, and myself. We were reading the chapters in the Jehovah’s Witness Family Book, as directed by the elders. When they knocked on the door, Lee opened the door, and they pushed in, not noticing my mother in law in the living room, reading a book, quietly. They immediately started yelling, and accusing me and Lee of improprieties, My mother in Law who was quite boisterous, said they are not alone. I am Here!, the three of them, two elders, and my dad, just stood there. Never apologized, and left. Said they are watching us.

From that night on, my father in law said they wouldn’t dare come to his house, so come to the house and do the Family Book there. I just kept waiting for his family to convince him to kick me to the curb, that he didn’t need this kind of trouble. Lee kept all of my paychecks, to pay for the apartment and gas, and expenses. I didn’t argue at all, as I was so used to my parents taking my paychecks, But He gave me an allowance of $25 a week, to eat lunch out every day and get a Diet Coke. It was like being treated like a Princess.

We enjoyed our wedding reception and danced so much, just couldn’t believe I was married, I just was almost holding my breathe thinking that at any moment it would all go away. We went on our honeymoon to Florida. we were enjoying the theme parks, and the surroundings, when on Wednesday we came back to our hotel room to a blinking light on the room phone, message from Dad, call right away. I just instantly got ill, I thought here it is, here is the other shoe dropping, how will I go back to the parents house after this. I was in the bathroom, while Lee talked on the phone to his dad. I was so afraid to come out, Lee came and got me and said we need to talk. Lee was working for a Jehovah’s Witness Elders roofing company at the time. The elder and his whole family were at our wedding, ate the meal, stayed and danced, and I was shocked, i felt so weak in the legs, had to sit down. The elder closed his business down, and let Lee go while we were on a honeymoon and spending our money thinking we were coming home to a job. But no, he was fired. How can you go to a wedding for one of your employees, and participate, and close the doors on the Monday after the wedding, and not talk to the young man and warn him. Complete Jehovah’s Witness actions. So two faced.

My marriage to Lee was so rocky in the beginning years, I was struggling, as my mom finally brought up the letter I wrote her, and she wanted to move in with us with the youngest three kids, for us to support. Lee said no. I felt crushed, I wanted to help her, but he knew best, he was so right so many times. I also was having issues with my birth control, they switched it four times, as I was not doing well with it at all. AND So I got pregnant with our one and only little Girl Cassandra. Very rough pregnancy, lots of medical issues. Really rough birth also. But I was so happy to have our little peanut.

Since we had to switch Kingdom Halls when we got back to town after the wedding, as Lee got a new job. And I was pregnant, that is when it all started, my dad calling the elders almost every week, to get us disfellowshipped. He claimed that we must have been intimate before marriage, which was grounds to be shunned. We would go to the kingdom hall, and get called into the elders room, at least once a month, one time, I had to bring a letter from my doctor, showing my due date. To prove that we got pregnant after marriage. Our daughter was born February 24, 1989 and we were married April 16, 1988 which is 314 days, or 10 months later. You don’t carry a baby that long. The doctor would have induced me. And we kept our marriage pure, we didn’t want to get disfellowshipped. We were both afraid of being shunned from our families.

Again the families got involved with us, we didn’t know how to walk away from them all, my husbands mother hated me from day one, she wanted him to marry a different family friend. I started to build up a hard shell around me, and started lashing out at the family, and I hate to say it, but I have reacted to different situations very badly. I am not proud of some of my actions over the years. I just feel that looking back, I put up this hard shell and my softer side has vanished over the years. I was definitely RUDE to the family, and many different situations, when things were difficult, I lashed out, Now I think I did this to protect myself from anything that I wasn’t comfortable with.

You would think that would have been the end of the pregnancy mess. It clouded our one full term pregnancy. And the enjoyment we should have had with our little daughter. We would get so frustrated, that we would move to a new congregation, thinking that my family surely wouldn’t call the new congregation elders and start the accusations all over again. We moved when she was only ten months old, and it happened the first meeting we went to, the elders came up to us and asked who we were, and hauled us into the elders room, first meeting, accusing us of premarital sex again. Second meeting hauled in again, and this time, they wanted to see our marriage license and our daughters birth certificate. They scratched at it, thinking we doctored it somehow. shocking.

My family did this for the first 15 years of our marriage, every kingdom hall, every month or two, we were in the back in the elders room. With more accusations. I could hardly even listen to the speakers or participate, or even want to go at all. All the while, thinking how do I stop going to the kingdom hall without getting shunned or disfellowshipped. Lee was too afraid to make that jump either, they lord the fact that if you question them-you get disfellowshipped, if you don’t participate in all activities you are punished, if you don’t go you get phone calls from them, where were you. More guilt trip for not going, and so many times, I just wanted to hang up and say no more. the previous 22 years living at home, and first 15 years of our marriage, I didn’t see it as abuse, or fear mongering. So I suffered through it. more time lost.

But Above all else, Lee kept loving me, kept encouraging me to pull out and ahead of all the crap from my past. There was so much, I can hardly remember every little thing until a trigger pulls it out of the depths of my soul. Something simple like going to KFC, can’t do it, really bad memories. Isn’t it funny how almost 60 years old, and I am still damaged. DO you ever scream out, when will this crap in my head ever stop. I want to wake up, look outside, build new memories with my personal family.

When the 16th year of our marriage hit, we were getting exhausted, we then began dealing with a different hell, my husbands brother was physically abusing his wife, terribly, and then the police started showing up at our house in the middle of the night to arrest him, but he wasn’t at our house, we would be in the living room with our hands on our head, while they searched our home for him. I HAD HAD IT!! With the Jehovah’s witnesses, the family, everyone. But Again we moved far away to Florida. We thought, it will be better, surely.

We were doing great not going to the kingdom hall, and living our own quiet life. It was wonderful, we had decided to fall away simply and quietly. Because if you tell them you no longer want to be a Jehovah’s Witness they will disfellowship you for sure. I just wanted to fall away. So we attended and didn’t attend for many years.

Next major issue, my mother, who was famous for the guilt trips for everything. She started seeing two men. A married man and another married man. The first married man, she kissed and was seeing him without chaperones. The second Married man she got engaged to while he was still married, and he was sleeping on her couch. Still no Chaperones. And still not disfellowshipped. When she got married, she was in government housing, and you all know that means that someone cannot just move in with you, they must show their income too, but he didn’t want to disclose his income, he said it was none of their business. SO guess what they were evicted. I told her not to worry, they could come live with me, just have your new husband talk to Lee to discuss a plan, what we would all do as far as help with the expenses of having two more people in the house. And what their plans were for the future. SHE refused to have him talk to my husband, I told Lee not sure what to do, they are planning on moving in but they don’t want to talk to you at all. My Lee said Hell No, give me her number. He asked to speak to her husband, and she refused, so my husband so sick of the bullshit screamed nasty things at her, called her names, and just let it all out. I was not happy with the way it was handled, but it was handled.

So four days later, my daughter and I are up at the Walmart the only Walmart in our town, now you need to know that we live 3 hours south of my mother. We get out of the car to run in, and we see my mother walking out of Walmart with a small tote bag. My daughter is like, is that grandma? I couldn’t believe it, what is she doing in my town? We watched her walk to a white van and her husband got out when she was walking up and greeted her, then they both got in the van in the back, all darked out windows and parked in the farthest corner of the parking lot.

We watched for about a half hour, and they never moved the van, in the morning which was a Sunday, I always go to a beach that has public bathrooms and showers, and read my Sunday paper and have a McDonalds breakfast and coffee. My mother knew about it. I pull in, and guess who is parked in this small little parking area, it only holds about 15 cars, but the white van, with my mother sitting outside the van in a lawn chair. WHAT THE FREEKIN HECK!!! I missed the kingdom hall meeting that Sunday afternoon, I was so upset about this. She could go anywhere why is she in my town? Well I would found out why that afternoon.

I was at home and I got a phone call from the elders in my hall asking if they could come and talk to me and my daughter as my husband was a trucker at the time, and was out of state. Lee said to meet with them, find out what they want. So two nights later, physically ill to my stomach, from worry about what they would be coming to talk to me about. It was about my mother, that we wouldn’t let her live with us, and she was willing to forgive me for the foul language, they just needed to move in. And since Lee is gone alot, it really isn’t up to him to decide whether they move in or not.

WHAT THE FREEKIN HECK! I explained to the elders from the kingdom hall that my husband is still the head of our house, whether he works out of the house or not, correct, they agreed. Then they asked if my mother and her husband could move in. I said absolutely, they are welcome to come move in, her husband needs to call my husband, and discuss how we will handle finances, and what is the exit plan, if you need a year two years five years, lets discuss this, and if things change, then we will discuss again. That is all. The elders thought that was reasonable, and they politely told me that I should try to get this resolved, as they were telling people in the kingdom hall what my husband said to her. Bad mouthing us both to any who would listen.

Well needless to say, we were done with our lease, and we left our kingdom hall again where we were making friends, and disappeared again. We moved another hour south, but still the rumors flew, and eventually reached us down south, and it was such a twisted story by then. So hurtful. How we caused them to be homeless, and we just wouldn’t even help. We were ungrateful children, granted, I am in my 40’s now. We finally talked about just leaving all together.

WE had about three more run inns with the elders, in the next five years, then finally said ENOUGH!!! Our daughter married a man who was a Baptist, and moved all the way up to Northern Michigan on Lake Superior, almost 23 hours away. We then started putting our plan in place to sell our home, and move north away from all family and friends, and cut everyone off of our social media, and change our phones, we knew that we were cutting off everything. But the weekly, monthly and yearly pain was going to end forever. In the middle of all of these difficult times, we started taking time to read our bible on our own, without the influence of the Jehovah’s Witness books, and spin on every scripture. They have and do twist many scriptures to keep the control on the parishioners. We started learning about our lord and savior Yeshua (Jesus) and his father Yahhua Elohim (Jehovah God). We felt that at the heart of all the teachings are some very basic commandments that are carried throughout. One was to know his name as it will save you. So calling him by any other name seemed slenderness to us. Since our names in English do not change in other countries, I am still Carrie no matter what the local language is. So we want to use their names in original Hebrew. Since we have these thoughts, we are now labeled Apostate and should be shunned.

My husband has preserved us, we left Jehovah’s Witnesses about two years ago, and we blocked all family members too, I am the oldest of Seven Children, I only talk to my youngest brother, and I am cautious with him, I need some family. We have stopped all communication with Lee’s family over the years for so many reasons, Lee continues to be my Hero, he loves me, unconditionally, and he finds reasoning with me and talking to me to work well. When you come at me head on, it seems to close me down, I try not to, but I think it is part of my preservation. I am loving who we are right now.

We moved far away from anyone that we know, and we only do things with our daughter and son in law, and sometimes with our son in laws mother and father too. We have a small circle of friends, three neighbors we are semi close with. So lets dive into some thoughts on how to over come a rough childhood, and a rough growing up time.

I look forward to showing you some really neat knowledge. So follow me for more things. I promise this is the last you will hear about my past. Coping is so much more important once you come out of an abusive past that took me 57 years to leave behind.

1i2wi51,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1i2wi51/one_only_cape_town_review_january_2025/,One & Only Cape Town Review | January 2025,"Hey friends, excited to get back into posting more reviews in 2025 as our travel ramps back up post-holidays!

Writing this post from the balcony of my room at The Palms in Turks & Caicos which is an amazing boutique, beach front property here that's just been fully renovated as of December. I'll actually be doing an AMA with the GM, Jeff tomorrow - so keep your eyes peeled for that. And I'll drop a full review later as well. I have been absolutely blown away by the beauty of the property and the care and $ put into these reno's. It's stunning and should be on your list for Caribbean stays. Plus the rates are really reasonable.

Ok now back to the O&O review...

Full disclosure, this stay was done by a wonderful member of my team named Sarah. Not to be confused with u/sarahwlee, who in fact has a member on her team named Alex (different Alex than me) - so it's really just quite a mess and we may need to rename everyone here soon lol.

My last visit to OO Cape Town was in 2022 so it's been a minute and I was thrilled to get Sarah in for an updated stay. As I aim to visit more properties more often - I can't physically get to all of them. I will have members of my team going one place while I go to another, bringing you reviews from all over the world at once :). Sarah was around South Africa the past week+ scoping out spots and I'll be in Turks & Caicos for the long weekend going to visit: The Palms, Amanyara & Grace Bay Club. After that I'll be heading to Bora Bora for Four Seasons Bora Bora & The Brando in a couple weeks.

**Where we went**: One & Only Cape Town

**When we went**: January 2025

**Who went**: Couple (Sarah & her husband)

**Room type**: Marina Table Mountain Room

**Overview**: One & Only Cape Town is a property for those looking to bop around in the mix of the city while still having a luxurious retreat at the end of the day. Historically I've promoted Ellerman House (also stayed on this trip, review coming soon), tbh it's still my favorite. I love the picturesque cliffside location and understated vibe when you drive up, not knowing that just beyond the gates is this spectacular, perfectly renovated yet authentic, ultra-private mansion. Plus I'm a REAL sucker for the snack room - last time I was there I skipped two meals in favor of the snacks. However, in 2025 I'm trying to expand my repertoire because obviously there are many great hotels in CT and some people do want to be in the city. And so that is how Sarah's visit to O&O CT came to be! PS - we are still working on our photo taking skills so mixed in here are some of Sarah's pics and some from Kerzer. I'll label where relevant. The really profesh photo's are Kerzer's lol.

**Property**: 9/10  
*Fully renovated starting in 2022*

Forming the backbone of the property is the Marine Rise building. With 91 rooms & suites along with the main entrance, lobby and restaurants, this is the central hub of the property. While the exterior of the building is fairly unremarkable, once you walk into the main lobby, the majesty of Table Mountain overwhelms you as you take it in through enormous floor to ceiling glass windows. As the mountain rises beyond the grounds of the property, any fleeting thought of the lackluster exterior is long gone. This natural wonder of Cape Town is truly breathtaking. I’ll say, this is where O&O has Ellerman House beat. 

[Pre-reno](https://preview.redd.it/k2hr2iiklede1.jpg?width=3500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5ce2a858ec3a36f67316db24accde9f477f6832)

[Post-reno, Kerzer photo](https://preview.redd.it/sff7r3bmlede1.png?width=2116&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f37c1c6c69cfba759f343f85d2d5f96e097ed3f)

In front of the Table Mountain view is the circular lobby bar which has a beautiful sculpture by the artist, Trzebinski. This sculpture depicts the local legend, ""The Watchers."" According to the legend, Table Mountain is one of four Watchers, giants of natural form created by Mother Earth to protect the land from the Great Sea Dragon. The view of this sculpture with the mountain behind is really quite special.

[Kerzer photo](https://preview.redd.it/na38x6anlede1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=106473a03e382d2217a156f0f476fadd97f76250)

Beyond the lobby lies your first glimpse of the manmade islands of the property. These islands are One & Only's way of bringing local nature back into the resort. As many of you may know, central to O&O's design ethos is creating a sense of place that is not only culturally relevant, but just as important, provides a tribute to the natural environment of the destination. While this property is in the midst of the city, they have brought elements of the original nature back through these islands. The lush, over planted land feels more like a garden oasis than a hotel. As soon as you step foot outside Marine Rise you can hear the call of birds unlike anything you're used to in a city property.

[Sarah photo](https://preview.redd.it/ymaw6n5qlede1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dda405ba1dff6b0524fb4d4fe60fe598ffc5f72b)

[Kerzer photo, obviously lol](https://preview.redd.it/i80533aulede1.png?width=2254&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4b751283eba1e12d05f7c4a9decb033c100f81f)

While the Marine Rise building may feel more like a city hotel, the islands are where everything changes. As you head toward them, you are enveloped by near forest cover - and it's with this that you're able to forget, if only briefly, that you're in the middle of a bustling city. The islands are home to the spa, pool and 41 rooms. The infinity pool is a highlight and since it's heated, it can be enjoyed year round.

https://preview.redd.it/0p32pn4plede1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c79abc469139857b9d4c31e62bcd108c6597b674

The reason I'm giving the property an 8.5 not a 10 is twofold

1. While the islands are lush and beautiful, I do feel parts of the exterior to the Marina Rise building feels starkly less lush and so some of the beauty and integration is lost there.
2. In my experience, One & Only is uniquely successful at integrating the local aesthetic and art into their design ethos to create a property that feels authentic while maintaining the calm and chic One & Only retreat experience. But for some reason, certain pieces of the common spaces within the Marina Rise building doesn’t execute this as flawlessly as some other properties and feels a bit frenetic. I don’t pretend to be a design critic, and if you saw the interior of my home you’d be appalled, but it’s something about the mix of colors, patterns and materials that doesn’t feel as serene and elegant as many of the other OO properties. Locations like OO Mandarina and OO Gorilla's Nest are able to imbibe the local aesthetic and blend it with their unique design eye to create a soothing and chic yet entirely authentic sense of place. I just don’t feel that with OO Cape Town. 

**Rooms**: 8.5/10

[Sarah photo](https://preview.redd.it/qoi3ocs1mede1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=437b0ce7e561d0ed14d2adacf229b89098ebe363)

The property was completely renovated in 2022 - all 132 rooms were renovated. 91 of those rooms are in the Marina Rise building and 41 are on the island. The Marina Rise rooms were designed based on the raw beauty of the mountain, with earthy tones and textures.

The island rooms are all designed based on the ocean - so more blues. They have a view of the water surrounding the island and some have a view of the Marina Rise building. While the island rooms are entirely relaxing and tranquil, in terms of views, you don't see much of Cape Town so you really could be anywhere. Whereas the Marina Rise building offers those sweeping views of Table Mountain.

The rooms are well sized for a city hotel. Like many OO's the layouts are great and use the space well. A large number of rooms don't have great views so that's why the lower rating.

**Service**: 7.5/10

* This is where things aren't as great.
* While all the staff are very friendly, welcoming, and there was amazing service everywhere we went  within the hotel, there were some hiccups on the service side of things to be aware of.
* The room cleaning and service seemed to be a bit clunky at times
   * A garbage bag was left in the room after the attendants came on the first day. Sarah moved it out of the way by the door to be taken the next time they came but it was left again.
   * There was a big ring mark (the size of a dinner plate) on top of the coffee counter that was sticky when they arrived , so it hadn’t been cleaned / wiped down from previous guests
   * They had 2 occasions where the do not disturb sign was on, but they rang the doorbell for the room - one of the occasions it was for a delivery but was for the wrong room, and the  second time they rang twice before leaving (we think it could have been for turn down  service, but the do not disturb was on).
   * With the cleaning and do not disturb sign issues, it did feel slightly clunky in service, but the staff  were so nice and helpful when you needed something. Would just be aware of it, and let guests  know what to expect.

**Food & Restaurants**: 

* **Rooi** \- just completed the renovations. This is where breakfast will be served in the mornings. Incredible view of table mountain, especially for the outdoor seating.  Breakfast is a full buffet daily from 6:30-11am. Rooi also offers dinner - more focused on South African cuisine cooked by fire.
* **Nobu** \- the only Nobu in Southern Africa. Recommend booking a table in advance, but  they do try to keep a few tables each night for in-house walk-ins.
* **Isola** \- Mediterranean poolside restaurant available daily during summer months. It is  generally closed from around May-October each year. During winter months, the in-room  dining can be ordered from the pool.
* **Vista bar & lounge** \- Amazing views in the heart of the hotel. A great place to go for a  drink or cocktail, they do offer meals as well. They have a popular afternoon tea from  2-5pm each day, recommended to be booked in advance. There is a live pianist during  the afternoon tea times daily, and live music in the lounge every evening.

**Extras & activities**: 

* Like all OO's, they work hard to provide a great Kids Club with dynamic programming",2,1737054247.0,chubbytravel,0,0.75,False

If you're looking to enhance your kitchen while saving both time and space, focusing on small home appliances is the way to go. These compact devices can efficiently perform tasks that typically take longer with traditional cooking methods. Let’s explore some of the best small kitchen appliances that will not only maximize your kitchen efficiency but also free up much-needed space.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/small-home-appliances-kitchen  
  
### Multi-Cookers

A multi-cooker is a must-have in any modern kitchen. This gadget combines several cooking functions into one device, such as pressure cooking, slow cooking, sautéing, and steaming. With a multi-cooker, you can whip up a hearty meal in a fraction of the time it would take on the stovetop. Plus, because it consolidates several appliances into one, it saves valuable countertop space.

### Compact Food Processors

Food processors make kitchen prep a breeze, but larger models can take up a significant amount of room. Opt for a compact food processor that retains essential features while fitting seamlessly in your cabinet. With this appliance, you can chop, slice, shred, and mix ingredients in no time—perfect for those who enjoy cooking but want to minimize effort and mess.

These kettles come with variable temperature settings, so you can have the perfect cup of tea or coffee every time. Many models also feature automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection, making them both safe and convenient.

### Immersion Blenders

When it comes to blending soups and sauces, an immersion blender is especially handy. This compact device allows you to blend ingredients right in the pot, which cuts down on washing multiple bowls.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/small-home-appliances-kitchen

If you're a coffee enthusiast, consider a compact coffee maker that fits your limited counter space but still brews a fantastic cup. Single-serve machines take up less space and prevent wasting coffee. Look for a machine with a built-in grinder for the freshest brew possible right at home.

### Blenders

Investing in a high-quality blender can elevate your kitchen game. Look for a model that is powerful yet compact. A blender is essential for making smoothies, sauces, and soups. Some even come with personal blending cups, making it easy to whip a quick breakfast on the go without using multiple dishes.

1i2wfnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestCooker/comments/1i2wfnf/best_way_cook_beef_ribs/,Best Way Cook Beef Ribs,"The Best Way to Cook Beef Ribs: Techniques and Tips
---------------------------------------------------

Cooking beef ribs is a delightful culinary experience that can yield mouth-watering results when done right. Whether you’re grilling, smoking, or braising, the technique you choose will significantly impact the flavor and tenderness of the meat. Here, we explore some of the best ways to cook beef ribs and share some tips to help you create heaping plates of tender, juicy goodness.

### Choosing the Right Cut

Before you dive into cooking, selecting the right cut of beef ribs is essential. Here are the most popular options:

- **Back Ribs:** These are smaller, leaner ribs cut from the cow's upper back, and they typically have less meat.
- **Short Ribs:** This cut is thicker and has more meat marbled with fat, making it perfect for slow-cooking methods.
- **Plate Ribs:** This larger cut offers more meat and is ideal for barbecuing or smoking.

### Seasoning Your Ribs

Seasoning is key to unlocking the flavor in beef ribs. You can opt for a simple salt and pepper rub, or choose to create a more complex blend. Try this easy seasoning mix:

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-cook-beef-ribs  
  
- 2 tablespoons of kosher salt
- 1 tablespoon of black pepper
- 1 tablespoon of garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon of onion powder
- 1 tablespoon of smoked paprika

Keep it simple or get creative with your favorite herbs and spices. Allow the rub to rest on the ribs for at least an hour before cooking to enhance the flavors.

### The Best Cooking Techniques

#### Grilling

Grilling is a popular method that adds a beautiful char to beef ribs. Here’s how you can do it:

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-cook-beef-ribs  
  
1. Preheat your grill to medium heat.
2. Cook the ribs over indirect heat, which means placing them away from the flames.
3. Cover the grill and let the ribs cook for about 3 to 4 hours, monitoring the temperature.

This method gives the ribs a smoky flavor and a caramelized finish. Baste with barbecue sauce during the last 30 minutes for extra flavor.

#### Smoking

If you want to take your beef ribs to the next level, smoking is an excellent choice. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-cook-beef-ribs  
  
1. Preheat your smoker to 225°F (107°C).
2. Add wood chips of your choice—hickory, mesquite, or applewood work well.
3. Place your seasoned ribs on the smoker rack, bone side down.
4. Smoke the ribs for about 6 hours or until they reach an internal temperature of 205°F (96°C).

Smoking creates delightful flavors and tender meat that falls off the bone.

#### Braising

Braising is another fantastic method for cooking beef ribs, especially when you want a dish that’s rich and comforting. For this method, follow these steps:

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-cook-beef-ribs  
  
1. Brown the beef ribs in a large pot on medium-high heat.
2. Add aromatics like onions, garlic, and herbs of your choice.
3. Pour in beef broth or wine and bring it to a simmer.
4. Cover and let it cook on low heat for about 3 hours or until tender.

This slow-moist cooking method infuses the meat with flavor and results in incredibly juicy ribs.

### Finishing Touches

Regardless of cooking method, the finishing touches can elevate your beef ribs:

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-cook-beef-ribs  
  
- Rest the ribs for 10-15 minutes after cooking to allow the juices to redistribute.
- Drizzle some sauce on top before serving, or offer it on the side.
- Pair with classic sides like coleslaw, cornbread, or baked beans for a true comfort meal.

With these techniques and tips, you have all the tools needed to prepare delicious beef ribs. Experiment with different methods and seasonings to discover your personal favorites. Enjoy the process, and most importantly, savor every bite!

Flavor Enhancements for Beef Ribs: Marinades and Seasonings
-----------------------------------------------------------

Cooking beef ribs can be an art, and one of the most vital aspects of mastering this dish is the use of marinades and seasonings. These enhancements can bring out the rich flavors of the meat, making each bite tender and mouthwatering. When you think about the best way to cook beef ribs, remember that the right marinade or seasoning can turn an ordinary meal into a culinary masterpiece.

Choosing the right marinade is essential. Marinades help to tenderize the meat while infusing it with flavor. Here’s a short list of popular marinades for beef ribs:

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-cook-beef-ribs  
  
- **Balsamic Vinegar Marinade:** Mix balsamic vinegar, olive oil, garlic, and rosemary for a robust flavor.
- **Asian-Style Marinade:** Combine soy sauce, ginger, sesame oil, and brown sugar for a sweet and savory touch.
- **Spicy BBQ Marinade:** Use a mix of hot sauce, apple cider vinegar, and honey for a kick of heat.
- **Beer Marinade:** Incorporate dark beer, mustard, and brown sugar for a deep, rich flavor.

To effectively use these marinades, you should marinate your beef ribs for at least 4 hours, but overnight is best. The longer the meat sits in the marinade, the more flavor it absorbs. Just remember to keep it in the refrigerator during the marinating process to ensure food safety.

Besides marinades, seasoning plays a crucial role in enhancing the flavor of beef ribs. A simple seasoning blend can transform your dish from bland to spectacular. Here are some essential seasonings to consider:

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-cook-beef-ribs  
  
- **Salt and Pepper:** Simple yet effective. A generous sprinkle can amplify the meat's natural flavors.
- **Garlic Powder:** This adds depth and a savory kick.
- **Onion Powder:** Enhances the sweet and savory profile of the dish.
- **Smoked Paprika:** Offers a smoky flavor that’s perfect for BBQ lovers.
- **Cayenne Pepper:** For those who enjoy some heat, this spice does the job.

You can tailor your spices according to your preference. For example, trying a coffee rub when grilling beef ribs can give it a bold, unique flavor. Just mix ground coffee with a bit of brown sugar, salt, and pepper, then rub it generously onto the ribs before cooking. This method creates a beautifully caramelized crust.

Dry rubs are another excellent way to season beef ribs. This technique involves mixing various spices together and then applying them directly to the meat before cooking. A great dry rub could include:

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-cook-beef-ribs  
  
- Two tablespoons of brown sugar
- One tablespoon of chili powder
- One tablespoon of paprika
- One teaspoon of garlic powder
- One teaspoon of onion powder
- Salt and pepper to taste

Apply the rub to the ribs, ensuring that it covers the entire surface. For the best results, let the ribs sit for at least one hour or longer if time allows. This gives the spices time to penetrate the meat fibers.

When cooking beef ribs, remember that the method used will also affect the final flavor and tenderness. If you're grilling, you might want to use a direct heat method for searing, followed by indirect heat to slowly cook them through. If you choose to use the oven or a slow cooker, low and slow is the name of the game; typically, aim for a temperature around 225°F. Cooking it slowly allows the spices and marinade to meld into the meat, creating an unforgettable flavor experience.

Check The Details Here: https://itrendworld.com/best-way-cook-beef-ribs  
  
Pairing your flavored beef ribs with sides is a smart way to complete your meal. Think coleslaw, baked beans, or cornbread to complement the meaty goodness. These sides can balance the rich flavors and enhance your dining experience.

Using marinades and seasonings effectively makes all the difference when cooking beef ribs. The flavor enhancements you choose will depend on personal preferences, but the right combination is sure to elevate your dish. Enjoy experimenting and savor the delicious results!

Send me a DM who's interested, and we'll talk on telegram for more comfort so we can get together. 

I say telegram since there is no need to give a phone number if you do not want to since this is more comfortable for both, however if we get to organize a meeting by DM of reddit and see you in person we can share number to talk on WhatsApp if we both agree.

( Fructose intolerance),"So 2 years ago I had extrem symptoms. Severe constipation, gastritis, hot flashes during the night that wouldn't let me sleep more than 2 hours and much more. I was also super bloated. I even had coffee black stool which was blood, heartburn and silent reflux.

Colonoscopy all good, endoscopy all good, no celiac, no diabetes.

For months doctors told me it's just in my head and hidden gas in the lower abdominal. Then I changed one more time and the doctor found out that I have EPI, my pancreas doesn't produce enough enzymes it was scary low 16. 

2 MRIs showed that my pancreas is perfectly fine tho. I started to take creon, enzymes. Started feeling better overnight heartburn, silent reflux basically gone over night.

Since my bowel movements were all over the place but at least no more blood.

After months of waiting I got into a special hospital and they suspect Fructose intolerance or sibo but gotta wait another 3 months for the testing.

She suggested to try out a low FODMAP and cut out sugar and Fructose. For the first time in 2 years I woke up with a fairly flat stomach, after eating I get a belly not sure if it's normal or bloated but it gets way flatter after a couple of hours.

I feel better. Now I wonder if it was the entire time Fructose intolerance instead of sibo? Which probably inflamed my system. 

Since I'm on this diet I feel extremely thirsty especially during the night. I think about supplementing with electrolytes. 

I was wondering tho if maybe the overgrowth is now acting up. Yesterday I tried to have some coconut water which has a little bit of sugar. I immediately had hot flashes during the night which I didn't had for days since on this diet.

Heartbroken and freshly 18 I decided to sign up for Tinder, worst mistake of my life. For two months I flopped back and forth in other men's beds, hoping it would help my aching heart. Eventually, during early fall I was swiping on Tinder and saw this 27 year old; his name was Wells, he was white, blonde, bearded, and had glasses. I decided to give him a chance, someone else to add to my roster of ever growing people. Although differently on his profile I noticed he went to the same college my sister attended to, I frequented there alot with my sister. So on a random afternoon I ask him to come out and see me on campus. My first time meeting him I didn't even want to walk up to him, it was so weird meeting a person in a large social setting(cafeteria). Eventually we sit and we start a conversation about a variety of topics. School, work, and our own personal lives which for once didn't feel like a chore to get into someone's pants. I loved our continuous conversation, he was intelligent and quick witted. Eventually some time passes and we go out again just for coffee. And some part of me starts liking Wells, more than just a body more than what I summed up older guys to be. Well's 28 birthday rolls around and I end up taking him out lunch. It was the most intimate thing I've done with another person, even though my sister was there. Although we became more intimate, ""sleeping"" in his car together after his classes and mine. This continued for a month till, one day in his car I ask him if he would ever date me. Breaking the news he said no, he told me I am a sweet girl but I am just not up to his standards. Sobbing in his passenger seat stuffing my feelings down I told him that's okay and, that we will just stay friends with benefits. As another month passes we grew closer, walking around the colleges(we go to separate colleges) holding hands and kissing. Sometimes he would put his hand on the small of my back. I adored this attention because, not only did I have his full undivided attention I felt loved. Wells would open doors for me and never let me pay, some days he would just listen to me rant. He even encouraged me to go to therapy, we shared such intimate times together. One day I went over his house and we showered together. Another time I had a breakdown during a class and he came driving to my aid to hold me while I cried in his car my the lake, later that day I took a nap in his bed. Wells was my entire world and for three months he felt like a boyfriend to me. People would alwas assume we were a couple in public because, of how we acted with one another. Not only that gentle love, he gave me amazing sex, although he wanted me to call myself racial slurs(I am asian). It turned him on, made him happy snd if he was happy so was I. Though things started to turn sour during October. One night my sister decided to rent an Airbnb, I invited Wells over to stay and come with my sister and I including her friends to the club. I got absolutely hammered that night and was all over him at the club. Making sure I flashed my bright pink thong to him under my black mini skirt. When we arrived home we immediately got ""busy"" I was extremely drunk and cannot remember that night. But, I do remember he wanted to have sex around 5 am before he went to work. Later that morning I woke up with him gone to work and me with a raging headache. I went to use the bathroom and notice my thong really wet, it wasn't just from my period which I was on for only three days. Two days later my period ends earlier than expected and I thought nothing of it. Weeks go by I still see Wells regularly for sex, but we made boundaries to not hold hands in school anymore to rebuke and allegations of us dating. During those weeks I get extreme cramps, my boobs start to enlarge, and I start eating alot. This made me assume I was just gaining weight from the food I ate so I started to eat less. Though this didn't stop me from drinking, vaping, and partying. Eventually me and Wells stop sex for a week so I could test if I was pregnant because it's already been past October since I had my last period. Low and behold on a Saturday morning the test comes back positive. I cry on the toilet while my sister consoles me, later I end up calling Wells crying between my words. We never used a condom and always pulled out,  I was scared of birth control changing my hormones so I never got on it. We knew this was dangerous so in the end we always opted for an abortion if the worst was to happen, and it did. Two days pass and I go see him to make plans for an abortion the next week. The week of the abortion comes up and he comes with me, luckily the nurses told us that it was still early only a clump of cells 6 centimeters. Our nurse says it was conceived on October 6 or 7, that was the night we went to the club. We stare at we eachother for a second as the nurse leaves but, before leaving she hands me my ultrasound. A photo of a  small sac with 6 centimeters of cells, a fetus. The nurse comes back in hands me the abortion pills and sends us on our way home. Wells takes me to my favorite bakery allowing me to pick out any pasteerie I want. In that moment I felt like I had a family, his hand in mine and a baby who wasn't gone yet. He held me and spun me around I the bakery, for that one second I felt like I was really his. We eat then start out drive home, the next few days are grueling for me. I am having horrible cramps extreme pain and on the Friday of that week I start vomiting purfusly(a side effect of the abortion). Later that night I call Wells and I hear a soft giggle in the back. I think nothing of it and brush it off as he says he is busy and he will call me later, he never did. The next few days he is distant, no late night calls and hardly any texting. On our way to our check up appointment the next week, he tells me he has met someone. I started to cry uncontrollably, he proceeds to tell me she is dating someone. He told me they met through his best friend and that they went out that day to just to hang out. Towards the night they got drunk and ended up in his back seat making out, it was the same night I called him. As Wells tells me all of this I am sobbing and asking him why not me. I ask about her and why he likes her, he says he knows what she wants, they like the same music, and their conversations and never dull of unintelligent. He pulls over the car to an empty parking lot, I immediately bolt out of the car and lean on it sobbing holding my stomach. He gets out and walks to me offering me a hug and I yell at him to stay the fuck away from me. After as soon as this happens a guy in a car passing by tells him to make sure he treating me good. Him and I stand in silence as the sniffle and wipe my tears. I wonder why couldn't it be me, his pregnant teenage friends with benefits. While we are almost there I take a nap from he exhaustion of my fit of rage. After an hour we go inside as we wait I hold his hand and dig my nails into him, squeezing his hand in anger. Once they call us and we sit down with the nurses they examine me again. Showing me my ultrasound they say I passed the baby. I stare at Wells empty, on our way back home I am continually crying and quiet. Crashing out in a In In Out parking lot in the back of his car. Begging and pleading to him why couldn't he love me just the same as her. Later two weeks go by, dry texts no calls I made a decsion to cut him off officially. We have tried to before but always came back together but now I knew he would never be mine, I cut it off in a letter. Blocking his contact but still showing up to the school hoping he would look for me. I hoped he would reach out to me holding me in his arms again apologizing for hurting me. He never did. I contact him right before December starts and tell him how much he hurt me. Everything he did with that girl and the distancing, I am crying at the airport on call with him. I ask him if he kept seeing her and he said yes, she kept cheating on her boyfriend . She eventually told him and he still took her back. During my trip to ease my pain I started to drink everyday, and every day I drank I texted him. How I am better than him, I am getting over him, and that he was nothing to me all lies. The day I come home I call him, apologizing to him and asking about the updates of his life. Wells proceeds to tell me he is still seeing her and in a fit of rage I yell at him. Telling him how could he do this to another person that just wasn't me but someone he doesn't even know(the girl's boyfriend). I tell him about my experience cheating back in middle school to highschool. I told him no matter what me and that guy always got together even during covid. Stunned by what I had to say about his actions he hardly said anything. We didn't talk till new years when I reached out to him. He responded then a week passed I contacted him again no response, I contacted him again and he responded. We decided to meet up for coffee. We see eachother and silence, I couldn't look at him. It broke me to see him to talk to him, I couldn't even hold him anymore for his comfort. We went into his car because is started to cry again. It felt weird being in his passenger seat again, we talked for a long time. I told him how much he hurt me the people around me and people he doesn't even know. All he could do was apologize, we ended leaving the parking lot to walk around stores. And in a Barnes and Nobles I being to start crashing I tell him how immature he is, how he groomed me to be perfect for him through his actions of affection. And how the girl he is talking to is too young for him she is 22. We end up in the back parking lot, I cry again. Telling him how someone else now has to clean up his mess he decided to run away from. How no one will hold him responsible for what he did but congratulate him, because he helped me get the abortion. As for me I am stuck labeled forever as a teenager with an abortion a harlot, nothing more than his whore. Yet after all I said to him all he could do was apologize to me and I still accepted it, I still forgave him. Driving me back to my car we sat in silence and is that parking lot I cried to him to stay. He kept leaving and walking away form me because he knew it hurt me to be in his life. I told him it hurt more when he wasn't in it, when he didn't say anything to me. I had no one to turn to, I felt abandoned by him. Even though we never dated my feelings for him lingered, I loved him. Wells ended the conversation with a compromise that he will stay but with limited interaction. And holding on to anything I accepted. He walked to my car and I asked him for a hug. I cried in his arms clutching him while I shaking. His hug felt so lifeless and cold, nothing like when he used to hold me. Eventually I texted him and he hardly said anything. To stop myself from the yearning of him, I told him that if he wished to talk to me he had to first. And if he wanted my forgiveness he would have to change who he is and really show me that change. I'll never forget him, he was the father of my aborted child who I still love dearly. My actions play a part in all of this too.

I went today before my class to use a gift card and, at first, I saw a long line. I thought ""ah the line's usually long and I still have time"" so I decided to wait in the line. After about five minutes the line wasn't moving at all so I decided to just mobile order, thinking it would take less time for me to get my order. 

But oh no. I find myself waiting twenty minutes for my order (it was kind of busy). My order? A brownie and an iced coffee? Even if its busy, something as simple as that shouldn't take twenty minutes. 

After the twenty minutes, my order STILL didn't come and so I went to the person at the mobile order station and asked ""hey where's my order? I placed it twenty minutes ago and it still didn't come."" Turns out the receipt was way below everyone elses even though it shouldn't be as hard as anything else to make in the store. 

This isn't the first time I've experienced awful service at this tims. Several times before, the workers there don't even take orders for a good five minutes at a time. In five minutes, I could be in and out of the Rideau Centre Tims. Like what's the deal?

I know this for sure: if I was running the CRX Tim's, this wouldn't be a problem.

I’m the father of my 7-year-old son/daughter—a brilliant but mischievous kid. Recently, I was called to the principal’s office because my child decided to rip up another student’s book. After a stern discussion with the principal, I was directed to visit the class teacher’s room for further guidance.

I knocked on her door, and a soft, sweet voice answered, “Yes, please, come in.” I stepped inside with my child, taking a seat at her desk. The moment I saw her, my attention shifted. She was wearing a traditional saree, draped elegantly, and her natural charm was impossible to ignore. Her warm smile and graceful demeanor made it difficult to focus on the reason I was there.

As she began discussing my child’s results and behavior, I found myself less interested in the report card and more captivated by her. It was as if the world slowed down. Then, almost unexpectedly, she looked at me and asked, “Would you like to meet for coffee?”

Her words caught me off guard, but I quickly replied, “Yes, please,” without hesitation.

What could she possibly want to discuss over coffee? Was it about my child—or something more? I couldn’t wait to find out.

I’d like to introduce you to the Yonder Credit Card, which is currently offering 10,000 free points when you sign up through a referral. Here’s a brief overview of its features:

* App-based: Get a virtual card instantly and start using it with Apple Pay right after signing up.
* Earn up to 5 points per £ spent with the card.
* No foreign transaction fees when used abroad (it’s a Mastercard).
* Receive 10,000 points immediately upon signing up through a referral, plus free travel insurance for a limited time.
* Points can be redeemed for various experiences in London, such as dining, coffee shops, shows, and fitness classes.
* Experiences are updated monthly and are easily accessible through the app.
* Redeeming points is straightforward: pay with your card, request to use points within the app, and Yonder will credit your balance.

I've used this card on several city breaks recently, and it’s been fantastic. No fees, app notifications similar to Monzo, and you benefit from the Mastercard exchange rate.

Signing up is quick and takes about 5 minutes. The app’s KYC process is swift, and you’ll have your virtual card ready to use right away (the app is very user-friendly).

Use my referral link to sign up and get the 10,000 points, plus three months free of their Premium plan (normally £15 per month). With this plan, you'll earn 5 points per £ spent and enjoy free family travel insurance. Just remember to downgrade to the free plan before the three months end (you can do this via live chat in the app). The free plan is similar, except for the travel insurance, and you'll earn 1 point per £1 spent, which is still worthwhile.

If you sign up using my link, I'll also get 10,000 points, so it’s a win-win!

We went through a really rough patch at the end of 2023 and we ended up living separately for a bit to have some space. During that time a girl reached out to me with screenshots of my boyfriend snap chatting her (which he never really uses).
Complimenting her, calling her sexy, beautiful, etc and asking to go for coffee. Long story short nothing happened with that because she did research on him and found out about me within a few hours and messaged me that same day. We were able to move past it and since then have had a wonderful relationship. 

I do suffer with a few mental health issues, one of those being BPD which I have been able to manage but still does mean that things hurt me and stick with me alot more as I try to manage my illness and recover from the bit of relationship trauma he has caused. It's now been just over a year since this has happened and like I said, we've been doing so well, he has done alot of work on himself to learn how to treat me and better our relationship (so have I but that's besides the point).

 At times I still have moments where I question him on things, because my anxiety is on an all time high as I haven't learned to fully trust him again since that happened, I'm always scared and I think about what happened every day of my life because I am with him every day and i'm reminded of it. But every time I bring something up that I just want reassurance for he shuts me down. I'll give you the example of what happened with us this morning while he was getting ready for work; So l've bee hearing a random buzzing noise for a few weeks now, it sounds like an iPhone text tone buzz and sounds like it's coming from under the bed on his side whether he is home or not. I convinced myself I was going crazy until it happens this morning and I asked him if he heard it and he said he did. 

I calmly said ""you're not hiding another phone from me right?"" and he just laughed and said no. So I said ""okay, but you laughing is making me more anxious, I get worried about you and there's times I still don't trust you"" he then proceeds to keep brushing me off, telling me I have nothing to worry about in a extremely annoyed voice, when I pointed it out he said ""of course i'm annoyed, you don't trust me and ask me over and over again, i've already told you there's nothing"". I explained that I ask over and over because I have every right to not trust him and when I do ask he can't give me the time of day to sit down and properly reassure me from a place of love, he always just shrugs me off and doesn't make me feel very good. 

Every time I bring up his tone of voice and how it's condescending and rude he goes ""i'm not doing that, idk where you're getting this from all I said is i'm not hiding shit"". I just feel that there's a much nicer way to say things and he's making me feel like i'm the annoyance when I didn't cause this situation in the first place, he gave me the distrust, he is the one who was planning on cheating on me, I think I have every right to question him on things like this. He then proceeded to tell me that I should be ""over it by now"" and that it's pathetic i'm not, he said this all while chuckling. I got more upset especially when I believe I have every right to not be over it, it's only been a year, we have had no counselling and every time I try and bring anything up to talk about it and try and work through it, this is how he responds to me every time. How am I supposed to get over something when my partner shuts me down and makes me feel like i'm the problem, I didn't cause these issues in the first place, he did, l just want his support as I try to navigate through the pain I feel from this daily.

Long story short, is it valid to be looking for the reassurance that he's failing to provide? And if so can someone please explain how we can go from here, l want to go through any replies I get on here with him later, although I bet he doesn't care, because I should just be over it by now, and when I bring it up later I'm sure he'll just continue scrolling on his phone and barely give me the time of day, because 'HE is over it' and so should I.

TL;DR!
My boyfriend won’t give me proper reassurance after him cheating on me because he is annoyed that I’m always asking for it as he believes I should be over it by now. ",0,1737052706.0,relationships,6,0.33,False

I’m a 4th-year computer engineering major, and I recently landed a coffee chat with a recruiter from one of my dream companies! I was the one who initiated the invite, and to my surprise, he agreed. Now, I’m trying to figure out the best way to navigate this conversation so that it potentially leads to an actual job opportunity at the company.

Since I initiated the meeting, I’m assuming I’ll need to guide the flow of the conversation. I’d really appreciate any advice or tips on how to handle this chat, as I’m feeling a bit anxious about the opportunity and don’t want to mess it up.

Specifically, I’m wondering:

1. What kind of questions would be appropriate to ask a recruiter during a coffee chat?
2. How can I subtly show my interest and fit for the company without coming off as overly pushy or desperate?
3. Is it okay to touch on technical topics, or should I keep the discussion more general? (I’m genuinely interested in some of the company’s technical work, but I don’t know how much a recruiter would know about that.)
4. Any tips for leaving a lasting positive impression?

I want to strike the right balance between being professional, showing genuine interest, and making it clear that I’d love to work at the company. If anyone has been in a similar situation or has any insights, I’d love to hear your advice.

34F - I’m new to online dating in 2025.

My ex and I met on Tinder in 2018 and broke up in 2024. When we first connected, he chatted with me consistently on Tinder for 2-4 weeks before asking me out for coffee.

The two guys I matched and met with also talked to me for a month, even after exchanging phone numbers before asking me out, but they weren’t having in-depth conversations with me all day long like this guy. 

Now, I’m trying to figure out if my current situation is heading in that slow build to ask for direction or if I’ve just ended up with a pen pal. 

He seems to be the humble, shy sort, but I’m not sure he’s 40M. 
No kids, never married. I am looking for his forever person, as am I. 

The guy I’m talking to and I have been exchanging detailed messages about our days—usually around mealtimes and before bed. 

I know he’s genuinely busy; he works 45 hours a week on-site with a 30-minute commute and plays on two sports teams in two different states, with practices two nights a week and games on Saturdays. 

Winter is my slow season. 

It’s been 9 days of chatting, and he still hasn’t asked me out.

1i2vmtu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAGerman/comments/1i2vmtu/looking_for_guidance_on_how_to_maximize_my_time/,Looking for guidance on how to maximize my time with a weird travel schedule!,"I will be travelling to Germany for a mix of business and pleasure at the end of March/early April. 

I am attending the Hannover Messe conference, but somehow have ended up arriving in Hanover well before the conference is set to begin (and the rest of my colleagues arrive from Canada).

As I've read there are limited things to do in Hanover, my plan right now is to take the train from Hanover to Berlin upon my arrival, spend Wednesday-Saturday in Berlin solo and then return to Hanover to meet my colleagues. 

After all of that, I am planning to take the train from Hanover to Munich to meet my husband (who is flying in from Canada) before we rent a car to roadtrip through Salzburg, Ljubljana, Trieste and Innsbruck before flying home out of Munich again.

So, my questions are as follows:

* Since I will be somewhat remotely working, I'd like to maximize my time in Berlin when I will mostly be available to explore or do things before 2:30pm and after 10:30pm. I would also be very open to bringing my laptop to a pub or coffee shop to work between those hours, so recommendationsor tips for that would also be welcome.
* I doubt I'll have a lot of time during the conference to explore Hanover, but any ""must sees"" that I should consider finding time for in the evenings?
* Any recommendations for areas / things to see outside of Munich that we could access with a car either on our way to/from Salzburg and Innsbruck or with a slight detour?

1i2vmh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/atrioc/comments/1i2vmh0/i_came_up_with_a_new_james_joke/,I came up with a new James joke,"Hey James fans,

You probably know the famous inside joke in the James community that James is a ""coffee cow"", supposedly stating that he loves coffee so much, he’s a “cow” for it. This, of course, is the pinnacle of comedy, and will be the magnum opus of humanity throughout its entire history on this planet. However, I would like you all to consider a new joke to make about James. Perchance.

Here is my idea for a joke: James is a ""Juicy Janitor"". The joke here is that it's saying that James works as a janitor, and in fact, is “juicy” at it. 

Now, I don't know James’ actual opinions about janitors, or if he actually works as one, but nevertheless, it could be funny to bring it up on stream. We can consider two outcomes of this joke:

1. James is not a fan of the ""juicy janitor"" joke

If James does not like the joke, he will tell chat statements such as ""no chat I am not a juicy janitor"" and ""what does that joke even mean?"". By telling his chat that he doesn't like the joke, the chat will not follow his directions and keep repeating the ""Juicy Janitor"" joke to annoy him, generating more content. It is also, if I may, a way to stick it to the man by how James is a prolific member of the bourgeois and we’ll be stripping that status away from him by calling James a lowly janitor.

2. James is a fan of the ""juicy janitor"" joke

If James does like the joke, he will play into the bit, repeatedly calling himself the ""juicy janitor"". Chat will also play into the bit, such as like they did with ""the smoothie king"". James also liking the joke will be progress in the global movement for class solidarity, as he does not mind being a janitor, let alone a juicy one.

I believe this joke has a lot of potential. Think of the things we could have by using this joke. We can have a ""JuicyJames"" emote, leeches can use this joke in their videos, and Ludwig has a new thing to call James now! The #1 thing that we should do is repeat this joke nonstop for 1.5 years. I think doing that will be extremely beneficial to the James community. Perchance.

I hope you all consider this, and decide what's best for all of us.",12,1737052024.0,atrioc,1,1.0,False
1i2vlp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1i2vlp5/doctors_appointment_next_week_what_should_i/,Doctor's appointment next week - what should I request?,"The last flare-up I had was in April 2024 after having a vomiting bug and then immediately going on a cruise where I didn't eat too well. I saw a nurse practitioner who tested my stool for blood and calprotectin (both clear). I also had bloods taken - full blood count, liver and kidneys fine. CRP and ESR were elevated so they were repeated sometime after and although still elevated both had decreased.

Since then I've had some random bouts of diarrhoea but it didn't get bad again until Christmas. I had symptoms around once a week in December (I didn't eat well during November and December) and it kick-started again on Boxing Day after I had lunch out. Since then I haven't been able to eat normally. I'm currently restricting myself to oatmeal/porridge, kefir, bananas, apples, rice, eggs, chicken and the Zoe Daily 30 supplement. I seem to be ok with milk in my coffee and porridge but have reduced my coffee intake to 1 per day. Last week I mostly stuck to this and only had one instance of IBS symptoms, whereas the week before it was almost daily.

On Monday I stuck to the above but had symptoms which I assumed were due to either walking more or having a somatic therapy session.

Tuesday and Wednesday I deviated and had symptoms.

Today I stuck to the above and added a small portion of mashed sweet potato and I've had 3 visits to the bathroom already with loose stools followed by diarrhoea.

Since my symptoms improved last year and CRP and ESR did improve a bit, what should I ask for? SIBO? Colonoscopy? Any advice would be appreciated as this time it's really hanging around.

I had a flexible sigmoidoscopy back in 2011 due to pain in my rectum caused by fissures and gastroscopy in 2014 due to bad acid reflux but I've never been properly tested for IBS and now my symptoms have worsened (if, indeed, this is IBS.)",1,1737051971.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

1i2vl5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/babylon5/comments/1i2vl5e/season_3_episode_4_passing_through_gethsemane/,Season 3. Episode 4 Passing Through Gethsemane,"Holy crap. This was a roller coaster and crammed full of little details.

Fair Warning: My reviews and thoughts post episode are always a bit of a ramble. This one is probably going to be more so because of the concepts we're dealing with in this episode.

This is one of the better depictions of Faith, the idea of service and servant leadership that I've ever seen depicted in television. The idea that we are simply stewards of a larger creation; and a tough examination on the concept of forgiveness. 

I really enjoyed Brother Theo in the last episode he was in. So seeing him again. I knew we were in for a treat. But I was not expecting it to go the way that it did. 

Watching brother Edwards struggle with these memories. The separate visions of who he used to be. After you've already built up, who he is now was brilliant and heartbreaking. 

To borrow something from his own words, when he's talking to Dellenn, Edward struggling with the idea of forgiveness at the end whether or not he's done enough to atone or whether or not there is a God out there that can and will forgive him for who he used to be. even if he can't remember it, it feels like *a genuine fragile human moment.*

Because I think we've all struggled, whether or not we have a faith, on thinking ""I've done something so horrible. How can I ever make up for it.""

I don't know if JMS has a faith, I'm going to look that up after this. But whether or not he does. He seems to get the core of belief right.

He's not wrapped up in the squabbling for power that comes with organized religion: the debates about whether there's enough in the budget to fund the bulletins, or whether or not we're doing everything correctly according to the book of order, or what confession we need to use or how we take communion, either intention or the little plates. 

Instead, JMS hits right at the idea of Faith as something that should be bringing comfort to everyone, But that should also challenge us. That makes us uncomfortable from time to time because it forces us to look at ourselves and answer tough questions about who we are. That when stripped away reveals us as human as people at our most vulnerable and because of that vulnerability at our most open -minded.

And I think he does that brilliantly with Garibaldi. Who in the beginning of the episode was so set and certain that mind wiping is disgusting, and serial killers and murderers should just be outright killed. But then by the end he's met Edward and he's kind of become friends with him and he seems genuinely broken up that he has been murdered that Edward is now gone because of something that his previous persona had done and that this cycle has just continued with the guy who committed the murder.

So I grew up Protestant, I had a period in college of ""atheism"" I'm using the quotations because it was for about a semester, And it never really felt true to me. And I've kind of settled into a pseudo agnostic approach. We don't know whether or not there's a God. I choose to believe there is one but that organized religion gets the idea wrong. I've become more universalist as I've gotten older that we all in all See something of God or creation regardless of religion or without a proclaimed Faith. That there is something in creation which we are all a part of that reflects something larger than us. For myself I see that concept of something larger as God. I'm still pulling on my roots of protestantism there. 😊

But it's what Dellenn said about the Minbari Faith, That really sort of hit me. That the Universe itself is awash in life, flourishing in it. And that we, as part of the universe, are simply agents or tendrils of it searching for meaning, and that the larger concept of a Creator of a god of a being of higher power might simply be the extension of the universe itself. I found something very beautiful in that. I also liked their explanation of the soul. That the body is simply what holds it and it comes from elsewhere. It is gifted from something else. 

I'm wondering if that has to do with why they stopped the Earth War, Because I do remember I believe it was season 2. They reveal that mimbari souls are going into humans and they do not kill themselves so they stopped the war because that would go against everything they believe in. And I'm wondering if that will carry on into something later. 

Either way, I think it's a great concept of... All of creation has a place, all of creation is sacred in a way, all of creation together as a whole is better than one of us sitting alone in the dark.

Honestly, as an aside here, I sort of wish these characters were real and I could talk to them about their beliefs and their religions and their concerns and their thoughts. Because they've done a great job so far. Building up these beliefs. They feel lived in. They feel real if that makes sense. 

I'd love to be able to sit down with someone like Dellenn and have a cup of coffee and have a conversation. Because I think we all have these thoughts in the back of our head occasionally about, not just belief. What is beyond us? What happens after we die? What happens when we say goodbye to people that we love? Is there something more? And I would love to sit down with these characters and discuss it. I'm not sure I would get a firm answer. But it would be an interesting conversation and I think it would be a hopeful one. I think it would be a comforting one. Especially with Dellenn and Lennier. Because I think the more we learn about other people, the more we try to understand their viewpoint, the more open-minded we become, It's how we grow to be better people. We find views we find understandings behind things that are not our own and we try to in good faith grow with that experience. If that makes sense.


The part with Edward deciding to sacrifice himself. Again, there's some wonderful theology there with Brother Theo, Edward is wondering if I can't remember who I am. How can I confess what I've done. 

Now Protestants don't believe we need an intermediary between us and God we can talk to God directly. 

And there's something that Brother Theo says, ""Even if you don't remember what you did, God will remember and you should leave that in his hands."" Again, I really like this because it shows you who Theo is as a person. He cares about Edward, he's doing everything he can to get his friend into a better state of mind to get him the help he needs. And he's trying to reassure him, on the basis of their shared faith, because they believe in their God, it'll be okay, whatever happens, God is going to be in that and God will be there for you. I think it just shows the writers get the complexity of humanity. The little moments. Pleading with a friend to not do something stupid to come back to use a common ground to bring comfort. It's brilliant writing and it's brilliant character work. 

The ending. I'm glad JMS wrote it like that, but it hit me like a ton of bricks. The murderer who, at this point didn't kill the serial killer, he killed Edward. Completely new personality. So he has killed. Essentially a pure soul, somebody who did not commit those crimes, and is not at fault for them. 

Brother Theo. Talking about ""Faith saying forgiveness is probably the hardest thing we can do."" I'm nodding along and you know thinking yeah I agree with that. And then they hit you with his reveal that he is now changed, reborn as a different person. And you have to struggle with that as a viewer because he killed Edward. But that's not him. Just like Edward was not the serial killer that hurt those women. 

But it looks like him. Just as Edward must have looked like the man who murdered those women to him. So it's a fantastic juxtaposition for the viewer. And for Sheridan who has to struggle with that for a minute and then shake his hand. 

Jms doesn't pull his punches here and he leaves you with that ultimate call: now you have to forgive him. Can you do it?

This episode left me in tears, and it left me spinning. Because, it hits it questions that I've asked while I've laid awake at night. Am I good enough, have I done enough, is there a God, is there life after death etc etc. Etc. And I think it works so well because it clings to a basic human characteristic that we all share, we want to know more, we want to understand more. We want to explore different things. We want to be in community with each other. 

Fantastic episode. Thank you for letting me ramble. What did you all think of this episode? Do you have a faith similar or different to this? Do you have your own concepts of belief? Or did this episode stir something in you that touched on something vitally human? I'd love to know.",15,1737051933.0,babylon5,15,1.0,False

Today, I want to talk about one often-overlooked hero of the brewing process: **water temperature**. Here's why it matters, and some practical tips to get it right, even without a thermometer.

https://preview.redd.it/u9jlwe35fede1.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f7718a1ade738917ff64b86ad4f323cd6e69122b

# Why Water Temperature Matters:

1. **Extraction Balance**:
   * Water temperature directly affects how compounds in coffee dissolve.
   * Too cool (<185°F/85°C): Under-extraction occurs, leading to sour, weak flavors.
   * Too hot (>205°F/96°C): Over-extraction happens, causing bitter, harsh notes.
2. **Flavor Clarity**:
   * Ideal water temp (195-205°F/90-96°C) enhances sweetness and clarity. It allows the complex acids, sugars, and aromatic oils to shine without overshadowing one another.
3. **Solubility of Coffee Compounds**:
   * Hot water efficiently dissolves the soluble compounds responsible for flavor. Using water outside the optimal range might miss key notes or overemphasize undesirable ones.
4. **Consistency Across Brews**:
   * Maintaining proper water temperature is essential for replicating your favorite cup. Fluctuations introduce unpredictability.
5. **Brew Time Synchronization**:
   * Water that’s too cold slows down the brewing process, while overly hot water speeds it up, throwing off your carefully timed recipe.

# Practical Tips for Managing Water Temperature:

1. **Use a Gooseneck Kettle with a Built-in Thermometer**:
   * This is the gold standard for precision and control.
2. **Heat Water to Boiling, Then Cool Slightly**:
   * If you don’t have a thermometer, bring water to a rolling boil and let it sit for 30-45 seconds to reach the right range.
3. **Preheat Your Equipment**:
   * Pour some hot water over your dripper and mug to minimize heat loss during brewing.
4. **Consider the Altitude**:
   * If you're at high altitude, water boils at a lower temperature. Adjust accordingly by heating just past the boil.

# How to Estimate Water Temperature Without a Thermometer:

If you're thermometer-free, here’s a simple trick:

1. Bring your water to a rolling boil.
2. Remove it from the heat source.
3. Wait 30 seconds for a lighter roast (around 205°F/96°C) or up to 1 minute for medium/darker roasts (around 195°F/90°C).

Alternatively, pay attention to visual and auditory cues:

* **195-205°F**: You’ll see steam rising steadily but without aggressive bubbling. The water will be ""calmly hot,"" not violently boiling.
* Practice this with a thermometer to train your intuition for future brews!

Dialing in the water temperature may seem like a small detail, but trust me—it’s a game changer for getting the most out of your beans. Cheers to better coffee, one degree at a time! ☕

  *Being lactose-intolerant somewhat helped me. It inspires me to read the labels all the time and cook more. I never read the labels before except for checking if something had honey in it because i'm allergic. But that's so different with lactose. I never knew how much foods actually contain it. That's why it's funny to me how many people think that we can just stop drinking milk and we will be fine. But there is something which makes me mad - Some people call us posers for choosing the alternative milk for our coffee! (Even if i wasn't lactose-intolerance i would still choose the alternative milk sometimes, because that's tasty! Why do they call people posers for just having a preference?!?)*

   *This is how my diet has changed:*

1)I haven't bought mashed potatoes because there is always milk in it. And i'm too lazy to peel the potatoes myself. But i will get to it and use water instead.

2)I'm used to making cocoa and porridge with water. Sometimes i use oat milk for making a banana cocoa. (I make it like a smoothie, then microwave the mug.)

3)When i cook something that needs mayo, i use a sour cream. Yes, there is still lactose, but sour cream is healthier than mayo. I have had ketchup and tomato pasta once. I was fine. I think i can eat it sometimes. Can i? (I don't consume mayo sauces.)

4)The dark chocolate, sugar crisps(difficult to translate), muesli bars and dried fruit are my go-to snacks. I check the labels and most of those have no lactose.

5)I make the blinis with ryazhenka (it's like kefir) and the blinis turn out to be perfect! Those taste even better than the blinis i made with milk. Today i bought the blinis which were made with kefir. I'm not ready to give up pancakes...

6)Guilty as charged! I let myself eat french fries and nuggets. I had four nuggets, carrot sticks and french fries today. It's ironic but i still can eat at McDonalds! There are apple slices, carrot sticks, french fries, pies and nuggets. (I'm not sure i can count the nuggets, but i eat those very seldom.)

7)Many cafes cater to different intolerances. I knew that before but i didn't read the menus carefully, didn't know that i couldn't eat something. But i had to stop eating most of the food at my favorite place. 

8)This sounds funny, but that's really the change to me. I had to start grating the cheese. I hated doing it but i would always but the grated cheese. What's funny is that they sell lactose-free cheese in slices or hard pieces, not grated. And i check if noodles are lactose-free too. (Most of brands are!)

When searching NPC saddle bags, there is a chance of finding collectibles. You risk getting kicked, but sometimes the horses will just let you look without issue. Calming the horse down, patting it , or riding it a bit (you risk getting negative honor for horse thief) always eventually lets you rummage through the saddle bags. I just found a loon egg on one side of the saddle, and an ivory hair pin on the other on a Kentucky Saddler near the Van Horn fast travel post. I figured with the collectible event going on, I might share this tidbit Incase any of you didn't know. 

I have also found tarot cards and arrowheads in saddle bags in the past. There are typically unattended horses outside the old saloon in Emerald, some outside the saloon in Van Horn, and some outside the Rhodes parlour house (typically more horses at night). 

I hope this helps someone. Happy thieving. ",5,1737051635.0,RedDeadOnline,2,1.0,False

I'll make something clear to start with.. I live in the UK. I didn't actually want to end up taking on this job as I know just how much hard work it is, no appreciation, treated like a pain/nuisance from dentists because you need teaching, underpaid, etc etc etc because I had previously taken on a DA apprenticeship at a Mydentist practice.. it was a terrible experience, basically one nasty dentist was left in to work in this building because everyone else had left/moved on, she treated it like her playground and made it unbearable for any new trainee. Of course I found out like everyone else, that I was one of many who wouldn't be spoken to and treated like utter shit, I left just under the 3 months. No manager on-site, had to reach out to another branch for support, did what I could but ultimately it put me off. This was back in 2022. Fast forward to March 2024, I lost out to a fantastic opportunity at the local hospital, all due to an unsatisfactory reference, which I had never ever had that happen in my life, a lot of people said it was unfair/harsh but it was what it was, I was devastated.. I've dealt with depression since I was a kid, diagnosed ADHD/ADD combined in 2022. Let's just say I've found it hard to find a job that I enjoy/suits me, let alone the fact that where I live is genuinely bad for jobs. It's basically care work galore (which I'm already qualified in of course 🤣🤣)

So I found myself having to apply for the best of what was there within my range, a factory job (which I'm experienced in and actually wanted, it's better paid but mundane repetitive work) or a dental nurse apprenticeship that is a 10 minute walk from where I live. Life has a track record of not being kind to me, I normally end up with the uphill struggle, so it was no surprise to me that I didn't get offered the factory job (even tho I had a friend that put in a good work for me and as I said I had factory experience, I didn't get it. Of course, I got offered a job at the dental practice and had no choice but to take it. I was already in debt due to waiting on the NHS hospital job, the recruitment process takes an awful long time, only to find the leasing manager of the department didn't want to give me a chance.

Here I am, about half way through my DA course, I've had issues that I knew would happen (unhelpful, bully-ish colleagues), a dentist that is barely interested in teaching me and begrudges it but knows she has no choice.. Why dentists feel the need to be like this when they literally need you to be able to do their job, I do not know 💁🏼‍♀️

I am in a private practice. I have been here 9 months, guess how many times I've done RCT stage 2?

.....TWICE. 😂

I've been more than vocal to my manager that I just don't understand how I'm meant to get this course done when we barely do full RCT (due to demand, people can't afford it, etc). I've had observations done once, only got a handful of bits done (decon, glass ionomer, can't remember the rest. Couldn't even get a comp filling done due to the patient not turning up 😅😂)

This dentist I work with, although begrudgingly shows me what to do, is a good, decent person and has had a lot happen last year, e.g. divorce, life upside down, so has gone down to 4 days a week and doesn't even do full days (9.30-3pm or 4pm variant of that). 

Oh, did I forget to mention that they took on a second apprentice that started a week after me, that got out with a different dentist, according to the lead nurse didn't make an effort to learn at all and had to be forced to actually try things herself rather than 'observing' which was Saturday on her arse, on her phone drinking coffee. She said after a couple of months to our manager that she doesn't want to work with that dentist, she'd prefer to try to work with mine. My manager, for whatever reason, just gave her what she wanted.  No questions, no push, nothing. Now, I'm not blaming the other trainee personally, but the impact her requests have had a negative effect on me (it basically left me with 2 days with the dentist, a study day and assisting hygienists all the rest of my time. She, had 3 days with the dentist I work with, a study day and was spare on the other day. That changed after a few months when the dentist dropped down to 4 days as I already mentioned, and funnily enough not long after, the other trainee said she needed to drop a day because it was too much. I genuinely believe she thought she would end up with all her time being with that dentist and I'd be made to be with the other one, haha. Didn't happen that way. I was always meant to be the person with this dentist, she is the best to learn from and actually does treatments that I need to learn.. the other dentists barely do RCT! (We have 3 dentists in total). 

So I'm at a point where I'm just laughing at it all. I put so much into my work. This industry and the way it is makes it such a nasty struggle. I know other people have been fortunate to meet wonderful dentists and have a great career because of this! And some of us like myself just aren't lucky like that.

I get no answers from anyone, including the course supplier - meaning I've told the assessor that we barely get RCT here.. she just says 'well when the next one is booked just move it to the date I'm going to see you...' 😂😂 yeah good one, we barely get it booked and you're expecting to see two of us do it! It's hilarious. 
oh and she expects me and the other trainee to be seen in the same day, due to out location being a pain to get to 🙄 we haven't even got a date for the next observations! I just feel everything/everyone is slack and doesn't have any definitive answers for anything! I asked if it could be taped by someone but understandably they can't assess you doing RCT or crown prep over video. 🙃

This job isn't the easiest as it is, let alone it being made so painful for me in every aspect!!!! I have a fairly good relationship with the dentist I work with and I'm petrified that if I leave for another surgery I'll just be faced with the same/similar problems, I know there are horrible toxic coworkers wherever you go, that's sadly just a given! But to put all this work in and learn to work with one dentist, and drop it and learn to work with someone else aaaalllll over again? And they could turn out to be horrendous like my first experience at Mydentist! 

I know you'll all read this and go damn girl... JUST LEAVE AND FIND SOMETHING ELSE but honestly, the housing and jobs are so minimal it's a crisis here. I refuse to leave and just run into any old job because I've done it so many times before, I will only leave if it's for something recently paid/enough hours and it's a decent job. So of course, as much as have wanted to leave very early on there, I've had no bloody choice. 

I'm on new antidepressants that are actually helping me deal with a lot of the shit and not care so much... But it's not in my nature to not care about something I put so much hard work into. My emotions are like a yo-yo because of how they are in there. One minute I think ugh just get through the course and then other times I'm just desperate to leave. 

There is much more to this, I haven't even explained what makes the colleagues so bad! But that's for another rant. I'll stop now.

I don't suppose anyone else has been in a similar boat? HALP 😂",1,1737051381.0,DentalAssistant,2,1.0,False

1i2vb1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1i2vb1g/how_can_i_m30_address_relationship_problems_with/,How can I (M30) address relationship problems with extremely anxious partner (F30)?,"Do you think I am doing too much in our relationship? How do I talk about my personal issues with our relationship with someone who is in a delicate state of mind?

I (M30) started a relationship with a girl (F30) about two months ago, and I have put a tremendous effort into acts of service and emotional support for her. For context, she works insane hours at a hospital (13 hours/day with occasional 24 hour shift), and she does not enjoy her job. Unsurprisingly, she suffers from panic attacks and extreme anxiety, to the point where she is frequently waking up in the middle of the night shaking and calling off work, which cascades into more work stress for her. This is, of course, not a healthy way to live. She is so worried that there is something wrong with her making her feel anxious, nauseous, sick, and depressed all the time. It is really worrying to witness, and I do really care about her well-being. But, I have my own issues too, and constantly supporting her has been very difficult and is throwing my life out of balance, and I no longer feel like an equal in our relationship.

  
She has tried medicine, therapy, meditation and journaling, and is constantly looking for new (maybe obscure) solutions, such as religion, volunteer work, etc. I have convinced her to take some time off work, which she has finally worked out with her boss. I also reached out to my friends, who have treated anxiety with certain medications, and had them share their stories with her and answer her questions based on their experiences. I think she is on the right path, in general, to getting better. But she is still in a very fragile state of mind, constantly feels nauseous and anxious, deals with manic panic attacks, gets migraines, etc.



What she still has yet to address is her sleep schedule, diet, and exercise routine. This is crazy to me, but she refuses to drink water. She gets these crazy migraines and feels nauseous all the time, and is willing to ""try anything to fix herself"", but drinking water is ""too difficult"". She worries that she has some disease that makes it hard to drink water, and has thought about getting tested and taking some steroid or whatever to take care of her kidneys. Idk. That actually really frustrates me because drinking water is not hard, and I feel strongly that it would help with a lot of her problems. Its at least worth a shot and makes more sense than trying another pill. It makes me think that she actually isn't trying hard enough. Or...maybe I actually don't understand her condition.

  
So that was all context. Obviously, she objectively has a lot of mental problems that she needs to address and is addressing. What I really need help with is understanding is if we have an unhealthy relationship and if so, how can I salvage it if possible. I have written out a few of my biggest frustrations.

* Drive to see her daily. If I can't see her, we talk on the phone for hours. This was fine at first, but it has since become a chore, and I am finding it harder to keep up with my good habits, such as healthy sleep schedule, exercise, and time with friends. Usually, our phone calls are her complaining and even crying about how she feels and me consoling her. If I can't see her or talk to her for as long as she wants, she can get upset/depressed/insecure, and it makes me feel guilty. I have tried to include her in my activities, such as going to the gym or hanging with my friends, but every time I have tried to integrate her into my life, she feels nauseous and is totally out of it. I don't know what my friends think of her, but the vibe is usually uncomfortable when we are all together. 
   * A small little anecdote: I was sick with COVID or something a few weeks ago. Every day that week, I woke up from a mid-day nap to drive to her house and go on a walk with her, wearing a mask. I did not want to, but she was having a hard time and wanted to see me, so I felt obligated to. One of the days, she was complaining about how she felt. Meanwhile, I was suffering from a headache, joint pain, exhaustion and a head ache. I was not a great conversationalist that day, and I had a hard time consoling her since I was dealing with my own health issues, which she had no concerns about. Because I didn't console her good enough, she thought ""I wasn't excited to see her"". I had to explain to her that I was feeling exhausted and sick, myself, and did not have enough energy to give you the support she was looking for.  

* She talks about her exes A LOT. It is crazy. I had to tell her that it feels extremely humiliating when you talk about your exes to your friends around me. ""Last time I was here, I was on a date..."" or ""My ex and I did that once..."". When we are alone, its even worse. She is constantly telling me how bad her ex used to be or how I remind her of her other ex or how her parents like me more than her exes etc etc. I told her that she can talk to me about anything, but I really don't like it when she brings up her exes. I have never mentioned my previous relationship history to her beyond the basic stuff when we were initially starting to date. I also told her explicitly that I would really like it if she stopped talking about her exes in front of other people when I am around.

* When we have sex, I often feel inadequate and maybe used. She is far and away a more sexual person than me. We will literally be feeling each other up, and she will look at me disappointed and say shit like ""I want to turn you on"" or ""I want you to want me so much you struggle"" when I am literally fully hard and making out with her. I also really enjoy hands stuff--recently, she said something like ""I wish you would get excited about being inside of me as much as you do when I touch you"" literally after I just climaxed from vaginal sex. Idk, little comments like that make me feel a little inadequate sometimes. I am a pretty compassionate person, and comments like that make me question our compatibility.

* She does not treat her family well in my eyes. Her mom is currently visiting her from Texas for an indefinite period of time to take care of her at the request of my girlfriend. She straight up assigns tasks to her mom, such as picking up dog toys or buying items for her house. She also told me that she told her mom she still wants to see me privately, which makes me feel uncomfortable because when we hang out, I am just thinking about how her mom is just hanging out at her house with nothing to do until my gf returns. Or the other night, I was sort of coerced into hooking up with my gf in her bedroom while her mom was doing the dishes right outside, which I really was not into. I verbalized that to her, but she still applied pressure to have sex anyway, which we ended up doing.

* She does not take great care of her pets. Her dog barks so much and she does not feed her lizards on a consistent schedule. The dog really bugs me though. She has neighbors, and she is totally fine with having her dog bark on her balcony whenever someone is walking by. Or, she is fine leaving her dog tied up outside a coffee shop, barking up a storm, while she goes inside to get coffee. I've tried to stay outside with her dog to keep it from being a disturbance, but she will guilt me into coming inside with her because ""she wants to be with me"". This worries me a little bit if we  maintain our relationship and ever have children.

* In general, she complains a lot. She hates being cold to the point where she will avoid the cold altogether. Or she hates water, so she doesn't drink water. I think this bothers me so much because I do things that are hard all the time, and getting cold time to time or drinking water to stay hydrated are not hard things to do. 

So I know everyone's advice is probably going to be that you need to talk with her. My dilemma is I really, truly care about her, and I want her to get mentally healthy. I don't want to give her any reason to have more stress or reasons to panic. It truly is scary how terribly anxious she is and the toll it is taking on her. God, I can't even imagine how she would handle a break up in her current mental state if we got to that point. So what does a third party opinion look like? Is this relationship fucked?  Is there anything I can do, so we can feel more like equals?

1i2v9bt,https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1i2v9bt/weekly_recap_january_16_2025/,"Weekly Recap | JANUARY 16, 2025","Why, hello there! Welcome to another edition of the Weekly Recap where we recap the week! Let's see what happened in case you missed something!

**NEWS AND ISSUES**

* Reddit released the Q3 Safety & Security report for 2024. You can read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditSafety/comments/1i0ne04/q3_2024_safety_security_report_election_recap_and/). 

* The Content Policy has been renamed ""Reddit Rules"" and this was announced in the post linked above. Longtime Redditors might remember that “rules” was actually the original name of the Content Policy. But the name “Reddit Rules” better reflects that our policies govern both content AND behavior on Reddit. This is just a name change and doesn’t affect the content of the rules themselves. You can read the Reddit Rules [here](https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules).

* There was a little tiny outage on Tuesday, the 14th. It was resolved fairly quickly, so the status page did not have a chance to get updated. 

* The fix for iOS buttons being unresponsive should be out in the 2025.02 version of the app. If you have updated to that version and are still having issues, please nicely let me know and I'll pass it on to the team that's working on that. 

* Some users may be seeing duplicate posts in their home feed. This has been fixed and will go out in the 2025.03 version of the app. 

* The banana icon for the Reddit Recap should be gone at this time. If you're still seeing it, please update the app. If you did not view your Recap for some reason and would like to now that it is gone, that is not possible. It's over. But come back next year! 

*Next week's app release will be delayed a little bit due to the US holiday of MLK Day. It will still go out, but just a little bit later than usual.

**BUGS ROUNDUP**

* [Web] Comment/post overflow menu actions are broken - The fix is on the way

* [iOS] The app crashes when you try to sort the rules within the mod tools - This will be fixed in version 2025.03

* [iOS] Some users were reporting a blank comment section - This has been fixed!

Thanks to u/CorrectScale and all of the work going on over in r/bugs. If you are experiencing a bug, please head over there to report it! 

**ONGOING ISSUES**

* If your account gets the ""server error"" banner or you can't update your profile, I can fix that sometimes! Just let me know and I'll take a look and get you all taken care of! Please note that I cannot give any information or assist with any account unless contacted directly from that account. **I cannot fix accounts where you are receiving the ""server error"" message and are unable to view content from that account when logged out.** In those instances, you will need to file an appeal. 

* If no one else can see your posts or comments across Reddit (not just in one sub) and you are unable to post here in r/help, you can file an appeal [here](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000600232). 

* Please check the [Help Center](https://www.reddithelp.com/) to see if you can find the answer to your question there. Also, check this sub for stickied posts regarding outages and downtime. 

* If your account is marked as NSFW and it is not NSFW, you can check out [this Help Center article](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043471131-Why-was-my-profile-marked-as-Not-Safe-for-Work-NSFW-and-how-can-I-change-it) for information on how to change it back. If you're unable to change it back, feel free to make a post and we'll help you out. (Team effort, this one is! Thanks to all of the helpers who flag me for this.)

* Last week, there were a multitude of issues that were brought up that I addressed in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1hxj9j7/weekly_recap_january_9_2025/m69lvcv/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1hxj9j7/weekly_recap_january_9_2025/m69m4bd/) comment. Huge thanks to u/jgoja for cataloging all of these and bringing them to the table so that I could get really good at filing tickets and get everything in front of the correct teams and track things along the way. So far, we've made progress in a couple of areas:

  * The number of subreddits that you can view on the sidebar is intentionally capped at 250. If you are subscribed to more than 250 subreddits, you can view the entire list over on old Reddit by going here: https://www.reddit.com/subreddits/mine

  * The issue with not being able to see more than 25 subreddits in a custom feed has been fixed. 

**WEEKLY STATISTICS**

Over the past 7 days, r/help had 1,758 posts, which is only 22 fewer posts than the 1,780 posts in the previous 7 days. And there were 4,743 comments which is up just 42 comments from the 4,701 comments the previous seven days. So we're holding pretty steady! 2,800 new users subscribed to r/help last week (exactly the same as the previous week's 2,800 subscriptions) and there were over 1.3 million views, which is the same as the 1.3  million views last week. Consistency all the way around in r/help! 

**TOP POSTS**

* **[Can I filter out posts with certain topics?](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1hx4l35/no_trump_no_musk/)**

A user was hoping to rid their feed of topics that they don't want to see. They don't necessarily want to unsubscribe from those subs, but they don't want to see posts on certain topics. I hear ya. We're all tired. lol Unfortunately, there is not a way to filter out specific topics. As super mod and awesome helper u/westcoastcdn19 said ""You can mute subreddits that are likely to feature the type of content you’re trying to avoid, but no way to use key words to filter posts"".

* **[Your free awards are back for another 36 hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1hxlr4i/your_free_awards_are_back_for_another_36_hours/)**

Some users had free awards that were to expire on December 31 at a specific time. Due to some sort of technical irregularity, some users awards expired before that stated time. Our friend u/sticksfigured stopped by to let us know that everyone who had free awards that expired to early would be getting them back and had 36 more hours until January 10, 2025 at 11:59:59 PT to use them up. Thanks, Sticks! 

* **[How do you report a subreddit that is breaking the rules?](https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/1hylqb7/why_so_many_hateful_subreddits/)**

A user had run across some subs that were explicitly violating the newly renamed [Reddit Rules](https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules). If you see content that is violating the rules of Reddit, please report it! You can use the report button underneath the content to report individual violations. If you would like to report an entire subreddit, you can use [this form](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360001103212) and under ""What is your community concern?"", please select ""I want to report a subreddit for violating the Reddit Rules"". Then fill out the rest of the form. It would be super helpful if you could include links to the violating content. That way, even if the subreddit isn't in violation of the rules, the user who posted violating content can be actioned.
