( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The fluorescent lights buzz like caffeinated bees. A motivational poster on the wall reads: “The cup may be half empty, but it has the potential to be full!”

 

Caite is hunched over her clipboard, floating half an inch above the floor. She’s mid-sandwich bite when she freezes. Her eyes widen. There’s a familiar, cold rush of horror. The feeling of something wet and sticky slides between her legs.

 

She looks down. Then up.

 

Caite whispering: “Oh no. No, no, no, no!”

 

She rummages through her bag with the urgency of a surgeon mid-crisis: pens, sticky notes, half a granola bar, zero salvation. Her breath quickens.

 

Enter Flo. Like a storm in heels and bad intentions. Her lab coat sparkles, literally. Her name badge reads: “Flo B. Dangerfield, Agent of Mild Chaos.”

 

She stops short, clocking Caite’s face and smiles slow and wide.

 

Flo: “Well, well. Somebody’s got the thousand-yard stare of impending doom.”

 

Caite: “Not now, Flo.”

 

Flo: “Oh, but now is when I thrive.”

 

Flo glides closer, perfume trailing like weaponized sugar.

 

Flo: “What’s the crisis? Lost another clipboard to the gravitational pull of your own perfection?”

 

Caite grits her teeth: “Red alert.”

 

Flo blinks. Once. Twice. Then she grins.

 

Flo: “Ohhh. A Code Red. Deliciously mortal.”

 

Caite glares: “I’m serious. I don’t have anything.”

 

Flo: “Oh, darling, that’s tragic. But also… predictable. Didn’t your generation invent those period tracker apps? What happened, battery die of shame?”

 

Caite: “You’re unbelievable.”

 

Flo perches on the counter like an evil cat.

 

Flo: “Oh, I believe plenty. Including that it’s time we restocked that sad excuse for an emergency kit you call a purse.”

 

Caite stands, shoulders stiff.

 

Caite: “I’ll just go ask around. Someone–anyone– has to have–”

 

Flo raises a single manicured hand.

 

Flo: “Oh, don’t trouble them. I might have something.”

 

Caite exhales in relief: “Thank goodness.”

 

Flo rummages through her glittery tote bag with theatrical flair. Lipsticks, receipts, a rogue glow stick. She finally produces something and holds it up between two fingers like a prize.

 

It’s a post-it note. Shaped like a heart and bright pink.

 

Flo: “Here you go, dear.”

 

Caite stares.

 

Caite: “That’s paper.”

 

Flo: “It’s absorbent!”

 

Caite: “That’s not how–”

 

Flo: “Innovation, Caite. You’re a problem solver. Be resourceful.”

 

Caite’s face goes flat as a heart monitor.

 

Caite: “You are the worst.”

 

Flo grins: “Thank you. I work hard at it.”

 

The door opens. Desdemona leans in, sipping her juice box with curiosity on her face. She takes one look at Caite. Then at Flo. Then sighs.

 

Without a word, she produces a pad from her bag, holds it out to Caite who takes it like a sacred relic.

 

Dez: “Here. Always carry spares. Never trust villains.”

 

Caite: “Thank you, Dez. You’re an angel.”

 

Desdemona nods: “Always.”

 

She leaves as quietly as she came. Flo rolls her eyes.

 

Flo: “Show-off.”

 

Caite glares, marching past her toward the restroom.

 

Caite: “I’m filing a complaint.”

 

Flo: “Make sure to cc HR. They love me.”

 

Caite stops at the doorway, smirking just enough.

 

Caite: “I’ll cc the vending machine union, too. I hear they’re taking new grievances.”

 

Flo freezes.

 

“You wouldn’t.”

 

Caite: “Watch me.”

 

Flo narrows her eyes, muttering to herself.

 

The coffee pot hisses. A sign taped to it reads: “Nice try, Flo.”

1o92bqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasVegas/comments/1o92bqy/aria_trip_report/,Aria Trip Report,"Just stayed for 3 nights in a comped 1BR penthouse sky suite at Aria.  I’m a decently-sized player but nothing major.  So maybe it’s true that Vegas is indeed hurting, because I don’t deserve that offer.  

I was really excited to stay in the room, though I have to say that upon entering it, there was a small sense of disappointment.  The best word that describes the room ambience is probably “sterile”.  Every part of the suite is white. There is no carpeting in the main two rooms; only white tiled floors.  The suite is comprised of three separate rooms: the living area, the dining area, and the bedroom.  It would have felt so much more spacious if the dining room and the living area were not separated. I’m guessing the wall between them was structural, but it really made a difference.  Each room was smallish and you couldn’t see or talk to your significant other if you weren’t in the same room.

The suite lounge is also a miss, in my opinion.   It’s pretty smallish, is awkwardly placed, and feels like an afterthought.  They have free coffee and water, which admittedly is no small savings in Vegas.  But the light bites were fairly standard, somewhat tasteless, and very repetitive.  They do serve wine during certain hours, but there are no signs and you have to ask one of the attendants.  I only found this out because I overheard someone else asking.  And the wine is bizarrely served in plastic soda cups with lids and straws, so not exactly a classy experience. 

The Aria casino is pretty expansive, with a good selection of slots.  There were several of every game, including the new ones, so really anything you wanted to play you could pretty much find an empty one immediately.  (The one exception to this is Dracula, which seems to have completely disappeared from Las Vegas casinos as quickly as they came - confusing.)

The Aria has relaxed their blackjack 3 -2 minimums.  They used to be a $100-only casino, almost the only one on the strip save maybe Wynn/Encore, but now they have 3-2 on their 50s.  By the way, Cosmo still has $25 3-2, as I’m sure does ParkMGM.

On my last day, I had a pretty negative experience at a blackjack table. I sat down in the morning, and the dealer told me that the machine to shuffle the cards was not working, but they had called someone to fix it and he would be right over. So while we’re waiting, I buy in and she’s giving me chips.  She starts talking and somehow the mayoral race in New York City came up. For those that don’t know, a super progressive candidate is the front runner. She is absolutely going off on this guy. Now I’m not a fan of his either, though I am middle-left. With very little provocation from me, she starts spouting off every Fox News viewpoint on this race that I can handle. I’m a pretty easy-going guy so I’m just listening and pretending to laugh and it’s all fine, but going full unprompted MAGA in a customer-facing position seems an odd strategy. 

So just as we’re about to start, her replacement taps her.  She says good-heartedly to the guy, “treat my boy here right.”  Sounds good to me, so I laugh and say to the new dealer “I gotta catch a plane in a few hours, so I’m really hoping to win some money back!”

His answer?  “That’s all fine and good, but what are you gonna do for me?  If I treat you good, are you gonna take care of me?  Everyone says they want to win, and then when it’s time to take care of their dealer they suddenly forget.”  This is close to verbatim.

I’m completely taken aback, but it’s the morning and there’s only one empty table (this one).  There’s nowhere else to go.  And like I said, I’m easy-going, so I just kind of laugh, ignore it, and we start playing. 

In three minutes, after winning every hand with some doubles mixed in, I’m up $500, have my bet up to $250, and ask to change in a quarter for reds.  I put up a $10 bet for him, get an 18, and lose.  Not a peep from the dealer as he takes both bets.  I’ve finally had enough and say “not even a thank you?” He says, and I’m not kidding, “well I didn’t win.”  Alright, I’m done.  Ask him to color my chips.  I’m up nicely in the three minutes, so I didn’t really care that I didn’t get to play much.  But I did spend a solid minute calmly and politely telling him that his attitude was terrible, explaining in detail every awful thing he did.  He tried to play it off like I was misunderstanding him, but we both knew that was nonsense.  He started our interaction with a chip on his shoulder and ended by not thanking me for trying to tip him.  

Anyway, so now we get to the slot vulture team.  This happened earlier on the trip.  There’s a set of machines at Aria which have “must hit by” bonuses, which means that as people keep playing, you can tell by a certain number displayed on the machine how close it is to popping off a significant bonus.  This one machine was at 197 yellow diamonds (must hit by 200, and yellow was the best color), and some guy just sat there, hogging the machine and barely playing if at all, but calling his buddy to come on over.  These guys work in teams, for those who don’t know.  About thirty minutes later, another guy comes in and puts about a thousand dollars in the machine.  I keep strolling by and see it’s now at 199.  On my next pass, I see the guy taking a pic with his phone - it landed, and on a $4 bet he hit a 550x for $2,200.

I’ve heard a casino exec say that these vultures aren’t stealing money from other patrons, but they are stealing fun.  I could not agree more.  These “persistent-state” machines should be outlawed in my opinion; at best, they prey on people’s addiction by making it hard to stop when you’re close, and at worst, you see these vultures swoop in. Watching all of this happen was really kind of gross.

Btw, Aria (and really all of MGM) has set their machines super tight.  It just seems to get worse every trip I take.  My RTP over the stay was literally around 65%.  I know they can’t go that low legally but they must really be around the 82-85% range for it to even be possible for me to hit a three day outlier in the 60s.  It’s really so much less fun to play than it ever was. 

Meals were good as always.  Two nights at Noodles (Bellagio), which is our comfort food.  Btw, there’s an off-menu dessert I highly recommend: Chinese donuts with condensed milk dipping sauce.  It’s ridiculously rich but who cares; it’s Vegas. We had a good lunch at Din Tai Fung (they might make the best broccoli on the planet), and a decent buffet at Wicked Spoon.  For the plane ride home, we stopped at the Aria Patisserie and got two $18 hearty sandwiches.  They were excellent.

Drink service in the casino was spotty.  I ordered maybe six vodka sodas, and two of them had effectively zero alcohol in them.  One was supposedly a double, ha.

Vegas was crowded!  It turned out our trip coincided with a huge Oracle AI conference. So maybe that’s what made the city feel not so dead, like a lot of media reports are suggesting. And though it was technically the Columbus Day weekend, even on Tuesday night it was quite busy.

Overall, we had a great time. The only complaint is that the RTPs they’re currently delivering are going to be the death of Vegas. It’s just not fun to almost never bank a winning session. But it’s still a great town, and I hope they find a way to make their money while also giving people a slightly better time.  We’ll still lose; it will just take a little longer.

FYI, no delays at all at the airports from the govt shutdown.  Everything super smooth.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

i have also been wondering if i should get tested for any autoimmune diseases, since it seems people with endometriosis are more likely to also be diagnosed with conditions like RA, hashimoto's, lupus, etc. i'm curious if anyone has also had this happen to them and would suggest getting tested bc of the likelihood.",1,1760709834.0,Endo,0,1.0,False

         Birds sing in the early morning sun as daybreak falls upon Jeju Island. Celine stirs as she sits up and looks out her window, basking in the sunlight. She then gets up and shuffles to her small, homely kitchen to place firewood in her stove to heat the house up. Celine had taken to an off the grid lifestyle after she and the Sunlight Sisters disbanded. She had also thought it best to raise Rumi in a secluded area, away from any judgment or even potential persecution, to keep her safe. Celine makes herself a cup of coffee as she then sits by her kitchen window, enjoying the beautiful nature outside. Celine contemplates her relationship with Rumi, ever since their big fight, and how Rumi hasn’t reached out to her since then. Her gaze then falls to an old image of herself and Ryu Miyeong, Rumi’s mother, posing side by side together, the photo laminated in a portrait frame. Celine stares at the photo for a long time, reminiscing about the good times she had with Ryu. She remembers the two of them going on their first Hunter mission together, their date at the summer fair, and the two of them climbing the Great Seonangdang as children. Sometimes, Celine thinks she can still hear her laugh. Rumi has the same laugh, she thinks to herself. She continues to think about how Rumi has so many of the qualities that she loved about Ryu, only to be reminded of the patterns on Rumi that she had always hated. They reminded Celine of the demon that stole Ryu away from her, all those years ago. Despite her prejudice, Celine loves Rumi like a daughter, and she’s willing to fight to keep that love. Finishing her coffee, Celine gets dressed, grabs her already packed bags and makes her way outside; destination, Seoul.

1o925nl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1o925nl/my_adhd_vanished_for_2_weeks_when_i_had_to_rescue/,My ADHD vanished for 2 weeks when I had to rescue my daughter from abroad. No meds,"Context: I'm a single mom in the US with my family and daughter ocean away. No help. I was severely depressed, getting evicted and broke. I had 2 weeks to bring my 6-year-old home for school.
The Unlikely Miracle: Then, something clicked. My brain's chemistry changed abruptly, as if it decided to fix itself.

What I Did:
1. I unconsciously dropped my phone—no scrolling, no YouTube. This wasn't a willpower thing; my brain just rejected it. I made a master list for my daughter's move, splitting tasks by week, then by day. Over morning coffee, I planned my day in shifts: what to finish by 9am, 12 pm, 3 pm, 6 pm, and 9 pm, breaking it down by the hour.
2. Sleep Fixed Itself: I slept 11pm-6:30am naturally without pills, waking up energized.
3. In 2 weeks, I: cleaned my apartment. My place was a physical version of my brain – total chaos. I found a school and registered my daughter, got approved for housing aid (a massive 1-day paperwork feat), bought/assembled a bed for my daughter and got the toy storage. Arranged for the super to paint while I was away and found someone to look after my dog. Worked my side hustles (still had to borrow money for tickets), packed and caught my flight!

The Result & Relapse:
I succeeded! But later, I returned to my baseline severe ADHD. Now I'm on Adderall but struggling again. I want to try to kickstart that mode again, but on purpose.

My 3 Keys to Unlock That Mode:
1. Remove Your #1 Distraction: For me, it was my phone. For you, it might be smth different.  Identify it and cut it off. Non-negotiable.
2. External Brain: Lists/schedules are our external prefrontal cortex. Our brains lack this ""build-in OS""
3. Sleep Schedule: Impossible without steps 1&2 

This experience proved my brain can restructure itself. The ADHD disadvantages vanished, but the superpowers (hyperfocus) remained and became usable.

I am a younger female who will be taking her first solo trip to Costa Rica this December! I want to make the most of my trip but I am having a lot of trouble deciding what to do as I have never traveled solo before and am pretty nervous. I will be spending 7-8 days here (willing to extend to 10 days), and plan to come back to Costa Rica at some point. I need help with recommendations for main attractions to do and see for a first time trip, and what day tours/hikes are best to use, recommended hotels. I am not a huge beach gal and do not plan to go swimming this trip.

Things I like and want to do:

I love wildlife and nature and want to go on (probably guided) day hikes. 

I want to go zip lining and visit hot springs. 

I want to see what the nightlife and  dancing (Salsa, bachata, merengue, chachacha) is all about here. 

Festival de la luz (I know it is on the 13th and will plan around that).

Maybe a coffee bean tour? I loveee coffee.

I am an experienced horseback rider and would love to ride horses in the mountains or on a beach. 

I want to try some good food here if there are any special recommendations whether in San Jose or elsewhere recommended to go for a first trip.

I love yoga and would be excited to do something like that for a day or couple of days.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

She lives abroad, and regularly comes back home for a few days. She usually always tells me when and we makes plans to see each other. I knew she was coming back in October as she had previously told me. So, 2 weeks ago, i asked her when she would be here. I got no reply for a week. I texted again thinking nothing of it, it happens. Her reply was a little cold. She said she'd be here for a couple days and mostly be with  family, but that she'd let me know if she had time for a quick coffee. 

She never let me know. She is here now, and I know because I saw her instagram story of her and another friend she has here in our hometown out for dinner. Ngl i felt a little pinch in my heart. Feeling the vibe was really off, I texted her basically asking if we were ok (not aggressively at all, more like a ""i'm sorry for bothering you but i have a feeling something is off""). 

She replied the next morning saying : 

  
""Don't worry you didn't do anything wrong ! I needed some time to myself and to think about a few things and that includes friendships as well. We can talk about it someday if you want, but in the meantime please don't overthink🤍""

And let me tell you, I am absolutely overthinking it. I feel like she randomly decided to end our friendship and is letting me down gently. We have never fought, there is no conflict, we've always been there for each other, she knows she can call me in the middle of the night and I'll pick up, just a couple months ago we were discussing matching tattoos. I have no idea what is suddenly going on. 

  
If anyone has some insight I would be very thankful. I am panicking and feeling absolutely heartbroken and that I am not enough. ",3,1760709420.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

1o920f2,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1o920f2/is_it_caffeine_withdrawal_or_something_else/,Is it caffeine withdrawal or something else?,"Hello everyone,

A little background. I used to drink 2-3 cups of coffee a day, including 1-2 can of energy drink for the last few years. I am 23, so still young. I went to a vacation trip around 1,5 months ago and I did not consume any coffee at all for a whole week. It was not my intention to stop drinking coffee, I just didn’t feel like drinking for some reason on my vacation. I also barely consumed caffeine that whole week without paying attention. 

The day I came back from my vacation, I started feeling very and very light headed, as if I was gonna faint. Not only that, my heart was beating very fast as if I was gonna die. I had no idea what was going on.

I started consuming caffeine (like coffee and energy drink) as usual after my vacation trip. 3 weeks had passed and I was still feeling light headed, and feeling like my heart was beating fast. 

I went to the doctor, they checked my blood pressure, my vitamines, iron etc and all and everything was perfect, except that my vitamine D was low. Since I was young, this has always been the case, and I started taking vitamine D. I doubt low vitamine D would cause this, since I never experienced something like this before. 

And eventually I came across the idea that it might have been the 1 week of consuming barely caffeine at all and it might just have been the withdrawal symptoms. I find it weird though, because even though it could have been the “caffeine withdrawal symptoms” I consumed caffeine again after my vacation trip for another few weeks.

So since I had no idea what to do, I decided to fully quit caffeine and see how it would go. another 3 weeks has passed now without any caffeine intake. Not even cola or chocolate. And sadly I am still feeling light headed as if I am gonna faint. 

I have no idea if it is even caffeine withdrawal symptoms at this point and even if it is, is it normal to experience it for this long? Any help would be appreciated. ",1,1760709392.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

1o920a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1o920a8/ro_bandage/,[RO] Bandage,"The letter arrived unexpectedly. She hadn’t received mail in months aside from the barrage of Amazon packages stacked against her porch from her many admirers. There, on the envelope, was her name plainly written in handwriting that used to appear on greeting cards and small notes around the house, instantly recognizable. It stood out, impossible to ignore among the odd bills and non-profit solicitations for ASPCA, advertisements for home upgrades and mail order catalogs. She took it from the mail slot and carried it home like a lit stick of dynamite. 

Once inside, she walked steadily to her open-air kitchen and mixed a Tito’s and water. She moved to her couch chased by memories she had spent weeks outrunning. She sat, her faithful dachshund beside her - its skinny brown head and floppy ears resting against her knee, the envelope resting on the coffee table like it could explode. Her fingers hesitated before opening it.

She read it once - quick - like ripping off a bandage. Then again, slower the second time.
By the third read, the tears stopped threatening.

The words didn’t ask for anything. No aspersions, no anger. To her, they didn’t even sound like the man she’d once called too much. They were steady, soft, respectful, concise. No bad blood. Hope you’re doing well. She traced the edges of the paper like she could feel the intent behind each syllable, and the weight slowly lowered onto her shoulders.

In the quiet that followed, her brain flipped through a thousand stored sounds: a pair of voices singing bluegrass songs, the clink of wine glasses in the kitchen over that last weekend, an acoustic guitar faithfully recreating Blind Melon’s rendition of ‘Candy Says’. She searched for a power or pause button, something to silence the flood of sound - before realizing it was nothing but memory.

That evening, she poured herself another drink and put on an album in which she had always found solace, The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do. Halfway through the disc, she was reminded unintentionally of the letter in her drawer. Shutting her eyes, she laughed through a dull ache that built in her chest. “If I’m butter, if I’m butter, then he’s a hot knife, he makes my heart a cinemacope screen, showing the dancing bird of paradise…” she whispered, and felt the past breathe through her ribs.

She grabbed the letter, still staring back at her from her square coffee table, folded it neatly along the creases, and threw it into the same drawer where she kept old take out menus and printed recipes, as if paper and cabinets could bury a feeling. She stared at her phone for a moment, opened her Messages app and considered reaching out for the first time in fifty days. No, she thought to herself, not yet. She turned her memory off like a light switch and went to bed rigid, half proud of her restraint, half hollow, the past surrounding her bed like an exorcism.

In the morning, armor clicked into place. She pushed a mantra to herself: I’m fine. It was kind. I don’t owe him anything. 

The letter sat in the drawer for half a day before another reread, during which she rebuilt her story to stay upright. He wanted more. I needed space. He didn’t listen. That logic held for awhile, until the dam which held back the memories cracked a little. Then a deluge of small images - the cabin in the mountains, the hotel in Chicago, his eyes staring down at her as they fucked on her living room couch, the text she shouldn’t have sent. Then she’d shook her head, muttering that she’d already decided - she had already said enough.

But the mind doesn’t always obey decisions. Sometimes, it replays loops.

She considered putting it away, in the box of his old stuff that she kept underneath the bed, but before she could even take it out she was reminded of the old printed photos. It was something he did, he sent real old fashioned photographs in the mail after each one of their adventures. She could still remember one, taken at an aftershow after dancing to Grateful Dead for hours into the early morning - his suit shirt halfway unbuttoned, tie loose and akimbo, her leaning up against his shoulder, all smiles.

By the third day, she finally picked up a pen. Journaling was something she had always done intermittently, not enough to keep a faithful record but enough to have a disorganized stream of memories. Her version of dipping a toe back into the river. She wrote out all of her thoughts, every detail of the narrative she had constructed, but the words already seemed less sharp, and the recreation felt a little hollow on the page. 

To escape, she threw herself into motion: errands, music in the kitchen, an extra glass of chardonnay when the silence got loud again. By this point, Fiona was getting more plays than usual, the album spinning like a ritual she pretended not to notice. It didn’t sting anymore. It sounded like something she survived. Her body was tired in a way coffee cannot fix. She blended herself a glass of tea, posted something light to her Instagram account, and stared at reruns of Futurama on the TV. 

On day five, curiosity arrived sideways in silent streams, nothing dramatic. She wondered what his days look like now. Did he continue going to the gym? Is he still smoking? Writing? Hanging with Kelly? Making dinners for his elderly nextdoor neighbor Larry? Was he still crying for comfort against the fur of his cat?

When the sun set, she decided to cook for the first time in a month, Garlic Butter Chicken. The enticing aroma of sauteed smashed garlic and diced onions pervaded the entire house. Spinning around the kitchen, she hummed gently without realizing it, “If I’m butter, if I’m butter…” She stopped mid-note, irritated. He dauchshund stood there on the wood floor, tilting its head her head as if she knows. “Don’t look at me like that,” she muttered playfully.

At Wednesday night drinks, she sighed into her glass and looked over at her friend. “Got a letter - first I’ve heard from him in weeks…no drama though.” The friend raises an eyebrow; she shrugs, changes the subject, put another bill in the video poker machine and takes another sip. After the bars closed and everyone went home, she pulled the letter out of the drawer again and analyzed the few lines on the page.

 His handwriting looked steadier than she remembered. She hated this observation, why does it even matter. It’s a closed chapter like so many others drafted before. She reread the final line - wishing you the best out there - and it sounds like the opposite of manipulation, like love stripped of demand.

Without intending to, she reopened her messaging app and drafted another two-line reply: “Got your letter. Thank you, it was very kind.” before deleting it once more. If a memory was a room, she was standing in the doorway, hand on the frame, not crossing the threshold.

It was a week after the correspondence arrived before she sent the message. Something neutral, something brief, mirroring what she received. Something harmless. She deleted it, and drafted again:

Hey - just wanted to say thanks for the letter.
It was kind of you to send. I hope you’re doing okay.

It’s just a nothing text, why does this matter at all? The pulse in her throat gave away her true feelings no matter how much she tried to obfuscate them. She hesitated five more minutes, then hits send.  The under bubble text read Delivered and her chest filled with adrenaline and regret. Texts and letters are similar that way, once you’ve dropped them in the mailbox, there’s no turning back. In an act of anxiety, she dropped her phone on the table like a pulled pin grenade. 

	Hey you - glad it made it and good to hear you’re doing well.
	Things have been steady on my end. I appreciate hearing from you.

And then nothing more. No follow up, no litigation, no poet pouring his soul onto the digital notebook. No chasing, no flirting, no wound-licking. Just an empty silence, almost eerie in its peacefulness. She exhaled a little too loudly, causing her dachshund to look up, alarmed.She scratches the dog’s ears and whispered, “See? Not a game.” Part of her wished that he had, part of her wondered why.

When she woke up around ten, she scrolled her phone half-expecting another ping. None comes. Things seem different this time. It reminded her of when he could be so confident, back when they danced under the lights at the Tuscany, sweating through their shirts, rubbing ice on each other’s foreheads, stumbling back to their hotel room wax philosophical and play footsie under the covers. It had been natural, organic, beautiful. She thought about how long it’s been since anyone spoke to her without trying to fix her or win her over. He eventually had, he always had other intentions had been where she hid their history. But this, this felt different. 

Two days passed before she found herself staring at the reply once more. “Am I really going to send another text”, she asked herself. Just a month beforehand, she hated this man, hated how suffocated he made her feel, how frozen she was by anger and anxiety. It wasn’t so much what he had done, but moreso what he made her feel. Frustrated, afraid. And yet, here she was, punching the digital keyboard on her iPhone:

Was thinking of a song we used to overplay. You still listen to Fiona?

She stared at it. Deleted “Fiona.” Rewrote:
Heard a song that reminded me of you. Saw you got a dog - hope the new pup is keeping you busy.

She kept the message in her drafts, unsent, for another twenty four hours, hoping he’d rebreak the silence first. Nothing came.

“Fuck it,” she thought, and pressed the send button. She leashed up her dachshund and took it for a walk around the gated neighborhood. The air smelled like dust, asthma and allergies accompanied her anxiety. She didn’t expect a reply.


But by morning, there it was:
Ha - probably Fions, right? Hugo’s great. Still stealing the bed every night. Hope you and the ween are doing good too.

He always called her ‘Fions’. It used to irritate the shit out her. Now, it made her smile.  Not big, but real.
There are more messages over the next few days, brief flickers. A meme. Exchanges of photos of their puppies mid-yawn. A text about new music, half inside joke, half olive branch. They didn’t relitigate the past, no heavy subjects. Like the slow movement of tectonic plates, under the surface, something shifted - trust begins to breathe again, one small, ordinary exchange at a time. There is no rekindling the fire, just tending the embers.

Back at wasted Wednesday, her friend asks about “how everything is going with that situation”. She says, “we’re just being nice.” But when she scrolls back through your messages before bed, she knows that’s not quite true. Nice isn’t the right word. Familiar is. Alive is.

Two whole months after its arrival, the letter had found a new home a notebook in her desk drawer. She’d re-read it less often. Sometimes - not every day - they’d exchange little messages back and forth, slowly slowly rebuilding that trust again. She’d journal more frequently, letting Spotify and her thoughts stream endlessly onward, the songs surrounding her thoughts in the sweetest serenade. Until those thoughts were caught by a familiar refrain, “If I’m butter…if I’m butter”, reappearing for the first time in weeks. This time, she didn’t consider skipping or silencing it. Instead, she sang every lyric loud as possible, like the way he used to in the shower, like the way they did in the living room of the cabin near Alma.

When the song ends, she smiled at her dachshund and said,  “That’s enough butter talk for one lifetime.”

Then she closed her journal, leans back, and for the first time since August, she didn't need to rewrite the story. Just let it be what it was - brief, intense, messy, beautiful, and finally, done.

Then she smiled - small, honest - and poured herself a cup of tea.

Somewhere across the state line, a man walked a dog in the wet autumn rain. It was cold, and his jacket smelt like old cigarettes and cedar, though he no longer smoked. In the back of his mind, for just a moment, there was the faint hum of connection, an old radio picking up a familiar station after miles of static.",1,1760709381.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

“Auntie, I need to resign a month early. There’s still work to hand over, but you can arrange the rest however you see fit. I’m fine with it—sorry for the trouble.”

“Oh, you child, why so polite?”

My aunt laughed lightly on the other end of the phone, her voice cheerful, betraying no hint of concern.

The moment I hung up, I sat at my desk in silence for three seconds.

The resignation form on the table was stained with coffee, leaving a faint brown ring.

I traced that ring with my fingertip. Somehow, it looked like an old ring rusted into the skin—neither removable nor wearable.

The computer screen was still glowing when a news alert popped up:

“Z Corporation’s Executive CEO Rory attends charity gala with two children—‘Perfect Father,’ warm and devoted.”

He was in a black suit, holding a child in each arm.

His smile was gentle—his most practiced expression.

My fingers curled inch by inch as I stared at the photo.

Those two children weren’t mine.

My child had died on the operating table.

Even now, I can still hear the doctor’s urgent voice echoing in my head:

“Severe hemorrhage! We need to terminate the pregnancy immediately!”

I had shaken my head with every last ounce of strength, my throat raw:

“No…”

Then came a deep, steady voice from outside the door:

“Sign it.”



It was his voice—calm, It was him—my husband, Rory.precise, and clear as a blade.



I thought it was the doctor asking for consent.



I didn’t realize it was him signing his name in the “family authorization” column.



The baby was gone.



When he entered the ward, the first thing he said wasn’t a word of comfort, but:



“Be more careful next time.”



And then:



“This wasn’t an accident—it was the rational choice.”



From that moment, I understood—reason was his only faith.



And I was merely the believer he sacrificed to prove it.



Three years have passed, and I still hear the buzz of that surgical lamp in my dreams.



It shone so bright, yet gave no warmth.



I closed my laptop and went to the kitchen to make coffee.



The hiss of steam filled the air. I took a sip—it was bitter enough to burn.



I looked at my reflection in the glass and smiled faintly.



“Wendy, you’ve finally learned to be rational.”



The wedding photo on the wall was spotless, polished until it gleamed.



In it, I was smiling softly, my eyes still holding the innocence of that year.



He stood beside me, elegant, his hand resting naturally on my shoulder.



When the photographer said, “A little closer,” he frowned slightly and replied,



“Can we hurry? I have a meeting this afternoon.”



I nodded and smiled.



That smile was captured forever—the image of “happiness” everyone believed in.



Back in the study, I pulled out a folder from the drawer:



Property transfer papers.



Insurance.



Trust documents.



Everything neatly arranged.



My life—just the way he liked it: orderly, quiet, obedient.



My phone buzzed. It was Yuanzi.



“Wendy, are you sure about this?”



Her voice trembled. “Faking your death? Are you insane?”



“I’m not insane,” I said softly. “I’m finally awake.”



“But if he finds out.”



“Then I’ll die a second time.”



I smiled. “I’ve already died once, remember?”



There was a long silence before she sighed.



“All right. I’ll set it up. The flight, the crash simulation—everything.



But you’re sure? You won’t tell him?”



I paused for a moment, my voice almost a whisper.



“He doesn’t need to know.



To him, whether I’m dead or alive—it makes no difference.”



Night had fallen.



Chapter 2



I opened my laptop and began to write a letter.



When it was done, I folded it neatly, slipped it into an envelope, and placed it beneath my resignation form.



Then I took off my wedding ring and set it on top.



The metal was cold, its reflected light sharp enough to make me squint.



The living room lights were a sterile white.



I carried my coffee out. Rory was sitting on the sofa, long fingers turning through a stack of documents.



It was his nightly ritual—work, plans, schedules, directives. Perfect. Predictable. Unfaltering.



Without looking up, he asked evenly, “Did the application get approved?”



“Mm.”



“Resignation?” His tone didn’t change. “What for?”



“Rest.”



He paused for a moment, then curved his lips into that humorless almost-smile.



“You’re not suited for rest. When people have too much time, they tend to overthink.”



He’d said those exact words once before—



the night I lost our child.



When I came home from the hospital, he was, as usual, in his study reviewing papers.



I had stood in the doorway, trembling, my clothes still carrying the metallic tang of blood and disinfectant.



He looked up briefly and said,



“Wendy, don’t overthink. Be rational.”



Rational.



His favorite word.



I looked at his manicured nails, at the wedding band trimmed with a faint gold edge, and suddenly felt a hollow, lucid kind of grief.



He never belonged to love.



He belonged to order.



“What’s for dinner?” he asked.



“Whatever you like.”



He nodded, satisfied—as if speaking to a competent assistant.



“The charity gala tomorrow—don’t forget to prepare your outfit.”



“Okay.”



“Sybil will be there too.”



My fingers froze.



He went on casually, “She’s just returned. There’s a joint project with her foundation. The media will be there—don’t embarrass yourself.”



I lifted my gaze to that forever calm, composed face.



“She’s back?”



“Mm. I met her this afternoon.”



He added, almost as an afterthought, “She looks gentler than before.”



I smiled.



And in that instant, I understood exactly how cold his rationality was.



He could lay open an old wound at the dinner table and call it business.



After dinner, I cleared the dishes as usual.



He stood on the balcony, phone pressed to his ear, his voice low and smooth:



“Sybil, I’ve adjusted the seating for tomorrow. You’ll be beside me.”



A glass slipped from my hand and shattered across the floor.



“What happened?” he asked, turning slightly.



“Nothing.”



I knelt to pick up the shards.



A sliver cut my fingertip—blood welled and dripped, bright against the white tile.



He frowned, fetched the first-aid kit from the cabinet, and said in that same flat tone,



“You’re always like this.”



He dressed the wound deftly.



“Next time, don’t lose focus,” he added, as if reprimanding an employee.



The smell of antiseptic burned my nose, and I suddenly laughed.



He looked up. “What’s so funny?”



“Nothing.”



I shook my head.



It just struck me—this life of mine felt more like death than death itself.



Night deepened.



After his shower, he came out with a towel hanging loosely at his waist.



I pretended to be asleep.



He lifted the blanket and lay down beside me, his skin carrying that faint, cool scent of soap and fatigue.



He wrapped an arm around my waist out of habit—his touch as cold as the aftertaste of a drink at a business dinner.



“Wendy,” he murmured near my ear, “don’t quit your job on a whim again.”



“Okay.”



“Be rational.”



He closed his eyes.



I stared at the ceiling and quietly counted my breaths—



one, two, three—



until he fell asleep.



And in that moment, I knew.



I was leaving.



Not because I hated him.



But because I finally refused to keep living as his version of rational.



Chapter 3



The morning light was a cold white.



When I woke, the bed beside me was already empty.



Before leaving, Rory had—like every morning—left behind his three daily sentences:



“Breakfast is on the table. Don’t be late. Be rational.”



Be rational.



He loved those three words more than he had ever loved me.



I sat at the table for a long time, slowly finishing the glass of milk that had already gone cold.



Outside, I heard the car door close, and his silver Bentley eased down the driveway.



Silence swallowed the house, thick and eerie.



And in that moment, I felt—strangely free.



I went back to the study, intending to tidy up the documents he’d left out from the night before.



Among the neatly stacked folders, there was one that was thicker than the rest, marked with his personal seal.



I opened it without much thought and froze.



“Authorization for Termination of Pregnancy.”



My hands began to tremble.



The handwriting was unmistakably his—firm, precise, confident.



Family signature: Rory.



My breath caught. I could almost hear again the buzz of the surgical lamp from that day—



the doctor’s urgent voice,



the nurse’s hands pressing down on my shoulders,



and that low, steady voice from outside the door:



“Sign it.”



It hit me all at once.



From beginning to end,



what he signed that day wasn’t consent to save my life it was consent to let our child die.



I didn’t even know how I ended up sitting down.



The paper gleamed pale under the sunlight, almost translucent.



And in that light, my entire world collapsed.



The doorbell rang.



I rose slowly and went to open it.



The woman standing outside wore a beige trench coat, her long hair falling smoothly over her shoulders.



She smiled—gentle, graceful, polished.



“Mrs. wendy,” she said softly. “It’s me—Sybil.”



For a second, I just stared.



She reached out her hand, her smile unwavering.



“Rory asked me to bring over some contracts. He’s been busy, so he asked me to deliver them.”



I stepped aside to let her in.



Her heels clicked softly on the floor; her perfume was faint but deliberate.



Her gaze drifted over the desk—



and stopped on the document.



“You’ve read it?” she asked, still smiling.



Then, almost tenderly: “That day… I was the one who brought it to the doctor.”



I looked up. “What?”



She tilted her head slightly, voice light as if recounting someone else’s tragedy.



“You were bleeding badly. The doctor said they needed the family’s signature. Rory hesitated for a long time outside, so I took him the form.”



Her tone didn’t waver.



“He didn’t even read it. Just signed.



He said, ‘She’s rational. She’ll understand.’”



The air seemed to thin, the sound drained from the room.



I stayed upright only through sheer willpower.



Sybil smiled faintly, her voice soft as silk:



“Don’t blame him. He didn’t want you to suffer. That child… was never meant to stay.”



I laughed.



The sound surprised even me.



“So,” I asked quietly, “did you come here to comfort me—or to prove you understand him better than I ever did?”



She paused, then sighed gently.

1o91ww3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o91ww3,Pumpkin bread,"We're in the middle of pumpkin season, and from October to January, the harvest of this fruit allows us to have an abundance of this noble, inexpensive, nutritious, and versatile ingredient. Taking advantage of the fact that we bought woods pumpkins at home, which are a variety with firmer flesh and better flavor, I wanted to make a bread recipe.

# THE RECIPE 



**Time, ingredients and equipment**



* Preparation time: This recipe is long, as I usually like to let it rise for at least 15 hours when I make bread, so you'll need to start it in advance.
* Servings: Two loaves of approximately 350 grams each.

**The ingredient quantities listed below can be varied according to availability and individual taste, although I recommend maintaining the same proportions of flour and liquids.**

* 500 grams of wheat flour. I used pastry flour or 0000.
* 100 grams of wheat flour, set aside, to be added after the initial fermentation.
* 200 grams of pumpkin puree (preferably ripe).
* Approximately 150 ml of ginger, which will replace the yeast and help ferment the dough.
* 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
* 1 teaspoon of ground ginger.
* 120 ml of cane molasses. If you don't have cane molasses, you can use the sweetener to your liking. For example, I used the liquid from a papaya jam I had in the fridge. You can also make a thick panela syrup.
* 100 grams of white sugar.
* 1 tablespoon of white sugar (to sprinkle on the loaves before baking).
* 2 tablespoons of chopped peanuts.
* 2 heaped tablespoons of pumpkin seeds (toasted).
* 2 tablespoons of flaxseeds.
* 250 ml (approximately) of boiled or filtered water, at room temperature.
* 100 ml of vegetable oil, whatever you have at home.
* Oil to apply to your hands before making the loaves.
* Bowl, cups, teaspoon, plate, knife, baking pans, wax paper, etc.



# THE PROCEDURE

Remove the pumpkin seeds. Remove the surrounding fiber and toast them over low heat, stirring occasionally, until all the seeds are well toasted. Remove the pumpkin skin, chop the flesh into small cubes, place in a pot, cover with water, and cook over medium-high heat until very soft. Strain and puree. Reserve.



In a large bowl, combine the flour with the cinnamon, ground ginger, peanuts, and pumpkin seeds (both ground). Stir to distribute evenly.

  
Next, add the molasses to the bowl, then the ginger bug, both the liquid and the ginger pieces. Add the oil, then the pumpkin puree and the ground peanuts and pumpkin seeds. Knead until smooth. You'll have a sandy dough.

Add the water little by little, while continuing to knead for five minutes. You'll end up with a moist dough, which is necessary for the ginger bug to do its work of fermenting the dough. Cover the dough with a cloth or place it in a container and let it ferment outside the refrigerator for at least 15 hours. NOTE: In the photos, the dough looks somewhat dry, and this is because I only added 50 ml of ginger bug, then added the other 100 ml.

The next day, deflate the dough. As you can see in the photos, this dough rose so much that it spilled out of the container it was in. You can also see the beautiful fermentation that occurred. After deflating it, knead it and gradually add the white sugar, as well as the remaining flour.

Deflate the dough again, flatten and fold it four times, cover, and let it rise for another 40 minutes. After this time, the dough will have risen even more.

After this time, divide the dough in half. Add the flax seeds evenly. Shape each loaf into a ball. Since I wanted each loaf to resemble a round pumpkin, I cut a thick cotton thread, joining it in the center, creating eight strands. I placed this skein of thread on top of the waxed paper. Then, I placed the loaf in the dough and tied these threads over it, leaving them somewhat loose so that the dough would take on a proper shape as it rose. NOTE: Flax seeds are added at the end, before baking, because adding them earlier makes the dough bitter.

Let it rise again for 30 minutes. After this time, sprinkle with a little white sugar (you can also brush with molasses) and place in a preheated oven at 220°C (420°F). Place a tray of water underneath to create a humid environment inside the oven. Bake for 20 minutes, then remove the tray of water and bake for another 30 to 40 minutes. Once the baking time is up, place the loaves on a wire rack to prevent condensation from forming underneath. Wait for them to cool.

Once the loaves are cool, remove the strings. I don't think it's a good idea to add these strings because they leave a lot of fiber clinging to the loaves. Therefore, it's better to cut slits in the dough to give them a pumpkin shape. Pierce the top with a knife and insert a piece of cinnamon to accentuate the pumpkin look

Making these breads was a sensory experience. From the beginning, the pleasant scent of spices and pumpkin filled the house. When it fermented overnight, it already gave off a delicious aroma, which intensified during baking. Since I used ginger bug to help the dough rise, it's a very light bread, suitable for those who have trouble digesting regular bread. You could say it's similar to a bread made with sourdough. The smell, the taste, and the texture of both the crust and the crumb are wonderful. It's a very tasty, semi-sweet bread that can be eaten alone or accompanied by a drink, such as a nice glass of lemonade or coffee. I'm really happy with the result. Enjoy!

**NEW YORK** \- As the US government shutdown drags on, New Yorkers are expressing concern over programs being shut down and services being cut. Below are tips on how to survive the shutdown.



**1. Understand What Happens in a Government Shutdown**



Let’s start with the basics — what *actually* happens when the U.S. government “shuts down”?



A shutdown isn’t like turning off the lights in Washington; it’s more like putting half the government on pause because Congress couldn’t agree on a spending plan. 



Each year, lawmakers have to pass funding bills to keep federal agencies running. When they don’t — boom — the money stops flowing, and most agencies have to close or scale way back until funding is restored.



Here’s where it gets tricky: not everyone in the government goes home. Some employees are labeled “essential”, meaning their work is considered critical to public safety or national security — think air traffic controllers, border patrol, or the military. These people still have to show up to work, even though their paychecks might be delayed until the shutdown ends.



Everyone else — often hundreds of thousands of people — is furloughed, which is basically unpaid leave. You’re told not to come in, not to check email, and to just wait. It’s stressful, especially when bills don’t stop just because the government did.



Meanwhile, everyday services that rely on federal funding start to feel the pinch.



* National parks close or limit access.



* Passport and visa processing slows to a crawl.



* The IRS might delay refunds or freeze customer service lines.



* Federal grant money, research programs, and small business loans all get stuck in limbo.



Some programs, like Social Security, Medicare, and mail delivery, keep going — they’re funded differently and aren’t affected by these budget battles. But for a lot of people, especially federal workers and contractors, a shutdown means uncertainty, delayed income, and a lot of waiting.



The bottom line? A shutdown doesn’t mean the government disappears — it just goes into crisis mode. Knowing which services are affected (and which aren’t) helps you plan ahead and stay calm while the political storm passes.



**2. Protect Your Finances**



When a government shutdown hits, the first question most people ask is, *“How am I supposed to pay my bills?”*



It’s a fair question — and the good news is, there are smart ways to stay afloat while the paychecks are on pause.



Let’s be honest: you can’t control when Congress decides to fund the government again, but you *can* control how you manage your money in the meantime. The goal is to stretch what you have, avoid unnecessary debt, and keep your essentials covered until things get back on track.



**Start with a “bare-bones” budget**



This is your financial emergency mode. Focus on what truly matters: housing, food, utilities, transportation, and medication.  
Press pause on non-essentials — dining out, new gadgets, subscriptions you barely use — anything that doesn’t help you get through the month. If it doesn’t feed you, shelter you, or keep the lights on, it can wait.



**Talk to your lenders before things get tight**



Many banks, credit unions, and credit card companies *expect* to hear from federal workers during shutdowns — and a lot of them actually offer special relief programs.

  
You might be able to skip or delay payments, avoid late fees, or temporarily lower your interest rate. The key is to reach out early, before you miss a payment. It’s a lot easier to negotiate when you’re proactive.



**Use your emergency fund strategically**



If you’ve built up an emergency fund — great job, this is exactly what it’s for.

That said, don’t drain it all at once. Use it for essentials only, and plan to rebuild it once back pay arrives (most shutdowns do include back pay for federal employees, though not always for contractors).



**Avoid high-interest debt if possible**



It’s tempting to reach for the credit card or take out a quick loan to bridge the gap, but interest piles up fast. If you *must must borrow*, try to use lower-cost options — like a personal loan from your credit union or a 0% APR credit card — rather than payday or cash advance loans.



**Check if you qualify for unemployment**



If you’re a furloughed contractor, you might actually qualify for unemployment benefits in your state. Federal employees typically don’t (because they’re expected to get back pay later), but contractors often can — and that can make a big difference in covering bills.



The bottom line: this is a time to be resourceful, not fearful. A shutdown is stressful, no doubt about it, but most people who plan ahead and communicate early with lenders make it through without major long-term damage.



Think of it like financial triage — stabilize now, patch what you can, and rebuild when the checks start rolling again.



**3. Manage Everyday Needs**



When the government shuts down, life doesn’t stop — you still need to eat, pay bills, and take care of your family. This is where things can feel the most frustrating, especially if your paycheck is delayed. But with a little planning and some creative thinking, you can keep your essentials covered without panicking.



**Let’s start with food.**



If you rely on SNAP benefits or other federal food assistance, you might still receive them for a short time even during a shutdown — but if the closure drags on, payments could get delayed.

  
That doesn’t mean you need to fill your pantry like it’s the apocalypse, but it’s smart to stock up modestly on affordable staples — rice, beans, pasta, canned goods, frozen vegetables. The goal is to make your food stretch, not to clear out the grocery store.



Also, don’t overlook local help. Food banks, churches, and community centers often expand their services during shutdowns, especially in areas with lots of federal workers. There’s no shame in accepting help when you need it — that’s what these programs are for.



**Next up: healthcare.**



The good news is that most healthcare programs continue running even if the government isn’t fully funded.

* Medicare and Medicaid keep operating.



* VA hospitals and clinics stay open.



* If your insurance comes through your federal job, your coverage should continue — but double-check to make sure your premiums are still being deducted properly once pay resumes.



If you need to fill prescriptions, try to get a 90-day supply of any essentials if possible, or ask your pharmacist if they can extend medication until your insurance payments catch up.



**Don’t forget childcare.**



This one can sneak up on families. Some federally funded childcare programs — like Head Start centers — may have to close or cut hours during a shutdown. If you rely on one of those programs, it’s smart to have a backup plan in place, whether that’s a relative, a friend, or a local daycare that can temporarily step in.



If you’re part of a parenting or neighborhood group, this is also a great time to share resources — babysitting swaps, carpools, or meal exchanges can take a lot of pressure off everyone.



**Other essentials**



Utilities, phone bills, transportation — all the usual suspects still expect to be paid. This is where your “bare-bones” budget from Section 2 really helps. If you can, contact your utility providers to ask about hardship programs or flexible payment plans. Many of them quietly offer help during shutdowns; you just have to ask.



**The bottom line?**

  
A government shutdown may cause chaos in D.C., but your daily life doesn’t have to unravel with it. Keep your focus on the basics — food, health, and family — and tap into local and community support when you need to. You’re not alone in this, and with a little planning, you can ride out the uncertainty without letting it take over your everyday life.



**4. Plan for Service Delays**



One of the most annoying parts of a government shutdown isn’t always the missed paycheck — it’s the waiting. Things that normally move at a steady pace suddenly slow down or stop altogether. And while that’s frustrating, a little planning (and patience) can save you a lot of headaches.



Let’s walk through what to expect.



Taxes: same deadlines, slower everything



Yes, you still have to file your taxes during a shutdown — the IRS doesn’t take a vacation.

  
But here’s the catch: refunds and customer service can be delayed if staff are furloughed. That means if you’re expecting money back, it might take longer to arrive.



If possible, file electronically — that usually helps speed things up a bit — and make sure all your documents are in order to avoid extra delays once things reopen.



**Travel plans? Brace for bureaucracy.**



If you’re planning a trip abroad, get ready for some potential headaches.



Passport and visa processing often slow to a crawl during a shutdown because the offices that handle them operate with reduced staff. Some locations might even close temporarily.



If your passport is about to expire or you need a new one, handle it early — don’t wait until the last minute. And if you’re already traveling soon, check the State Department’s website regularly for updates.



TSA and air traffic controllers are considered essential, so airports stay open, but long lines and low morale can be part of the deal since many of those workers aren’t being paid during the shutdown.



**Small business owners and researchers, take note**



If you depend on federal grants, SBA loans, or research funding, those programs typically freeze until the government reopens. Applications stop moving, approvals stall, and funding can’t be released.



If that’s you, now’s the time to pause big spending decisions and keep communication open with your contacts or program officers. Once funding resumes, there’s usually a big backlog — so be prepared for a slow restart.



The good news: some things keep running

Not everything grinds to a halt. Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid payments keep going out — those programs are funded separately.

  
Same with the U.S. Postal Service — your mail will still show up, even if it’s a few minutes late.



**Bottom line**



During a shutdown, patience becomes a survival skill. The best move is to get ahead of anything that involves the federal government — whether that’s renewing a passport, filing taxes, or applying for benefits.



Think of it as weathering a storm: you can’t control when it passes, but you *can* make sure your house (and paperwork) are in order when the clouds clear.



**5. Use Community Support**



When the government shuts down, it’s easy to feel like you’re on your own — but you’re really not. Across the country, communities step up in big and small ways to help people get through the uncertainty. Whether it’s your local credit union offering payment relief or a neighbor dropping off groceries, there’s a surprising amount of support out there once you know where to look.



Let’s talk about where to start.



Lean on local resources



If your paycheck’s on pause, don’t wait until things get desperate to ask for help. Many local organizations are ready for situations exactly like this.



* Food banks, churches, and community centers often set up special distributions for federal workers and contractors.



* Some local businesses and restaurants even offer free meals or discounts during shutdowns.



* And credit unions (especially ones serving government employees) frequently offer short-term, low- or no-interest loans to help bridge the gap until back pay arrives.



It’s not charity — it’s community. You’ve spent years contributing taxes and public service; now it’s okay to let others lend a hand while things get sorted out.



**Check for special programs**



During longer shutdowns, many big organizations — from utility companies to mortgage lenders — roll out temporary assistance programs. These can include deferred payments, no late fees, or flexible payment plans.

  
It’s worth a few phone calls or website visits to see what’s available. Often, they don’t advertise these programs loudly; you just have to ask.



Unions and employee associations can be lifesavers

If you’re a member of a union or professional association, reach out to them early. They’re usually on top of the latest updates about relief funds, legal rights, and benefit options. Some even organize food drives or emergency grants specifically for members affected by shutdowns.



Even if you’re not currently active in your union, now’s a great time to connect. They’ve helped people through this before — they’ll know what to do.



**Neighbors helping neighbors**



Sometimes the most meaningful help doesn’t come from an organization at all. It’s a friend offering to watch your kids for a few hours. It’s a neighbor sharing extra groceries. It’s coworkers trading tips on which credit unions are being the most flexible.



Shutdowns are tough, but they also remind us that community still matters — that people look out for each other when things get hard.



The takeaway



You don’t have to tough it out alone. Between local charities, financial institutions, unions, and the kindness of neighbors, there are plenty of safety nets to catch you while Washington sorts itself out.



Asking for help isn’t weakness — it’s wisdom. The people around you *want* to help; sometimes they’re just waiting for you to reach out.



**6. Take Care of Your Mental Health**



Let’s be real — a government shutdown doesn’t just mess with your paycheck. It messes with your peace of mind. The uncertainty, the waiting, the constant news updates — it all takes a toll. You might feel frustrated, anxious, or even angry, and that’s completely normal.



When your routine gets thrown off and money feels tight, stress can sneak up fast. So, just as you’re taking care of your finances and daily needs, it’s just as important to take care of *you.*



Acknowledge what you’re feeling



First things first: don’t beat yourself up for feeling stressed or upset. This situation is hard. Even people who seem calm on the outside are probably feeling it, too.

  
Sometimes, just saying out loud, *“Yeah, this is really stressful,”* can be grounding. It gives you permission to deal with the emotions instead of pretending they’re not there.



Stick to a routine

Shutdowns can make your schedule feel out of control — especially if you’re furloughed and not working. Creating a daily routine helps bring back a sense of structure and normalcy.



* Wake up and go to bed at consistent times.



* Eat real meals (not just snacks and coffee).



* Get outside or move your body every day, even if it’s just a walk around the block.



It sounds simple, but routine helps keep your brain from slipping into that “everything is chaos” mindset.



Stay connected

It’s tempting to isolate yourself when you’re stressed or embarrassed about money — but that only makes things harder.

  
Reach out to coworkers, friends, or family members who get it. Many federal employees and contractors have been through shutdowns before, and they’ll understand exactly what you’re dealing with.



Sometimes just venting over coffee or swapping tips on how to stretch your budget can make you feel less alone.



Use available support programs

Most federal agencies have Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) that offer free, confidential counseling. Even if you’re furloughed, you often still have access. If you’re not a federal worker, look for community counseling centers telehealth services that charge on a sliding scale.

Don’t wait until you’re at a breaking point — talking to someone early can make a huge difference.



**Limit the doom-scrolling**



It’s easy to get stuck refreshing news feeds, hoping for updates from Congress — but that constant drip of uncertainty only makes the anxiety worse.

  
Try setting boundaries: check the news once or twice a day, then step away. Replace that screen time with something that recharges you — a hobby, a workout, a good book, or just some quiet time.



Remember, this will end



Every shutdown *does* end. It might not feel like it when you’re in the middle of it, but it always does. The paychecks return, the offices reopen, and life starts to feel normal again.



Until then, give yourself permission to slow down, ask for help, and take care of your mental well-being. You can’t control the politics — but you can protect your peace.

Once she is latched, she will calm down and feed.

I'm Her Only Close Person and I Don't Know What to Do,"My friend is severely mentally ill, lost all her money, and is in debt. How can I help her? She refuses all help.

Throwaway account for privacy.

I don't know what to do anymore and I'm desperate for any advice. This is about my friend, let's call her Julia.

We went to school together, lost touch for a while, and then through mutual acquaintances, I found out she was being severely bullied. In 2021, I reached out to her and we became close friends. I supported her through everything, helped her get into college, and things were looking up... until 2022.

In 2022, her mother died from epilepsy. She had a seizure on a bus, hit her head hard, and died in the hospital. At that moment, at just 18 years old, Julia was left completely alone. She has no living relatives except for two younger brothers (2 and 8), but custody was granted to her mother's ex-husband (I'll call him her stepfather).

Right after her mother's death, Julia immediately went and slept with her boyfriend because, as she said, ""the apartment is free now anyway."" I was shocked by this behavior, but I chalked it up to a strange stress response to grief and didn't say anything.

After that, things just got worse every year. This winter, I realized it was really bad.

*   She never leaves her house.
*   She never goes to the mall because she's terrified of people.
*   She talks very quietly, so quietly that even I can't always hear her.
*   She developed strange nervous tics. The first time I noticed was during the New Year holidays. We were walking down the street, drinking coffee, and suddenly she just let out a very loud, strange scream and shuddered so hard she spilled my coffee all over my jacket. I was in shock, asking what was wrong, but she couldn't even explain. I thought something scared her, but she couldn't clarify, so I blamed it on her epilepsy.
*   She started often telling me about hearing voices in her apartment. Once, while I was visiting her and sitting quietly drawing (the TV was off, it was silent), she ran up to me and started screaming at me to ""shut my damn mouth.""

The breaking point with a friend:

At the end of winter, I convinced her to try to socialize, thinking she was going crazy from being home alone all the time. I introduced her to my friend, ""E."" E is a good guy, from a well-off family with a stable job. For Julia, who had little money left from her mother's inheritance and had never worked a day in her life due to her mental health, he seemed like a perfect match.

One evening, we had a sleepover at E's apartment, ordered pizza, had some beer. I saw they were getting along surprisingly well, so I decided to leave them alone and went home. The next morning, I got a bunch of voice messages from E saying it was a complete shitshow and that Julia needed to be in a psych ward. (For context: she is a very beautiful girl, and you can't tell anything is wrong at first glance).

He didn't want to talk about it and just ignored me, which is unlike him. I asked Julia, and to my surprise, she was thrilled with how the night went. She said they had a sweet, heartfelt conversation, then had sex, and she really liked it. In the morning, E called her a taxi and she went home. I was shocked and confused by the completely different reactions.

A couple of days later, E finally told me what happened: during sex, Julia started screaming at him, kicking him, and practically beating him. He stopped because he thought she was uncomfortable. Then she started talking about her mother dying and having no money, which he took as a hint for money, so he called her a taxi. She tried to contact him a few more times, but he didn't respond.

Things escalated this spring:

*   Hallucinations worsened: Besides auditory hallucinations, she now has visual ones. She started thinking a demon possessed her TV because the red light on it was blinking at night.
*   Animal abuse: She threw her cat out on the street because it was ""ANNOYING"" her, even though the poor kitten was just lying on her lap. She thought it was possessed by demons too.
*   My intervention: After the cat incident, I told her she needed to see a psychiatrist and go to the hospital for evaluation, suggesting it could be schizophrenia, at minimum. She screamed at me and blocked me for a month.

A month later, I found out from her stepfather that she had another serious epileptic seizure, fell, and cut her head on a piece of glass. I called her from a different number to see how she was and if she needed help. She said she was busy because she was on a video call in a messenger app with the Central Bank of Russia. I was shocked. I told her that the Central Bank doesn't handle personal accounts and asked why she was even talking to them on Messenger. She didn't care, told me to fuck off, and blocked me again.

A couple of weeks later, she unblocked me, and I found out she had lost her entire inheritance of $20,000 to a scam. When I tried to talk to her about it, she told me to fuck off again and said I was yelling at her for no reason.

The current situation:

Now she is left with no parents, no relatives at all, and about $2,000 in credit card debt. She works a low-paying job, earning no more than $300 a month. Debt collectors and banks call her daily, threatening to take her apartment. But she's so out of it that she doesn't care. She just lives like this, doesn't try to find a better job, and spends her money on crap without even trying to pay down her debts.

I am desperate for advice.

1.  What can I do in this situation?
2.  Is it possible to have her declared legally incompetent so the banks can't pressure her so much?
3.  I think if she saw a neurologist for her epilepsy, she could get a disability status and receive benefits. But again, she doesn't want to do anything.

Please, any advice would be appreciated. I'm watching my childhood friend completely fall apart.

TL;DR: My 21-year-old friend, who has epilepsy, lost her mother and is now completely alone. Her mental state has severely deteriorated (hallucinations, tics, paranoia, likely schizophrenia). She lost her $20k inheritance to a scam, is in $2k debt, and works a low-wage job. She refuses all help. Debt collectors are threatening to take her apartment. I don't know how to help her",1,1760708821.0,u_Spare_Spend_1307,0,1.0,False

I'm a 25F from India finally taking my first big solo trip to Europe, and I'll be based in Munich from November 28th to December 9th.

My original plans fell through, so I'm excited to explore the city and surrounding areas on my own terms. I thought it would be more fun to connect with fellow travelers or friendly locals along the way!

A bit about me: I'm easygoing, love photography, trying new foods, and exploring historical sites. I'm really excited to experience the German Christmas markets, drink glühwein, and maybe take a day trip to Neuschwanstein Castle or Salzburg.

What I'm looking for:

· Someone to explore the Munich Christmas markets with (I need a partner for the glühwein and pretzels!).
· Join a free walking tour together.
· Team up for a day trip outside the city.
· Or just grab a coffee or a beer.

Even if it's just for a few hours, it would be great to have some company. If you're a solo traveler, a couple, or a local who doesn't mind showing a visitor around, let me know!

Feel free to DM me or comment below if you'll be in the area around those dates.

1o91mng,https://tipstor.com/old-school-seafood-counters-in-san-francisco-usa/,"Old-School Seafood Counters in San Francisco, USA","San Francisco wears its grit and charm like a leather jacket that’s been through a few storms but still fits just right. The city’s air carries a cocktail of salt, sourdough, and sea breeze that cuts straight through pretense. Down by the water, among the fog and the clang of fishing boats, sits the old-school seafood counter. A relic of simpler times, still alive and unapologetically loud. This is where oysters meet attitude, and cold beer becomes a religion.

The counter hums with energy. Locals and travelers elbow for space, the smell of brine and fried calamari thick in the air. The oysters are shucked with the speed of a card trick, each one a tiny ocean. Cold, clean, and slightly defiant. There’s no soft lighting or curated playlists here, just the sound of clinking glasses and the kind of sarcasm that’s served sharper than the knives behind the bar. The staff doesn’t coddle. They banter, mock, and pour beer with the precision of priests administering communion.

Adventure in San Francisco doesn’t stop at the counter. The best season to come is fall, when the fog lifts just enough to reveal the city’s curves and colors. It’s when you can wander from the seafood shacks of Fisherman’s Wharf to the murals of the Mission, each corner humming with life. Take a cable car up Nob Hill for views that look like paintings, or rent a bike and push across the Golden Gate Bridge. The wind, salt, and adrenaline conspiring to make you feel alive in a way coffee never could.

When hunger calls again, follow it to Chinatown, where dumplings steam in bamboo baskets and roasted ducks hang like trophies. Or drift into North Beach, the city’s Italian heart, for linguine tangled with clams and white wine that could make a cynic weep. San Francisco rewards curiosity. The kind that leads you down alleys and into bars that haven’t changed in fifty years.

As the sun drops behind the Pacific, the city transforms. Neon flickers to life, jazz leaks from basement doors, and the scent of sourdough bread drifts up from the wharf like a promise. The seafood counter keeps working through it all. More beer, more oysters, more laughter echoing off the tile. It’s a ritual that never gets old, one part sustenance, one part rebellion.

San Francisco doesn’t try to seduce. It challenges. It asks for your attention, your appetite, and your sense of humor. And for those who show up hungry and open, it gives back with flavors that sting, stories that stick, and moments that taste unmistakably like the sea.

White clouds turned gray—
they began moving to nature’s rhythm.

Perception grew to rain.
Underneath it all—a small city filled with life.

During this time of year,
rain can be a scary sight—
especially when you have no roof
to help you sleep at night.

There are many of us without enough shelter.
It’s not like the Man will provide cover for the down and outs.
But hey—there is goodness hidden
in a world with so much sin.

I walk down the cold street
with thoughts of warmth, good food, and a soft bed.
Not everyone out here has that option.
A lot of us have no one,
and most of us deserve it.

But the place I’m heading?
It’s a home to everyone who needs it,
rain or shine.

But it’s only open
when the devils and angels are away.
And lucky for me—it’s Tuesday.

Its windows are stained beautiful,
with walls painted in love.
A room filled with benches and chairs.
There’s a cross, a candle,
and an old man’s statue staring everyone down.

Some call this a church—
a place to have faith.
But this is my second home,
an escape from the world.

It’s not because I find God
or salvation from sin.
I don’t really believe in any of that.
Those ideas are saved for people with hope.
No—no God.
This story isn’t about Him.

This is about my dear friend Jim.
He’s the true father to the weary,
for I am tired,
and he’ll let me in.


---

Knock, knock.

“Hey kid, what are you doing out here in the blistering cold?
Come inside, come inside.
I just cleaned the church,
and I’ve got coffee brewing—it’ll keep you warm.
You hungry?
Sara made me a big lunch for my shift tonight.
You want a slice?
Anyway, you stay here tonight as long as you need, okay?
Tomorrow’s a bright day.”

Those were the words of a man who had lost it all.
Society forced him into a corner—
but he made the best of it.

Instead of coming to find Christ,
I come to find him.
The man in the church window.

He cleans up the church’s sin
at night.

Contracts. Privacy rules. “Terms and Conditions.” One wrong clause, and suddenly you’re neck-deep in lawyer bills or compliance headaches you didn’t even know existed.

That’s why we put Legal & Compliance near the top of the AI must-have list. Not because it’s fun (it’s not), but because **this is where AI can save you the most money and stress**.

We've tried them all, and here’s what we recommend — and when.

# For Startups & Early-Stage SMBs: Keep It Simple, Keep It Safe

**🧾 Legislate or Ironclad-** These tools automatically generate contracts, check your clauses for risky language, and flag compliance issues before they ever reach a lawyer’s desk.

* **Savings:** Expect to save **$1,000–$2,500 per contract** in legal review fees.
* **Best for:** Freelancers, agencies, or first-time business owners tired of paying lawyers to copy-paste templates.
* **Why it works:** You can generate contracts in minutes, not days, and still stay legally sound.

# For Growing SMBs: One Dashboard, All Your Deals

**📑 Juro-** As your business grows, you’ll have more contracts than coffee cups — clients, vendors, employees. Juro brings them all into one clean dashboard, complete with approval workflows and e-signatures.

* **Savings:** Around **$5,000–$10,000 per year** in admin hours and outsourced legal costs.
* **Best for:** Companies scaling to 10–50 employees or managing multiple partnerships.
* **Why it works:** You get a bird’s-eye view of every contract, renewal date, and legal commitment without chasing PDFs across five inboxes.

# For Mature SMBs: Sleep Easy on Privacy and Compliance

**🔒 Termly or CookieYes-** Privacy laws aren’t just for big tech anymore. If your website collects emails, cookies, or customer data, you’re legally on the hook. These tools create and update your privacy policies, cookie banners, and data collection disclosures automatically.

* **Savings:** About **$2,000–$5,000 per year** versus paying developers or lawyers to manage compliance updates.
* **Best for:** Established SMBs that want peace of mind and automated compliance tracking.
* **Why it works:** Every time privacy laws change, your settings and policies update — without a single billable hour.

# Bottom Line

AI isn’t replacing your lawyer — it’s replacing **busywork** and **billable hours**. Every one of these tools keeps you legal without you needing to sound like a lawyer. That’s what The GrowTank is here for: We assess what fits, set it up, train your people, and keep it current — so you can keep doing what actually makes you money.

but over time, I stopped treating debugging as a panic mode and started seeing it as detective work. here’s what changed everything for me:

1. Stop guessing — start isolating
Instead of rewriting half the codebase, I now break things down line by line. Find where it breaks, not why — the why comes after.

2. Add intentional logs (not spam)
I used to console.log everything. now I log strategically — inputs, outputs, and state changes. the goal is to see the story, not the noise.

3. reproduce it reliably
If I can’t reproduce the bug twice, i can’t fix it once. every time I find a way to trigger it consistently, I’m halfway there.

4. walk away when stuck
some of my best “fixes” happened after grabbing a coffee or taking a short walk. Debugging isn’t just mental—it’s patience training.

5. use AI as your debugging buddy
Sometimes I paste the function into ChatGPT/Blackbox and say “find what’s dumb here.” It often spots logic gaps faster than my brain does after 3 hours.

now debugging feels less like chaos and more like solving a mystery  minus the crime scene.

# A Drop of Sunshine 

Fritz had made this walk before, up cracked driveways, past neglected lawns, to doors that opened on exhausted faces. The briefcase felt heavier each time. He'd tried quitting twice. Both times he'd ended up back at the office within a month, needing the money more than he needed peace of mind.

His scarred, hairy knuckles rapped on a peeling yellow door. A man with sallow skin and eyes blackened by lack of sleep answered.

The man's jaw clenched. ""Can I help you?""

Fritz smiled and gripped his faded leather briefcase. ""Morning. The name's Fritz. I'm from Sunny Dreams. I'm here about Damon. Is it a bad time?""

The man disappeared behind the door, and it opened wider.

Fritz crossed the threshold. Dust gathered against dull red baseboards. A few bars of light illuminated the darkened room.

The man dropped onto a sofa. Sweat made his plaid shirt cling to his thin frame. Several curios lined the mantlepiece. In the center sat a photo in a tarnished silver frame. A boy with a gleaming smile and rosy cheeks was between two parents radiating pride.

Fritz smiled. ""Thank you, sir. I take it you're Damon's father?""

The man's head dipped.

""Terrific. So did you read the brochure, or shall I give you the whole spiel?""

""I read it."" His voice was hoarse.

Fritz scratched the back of his neck, fingers brushing silver hairs. ""Darn, guess I'll skip the sales pitch. Makes me sad, I was practicing all morning.""

Fritz paused for effect. Nothing. The man stared at him. The salesman always tried to introduce levity into these situations. It never worked.

Fritz cleared his throat. ""Do you have any questions, mister…?""

""Bill."" His voice cracked. ""Can you really dream anything you want?""

""You certainly can."" Fritz set his briefcase on the coffee table and opened it. A manila folder sat at the bottom. A grey ceramic bottle painted with a shining sun was held against the lid with black straps.

""This is Liquid Sunshine."" Fritz motioned toward the bottle. ""One drop on the temple, and you can dream anything you want. Vivid as real life. For a whole year.""

""How vividly?""

""You'll think you're really there.""

Bill chewed his cheek. ""Know a guy that used it. Said it could help you forget. Does it do that?""

Fritz blanched. He never liked to hear that question. ""Not quite. The dreams are vivid, but you'll always know they're dreams. You won't be in so deep you'll forget to eat or anything like that.""

Damon's father didn't respond. Fritz reached toward the manila folder with a beefy, wrinkled hand. ""I have a few testimonials here if you'd like to see.""

Bill took the papers Fritz handed him and looked them over. His eyes slowly glided over each page.

""You don't see anything unless you want to,"" he whispered.

""Yep, in and out at any time.""

Bill stared hard at the testimonial again, as if trying to read lines that weren't there. He then slowly craned his head upward and looked at the photo on the mantlepiece. His cracked lips curved upward.

Fritz looked at the picture and then to Bill. He cleared his throat. ""Mighty fine family."" 

The words tasted like ash. How many times had he said that exact phrase? In how many dim rooms?

""I'll take it.""

Fritz didn't speak for a beat. ""Your son. You might want to talk to him about—""

""I'll take it."" Bill's harsh, raspy tone unsettled the walls. He pulled a green slip of paper from his pocket. A check, already made out to the company for the full amount.

Fritz reached out for the check. His fingers hovered over the green paper. ""Shouldn't you tell your son about this?""

Bill made a motion to the hallway on the right. ""His door is the one at the end. Only one that's closed.""

Fritz let go of a weighty breath. ""You should—""

The father looked up to Fritz. Fire and misery wavered in his green pupils. ""I don't have the words. You tell him.""

Fritz had seen that look before, parents who couldn't bear it anymore. They went into dreams and never really came out, even after the serum wore off. The company never followed up to ask how it ended.

The salesman placed the check in his pocket. He lifted the ceramic bottle from the briefcase and uncorked it. Yellow light erupted from the opening and filled the room.

""What do I have to do?"" Bill's eyes barely followed the bottle's illumination.

""Absolutely nothing."" The salesman's voice was almost muted. ""I put it on your temple, and you can dream immediately.""

Fritz opened his mouth to speak but closed it again. He jammed his forefinger against the mouth of the bottle and tilted it. A drop of yellow, viscous liquid gleamed on his forefinger. He touched Bill's temple. The father's face contorted. A second later, his watery eyes became glassy and placid.

Fritz corked the bottle. The father entered the dream state almost immediately.

The salesman walked to the closed door at the end of the hallway and knocked.

""Dad?"" A feeble voice came through the scarred wood.

""No, I'm Fritz. You're Damon, right? I'm from Sunny Dreams. May I come in?""

A long pause. ""Yeah, I'm Damon. You my dad's friend?""

Fritz hesitated. ""Yes, I'm a friend of your father's.""

Long silence. Fritz felt his knuckles strain.

""Okay, come in. Can you get my dad?""

Fritz looked down the hall. The father stared into nothing. He almost called out but pictured hysteria and thought better. He turned the doorknob.

The room was as dusty as the rest of the house. The blanket, picturing a cowboy riding a rocket, was faded but clean. Sitting upright against the headboard was a pale, thin boy. Damon. His cheeks were sunken. ""Is dad with you?"" He shuddered.

Fritz dug his grey loafer into the dust. ""No, your dad asked me to talk to you for a moment. If it's a bad time, we can wait.""

The boy's mouth curved downward. He reached up a shaky hand to twirl messy, straw-colored hair. ""Oh. Can you check on him? Haven't seen him for a bit.""

Fritz took a cautious step forward. ""Just talked to him. He's okay.""

""Thank goodness."" The boy smiled a little. ""He's been quiet, quieter than usual, all week.""

Fritz's body tensed. ""Really?""

The boy dipped his head. ""Yeah. Hadn't seen Phillip or Greg in a while, either. Dad said they'd come over. Haven't though.""

""Well then I guess they'll miss the party."" Fritz sat in a wooden chair by the bed.

The boy hiccupped into a giggle. ""You're weird.""

""I've been told.""

""What's that?"" Damon nodded at the ceramic bottle.

""It's a serum, or a magic potion, depending on who you ask.""

The boy snorted, but it came out as a weak whinny. ""Yeah, right. You my nurse today? I thought dad said they stopped sending them.""

Fritz eyed the boy's hand kneading the blanket. ""No, I'm not a nurse. I'm a salesman. I sell Liquid Sunshine.""

The boy tilted his head. In response, Fritz uncorked the bottle, and golden light flooded the room. The sickly child reached out. The salesman let him run his hand above the bottle's mouth without touching it. Yellow light curled around the child's fingers but didn't touch the ceiling.

""That's wild. What's that stuff do? Is it medicine?""

Fritz put on his best smile. ""Not quite. What I do is put a drop on the side of your head, and it lets you dream.""

Damon cocked an eyebrow. ""I do that all the time when I sleep.""

Fritz closed the bottle and held up a finger. ""Ah, but this serum will let you control when you dream and what you dream about. You can be whoever you want. Have whatever you want. If you could have that, what would it be?""

Damon drummed his thumb against the blanket. ""I'd probably want to be Roy Goodson.""

""Roy Goodson? Pitcher for the Mets, right? Good choice. He's a great player.""

""Not this year. I hear dad watching the games. Says Roy's a talentless bastard. I'd want to be Roy with talent so dad won't get so mad.""

Despite himself, Fritz chuckled. ""Shouldn't use that language. It'll make hair grow on your tongue.""

""What mom used to say to dad. His tongue ain't Sasquatch yet.""

Fritz chuckled again before he remembered the picture on the mantlepiece and grimaced. ""So a good Goodson then?""

Damon smiled weakly at the wordplay. ""Maybe. But I can do anything right? Could I go hang gliding, or ride a horse?""

""You most certainly could. You could ride a giraffe or elephant if you wanted.""

""You ever ride a horse?""

Memories flooded Fritz's mind. He took in a breath. ""Once, at an event with an old girlfriend.""

""That had to be amazing.""

""It was for her. I screamed the whole time. Stupid beast went too fast.""

The boy giggled, a gravelly rasp. ""Always wanted to. Dad said he'd take me on my next birthday.""

""That'll give you something to look forward to.""

The boy blew a raspberry. ""I haven't been out since forever. Mom and Dad said it'd be a while. I miss going outside. Haven't thrown a baseball in weeks.""

Fritz raised the bottle. ""With this you'll be throwing with the best.""

Damon's hand went under his pillow. He drew out a baseball with a faded logo. ""Wanna play catch?""

""Shouldn't throw a ball in the house. You'll break something.""

The boy smirked. ""Chicken?""

Fritz's face erupted in a grin. ""Mama didn't raise a chicken. Toss it.""

The boy and the salesman lightly tossed the ball back and forth. Fritz kept his muscles limp and let the ball roll off his fingers. Damon gripped the ball tight, each throw bringing a grunt.

""Ever play baseball?"" Damon said.

""No, dad couldn't afford the shoes.""

""Got mine from Greg's brother. Been playing since Tee Ball, up till third grade until—"" Damon caught the ball and held it. ""I had to stop.""

""Couldn't play catch after that?"" Fritz bit his tongue.

""Got too hard. Made me real tired.""

""What about Phillip and Greg?"" 

“They said it was too boring. That was about when they stopped coming."" 

Fritz's jaw tightened. ""I see.""

""Dad said it was dumb when I wanted to be an astronaut.""

Fritz was taken aback. ""Why?""

""Said no one in our family was smart enough. But I got As in math class.""

""You can be one right now if you desire.""

Damon shook his head once. ""No, it's okay. They say it's lonely in space.""

""You could have anyone you want with you.""

""I'd rather play here on earth."" Damon took a deep breath. ""I don't want to be an astronaut anyway. Only said that because it got hard to run to first base.""

Damon looked sideways at Fritz. ""You always want to be a salesman?""

Fritz paused for a long moment. He twirled a silver hair on his chin. ""Can't really say.""

""Is it a secret? You can tell me."" The boy hesitated. ""If you want. I think we're friends.""

Fritz rocked his head from side to side. ""When I was your age, I wanted to be a fireman. Those guys holding onto the firetruck looked really heroic. Then I got older. I wanted to be a teacher but—"" Fritz shrugged. ""I never did because I thought kids wouldn't like listening to me.""

Damon's form slumped a little. ""I like listening to you.""

The edges of Fritz's mouth flickered upward. ""Oh, you do?""

""Yeah, you sound like you'd say interesting things. What'd you want to teach?""

""History. Used to love all those stories of great men and women who did great things, even when the world said they shouldn't. Wish I could meet some of those people.""

""Can't that magic potion let you do that?"" Damon coughed, a guttural sound from his throat.

""No. I'd only be talking to the echo of them I imprinted on my mind. I want to talk to the real them.""

""Maybe you can someday. I bet they'd want to listen to you, too.""

Fritz's flickering smile guttered. ""Those great people? No. I'd be listening. They have more wisdom than I ever could.""

""That's why they'd listen. They know what they know, but not what you know. They'd be smart and shut up.""

""Might be right. Maybe my old-fashioned earthly wisdom would calm all the brilliant ideas screaming in their heads.""

Damon's eyes got a little brighter, though his form quaked against his mattress. ""It'd be so great to talk like those people. Get people to listen to your ideas. Make the world a better place.""

Fritz's hands tightened on the bottle. The ceramic was cool against his fingers. ""That's all within your grasp.""

Damon shook his head lightly, just once. The effort made his body quiver. He unleashed a powerful cough. ""No. Have to go to college to be a big thinker like those people. Ms. Barrons is a good teacher, but she don't teach big ideas.""

Fritz ran the tip of his tongue behind his teeth. ""What kind of big ideas?""

""Like mowing old Ms. Matterly's yard for free and not telling anybody about it.""

Fritz smiled despite himself. ""That's a good thing to do.""

""Ms. Barrons says so."" Damon swallowed and pressed himself more firmly against the headboard.

Fritz jammed his fingers into the cork of the bottle. ""I could make you into a teacher that helps big idea people reach their dreams.""

Damon's cheeks rose. His smile felt brighter to Fritz than the light from the serum. ""You should be my teacher. You could teach me how to be nice to big idea people. Maybe you can teach me your old, smart ideas. I can take little pieces of them and make a new one.""

""I can't. I'm a salesman."" Fritz's eyes held water. He opened the bottle with a pop and pressed his thumb over the top. ""This stuff, it'll let you see me as your teacher.""

Damon's body slid downward. His smile didn't fade. ""Only your echo.""

The word echoed in Fritz's mind. How many echoes had he been talking to all these years? How many pieces of himself had he left behind in dusty rooms like this one?

Fritz placed some of the serum on his thumb and put the cork back in. ""Don't you want anything at all? Anything. Name it. It'll give it to you."" His voice caught.

Damon stopped sliding downward. His eyes faced the ceiling. ""Just to talk to you. This was nice.""

Fritz moved his thumb toward the boy's temple. ""Sure kid. I enjoyed myself, too. Maybe I can stop by again.""

Damon moved a heavily quaking hand against Fritz's wrist. The salesman's thumb was inches from the boy's temple. ""Thank you, Mr. Fritz."" The voice was a hoarse whisper.

Fritz moved his thumb away. Hand shaking, he brought it close to his own temple. Very close. The shine on his finger. The promise of dreams unbound. Any dream, at will. All he had to do was lean into the glow. 

Fritz brushed his thumb against the leg of his cream slacks. The yellow shine faded into the fabric. Now it just looked like a small, thick urine stain.

Damon's breathing slowed. Fritz sat quietly with the boy as the afternoon light faded.

A presence left the room before Fritz did.

The salesman stood. He looked at the boy's peaceful face, and felt something he couldn't name. He closed the door behind him and walked past Bill, still smiling at nothing in the living room.

The Sacramento Kings and Los Angeles Lakers are set to clash in what might be the most one-sided preseason finale since the Denver Nuggets played the Guangzhou Loong Lions. Let’s break this down with the statistical rigor of a tax auditor and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s had one too many coffee drinks.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Lakers Are the Preseason’s Uninvited Houseguest

The Lakers are massive -7.5 favorites, with decimal odds hovering around **1.34-1.36** (implied probability: **74-76%**). For the Kings, their **3.2-3.4 odds** suggest bookmakers give them a **23-30%** chance—about the same likelihood of me correctly predicting the outcome of a coin flip while blindfolded. The total is set at **227.5 points**, which feels generous given both teams’ preseason offensive struggles.

Here’s the math: If the Lakers win by 8 points, they “cover” the spread. Given the Kings’ current state, this feels less like a basketball game and more like a math test where the answer is always “Lakers win.”

---

### Digesting the News: The Kings’ Roster Is a Joke (Literally)

The Sacramento Kings enter this game as the NBA’s version of a *broken VCR*: present, but useless. They’re missing **DeMar DeRozan** (injury), **Domantas Sabonis** (injury), and **Malik Monk** (injury), leaving their offense to rely on… *checks notes*… Russell Westbrook’s “hustle” and the hope that a player named “Trenton Hall” isn’t a real person.

Westbrook’s addition? A depth-chart decoration. He’s the NBA’s version of a “This space intentionally left blank” footnote. The Kings’ preseason? A four-game losing streak by an average of 9 points. Their only silver lining: They’ve lost to competitive teams (Raptors, Blazers, Clippers), not the Charlotte Hornets’ second-string squad.

The Lakers, meanwhile, are… *surprisingly* functional without LeBron James. Sciatica has sidelined King James, but the Lakers are using this game as a “dress rehearsal” for their regular-season opener. That means **Luka Dončić**, **Austin Reaves**, and \*\*Deandre Ayton

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Valencia Basket vs. AS Monaco: A EuroLeague Showdown Where the Odds Are Stacked Like a Monaco Casino**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a EuroLeague clash that’s as much about statistics as it is about survival. Valencia Basket, reeling from a 2-0 start to their five-game-in-six-days gauntlet, heads to Monaco like a tourist with a one-way ticket and a suitcase full of doubts. Meanwhile, AS Monaco struts into the Salle Gaston Médecin like a James Bond villain with a 100% home record, a top-tier frontcourt, and a résumé that includes stealing steals (they’re second in steals per game, folks). Let’s break this down with the precision of Mike James dishing a no-look pass.

---

### Parsing the Odds: When Numbers Speak Louder Than Coaches

The betting lines make AS Monaco the clear favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **1.35-1.41** (implying a **70-74% implied probability** of victory). Valencia, on the other hand, sits at **3.0-3.25** odds (**31-33% implied probability**), which is about the same chance as correctly guessing a roulette number blindfolded. The spread? Monaco is favored by **6.5 points**, a margin that feels less like basketball and more like a math test.

Monaco’s dominance in efficiency metrics is staggering. They’re fourth in defensive efficiency, second in steals (3.5 per game), and sixth in offensive output (121.2 points per 100 possessions). Valencia, while leading the league in three-pointers (12.5 per game), is a cautionary tale of inconsistency, with a 2-2 record and a historical 0-2 mark against Monaco in EuroLeague. Their only silver lining? A three-point unit that could theoretically win this game by itself—if only their opponents played *defense* like a coffee shop on a Monday morning.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, History, and the Weight of Expectations

Valencia’s woes are as numerous as the number of bookmakers offering this game. Key absences include center Yankuba Sima (injured), who’s missed more games than a vegan at a barbecue, and Jean Montero, who’s back in training but not yet fully cleared. Their coach, Pedro Martínez, is about to coach his 200th game with the team—impressive, until you realize it’s like a chef with a

I’ve known this person for almost 5 years now. I used to be so in love with her — like thinking about her every single day kind of love. But life isn’t always kind, and a lot of things happened that changed the way I see love completely.

Before all of this, I used to love watching romance movies — the simple, non-toxic kind. I loved seeing people who supported and appreciated each other. Now… I can’t even enjoy that anymore. It doesn’t feel real to me.

It all started a few months after our “perfect” relationship began. She started talking about her ex. At first, it bothered me a little, but I told myself it was fine. Until one day, she followed him on Instagram. I asked her why, and she said it was “just curiosity.” I told her it made me uncomfortable and asked her to unfollow him. She refused — even after I explained several times how it made me feel.

I remember her first birthday with me. I’m not the type of guy who’s naturally romantic, but I put a lot of effort into it — handmade gifts, letters, little things from the heart. She loved it. But the next day, she was talking to her ex again, as if everything I did meant nothing.

Later, she promised me she’d block him after getting closure about why he left her suddenly. She talked to him… but when I asked if she could block him now, she said no. Then, after she saw me upset, she finally agreed to block him. Even after that, she would still bring him up — telling me about their “anniversary,” or how he once had coffee with her dad.

There were other things too. Like reposting attractive guys on TikTok while we were together, or following guys who were basically showing off their bodies online.

All of this happened about three years ago, but I still can’t forget it.

And sometimes she just wasn’t supportive. Once, I made a mistake that only affected me — and I already felt terrible about it. Instead of helping me grow from it, she kept blaming me over and over again.

All of this changed me. Over these 5 years, I’ve slowly lost the ability to feel love. I used to love loving — now I just feel numb.

For context, I’ve taken some personality tests and I’m an ENFJ — the type that usually feels deeply, cares deeply. But I don’t recognize that part of myself anymore.

# Chapter 5: Fun with dates

 

# Dec 05, 2024: Mona

***Incubus***

I smile as a patron that is always a delight to serve is standing in front of me. “It is always a good day when I see the good Queen Mab, how may I serve you today?”

Did I need to drop the word “serve” a little and dunk it in sexual overtones?  No. 

Am I sorry I did?  Also no.

She winks at me. My biggest bane in existence returns to hit me again. Fucking rule 3… yes, the rule doesn’t cover staff and thanks to that the most wonderful humans around have been able to share experiences with me. And they have been so much fun.

*But Mab is unattainable.  Rule 3.  Sad. I would not mind being ended by her if…. Oh fuck.  Can she hear?*

She smiles as I hand her drink to her. Oh good. Safe.

“You would not be subject to that rule if you were no longer employed and on the exception list, you know.”

Fuck. She heard. 

I think about my chances of ever getting on the Mayday list as they call it here now. If you are so unlikely to hurt someone that Ms. Wallace compared you to May as an equal, you are on the list.

I will never be on that list. Not after everything I have done. I feel something weird.  What is this tightness. I feel anxious. Wait? Is this regret?  Since when have I been able to feel that?

I decide to distract myself and instead casually drop my baited hook out.  “But then I wouldn’t be able to pose in the calendar like I did with some of the staff.”  I glance at the advertisement on the community board.

She gets a surprised face and walks to the board.  Looking at the calendar ad on the wall she does a little hop?!?!  It is imperceptible unless you have spent hundreds of years learning body language.  WHAT?  Quickly she walks back up to me.

“There are calendars with the lovely staff in it?  Please tell me, is it all the staff?” She has an air of curiosity.  Against someone not 2.8 millennia old, this would have worked. I caught the excitement.

Wow, Mab, you got it bad.

“Staff from 2024. Including myself and Jacqueline in March and Lemar with May and Ms. Wallace in April,” I answer her real question.  She notices.

“Where may I purchase one?” She is pulling out a card. All black. Okay. She means business.  Time to upsell.

“Which one?”  I smile and her eyes very VERY briefly show surprise.

“There is more than one?”

I got her. Time to reel in this whale. “The standard pin up style calendar and the one made and published by a Sidhe photographer using their enchanted MiNT TLR. All of that calendar is people’s cores and true forms. Including those two wonderful ladies.”

“I take it you used your true form?”

I nod and lean forward to whisper. “Jackie, myself, Patricia and Grey went nude, the dark elf may as well have… We even got Carrot in both calendars.”

“Again, where do I get them and pay?”  She pets Carrot without even thinking about it as he brushes up against her hand. Her hand is almost imperceptibly shaking.

I pull out 2 calendars with similar but distinct covers. She doesn’t even bother checking the price. “Four of each, please.”

Oh course. The card is all black, no markings or numbers I can see. The register accepts it. No name. Damn. She gets them in a bag and smiles at me. “I know I was played, beautiful one. I don’t care at all. Thank you.”

She begins walking away and I wish she was even half as attracted to me as she is to Ms. Wallace.  That would be a fun time for both of us.

Oh well, I have things to do right now. Staring at Mab’s incredible ass in that skirt as she walks out the door should not be one of them.  But damn if it doesn’t happen to be what I do.

She waves at me, looks over her shoulder and winks.

I should probably stop looking for the unattainable.  *She and Ms. Wallace are out of my league.*

*""You are in a league of your own, beautiful one, you value yourself far too little.*""

I didn’t realize they can project back.  Oh boy.  She is in for a surprise.  I never told her about November and December…

 

# Dec 05, 2024: Mab, The Winter Queen

***Sidhe***

The Incubus lied to me in the best way possible.  I flipped through the mundane calendar on the way to my car.  The driver smiles in his normal manner and comments on my having a calendar of a local coffee shop making sense.  I almost asked why, but I do own the place and he knows it.  I also do come here fairly often now. 

I look at the normal one and the scene in March is adorable.  They look to be having so much fun playing darts while still managing pin up poses from classic calendars.  Well done.

I go to April.  Patricia is popping out of a birthday cake with rabbit ears while Lemar and May look on in shock.  I find myself smiling without meaning to. 

I flip through, I see many of my favorite people.  The addition of Connie to the roster was a very sweet gesture.   Wait. Is he?  He is. He is chasing her with a sparkler!  I laugh.

And then I see November.  She is there again, with all of them as they look to chase a turkey.  The various accessories lending an air of silliness to it.  The cat is laying down as if bored of the ordeal.  Brilliant.  Why am I so happy?  Why am I so excited?

With a cautious hand I flip it to December.  I see Mona dressed as a cute child sitting on Patricia’s lap and looking at her lovingly.  Oh my, this is… this one is definitely in love and the camera caught it.  Jacqueline is handing Patricia a box that is oh so naughty without being so.  The rest of the scene is adorable.  I close it and look up directly into the eyes of my driver as he looks in the rear-view mirror.

“If you are smiling that much, ma’am, I think I need to buy one myself.”  He looks back at the road and continues to get us to our destination.  I am in a good mood.  I think I will share it.  As we arrive at my main office complex, he opens my door.  I hand him an unopened standard calendar. 

“No need to buy one.  I bought extra.  Here you go.  Enjoy the insanity that is the minds of the staff at my favorite place.”  I give him my best smile and walk to the elevator.  I turn and see him smiling and waving.  I need to give him a Christmas Bonus.  I nod and begin opening my financial app.  I go about putting the bonus on his next pay check while I ride up.

Millie, my Administrative Assistant stands up and hands me 2 folders.  “Ma’am, here’s the dossier you wanted on the new acquisition as well as your morning reports.  You have nothing booked until 10am.”  

“Thank you, Millie.  I will read this and would like not to be disturbed unless it is an emergency until at least 9:30.”  I smile at her and she looks a little surprised.

""*Wow, she’s actually happy.  She’s so good at faking it that it’s hard to tell, but this is only the fourth time I have seen a genuine smile.  They have come along a lot more frequently.  Good for her.""*

I believe she is right.  Well, this dossier is simple enough, I have it done in 5 minutes and I am pleased.  Everything is going according to plan, or close enough.  If Millie was here she’d see another smile.  The morning reports show we have divested of some specific companies. I made a sizable profit while helping someone I do like. I then invested that in Matthew’s company. The best part is they won’t know I helped him. I am also waiting. Soon there will be chaos, I can feel it.  I will make money from it.

Now, more importantly.  Let’s look at the Calendar of Enchantments.  “Heavily photoshopped disclaimer.”  Good, she knows how to make it seem plausible. 

While I love all of them, if I am correct, they mirrored the first calendar.  With shaky hands I immediately go to April. 

She is majestic.  I…  I really am in love.  Fuck. There is no denying it when my col… my heart flutters like this. *Damn you, Jacqueline.  Thank you, Jacqueline.*

Okay, November.  Hahahahaha. She is scooping the mortals up to give chase.  The scene is ridiculous and in being so, wonderful.

Alright, now for…

I HATE MONA.  Unequivocally.

I wish that was me…

The toy is much more obviously one.  Wait, is Jacqueline’s hair on fire?  What?  I flip to March.  WHAT?!?!?!?!  She… That’s not a Fae gift.  We can’t do that.  Not even if we just use our gifts to see or hear, we don’t manifest things partially with that much control. 

What is Jacqueline?

Also, I have to admit, her and Mona.  I am a little jealous of Patricia now as well as in love with her.  DAMMIT.

I think I will contact Skerrit.  Who is in the Penthouse at his building? What do I need to do to get it…

 

# Dec 06, 2024: Hanna “Doc” Peters

***Enlightened Annoyed Human***

“Would you send in the next clients, Jill?” She nods and goes out. She’s wearing something a bit too tight for my liking and her sway is very much on purpose.  Hmmm.

*“I so want to climb that mountain of a man…”*

Oberon and Titania walk in.  He’s smiling. She is all but laughing as she walks in. They sit and I wonder what I can do to help these two. They’ve been together for eons if I am correct. If they don’t have good coping mechanisms as a couple by now, that ship sailed long ago.

“Good day you two. Let’s go over your needs, issues, and goals.  Why are you here, good people?” I give them a smile and watch as they give me absolutely no information through their body language. They are statues.

They turn at one another and then to me.  Titania speaks and drops a bomb on me. “We have fallen out of love. We are both in love with many partners, but sadly, not the other. We’d like to learn to fall in love again.”

*Well fuck, I… I… how do you do this? I suppose if I can help them love themselves and find the thing they had initially started falling in love with, that might work?*

Oberon nods. Huh? He looks at me. “That could work, yes. Doctor, you should moderate your emotions when thinking about a Fae client. Even our weakest could have heard that.”

I scowl a little. “Hard to do when you hit me with a hell of a monster task. My apologies, I am usually better at this. Things have been a little crazy of late.”

Titania “My apologies for that. Your business has been very busy since the wedding?”

“You have no idea.”  I also don’t know why I have the ability to hear thoughts, but I keep that to myself. Titania’s smile is beautiful and kind. “Well, let’s start talking about the beginning and work from there. I can only help you if you want it and you are both on board.”

Time to get to work.

 

# Dec 07, 2024: Mona, Archdemon

***Incubus***

The chime rings. I hear Devil Went Down to Georgia and my heart sinks. Uh-oh. I have been dreading this moment for a bit. I know who this is. I heard about the chime.

He hasn’t changed a bit in 1100 years. I am not sure why I am surprised.  He didn’t the 1700 before.

He walks up. I punch in his order and get a smile. I get his 13 ice cubes and hand him his cup. He counts the ice cubes. Apparently, he always does and always smiles happily.  Like now. I try to smile, but it is hard to do when he is looking at me.

“Miss Desdemona, would you happen to be having a break soon?” He says this like he doesn’t know. Please. I have seen devils here three shifts in a row. They looked at their phones when I took a break. They were checking the time. The one today waved as I walked in and then left. This was a set up. Sammy was waiting for this moment.

“We both know the answer to that.”  I look at Lemar.  He looks at Sammy. He starts walking up to Samael, The Fallen. The Devil. 

Lemar has a thing. He remains calm unless the situation is so dire anyone would be terrified. And even then, he’s just a little afraid. He shows no fear today facing Samael himself. “Sammy, if you do anything to hurt her, I will find a way to make you unhappy.  If I have to save every soul on the planet, I will.”

Sammy smiles at him, “I can see she has a great family here. I absolutely believe you would find a way to do just that. Don’t worry.  I wouldn’t dream of hurting this young lady.”

Lemar nods. He nods at me. “Take a break, Mona.”

I… I… wow. Damn Lemar. Something weird is going on in my chest. Okay. I can handle this.

I grab a drink and sit down across from him and sip my drink.  He looks and smiles. “You know, I was impressed when you realized that contract for the entire lunar period of bliss with that mortal didn’t include a ‘go back to hell at the end of the period’ rider. You always were one to know how to use the rules to your advantage.”

I stare at him. He has a point. I know he will get to it.

He takes a drink and smiles at me. I feel no malice or anger. That’s good news. “You feel like you are happy here?”

I nod. “Yes I am, Lightbringer, Greatest of the Fallen.”

“Titles today?  Okay. Smart. Did you know I never liked demons? The devils all went to hell because my father has a plan and we didn’t like the methods used to achieve it. We had a consequence for our disagreement.  You fell because you were a victim of dad’s plan. You had a horrible life.  And your reaction was tremendously hurtful.”

I nod.  “I did seduce and ruin a lot of people to get my revenge on those men.”

He shakes his head. “I don’t give a fuck about those sinners. They are in hell being denied a chance to touch a doppelganger of you as their punishment. I am talking about you. You shredded your own soul in the pursuit of that revenge. The mark on your belly is the manifestation of the remains of your soul.  You hurt yourself. I hated that. You would have gone to heaven…”

I glare at him. “Don’t fucking lie to me.  After all I did, hell waited.”

“I am not lying, Desdemona. You were a victim. You were used and hurt and just did what you had to survive. You weren’t going to my care. And then you screamed in agony to be able to have your revenge. You called to me. In doing so you damned yourself. And I hate that. I wish I could have denied your dying wish.”

I look at him. Why does he look so sad?  Why is he sad for me? “Why couldn’t you?”

He looks down. “Dad put a rule in place. One that has consequences if we don’t follow it.  We must honor your free will.  I agreed to that rule to survive.  Even if I don’t want to follow it, I have to. I know he has a plan. I don’t know what it is. I do know that you are here and that is fine.”

“Sammy, what the hell?  So, you aren’t here to send me back until I get summoned like so many other demons?”  I can’t believe this.

He shakes his head. “The thing about that rule about returning is that it exists for demons that are dangerous.”

I look at him, “And I am not?”

He fucking laughs at me. “You always held your end of deals and always do your best not to screw over people. Especially the ones not in contracts. You even taught other lust demons to behave like you do and that has saved many souls. Also, how many demons are actively working at a coffee shop because they like the people?”

I shrug. “Ms. Wallace was thinking of another hiring round…”

He laughs. “Well, you sex demons are the least dangerous of the lot thanks to you. You even got many of the others to change their feeding habits after you could stay.”

I nod. “I was worried if we made too many waves, you would come collect us. Terrified of it. Like when I saw you walk in.” 

“I have no intention of picking you up. And I know a devil or two that could use an application.”

I wink. “So, we’re good, Samael, Master of Sinners?”

“Hahaha. You seriously get formal when you are worried or showing respect. Always have. I know you always use her last name for that reason.”

I shrug.  “You are the only power in existence that can destroy my life here. I am going to be polite to you.  And she is one of the few people that can top me.”

“That she is.  While it is true I could destroy your life here, I wouldn’t dream of it. You are happy here. I have always believed that humans should always have the freedom to choose their destiny. You have chosen yours. I wouldn’t get in the way. Also, Patricia would hurt me. A lot.” He genuinely looks scared at the thought of it.

“I… I. Wow. I didn’t realize just how terrified I was of this meeting. Seeing you was worse than I imagined and so much better. Thank you, sir.”

He gets up. “It’s about time to get off your break and I am going to go deal with Stalin bitching again.”

We get up and he extends his hand. Screw that. I hug him. He seems surprised.  I mean, I just got a new lease on my existence, least I can do.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

My 11yr old ASD son made me an iced coffee this morning (he does this often and I never ask! He so thoughtful and I love him for it!) but today was different. 

I took a big sip and immediately felt pain in my tongue and what felt like metal in my mouth! I spit it out and I see a sewing needle!! I turn around and he is laughing and pointing at me and said “HAHA I PRANKED YOU!!” 

I tell him right away that this isn’t a prank! It’s cruel and I could have died if I swallowed it (little dramatic but he needs to know the severity). I said “pranks don’t hurt people” but He just kept laughing and saying “pranks aren’t real” at this point I’m SEETHING but I’m trying to keep my cool! I attempt to try to tell him the difference but he’s just staring at me blankly and said “I saw it on YouTube and the mom didn’t die”

He doesn’t even have YouTube. It’s blocked in my house and on all devices! I asked him where he saw it but he won’t tell me.

I just dropped him off at school and now I’m in my car crying cause I don’t want him to do this to someone else!! I also have a 5yr old ASD daughter.

1o90wxr,https://i.redd.it/6lbfgu7c8ovf1.jpeg,From Gym Injury to Recovery – How a Hand Surgeon in Pune Saved My Grip Strength,"# When Passion Meets Pain

It started like any other gym day — heavy weights, loud music, and that extra push for one more rep. But that one rep changed everything.  
A sudden snap in my wrist, followed by unbearable pain. I couldn’t even hold a coffee mug properly after that. My grip was gone.

Like many fitness enthusiasts, I tried self-healing — ice packs, rest, even Google advice. Nothing worked. My workouts stopped. My daily routine became difficult. That’s when I realized I needed professional help — someone who truly understands the complexity of hand injuries.

 Searching for the Right Specialist

Hand injuries aren’t like regular sprains. They affect strength, coordination, and sometimes even confidence.  
So, I began my search for the best orthopedic doctor in Pune — someone who specialized in treating hand and wrist problems.

Scrolling through reviews, I noticed a common name appearing repeatedly, especially around Kothrud — a doctor who’s known for helping athletes, professionals, and everyday people recover from severe hand injuries.

 The Turning Point – Meeting Dr. Chaitanya Karande

That’s when I found [Dr. Chaitanya Karande](https://g.co/kgs/EDeKUjS), a highly trusted **orthopedic doctor in Kothrud**, Pune.  
From the first visit, I could tell this wasn’t going to be a typical hospital experience.

# 🩺 What Stood Out About Dr. Karande’s Approach

* **Personalized Diagnosis:** Instead of jumping to conclusions, he first understood my fitness habits, weightlifting techniques, and the exact moment of injury.
* **Clear Explanation:** He explained what had gone wrong — a partial ligament tear near the wrist — in simple terms, without medical jargon.
* **Structured Recovery Plan:** My treatment wasn’t just about medication; it involved **hand therapy, gradual strengthening, and mobility sessions**.

 The Science Behind the Recovery

Dr. Karande emphasized that hand recovery is both **a physical and psychological journey**.

# 1. Rest and Immobilization

At first, the wrist was immobilized to reduce strain. This phase tested my patience — I couldn’t type fast, lift anything, or even open a bottle.

# 2. Gradual Physiotherapy

Under his supervision, I began light physiotherapy — finger stretches, grip balls, and resistance bands. Every movement was guided and monitored.

# 3. Strength and Function Restoration

Once pain reduced, we shifted focus to **regaining grip strength** — using specific hand exercises designed for athletes and gym-goers.

Why Choosing the Right Doctor Matters

When you’re dealing with a gym injury, especially one that affects your hands or wrists, time and technique matter the most.  
Many people ignore these injuries or rely on basic painkillers, only to worsen the damage.

Here’s what I learned:

* **Early intervention** can prevent long-term weakness.
* **Specialized orthopedic care** ensures proper diagnosis.
* **Follow-up therapy** is just as important as the initial treatment.

Choosing the [best orthopedic doctor in Pune](https://g.co/kgs/EDeKUjS) made all the difference. It wasn’t just about healing; it was about getting my confidence back.

 Lessons from My Journey

# 1. Listen to Your Body

Pain isn’t weakness — it’s a signal. Don’t ignore it.  
Even a small wrist strain can lead to major complications if untreated.

# 2. Don’t Self-Diagnose

Google might tell you it’s a sprain, but only a doctor can tell if it’s a tendon tear or ligament injury.

# 3. Rehabilitation Is Key

The biggest mistake people make is stopping therapy once the pain fades. Real healing comes from **consistent rehab**.

# 4. Stay Positive During Recovery

Losing strength can hit your confidence, especially for athletes. But recovery is possible — with the right mindset and guidance.

 The Psychology of Recovery

Injuries don’t just affect your body — they challenge your patience, consistency, and motivation.  
There were days when I felt hopeless, thinking I’d never lift again. But small progress each week — an extra 5% grip strength, a pain-free lift — kept me going.

Having an expert like Dr. Karande made that mental recovery smoother. He not only treated the injury but also helped me rebuild my trust in my body.

 Getting Back to the Gym

After weeks of careful therapy and strengthening, I finally returned to the gym.  
This time, I trained smarter — focusing on form, recovery, and prevention.

Here’s what I changed post-recovery:

*  Warm-up and stretching became non-negotiable.
*  Focused on balanced muscle training (not just upper body).
*  Scheduled regular check-ups to avoid re-injury.

The first time I held a dumbbell again, it wasn’t about lifting weight — it was about lifting back my confidence.

 Why Dr. Chaitanya Karande Stands Out

In a city like Pune, where fitness culture is booming, injuries are becoming common. But what makes Dr. Chaitanya Karande stand out is his balance of expertise and empathy.  
He doesn’t just treat bones — he helps people reclaim their lifestyle.

Whether you’re a gym-goer, athlete, or someone dealing with wrist pain from typing or daily strain, consulting an orthopedic doctor in Kothrud can be the turning point in your recovery.

 Final Thoughts: Strength Is More Than Muscle

My journey taught me that strength isn’t just about lifting heavier — it’s about resilience, awareness, and recovery.  
If you’re in Pune and struggling with a hand or wrist injury, don’t delay seeking medical help.  
Sometimes, a single consultation can save months of pain and help you bounce back stronger.",1,1760706651.0,GoodDoctorsinPune,0,1.0,False

But here’s what they don’t see-  
  
1️⃣ Festivals missed. While everyone is lighting diyas and celebrating, you’re revising VARC and solving DILR sets.  
  
2️⃣ Social life on pause. Friends plan trips, but you plan mock schedules.  
  
3️⃣ Weddings skipped. Relatives joke - “You’re always studying!” They don’t see the guilt behind missing moments that matter.  
  
4️⃣ Late nights with coffee and anxiety. Sleep becomes optional when exam day is around the corner.  
  
5️⃣ Mental battles and Constant self-doubt. “Will I make it?” “What if I fail?” - questions that quietly echo every night.  
  
6️⃣ Loneliness. Sitting with books all day in a crowded library, yet feeling like no one else truly gets it.  
  
But here’s the truth-  
  
Every sacrifice is compounding silently.  
Every mock, every doubt you solve, every night you stay up - it’s building more than your score. It’s building you.  
  
And when you finally make it - whether it’s IIMs, XLRI, TISS, or any other dream B-school - you don’t just earn an admit.  
You earn the confidence that you can survive anything life throws at you.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I take Xywav - for about the past six months. Last night I got up in between doses to go to the bathroom like I always do. In retrospect I was still very groggy and out of it. Usually, I am pretty cogent when I wake up in between doses.

I just remember I was at the sink to wash my hands, and I was just standing there; zoned out. The next thing I knew, I fell backwards and landed at a really awkward angle into my bathtub rim. 

I knew immediately it was bad. I lay there, unable to move, just moaning “ohhhhh…… ohhhhhhh…….ohhhhhh…… ohhhhhhhh…..” for a solid minute, before I willed myself to get up. Getting up was excruciating. I’ve broken a rib before, and I know what it feels like. You can’t move. Your core is just…… you physically can’t move because the bones in your core are broken, and it’s excruciating trying to. 

I can’t describe it very well. If you’ve broken a rib before you know what it’s like. Otherwise I don’t know what to say. Other than every move. I make feels like the sharpest most incredible pain in my rib cage.

I live alone. I wanted to call my mom so bad last night, because it hurts so bad and frankly, it was really scary. The way I hit the bathtub rim and crumbled to the floor was really bad. Not to mention excruciatingly painful. I don’t want to bother my mom while she’s getting rest, though I don’t know what she can do? I mean, they can’t do anything for a broken rib to begin with. I went to the hospital last spring and got smacked with a $1500 bill, and I have great insurance. I don’t want to go there just for them to tell me “yes, it’s broken. We can’t do anything about that. Just try to not move too much for the next six weeks. Here’s some ibuprofen” and get bitched with another $1500 hospital bill.

But I’m sitting here, it’s 6 AM, I typically work from home on Fridays so I’d probably be taking my medication, drinking my coffee, scrolling Reddit for a little while, then showering and going to my desk. But I don’t know what to do right now. It hurts to move. It hurts to breathe. I’m just involuntarily moaning over and over again. 

I hate living alone at times like this.

What do I do?  I guess I injured my left elbow in the fall somehow as well - it is tender, and very painful in one area specifically.

I don’t know what to do. I really want to call my mom, but I don’t wanna wake her up for something she can’t do anything about.  She usually wakes up around 7:30am. 

And let me be clear I’m 43 years old. My mom is in her late 70s. I’m not some kid anymore. But I don’t have anyone else to call and I don’t know what to do. I’m in excruciating pain and it hurts desperately to move or even breathe. The hospital won’t be able to do anything, but I feel like there’s no way I can work today. 

I’m pretty new at my new job and I am in the “head down, work hard, don’t make waves, fit in and make a good impression” stage of the job. I’d rather not say “oh yeah, I take GHB at night and I had a nasty fall because I was still high when I got up to pee.” 

I think I’m just looking for connection and moral support right now. I’m all alone and I’m kind of scared from how bad the fall was. And I’m in excruciating pain. And I know this is bad - I know what a broken rib feels like. 

What do I do? Can anyone help me please? Even just a response so I feel less alone?

Recently, a few of my students asked if they could use AI tools for practicing conversational English outside the classroom. I usually recommend language exchanges or podcasts, but I know a lot of learners feel shy talking to real people because they’re afraid of making mistakes.

I came across the [AI Role Play feature in Promova](https://promova.com/press/promova-ai-role-play) \- it’s basically a conversation simulator where you can practice real-life scenarios (ordering coffee, job interviews, chatting with a neighbor). The student speaks out loud, the AI responds naturally, and gives feedback on pronunciation and fluency.

What I liked is that it offers 50+ scenarios, from everyday life to work situations, and it really helps lower that “I’m afraid to sound silly” barrier that keeps many from speaking at all. It works with English, Spanish, French, and German now.

It got me thinking of another strategic but quite risky play using the Category Steal. In Season 2, Keelan won the season in a large part because his category was Periodic Table and no one dared challenge him in the category until there were literally two people left and the remaining contestant had no other choice. If you're in a position to get the Category Steal you already have a decent amount of territory and could potentially be the Whale like Aaron is now. One great defense against being challenged is a difficult category no one wants to play. So one way to use the Category Steal is to find this season's ""Periodic Table"" and take it. In addition, you take it away from the expert in that category. Imagine if you had taken Periodic Table from Keelan. He then is more likely to get challenged and to be eliminated before having a crack at it. The danger of course is you have to have at least some knowledge of said difficult category you're stealing just in case someone is daring enough to challenge you and you shouldn't choose a category if the Expert is near you because you're practically asking them to challenge you in their category if they get a chance.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1o90s7i,https://i.redd.it/1yh32kuh7ovf1.jpeg,Feeling Tired and Sore? It Might Be Time to See a Cardiologist Near Me,"# When Tiredness Isn’t Just Fatigue

We’ve all had those days when we feel unusually tired — a heavy body, slow mornings, and random muscle aches. You might think it’s just work stress or lack of sleep, right? But what if your body is trying to tell you something bigger?

Fatigue, chest discomfort, or shortness of breath can sometimes point toward **heart-related issues**. The scary part? Many people ignore these early warnings.

So, if you’ve been searching for a **cardiologist near me** lately, it might be the smartest move you make for your health.

 Understanding the Modern Heart Struggle

Our generation lives fast — quick meals, endless scrolling, caffeine boosts, and work stress. While we think we’re fine, our heart quietly bears the brunt.

Here’s what’s really happening:

# 1. Sedentary Lifestyle

Sitting for long hours at work or binge-watching shows reduces blood circulation and increases heart risk.

# 2. Stress and Anxiety

High stress raises blood pressure, a silent trigger for heart disease.

# 3. Unhealthy Diets

Processed food, sugar drinks, and skipped meals create chaos in cholesterol and blood pressure levels.

# 4. Ignoring Symptoms

We often mask fatigue with coffee instead of getting a health check-up.

It’s time to stop normalizing constant tiredness.

 When to See a Cardiologist?

It’s easy to confuse normal exhaustion with a deeper issue. But these warning signs shouldn’t be ignored:

* You feel tired even after rest.
* You get short of breath while climbing stairs.
* You often feel dizzy or lightheaded.
* You experience random chest tightness.
* Your heartbeat feels irregular.

If you said yes to any of these, you should book an appointment with a **cardiologist in Baner**.

 Meet Dr. Pravin Pawal — Baner’s Trusted Heart Expert

When it comes to compassionate, expert cardiac care in Pune, [Dr. Pravin Pawal ](https://drpraveenpawalcardiologist.com/)stands out.

Dr. Pawal’s clinic is equipped with modern diagnostic tools and a warm, supportive team that ensures your journey from consultation to recovery is smooth and stress-free.

 What Happens During a Cardiologist Visit?

Visiting a heart specialist doesn’t have to be scary. In fact, it’s one of the smartest self-care moves you can make.

Here’s what to expect:

# 1. Friendly Discussion

You’ll talk about your symptoms, lifestyle, and family health history.

# 2. Basic Tests

ECG, blood pressure monitoring, and cholesterol tests are done to check your heart function.

# 3. Advanced Screening

If needed, the doctor may suggest echocardiography or stress tests to evaluate your heart more deeply.

# 4. Personalized Advice

Instead of generic medicine, you’ll receive a lifestyle plan tailored to your unique needs.

It’s quick, simple, and life-saving when done on time.

 Why Young Adults Should Care About Heart Health

Heart problems are no longer old people issues. Studies show that stress, lack of exercise, and poor diet are making **heart disease a growing concern among young professionals**.

#  Here’s why it matters:

* Early diagnosis prevents major heart events later.
* Mild symptoms today could become serious tomorrow.
* Lifestyle changes at 25 save hospital visits at 45.

So next time your body feels off, don’t ignore it.

 Small Lifestyle Tweaks for a Stronger Heart

You don’t have to overhaul your entire life — just begin with small, consistent changes.

#  Daily Habits That Make a Difference

* Take 20–30 mins walk daily
* Add more fruits, greens, and whole grains
* Reduce caffeine and sugary drinks
* Get 7–8 hours of quality sleep
* Manage stress through yoga or journaling

#  Habits to Break

* Smoking and excessive drinking
* Overeating or skipping meals
* Ignoring regular check-ups

Your heart is your life’s rhythm — protect it before it’s too late.

 Why Choose a Cardiologist in Baner?

Baner is home to some of Pune’s most trusted and advanced healthcare facilities. If you’re living or working nearby, finding a[ cardiologist in Baner ](https://share.google/d16CN3JZrNtsiqktU)means you’ll get top-quality care without long travel or waiting times.

Plus, with doctors like **Dr. Pravin Pawal**, you get both — expertise and empathy.

 Final Thoughts

Tiredness isn’t always “just stress.” It could be your heart asking for help. Whether you’re in your 20s or 50s, routine heart check-ups can be life-changing.

So the next time you search **cardiologist near me**, remember — your health deserves priority. Don’t wait for your body to scream for attention when it’s been whispering all along.

1o90rgg,https://v.redd.it/0baljn0p7ovf1,[MHW-3BOMBER YU Series Force Impact Tamper] is not self-resetting,"Hey everyone,
I’ve got the MHW-3BOMBER YU Series Force Impact espresso tamper, and it’s suddenly stopped self-resetting. Normally, when I push it down, it springs back up automatically — but now it just stays down unless I pull it back manually.

I’ve already:
	•	Checked for coffee grounds jammed in the mechanism
	•	Cleaned and dried everything
	•	Tried pressing from different angles
	•	Made sure the base is properly attached

Still, no luck. The spring doesn’t seem broken, but something’s clearly off — it just won’t rebound on its own.

Has anyone run into this issue? Do I need to lubricate something inside or replace a spring? Or is it likely a warranty issue?

Any teardown tips, diagrams, or firsthand fixes would be super helpful!

Thanks in advance 🙏

1o90qj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpanishAIlines/comments/1o90qj3/lots_of_different_ways_to_say_i_like_in_spanish/,Lots of Different Ways to Say “I like” in Spanish,"Of course, the most common and standard way to say “I like” in Spanish is me gusta, but Spanish also has many other alternatives, both universal and regional, that can help you understand native speakers better and make your speech more diverse.

However, most of the expressions I’ve included in this post follow the same structure as “gustar”, so let’s first take a quick look at how to use this verb correctly before moving on to the alternatives.

How to Use GUSTAR in Spanish

The verb gustar doesn’t work like “to like” in English.

In Spanish, the structure is reversed, instead of “I like something,” you’re literally saying “Something pleases me.” That’s why we use indirect object pronouns (me, te, le, etc.) to show who is pleased.

Structure

* me / te / le / nos / os / les + gusta (+ singular noun or infinitive verb)
* ¿Te gusta leer? → Do you like reading?

Plural form

* me / te / le / nos / os / les + gustan (+ plural noun)
* Les gustan los museos. → They like museums.

Adding emphasis or contrast

* To emphasize who likes something, or to clarify the subject, add “a + pronoun” at the beginning:
* A mí me gusta el chocolate. → I (personally) like chocolate.

With “que + subjunctive”

* When gustar is followed by a clause starting with ""que"", the verb that follows must be in the subjunctive mood:
* Me gusta que vengas temprano. → I like that you come early.

And now, let’s move on to the alternatives.

Stronger ways to say “I like”

* me encanta → I love / I’m crazy about
* me fascina → I’m fascinated by / I really love
* me apasiona → I’m passionate about
* me gusta mucho → I like it a lot

Neutral / Formal alternatives

* me agrada → I find it pleasant / I like it
* me resulta agradable → It feels pleasant to me
* me parece interesante → It seems interesting to me
* soy aficionado a → I’m fond of / I’m into
* soy fan de → I’m a fan of

Talking about people (non-romantic)

* me cae bien → I like him/her (as a person)

Expressing preferences

* prefiero → I prefer
* soy más de + noun/infinitive → I’m more of a (something) person / I tend to 

Soy más de café que de té. → I’m more of a coffee person than a tea person. (= I prefer coffee.)

* tiro más por (colloquial) → I lean more toward / I’m more into

Regional Alternatives and Slang:

* Me mola (ES) → I dig it / it’s cool
* Me flipa (ES) → I’m crazy about it / it blows my mind
* Me late (MX/CA) → I’m into it / I like it
* Me gusta un buen (MX) → I like it a lot.
* Me cuadra (CO/PE/VE/EC) → It suits me / I like it
* Me vacila (PE/Carib.) → I’m into it / it entertains me 
* Me copa (AR/UY) → I’m into it / I love it

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1o90oqq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o90oqq,My Fairytale Was A Cruel Lie (free link please),"I was the scholarship kid at Westbrook University, dating the star quarterback, Gage Barton. Everyone on campus thought I was living a fairytale, the brilliant girl from the wrong side of the tracks who had captured the prince's heart. My roommate, Cayden, was my best friend, the one I trusted with all my secrets.

But my fairytale was a lie. My prince was a cruel narcissist who saw me as his pet project, and my best friend was a snake who secretly sl**t with him, seething with jealousy over everything I had earned.

Their betrayal culminated in an act of pure evil. Using my own laptop, Cayden permanently deleted my entire thesis-one hundred and twelve pages of research that represented my only ticket out of their world. My future was gone in a single click.

When I confronted them, they laughed. ""It's just a st**id paper,"" Gage sneered, accusing me of deleting it myself to save face. They stood together, a united front of privilege and cruelty, believing they had finally broken me.

But they were wrong. I calmly walked over to Cayden's desk, where her own laptop was open, her final project displayed on the screen. Next to it sat a full glass of water. I picked it up and poured it directly onto the keyboard.

The screen sparked, then went black.

As she shrieked in horror, I repeated his words back to her, my voice cold as ice. ""It's just a st**id project. Why are you making such a big drama out of it?""


Chapter 1
Aracely Adkins knew her place at Westbrook University. It was a place paid for by a scholarship, earned through years of sleepless nights and relentless study. It was a place she clung to with the desperation of someone who had seen the alternative. Her relationship with Gage Barton, the star quarterback, was supposed to be a different kind of place-a fairytale. At least, that's what everyone on campus seemed to think.

Gage came from new money, the kind that shouted its existence with flashy cars and buildings named after his father. The Bartons were major donors, and Gage moved through the university's hallowed halls as if he owned them. He saw Aracely as his most charitable project. A brilliant, beautiful girl from the wrong side of the tracks, polished by his association. He liked the way it made him look generous.

Aracely told herself she loved him. She ignored the way he dismissed her academic achievements in front of his friends, the way he casually criticized her second-hand clothes, the way his eyes would glaze over when she talked about her thesis-the very thesis that was her ticket to a life beyond Gage's shadow.

Her roommate, Cayden Padilla, was her supposed best friend. Cayden was always there to comfort her after Gage' s latest slight, always ready with a hug and a whispered, ""He doesn't mean it. He just doesn't know how to show he cares."" Cayden knew all of Aracely's insecurities, all of her dreams. She collected them like precious stones, all while secretly seething with a jealousy that poisoned everything. Cayden wanted Aracely' s intellect, her opportunities, and most of all, she wanted Gage.

And she had him.

Aracely wasn't a fool. She saw the lingering touches, the shared glances that lasted a second too long. But she chose to believe the lies they both fed her. To lose Gage was to lose the fragile social standing she had. To lose Cayden was to be completely alone. So she swallowed the bitter taste of suspicion and smiled.

The Annual Donor Gala was the pinnacle of the university's social calendar, and Aracely felt like an imposter in a borrowed dress.

""There she is,"" Gage's voice boomed across the marble floor. He was standing with a circle of his teammates, all of them built like modern gladiators in ill-fitting tuxedos.

He strode over and draped a heavy arm around her shoulders, pulling her into his side. ""Everyone, this is Aracely. Isn't she something? I clean her up nice, don't I?""

A few of his friends chuckled. Aracely' s smile felt brittle.

""You look beautiful tonight,"" he murmured, his breath smelling of expensive whiskey. His eyes, however, were not on her. They were scanning the room, assessing his audience.

Cayden drifted over, a vision in a silk dress that cost more than Aracely' s monthly expenses. ""Gage, stop it. You're embarrassing her,"" she said, her voice a soft reprimand. She squeezed Aracely' s arm. ""Don't mind him. He's just so proud of you.""

The words were kind, but the look in Cayden's eyes was anything but. It was a look of pity, edged with triumph.

Later, Gage cornered her near the terrace. The smile was gone from his face. ""What's wrong with you tonight?""

""Nothing,"" Aracely said, her voice small. ""I'm fine.""

""You don't look fine. You look terrified. You're making me look bad,"" he hissed, his grip tightening on her elbow. ""My parents are here. Do you have any idea how important this is? Just smile and look grateful.""

""Grateful for what?"" The question slipped out before she could stop it.

Gage' s jaw clenched. ""For everything. For this."" He gestured vaguely at the opulent ballroom. ""Do you think you'd ever be in a place like this without me?""

The humiliation was a physical thing, a hot flush that crept up her neck. Before she could answer, Cayden appeared at Gage's side, placing a delicate hand on his ch**t.

""Gage, let's not make a scene,"" she said smoothly. She turned to Aracely, her expression one of deep concern. ""Are you feeling okay, Ara? You seem a little overwhelmed. Maybe you should get some air.""

It was a dismissal, expertly delivered. They were a team, a united front against her. As they walked away, Gage's hand slid from Cayden's shoulder down to the small of her back, a casual, in**mate gesture that screamed ownership.

Aracely stood there, a ghost at the feast, and understood. Her fairytale was a lie. Her best friend was a snake. And her prince was the villain of the story. The only thing she had left that was truly hers was her thesis. It was more than a paper; it was her declaration of independence. And she would guard it with her life.


Chapter 2
The glittering chandeliers of the gala seemed to mock Aracely as she watched Gage and Cayden across the room. They weren't hiding it anymore. Gage' s arm was wrapped firmly around Cayden's waist, his fingers splayed possessively against the curve of her hip. Cayden, in turn, had her head tilted back, laughing at something he whispered in her ear, her hand resting on his arm. They looked effortless, natural. They looked like a couple.

More than a couple. They looked like they belonged in this world of polished marble and hushed wealth in a way Aracely never would. The whispers started around her, quiet but sharp enough to cut.

""I don't know why she stays with him.""

""Look at them. It's so obvious.""

""She must know. She' s just holding on for the money. Pathetic.""

Aracely felt her hands clench at her sides. She remembered the early days of their relationship, when she had confronted Gage about a flirty text message. She had yelled, cried, and made a scene. He had turned it all back on her, calling her hysterical and jealous, making her feel like the crazy one. He' d enjoyed her tears. She learned then that her only defense was a quiet, dignified silence. So she stood straight, lifted her chin, and pretended not to hear the whispers, pretended not to see the man she loved se**cing her best friend in plain sight.

Gage glanced over at her, a flicker of something-annoyance? satisfaction?-in his eyes. He seemed pleased that she wasn't causing a scene, that she was taking her humiliation quietly like she was supposed to. He started to walk toward her, a condescending smirk playing on his lips, ready to deliver another lecture on her behavior.

Aracely didn't give him the chance. She turned on her heel and walked out of the ballroom, the heavy doors closing behind her with a soft, final thud.

The cool night air was a relief against her hot skin. She called for a ride-share, her fingers trembling slightly as she typed. She just wanted to go back to the dorm, to the one place that was supposed to be her sanctuary.

A sleek black car pulled up to the curb before her ride arrived. The tinted window slid down, revealing Gage behind the wheel, his expression impatient.

""Get in,"" he commanded. It wasn't a request.

Aracely' s first instinct was to refuse, to tell him to go to h**l. But then she saw the passenger seat. Cayden was sitting there, a smug little smile on her face as she pretended to be absorbed in her phone.

Gage followed Aracely's gaze and scowled. ""Don't even think about it. The front seat is Cayden's.""

As if on cue, Cayden looked up, her eyes wide and innocent. ""Oh, Ara, I'm so sorry. I get terribly carsick in the back. Do you mind? I can get out if it's a problem.""

She made a slight motion as if to open the door, but her body remained perfectly still. It was a masterful performance.

Gage' s scowl deepened as he turned back to Aracely. ""Don't make this difficult. Just get in the back before you cause another scene.""

The unspoken threat hung in the air: Or you can walk home.

Aracely said nothing. She walked around the car and opened the back door, sliding onto the cold leather seat. The car smelled of Gage' s cologne and Cayden' s cloyingly sweet perfume. They were a suffocating combination.

As Gage pulled away from the curb, Cayden reached over and ran her fingers along his jawline.

""Is that a new aftershave? I love it,"" she murmured, her voice husky. Her long, delicate fingers traced the sharp line of his chin, and Aracely could hear the soft rasp of his five-o'clock shadow against her skin. His breathing hitched.

Their eyes locked in the rearview mirror for a moment, a silent, charged conversation passing between them. Aracely felt a wave of nausea. She looked out the window, focusing on the blur of streetlights, trying to pretend she was anywhere else.

Just as their faces were leaning closer, a loud thud echoed through the car.

Gage looked into the rearview mirror, his brow furrowed in irritation. The back seat was empty. It took him a second to realize the sound had been Aracely slamming the car door shut.

He slammed on the brakes, the tires screeching. ""What the h**l?""

He threw the car in park and jumped out, storming over to where Aracely stood on the sidewalk. ""Where do you think you're going?""

Aracely pointed to the modest sedan that had just pulled up behind them. ""My ride is here. I don't need yours.""

Gage stared at her. For the first time, he seemed to see that her silence tonight wasn't submission. It was something else, something he didn't recognize. But his arrogance quickly reasserted itself. This was just another one of her games, a new way to get his attention.

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small, velvet box. He shoved it into her hand. ""Stop with the drama. Put this on. You're my girlfriend. You're embarrassing me.""

It was a bracelet, a thin silver chain with a single, tiny diamond chip. It was the kind of generic, thoughtless gift one buys out of obligation.

Aracely looked from the cheap bracelet to his face. ""Who is your girlfriend, Gage? Is it me? Or is it her?""

His expression flickered between annoyance and a strange sort of pride that she'd figured it out. He let out a short, humorless laugh.

""Don't flatter yourself by comparing you to her,"" he said, his voice dropping to a low, cruel wh**per. ""Cayden is kind and sweet. She knows her place. You should learn from her."" He leaned in closer. ""Now, if you ever mention this to my parents or try to hurt her, I will make sure you not only lose your scholarship, but that you never work in this city again. Understand?""

Aracely almost laughed. He wanted it both ways. He wanted to keep his perfect, doting girlfriend and his brilliant, scholarship-student accessory. He wanted to be the hero of his own story without having to be a good man.

She said nothing. She simply turned, got into her ride-share, and left him standing on the curb.

On the way back to the dorm, she opened her phone. Cayden had just posted a new photo. It was a close-up of her wrist, adorned with a stunning, intricate diamond tennis bracelet. It glittered under the soft light, a constellation of tiny, perfect stars. The caption was simple: ""Some nights are just magical.""

Aracely recognized it instantly. It was from a boutique jewelry store they had passed last week. Gage had complained about the price, but Cayden had stared at it with undisguised longing. The anonymous buyer was no longer a mystery.

Aracely looked down at the cheap little trinket still clutched in her hand. It wasn't just a gift; it was an insult. It was a measure of her worth in his eyes.

Her phone buzzed. It was a text from Cayden.

""The one who isn't loved is the third wheel. You've had your turn playing the part of Gage's girlfriend for years. It's my turn now.""

The message was clear. The game was over. They weren't even pretending anymore.


Chapter 3
The betrayal wasn't a clean break; it was a slow, festering wound. For days, Aracely walked through the campus like a ghost, the memory of Cayden' s text message branded into her mind. She thought about the countless times Cayden had ""helped"" her pick out an outfit for a date with Gage, subtly steering her toward something less flattering. She remembered the times Cayden had ""forgotten"" to pass on a message from him, causing arguments that always ended with Aracely apologizing. It had all been a calculated, long-term campaign of sabotage.

The hurt was deep, but beneath it, something else was taking root: a cold, hard resolve. She had wasted enough time and tears on Gage Barton and Cayden Padilla. They had taken her love and her friendship and twisted them into weapons against her. They would not take her future.

She threw herself into her thesis with a ferocity that bordered on obsession. Her topic was a complex analysis of emerging market economies, a subject that made most undergraduates'  eyes glaze over. But for Aracely, the intricate data sets and economic models were a sanctuary. They were logical. They followed rules. They couldn't lie or betray her. This thesis wasn't just an academic requirement; it was her magnum opus, the key that would unlock a door to a Ph.D. program at an Ivy League school, a world far away from Westbrook University and its petty tyrants.

One afternoon, sitting in a packed lecture hall for an elective on ethical governance, she found an unlikely source of inspiration. The guest lecturer was Professor Eldridge Patterson. He was young for a full professor, with a quiet intensity that commanded the room more effectively than any booming voice ever could. He was also, as campus gossip had long established, Gage Barton's older, more reclusive cousin.

Where the Bartons were new money, loud and insecure, the Pattersons were old money, so established they had no need for ostentation. Eldridge Patterson possessed an easy confidence that Gage could only imitate with bluster. He spoke with a clarity and passion that made the dry subject matter fascinating.

At the end of the lecture, he posed a complex hypothetical question to the hall. A heavy silence fell. Students shuffled their feet and avoided his gaze. Aracely' s heart began to pound. She knew the answer. It connected directly to a niche theory she had researched for her thesis.

Hesitantly, she raised her hand.

""Yes, Miss Adkins,"" Professor Patterson said, his eyes finding hers. He knew her name.

She stood and delivered her answer, her voice gaining strength and confidence as she laid out her reasoning. When she finished, the hall was silent for a beat, and then the professor smiled. It was a small, genuine smile of pure intellectual appreciation.

""That,"" he said, his gaze still fixed on her, ""is exactly right. A brilliant analysis.""

For the first time in weeks, Aracely felt a warmth spread through her ch**t that had nothing to do with shame or anger. It was the feeling of being seen, not as Gage Barton's girlfriend, but as herself.

Fueled by that small moment of validation, she worked tirelessly. The thesis grew, chapter by chapter, becoming a formidable piece of academic work. It was the best thing she had ever written. Her escape was so close she could taste it.

One evening, deep in the library's quietest corner, she decided to take a short break. Her back ached, and her eyes were burning from staring at the screen for hours. She packed up most of her things but left her laptop, logged in and open to her thesis draft, while she went to the small café downstairs for a coffee. She was only gone for ten minutes.

When she returned, her coffee in hand, she sat down and looked at her screen. Everything seemed normal. But when she moved the mouse, the document blinked. The page count at the bottom read: 1 of 1.

Her bl**d ran cold.

She frantically scrolled. Nothing. One hundred and twelve pages of research, analysis, and writing-gone. Vanished. She checked the backups. The cloud save. The external hard drive. Every file was corrupted. Wiped clean with a brutal, deliberate efficiency.

It was a digital assassination. A gaping black hole where her future used to be. And she knew, with a certainty that settled like ice in her stomach, who had pulled the trigger.


Chapter 4
The panic was a physical assault, a cold fist clenching in Aracely' s ch**t, stealing her breath. She clicked furiously, her hands shaking so badly she could barely control the mouse. She ran recovery software. She checked the version history. Nothing. It was all gone, replaced by a void. The emptiness on the screen was a perfect reflection of the hollowed-out feeling inside her.

But the panic soon gave way to something else. A rage so pure and cold it sharpened her thoughts into a single, piercing point. This wasn't a random glitch. This was an attack.

She had always been cautious, paranoid even. A few months ago, after noticing her laptop battery draining faster than usual, she had installed discreet monitoring software. She had almost forgotten about it. Now, she pulled up the logs, her heart hammering against her ribs.

There it was. A login entry, time-stamped just seven minutes ago. The user had accessed her thesis document, initiated a multi-pass deletion protocol designed to make data unrecoverable, and then corrupted the backup files. The IP address was the university's library Wi-Fi, but the user ID was unmistakable: C.Padilla.

Aracely didn't run. She walked out of the library with a terrifying calm and headed straight for their dorm room.

She pushed the door open without knocking. The scene inside was sickeningly familiar. Gage was lounging on Cayden's bed, scrolling through his phone. Cayden was at her desk, humming to herself as she applied a fresh coat of nail polish. They both looked up, startled by her abrupt entrance.

""God, Ara, you scared me,"" Cayden said, waving her wet nails in the air. ""What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

Aracely ignored her. Her eyes were locked on Gage. ""Did you know?"" she asked, her voice flat.

Gage looked up from his phone, annoyed. ""Know what? Don't be so dramatic.""

""My thesis. It's gone. Deleted.""

Cayden gasped, her hand flying to her mouth in a perfect pantomime of shock. ""Oh my god, Aracely, no! All your work! How did that happen?""

Aracely finally turned her gaze to her roommate. ""You tell me.""

Cayden' s eyes widened, filling with practiced tears. ""What are you implying? That I had something to do with it? How could you even think that?""

""Because I have the logs, Cayden. Your user ID, logged into my laptop, deleting my work, seven minutes ago.""

The color drained from Cayden's face. Gage sat up, his expression shifting from boredom to anger.

He got off the bed and stood in front of Cayden, shielding her. ""That's a crazy accusation. You probably deleted it yourself and forgot, you've been so stressed out lately.""

""Don't insult my intelligence, Gage,"" Aracely said, her voice dangerously low.

""It's just a st**id paper!"" he exploded, his voice echoing in the small room. ""My dad could make one phone call and get you into any grad school you want. You don't need some dumb thesis to prove you're smart. This is what you do, you make everything a huge drama!""

The cruelty of his words hit her harder than a physical blow. He didn't just not care; he actively despised her ambition. It was a threat to his control over her.

""Maybe you're just not as brilliant as you think you are,"" he added with a sneer. ""Maybe you couldn't finish it, so you're blaming Cayden to save face.""

That was it. The last thread of her affection for him snapped.

Aracely' s gaze drifted to Cayden's desk. Her laptop was open, displaying Cayden' s final project for her art history class-a meticulously curated digital portfolio. Beside it sat a large, full glass of water.

With a movement so swift and deliberate it seemed to happen in slow motion, Aracely picked up the glass.

""No, wait-"" Cayden shrieked.

Aracely upended the glass, and a cascade of cold water washed over the keyboard. The screen flickered, sparked, and went black. A wisp of acrid sm**e curled into the air.

Cayden stared in horror, her mouth hanging open. ""My project! It's all on there! It's due tomorrow!""

Aracely looked from the dead laptop to Cayden's devastated face, then to Gage's stunned expression. She felt nothing but a cold, satisfying calm.

She repeated Gage's words back to them, her voice devoid of emotion. ""It's just a st**id project. Why are you making such a big drama out of it?""

She turned and walked to her side of the room, pulled a duffel bag from her closet, and began stuffing clothes into it.

""What are you doing?"" Gage demanded.

""I'm done,"" Aracely said, not looking at him. ""We're done.""

She zipped the bag, slung it over her shoulder, and walked to the door. She didn't look back. She didn't need to. She could feel their hate-filled stares on her back, and it felt like freedom.",3,1760706092.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,5,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1o90ls7,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1o90ls7/could_cutting_back_on_caffeine_really_give_you/,Could cutting back on caffeine really give you more vivid dreams?,"Article in [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/could-cutting-back-on-caffeine-really-give-you-more-vivid-dreams-heres-what-the-science-says-262687) about the consequences of quitting caffeine :

""Have you recently cut down on caffeine and feel like you’re having the most vivid dreams of your life?

While there are a number of potential benefits of reducing our caffeine intake – such as whiter teeth and fewer trips to the toilet – we often hear one downside of cutting back on caffeine is the emergence of vivid (and sometimes scary) dreams.

It’s a strange and specific effect that many people say kicks in within days of reducing caffeine intake.

But is there actually any science behind this? Let’s look at what the research can tell us. Caffeine is a stimulant that makes us feel alert and awake. It works by blocking a chemical in our brain called adenosine.

Adenosine usually builds up during the day while we’re awake and active. By the evening, the build-up of adenosine in our brains helps us to feel sleepy. Adenosine gets cleared away while we sleep and we wake ideally feeling refreshed, ready for the adenosine to build up again.

When we have caffeine, it blocks adenosine’s signal. So, while the adenosine is still there, we don’t feel the sleepiness as strongly. When the caffeine wears off, our urge to sleep increases (the caffeine crash).

Caffeine has a half-life of around three to six hours, meaning half the caffeine we consume is still in our body after this time and, importantly, still affecting adenosine. That’s why, for many people, having caffeine in the afternoon or evening can make it harder to fall asleep at night.

By interfering with our adenosine signalling, caffeine can also make our sleep more disrupted and reduce the overall amount of sleep we get. This is especially true for our deep, restorative non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Overall, the research clearly shows the later we have caffeine and the more we have, the worse it is for our sleep.

There’s not a lot of direct research on whether cutting down on caffeine makes our dreams more vivid. Most studies focus on how caffeine affects sleep rather than what happens in our dreams.

But that doesn’t mean we’re totally in the dark. We know sleep quality and dreaming are closely linked.

Even though there’s no direct proof, people keep saying the same thing: they cut back on caffeine and within a few nights, their dreams start feeling more vivid, detailed, or just plain weird.

While cutting back on caffeine will not directly cause vivid dreams, there is a plausible link. Since caffeine can reduce total sleep and increase night-time wake-ups, especially when consumed later in the day, cutting back can let our body “rebound”. When we get more sleep, this can increase the amount of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep we get.

REM is a phase of sleep when our body is relaxed but our brain is very active. It’s also the stage of sleep associated with dreams. More REM sleep can mean more opportunity for our brain to produce vivid and elaborate dreams.

REM sleep is also the stage of sleep we are most likely to wake up from during the night, and if we wake up from REM sleep we are likely to remember our dreams, because they are “fresh” in our memory.

So, cutting back on caffeine can mean we get more REM sleep, which means more opportunity to dream and more opportunity to remember our dreams.

Of course, sleep is complex and so are dreams. Not everyone will suddenly have vivid dreams after ditching caffeine, and the effect might only last for a few days or weeks.

The bottom line is there’s not a lot of hard evidence linking cutting back on caffeine to vivid dreams, but there could be an association. Caffeine affects our sleep. Sleep affects our dreaming. And when we take caffeine out of the equation, or reduce it, this might give our brain a chance to spend more time in REM sleep.

When we think of caffeine, we commonly think of coffee and energy drinks. But caffeine can also be found in certain fizzy drinks, chocolate, tea, pre-workout supplements and medications.

Caffeine has a number of benefits, including for cognitive function and mental health. For example, some studies have shown coffee drinkers have a lower risk of depression, while caffeine has been associated with a reduced risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease. Coffee also contains B vitamins and antioxidants which are essential components of a healthy diet.

For shiftworkers, particularly those working at night, caffeine is often a way to manage fatigue. And even those of us who don’t do shift work may not be able to get stuck into the day’s tasks without that first (or second) cup of coffee.

If you’re not keen to cut out caffeine completely, but want to optimise your sleep, it’s all in the timing. Try avoiding caffeine for at least eight hours before bedtime, and steer clear of big doses within 12 hours of bedtime. Your sleep may thank you and your dreams may just surprise you.",4,1760705892.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

Tired but restless. Lonely but full of love. Idealistic but a little bruised from trying too hard in a world that often doesn’t meet you halfway. Because me too

I'm 26, based in Italy, and quietly hoping this message reaches someone who knows that life’s not just about chasing milestones but about finding someone whose soul feels like a safe place. 

Someone who won’t just get me, but who’s also walking through life with open eyes and an even more open heart.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, more just, more kind, I have to help make it that way. I believe in showing up, not just with words but with action. 

If you're indifferent to oppression or proudly neutral in the face of injustice, we won't click. I believe being kind doesn't mean being passive. I stand with Palestine, and if human rights aren’t a priority for you, we’re not meant for each other.

But this post isn’t just about politics. It’s about wanting to build something gentle and real with someone who's aware. 

Someone who knows that empathy is a muscle  one we grow by being present, listening deeply, and not turning away when things get hard.

About me:

- 6ft, slim build, dark eyes & darker humor (when sleep-deprived)

- Emotionally literate, sometimes overly so. I feel a lot. But I also care a lot.

- Deep thinker. Coffee lover on slow mornings. Volunteering makes me feel less helpless.

- I crave intimacy in the little things like shared playlists, lazy dinners, voice notes that go “so I was just thinking...”

Currently working and studying. Life is chaotic, but there’s beauty in the mess they say.


About you (maybe):

You believe love isn’t found in grand gestures but in consistency. Maybe you cry at movies and care about more than just your own world. You like vulnerable conversations, even the ones with no neat endings. You are thoughtful, curious, and want to grow with someone, not just date them.

Bonus if:

- You find bookstores romantic

- You speak your mind, but always with heart

- You hate bigots and refuse to normalize cruelty

- You love those quiet, late-night “what even is happiness?” kind of talks


What I want:

Nothing crazy, just someone sincere. A person I can be soft with who’ll meet me in the middle of all this trying. Maybe we find comfort in each other’s chaos. Maybe we just keep each other company in this strange, beautiful journey of figuring life out.

If any of this resonates, I'd like to get to know you. Tell me who you are when no one’s watching. Share your favorite lyric, your latest overthought idea, or just say hi :)",1,1760705802.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Tired but restless. Lonely but full of love. Idealistic but a little bruised from trying too hard in a world that often doesn’t meet you halfway. Because me too

I'm 26, based in Italy, and quietly hoping this message reaches someone who knows that life’s not just about chasing milestones but about finding someone whose soul feels like a safe place. 

Someone who won’t just get me, but who’s also walking through life with open eyes and an even more open heart.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, more just, more kind, I have to help make it that way. I believe in showing up, not just with words but with action. 

If you're indifferent to oppression or proudly neutral in the face of injustice, we won't click. I believe being kind doesn't mean being passive. I stand with Palestine, and if human rights aren’t a priority for you, we’re not meant for each other.

But this post isn’t just about politics. It’s about wanting to build something gentle and real with someone who's aware. 

Someone who knows that empathy is a muscle  one we grow by being present, listening deeply, and not turning away when things get hard.

About me:

- 6ft, slim build, dark eyes & darker humor (when sleep-deprived)

- Emotionally literate, sometimes overly so. I feel a lot. But I also care a lot.

- Deep thinker. Coffee lover on slow mornings. Volunteering makes me feel less helpless.

- I crave intimacy in the little things like shared playlists, lazy dinners, voice notes that go “so I was just thinking...”

Currently working and studying. Life is chaotic, but there’s beauty in the mess they say.

I’m not looking to replace my home setup, but I want a solid option for travel, camping, or quick coffee without hassle.

I’ve seen a lot of names thrown around like Picopresso, Wacaco, and OutIn Nano. My main concern is whether these devices actually produce good crema and espresso close to a countertop machine. I also want something that doesn’t require extra kettles or a lot of prep.

For those who’ve tested multiple portable espresso makers, what’s your take? Which ones truly deliver great flavor without making the process overly complicated?

I mean, out of all the FBI bunch/bureau, only four can actually be named, and only two are worth mentioning. There are only a few FBI agents, which is actually so confusing.

Instead of perhaps choosing the NPA/PSB, who actually have legal logistics and power in the country, Gosho is choosing a few FBI agents in hiding to actively work against the BO? What does that even mean? Instead of having Furuya make coffee all day, maybe he could participate in or actively work against the Organization.

Why are the currently powerless, illegally working FBI agents being utilized against the Organization? They seriously have nothing to work with, no authority, and are just pretty reckless. In some way or another, it’s helping the NPA because the Organization is too focused on the FBI, but I just think it’s pretty undeserving for the FBI to be the main law enforcement agency against the Organization.

When I opened it, the 3 way solenoid was all deformed from an internal short due to the top fitting being loose and leaking water.

https://preview.redd.it/11460k993ovf1.jpg?width=1560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e767890ebd05aef7d279e120e2030646abbb7af

I've now replaced the solenoid but when testing, turning the side knob to steam makes steam come out the group head instead.

I decided to test for voltage to this solenoid and I'm only getting 14 VAC no matter what function I try to use, but when I test power at the other solenoid I have 245 VAC when water pumping actions stop. I figured it might be something to do with the PCB (like a fuse or diode had blown) but the only thing I can find that looks suspect on the board is this capacitor.

https://preview.redd.it/27mgj1of0ovf1.jpg?width=1560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=39d36b3bd7589a775a2c541005a1c450ae145b5c

It has what looks like a light burn mark on the side and a very faint one on the top. There is another capacitor on the board with the exact same numbers on it but it doesn't have any of these marks.

https://preview.redd.it/8acdvr6y0ovf1.jpg?width=1560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc906b3e5f69ad9ec937a34aa04287af8314d9e5

My question is, do you think this would be the problem?

I did continuity tests between either of the capacitor pins to the orange wire that goes to the 3 way solenoid but neither had any connection. I've had capacitors blow before but usually they are really inflated or the top has been blown off, so I don't know if this is what one of these capacitors looks like when its dead. I was also not sure as the capacitor isn't located next to the wire that is missing power. The mark also won't rub off so it's not just dust or something like that.

I don't have a multimeter that can test capacitance but measuring the resistance of the ""good"" capacitor at the bottom of the picture it reads 542 Kohms but the ""blown"" one at the top of the picture has no continuity. I'm pretty sure this is the problem was just wanting a second opinion and to see if anybody has had to replace/has a link to where to buy these from.

It shows trees and flowers with a lot of different birds and animals as an elephant, a tiger, a lion, a deer couple. The rather odd shape of the deer antlers and the peculiar peacock design remind me of deer and peacocks on early 1900's Qajar Bakhtiari rugs from Tehran.

1o8zzcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1o8zzcq/house_review_toouch_vietnamese_niche/,House review: Toouch (Vietnamese niche),"Hello! I'm prompted to post this because I've just seen that Toouch fragrances are now available on Luckyscent. I often leave comments on here about Vietnamese brands, and people have asked me about Toouch from time to time, so I wanted to share my reviews.

Toouch (yes, I know it’s a stupid name) is a brand new Vietnamese niche perfume line. As soon as it launched, it piqued my interest because the nose behind the fragrances is Sy Truong, the perfumer better known for his Sylhouette range, and essentially Vietnam’s answer to Prin Lomros. Sylhouette is a daring, experimental premium niche line with fragrances that are both extremely high quality and pretty challenging. In 2024, Sy won an Art and Olfaction Award for his notorious perfume Molotov Cocktail (notes: gasoline, vodka, pepper; sweat, blood, rubber; metallic notes, iodine, musk, leather).

Toouch is an entirely different kettle of fish. It’s far more affordable, the scents are highly wearable, and there’s not an iodine note in sight. Since it launched a few months ago, it's been quite viral on Vietnamese social media. The first collection consists of five fragrances, all inspired by Vietnamese cities. 

Note on performance: I get about 6 hours of moderate projection from these. My part of Vietnam has a tropical climate with extremely hot, humid weather, so YMMV. Oh, and I should mention my personal bias: I'm a woman, and I generally favour feminine to unisex fragrances.

  
**Deep Lullaby**

Notes: pine, lavender, mojito; mulberry, wild rose, mimosa; tobacco leaf, charred wood, sandalwood

*(Deep Lullaby is inspired by the city of Da Lat in the Central Highlands. This is an incredibly beautiful city with cold winters, surrounded by forests, mountains, and waterfalls. You may recognise the name of the city because it also inspired one of D'Annam's scents.)*

I barely sniffed at this one in store – the notes aren’t really my thing, I’ve never met a tobacco rose I liked, and it sounded like it leaned masculine. But when I tried my sample at home…holy crap. Deep Lullaby is a revelation. It opens with a big hit of pine but, while so many pine scents seem determined to give you a photorealistic walk through a forest, this is more of a fantasy dreamscape. From the beginning, there’s this incredibly juicy quality to the fragrance, something fruity and edible lurking right under the pine.

Thanks to the mulberry, that juiciness stays as the pine fades and the tobacco rose duo takes over – and you know what? I actually like this take on tobacco rose. It’s deep and rich, and the tobacco is applied with a deft, light touch. This to me is very much an evening scent, and it’s for an evening when I want to feel dramatic and bold. Deep Lullaby is mature, and I don’t mean that in any kind of disparaging way (I’m 38, I want to smell mature!); I mean it’s sexy and confident. It’s hard for me to find perfumes I like in the “date night” part of my collection, but Deep Lullaby has definitely earned a place there. **5/5**

**Creamy Tide**

Notes: lychee, peach; rice milk, apple flower; iris, benzoin, white musk, vanilla

*(Creamy Tide is inspired by Can Tho, the biggest city in the Mekong Delta. That’s a major agricultural region, with fertile soil that’s perfect for growing all kinds of fruit and veggies – and, of course, rice, the staple of every Vietnamese table.)*

oft and powdery, Creamy Tide has the comforting quality that you find in some gourmand perfumes. It opens with lychee, but it’s a slightly muted lychee, made creamy rather than zingy thanks to the rice milk. I can detect some florals in the background, but rice dominates. The rice milk lingers through the drydown, balanced by vanilla that brings a touch of sweetness while never becoming cloying. It’s gourmand but not sparkly marshmallow gourmand.

This is the one I was most excited by, but I was also kind of nervous. It contains two of my favourite notes ever – lychee and rice – and I was worried that it wouldn’t live up to my expectations. Well, it did. This is not a strong, sexy perfume like Deep Lullaby; it’s a hug in a bottle, a gently enveloping, soothing fragrance that tells you everything will be okay. It has become one of my go-to perfumes for bedtime, or for days when I’m feeling low and I need some comfort. Just wonderful. 5/5

**Dreamy Nautica**

Notes: apple juice, grapefruit; neroli, sea salt; aquatic note, metallic musk

*(Dreamy Nautica is inspired by Da Nang, the biggest city in Central Vietnam. Da Nang is known for its beaches, so unsurprisingly, this is an aquatic scent.)*

From the first moments, Dreamy Nautica is indeed very salty. Yes, there's apple juice, but don’t expect sweetness – it’s a dry apple without any sugar thrown in. After that, the sea notes take over. It’s a soft aquatic that definitely smells of the ocean, suitable for the hottest days here in Vietnam. It leans masculine, but not overwhelmingly so. I can wear it without giving the impression that I’ve just raided my boyfriend’s aftershave shelf.

Dreamy Nautica is pleasant, and I enjoy it, but there’s not a whole lot to it. It’s the slightest of all these fragrances; every other Toouch scent – and indeed, every other Sy Truong scent – feels original in some way. Dreamy Nautica doesn’t. For me, it’s the least exciting of the range. If you want an affordable but good quality aquatic, this would be a great choice, but don’t expect anything groundbreaking. **3/5**

**Smoky Graze**

Notes: cinnamon, coffee; almond, cocoa, turkish rose, honey; suede, amber, vanilla, praline

*(Smoky Graze is inspired by Saigon, aka Ho Chi Minh City, the biggest city in Vietnam and the country’s economic engine. It’s a huge city with plenty of things to do, but I approach Smoky Graze with caution, because Saigon smells really bad. Like, this is a big dirty city full of giant rats and roadside garbage fires. Luckily, Sy's interpretation is not literal...)*

Smoky Graze is very aptly named. It’s really, really smoky. It opens not as freshly roasted coffee, but as coffee bean that you’re actively in the process of roasting. Over an outdoor fire pit. The coffee notes here are incredibly dark and bitter. Personally, I’m not a coffee drinker, and I only really like it as a note in perfume when it’s quite soft and toned down. That’s really not the case here – this is an intense, extremely black coffee, the kind people reach for when they have the hangover from hell.

After an hour or so the coffee starts to die down, and I get dark chocolate praline with a hint of vanilla. It’s still quite bitter – a very dark chocolate – but it’s softened by the vanilla. At that point, Smoky Graze is rather enjoyable, but the opening is just so overwhelming. It definitely makes a statement, but it’s not really to my tastes. It's also significantly more unisex than the notes might suggest. If you’re into powerful, smoky, bitter coffee notes, go nuts – but please keep this one for winters only. **3/5**

**Heritage Nuzzle**

Notes: pear, osmanthus; green tea, camellia, muguet, jasmine; vetiver, cashmere musk, rosewood

*(Heritage Nuzzle is inspired by Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam. Hanoi has more of a traditional feel than Saigon, particularly in the French Quarter; there are a lot of colonial-era buildings, old pagodas, and other beautiful sights.)*

This is one for hot days: a soft green tea with a little bit of fruitiness and some gentle jasmine. As a connoisseur of tea scents, I can confidently say that Heritage Nuzzle is not specifically a jasmine tea; rather, it’s a green tea that you’re drinking near some jasmine flowers. As a warning, the jasmine is slightly indolic. With this mixture of notes, the indoles don’t take over, but if you’re sensitive to them, watch out.

Eventually, Heritage Nuzzle softens into a gentle musk. The tea notes perform well, though – better than many other fragrances in this particular genre. It’s a lovely fragrance, not quite as unusual and exciting as Deep Lullaby or Creamy Tide, but worthy of a full bottle for me. I often reach for it as an everyday fragrance, as it’s very suitable for our hot climate. **4/5**

**Final thoughts**

As you can see, I'm really impressed with Toouch's line-up, and my three bottles are all in regular rotation. Oh, and one important note: the brand is just about to launch its second collection. In fact, I'm going to the store tomorrow to see if the new samples are out yet.",3,1760704212.0,fragrance,1,0.81,False

My Revenue: unchanged. The Engagement: meh.
My motivation? Let’s just say my coffee was working harder than I was.

I wasn’t doing bad,things were fine. But that was the problem. They were just… fine.
Every new idea I had seemed to circle back to the same place: more effort, same result. We’ve all been at this point, right?

I tried everything the internet suggested the typical things we all already heard, more ads, different funnels, a “personal brand revamp”. I even spent an entire weekend renaming my services, convinced that a clever title would magically unlock growth. Spoiler: it didn’t.

One day, during a client call, I caught myself saying something like:

“We just need to identify the real gap before we build the solution.”

And then it hit me. I’d never actually done that for my own business.
I’d been so busy tweaking things on the surface that I’d ignored the structure underneath.
So I took a step back. No new ads, no new products. Just reflection, strategy, and focus.

Within a week, I finally saw what was holding everything back. And once I understood that, fixing it became surprisingly simple.

I had a sudden spike in blood pressure about a few weeks ago (it went up to about 160/110 because I had redbull, lots of coffee and I was stressing). I was able to get it under control naturally and my blood pressure has normalized to about 128/84.

The thing is, since that spike, I've been feeling kinda weird. My head's light, my eyes dizzish, and emotionally I just feel flatchy or like I'm not here. like my feelings or senses are numbed. Not spinning dizziness so much as a lingering sensation of lightheadedness or like I'm not all the way there.

I'm 28, no family history of high blood pressure, and I've already reduced caffeine, sugar, and salty foods. My heart rate's normal too.

Has anyone else found themselves getting this sort of residual dizziness or fogginess after an episode of BP? Is it blood flow regulation, nerves, or stress, or inner ear something?

Maybe someone will find it useful. No judgment.

I'll tell you right away about my current attitude toward working with Spirits: simply sitting and waiting for results is a bad idea. It can work, but very rarely and under certain circumstances. Basically, it's help, not a ""gift."" The Spirits help: they ""create the stage on which we perform."" And that's if you do everything correctly.

First experience and result:

I was in college and asked Gremory to help me start a romantic relationship with a classmate. I hadn't interacted with this girl before, and I'm not sure she even saw me or knew who I was. After contacting Gremory, this girl approached me, sat next to me during lectures, started conversations, and invited me to various events. I thought this girl would continue to be proactive and things would work out, but after a couple of days, it stopped. Then I realized that I had lost everything through my inaction. Gremory had given me opportunities I hadn't taken advantage of. But I considered this a success. A valuable lesson.

Second experience and result:

I was also in college and worked as a barista at a coffee shop. I had a regular customer, a girl from the university. The situation then continued as in the first experience, only this time I took action too. We started dating, but it turned out it wasn't what I wanted. Because I'm a 20-year-old lustful student. This girl was overly active, I would even say slightly obsessed with me. I felt sad and uneasy. I decided not to abuse her positive attitude towards me and didn't have sex with her, even though she brought it up many times. We broke up. The second lesson I learned: clearly formulate your intentions and the request you make to the Spirit.

I noticed that some Spirits grant what you ask for, even if you don't really need it. Some won't do anything if you don't really need it.

Overall impressions of working with Gremory:

I noticed that women objectively treated me better. I noticed I became more ""feminine,"" so to speak. Interacting with and understanding women became easier. I also started taking better care of myself and my body, focusing on my attractiveness. 

I also noticed that I started receiving various small gifts: somewhere in line, a girl would compliment me and buy me a drink, or I'd find money on the street, or a female teacher would free me from cleaning the classroom, and things like that.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

The fasting part was easy. The hydration part? Total mess.

I kept breaking my fast without meaning to. Not with food. With drinks. Lemon water (has calories), bone broth (definitely has calories), herbal tea with honey (why did I think this was okay?).

Also kept getting headaches around hour 14 or 15 of my fast. Thought it was hunger. Turns out: dehydration.

Here's the system I built:

Set up WaterMinder with specific fasting window reminders. 7am, 10am, 1pm, 4pm (my eating window starts at 5pm). Only logging black coffee, plain water, and black tea during fasting hours.

Goal: 2 liters before breaking fast. Another liter during eating window.

Added notes in the app for ""fasting safe"" versus ""not fasting safe"" drinks because I'd genuinely forget in the moment.

Results:

Headaches mostly gone. Turns out I was consistently under hydrated during fasting hours and mistaking it for hunger or low energy.

The app works better for this than I expected because I can customize reminder times around my fasting schedule. Though honestly, it's just a basic tracking tool. The real win was being conscious about it at all.

1o8zrm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o8zrm8/the_watchtower_part_two/,The Watchtower: Part Two,"It was around noon when I began to see signs of a town. An old, weathered windmill creaked and groaned in the calm gusts of wind. Along the sides of the road were old fences and even older barns. Everything looked like it was falling apart. Their roofs were gone and the walls looked like they would fall over at any moment. 

Just off the road was a dilapidated sign that said, ‘*Welcome to Judgment, Home of The Watchtower*’. 

A chill ran down my spine at the sight of the sign. The words ‘*The Watchtower*’ stood out to me in a way that I couldn’t quite explain. I couldn’t help but find myself staring idly at the massive stone column that rose above the town like an altar to an ancient deity.

“That thing must be The Watchtower,” I said.

“I suppose it is.” 

His tone was absent of emotion and I wondered what he was thinking. Was he worried for his sister?

“Hopefully we can find Lu right away, I…don’t want to stay here longer than I have to.”

“I agree. It’s…creepy out here,” Varo said. 

As we drove into Judgment, it became increasingly clear that there was not much to the town. There was a mainstreet that had a dozen or so buildings lining it. There looked to be a general store, a bar, a cafe, and a rather decrepit building that said ‘tourist info’ across the top of it.

Everything in the town was constructed from sun-bleached wood and didn’t appear to have been updated anytime recently. The town was dusty, sand had blown across much of the road, making it look more ghostly than necessary. 

I would have considered it to be abandoned if I hadn’t seen a handful of people walking around. They all had big smiles on their faces. One man even waved at us as we drove through. I glanced at Varo. If he was uncomfortable, he didn’t show it.

“How do they live like this?” I said. I might’ve spent the better part of my life moving around the country, often living in less-than-ideal situations. But this felt…barren. 

“I don’t know,” Varo said. “Look there,” he pointed to a building at the end of town, a large garage, constructed of rusted metal siding. 

The garage door looked like it hadn’t been open in ages. Beside it was a much smaller people-door. Letters across the top of it read, ‘*Judgment Auto and Towing*’.

“We should start there,” I said. “We need to find out if someone picked up Lu.”

Varo nodded and parked my car beside the entrance to the garage. I opened my door and stepped out into the gusty desert town. I looked around, wondering why the hell anyone would live out here. It looked more like the set to a Clint Eastwood movie than a real town.

Above me, The Watchtower loomed like an old god. Its white, dusty surface looked pale compared to its surroundings. Simply looking at it, sent a strange feeling into my core. 

Varo seemed disinterested in the strange town and even The Watchtower. In fact, he seemed to be purposefully avoiding looking at it. Instead, his attention was on the auto shop.

As I followed Varo into the shop, I found myself in a small office, separated from the rest of the garage. A middle-aged man sat at the desk, glancing between us with unabashed curiosity. His graying hair was mostly covered by a wide-brimmed hat. His eyes were a pale shade of gray. For a moment, he said nothing.

“Welcome,” he said as he cleared his throat. “How can I help y’all out today?”

“We’re looking for a woman named Lu,” I said. “According to my information, she called this company right before her phone died. I suspect she might have had car troubles.”

“A girl named Lu, huh?”

“Luciana,” Varo clarified.

The man stood and began to rummage through a collection of papers on his desk. I noticed that the nametag on his dirty, blue coveralls simply said ‘Coyote’. 

“Yeah,” he said as he held a piece of paper in front of his face. “Luciana Delgado.”

“That’s her,” I said. “Do you know if she’s still here?”

Coyote chuckled. “Well, I don’t see where else she’d be. Her car isn't fixed yet and it takes several days of walkin’ to reach the next town.”

“Thanks,” I said. “I don’t suppose you have any idea where she is?”

Coyote pointed a weathered finger at the door, in the direction of the mainstreet. “Probably down at the Cozy Snake. Don’t know where else she’d find a room.”

I let out a breath of relief and glanced at Varo. I was surprised to find that there were no obvious signs of relief across his face. Instead, he looked more tense than ever. 

“Thanks,” I said to Coyote.

I walked outside with Varo, surprised by his lack of enthusiasm. We had done it. His sister was safe in a motel only a few blocks from us. Why did he look so tense?

“Well,” I said with a grin. “We did it. Lu is alright.”

Varo forced a smile. “Thank you, Harper,” he said. “I’ll…be sure to buy your room and dinner tonight.”

I smiled as I walked down the street towards the motel, feeling accomplished. 

The Cozy Snake, a small, run-down motel. It had only a dozen rooms, one of which was being rented by Lu. After a brief talk with the woman at the front desk, Varo made his way to room number seven. He knocked on the door until it was answered by a petite, dark-haired woman with an assortment of piercings on her ears and nose.

Lu’s features softened the moment she saw Varo. The young woman threw her arms around him and let out a loud sob. 

“Varo,” she said quietly between sobs. “I didn’t think…I’m so sorry…I didn’t meant-”

“It’s alright,” he said gently.

The emotional scene made me suddenly aware of my lack-of-purpose at that moment. I waited uncomfortably as Varo attempted to console his sister.

“How the hell did you find me?” Lu finally asked as she pulled away from him.

“This is Harper,” he said with a gesture to me. “She’s a private investigator. I…I thought it was weird when I didn’t hear back from you after that fight with mom.”

Lu hesitated slightly as she flicked a piece of her shoulder-length hair out of her face. Her dark eyes found mine and she quickly looked away. 

“Thanks for coming to get me,” she said quietly. 

Her disposition had changed so suddenly, I felt like I had missed an important piece of the conversation.

“Always,” Varo said. 

There was an odd pause of silence that I felt needed to be interrupted. So, I said, “it sounds like your car is still getting worked on. I’ll book myself a room here for the night but since…we found you, I suppose I’ll be leaving in the morning.”

Varo glanced at me and back towards his sister. He pulled out a well-worn leather wallet and handed it to me. 

“It’s on me. I promised I’d pay, remember?”

“Right,” I grabbed the wallet. “Thanks.”

I left the two Delgado siblings alone in front of door number seven and walked to the front desk. I got the feeling that the two of them had personal matters to discuss. Since I had successfully fulfilled my end of the bargain and I had no problem letting Varo pay for my room.

The front desk was run by a mousy woman named Alma. She was likely about ten years my senior with ash-blonde hair and eyes that never quite met mine. 

“Hey,” I said as friendly as I could. “I’m back. I was hoping to get a room for the night.”

“Just one night?” Alma seemed mystified by this.

I nodded. “Yup, I’ve got a long way to go tomorrow, so just tonight.”

Alma nodded and wrote something down in a notebook. It seemed the motel was void of all technology. There wasn’t even a card-reader in sight. I opened Varo’s wallet hoping he had cash on him.

“That’ll be seventy dollars,” she said.

To my luck and mild shock, there was nothing in Varo’s wallet but three hundred dollar bills. I handed one of the bills to Alma, still gazing at the wallet in amusement. There were no credit cards, gift cards, or even a driver's license. I found it curious, but nothing more.

Alma handed me back the change as well as an old key. I thanked her and walked outside towards my car to gather my things. I grabbed the overnight bag I had backed and gazed out at the town around me.

A handful of people loitered in front of the bar. A man with a cigarette spoke loudly about having to work on a Saturday. The men around validated his frustration with a groan. Beside the man with a cigarette was Coyote, the mechanic. He wasn’t engaging in the conversation, however. Instead, he was staring at me.

I was about to walk to my room at the motel when I noticed Coyote shift and begin to walk across the street towards me. I let out a long sigh. *He better not be a creep*, was all I could think.

“Y’know I never caught your name, miss,” he said in a slow, casual manner.

“I’m Harper,” I said, extending my hand.

Coyote shook it. “They call me Coyote.” He pointed to his nametag.

“That’s quite the name.”

He laughed and said, “Yeah and I almost deserve it.”

“How is Lu’s car coming along?”

“Waitin’ on the parts.” He paused. “Say, you don’t have a moment to speak in private, do you?”

A wave of uncertainty passed over me. “I…I just got a room, but I’m sorry it’s been a long day. I need a moment to relax and-”

“If you were any kind of smart, you’d get in that car and leave this gods-forsaken town.” There was ice in his words. 

“I’m sorry, what?” I was too baffled by his sudden change in tone to fully comprehend what he was saying to me.

“Get in that car and go,” his voice was low but sharp.

“I just got a room. Besides, I plan to leave tomorrow.”

“It’ll be too late by then.”

“I-” 

“Leave the young lady alone,” a man joked as he slung an arm around Coyote’s shoulders. 

Coyote looked irritated but made no attempt to get away from the other man.

“Ophelia, I was beginning to think you actually did it,” the stranger addressed me. 

He was an odd-looking man with sunken-in eyes and pale hair. It was almost impossible to tell his age but from the way he carried himself, he appeared to be in charge–or at least thought he was.

“What?” I asked, confused by the strange remark. 

“This is Harper, Leon,” Coyote said with a groan. “She’s not from around here.”

“Oh,” a strange look crossed his face as if he was realizing something for the first time. “I see. It’s nice to meet you Harper. If you need anything, don’t hesitate to ask.”

“Thanks,” I said, taking a step away.

“Just consider what I said,” Coyote said quietly before following Leon back to the bar. 

He gave me one last glance before he walked up the steps towards the bar. The man who waited for him clapped him on the back and said something I couldn’t hear. For a brief moment, Coyote’s friend glanced at me with deep-set dark eyes. 

He was an odd-looking man with sallow features and white hair. There was something about him that made my skin turn clammy. I tried to ignore the feeling as I turned around.

*What the hell did Coyote mean? Why did he tell me to leave?*

I walked to my room, number six, and opened the door. I dropped my things on the ground and collapsed onto the bed. It was a shitty little motel, with a musty smell and stains on the carpet.

There were rose patterned curtains, bedsheets, and upholstery that rivaled a grandmother’s bedroom. Even the walls were what used to be a shade of baby pink. With time (and possibly some cigarette smoke) the walls were a sad shade of brown.

Despite the general filth of the room, laying down on a bed felt incredible. Before I had time to consider what Coyote had said to me, a knock came to my door. I stood up and opened it. Varo stood outside, watching me with a steady look.

“What did that old man say to you?”

I shrugged. “He told me I should leave…I don’t know, he was just drunk, maybe he’s not in the mood for tourists.”

“Maybe,” Varo hesitated for a moment. “Do you have my wallet?”

“Oh!” I had nearly forgotten about that. I handed him the wallet back. He was about to leave when I asked, “isn’t it a little odd to only be carrying cash around with you?”

He shrugged. “I don’t need anything else.”

“A driver’s license would come in handy,” I joked.

“Don’t have one.”

Before I could say anything, he walked away and disappeared into Lu’s room. *I let him drive my car and that bastard doesn’t even have a license*, was all I could think.

I fell asleep early that night but it was a restless sleep. My dreams consisted of pale figures, bloody floors, and pain. When I woke up my lower abdomen felt like it had been stabbed. I rolled around, wondering why the hell I was getting period cramps now of all times. It was early–too early–in the month for that.

With a groan, I got up and grabbed the Advil I had packed. I walked to the bathroom and put the pills in my mouth. When I went to fill up a cup with water, no water came from the faucet. Frustrated, I walked back into the room and found a half-finished soda I had brought up with me. I downed the pills with a bit of stale soda and laid back on the dusty bed.

As I laid there, waiting for the pain to subside, I decided that Judgment was an awful town. It was dirty and run-down. There was no water in the sink and Coyote had thoroughly scared the shit out of me. 

And then there was The Watchtower.

From my spot on the bed, I gazed towards the tiny window. The curtains were closed as much as I could close them. However, a little gap remained. In that gap, The Watchtower stood. In the darkness of the room, I gazed outside, staring at the strange structure. 

My stomach churned, just like it had when I had been forced to pull over. Only this time, I didn’t vomit, I just stared out at The Watchtower in silence. I wanted more than ever to go home.

“I only have to wait for the morning,” I said to myself. “Then I’ll be out of this backwards town.”

Eventually, I fell back asleep. 

When I woke up the next time, morning light poured in through the little window on my door. I woke slowly, thankful that the pain I had felt the night before was gone. I got dressed and attempted to brush my teeth, only to realize there was still no water.

I let out a sigh, grabbed my key, and left the room. I found Alma sitting behind the front desk, reading what looked to be a particularly steamy romance book. When she failed to notice me, I cleared my throat.

“Oh! Sorry, hun,” she said, putting the book cover down on the desk. “I didn’t see ya.”

“There’s no water in my room,” I said. I knew I was being rude but I was tired after such a weird night of sleep.

“Right,” she adjusted her glasses, still avoiding my eyes. “Well, that’s because the water truck hasn’t arrived yet. But don’t worry, it’ll be here by tonight.”

I blinked. “Water truck?”

“Judgment has no water. We’ve never had water. We have it shipped in like food or fuel.”

I had never heard of such a thing. I almost didn’t believe her. 

“We’ve got a big old tank on top of the motel,” Alma said cheerily. “Giant thing. Weighs a ton when it’s full. The truck will fill it up along with the rest of the shops’ tanks.”

“So, there’s no water in town right now?”

“Nope, but like I said, he’ll show up tonight. But if you’re feeling peckish, the general store will be open in a few minutes.”

“Alright,” I said with a sigh. “Thanks.”

As Alma suggested, the general store opened shortly after I arrived. It was small, hardly larger than most convenience stores. It had a wall of frozen food, a wall of refrigerated food, and several aisles of non perishables, toiletries, and medicine. 

The entire shop felt like it had been suspended in time. Nothing had been updated since the 1970s. All the refrigerators were old and well-worn. An old box TV sat behind the counter, playing what looked to be soap opera.

The store was small, but I was still surprised by their lack of supplies. There were no fresh veggies, no dairy, no dry goods for baking. All that appeared to be in stock was their meat selection. 

To give them credit, the meat looked phenomenal. It was fresh and came in a variety of cuts. Hell, most of it looked like far better quality than anything I got back at the deli in Phoenix. I couldn’t help but linger in the meat aisle, wondering why meat–out of everything–was so well-stocked.

Despite their incredible meat selection, there was no water. Not gallon jugs or cases of bottled water. There was nothing. I turned and walked to the front. A young boy stood behind the counter looking helplessly bored as the TV drama played on beside him. 

“Can I help you?” he asked in a monotone voice.

“Do you have any water?”

He looked genuinely surprised by the question. “Water?”

“Yes, like a gallon jug or something. It doesn’t have to be the nice stuff, I just need something.” I explained.

“Sorry,” he said. “Don’t have any of that.”

“Really?” I was surprised. 

“No, ma’am,” he said.

I nodded and left the shop, feeling angrier than I should have. No water in the motel, no water at the store. Coyote was right to tell me the town was *god-forsaken*. I was beginning to understand.

When I made it back to The Cozy Snake, I found Varo lingering outside on the front steps, smoking a cigarette. He gave me a slight nod as I approached and handed me a styrofoam cup.

“Figured you might want some coffee.”

I clutched the warm cup, suddenly grateful. “Thanks.” I took a sip and instantly half of the irritation I felt lifted away from me. “This is a weird town,” I said after a moment.

Varo blew out a cloud of smoke and shrugged.

“There’s no water here. They bring it in on trucks, I guess. Isn’t that strange?”

“It’s unusual, but I’m sure the water is on its way. No one can live without water.”

I realized then that I was overreacting. I took another sip of the coffee and attempted to calm my nerves. 

“So,” I said after a moment. “I’m gonna try and pack up and head out within the next hour. I kinda figured you’d wait with Lu but-”

“You might want to hold off on leaving,” Varo said. 

His dark eyes drifted past me and focused in on the distant horizon.

I turned around to see what he was looking at. The skies were a hazy shade of tan and brown. 

“Fuck,” was all I could say.

Varo smirked as he took another drag of the cigarette. “It’s best to wait out dust storms. It’s hard to tell how bad it’ll be. There’s no cell service out here if you were to run into a problem.” I stared at the approaching storm in disbelief. No water, no cell phone service, and an approaching storm–I didn’t know if I could hate a place any more than I hated Judgment.

Unbeknownst to me, dust storms were cause for celebration in the town of Judgment. And by ‘celebration’, I mean excessive drinking. From what I gathered most of the town had decided to hunker down in the bar while the storm passed. According to a handful of folks, it was something of a tradition.

Whisker’s Whiskey was the only bar as well as the only restaurant in all of Judgment. With the storm approaching quickly, we all found ourselves sitting together in the restaurant. It wasn’t my idea to join the crowd, but according to Alma, the motel would be ‘uncomfortable’ during a dust storm. 

I wasn’t willing to wait around and figure out what she meant by that.

A group of kids played a board game on the floor while adults stood or sat in groups talking. A line of old men sat at the bar, drinking to their heart's content. Coyote and his white-haired friend were among them. I sat with Varo and Lu at a small table that was intended for only two. My knees kept bumping into theirs.

“Thank you, Harper,” Lu said as she sipped on her cup of soda. “Sorry you’re trapped here, now.”

“It’s alright,” I said as I sipped my rather strong gin and tonic. “It’s part of my job,” I shrugged.

“So, you’re a *real* private investigator? That must be so fascinating,” Lu pressed on.

I laughed. “Not as much as you’d assume. I mean, it has its moments but most of the time, things are pretty straight forward. People are…predictable.”

“You’re like a real Sherlock Holmes,” Lu said more to herself than to me.

I said nothing. I hated that comparison, but I was never really sure why.

“Was I hard to find?”

“Not particularly,” I said. “The only strange part has been this town…and your motivations for going someplace so far from home.”

Lu shot a glance at Varo and then back at me. “Well, I was born here,” she said matter-of-factly. “So, I don’t think it’s that far of a stretch to assume-”

“I’m sorry, what?” I was now focused more on Varo than I was on Lu. “She was *born* here?”

“I…I may have failed to mention that detail,” was all Varo said in his defense.

“I usually call that *withholding information*.”

“You’re not a cop,” he raised an eyebrow and finished off the double-shot of whiskey he had been nursing for over an hour.

“No,” I said. “But why wouldn’t you tell me about this town? You acted like you had never heard of Judgment. You didn’t need me, you could have found Lu on your own. Why the *hell* did you bring me here?” 

At some point while I yelled at Varo, I stood up. The bar had quieted significantly by the time I finished what I had to say. Varo watched me silently. He seemed unable to come up with a suitable answer.

“Listen, Harper, I-”

“Fuck this,” I said as I walked across the now-quiet bar. 

I opened the door and rushed outside into the bitter, desert storm. Sand stung my skin but I forced myself to run towards where I had parked my car.

I found the old sedan and jumped in, starting it up quickly. It started and the air vents kicked dust and sand into the cab. I coughed and turned off the vents. I gazed out the window, realizing the visibility was just as terrible as I imagined it. 

However, I could still see the road. So, I gripped the wheel hard and pulled out onto the street.

The wind whipped around me like a monster wanting to get into my car. It howled and shook the old vehicle. The wheel tugged in my hands, the car felt like it was magnetically drawn towards the ditch. However, I refused to give into fear. I needed to get out of this wretched place.

I could only make out just enough of the road to see about twenty feet ahead of me. I stared at the wall of golden dust and hoped that it was near its end. 

I don’t know how long I drove for. Every muscle was tense as I drove through that storm, my eyes strained to see through the dusty skies. I think if I would have waited just a little longer in Judgment, I would have had a better chance. But like so many things, the odds were stacked against me. 

Judgment did not want me to leave.

Just as I was beginning to feel more comfortable with the road conditions, a giant object emerged from the dust. It was an elk. I swerved slightly to avoid hitting the animal. My right tire was suddenly caught by something on the side of the road and I lost control of the car.

My world went black.

*The entire town was there, standing under the shadow of The Watchtower. They were dressed in loose sand-colored cloaks. Their hoods were pulled up so far over their heads, I could hardly see their eyes. While their robes matched the landscape, my dress matched the giant stone behind me.*

*I stood in front of the crowd, the great white monolith behind me. I was terrified. My heart beat so fast I thought I was going to be sick or pass out. Beside me was one of the cloaked figures. He held my arm so hard, I was certain it would bruise.*

*I wasn’t listening to the words he was speaking, but the crowd seemed enraptured by whatever he was saying. I was trying desperately to see anyone I knew.* 

*Were my parents there?* 

*My friends?* 

*Would they help me?* 

*Would they stop this?*

*I got no answers to my questions.*

*“Today, our young Ophelia will walk into The Watchtower a girl and return a woman,” the man beside me said as he raised his hand upwards.*

*The crowd bowed to one knee in unison. I could hear my heart beating in my ears. I continued to search the crowd for someone, anyone to help me. At the outskirts of the group, someone was looking up under their hood. Her eyes found mine.*

*Carmen.* 

*She stared at me with the fear of a mother. But there was more than just fear in her eyes–there was anger. She clutched her young son tight against her chest. He was watching me too, confused as to what was happening.* 

*As I stared into Carmen’s eyes, I saw a tear slip down her cheek. I didn’t want her to cry. I liked Carmen. She was friends with my parents and she always invited me over to watch old movies with her son. I couldn’t understand why she was crying.*

*Beside me, the man who held my hand said, “Ophelia, do you accept the gift you have been given?”*

*“I do,” I had practiced this part a hundred times.*

*“And how will you accept it?”*

*“Under the watch of our ancestors,” I recited.*

*“From birth comes life.”*

*“And from life comes death,” I replied.*

*I had to tear my eyes away from Carmen’s. She was making me feel worse. It was an honor to be chosen.*  

*“Turn,” the man said quietly.*

*I turned to face The Watchtower. Behind me the crowd was silent.*

*“Go forth to serve the ones who give us life.”*

*I stepped closer to the towering structure. At its base was a narrow crack in the stone. I knew I was meant to enter, but now fear was catching up to me. However, if I faltered, there would be punishments. I knew that well-enough to force myself to keep walking.*

*As I approached the great stone, tears were flowing freely down my face. I wanted my parents. I wanted to go home. I didn’t want this.*",2,1760703595.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1o8zqs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1o8zqs7/aitah_for_throwing_off_my_husbands_routine/,AITAH for throwing off my husband's routine?,"My husband and I are both autistic. We both like some level of routine. 

He has an alarm set for 6am, has to leave for work at 7:30am. Most mornings, he's still in bed at 7:15am and has to rush out with just a protein shake, other mornings he's in the bathroom pooping until 7am, then either rushes to make a very quick breakfast, or again- protein shake. Very rarely, he wakes up and makes breakfast, but he strongly prefers actual breakfast over the shakes and gets irritated with himself when he's stuck with just a shake. 

Usually, when he's in the bathroom past 6:45, I'll make breakfast. 

This morning, I was already awake and making my breakfast, so I made his as well. 7am rolls around, he's not out of bed yet, I bring him coffee and breakfast (he usually eats breakfast in bed). 

Mind you, I did the same thing yesterday and he had zero problem with it. I've done this at least once a week, and the closest thing to a problem he had was toast being a little crispy because we had a new toaster that neither of us figured out the settings on yet. 

Today, he eats 2 bites then just stares into the distance for a few minutes. Then pushes the food away (knocking half of it onto the bed) and starts groaning. Mumbles something about routine. 

Then somewhat angrily (he says it's not his angry voice, but he only uses that tone when he's extremely pissed or irritated) says ""every morning I make breakfast. This throws off my routine"" (by every morning, he means maybe 2 mornings a week- usually days off) 

Now we're both irritated because I have to spend my day washing the sheets and both comforters, because they had food on them. And he says he can't eat because his routine was thrown off- not even a protein shake or bar. 

He got out of bed at 7:10am to go to the bathroom, so he wasn't going to make breakfast anyways. 

I fully understand the importance of routine, especially for him- but his routines usually start after work. The most consistent thing about his morning ""routine"" is snoozing his alarm repeatedly and running late for work.

So AITAH? Am I supposed to just... make my own breakfast and let him be stuck with the protein shakes he barely tolerates but chooses anyways? ",2,1760703522.0,AITAH,22,0.75,False

It has been a long, bumpy, and windy road, but we got here in the end. 😊

I liken this journey to one that I had driving through Road to Hana… a slow ride with barely a foot to spare before the cliff, constantly keeping an eye on the side of the mountain to avoid falling rocks… and when a busload of people are coming at you because you decided to go against the recommend flow of traffic… you end up having to reverse and reassess your position, but still keep moving forward. ☺️

Just like this series, even though the drive was hard and exhausting, the trip was well worth it because there were stops where we get to appreciate the beauty… the bamboo forest, waterfalls, greenery, and the ocean surrounding the island.🏝️ 🌊

Thank you for staying with me all throughout… buckling your seatbelts and holding to whatever you can grab onto every single week. It would’ve been a really lonely ride otherwise. 🥹

We are opening the floor for everyone to discuss the episode in detail, if they so prefer. I still encourage everyone to use GIFs just because they’re always fun. 😊

Any written out comments, have them in English please so our global friends won’t feel left out from the conversation. 👍🏼

Get your snacks (breakfast) and preferred beverage ready (coffee for me) and let’s give Tawan and Ayla’s story a proper send off! ☕️🍻🥳

Hey y’all! I’m 25, female, from Georgia (US), and really hoping to develop some genuine friendships with other women! I’m super quiet like… 90% of the time, but once I warm up, I love talking shit and laughing about the most random things.

I’m currently in school for my RN, so I get busy and disappear sometimes, but I promise I come back. I love horror, dark humor, and I’ve got 10 tattoos of completely random stuff (none of them make sense, and that’s kind of the point).

I’m southern, into sarcasm, iced coffee, late night venting, and people who can hold real conversations without being weird. I’m not looking for anything romantic — just chill, funny, supportive friends who get the chaos of adulting, school, and trying to keep your sanity intact.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.
