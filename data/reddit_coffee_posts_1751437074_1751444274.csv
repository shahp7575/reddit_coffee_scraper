Let’s share small things, like the weather where we are or what our coffee orders say about our personality. I think the best friendships start when you stop trying to impress anyone and just let things flow. I’m open to talking about life, movies, music, weird facts, or whatever random thought pops into your head at 3AM.

1lpqbey,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lpqbey,Skipping Khamrah + Qahwa for Royal Blend Nero + French Coffee Oil — Smart Upgrade or Just a Workaround?,"So here’s my setup: I was planning to get Lattafa Khamrah and Khamrah Qahwa, but after doing some digging, I realized I might be better off skipping both entirely.

Instead, I’m thinking of going with:

👉 Royal Blend Nero (French Avenue ) — which hits that boozy apple-cinnamon Khamrah vibe but supposedly smoother, more refined, and stronger performing.
+
👉 A good French Coffee attar/roll-on (like Al Rehab or whatever’s strong) to layer when I’m in the mood for a deeper coffee gourmand vibe.

Basically, this setup lets me dial in either a dessert-rich boozy scent (Nero alone), or layer the French Coffee for something stronger than Qahwa ever did. The flexibility sounds better than being locked into two bottles that might overlap or underperform.

Question is — do y’all think this is a legit upgrade, or am I just coping with a workaround?

🧠 I’m not into hype-chasing or collecting for shelves. I want realistic versatility and power, not sugar bombs that fade in 2 hours.

Would love to hear if anyone has worn both sides and can compare. Especially if you’ve tried Royal Blend Nero AND Qahwa/Khamrah.

Cheers!

The kind of morning where the sky feels too heavy, and you wake up already exhausted. My heater had given out overnight, and I could see my breath in the air. My landlord wouldn’t answer my texts. My bank account was $12.39. My car hadn’t started in two days. I was unemployed, single, and alone.

I remember sitting on the floor of my apartment, wrapped in two blankets, holding a mug of cold instant coffee, just staring at the wall. I thought to myself, This is it. This is my life now. A slow slide into nothing.

At around 11AM, my phone rang. Unknown number. Normally I’d let it go to voicemail, but something told me to pick up.

“Hi,?”  
“Yes… who’s this?”  
“This is XYZ from the XX Foundation. We’ve been trying to get in touch with you. You applied for our creative writing grant last year. There’s been a clerical mix-up, and well congratulations. You’ve been awarded the 2024 Emerging Writer’s Fund. That’s $15,000 to support your writing.”

I swear I thought it was a scam. I made her repeat it twice. I had actually forgotten I applied at all. But it was real. I got the email confirmation within the hour. I cried like a child. I screamed in my cold apartment.

And here’s the kicker: that grant came with a 6-month mentorship under a published author. That mentor? Offered me a job. I’m now a junior editor at a small press in New York. I moved last month. My apartment is warm. I have new socks. I have hope.

All that to say rock bottom is real. But sometimes, just sometimes, if you pick up the phone, life answers back.",2,1751443845.0,stories,1,1.0,False

1lppyst,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lppyst,NRT *G Lounges,"Had a long layover so of course I went lounge hopping in NRT. Despite losing quite some time navigating the narrow aisles of Matsumoto Kiyoshi, I managed to check out ANA, UA, and the recently opened Turkish Airline Lounge in Satellite 4 in my 5-hour layover.

# Turkish Airline

Among the \*G choices in NRT, TK was my first choice to head to fresh off my flight from SFO simply for their shower facility. I had read previously that the UA ones were always out of order, while ANA often had a long queue. At TK, all three shower rooms in the facility were free when I arrived. The showers were equipped with all the basics---towels, hair dryer, slippers, and \*the\* hallmark of an advanced civilization---a *wooden* shoehorn. I would have liked to see facial care products like the Sekkisei that ANA lounges offer, but I packed mine so it wasn't a deal breaker.

At 3pm the lounge was nice and quiet. Seating options were mostly low sofas rather than working desks, but I was too sleep-deprived to work anyway.

One never goes hungry at any TYO airport even without lounge access, but TK managed to deliver a menu that differentiated the lounge from the usual Japanese fares offered by other lounges and restaurants. I love Turkish food and so enjoyed the lahmacun, pide, and Turkish delight. The chef at the lahmacun counter even made the effort to introduce the food. There was also a soba noodle counter that you could order from. Drink options were similar to all the other \*G lounges that I visited later. (It didn't occur to me to compare the self-served booze corners in these lounges). You can try out Turkish tea and coffee though if that's your thing---this is another detail that made this lounge quite unique.

Bathroom: 4/5 + 0.5 for the shoehorn in the shower room.

Food & Drinks: 5/5

Seating: 3/5

# UA

UA lounge was rather busy, so it took me some time to find a nice corner to settle despite the space being larger than TK's. The food set up was rather sad looking but again we're here to eat. Having padded my stomach with food from TK lounge, I proceeded to raid the dessert station, where there was a soft-serve machine and a spread of small bites. The soft serve was amazing, though I wish we could have some fun toppings. The warabi mochis were great. But most of all, I loved the curry rice at UA, so much that I thought UA should start selling pre-packaged Club Curry as a souvenir. I also preferred their fukujinzuke topping for the curry rice to the one in ANA. But then I remembered that you can't bring meat products back into the US if that's where you're headed... :(

Bathroom: 2/5 no bidet in the women's toilet. That's worse than the toilets outside of the lounge.

Food & Drinks: 4/5 I didn't care for the other options on display, but the soft serve truly saved the day.

# Seating: 3/5 not too bad if you can find somewhere to sit.

# ANA

Despite all reviews suggesting that the ANA lounge was the best choice in NRT for us peasants with no ANA Suite Lounge access, I found it rather mid. Like UA, it was also very crowded. Sure, the noodle bar is nice but it was not better than a generic noodle restaurant at the airport food court. You can probably get better sushi at Kyotatsu a few minutes down the concourse from this lounge. The steamed shumai pot was also ok at best. 

Also, similar to reviews I've read, the WiFi was very spotty.

Bathroom: 4/5 standard Japanese experience. Didn't try the shower since I already showered at TK.

Food & Drinks: 3/5

Seating: 4/5 same as UA but I liked the hollowed table design so you can stash your carryon out of people's way.

Tl;dr: Given another opportunity to transit through Japan, I'd definitely try to pick NRT and park myself at the Turkish lounge. I have to admit that the shopping experience at HND is usually nicer.

I (F26) have been in a somewhat situationship/relationship for almost a year on a long-distance, yes never met. Before you come at me, we are both from Muslim families, although living abroad we both still adhere to traditions. We live in different countries, we both have demanding jobs and we planned to meet later this year. For context, it was just perfect. This person (M28) healed absolutely everything that he never broke in the first place. He is just most kindest soul I met, at least to me. No matter where is he, what time it is, he would never ever let me come back home alone at least without texting me or calling me to make sure I am okay. He was obsessed with me, in a good way, as I am obsessed with him. We made plans to marry and he started learning my language to be able to impress my parents somewhere in the future. I did the same, and we were helping each other. We would argue VERY rarely, and had a promise to never disappear/ignore, as it is so easy to do over texting, but we never did that to each other.

So, we are both jealous people. And as from religious families, we both have expectations from our partner. So a week ago a guy I know, who studied my master's program after me, messaged me that he wants to talk about the immigration stuff, and for me to give him tips etc. and that we can do it over a coffee. Now, I messaged my guy to ask if it would be okay for me to go. His reaction was really bad, as in ""why do you need to satisfy him"" and ""he definitely wants more than that"". I defended myself, said it is not the first time someone from my program approaches me for help, but all he understood from my explanations was that I want to go on a date with this guy.

We fought for a while, he said he thought I knew him, but I don't and that it hurts him a lot. Then he stopped replying to me. At all. The day passed, I texted him a few times, then I texted on another app, again, nothing. Next morning he answers only to the second messages, saying that he turned off all notifications and doesn't want to talk to ANYONE, And then he says ""I don't want to argue at this stage of my life, I am disappointed and mad but I don't want to argue or tell you smth mean or viceversa."" And that's it. That's all he said in the past 5 days. I wrote him a long message after this, couldn't resist, saying that it was a shitty situation, and that I am sorry for hurting him, and that I still love him. He read and didn't reply.  
My heart literally hurts. It might seem stupid to you all, having never physically been with him, but I just wake up with tears, I cry when I talk to someone, I cry when I sleep. I have been talking to this person every single day and now he is gone over something like this. Person that would miss me when I was busy for an hour, and call me at night because he couldn't sleep without my voice. How could this happen because of this? I blame myself so much, like was it really so stupid of me to ask him. What do I do now? How can he just ignore me? Does it mean it is over? And how do I even freaking cope with this? All I do is sit, cry and listen to sad music.

**TL;DR:** Been in a long-distance situationship/relationship (never met) for almost a year with a wonderful guy (we're both Muslim, traditional). We planned to marry and were deeply committed — constant communication, emotional support, learning each other’s language, etc. A week ago, I asked him if it’s okay to grab coffee with a guy from my master’s program who asked for immigration advice. My guy got really upset, assumed the worst, and accused me of wanting to go on a date. After arguing, he stopped replying. It’s been 5 days.

Feeling lost and done with love,"I separated from my wife 9 months ago. She was officially diagnosed and had traits consistent with both BPD and NPD, according to her psychological reports. We were together for 5 years before marriage.

Since the breakup, it has been a painful and confusing ride. She first said she would give me a divorce, but after that came repeated cycles of love bombing, splitting, and emotional push-pull. Now she won’t even respond to my repeated, calm requests for legal closure. Just silence.

I have moved to another country and am trying to rebuild my life from afar. But emotionally, I still feel entangled. I shift between grief, anger, guilt, and exhaustion.

What truly broke me were two things:

1. Her disturbing accusation that I had an incestuous relationship with my own younger sister.


2. Learning that she told her ex-boyfriend she only married me for my looks, money, and the chance to go abroad.



As if that wasn't enough, she also cooked up stories and smeared my name to our shared friends and even my own family. I kept giving her the benefit of the doubt, but I had to wake up and smell the coffee when a close friend played a recording of a call with her. That moment shattered any illusion I had left.

Even writing this feels surreal. I gave her so much love, loyalty, and support. What I got back felt conditional, chaotic, and cruel.

Right now, the idea of another relationship feels impossible. My trust is broken. I gave my all, and I came out deeply wounded.

I was hired a year ago at a local hobby shop as a sales associate, . Eventually I was made aware by my coworkers that the boss (owner) and his wife are part of a local religious group called the Kabalarian Society. It was sometime probably 6-7 month into the job that I was offered well on the job by his wife to attend courses at the local hall on the philosophy and that they would pay for me and my girlfriend to attend. It was very awkward and I did not really say anything, she went and offered this to another coworker as well that day. 

About a month later my boss invited me to the coffee shop next door to the hobby shop to have a chat.  I assumed this would be about my hours/or work. When I sat down he explained how his job as the boss is to manage the store and to have good employees and ones that are healthy, for context I had missed a few days of work the previous week due to a stomach bug. He then slid over a couple cards about the kabalarian philosophy as well as a book on the philosophy for me to take. Now for context the kabalarian philosophy believes that your name influences your life and health so he was essentially suggesting a switch my name. After about ten minutes of him explaining different things all regarding the philosophy and the different cycles we take in our life’s i was able to get up and take the cards and leave. That was the last incident I had directly with him however I regularly heard him have similar conversations with my coworkers and customers. 

My question is if this is allowed ? I have another issue where I was deducted roughly $310 for faulty work and I’m in the process of making a complaint about that but I want to know if there is some sort of complaint I could file about this as well. ",2,1751441692.0,legaladvicecanada,1,0.75,False

1lpppke,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1lpppke/customer_spat_at_me_today/,Customer spat at me today,"I work at a Cafe and today was absolutely fucked. Extremely busy, understaffed, technology breaking, rude customers - already dogshit day. 

I was over it by just about the second I walked in there honestly

That all got a thousand times worse though when this lady comes up to us though. I didn't hear the conversation with my coworker at the register as I was racing back and forth putting sandwiches on to toast and getting slices for people. 

I'm rushing to the front  cake display when I suddenly get a bunch of coffee cups hit into me as said lady angrily storms off passed the front bench and I feel a spray of *something* hit my arm while im looking at all the coffee cups I now have to fucking pick up and restock asap because this mega bitch decided to of course pull this shit in the middle of a fucking rush. 

I just assume it's coffee until a customer tells me that she has spat on the display as well. So that was just fucking excellent. 

It's WORSE though and I can't stop seething on her behalf, my coworker who served her got spat at too and it hit her in the *face*. Like what kind of fucking animal do you have to be to spit at some poor person just trying to do their job in the fucking face? 

I later heard from my coworker (I'll say M bc this is gonna get confusing) that what happened is this lady came up demanding that she was owed a free coffee, and that she was served by another coworker (A) last night. M calls over A to confirm this, A says no she didn't, so M refuses (NICELY, might I add. Like M is genuinely the most customer service ready friendly mf I've ever seen) just cops being spat at. 

Even worse, my coworker M is severely immuno-compromised. Like if she gets sick, she could potentially *die* type shit. This happened in peak sick season in a hospital Cafe too for context. 

I'm really pissed off as well, because one manager made out as if she would call the police to deal with this shit but backed out, and the other head manager in charge of us instead came down and essentially blamed A for serving her in the first place, telling her that if this customer comes back to just give her what she wants so it doesn't happen again?? 

Like how about don't fucking ENABLE this shit and protect your workers from fuckers who want to ACTUALLY ASSAULT THEM???

Genuinely the police should have been fucking called. Especially because I heard that this lady had come and pulled her shit at another one of the shops (actually the manager who initially came down) and literally *threatened to kill her* for not giving her her food. 

LIKE WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU M E A N WE ARE GOING TO JUST LET THIS SHIT GO ON AND NOT CALL THE COPS?? Bitch has already spat on someone, what's it going to take next before the cops are fucking called to deal with this cunt? Fucking battery? Like what the hell bruh ",1,1751441596.0,Vent,1,0.99,False

The morning light finds him still— curled beneath sheets that know the journey of his sleep, each wrinkle a road he's traveled in dreams.

His boots wait by the door, patient as headstones, laces loose and ready to tie him to distances I will never walk.

But not yet.

Let him breathe the air of this room that holds his voice mid-crack at thirteen, the weight of secrets whispered to ceiling fans, the ghost-sound of controllers thrown in defeat.

These walls have kept vigil— watching him outgrow the boy who needed stories read twice, who hid under blankets from thunderstorms that seem small now beside the weather coming.

Soon he will learn the color of distant wars, fold himself into uniforms that will teach his body new shapes of standing. Soon strangers will call him by his last name only, never knowing he still talks in his sleep sometimes, still kicks off covers like he's running toward something or away.

Later, lecture halls will swallow him— another face in rows of faces, none of them knowing he used to save Christmas money for months just to buy me something I'd never use but kept anyway.

But this morning—

let the sun crawl. Let the coffee grow cold. Let his phone stay silent on the nightstand, its black screen reflecting nothing but the ceiling he's stared at through every fever, every heartbreak, every night he couldn't sleep because the future felt too large.

I want to memorize the rise and fall of his breathing, the way his hand dangles off the mattress like he's reaching for something just out of reach.

Maybe it's me. Maybe it's home. Maybe it's the boy he's already half-forgotten how to be.

Soon I will learn new ways of missing. I will catch myself setting his place at dinner, buying his favorite cereal, listening for the specific clicking of his key in the lock.

But right now he is still mine to worry over, still small enough that sleep can hold him, still close enough that I can hear his dreams from down the hall.

At least until

he opens his eyes.

1lpplp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aktienanalyse/comments/1lpplp0/luckin_coffee_zu_viel_hype/,Luckin Coffee - zu viel Hype?,"Alleine dieses Jahr hat die Aktie rund 50% zugelegt, kommt mittlerweile auf 12 Mrd. $ Börsenwert und damit fast auf das ehemalige Rekordhoch. 

Hype-Frage 1: Gibt’s passend zum Kursanstieg auch Wachstum im Business? Ja!

* Letztes Quartal hat Luckin 1.757 neue Läden eröffnet. Das sind 20 Läden am Tag. Fairerweise hat Luckin insgesamt schon 24.000 Läden. Relativ gesehen ist das Wachstum also nicht ganz so krass, aber immer noch stark. Spannend ist, dass Luckin viele dieser Stores selbst betreibt – nämlich circa zwei Drittel. Das schnelle Wachstum kommt also nicht daher, dass man einfach random Franchise-Lizenzen vergibt.

Hype-Frage 2: Ist das Wachstum nachhaltig? Naja!

* Mit Neueröffnungen zu wachsen, ist erstens relativ einfach und frisst zweitens Geld. Viel attraktiver ist, wenn in bestehenden Läden mehr Umsatz gemacht wird. Das sah im ersten Quartal ganz gut aus – da gab’s fast 10% Wachstum - letztes Jahr ist der Umsatz in bestehenden Läden aber fast 20% eingebrochen. Der Grund: Luckin hat massiv expandiert und mit aggressiven Rabatt-Aktionen Kunden in die Läden geholt. Den Umsatz hat das aber nach unten gedrückt. Das sieht jetzt wieder besser aus. Starke Konkurrenz wie Cotti oder Starbucks könnte Luckin aber in neue Rabattschlachten reinziehen.

Hype-Frage 3: Ist die Bewertung noch halbwegs fair? Naja!

* Verglichen mit dem Wachstum ist Luckin auf den ersten Blick nicht extrem teuer. Letztes Jahr gab’s um die 400 Mio. $ Gewinn – die Bewertung entspricht dem 30-fachen davon. Wenn man sich aber anschaut, wie andere chinesische Tech-Aktien bewertet werden, die teilweise ein attraktiveres Business mit weniger Konkurrenz haben, ist das schon eher am oberen Ende des Hype-Radars. Dazu hat die Firma am Montag ihren ersten Laden in New York eröffnet - das bringt Wachstumspotenzial, vor allem aber Expansionsrisiko.

# Chapter 1 Bailey

I looked at the clock on my bedroom wall. I think I have delayed the inevitable for as long as I physically can. I should go to the packhouse to go and wish our pack's upcoming Alpha a happy birthday. The bane of my life. My brother’s best friend. One day to be Alpha Miles. Today he will turn 17, and meet his Alpha wolf. In all honesty, he was egotistical enough, thinking the world revolved around him, without him adding to that by finally gaining his wolf. Not your run-of-the-mill werewolf either. Oh no, Miles Davenport was destined to be an Alpha, so he would have a strong and powerful Alpha wolf, only adding to his arrogance and strength.

The crazy thing is, Miles had once upon a time been one of my closet friends too. In my younger childhood... Friends, that kind of thing comes when your father is the Beta to the Alpha. The children spend a lot of time together, and become friends. My older brother, Jordan, became the wing-man to Miles. His closest friend and ally, who as his Beta when the time came, was only right. But as the years went on, the friendship between Miles and I changed.

Friendship faded as he grew into a more popular sports star of our school. At the end of the day, he was always going to be popular, he was the upcoming Alpha after all, but as one of the top sports stars too, he was idolized. As was my brother. All the girls in school flocked around them like they were pop stars or something, and it was bizarre. I was nothing more to him now but a source of amusement for him and his sports buddies. A geek. Not one of the beauty queens who followed him around. Simply someone to make fun of.

I had gone from enjoying time with my one-day Alpha, to hating him, in the space of a school year. He thought he was god’s gift, and in all honesty, if he was, he is a gift I would return…

“Bailey!” I heard my Mum call from downstairs, telling me I was definitely running it close now for time. I know Jordan had already headed over to the packhouse a while ago with my Dad to meet his friend and our Alpha.

“I know.” I yelled back, looking at the books on my desk, desperate to continue with the assignment I was working on. I would so much rather continue working on the assignment and gain the additional credit available, work toward going to the college I want to go to instead of going to a party for the big-headed bully, I got to consider almost family, considering he was the son of my Dad’s best friend.

I stood from my seat, and walked to my mirror, adjusting my black skater dress I had chosen to wear today. Something plain and simple, easy to blend into the background, but a dress all the same if anyone asked why I hadn’t made an effort. Along with my chunky black sandals, I looked presentable, not that anyone would be looking at me. Today, all eyes would be on the birthday boy, as they always were. He would make sure of that. I flicked back my curly brown hair, before I walked out of the door, already dreading the hours that lay ahead…

My Mum pulled the car into the parking spaces outside the packhouse, while my younger sister Morgan was flicking at the curls around my head, simply trying to irritate me. She knew I would rather be anywhere but here right now, and was loving every last moment of it. “Aww, you want to go home Bailey-boo?” she teased.

“Stop you two, come on, your Dad is waiting inside. Let us go and find the birthday boy.” Mum says, sounding cheerful, completely oblivious to the fact how horrendous this party had the potential to be. She, too, worshiped Miles. Having seen him grow up alongside my brother, she seemed to think the sun shone out of his rear-end. It had always driven me insane.

“He won’t even notice us there.” I muttered under my breath as I followed her up the steps of the back house, shaking my head at my sister and how overdressed she looked. She definitely looked like she was out to impress someone today. A small part of me wondered if she hoped she might be the fated mate of Miles. After all, he was meeting his Alpha wolf today. He will have shifted for the first time today, and today could potentially be the day he can sense his fated mate out there waiting for him! There had been so much buzz around school about this, so many of the girls were excited about the potential possibility they could be his fated mate. The one chosen for him by the moon goddess. The one destined to be with him. So many of them are desperate for it to be them. While there I was desperate for anything but. I could think of nothing worse! Yet, looking at the amount of effort my younger sister had made today, I am beginning to think she was one of the many she-wolves that was holding out that hope…

We walked through the corridors of the packhouse, and it was filled with various pack members. Today was a day of celebration within pack, the birthday of the upcoming Alpha. And not just any birthday, the day he came of age. The day he met his Alpha wolf. The walls of the packhouse were adorned with decorations, music was blaring from various speakers dotted around the multiple rooms.

“Ooff, sorry!” a giggling she-wolf said to me as she nearly knocked me off my feet as she knocked into me. I would rather be anywhere but here right now. This was far too hectic and far too loud for me. I simply glare at the back of the girl as she moves away from me, not a care in the world.

I followed my Mum and my sister, who was almost skipping as she walked, toward the main lounge area. I can only assume my Mum had mindlinked my Dad to let him know we had arrived, and he said they were there, or else we could spend all day looking around for them! It appeared almost every member of the pack had turned up to celebrate the birthday of Miles fucking Davenport.

The lounge area was laden with people, music truly blasting, and everyone seeming to have a good time. Everyone but me. I caught the eye of my brother, leaning against the wall of the lounge, the furthest away from the door we had just walked into. He nodded in my direction before simply turning away.

‘Could have made an effort, Bailey.’ he mindlinked. ‘It is a birthday, not a funeral, you know?’

I felt my heart sink at his words. Great, the insults were starting already, which meant it would only be a matter of time until Miles started too. The two of them seemed to like working together like that. Finding great enjoyment in harassing me. I was only a year younger than both of them, and had desperately hoped the name-calling and insulting would ease off as they got a little older, but if anything, they seemed to get worse. All because I wasn’t like the girls they were interested in, I was sure of it. I wasn’t like the other girls. Made myself an easy target, my Mum told me, all because I enjoyed studying. Liked reading and learning. Said, I only made it harder for myself. The plan was to make it easier for myself by finding a way out…

“Jordan says your dress looks like you are going to a funeral, Bailey.” Morgan teased, fluffing up my curls again. My long brown hair fell in thick, unruly curls down my back. They drove me mad at times. Especially when my brother and sister decide to mess with them.

“Oh well, I wore a dress, like you asked.” I snapped, moving away from them, feeling angry already, so tempted just to turn around and walk home, only to be pulled back by my Mum.

“We are going to wish Miles a happy birthday. You will stay for a while at least. I do not need to be explaining to your Aunt and Uncle yet again why you have walked out on a social event, Bailey.” Mum warned me, her tone sounding grumpy, I swear she had to have read my thoughts on leaving the party already. I am sure she hated having me as a daughter, likely wishing for one that was more sociable, and one that enjoyed being a part of everything, instead of one that would rather have her head in a book.

“Awww, Happy Birthday, Miles!” I heard my sister squeal from by my side. I swear she spoke at a pitch so high only dogs could hear. Goddess knows why she is so excited. It is only his birthday. He likely doesn’t even care, he never normally does…

As I looked up, his blue eyes were locked on me, I raised my gaze to meet his, and could see his eyes shift to a darker blue… was that his wolf? I see a snarl across his face as he suddenly storms from the room. What the hell was that about?

‘Get out here.’ Miles is suddenly mindlinking me, and I have to say he sounded far from impressed. That, combined with the angry expression on his face, told me something was off. Would he have rather I had not come? Well, he was not the only one…

‘What?’ I questioned, completely confused. Was he annoyed over how I had dressed too? Jeez, it was just a dress. Does it really matter? I would go home if it was.

‘Outside now.’ He demanded once more, sounding even more irritated this time, making me realize I had little choice but to follow his orders, so I snuck away from the ongoing party back to the doors of the packhouse.

Only to find Miles pacing along the bottom of the steps, looking a mixture of confused and angry. So why did he need me here? Someone to take his anger out on? I was not willing to be that, I was sure about that… Just as I was about to walk away, he looked up.

“Fucking took you long enough.” He snapped.

I frowned, unsure what this was all about, but it was making no sense to me as I looked down toward him from where I stood at the top of the packhouse steps. His blue eyes shifted to the dark blue once more, like they had inside, taking me by surprise. His wolf is clearly lingering…

“What is wrong, Miles? Do you want me to get Jordan?” I asked.

“No I do not! I do not want anyone knowing this.” He snarls, a growl slipping from his lips, though whether that was aimed at me or whether his wolf was angry at him, I do not know…

“I don’t think I understand…” I began.

“You soon will.” He sneers, and I simply look to him in confusion. Nothing he says makes sense to me. Until he continues. “Only today did I realize. The thought makes me sick. Why our own moon goddess would play a trick like this on me, I don’t know. I am an Alpha. A fucking Alpha. I deserve a strong mate. A beautiful mate to be proud of. Not some feeble pathetic wallflower.”

My body trembles at his words. No. I had yet to gain my wolf. I did not know this yet. Why… Why him of all people? “I am your fated mate?” I question with a shaky voice. “Are you sure?”

“Are you fucking doubting me?” he yells. “And you won’t be. The moment you have your wolf, I will decide when the time is right to reject you.”

My heart twists and contorts at the thought. Rejection was meant to be the most painful thing possible. Why would he want to reject the mate chosen for him by our own moon goddess? Am I truly so repulsive?

# Chapter 2 Bailey

A Year Later

Yet another birthday party for our beloved upcoming Alpha. Ha. Not my beloved upcoming Alpha. I hated the fucker. Breaking my heart without a second thought. What I had done to deserve that I had never got a proper explanation from him. Other than the frequent insults, of why would he want to be with someone like me? Did I look like Luna material to him? I had no clue. What the hell did Luna material look like in his eyes? Some blond bimbo, no doubt. They were the she-wolves he tended to spend his time with within our pack. The ones who worshiped the ground he walked on. That would do anything he asked of them. Ones that I highly doubted read much more than the work set of them at school.

“Bailey!” my Mum yelled at me from the stairway of our family home. “Will you hurry up?!”

“Do I really need to come to the party?” I responded. “I am telling you, Miles will not be bothered if I am not there!”

“Your Aunt and Uncle will be though. And I am not explaining to them again why you are missing.” My Mum continues yelling. “Do you not realize just how many events you have missed this year, all because you have your head in a book?”

“Yeah Bai-Bai. Such a geek. No wonder you have no friends.” My sister Morgan giggles from outside my bedroom door.

“Piss off.” I hissed. “I have friends.”

I stormed from my room, and down the stairs toward my waiting family. I planned to greet the birthday boy, not that he would care in the slightest. I know that he would rather not see me at all. And then I would sneak home.

“Ew, are you wearing that?” Morgan asked.

I looked down at the skinny black trousers I had on and the white tank top. Great. I can’t win. Nothing I wear is approved of by my sister, evidently named the fashion queen without my knowledge. Oh well, I am dressed and wearing it. I think it looked good with my chunky black sandals I had on…

I scowled at my sister and walked out of the door. “Are we going or not?” I snapped at them all, truly not able to wait for the following month when I leave to go to university. Get away from them, and this pack!

The party was well underway when we arrived, music pounding from the speakers as couples made out in every available space, so I averted my eyes as we walked through the corridors of the packhouse to the lounge where we would no doubt find Miles reigning over his people. Being all important, like he was partial to considering himself.

‘Why are you here?’ Miles’s voice filled my mindlink, before I had even fully entered the room behind my parents.

Great. ‘I didn’t get a choice. Trust me, I would rather not be.’ I snapped back.

I was getting more than a little tired of the way he would treat me. Yes, he planned on rejecting me. Decided I was not for him, but he could have left it at that. I didn’t need treating like I was some sort of social pariah because of the fact he decided I was not right for him. I do not think I deserved that. I had endured enough bullying through my time in high school, for the fact I enjoyed my education.

‘Oh. Excuse me? Are you implying you were not going to come to the party of your next Alpha?’ Miles links with some serious attitude.

‘Miles, you just asked why I had bothered coming. Now you are asking if I was not going to come? Make your mind up.’ I argued.

‘Remember who I am Bailey. You are not above me. Never will be. Could have been equal to me at most had I seen you as suitable to be my mate, but no. You were beneath that honor.’ He sneers.

I felt anger racing through me. ‘And you think I would not have rejected you?’ I snapped, moving back toward the exit, not wanting to be here anymore. Until I felt a hand grabbing the back of my tank top, yanking me back.

My eyes darted upward to see the dark eyes of Miles. Sneering down at me. Our Pack’s upcoming Alpha. The most arrogant man I think I have ever met. One, thankfully, I did not have to be mates with any longer as the stupid fucker had chosen to reject his own fated mate before even giving her a chance. “Going somewhere Bailey?” he asked, his voice full of spite.

“Well, I do believe you asked me why I was here, so I assumed you wanted me to leave.” I told him.

Miles bows his head down so it is level with mine, he inhales deeply, like he still enjoys the scent of me. He has done this numerous times of late, which I find quite bizarre. But, I ignore him as he tilts his head to look at me, “Hmm, I think my Mum and Dad may have something to say if you leave. Their clever little Bailey. Heaven forbid.” He presses his forehead against mine. “Just stay away from me, and do not spoil my fun.”

I shake my head in disbelief at him, as he stalks away. Did he even think for a moment I would be going near him if I could avoid it? I would rather be anywhere but near him!

“Bailey, why are you harassing my friend for?” I heard my brother, Jordan demand, as he suddenly approached, causing many people to turn around and look at me. Wonderful. Nothing like starting pack gossip is there. I am sure Miles would appreciate that!

“I wasn’t harassing him, he came to speak to me. Asking why I had come.” I told him, and my brother laughed. He is as much an idiot as Miles. Any of my friends who have big brothers hate how protective they are. Me? No, my big brother is the one leading all the bullying and being a total dick to me. He finds great embarrassment in the fact his younger sister is far from being one of the popular group, and is, in his words, ‘far too into her books’. I think, in all honesty, my entire family found me, in one way or another, a huge embarrassment.

“Well, he has a point. Not like you will be joining in with the celebrations. You will probably be sitting in a quiet corner somewhere reading.” He teases.

“Well, it is certainly more intellectually pleasing than any of you would be.” I smirked at him as I walked away from my brother who was standing looking confused. I am sure he had no clue what I meant. The scary thing is he will be the next, pack Beta. Heaven help our pack. Between him and Miles they only had one brain cell between them, and that was one that they shared, I am sure of it! And even then, I think it was rechargeable and started losing power and knowledge at a rapid rate! They only graduated high school because they paid people to do their work for them.

As I snuck away, out of the busy lounge to the top of the stairway, where I hoped to hide out for as long as possible, I heard footsteps behind me. I quickly turned, hoping it was simply someone on their way to their bedroom or even to one of the spare bathrooms on this floor. But, sadly, luck was not on my side tonight. No. Miles was following me. Eyebrows raised and looking quite irritated.

“Oi. I want to talk to you.” he demanded.

“You asked me to go away a minute ago, didn’t you?” I asked him.

“Don’t think so, think it was more a case of why you were here.” Miles says with a smirk. Sitting on the top step with me.

“Miles, you have the whole pack here for your birthday, I am sure whatever you need to speak to me about can wait.” I shrugged, desperately craving peace, which, considering the pounding beat of the music playing, would be difficult.

“No. Why didn’t you tell me you were leaving?” he questions, like he is irate at the fact I had not let him know. Why would I let him know?

“Why would I? We aren’t friends, Miles. You also are not my Alpha yet. It was arranged with my parents, me and your Dad, as Alpha.” I explained to him, unsure why this would even bother him. If anything, I would think he would be glad to get rid of me.

“You are going away though.” he murmurs.

“That is generally what happens when you go to college or university. Yeah.” I said with another shrug.

“There wasn’t one closer to home?” he hisses. “Because it seems to me you picked the one furthest away.”

“What does it matter to you? You hate me. I won't be here, You get your wish of being rid of me.” I snapped, truly sick of him trying to dictate to me what I should and shouldn’t be doing. I had worked hard in school, so I could do this. My parents had spoken to my Aunt and Uncle, the Luna and Alpha of our pack to allow me special permission to go to a university out of state to study, saying it was what I had dreamed of. I had nothing holding me back. And, with the fact Miles did not want me for his mate, or his Luna, I truly did not. Not that any of them knew of that. That was our own secret.

Even despite the pull to him as my mate since my wolf had arrived, I still found him truly repulsive. He sickened me. Though, the pains when he slept with the many she-wolves that visited his bed, made it even easier to detest the man that he had become. I still had no clue what I had done to deserve this treatment from this man, other than not being one of the popular group. But, I knew I deserved better than him.

Miles glanced at me, momentarily a thoughtful look passed over his face, almost caring, before a hardness replaced it. “That much is true. No more having to see the disappointing failure the moon goddess made of mating me to you. At least not for a few years. Who knows, perhaps you will meet someone while there. I suggest you do. That way you won’t have to come back, because, I, as Alpha, will be looking for my Luna.”

“Miles, I honestly do not care if you find someone else.” I told him, going to stand and head home, not wishing to spend another moment in the same place as him.

As I went to move away, he grabbed my hand, pulling me to him, so I was once more sitting level with him on the top step of the first floor landing of our packhouse. “Always so righteous aren’t you Bailey? You say you don’t care? We will see. Well, this will be on my terms. I, Miles Davenport, reject you, Bailey West, as my fated mate…” he began, and my head began to whirl as his words sunk in. The realization and excruciating pain of what was happening becoming too much for me…

# Chapter 3 Bailey

Three Years Later

I drove the long road down to pack. I hated this drive. It was like returning to hell for me. Lotus Shadow Pack. My very own version of hell. Though, three years away, studying had been truly amazing. Transforming myself into the woman I should always have been. Confident. Self-assured. Brave. Just me. And now a fully qualified teacher.

As a she-wolf, you spend so many years of your life being told your focus is finding your fated mate. Settling down with them and creating a strong matebond. A love. A family. Well, once I had come to accept that my naïve, teenage dreams would never surface, thanks to the moon goddess pairing me with a mate so incapable of loving anyone other than himself, I decided that my focus would be my career. My education had always been something I took great pride in. I loved to learn, and I had decided that I wanted to pass that gift along. I no longer cared what others thought of me. And, while at university, it felt so wonderful to be surrounded by others who felt the same way. I finally felt like I fit in somewhere.

And, I believe that is what allowed me to become the person I was meant to be. However, now, I had to return to my pack, at their orders. The agreement was, once I had completed my degree, I would return home. Unless, of course, I had found my fated mate. But, I knew within my heart, that was never to happen. For, my fated mate sat at home. Lording it over our pack. Acting like he was the best thing since sliced bread. Sleeping with any she-wolf that came near him, from what I heard, having rejected me.

I pulled up at our guarded pack gates. Harley, one of our pack warriors, currently on guard duty, stepped forward to my car window. “ID” he ordered.

I frowned at him. I do not think I have been asked for ID before when returning home, even in all the times I have visited home, though in all fairness, those visits have been few and far between. My visits were only when they were required of me. I had grown to loathe this place, and coming back had become less of a priority for me over the time I was away...

“Harley, it is me. Bailey.” I explained, trying not to smile at his mistake.

Harley looked at me closer. “Shit. Sorry Bailey, didn’t really recognize you there. You changed your hair. And you aren’t wearing your glasses. You look good.” He says with a shrug, quickly looking away, clearly embarrassed by his faux-pas.

I smirk at his response. Yes, my hair is somewhat tamer than it used to be. The curls straightened out, and my hair now neat and sleek down my back. My glasses I had worn for reading had been long gone. Having got my eyes fixed with laser eye surgery whilst away. Plus, I now wore a little simple make-up to accentuate my features. Nice to know somebody has noticed a difference…

“No problem. You still need ID?” I asked him.

He grins at me. “I think I know who you are. Nice to see you.” he nods at me in acknowledgment as the gate opens for me. “Maybe catch you around while you are back.” He adds as I begin to drive away.

I smiled in response, I guess there would be nothing to stop me catching up with any guy I wanted to now. Not that I was really bothered right now... but it was not like I had a fated mate to wait for any longer. And it wasn’t like Miles was making a point of staying single. Every time I had returned home, he had had a different she-wolf on his arm. Parading them through pack like a prized possession, only to have traded her in by the time I returned on my next visit. He was turning into quite the lothario. And quite a joke in my eyes.

I set off along the quiet, familiar roads of our sweet old pack. The evening sun was settling in the sky as I moved my car down the route to my family home. No doubt my Mum would be there waiting for me, perhaps my Dad, if he was in from work by now. My brother and sister, I was unsure. They still both lived at home with my parents, but were back and forth to friends' homes and my brother was looking to move into the Beta suite in the packhouse soon enough, in preparation for taking on the role from my father when the time came. Either way, they rarely bothered to rush home to see me when they knew I was returning. I don’t think seeing me was at the top of their priority list…

I pulled my car up on the street in front of my familiar family home. I could not believe I was home. Stuck back here. The dread within my stomach churned heavily at the prospect of many years stuck here. Miserable and unhappy, with no way out, now my fated mate had rejected me. Not that anyone other than Miles and I knew of that. No. He had decided he would be considered weak if others knew an Alpha had gone against the powerful Moon Goddess’s choice. So, this was our secret. Or he would make me pay in ways I did not want to imagine, apparently.

And, in all honesty, I did not want to think of it. He had allowed me to go away to do my degree. Doing the final bit of convincing when my Uncle, the current Alpha, and Miles’s father, along with my parents were on the fence. Or, so he said. How true that was, I would never likely know the truth, but it had been for that reason, and that alone I had chosen to do as he had asked.

If he had done the things he said, then he had allowed me to fulfill my dream of gaining my degree of teaching away from pack. To allow me to be just me, not the daughter of the pack Beta. And I have thrived because of it. But, now, I had to return. Back to where I belonged. And, while I may have gained my degree, I had no real future prospects. I was likely stuck here.

I stepped from the car, determined more than ever to find work, as I heard my Mum’s voice. “Bailey!” she greeted me from the porch steps, a big smile upon her face. “You look beautiful sweetheart.”

I smiled back at her, as I moved toward the front door. Only to see Miles leaving the house next door to ours. The Alpha home. Could I have timed my arrival home any worse?

His eyes met mine, giving me a dark stare before looking at my Mum. “Hi Aunt Brianna. You didn’t say she was home today.”

Mum smiled at Miles like she thought the world of him, though most of the time she generally did. “Ah, I think it slipped my mind. Bailey is home for good now, Miles. How wonderful is that?”

Once more, Miles gave me a dark stare. “Hmmm. Truly wonderful.” he said with some serious contempt in his voice.

‘You stay out of my way unless I say otherwise, you understand?’ Miles mindlinks me, as he moves toward his car.

“Are you not going to speak to him Bai?” Mum tries. “He will be Alpha this time next year, you know?”

“Oh it doesn’t matter, Aunt Brianna. Bailey will be excused this time. I am sure she is tired from her drive back home. But no doubt I will be seeing her around. And yes, she will have to get used to me as her senior. Her Alpha.” He says with a sneer, and at his words my stomach twists into knots. I don’t think I can stay here… I not only need to find work, I need to find work away from my pack, so I can move away to get away from my psychotic Alpha and ex-mate!

# Chapter 4 Bailey

I sit out in the garden drinking my morning coffee, with my laptop open scrolling desperately through the job vacancies, when I hear a deep growl to my left, causing me to swirl my head to look. Miles was resting his head on the garden fence from next door, overlooking our back garden, to where I was sitting. Watching me intently, the look upon his face was one of sheer disgust...

I had no clue how long he had been standing there, or what had angered him to the point of growling, but he had made me jump. “Fucking hell, Miles.” I snapped, giving him a dark scowl. I had done well the past week since arriving and stayed out of his way. Managing to ensure I avoided all pack events, and ensuring I dodged any places he was likely to be. Yes, it meant I spent an awful lot of time in my bedroom at home, but I would rather do that than have to deal with him.

Today, the sun was glorious, and I thought it would be nice to take my breakfast outside while I looked for jobs online. Sitting on the patio furniture we have in the back garden, under the warmth of the morning sunshine, my coffee was enjoyable, all until this stupid fucker disturbed me. I shook my head in his direction, wondering why he had snuck up on me. He had so many more places he could be...

“Who do you think you are cursing at?” Miles snarled.

“The creep who did exactly that. Crept up on me out of the blue for no good reason.” I rolled my eyes at him in disgust, only to see this seemed to anger him further. Though, I think anything I did would anger Miles. He seemed to hold some serious resentment towards me at the moment, but should I really expect anything less?

“I will come over there and deal with you, Bailey.” He hissed.

“Deal with me?” I questioned his choice of words. “Deal with me how? You asked me to stay out of your way. That is what I am doing.”

“What are you doing?” he chose to ignore my words, and looks to my laptop screen instead, so I slowly shut the screen down, so he would be unable to see. I do not want him knowing I am applying for work outside the area. I would not put it past him to stop it from happening. He seems to be being deliberately nasty of late, so I truly do not know what he would sink to, in order to be nasty towards me…

“Nothing of your concern.”

“I am your Alpha. So, all that goes on in my pack is my business.” He tells me with a smirk.

I shook my head with a smirk back, “Hmm, not quite Miles, you are not. Your Dad is still Alpha, so don’t be getting ahead of yourself.”

An angry look flared across his face once more. His handsome features contorted in fury. He did not like having people disagree with him. But I was not about to have him dictating to me...

“Just because you were my mate once upon a time does not give you the right to talk to me however you please, you know.” Miles snarls.

“She is your mate?” a voice questions, causing us both to whip our heads round, only to see the unexpected face of Miles’s younger brother Ellis.

I look at Miles with despair now, my heart pounding within my chest and my palms becoming sweaty. Wondering what the hell he planned to do now the secret we had kept between us for so long was out now… how had neither of us heard him coming?

“No she is not. She rejected me.” Miles said coldly, looking at me as if daring me to disagree with him.

Wait... he was making it out like I had rejected him? I looked at Miles in shock, but the look within his eyes was like he dared me to argue.

“You rejected your Alpha? What kind of fool are you?” Ellis asked as his eyes looked me up and down like a piece of dirt. Sadly, a look I am more than used to. “Do Mum and Dad know?”

Miles shakes his head. “No. I don’t want them to either. It would worry them too much, Els, please do not say anything. Bailey and I were never a good match, so perhaps she made the right choice. Please for me?” Miles is pleading with his brother, and part of me wonders if he is worried what his family would do if they learned of his decision to go against the Moon Goddess. As an Alpha, this was almost unheard of. Blaming me was gutless. But, if that is what he wants to do, then let him.

‘Do not even think of saying anything different.’ Miles’s voice reverberates through my mind via the link. ‘Or you will learn to regret it. That degree you love so much could easily be destroyed.’

I took in the words Miles had said, and the sad thing is, I do not doubt them. I would not put it past him finding a way to have my degree removed. Having me stuck within our pack. He would be Alpha soon enough, and he would be the one able to dictate what I did... I had little choice but to do as he asked. Yet i felt anger racing through my veins...

I lifted my laptop and stood from my seat. “I will talk to you however I like Miles. When you seem to think you can treat me however you like.” and with that I walked away from the two brothers, both looking at me, walking away in shock. I know I would come to regret what I had just said, but I truly no longer cared…",1,1751441144.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

1lppkc1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lppkc1,Standout Coffee - Non-existent customer service,"Anyone had experience with Standout Coffee and their customer service? Recently I contacted them and was ghosted for over 10 days. With no explanation aside from them saying it “looks right”.

Last year I subscribed to their 2 bottle/4week sub for about 4 months and it was fantastic. Everything was charged in EUR and my bank handled the exchange, no issues. 

I stopped for awhile since I was traveling and recently in April they revamped their back end system and updated their pricing (according to their customer service then). They also had a 50% off first month subscription, however I noticed prices are now charged in local currency. MYR for me. 

This was all fine with me until the recurring payment. 

The cost of a 4 bottle sub from Standout is EUR 47.16 per cycle. 

April - MYR 122 (50% off, full price MYR 244, this is about EUR 48 which is their advertised price for a 4 bottle sub) 

June - MYR 298 (this is over 25% more than what they put on their website, EUR 47.16, today’s rates puts it at MYR 233 ish)

This is nearly 25% more than what I was initially charged and signed up for. I sent 2 email and follow ups from over 10 days ago, no reply. 

I reached out to customer service via their website, I was told “it seems equivalent” with no clarification they didn't even try to understand where the price difference is coming from. I asked further questions and was ghosted.

While I am happy with their quality and pricing, charging 25% more than what they said they would could have been a mistake, but ghosting their customer is just scummy.

The same thing happened to a friend I recommended who subscribed at the same time but in another currency. 

So if you have a subscription with standout, go check and make sure you recurring payments are correct. For me I’m cancelling for now and then deciding what to do. ",0,1751441009.0,pourover,1,0.33,False

1lppj3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogfree/comments/1lppj3r/dogs_the_drive_thru_a_rant/,dogs & the drive thru \\ a rant,"  I’m a barista at a local coffee joint, and I get at least 5 dogs coming through the drive-thru every shift. Every time I encounter one, I just feel awkward. I go through the works, ask if they want a pup cup, blah blah. But there’s this pressure, with the dog staring into my soul (and often the owner doing the same) to hype up the dog more than I really care to. I do think some dogs are kinda cute, usually bigger dogs who are actually well behaved, and I’ll give them a little smile if I see them- but I. Am. So. Tired! I’m so tired of pretending every dog I see is cute! I’ve even tried to just ignore the dogs a few times but I can always tell when a dog owner is upset that I didn’t comment on it. ESPECIALLY when they intentionally open the back window/have their dog sitting on their lap, basically sticking its head into the store. I can just feel them waiting for me to ask to pet it, or ask its name, and I genuinely could not be bothered to do either. Please get your dog out of my space!

  The same applies when a coworker is on window and calls everyone over to look at a “cute” (usually ugly rat) dog. I just have to walk over and awkwardly laugh, because I do not care!! I don’t want to stop what I’m doing to look at a dog that I’ve seen 500 carbon copies of throughout my lifetime.

  Anyways, mostly just a vent. Don’t even get me started on the people who bring their dogs INTO the store. Yuck.

The skipped meals. The late nights and endless caffeine. So when her skin started flaring—first a rash, then persistent redness—she chalked it up to burnout.

But the patches spread. Her cheeks burned, her forehead stung, and the area around her mouth felt like it was constantly on fire. She tried cutting out dairy. Switched to fragrance-free everything. Bought every “sensitive skin” product the internet recommended.

Nothing worked.

Worse, the stares started. In meetings. At cafes. Even friends asked, “Is it contagious?” Her confidence shattered. She started wearing high collars, her hair down, anything to hide her face. One day she overheard a co-worker whisper, “Maybe it’s something serious.”

She went to a doctor. Then another. Got misdiagnosed twice. Was told it was eczema. Then rosacea. Then “probably just hormones.” Every cream made it worse. Every appointment left her more confused.

She stopped hoping.

Until she booked one last consultation—with **Dr. Sonal Chavan**. She didn’t expect a miracle. But this time, someone actually *listened*. Asked the right questions. Didn’t rush. Took a deeper look.

The treatment plan wasn’t overnight magic. But it made sense. It *felt* right. Slowly, the burning eased. The redness softened. Her skin began to calm—and so did she.

Last week, she went out without makeup. Ordered coffee without flinching. And when someone complimented her skin, she didn’t panic or look away.

Eventually one of the club leaders wanted to learn more about me and why I was in the club but never participated. That was more or less the final crescendo and I broke down crying about how I felt so religiously lost. And I'm not talking a cutesy whimper... I'm talking waterfall of tears, scrunched up red face, and intangible whining.

It took the firemen nearly three weeks to get the forest fire under control. Now that all the great trees had been burnt, there was danger that heavy rain would cause serious floods which destroy the surrounding villages. To prevent this, the forest authorities ordered grass seed which was sprayed over the ground by planes for nearly a month. By the time that it began to rain, the grass had taken root in many places.",1,1751440208.0,MyEnglishLog,0,1.0,False

I recently bought a new espresso machine and grinder and we want to make a table for it. For the table top we’d like to use a piece of pressed wood we have left over from when we made our coffee table (it has this marble-like print on it and fits into our living room quite well). It is almost a square, around 60x62cm (and ~1.8cm thick). For the table legs we would like to use IKEA Mittback, because the aesthetic looks good in our living room (https://www.ikea.com/cz/en/p/mittback-trestle-birch-30459997/)

Now the problem I’m having - I am not convinced this setup is okay without any additional reinforcement. The coffee machine is about 7kg, the grinder is about 6kg, plus when I make the coffee I have to push on it (supposed to be 15-20kg of force but obviously it could be more since I’m doing this by hand). So there is a lot of force and I’m just not sure the pressed wood can handle it.

I was quite unsuccessful in googling some ways of reinforcing this, would anyone here be able to help?

I’m working on a new app idea made *specifically for introverts* — and I’d love your feedback before building it out fully.

It’s called **Introvert Connect** — a calm, pressure-free space where introverts can join one-on-one or small group voice chats with other introverts around the world. If no one’s available, an **AI companion** joins and talks with you like a real person. The goal is to create a space where socializing feels natural and not draining.

🔹 **What It Does:**

* You tap a button to join a **group or 1-on-1 conversation room**.
* The app matches you with other introverts around the world (based on your mood or interests).
* If **no one’s available**, an **AI companion** joins and talks with you — like a human.
* The AI or the app suggests **topics** so you never have to stress about “what to say”.
* You can talk via **voice** or **just listen**, even anonymously.
* It tracks your social progress (like comfort level, streaks, total talk time).
* Optional rooms like “Book Lovers”, “Late Night Talkers”, “Quiet Hangouts”.

Most social platforms are loud, fast, and overwhelming — this one is designed to feel like a safe, comfortable coffee chat with people who *get it*.

Would you personally use something like this? What kind of features would make it a yes for you?

  LESSON LEARNED: If you take a Valkyrie out for coffee, you’ll get stuck with the check and a dead body.  
  
  I hadn’t seen Samirah al-Abbas in almost six weeks, so when she called out of the blue and said we needed to talk about a matter of life and death, I agreed right away.  
  
  (Technically I’m already dead, which means the whole life-and-death thing didn’t apply, but still…Sam sounded anxious.)  
  
  She hadn’t yet arrived when I got to the Thinking Cup on Newbury Street. The place was packed as usual, so I queued up for coffee. A few seconds later, Sam flew in—literally—right over the heads of the café patrons.  
  
  Nobody batted an eye. Regular mortals aren’t good at processing magical stuff, which is fortunate, because otherwise Bostonians would spend most of their time running around in a panic from giants, trolls, ogres, and einherjar with battle-axes and lattes.  
  
  Sam landed next to me in her school uniform—white sneakers, khaki slacks, and a long-sleeve navy shirt with the King Academy logo. A green hijab covered her hair. An ax hung from her belt. I was pretty sure the ax wasn’t standard dress code.  
  
  As glad as I was to see her, I noted that the skin under her eyes was darker than usual. She was swaying on her feet.  
  
  “Hey,” I said. “You look terrible.”  
  
  “Nice to see you, too, Magnus.”  
  
  “No, I mean…not terrible like different than normal terrible. Just terrible like exhausted.”  
  
  “Should I get you a shovel so you can dig that hole a little deeper?”  
  
  I raised my hands in surrender. “Where have you been the last month and a half?”  
  
  Her shoulders tightened. “My workload this semester has been killing me. I’m tutoring kids after school. Then, as you might remember, there’s my part-time job reaping souls of the dead and running top secret missions for Odin.”  
  
  “You kids today and your busy schedules.”  
  
  “On top of all that…there’s flight school.”  
  
  “Flight school?” We shuffled forward with the line. “Like airplanes?”  
  
  I knew Sam’s goal was to become a professional pilot someday, but I hadn’t realized she was already taking lessons. “You can do that at sixteen?”  
  
  Her eyes sparkled with excitement. “My grandparents could never have afforded it, but the Fadlans have this friend who runs a flight school. They finally convinced Jid and Bibi—”  
  
  “Ah.” I grinned. “So the lessons were a gift from Amir.”  
  
  Sam blushed. She’s the only teenager I know who has a betrothed, and it’s cute how flustered she gets when she talks about Amir Fadlan.  
  
  “Those lessons were the most thoughtful, the most considerate…” She sighed wistfully. “But enough of that. I didn’t bring you here to talk about my schedule. We have an informant to meet.”  
  
  “An informant?”  
  
  “This could be the break I’ve been waiting for. If his information is good—”  
  
  Sam’s phone buzzed. She fished it out of her pocket, checked the screen, and cursed. “I have to go.”  
  
  “You just got here.”  
  
  “Valkyrie business. Possible code three-eight-one: heroic death in progress.”  
  
  “You’re making that up.”  
  
  “I’m not.”  
  
  “So…what, somebody thinks they’re about to die and they text you ‘Going down! Need Valkyrie ASAP!’ followed by a bunch of sad-face emojis?”  
  
  “I seem to recall taking your soul to Valhalla. You didn’t text me.”  
  
  “No, but I’m special.”  
  
  “Just get a table outside,” she said. “Meet my informant. I’ll be back as soon as I can.”  
  
  “I don’t even know what your informant looks like.”  
  
  “You’ll recognize him when you see him,” Sam promised. “Be brave. Also, get me a scone.”  
  
  She flew out of the shop like Super Muslima, leaving me to pay for our order.  
  
  I got two large coffees and two scones and found a table outside.  
  
  Spring had arrived early in Boston. Patches of dirty snow still clung to the curbs like dental plaque, but the cherry trees popped with white and red buds. Flowery pastel clothing displays bloomed in the windows of high-end boutiques. Tourists strolled by enjoying the sunshine.  
  
  Sitting outside, comfortable in my freshly laundered jeans, T-shirt, and denim jacket, I realized this would be the first spring in three years that I hadn’t been homeless.  
  
  Last March, I had been scrounging from Dumpsters. I’d been sleeping under a bridge in the Public Garden, hanging out with my buddies Hearth and Blitz, avoiding the cops and just trying to stay alive.  
  
  Then, two months ago, I died fighting a fire giant. I’d woken up in the Hotel Valhalla as one of Odin’s einherji warriors.  
  
  Now I had clean clothes. I took a shower every day. I slept in a comfortable bed every night. I could sit at this café table, eating food I’d actually paid for, and not worry about when the staff would force me to move along.  
  
  Since my rebirth, I’d gotten used to a lot of weird stuff. I’d traveled the Nine Worlds meeting Norse gods, elves, dwarves, and a bunch of monsters with names I couldn’t pronounce. I’d scored a magical sword that presently hung around my neck in the form of a runestone pendant. I’d even had a mind-melting conversation with my cousin Annabeth about the Greek gods who hung out in New York and made her life difficult. Apparently North America was lousy with ancient gods. We had a full-blown infestation.  
  
  All of that I’d learned to accept.  
  
  But being back in Boston on a nice spring day, hanging out like a regular mortal kid?  
  
  That felt strange.  
  
  I scanned the crowd of pedestrians, looking for Sam’s informant. You’ll recognize him when you see him, she’d promised. I wondered what kind of information this guy had, and why Sam considered it life-and-death.  
  
  My gaze fixed on a storefront at the end of the block. Over the doorway, the brass-and-silver sign still gleamed proudly: BLITZEN’S BEST, but the shop was shuttered. The front door window was papered over on the inside, with a message hastily scrawled in red marker: Closed for remodeling. Back soon!  
  
  I’d been hoping to ask Samirah about that. I had no idea why my old friend Blitz had abruptly disappeared. One day a few weeks ago, I’d just walked by the shop and found it closed. Since then, there’d been no word from Blitzen or Hearthstone, which wasn’t like them.  
  
  Thinking about this made me so preoccupied I almost didn’t see our informant until he was right on top of me. But Sam was correct: he kind of stood out. It’s not every day you see a goat in a trench coat.  
  
  A porkpie hat was wedged between his curly horns. A pair of sunglasses perched on his nose. His trench coat kept getting tangled in his back hooves.  
  
  Despite his clever disguise, I recognized him. I’d killed and eaten this particular goat on another world, which is the sort of bonding experience you don’t forget.  
  
  “Otis,” I said.  
  
  “Shhh,” he said. “I’m incognito. Call me…Otis.”  
  
  “I’m not sure that’s how incognito works, but okay.”  
  
  Otis, aka Otis, climbed into the chair I’d reserved for Sam. He sat on his back haunches and put his front hooves on the table. “Where is the Valkyrie? Is she incognito, too?” He peered at the nearest pastry bag as if Sam might be hiding inside.  
  
  “Samirah had to go reap a soul,” I said. “She’ll be back soon.”  
  
  “It must be nice having a purpose in life.” Otis sighed. “Well, thank you for the food.”  
  
  “That’s not for—”  
  
  Otis snapped up Sam’s scone bag and began to eat it, paper and all.  
  
  At the table next to us, an older couple glanced at my goat friend and smiled. Maybe their mortal senses perceived him a  
s a cute child or a funny pet dog.  
  
  “So.” I had a hard time watching Otis devour the pastry, spraying crumbs across the lapels of his trench coat. “You had something to tell us?”  
  
  Otis belched. “It’s about my master.”  
  
  “Thor.”  
  
  Otis flinched. “Yes, him.”  
  
  If I worked for the thunder god, I too would have flinched when I heard Thor’s name. Otis and his brother, Marvin, pulled the god’s chariot. They also provided Thor with a never-ending supply of goat meat. Each night, Thor killed and ate them for dinner. Each morning, Thor resurrected them. This is why you should go to college, kids—so when you grow up you do not have to take a job as a magical goat.  
  
  “I finally have a lead,” Otis said, “on that certain object my master is missing.”  
  
  “You mean his ham—?”  
  
  “Don’t say it aloud!” Otis warned. “But, yes…his ham.”  
  
  I flashed back to January, when I’d first met the thunder god. Good times around the campfire, listening to Thor fart, talk about his favorite TV shows, fart, complain about his missing hammer, which he used to kill giants and stream his favorite TV shows, and fart.  
  
  “It’s still missing?” I asked.  
  
  Otis clacked his front hooves on the tabletop. “Well, not officially, of course. If the giants knew for certain that Thor was without his you-know-what, they would invade the mortal worlds, destroy everything, and send me into a very deep funk. But unofficially…yes. We’ve been searching for months with no luck. Thor’s enemies are getting bolder. They sense weakness. I told my therapist it reminds me of when I was a kid in the goat pen and the bullies were sizing me up.” Otis got a faraway look in his yellow slit-pupil eyes. “I think that’s when my traumatic stress started.”  
  
  This was my cue to spend the next several hours talking to Otis about his feelings. Being a terrible person, I just said “I feel your pain” and moved on.  
  
  “Otis,” I said, “the last time we saw you, we found Thor a nice iron staff to use as a backup weapon. He’s not exactly defenseless.”  
  
  “No, but the staff is not as good as the…ham. It doesn’t inspire the same fear in the giants. Also, Thor gets cranky trying to watch his shows on the staff. The screen is tiny, and the resolution is terrible. I don’t like it when Thor is cranky. It makes it hard for me to find my happy space.”  
  
  A lot about this did not make sense: why Thor would have so much trouble locating his own hammer; how he could possibly have kept its loss a secret from the giants for so long; and the idea that Otis the goat would have a happy space.  
  
  “So Thor wants our help,” I guessed.  
  
  “Not officially.”  
  
  “Of course not. We’ll all have to wear trench coats and glasses.”  
  
  “That’s an excellent idea,” Otis said. “Anyway, I told the Valkyrie I would keep her updated since she is in charge of Odin’s…you know, special missions. This is the first good lead I’ve gotten to the location of the certain object. My source is reliable. He’s another goat who goes to the same psychiatrist. He overheard some talk in his barnyard.”  
  
  “You want us to track down a lead based on barnyard gossip you heard in your psychiatrist’s waiting room.”  
  
  “That would be great.” Otis leaned so far forward I was afraid he might fall out of his chair. “But you’re going to have to be careful.”  
  
  It took all my effort not to laugh. I’d played catch-the-lava-ball with fire giants. I’d eagle-skied over the rooftops of Boston. I’d pulled the World Serpent out of Massachusetts Bay and defeated Fenris Wolf with a ball of yarn. Now this goat was telling me to be careful.  
  
  “So where is the ham?” I asked. “Jotunheim? Niflheim? Thorfartheim?”  
  
  “You’re teasing.” Otis’s sunglasses slipped sideways on his snout. “But the ham is in a different dangerous location. It’s in Provincetown.”  
  
  “Provincetown,” I repeated. “On the tip of Cape Cod.”  
  
  I had vague memories of the place. My mom had taken me there for a weekend one summer when I was about eight. I remembered beaches, saltwater taffy, lobster rolls, and a bunch of art galleries. The most dangerous thing we’d encountered was a seagull with irritable bowel syndrome.  
  
  Otis lowered his voice. “There is a barrow in Provincetown—a wight’s barrow.”  
  
  “Is that like a wheelbarrow?”  
  
  “No, no. A wight…” Otis shuddered. “Well, a wight is a powerful undead creature that likes to collect magical weapons. A wight’s tomb is called a—a barrow. Sorry, I have a hard time talking about wights. They remind me of my father.”  
  
  That raised another batch of questions about Otis’s childhood, but I decided to leave them for his therapist.  
  
  “Are there a lot of lairs of undead Vikings in Provincetown?” I asked.  
  
  “Only one, as far as I know. But that’s enough. If the certain object is there, it will be difficult to retrieve—underground, and guarded by powerful magic. You’ll need your friends—the dwarf and the elf.”  
  
  That would have been great, if I had any idea where those friends were. I hoped Sam knew more than I did.  
  
  “Why doesn’t Thor go and check this barrow himself?” I asked. “Wait…let me guess. He doesn’t want to draw attention. Or he wants us to have a chance to be heroes. Or it’s hard work and he has some shows to catch up on.”  
  
  “To be fair,” Otis said, “the new season of Jessica Jones did just start streaming.”  
  
  It’s not the goat’s fault, I told myself. He does not deserve to be punched.  
  
  “Fine,” I said. “When Sam gets here, we’ll talk strategy.”  
  
  “I’m not sure I should wait with you.” Otis licked a crumb off his lapel. “I should have mentioned this earlier, but you see, someone…or something…has been stalking me.”  
  
  The hairs on my neck tingled. “You think they followed you here?”  
  
  “I’m not sure,” Otis said. “Hopefully my disguise threw them off.”  
  
  Oh, great, I thought.  
  
  I scanned the street but saw no obvious lurkers. “Did you get a good look at this someone/something?”  
  
  “No,” Otis admitted. “But Thor has all sorts of enemies who would want to stop us from getting his—his ham back. They would not want me sharing information with you, especially this last part. You have to warn Samirah that—”  
  
  THUNK.  
  
  Living in Valhalla, I was used to deadly weapons flying out of nowhere, but I was still surprised when an ax sprouted from Otis’s furry chest.  
  
  I lunged across the table to help him. As the son of Frey, god of fertility and health, I can do some pretty awesome first aid magic given enough time. But as soon as I touched Otis, I sensed that it was too late. The ax had pierced his heart.  
  
  “Oh, dear.” Otis coughed blood. “I’ll just…die…now.”  
  
  His head lolled backward. His porkpie hat rolled across the pavement. The lady sitting behind us screamed as if just now noticing that Otis was not a cute puppy dog. He was, in fact, a dead goat.  
  
  I scanned the rooftops across the street. Judging from the angle of the ax, it must have been thrown from somewhere up there…yes. I caught a flicker of movement just as the attacker ducked out of sight—a figure in black wearing some sort of metal helmet.  
  
  So much for a leisurely cup of coffee. I yanked the magical pendant from my neck chain and raced after the goat-assassin.  
  
  Your Standard Rooftop Chase Scene with Talking Swords and Ninjas  
  
  I SHOULD introduce my sword.  
  
  Jack, these are the peeps. Peeps, this is Jack.  
  
  His real name is Sumarbrander, the Sword of Summer, but Jack prefers Jack because reasons. When Jack feels like snoozing, which is most of the time, he hangs out on a chain around my neck in the form of a pendant marked with fehu, the rune of Frey:  
  
  When I need his help, he turns into a sword and kills things. Sometimes he does this while I wield him. Other times he does this while flying around on his own and singing annoying pop songs. He is magical that way.  
  
  As  
I bounded across Newbury Street, Jack sprang to full form in my hand. His blade—thirty inches of double-edged bone-forged steel—was emblazoned with runes that pulsed in different colors when Jack talked.  
  
  “What’s going on?” he asked. “Who are we killing?”  
  
  Jack claims he doesn’t pay attention to my conversations when he is in pendant form. He says he usually has his headphones on. I don’t believe this, because Jack doesn’t have headphones. Or ears.  
  
  “Chasing assassin,” I blurted out, dodging a taxi. “Killed goat.”  
  
  “Right,” Jack said. “Same old, same old, then.”  
  
  I leaped up the side of the Pearson Publishing building. I’d spent the last two months learning to use my einherji powers, so one jump took me to a ledge three stories above the main entrance—no problem, even with a sword in one hand. Then I hop-climbed from window ledge to cornice up the white marble facade, channeling my inner Hulk until I reached the top.  
  
  On the far side of the roof, a dark bipedal shape was just disappearing behind a row of chimneys. The goat-killer looked humanoid, which ruled out goat-on-goat homicide, but I’d seen enough of the Nine Worlds to know that humanoid didn’t mean human. He could be an elf, a dwarf, a small giant, or even an ax-murderer god. (Please, not an ax-murderer god.)  
  
  By the time I reached the chimneys, my quarry had jumped to the roof of the next building. That might not sound impressive, but the next building was a brownstone mansion about fifty feet away across a small parking lot. The goat-killer didn’t even have the decency to break his ankles on impact. He somersaulted on the tar and came up running. Then he leaped back across Newbury Street and landed on the steeple of the Church of the Covenant.  
  
  “I hate this guy,” I said.  
  
  “How do you know it’s a guy?” Jack asked.  
  
  The sword had a point. (Sorry, I keep stumbling into that pun.) The goat-killer’s loose black clothes and metal war helmet made it impossible to guess his or her gender, but I decided to keep thinking of him as male for now. Not sure why. I guess I found the idea of a bro goat-assassin more annoying.  
  
  I backed up, took a running start, and leaped toward the church.  
  
  I’d love to tell you I landed on the steeple, slapped some handcuffs on the killer, and announced, You’re going away for livestock murder!  
  
  Instead…well, the Church of the Covenant has these beautiful stained glass windows made by Tiffany in the 1890s. On the left side of the sanctuary, one window has a big crack at the top. My bad.  
  
  I hit the church’s slanted roof and slid back, grabbing the gutter with my right hand. Spikes of pain shot up my fingernails. I dangled from the ledge, my legs flailing, kicking the beautiful stained glass window right in the Baby Jesus.  
  
  On the bright side, swinging precariously from the roof saved my life. Just as I twisted, an ax hurtled from above, slicing the buttons off my denim jacket. A centimeter closer and it would’ve opened up my chest.  
  
  “Hey!” I yelled.  
  
  I tend to complain when people try to kill me. Sure, in Valhalla we einherjar are constantly killing each other, and we get resurrected in time for dinner. But outside Valhalla, I was very much killable. If I died in Boston, I would not be getting a cosmic do-over.  
  
  The goat-assassin peered down at me from the peak of the roof. Thank the gods, he appeared to be out of throwing axes. Unfortunately, he still had a sword at his side. His leggings and tunic were stitched from black fur. A soot-smeared chain mail coat hung loosely on his chest. His black iron helmet had a chain mail curtain around the base—what we in the Viking business call an aventail—completely covering his neck and throat. His features were obscured by a faceplate fashioned to resemble a snarling wolf.  
 Of course a wolf. Everybody in the Nine Worlds loves wolves. They have wolf shields, wolf helmets, wolf screen savers, wolf pajamas, and wolf-themed birthday parties.  
  
  Me, not so much loving the wolves.  
  
  “Take a hint, Magnus Chase.” The assassin’s voice warbled, modulating from soprano to baritone as if going through a special effects machine. “Stay away from Provincetown.”  
  
  The fingers of my left hand tightened on the hilt of my sword. “Jack, do your thing.”  
  
  “You sure about that?” Jack asked.  
  
  The assassin hissed. For some reason, people are often shocked when they find out my sword can talk.  
  
  “I mean,” Jack continued, “I know this guy killed Otis, but everybody kills Otis. Getting killed is part of Otis’s job description.”  
  
  “Just chop off his head or something!” I yelled.  
  
  The assassin, not being an idiot, turned and fled.  
  
  “Get him!” I told Jack.  
  
  “Why do I have to do all the hard work?” Jack complained.  
  
  “Because I’m dangling here and you can’t be killed!”  
  
  “Just because you’re right doesn’t make this cool.”  
  
  I flung him overhead. Jack spiraled out of view, flying after the goat-killer while singing his own version of “Shake It Off.” (I have never been able to convince him that the line isn’t cheese graters gonna grate, grate, grate, grate, grate.)  
  
  Even with my left hand free, it took me a few seconds to haul myself up to the roof. Somewhere to the north, the clanging of blades echoed off brick buildings. I raced in that direction, leaping over the church’s turrets, launching myself across Berkeley Street. I bounced from rooftop to rooftop until I heard Jack yell in the distance, “OW!”  
  
  Most people might not run into battle to check on the welfare of their swords, but that’s what I did. At the corner of Boylston, I scrambled up the side of a parking garage, got to the roof level, and found Jack fighting for his…well, maybe not his life, but at least his dignity.  
  
  Jack often bragged that he was the sharpest blade in the Nine Worlds. He could cut through anything and fight a dozen enemies at once. I tended to believe him, since I’d personally seen him take out giants the size of skyscrapers. Yet the goat-killer was having no trouble forcing him back across the roof. The assassin might have been small, but he was strong and quick. His dark iron sword sparked against Jack. Every time the two blades connected, Jack yelped, “Ow! Ow!”  
  
  I didn’t know if Jack was in real danger, but I had to help. Since I didn’t have another weapon and I didn’t feel like fighting empty-handed, I ran to the nearest lamppost and ripped it out of the cement.  
  
  That sounds like I was showing off. Honestly, I wasn’t. The pole was just the handiest weapon-like object I could find—except for a parked Lexus, and I wasn’t quite strong enough to wield a luxury automobile.  
  
  I charged the goat-killer with my twenty-foot-long jousting light fixture. That got his attention. As he turned toward me, Jack lashed out, opening a deep cut in the assassin’s thigh. The goat-killer grunted and stumbled.  
  
  That was my chance. I could have taken him down. Instead, when I was ten feet away, a distant howl cut through the air and froze me in my tracks.  
  
  Jeez, Magnus, you’re thinking, it was only a distant howl. What’s the big deal?  
  
  I may have mentioned I don’t like wolves. When I was fourteen, two of them with glowing blue eyes killed my mother. My recent encounter with Fenris hadn’t done anything to increase my appreciation for the species.  
  
  This particular howl was definitely that of a wolf. It came from somewhere across the Boston Common, reverberating off the high-rises, turning my blood to Freon. It was exactly the same sound I’d heard the night of my mother’s death—hungry and triumphant, the baying of a monster that had found its prey.  
  
  The lamppost slipped from my grip, clanging against the asphalt.  
  
  Jack floated to my side. “Uh, señor…are we still fighting this guy or what?”  
  
  The assassin staggered backward. The black fur of his leggings glistened with blood. “And so it begins.” His voice sounded even more garbled. “Beware, Magnus. If you go to Provincetown, you will play into your enemy’s hands.”  
  
  I stared at that snarling face mask. I felt like I was fourteen again, alone in the alley behind my apartment the night my mother died. I remembered gazing up at the fire escape from which I had just dropped, hearing the wolves howl from our living room. Then flames exploded from the windows.  
  
  “Who—who are you?” I managed.  
  
  The assassin let out a guttural laugh. “Wrong question. The right question: Are you prepared to lose your friends? If not, you should leave Thor’s hammer lost.”  
  
  He backed to the edge of the roof and toppled over.  
  
  I ran to the ledge just as a flock of pigeons surged upward, rising in a blue-gray cloud, swirling away over the Back Bay’s forest of chimneys. Down below: no movement, no body, no sign of the assassin.  
  
  Jack hovered next to me. “I’ve could’ve taken him. You just caught me unprepared. I didn’t have time to do my stretches.”  
  
  “Swords don’t stretch,” I said.  
  
  “Oh, excuse me, Mr. Expert on Proper Warm-up Techniques!”  
  
  A tuft of pigeon down helicoptered to the ledge and stuck in a smear of the assassin’s blood. I picked up the tiny feather and watched red liquid soak into it.  
  
  “So what now?” Jack asked. “And what was that wolf howl?”  
  
  Ice water trickled down my eustachian tubes, leaving a cold, bitter taste in my mouth. “I don’t know,” I said. “Whatever it was, it’s stopped now.”  
  
  “Should we go check it out?”  
  
  “No! I mean…by the time we figured out where the sound came from, we’d be too late to do anything about it. Besides…”  
  
  I studied the bloody pigeon feather. I wondered how the goat-killer had disappeared so effectively, and what he knew about Thor’s missing hammer. His distorted voice reverberated in my mind: Are you prepared to lose your friends?  
  
  Something about the assassin had seemed very wrong…yet very familiar.  
  
  “We have to get back to Sam.” I grabbed Jack’s hilt and exhaustion washed over me.  
  
  The downside of having a sword who fights on his own: whatever Jack did, I paid the price as soon as he returned to my hand. I felt bruises spreading across my arms—one for each time Jack had been struck by the other sword. My legs trembled like they’d been doing lunges all morning. A lump of emotion formed in my throat—Jack’s shame for letting the goat-killer fight him to a standstill.  
  
  “Hey, man,” I told him, “at least you cut him. That’s more than I did.”  
  
  “Yeah, well…” Jack sounded embarrassed. I knew he didn’t like sharing the bad stuff with me. “Maybe you should rest for a minute, señor. You’re in no shape—”  
  
  “I’m all right,” I said. “Thanks, Jack. You did good.”  
  
  I willed him to return to pendant form, then reattached the runestone to my neck chain.  
  
  Jack was right about one thing: I needed rest. I felt like crawling inside that nice Lexus and taking a nap, but if the goat-assassin decided to double back to the Thinking Cup, if he caught Sam unaware…  
  
  I took off across the rooftops, hoping I wasn’t too late.  
  
  My Friends Protect Me by Telling Me Absolutely Nothing. Thanks, Friends  
  
  BACK AT the café, Sam was standing over Otis’s body.  
  
  Customers walked in and out of the Thinking Cup, making a wide arc around the dead goat. They didn’t seem alarmed. Maybe they saw Otis as a passed-out homeless guy. Some of my best friends were passed-out homeless guys. I knew how well they could repel a crowd.  
  
  Sam frowned at me. Under her left eye was a new orange bruise. “Why is our informant dead?”  
  
  “Long story,” I said. “Who hit you?”  
  
  “Also a long story.”  
  
  “Sam—”  
  
  She waved aside my concern. “I’m fine. Just please tell me you didn’t kill Otis becaus  
e he ate my scone.”  
  
  “No. Now if he’d eaten my scone—”  
  
  “Ha, ha. What happened?”  
  
  I was still worried about Sam’s eye, but I did my best to explain about the goat-killer. Meanwhile, Otis’s form began to dissolve, melting into curls of white vapor like dry ice. Soon there was nothing left but the trench coat, the glasses, the porkpie hat, and the ax that had killed him.  
  
  Sam picked up the assassin’s weapon. The blade was no larger than a smartphone, but the edge looked sharp. The dark metal was etched with soot-black runes.  
  
  “Giant-forged iron,” Sam said. “Enchanted. Perfectly weighted. This is a valuable weapon to leave behind.”  
  
  “That’s nice. I’d hate for Otis to be killed with a shoddy weapon.”  
  
  Sam ignored me. She’d gotten pretty good at that. “You say the killer wore a wolf helm?”  
  
  “Which narrows it down to half the baddies in the Nine Worlds.” I gestured at Otis’s empty coat. “Where did his body go?”  
  
  “Otis? He’ll be fine. Magic creatures form from the mist of Ginnungagap. When they die, their bodies eventually dissolve back into that mist. Otis should re-form somewhere close to his master, hopefully in time for Thor to kill him again for dinner.”  
  
  That struck me as a strange thing to hope for, but not any stranger than the morning I’d just had. Before my knees could buckle, I sat. I sipped my now-cold coffee.  
  
  “The goat-killer knew the hammer is missing,” I said. “He told me if we went to Provincetown we’d be playing into our enemy’s hands. You don’t think he meant—”  
  
  “Loki?” Sam sat across from me. She tossed the ax on the table. “I’m sure he’s involved in this somehow. He always is.”  
  
  I couldn’t blame her for sounding bitter. Sam didn’t like talking about the god of deceit and trickery. Aside from the fact he was evil, he was also her dad.  
  
  “You heard from him recently?” I asked.  
  
  “Just a few dreams.” Sam rotated her coffee cup this way and that like the dial of a safe. “Whispers, warnings. He’s been mostly interested in…Never mind. Nothing.”  
  
  “That doesn’t sound like nothing.”  
  
  Sam’s gaze was intense and full of heat, like logs in a fireplace just before they ignite. “My dad is trying to wreck my personal life,” she said. “That’s nothing new. He wants to keep me distracted. My grandparents, Amir…” Her voice caught. “It’s nothing I can’t handle. It doesn’t have anything to do with our hammer problem.”  
  
  “You sure?”  
  
  Her expression told me to back off. In times past, if I pressed her too far, she would slam me against a wall and put her arm across my throat. The fact that she hadn’t yet choked me unconscious was a sign of our deepening friendship.  
  
  “Anyway,” Sam said, “Loki couldn’t be your goat-killer. He couldn’t wield an ax like that.”  
  
  “Why not? I mean, I know he’s technically chained up in Asgardian supermax for murder or whatever, but he doesn’t seem to have any problem showing up in my face whenever he feels like it.”  
  
  “My father can project his image or appear in a dream,” Sam said. “With extreme concentration, for a limited time, he can even send out enough of his power to take on a physical form.”  
  
  “Like when he dated your mom.”  
  
  Sam again demonstrated her affection for me by not clubbing my brains out. We were having a friendship fest here at the Thinking Cup.  
  
  “Yes,” she said. “He can get around his imprisonment in those ways, but he can’t manifest solidly enough to wield magic weapons. The gods made sure of that when they put a spell on his bindings. If he could pick up an enchanted blade, he could eventually free himself.”  
  
  I supposed that made sense in a nonsensical Norse-myth kind of way. I pictured Loki lying spread-eagled in some cave, his hands and feet tied with bonds made from—ugh, I could hardly think about it—the intestines of his own murdered sons. The gods had arranged that. They’d also supposedly set a snake over Loki’s head to drip venom in his face for all eternity. Asgardian justice wasn’t big on mercy.  
  
  “The goat-killer could still be working for Loki,” I said. “He could be a giant. He could be—”  
  
  “He could be anyone,” Sam said. “The way you describe him—how he fought and moved—he sounds like an einherji. Perhaps even a Valkyrie.”  
  
  My stomach dropped. I imagined it rolling across the pavement and coming to rest next to Otis’s porkpie hat. “Somebody from Valhalla. Why would anyone—?”  
  
  “I don’t know,” Sam said. “Whoever it is, he or she doesn’t want us following this lead on Thor’s hammer. But I don’t see that we have any choice. We need to act quickly.”  
  
  “Why the rush?” I asked. “The hammer’s been missing for months. The giants haven’t attacked yet.”  
  
  Something in Sam’s eyes reminded me of Ran the sea goddess’s nets, the way they swirled in the waves, stirring up drowned spirits. It wasn’t a happy memory.  
  
  “Magnus,” she said, “events are accelerating. My last few missions into Jotunheim…the giants are restless. They’ve summoned huge glamours to hide whatever it is they’re up to, but I’m pretty sure whole armies are on the move. They’re preparing to invade.”  
  
  “Invade…where?”  
  
  The breeze made her hijab flutter around her face. “Here, Magnus. And if they come to destroy Midgard…”  
  
  Despite the warm sunlight, a chill settled over me. Sam had explained how Boston sat at the nexus of Yggdrasil, the World Tree. It was the easiest place to pass between the Nine Worlds. I imagined the shadows of giants falling over Newbury Street, the ground shaking under iron-shod boots the size of panzer tanks.  
  
  “The only thing holding them back,” Sam said, “is their fear of Thor. That’s been true for centuries. They won’t launch a full-scale invasion unless they’re absolutely sure he is vulnerable. But they’re getting bolder. They’re starting to suspect the time might be right—”  
  
  “Thor’s only one god,” I said. “What about Odin? Or Tyr? Or my dad, Frey? Can’t they fight giants?”  
  
  As soon as I said it, the idea sounded ridiculous. Odin was unpredictable. When he showed up, he was more interested in giving motivational PowerPoint presentations than fighting. I’d never even met Tyr, the god of bravery and personal combat. As for Frey…my dad was the god of summer and fertility. If you wanted flowers to bloom, crops to grow, or a paper cut to heal, he was your guy. Scaring away the hordes of Jotunheim? Maybe not......

Here I am trying to explain some strategy to achieve this across platform:

**• Define a clear, relatable campaign goal:** you should center your campaign around a purpose that can resonate with your audience such as couse, value, or also shared experience. For example a clothing brand can launch a campaign called # WearYourValues, this can help to encourage users to share stories about why eco-friendly fashion matters to them.

**• Create shareable, high value content:** develop content that should informative, entertaining, or emotional because this can encourage organic sharing. You should designed the spark conversion without promotional overtones.

**• Leverage user generated content:** you can invite your audience to contribute content that tied to your camping. For example a coffee brand can ask followers to post their morning coffee rituals with a hashtag. This can build a community and amplifies range without paying exposure.

 **• Tap into platform specific trends:** create your campaign with the organic trends or also challenges on each platform. For example on Instagram you can use reels to join trending audio or also meme formats, with your brand's message.

**• Foster community interaction:** you should create opportunities for two way engagement such as hosting a Q&A session, polls, for also live text based discussions.

**• Use storytelling to build connection:** you should share authentic and reliable content. For example a small business could post a weekly like ' founder's journal' on LinkedIn or Instagram and you can detailing real challenges or Your winning also. We can help to humanize your brand and also encourage your followers to root of your journey.

**• Optimize for virality through emotion or humour:** create content that include strong emotions, nostalgia or inspiration or also you can use humour to drive shares. For example a book store could post on Twitter like ' 10 books that changed how we see the world'. This can spark debate and retweets without a direct promotion.

**•Cross promote across platform:** you can share your campaign on multiple platforms. It can drive traffic between your profile without paid boosts.

**• Measure success qualitatively and quantitatively:** you should track organic reach through comments, shares, hashtag usage and also follower growth. You can use social listening tool to monitor sentiment and also identify what works. Adjust your campaign based on feedback to keep the campaign dynamic.

You can also consider partnering with experienced [marketing agency](https://g.co/kgs/KjxPFU8) if you want. It can help to achieve more growth without spending your time. To drive organic growth you can use these strategy with authenticity platform based content.",1,1751439236.0,SMMA,1,1.0,False
1lpp2ws,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1lpp2ws/a_message_to_end_a_friendship/,A message to end a friendship,"I work with the person I thought was my best friend. I really don't find it easy to connect with people, but over the course of 7 years I thought we had built a close friendship, and I had a friend for life.

Last year, she got pregnant. The first of my limited group of friends to have a baby, I was so excited for her and looking forward to sharing these amazing new adventures with her.

Last year, she was the first person I came out to as bi. I have been my whole life, but never planned on telling anyone. I've been with my wife for nearly 20 years, so aside from some incredibly stereotypical tastes in music it's not like anyone would know. I never trusted anyone enough with that information, over fear of being shunned. And I only told her to explain why I was stressing over my sister going to a highly anti-LGBT church. We're close enough now, you can know this is why. I didn't know at the time it would be the last time I saw her for over a year.

Started off well during her mat leave, messaging at least once a week but for the past few months she's been ignoring the 3 or 4 times I've asked if she wanted to catch-up up over coffee or a walk, and ghosting the ""how are you"" messages. It's been difficult, but promised I wouldn't make any decisions or take anything personally until I saw her in person again.

That was Monday, an annual function at work. We didn't really talk much, was just in each other's presence, but agreed to get the train home together. And it was amazing. Picked up right where we left off. Until she got off the train. I asked ""keep in touch?"". And she said ""I can't say I'm going to do that"".

I sent her a message when I got home as well. ""It was so good to see you. Loved hearing about how your daughter is doing. Being a mum suits you so well. I didn't know what to expect, but please don't leave it that long until the next time. Always going to be in your corner & supporting you."" And I just know it's going to be left on read.

I can't get that not keeping in touch comment out of my head. From someone I thought I had a close friendship with, feel pretty worthless. I've drafted the below message and going to send it next Monday.



Hey! I'm really sorry to send this, but I need to take a break from our friendship. I've not been able to get what you said about not keeping in touch out of my head.

When I said that I'd struggled over coming out to you, I felt I could because I was so confident in our friendship and that it was going to last. And I feel like I got that wrong. I know I've not always got things right, but I did the best I could to try to maintain it & adapt it round your new life. We shared so much last year, I saw you as my closest friend and a friend for life. I don't really make those kind of connections with people, and it feels like it's always going to mean more to me than it does to you. It actually hurt to hear you say that, and explains for me why you've ignored the few times I've asked if you wanted to catch up. I feel that if you respected me or our friendship, an answer of no is easier to accept than ghosting.

I have loved you in my life as a friend, and it's difficult to accept that I can't offer the same back. You've helped get me through some of the toughest of times, and pushed me towards some of my greatest achievements. I'm always going to appreciate that, and I'm not going to stop caring about you for it.

Everything I put in my last message was true. I have no doubt you are an amazing mum and I'm so happy for you. I'm always going to be supporting you and wanting the best for you. And I don't want or expect you to change any of your priorities. But for now, I need to prioritise my own health & well-being.

I’m working on a new app idea made *specifically for introverts* — and I’d love your feedback before building it out fully.

It’s called **Introvert Connect** — a calm, pressure-free space where introverts can join one-on-one or small group voice chats with other introverts around the world. If no one’s available, an **AI companion** joins and talks with you like a real person. The goal is to create a space where socializing feels natural and not draining.

🔹 **What It Does:**

* You tap a button to join a **group or 1-on-1 conversation room**.
* The app matches you with other introverts around the world (based on your mood or interests).
* If **no one’s available**, an **AI companion** joins and talks with you — like a human.
* The AI or the app suggests **topics** so you never have to stress about “what to say”.
* You can talk via **voice** or **just listen**, even anonymously.
* It tracks your social progress (like comfort level, streaks, total talk time).
* Optional rooms like “Book Lovers”, “Late Night Talkers”, “Quiet Hangouts”.

Most social platforms are loud, fast, and overwhelming — this one is designed to feel like a safe, comfortable coffee chat with people who *get it*.

I was diagnosed pre-diabetic back in late March. I had previously heard of intermittent fasting, and had seen youtube videos talking about its health benefits, but I never felt I needed to partake in it. Once I got this diagnosis, I decided to jump right into this lifestyle.



Starting Weight: 225 lbs, Starting Body Fat: 32%, **Starting HBA1C: 6.2%**



Here's all that I did:

1. Downloaded a calorie tracking app on my phone to aim for 150g protein, 150g carbs, and 115g fat (2235 total calories per day for fat loss)
2. Fasted 18:6 (Ate from 12:30p to 6:30p everyday)
3. Fasted weight training 4 days per week, and fasted cardio 2 days per week, all of which were done immediately before my first meal (Workout from 10:30ish am to 12pm)
4. Drink 1 cup black coffee with 1/4 tsp pink Himalayan salt before each workout or cardio session for energy (I've found that caffeine + electrolytes are the golden key for stamina while working out fasted!)
5. Prioritized protein, healthy fats, and hitting my calorie totals
6. Aim for 7 hours sleep per night minimum for good muscle recovery



I did repeat bloodwork one week ago (I've been doing intermittent fasting and fasted weight training for about 2 months now), and here are my results:



Current Weight: 220 lbs, Current Body Fat: 30%, **Current HBA1C: 5.9%**



Doctor said I'm doing a great job and that I should continue on track for even better results later this year.

Common questions arise when integrating pet-safe bike racks into a college campus. Here are a few important answers.

**Are the pet ⁣shelters easily cleaned and sanitized?**
Yes, the pet shelters are constructed with easy-to-clean materials,⁣ and‌ many models include removable trays or components for‌ thorough sanitation. ⁤Regular cleaning schedules are recommended ​to maintain hygiene.

The surfaces are generally non-porous to avoid harboring bacteria.Disinfectant solutions that are safe for animals can ​be used. Campus facilities management can easily maintain cleanliness with simple protocols.

**What measures are in⁤ place ​to‌ prevent the spread of diseases?**
The racks include measures ​like easily sanitized surfaces and strategically distanced‍ pet stations. Regular cleaning and maintenance⁢ protocols are essential to minimize ⁣the risk of disease ‍transmission.

The spacing between the pet stations can also help reduce contact between animals. Educating pet owners ⁣about responsible ‌pet ownership‌ and disease‍ prevention is also crucial. The campus could provide informational signage on best ⁣practices for preventing diseases in pets.

**Are the bike racks⁣ ADA compliant?**
Yes, the bike racks are designed to be ADA compliant, ⁢ensuring accessibility for individuals with disabilities. This includes appropriate spacing and accessible locking mechanisms.

The layout considers ⁣wheelchair accessibility and provides clear pathways ⁤to the bike‍ and pet stations. The locking mechanisms are designed‍ to be easily operated by individuals with limited mobility. Consultation with accessibility experts‍ throughout the design phase ensured adherence to guidelines.

I’m working on a new app idea made *specifically for introverts* — and I’d love your feedback before building it out fully.

It’s called **Introvert Connect** — a calm, pressure-free space where introverts can join one-on-one or small group voice chats with other introverts around the world. If no one’s available, an **AI companion** joins and talks with you like a real person. The goal is to create a space where socializing feels natural and not draining.

🔹 **What It Does:**

* You tap a button to join a **group or 1-on-1 conversation room**.
* The app matches you with other introverts around the world (based on your mood or interests).
* If **no one’s available**, an **AI companion** joins and talks with you — like a human.
* The AI or the app suggests **topics** so you never have to stress about “what to say”.
* You can talk via **voice** or **just listen**, even anonymously.
* It tracks your social progress (like comfort level, streaks, total talk time).
* Optional rooms like “Book Lovers”, “Late Night Talkers”, “Quiet Hangouts”.

Most social platforms are loud, fast, and overwhelming — this one is designed to feel like a safe, comfortable coffee chat with people who *get it*.

Would you personally use something like this? What kind of features would make it a yes for you?

I was diagnosed pre-diabetic back in late March. I had previously heard of intermittent fasting, and had seen youtube videos talking about its health benefits, but I never felt I needed to partake in it. Once I got this diagnosis, I decided to jump right into this lifestyle.



Starting Weight: 225 lbs, Starting Body Fat: 32%, **Starting HBA1C: 6.2%**



Here's all that I did:

1. Downloaded a calorie tracking app on my phone to aim for 150g protein, 150g carbs, and 115g fat (2235 total calories per day for fat loss)
2. Fasted 18:6 (Ate from 12:30p to 6:30p everyday)
3. Fasted weight training 4 days per week, and fasted cardio 2 days per week, all of which were done immediately before my first meal (Workout from 10:30ish am to 12pm)
4. Drink 1 cup black coffee with 1/4 tsp pink Himalayan salt before each workout or cardio session for energy (I've found that caffeine + electrolytes are the golden key for stamina while working out fasted!)
5. Prioritized protein, healthy fats, and hitting my calorie totals
6. Aim for 7 hours sleep per night minimum for good muscle recovery



I did repeat bloodwork one week ago (I've been doing intermittent fasting and fasted weight training for about 2 months now), and here are my results:



Current Weight: 220 lbs, Current Body Fat: 30%, **Current HBA1C: 5.9%**



Doctor said I'm doing a great job and that I should continue on track for even better results later this year. I feel damn proud of myself, and I definitely plan on continuing this lifestyle for the foreseeable future. Intermittent Fasting works wonders, and I'm glad that I'm onboard with it!",1,1751438902.0,diabetes_t2,0,1.0,False

1lpp0eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lpp0eh/my_new_office_job_is_really_weird/,My new office job is really weird.,"Hey, Reddit. I don’t post here much, and I honestly debated even putting this out there. But something weird is happening and I need to get it off my chest, or maybe just see if anyone else has gone through something similar.

I started a new job last week. Kind of. It's complicated.

I'm a 33-year-old father of two. I was working as Director of Operations for a company I won't name, but it was well-known, decently sized, and I was making good money. About a month ago, I got laid off out of nowhere. Budget restructuring, they said.

I was spiraling. Mortgage, kids, all that. I hadn’t even told my wife yet when I got a call from a private number. Guy on the other end sounded mid-40s, friendly, professional. Said he was sorry to hear about my situation — and then offered me a job.

I never gave out my resume. No idea how he got my number or knew I’d been let go.

I asked for details and he just said, “We like how you work. We’d like to see it in a different environment.” Vague as hell. But he gave me a meeting point: 9:00 AM sharp the next day. A pay phone downtown, a few blocks from where I live.

I know how this sounds. I know I should’ve just walked away. But I was desperate. And it was public, so I figured, worst case, I just don’t get in the car.

I showed up the next morning, dressed for an interview. A black SUV pulled up. Clean, expensive, windows tinted like a hearse. Guy in a suit opened the door for me without saying a word.

Somehow, he knew who I was.

I got in.

The man inside was all smiles. He greeted me like we were old colleagues, shook my hand, said, “You clean up well, Mr. Langston. Let’s get started.”

The drive was short — maybe ten minutes — and completely silent. We pulled into the lot of a plain, windowless building. Office-park kind of place, but no signage. Inside, the air smelled faintly like chlorine. Everything was white. Fluorescent lighting. Long, identical hallways.

He walked me down one flight of stairs, then through what felt like a dozen corridors. No windows, no clocks. Finally, we stopped at a door with a badge reader. He swiped a keycard, opened it, and stepped aside.

“This is your station.”

The room looked like a break room and an office had a baby. One desk, one computer, a filing cabinet, coffee machine, microwave. Weirdly sterile. No decorations.

On the desk was a monitor, already on. The screen read:

""Welcome, Candidate #345. We're glad you're back.""

That last part stuck with me. Back? I’d never been here before.

“So... what exactly do I do here?” I asked.

The man smiled politely, but before he could answer, his phone buzzed. He glanced at it and said, “One moment.” Then he stepped out of the room and shut the door.

That’s when it got weirder.

There was a photo on the wall. “Employee of the Month.”

It was me.

Same face, same haircut, even the same suit I was wearing. Smiling like I’d just won the lottery. The date under it was August 14, 2024. That’s next month.

I thought maybe this was some onboarding prank, or someone with a sense of humor. But the photo looked... real. A little too real.

Then I noticed a filing cabinet in the corner. I opened it. Inside were black binders labeled with simple numbers: 1, 2, 3, etc. I pulled out #3. Inside was a CD. No label.

The computer had a disk drive, so I slid it in and hit play.

It was me.

On the screen. Same room. Same clothes.

Same dead eyes.

I was sitting at the desk, staring at the camera. Then I started talking.

“Candidate #345. If you’re watching this, the test has restarted. That means you failed. Or the parameters changed.”
My voice was flat. No emotion. I didn’t even blink.

“Don’t trust the mirrors. They’re not calibrated right. And if you see your family — leave. That’s not them.”
The screen cut to static.

I sat there for a minute, just breathing.

Then I noticed a small envelope had been slipped under the door. I hadn’t heard anything. Inside was a Post-it note.

“The microwave is not a microwave.”

I turned and looked at it. Just a regular stainless-steel appliance. But when I stepped closer, I caught my reflection in the door. At first it looked normal, but then I noticed something:

My reflection was clenching its jaw. I wasn’t.

It blinked. I didn’t.

I backed away and went straight for the computer. A new folder had appeared on the desktop: Personal Feedback.

Inside was a document labeled Performance Review – Candidate #345. There were bullet points. Notes.

Subject showed confusion during entry. Normalized within 10 minutes.
Reacted emotionally to photo stimulus (wife).
Memory markers (“freckles,” “beach,” “shoulder birthmark”) triggered hesitation.
Mirror test: semi-successful.
I stared at the last line. Memory markers.

They knew about the birthmark on my wife’s shoulder. I hadn’t told anyone that. It's a tiny thing, but it’s one of the first things I noticed about her when we met. She hates it — thinks it looks like a smudge. I love it.

But here's the thing. The last time I saw her — I mean, really saw her — it wasn’t there.

Now I don’t know what’s happening.

I don’t know what this job is, or what I’m supposed to be doing. I haven’t left this room. There’s no clock. No phone signal. Every so often, I hear footsteps outside the door — but no one comes in.

And every time I check the wall, the Employee of the Month photo has changed. The smile’s different. The suit is darker. And today, she’s in the photo with me.

My wife.

She’s wearing a name tag. It says Observer_A.

I haven’t decided if I’m staying another day. I don’t know what happens if I try to leave. I don’t even know how long I’ve been here anymore.

But one last thing — and this is what really pushed me to post:

There’s a second folder on the desktop now.

It’s called “Candidates.”

It has hundreds of files. Each named with a number. I opened one at random — Candidate #344.

It’s a photo of a man slumped at the same desk I’m sitting at now.

He's not moving.

Under the image is a line of text:

“Incomplete Termination — Emotional Anchor Unresolved.”

Anyway, sorry this is so long. I don’t know if this is a black site, a psych experiment, corporate R&D, or something else entirely.

But if anyone out there knows what Candidate #345 means — or has ever been in a job where nothing seems real — please message me.

Because I can’t stop thinking about that photo.

1lpoz9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeensofKerala/comments/1lpoz9b/she_looked_at_me_in_the_mall_but_i_wasnt_ready/,She looked at me in the mall... but I wasn’t ready for what came next.,"So I went to a Mall just to see whether I’d get a girlfriend or not. Please Don’t laugh😅, people say malls are full of love stories waiting to happen. But in reality, there were only crowds and noise. And the girls? They were busy in their own world, walking around in groups, laughing, shopping, not even noticing anyone like me.

I didn’t have much money, so I bought a bottle of water and sat quietly near the Chickung restaurant, at one corner bench. Just sat there and watched people move on.

Then, a group of college girls came and sat on the bench next to mine. All in colour dress, loud and energetic. That moment... bro, goosebumps. I don’t know why, but it was a mix of fear and excitement. My heart was beating fast.

One of the girls kept looking at me. She was sitting half hidden behind her friend, so I couldn’t see her properly. Maybe she was shy.  But she was beautiful. 

I smiled at her. She looked down, and one of her friends whispered something while glancing at me. I couldn’t hear, but I noticed. Still, I stood up and walked to the counter to buy a coffee. I thought maybe... just maybe I could get one for her too.

On my way to the counter, I finally saw her full face. One side of her face was slightly burned like an old scar. For a moment, I felt heavy inside. But she... she didn’t look sad. She looked confident. 

Upon returning from the food counter, I went straight to her, handed her the coffee with a small smile. She took it slowly. I asked her name. She replied and I told my name as well. 
Her friends gave me those looks. But I didn’t care. Not at all. All I cared about in that moment... was her.

Not all love stories need flowers or winks. Sometimes, it’s just a simple coffee at Lulu Mall. ",20,1751438729.0,TeensofKerala,11,0.83,False
1lpoxi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1lpoxi6/the_trip_to_the_united_states_chapter_7_the_train/,"The Trip to the United States: Chapter 7- The train to Phoenix, AZ","*Beep. Beep. Beep.*

The insistent drone of the alarm cut through the pre-dawn stillness of the El Paso room at precisely 5:00 AM. Ela groaned, burying her face in the pillow. Beside her, Tanya slapped a hand vaguely in the direction of the noise until it fell silent. Both were bone-tired, the exhaustion of a trip already in motion settling deep in their muscles.

The rich, life-giving aroma of coffee soon drifted into the room, a silent summons from their host, Rosa. Downstairs, she stood by the stove, a warm and welcoming presence in her floral housecoat. She handed them each a steaming mug.

“Gracias, Rosa,” Ela murmured, cradling the warmth in her hands. She didn’t normally drink coffee, but the early hour and the long day ahead demanded an exception. She poured a generous amount of creamer into the dark liquid, mirroring Tanya.

Their suitcases stood by the door, packed and ready. Their train to Maricopa Station—a strange logistical quirk, as Amtrak inexplicably bypassed Phoenix—didn't leave until 10:00 AM, but Rosa was a believer in being prepared. She served them a hearty breakfast of huevos rancheros and handed them a bag filled with homemade burritos and bottles of water for the journey.

“You girls are going to love Arizona,” Rosa said, her smile genuine. She was a treasure, a living piece of El Paso’s history, embodying a kind of warm, unconditional hospitality that, she lamented, had started fading from the city around the turn of the millennium. “You must see the Grand Canyon, of course. And Saguaro National Park, right by Tucson, the cacti are like something from a movie. You can go to the old mining town of Globe, visit all the big shopping malls in Scottsdale, and ride the Valley Metro light rail. It’s very clean.”

“That all sounds amazing,” Ela said, a spark of genuine excitement cutting through her fatigue. Tanya nodded in agreement, her own eyes bright with anticipation.

With breakfast finished, Ela stepped outside onto the porch to call her mother. The air was already thick and heavy. “Mamá? Hola, soy yo.” She switched between English and Spanish seamlessly. “Sí, we’re leaving today… for Phoenix.”

There was a knowing sigh on the other end of the line. “I knew you weren’t going to last long in El Paso, mija.”

“It’s my health, Mamá,” Ela insisted, a hand resting on her chest. “I can’t breathe here. *El aire aquí es terrible.*”

Meanwhile, Tanya was on the phone with her parents. Her father’s worried voice was audible even from a few feet away. “Phoenix? Tanya, be careful. I’ve heard stories… kidnappings, human trafficking. You two young women alone…”

“Dad, we’ll be fine, I promise,” Tanya said, her voice a practiced calm. “We’ll stick together and be smart. It’s a big, modern city.”

Ela’s parents, in contrast, were unconcerned. Her mother had once had a layover at Sky Harbor Airport and recalled the experience with fondness. “I got good vibes from that airport,” she’d declared, which for her was as good as a thorough safety review.

Soon, the girls’ suitcases were loaded into Rosa’s van. She drove them through the quiet morning streets to the grand, historic Union Depot. After a heartfelt goodbye and promises to keep in touch, Ela and Tanya were on their own.

“Ooh, look at that cool elevator,” Ela said, pointing to it. They rode it up to the second-floor waiting area, a small, fun detour. They sat on the wooden benches, looking down at the tracks.

A soft chime echoed through the station, followed by a robotic voice announcing, “Amtrak Train Number 1, the Texas Eagle, now arriving. Providing service to… Deming, Tucson, Maricopa, and Los Angeles…”

“That’s us,” Tanya said, grabbing her carry-on.

“That jingle,” Ela remarked, “it sounds just like the one back home at Manchester Airport.”

Tanya listened for a moment. “You know what? It really does.”

The long, silver train glided to a stop. They boarded, found their coach seats, and settled in by a large window. As the train lurched forward, pulling away from the station, they watched El Paso shrink behind them. A little while later, they made their way to the cafe car, the gentle rocking of the train a constant rhythm beneath their feet. They ordered burgers, chips, and sodas, a classic American road trip meal on rails.

Back in their seats, with the vast, ochre-colored Chihuahuan Desert sliding past their window, the conversation turned serious.

“Tanya,” Ela began, her voice low. “I have to be honest. I hate where we live. I hate Stoke-on-Trent.” She said the name of their hometown as if it tasted foul. “I know I complain, but I’ve been thinking… I never want to go back to Stoke. I want to plan my escape from there.""

Tanya wasn’t surprised. She just listened. “What is it you hate so much?” she asked softly, then admitted, “I hate it too, you know.”

“It has no airport,” Ela listed, ticking the points off on her fingers. “There are no nice, fancy malls. The people… they’re just so rude and cold most of the time. The drivers are terrifyingly aggressive. And besides my family and you, I don’t feel like I have anything there.”

“The people are alright, some of them,” Tanya offered, “but definitely cold. And you’re right, the driving is scary. It gets so, so boring.”

Ela gestured out the window at the endless expanse of desert plains and distant mountains, painted in shades of brown, red, and purple under a brilliant blue sky. “Look,” she said, her voice filled with a quiet awe. “This is so much prettier than Stoke.”

Tanya couldn’t argue. It was a different world.

Just then, a tickle in Ela’s nose became a sudden, sharp sneeze.

“Bless you,” Tanya said automatically.

“Thank you.”

A few people in the seats around them began sniffing reflexively.

“Anyway,” Ela continued, pulling her phone out. “I want to work on my escape plan. I’ve been reading this blog, it’s called ‘NoStoke.’ It’s written by this guy who transplanted from Amsterdam, of all places, and he just tears the city apart. Every point he makes, I agree with.” She found the link and sent it to Tanya. “But what I really want to say is… I fell in love with Dallas-Fort Worth when we visited. I think… I kind of want to move there.”

Tanya’s jaw dropped. “Dallas? You want to leave *England*?”

“It would be nice to live in the United States, wouldn’t it?” Ela said, a dreamy look in her eyes. “I’ve been all over Europe and, honestly, it got old fast. This feels… new. Exciting.”

Tanya looked from Ela’s earnest face to the alien landscape outside. The idea, so huge and life-altering, settled not with a crash but with a quiet click. “If you moved,” she said slowly, “I think… I’d want to maybe try the US with you.”

A brilliant smile spread across Ela’s face. “Really? Maybe after Phoenix, we could check out Dallas? Just for a few days?”

“That would be lovely,” Tanya agreed. “The flights would have to be changed, though.”

“They can easily be changed,” Ela said dismissively, already tapping on her phone, pulling up images of the Dallas skyline and sprawling suburbs. “Look how nice it is.”

Tanya leaned over, and they looked together, two friends from a dreary English city, dreaming of a sun-drenched future as the train rattled across the desert.

The train slowed, pulling into the Tucson station for a brief stop. The Dallas conversation hung in the air, electric and full of possibility. To ground themselves, they started talking about fun memories from back home—nights out, silly inside jokes, the comfort of family Sunday roasts. It was a bittersweet journey down memory lane, acknowledging the good they would be leaving behind.

An hour or so later, the train began to slow for its final approach to their stop. “Next station stop, Maricopa! Maricopa Station is next!”

They gathered their bags and stood by the door. As the train hissed to a halt and the doors slid open, they were hit not by a wall of heat, but by a wave of dry, clean air. Ela stepped onto the platform and took a deep, deliberate breath. And then another.

A look of pure astonishment crossed her face. “Oh my,” she whispered, pressing a hand to her chest. “I can breathe so much better. The pain in my lungs… it’s gone. I don’t feel sick anymore.” She looked back in the direction of Texas. “I think El Paso is not a good city for me.”

“I agree,” Tanya said, taking her own deep breath of the clear desert air.

Their Uber arrived, a cool oasis from the afternoon sun. As it pulled away from the small station, leaving the tracks and the train behind, they were officially in the Valley of the Sun, on the cusp of a new adventure, with an even bigger one now simmering on the horizon.

*Coming up next, Ela and Tanya arrive at their Airbnb. Richard and Priscilla hosted them in Mesa. Their Phoenix adventures are fun. Stay tuned.*",1,1751438540.0,stories,0,1.0,False

I was diagnosed pre-diabetic back in late March. I had previously heard of intermittent fasting, and had seen youtube videos talking about its health benefits, but I never felt I needed to partake in it. Once I got this diagnosis, I decided to jump right into this lifestyle.



Starting Weight: 225 lbs, Starting Body Fat: 32%, **Starting HBA1C: 6.2%**



Here's all that I did:

1. Downloaded a calorie tracking app on my phone to aim for 150g protein, 150g carbs, and 115g fat (2235 total calories per day for fat loss)
2. Fasted 18:6 (Ate from 12:30p to 6:30p everyday)
3. Fasted weight training 4 days per week, and fasted cardio 2 days per week, all of which were done immediately before my first meal (Workout from 10:30ish am to 12pm)
4. Drink 1 cup black coffee with 1/4 tsp pink Himalayan salt before each workout or cardio session for energy (I've found that caffeine + electrolytes are the golden key for stamina while working out fasted!)
5. Prioritized protein, healthy fats, and hitting my calorie totals
6. Aim for 7 hours sleep per night minimum for good muscle recovery



I just did repeat bloodwork about a week ago (I've been doing intermittent fasting and fasted weight training for about 2 months now), and here are my results:



Current Weight: 220 lbs, Current Body Fat: 30%, **Current HBA1C: 5.9%**



Doctor said I'm doing a great job and that I should continue on track for even better results later this year. I feel damn proud of myself, and I definitely plan on continuing this lifestyle for the foreseeable future.

It wasn’t just fun or flirty, it felt real.

What was supposed to be a quick coffee date somehow turned into an entire day together from breakfast to dinner. He kept saying things like, “Let’s take our time,” or suggesting the next thing we could do, and it felt natural to keep going. We explored the city, talked deeply about our lives, laughed a lot, and I even brought him to a few of my favorite spots, places that are personal to me, and he seemed genuinely excited to experience them with me.

What made me feel safe and optimistic was how engaged and present he seemed throughout. He was asking me questions, complimenting me in sincere, specific ways (he said I was “genuinely intriguing”). He looked nervous at times, fidgety when he’d initiate physical closeness like holding my hand or leaning in, and honestly, I found it endearing. He even asked mid-date if I’d want to get dinner with him later that day despite having work and skipped his shift just so we could spend more time together.

He came back with me to my apartment and we made out, nothing more, and it felt genuinely affectionate.

He knew I was flying out of the city the next day (and I’m gonna be gone for quite long too) so I gently asked him if he’d want to stay in contact while I was gone. His response caught me off guard. He said, “For a first date, I don’t think I can do that. It feels like a lot of commitment” and followed it with something vague like “Maybe I’ll give you my number when you get back.”

That was the last time I heard from him. A few days later, I checked the app and realized he had unmatched me.

Now I’m left second-guessing everything. I really thought the date went well not just for me, but for us. He seemed into it, nervous in a sweet way, expressive, even bold. He skipped work to keep seeing me. He kept extending the time. He complimented me and made me feel like there was a genuine connection.

But now, I can’t tell what was the reason behind this. I think his response of “too much commitment” is valid because to be fair I was gonna be gone for 2 months. But also was it all just a soft way to get physical before I left the city? Did he say all those things just to get close? Did he actually enjoy the date but panic about emotional attachment? Or was this just some polite version of ghosting that still feels incredibly disposable? I don’t know the reason.

1lpot8k,https://i.redd.it/gjd3oe93deaf1.png,Just shipped our insights page at 2am and then Reddit told me B2C apps are basically lottery tickets,"So we just pushed our new insights feature live for FocaHQ. Been working on it for weeks, barely sleeping, living off cheap coffee powder, and this is not just for the insights feauture, but the whole time building Foca.

Anyways, I was feeling pretty good about ourselves. The AI analysis is actually solid, the UI is smooth as water, and early users are saying good things.

Then I hop on Reddit to look for inspiration for our next marketing post (this one x) and immediately see this thread: ""Don't build B2C apps unless you want to play the lottery""

# Emotional damage (that asian guy meme sfx - just imagine): critical hit

Nothing like browsing r/entrepreneur at 2:30am to completely destroy your dopamine high from shipping code.

The post was basically: B2C is a casino. Only about '0.000001%' consumer apps work out. Even good products fail because distribution is impossible. Just build boring B2B SaaS and make actual money.

And you know what? They're probably right.

Here I am grinding on a focus app when there's probably 500 other focus apps that died this year. Smart money says I should pivot to ""FocaHQ for Teams"" and start cold emailing HR managers.

Yes B2C is tough. Yes most consumer apps fail. Yes I could probably make more money selling productivity dashboards to middle managers.

But building something people actually use in their daily lives hits different than optimizing enterprise workflows. Also, to be actually honest, I'm not in the startup world to 'make money'. I could probably do that by borrowing a couple hundred thousand from my family and start flipping houses (yes my family is decent), but I wanted to change the world. I wanted to allow people to enjoy learning, and growing and developing as a person, with Foca ;)

Plus B2B means dealing with procurement processes and enterprise sales cycles and explaining why you need 47 security certifications just to help someone focus better. No thanks.

# The startup life is bipolar man

Literally 3 hours ago: ""We're gonna change how people think about productivity!""

Right now: ""Maybe I should just get a job at Google""

Tomorrow morning: ""Actually this insights page is fire, we're definitely onto something""

It's like emotional whiplash but with code and caffeine. One minute you're convinced you're building the next big thing, the next minute you're questioning every life choice that led you here.

# What I learned browsing that thread

* Everyone who succeeded in B2C says it's impossible
* Everyone who failed in B2C agrees it's impossible
* Everyone currently grinding B2C is in denial
* Everyone not doing B2C thinks we're all idiots

Probably all true tbh.

# Plot twist. Still gonna keep building

Yeah the odds suck. Yeah I could probably make more reliable money doing freelance or building boring B2B tools. Yeah this might be an expensive lesson in market reality.

But we've got users who actually care about what we're building. The insights page is legitimately useful. And honestly? Even if this fails, at least I'm failing doing something that might matter to people.

Worst case scenario I learn a bunch of stuff and have a cool portfolio project. Best case scenario we actually solve focus/productivity for a bunch of people and maybe make some money doing it.

# The real question

Is it better to build something you're passionate about with terrible odds, or something boring with better odds that slowly crushes your soul? I think that's why a lot of rich people get depression? Maybe? I'm no mental health expert.

Asking for a friend who definitely isn't having an existential crisis at 3am after reading too much startup advice on Reddit.

Anyway back to writing documentation for the insights feature because apparently that's my life now. If you made it this far thanks for listening to my TED talk about startup anxiety 🫠

I found her attractive, asked her number and after a week of texting, I asked her to get coffee and said “I would really like to get to know her better.” She replied enthusiastically but said she’s traveling for three weeks, unless I am free the next day for a quick coffee.

Since then we have been texting every few days with her letting me know how her trip is going and she is set to come back tomorrow.

She asked me over text what I would be up to for the 4th of July as our convo naturally headed in that direction. I told her to let me know if she’s looking for plans and that “it would be fun to celebrate with her” to which she told me “Yes that sounds fun! Let me figure out what’s happening tomorrow when I’m back and I can let you know when I’m free 😊”

I’m pretty sure she doesn’t see herself as a mentor, she’s never talked about her work to me, and we’re in different fields. But I still don’t know if she realizes I was trying to make a move, or if she just sees me as a friend.

So where does that leave me? She doesn’t seem like the type that would go for younger people as she seems so mature and innocent. Any ideas for what to do with her on the 4th?

1lporpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1lporpn/psycho_roommate/,Psycho Roommate,"I got myself into the absolute worst living experience of my whole life. I’ve had a number of roommates over the last 10 years, but nothing like this.

I want to vent. I’m open to advice. I’m doing everything to get out of this. But here’s my story —

I was living with my boyfriend and his brother for a few months, the goal was to save money because prior to that I was paying $1300+ a month living alone. It was not a good situation, turned the relationship into something toxic and uncomfy and I was desperate to have my own space again. So desperate to have some independence back and a clean girly space again. So desperate I did NOT properly vet my new roommate. I rushed into this situation, and it has become my biggest regret thus far.

5/7/25 we moved in together. It was only about a month prior we had met on one of those Facebook pages with people searching for roommates. We met up, she seemed nice, we vibed well. She was getting out of what seemed to be a terribly abusive relationship and at the moment living in her car. She said she’d already been approved for an apartment but that last girl that was supposed to move in with her bailed last minute, so she needed someone to agree to move in with her in about 2 weeks. 

I did. And that’s when all the red flags started appearing, but it was too late. I will say I’ve long been the naive type, who gives way too much sympathy and grace — and I see that now.

She was quick to tell me how her ex had raped and beaten her multiple times and she intended to take it to court. BUT THEN, has the same man in our apartment multiple times. She’d say things like “I asked him if I could come over and watch a movie and he said no, so guess who’s going to the magistrate. I have audio recordings of him raping me.”

The part of me that felt bad soon started to feel doubtful of the truth of her story, especially being a woman that believes 99% of women. 

She’d called her ex before that ex asking him to help craft a witness statement to the abuse she experienced from the newest guy — he responded that she needed to leave him alone and that he was getting a protective order on her and she’d be served. She said “oh if he’s not gonna help me I’m going to report him to the cops for selling drugs and he’ll go back to jail.” 

She’d shown me messages from her previous landlord demanding money because she’d not paid them rent AND they had to repaint all the walls, change all the carpets, and repair things from all the damage she caused. Totaling about 2k even after the security deposit. Which was concerning, but I don’t know the story. My roommate instead kept insisting that the landlord owed her the deposit back and that she’d be taking them to court.

Now those are just some stories about people she’s interacted with during the time I’ve known her and the bad feeling it gave me.
Additionally she’d shown me messages from both her own sister and grandmother refusing to let her stay with them during the time she was “homeless” and refusing to help her with the move.
Before I knew all the details, I felt for her. She said she’d been in foster care too. I felt like the world had been cruel to her and she needed a big sister figure and some guidance.

She was a bit much for awhile. Coming into my room and sitting on my floor to talk to me when I really wanted her to leave me alone. Butting in on my phone conversations or real conversations when I’d had a friend and my sister over. Always trying to be a part of things. Saying things like “I wish I had friends like you.” “I wish I had sisters like you.” I felt bad.

Two days of being moved in together she tells me she was fired from her job. I told her it gave my anxiety and to keep me updated on her job hunt. She flipped shit on me saying I was giving her anxiety not having all of my boxes unpacked yet. It made me nervous how defensive and easy to upset she was, but I just brushed it off.
Now with saying that I’d also like to say — moving in together, I had all of the furnishings from my previous apartment I’d lived in alone. Almost all brand new things and absolutely everything you’d need for an entire place. My couch, rugs, shelves, coffee table, entertainment center, TVs, pots & pans, dishes, small appliances, cleaning supplies — EVERYTHING IS MINE. That was fine with me, at first. And also yes, every box inside was mine… I own everything and I’ve brought it all to share. 

She also informed me the same night, 2 nights of being moved in together, that it was a good thing we’d got approved when we did because she WAS evicted from her last place but it hadn’t had time to appear on record.
Additionally, I had to open every utility in my name because she had a debt to dominion energy, va natural gas, and cox. As well as debt on her car preventing her from getting a parking pass.

I’ve always been in control of utilities and like ensuring things get paid on time and things are organized so I initially wasn’t bothered opening things in my name, but I found out about all the debts later. 

Flash forward to some crazy events —
1) one night I was out with my sister and invited her to stay over. We get home around 2 am and go into my room to change and get in bed. No music or loud conversations or anything wild. She busts into my room without permission yelling at me in front of my sister for having a stranger in the house without her permission, how this was completely unacceptable. I deescalated the situation. Told her I’d let her know next time if someone was gonna be in the home. Okay, whatever.

2) I invite her out one night with my friends. I’ll condense the story: my two friends leave to catch the ferry, roommate meets with some guy she talked to on bumble last year and noticed at the bar, and I go off to do my own thing. I run into an old friend from high school and the guy she’s with orders an uber for me and my roommate. I find my roommate, say it’s time to go home and neither of us are driving my car home now. She FREAKS OUT because I gave a stranger our address, not the apartment number. And it was in the uber app. But nonetheless it pissed her off. She calls MY friend back who had also been drinking to come give us a ride home. Which I also thought was dumb and unsafe. 
My friend comes back to give us a ride, we’re arguing the whole time. She insisted the bumble guy could’ve taken us home. I insisted the uber should’ve taken us home. Petty argument. 
We get to the complex and out of the car and she insists I cannot come in or she will beat my ass, she tries forcing my keys out of my hand, and does it successfully. Mind you she’s got at least 80 lbs on me, and I’m not a fighter. I leave with my friend, come back the next day, she left HER apt key in my car and I retrieved it and came in.

I try speaking to her about the night before and she just says things like “you’re lucky you’re not in the hospital, I only didn’t punch you in the face because you wear glasses and I didn’t want to cause permanent damage, you should be sorry” 
I said I’m not doing this and walk away. She runs up on me inches from my face telling me she doesn’t want to talk to me, doesn’t even want to look at me, and telling me I need to go to my room RIGHT NOW.
I was in utter disbelief. Take myself to my room, gather some things, and leave for the day.

3) Two days after the incident above. We’d not spoken since. I get home from work (I’m a server, sometimes not off til midnight), make some food, go to my room. I’m on the phone with my friend playing The NY Times spelling bee like we do every night. Approximately 2 am I get up to use the bathroom and get a glass of water and return to my room.
A moment later she’s knocking on my bedroom door. I say “yes?” She opens the door and starts yelling “IVE TOLD YOU TO STOP SLAMMING THE FUCKING DOORS, STOP SLAMMING THE DOORS” while slamming my door over and over again. I get up and quickly lock the door asking her please stop, please go away. This pisses her off more, she starts rattling the knob and beating my door with her fists. I’m still on the phone and my friend is like “what is going on over there?!” I just say “do you hear this?? It’s my roommate “
My roommate starts laughing and yelling evil things at me through the door, and says “oh yeah do you hear this?!?” And starts taking boxes of my things from the common space and throwing them at my door. 

At this point I hung up the call and started recording, I come out of my room yelling at her to stop touching my stuff, to get away from my door, get her hands of my property, etc. She uses her whole body to push my against the wall and raise her fist at me “WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?”
Phone in hand still I emergency dial 911, and she runs outside. 

Cops come. There’s no evidence she actually “harmed” me psychically, not enough to remove anyone from the home because we’re both on the lease and we’re not in a relationship.

In the following days I get an emergency protective order and then a preliminary protective order. 
I hadn’t planned to press any charges, I just wanted her away from me. 
BUT THEN, I get served papers for assaulting HER. Turns out you can go to the magistrate and say anything and have anyone served — who knew??? Not me. I’ve never done any of this before. Cops, court, charges, protective orders, allllll new to me. 
The cop who served me the papers sees my disbelief. When he came to my door I open it surprised, asking what exactly I’m being served for and saying “what??? She assaulted ME. I literally JUST got a protective order against her!”
I was advised to press charges myself, and so I did. 

It’s been almost a month since the cops were called the first time. A month with many cop visits, once having her escorted out of the home, once with her trying to have me escorted out though I have the no contact order.
A court date for my final protection order — which has been pushed a month out because I now have pending assault charges against me and that must be sorted through first so the evidence can reveal who the actual perpetrator is. And though I have a no contact order, we share the lease and are not in a relationship and thus the home cannot be granted to one of us. It is no contact aside from what is necessary when residing in a shared living space.

A month of absolute torment. 
The only things she owns in the apartment— the shower curtain and the silverware — she’s taken to her room. So now every shower the floor is covered in water, and yes I refuse to buy a new one.
I’ve listened to her gloating around the apartment to some friend on her phone about how she’s stuck my toothbrush up her ass. (Good thing it’s the decoy toothbrush I left in the shared bathroom).
She still uses all of my things, breaking my dishes and leaving them there. 
I’ve listened to her telling our maintenance man how I’m abusive and a liar and I’m going to be removed from the apartment soon.
She’s made numerous posts on the same public roommate pages searching for a roommate to replace me, the abusive alcoholic. Into her fully furnished apartment. People giving her sympathy and taking the bait — though the apartment isn’t yet available, is furnished only with my things, and she can’t just have me removed like she’s telling everyone.

She’s called the cops in an attempt to have me committed, saying I try to kill myself, threaten suicide everyday, etc. To which they told her there’s no evidence and there’s nothing they can do.
She’s claimed I’ve tried to kill her cats, I’ve harmed them etc. 
She’s claimed I’ve “harmed her property,” though she owns nothing in here. But placed a camera in the living area after I’d gotten a protective order, that I FOUND and unplugged for days until she was served a violation. 

She’s not paid the bills she owes me. As everything is in my name, connected to my cards. Not the electric, the WiFi, the rent. I’m still waiting.
I cut her off the WiFi, being the only thing I can actually cut off. And she just repeatedly resets the gateway because the only hookup is in the living room, so she gets access anyways. 

She piles trash and never takes it out, flooding the kitchen with bags and placing bags of trash on the patio in 90+ heat. Until I take them out because I can only tolerate so much. She’s left a bag of shit, literal shit outside of her bedroom door. I’m assuming it’s a bag from her cats litter box, but at this point who knows. And the shit smell is just permeating through the apartment.
She spits disgusting brown loogies into the shared bathroom sink, just leaving them crusting over and the drain catch unable to drain. 

She leaves heaps of dishes in the sink — my dishes actually. That I end up cleaning because again, I can only tolerate so much filth. 

I’m losing all of my hair, a literal bald spot spreading across the back of my head. My doctor says it stress induced alopecia. Never in my life had this problem.
My anxiety is disgusting, I barely sleep anymore. I never know what to expect from her and I’m genuinely afraid of her. 
I’m missing work for court dates. I make too much for a public defender. But I’m spending all of my money to maintain these bills, my own and also what we’re supposed to be paying together. I have no money for a lawyer and I’m stressing about that too. I don’t know how to operate in a court, but I’m sure not having a lawyer against someone who does doesn’t give me any advantage.

I’m anxiously waiting to get my final protective order, because only then can I have her legally removed from the lease and the apartment. And though I have evidence and witnesses to her behavior, I’m still nervous without a real lawyer. 
I’ve thought of every possible way out, even just abandoning the place and accepting an eviction and a debt. But that’s not reasonable. The leasing office has told me I could find a tenant to take over my spot on the lease — but how could I in good faith do that to anyone??? How could I make this seem like a good opportunity and a good place to live without lying about the terror that lives inside?

I hate being here everyday. I hate hearing her move around the apartment from inside my locked room. I hate her touching my things and I hate the idea of putting it all back into a storage unit just to keep her away from it. I hate leaving my cats here alone when I leave the apartment — I keep them closed in my room now always, and I feel awful for limiting their quality of life. I hate coming home everyday from work knowing what’s here. I get the most disgusting anxiety every time I enter. 
I sleep now with mace and a knife in my bedside drawer. I never come home without someone on the phone with me at least.

Now, she wanted to take her children too.But today was Rowena's birthday. Estela didn't want to ruin the celebration.She wiped away her tears and stepped into the room with a gift. Rowena, who loved looking pretty, pulled away the moment she reached to touch her head.""And Mommy, you have a cold. Stay away from me-don't mess up my hair. Phoebe did these braids. If they get messed up, she'll be upset.""Estela watched Rowena and her son Josh Leon excitedly talk about making clothes for Phoebe. In the corner, a little doll meant to be ""Mommy"" lay forgotten, tossed aside.Her chest tightened, and a bitter taste spread in her mouth.She had been in a secret marriage with Vance for three years. To everyone else, Phoebe was seen as his rightful wife.But after just a few months apart, even her own children-flesh and blood-now seemed to prefer another woman.Estela lowered her eyes and stood in silence for a long while, only heading upstairs to shower and rest when the housekeeper quietly reminded her.Just then, Vance's secretary arrived. He paused for a moment, surprised to see her.""Ma'am, Mr. Leon won't be coming home tonight. He asked me to pick up the gift he prepared for Ms. Silva,"" the secretary said.""Alright,"" Estela said softly.Once the secretary left, a sharp pain shot through her chest.He remembered to prepare a gift for Phoebe-but not once had he ever given her anything.She dialed a video call.It connected quickly.""What is it?""The screen showed Vance's private lounge.Elegant, luxurious, bathed in dazzling light-every inch oozed the extravagance that Zrefast was known for.He wore a six-figure tailored suit, held a wine glass, and lounged casually on the sofa.There was nothing calculating about him-just cool elegance. His expression was calm, aloof, and untouchable, like frost or snow. He was the kind of man people dreamed of but could never reach.Estela had loved him for six whole years.Her voice softened. ""It's been a while since we saw each other. Tonight, maybe-""""Vance-""Before she could finish, a soft, feminine voice chimed in on his end.It was Phoebe.The call cut off immediately.Just before the screen went black, Vance said simply, ""We'll talk later.""Estela tightened her grip on the phone, staring out at the towering skyline beyond the window.Cars streamed through the streets like rivers of light. The city shimmered-so bright and beautiful it almost didn't seem real.Her husband, Vance, controlled a financial empire and moved markets with ease. But for her-his wife-he had no warmth, no time, no care.Six years, and he'd never changed. Always cold. Always distant.Behind every kind word or gentle look was a wall she could never get past.She'd spent all these years trying to win back his heart.But in that moment, for the very first time-Estela felt something shift. She was tired.Estela didn't call him back. She drifted into a restless, heavy sleep.The next day, Vance finally sent a message: \[Sorry. Happy third anniversary.\]Then another: \[This is to make up for it.\]Not long after, a bank alert came through-an eight-figure deposit.She scrolled past the messages, just as a notification popped up from Phoebe's social media.\[A custom-made diamond ring from Egoset-eight months in the making. A once-in-a-lifetime piece. Thank you, Mr. Leon.\]In the post, Phoebe was all smiles, radiant and charming. A dazzling diamond sparkled on her pale, delicate hand.Dressed in a rose-red gown, she posed beneath a famous tower, the fabric swirling around her like wine. The whole image screamed luxury, decadence-and intention.Estela suddenly remembered the day before she married Vance.It was in the family's quiet, old estate. He'd walked past her along the corridor. His eyes were calm, unreadable-but they had seen straight through her illusions.He said, ""I'll marry you. But that's all.""Back then, she'd thought the line ""I want love, not money"" sounded childish-naive, even.But now, for the first time, she got it.For six years, she'd chased a fantasy-thinking all she wanted was his love.And she'd never had it.She forced down the emotions building inside her and quietly went downstairs.In the garden, she heard Rowena's innocent, sing-song voice, laced with a hint of complaint. ""Why did Mommy come back? Phoebe promised to take us to see the bear ballet today. I wish Mommy just never came back.""Chapter 2""Yeah,"" Josh said softly, eyes downcast. ""Billy said Daddy only married Mommy because he couldn't marry Phoebe. Mommy's pretty, but I still like Phoebe more.""The words hit Estela like ice water down her spine-sharp, sudden, cruel.'He couldn't marry her?' she thought.The shock took a moment to fade, and when it did, her heart felt hollow.She looked at her children.She'd nearly died giving birth to them-both times. Complications, hemorrhaging.They'd been weak, sickly babies, and she'd cared for them around the clock. Barely slept, barely ate. It ruined her health.Then something happened in Zrefast. Vance's father Reggie Leon fell gravely ill.Vance went back to take charge-and brought the kids with him.Since then, she'd been traveling back and forth between two cities. But every time she came back, the children seemed farther and farther away.She didn't even remember how she got back to her room.The kids had private lessons scheduled. The nanny took them out.Even with everything on her plate, Estela messaged Vance again to ask for a meeting.She was his wife. Whether it was about the kids or about Phoebe, she had every right to demand answers.But he brushed her off with a single line. ""I have something important. Let's talk tomorrow night.""There was no way to describe the bitterness welling up inside her.She left the house without thinking and wandered to the place where she and Vance had first met-an old amusement park.It was small, tucked away in a corner of the city.Just as she stepped in and approached the Ferris wheel, she heard a familiar little voice. ""Phoebe, I want to ride the Ferris wheel!""""Okay, I'll go get the tickets.""Estela looked up-and there they were.Not far away, Phoebe and Vance, each holding one of her children's hands. They looked, unmistakably, like a perfect family.Soon, Estela heard her children's voices. ""You're the best. I want to be with you forever.""Phoebe laughed softly, teasing, ""If your mom hears that, she won't be happy.""""I don't like her. Why should I care if she's mad?""The words hit Estela like a blast of arctic wind.She stood frozen, watching in silence as Vance and her children walked hand in hand with Phoebe into the Ferris wheel.The man she had loved for six years. The children she had brought into the world.Without another moment's hesitation, Estela turned and walked away.She'd been holding on for six years-it was time to let go.Back at the old house, she quietly packed up all of her belongings.Then she sent Vance one final message: \[Have the divorce papers ready.\]She left her wedding ring on the nightstand, walked out without a backward glance, and called a cab to the airport.\*\*\*\*\*After leaving the church, Vance returned to the old house with the children.The area outside the church was packed. Just as he was about to check his phone, someone shouted-""Stop! Thief!""A commotion erupted.The bodyguards instinctively moved to shield him, but in the chaos, Phoebe was shoved forward-right into Vance's arms.His phone slipped from his hand, crashed to the ground, and was crushed under the stampede of feet.""Vance, I'm so sorry-your phone."" she said.He frowned briefly, then said calmly, ""It's fine. I'll get another one.""The phone was mostly used to keep in touch with family anyway.Not that anyone in the Leon family texted much. If anyone messaged him at all, it was usually Estela.But her messages had never seemed urgent.\*\*\*\*\*On the way home, the kids were buzzing with excitement.Rowena tugged on his sleeve, eyes sparkling. ""Daddy, is Phoebe really going to stay with us soon? She promised to take me to Candyland!""Even Josh looked hopeful.""Yes,"" Vance nodded.But Josh hesitated, frowning slightly. ""But Daddy. Mommy said we're not very healthy, and the air at Candyland might make us sick. She didn't want us to go. Won't Mommy be upset if she finds out Phoebe's moving in?""Vance responded gently, ""Phoebe is trained in medicine. She once saved Daddy's life. With her here, you'll both be fine. Your mommy won't be staying long anyway. Phoebe's just visiting for a while to help take care of you.""The kids had always been frail. Having Phoebe around might actually do them some good.""Yay!"" They both shouted in delight as they arrived home.But the moment they stepped inside, they found something that made them even happier-Estela had gone back to Trurgh.Vance noticed the wedding ring placed neatly on the nightstand and paused, mildly surprised.Ever since they got married, no matter how badly they fought, Estela had never taken off that ring.Chapter 3Now she had left without a word-and taken the ring off, too.'Is she upset again? Feeling neglected?' he thought.Estela had always been gentle and soft-spoken-like most women from Trurgh, traditional and reserved. No matter how coldly he treated her, she never pushed back.'Well, even the calmest person has a breaking point,' he thought.Still, Vance didn't take it too seriously.He tossed the ring aside without a second thought.""Mrs. Leon won't be coming back for a while. Pack up her things. Clean out the room-Ms. Silva will be moving in soon,"" he ordered.Rowena and Josh's eyes instantly lit up.'Now that Mom is gone, Phoebe can finally move in,' they thought.'And no one would be breathing down our necks anymore-asking the doctors endless questions about our physical activity.''Mom always makes such a big deal out of everything. She insists we meet our monthly exercise quotas and hovers over us every time she comes home.'""It's just a pity,"" Josh muttered gloomily. ""Mom said she'd help us finish building that spaceship. It's super hard.""The puzzle had thousands of tiny pieces. Once completed, it would become an intricate model of a spaceship. Josh had been planning to give it to Phoebe as a birthday gift.But it was exhausting and hard on the eyes-he'd been waiting for Estela to help.Rowena pouted too. ""She was supposed to finish sewing clothes for my doll before she left.""Every time Estela came back, she'd make a whole new wardrobe for the dolls. Phoebe always said how good Estela was at picking fabrics and matching colors.But this time, Estela left so suddenly that the clothes weren't ready.Now Phoebe wouldn't see them, and there'd be no compliments.Estela wasn't as fun or glamorous as Phoebe, but when it came to fiddly little projects like this-she was actually really good.\*\*\*\*\*Meanwhile, in Trurgh-miles away-Estela returned to the home she once shared with Vance.After he moved back to Zrefast with the kids, Estela had stayed behind. Officially, it was for work, but in truth, it was mostly to care for his parents.Reggie had long settled in Zrefast, but the rest of the family had moved to Trurgh over a decade ago.High society in Zrefast had its own rigid rules-everything from dress codes to dinner etiquette was micromanaged.Rosalyn Leon never got along with Reggie and had no interest in returning to that life. She was used to being pampered and calling the shots-and preferred life in Trurgh, where things went her way.The Leon family wasn't fond of women who were too outspoken or ambitious, so for Vance's sake, Estela had kept a low profile and stayed behind as the dutiful daughter-in-law.Her job at Leon Group had always been in name only.But now that she had made up her mind to divorce Vance, none of that mattered anymore.She packed up everything in their marital home and prepared to hand over the keys.Just as she came downstairs, suitcase in hand, the butler happened to see her.""Mrs. Leon, you're back. Rosalyn mentioned she was craving that fish soup you made last time.""But when he saw the luggage, he froze mid-sentence.Estela handed him the house keys.""I won't be living here anymore,"" she said with a faint smile. ""If she wants soup, tell her to hire a chef.""Without waiting for a response, Estela turned and walked out-ignoring the butler's stunned expression.That night, Rosalyn didn't get her fish soup.\*\*\*\*\*Later that evening, Vance video-called Rosalyn. She didn't waste time voicing her discontent.""Honestly, you never should've married a woman from Trurgh. Can't even cook a simple dish of fish soup,"" she said.He looked mildly surprised.Estela had always been respectful and compliant, especially toward elders. Her defiance this time? Unexpected.""It's just a dish,"" he said indifferently. ""If she won't make it, get someone else who will.""Rosalyn looked uncomfortable.Truth be told, she'd already tried hiring several chefs-but none of them could get it quite right. Not like Estela did.Still, she couldn't admit that in front of her son. She muttered a vague reply and left it at that.Off to the side, the butler hesitated, unsure whether to say anything about Estela moving out of the house.""Mr. Leon. Mrs. Leon, she. she's moved out.""He barely got the words out before Vance cut him off, voice cold and flat. ""Forget it. Leave her alone.""Vance ended the call without a second thought.Through the floor-to-ceiling windows of his office overlooking Zrefast, a faint trace of annoyance flickered across his otherwise impeccable face.He glanced at his newly replaced phone, but in the end, didn't call the contact at the top of his list.Chapter 4Back at the church, both his phone and SIM card had been destroyed.At first, he'd intended to let Estela know-she was still his wife, after all.But lately, it seemed all the special treatment he'd given her over the years had gone to her head.A little lesson wouldn't hurt.Unaware of any of this, Estela slept soundly through the night.The next morning, she returned to the Leon Group and submitted her resignation.It went through without a hitch.When Vance had placed her in the company, it was a low-level, nominal role. No one really knew her true identity.So once she completed her handover, she could leave cleanly.When word got out, a coworker remarked with a knowing smile, ""Must be for your kids, huh? They're what, four? Five? That age clings to their mom like glue. You always had their pictures on your desk-and that necklace with their little faces on it. You've always treated them like treasures.""Estela paused.She had loved Vance-deeply. And naturally, she loved the two children they had together. Even now, separated by cities, she still cared deeply for Rowena and Josh.But.She shook her head, offering a small smile. ""It's not about them.""And that was the truth.The Leon Group was massive and well-connected internationally, but its focus-construction and real estate-was never her passion.Before, as Vance's wife, she hadn't questioned it. The expectations from the Leon family left little room for her own ambitions.But now that she had chosen to leave him, she needed to choose her own future.Her gaze drifted to her phone, where a headline flashed across the screen. \[National Heritage Expo: The Fragrant Arts.\]Perfume blending. Coffee ceremony. Modern reinterpretations of traditional craftsmanship.Something about it caught her eye.Without hesitation, she texted her cousin, Wilford Warren: \[Any chance you can get me a ticket to this event?\]He responded almost instantly. \[Of course. But aren't you always too busy? Between the Leon family and the kids, when do you ever have time for this kind of thing?\]\[I do now.\] Estela replied calmly. \[I'm divorced.\]There was a pause.\[Wait-seriously?\] Wilford's response came with a stunned breath. \[You actually divorced into that Leon family?\]The same Leon family who had built a private rooftop amusement park in the heart of Zrefast-just for their grandchildren. No outsiders allowed.Back when Estela's parents died, the only reason the Leon family even considered the marriage was because her grandfather Keven Warren had once done them a great favor.Otherwise, no way would they have let Vance marry the daughter of a university professor.Even if that professor's father was none other than Keven-the renowned scholar of classical arts.\[If it doesn't feel right, walk away.\] Estela replied lightly, with a smile.Wilford couldn't tell if he admired her courage or pitied her choices. Maybe a bit of both.Wilford: \[But... what about Rowena and Josh? Can you really let them go?\]Estela glanced at her phone.When the kids had moved back to Zrefast, she'd made sure they each had a phone-just in case they missed her and wanted to call.But over the past year, unless she reached out first, neither of them had ever called her.They had everything now: a powerful family name, a life of privilege. and a woman they already saw as their mother.'So why should I keep clinging to a connection that only exists in blood?' she wondered.\*\*\*\*\*Back in Zrefast, inside the Leon family's estate, the nutritionist gently reminded the children, ""Josh, Rowena, did you forget what Ms. Warren said? No being picky with food. Your bodies are still fragile-you need a balanced intake of fat to grow up healthy. And no overdoing it with sweets.""Josh hesitated, looking uncertain.But Rowena waved it off like it was nothing.""Mom already missed her check-in call! She won't know anything. Besides, Phoebe said kids should be happy! And right now, the thing that makes me happiest is eating all these cupcakes!""Just then, a light laugh floated down from upstairs.Phoebe came down, smiling as she walked over and gently tapped Rowena on the forehead. ""You little troublemaker. Alright-whatever Rowena and Josh want, they can have.""""Yay! Phoebe, you're the best! I wish you could stay with us forever!""Their innocent cheers made Phoebe's smile deepen.The nutritionist frowned. She opened her mouth to object, but when her gaze landed on Phoebe, she hesitated-and fell silent.At first, she had assumed Estela was the lady of the house. But now it was clear: Phoebe moved around the Leon family like she belonged. The kids were clearly attached to her.If she upset Phoebe, it might not sit well with Vance.Josh, meanwhile, was conflicted.Chapter 5Last time he ignored Estela's advice, he ended up really sick.Phoebe was sweet, and he did like her-but Estela had warned him that if he kept eating recklessly, he'd get seriously ill again, and Vance would be worried too.He didn't want to cause either of them stress. So as he ate, he held back, choosing more carefully.Rowena, however, wasn't as cautious. She ate too much-mixing cold and hot foods, creamy desserts, and sugary treats. By nightfall, she was doubled over in pain.Curled up on her bed, she trembled from the stomach cramps. Her soft, pale face looked pitiful, flushed and tear-streaked.When Vance heard Rowena wasn't feeling well, he rushed home immediately.Rowena tugged on his sleeve with teary eyes and a trembling voice.""Daddy. did I get sick because I was bad? Did Mommy punish me with a stomachache? She said if I ate too many cupcakes again, a witch would curse me. I didn't mean to. I want Mommy to come back and undo the spell."" she said.More than anything, she missed how Estela would always make her warm soup whenever she was feeling sick.Now, all she could do was cry, a mess of tears and runny nose.Beside them, Phoebe bit her lip, looking guilty. ""Vance, I'm so sorry. I wasn't paying close enough attention. I let Rowena eat too many sweets.""Rowena quickly jumped to her defense, worried her father might be upset with Phoebe. ""Daddy, it's not her fault! It's because Mommy forgot to call me! She doesn't care about me anymore.""Josh blinked in confusion. Thankfully, he'd remembered what Estela said last time he got sick.Even if Estela didn't laugh and play like Phoebe, she always paid close attention when it came to their health.Still, since Phoebe was always so kind, he couldn't help but speak up for her too.""Daddy. Mommy used to remind us a lot. Rowena's still little-she just forgets things sometimes.""""Understood,"" Vance said, his tone a bit firmer now. ""From now on, both of you need to follow the nutritionist's instructions. No more sneaking snacks.""He didn't blame Phoebe for what happened. In fact, he found himself even more frustrated with Estela.'Isn't this exactly what she is supposed to be doing? She used to handle all of Rowena's meals and routines,' he thought.But now that she couldn't even be bothered to check in properly, Rowena had gotten sick. As far as he saw it, this was on her.Estela had no idea Rowena had been sick.That Sunday, she still thought to check in and called the kids over video chat.She was their mother, after all. Even if the emotional bond wasn't what it used to be, she still had a duty to them.When the call came through, Rowena and Josh were busy helping Phoebe try on evening gowns.In just a few days, Reggie would be discharged from the hospital.Normally, that would mean Vance had no reason to stay in Zrefast and would head back to Trurgh to continue expanding the business.But the idea of returning made the twins visibly glum.They weren't ready to see Estela again. And they definitely didn't want to leave Phoebe.Seeing their downcast faces, Phoebe smiled and gently ruffled their hair. ""Hmm. let me guess. Why are my little prince and princess so upset?""She paused dramatically. ""Is it because we're heading back to Trurgh? I thought you'd be excited to see your mom again.""Rowena's eyes welled with tears. She pouted and mumbled, ""What's so great about seeing Mom? We don't want to leave you.""Josh nodded. He did miss Estela a little, but the thought of parting with Phoebe made him hesitate.""Well then,"" Phoebe said with a playful glint in her eye, ""I have some good news.""She let the suspense hang for a second, then smiled.""I've got work to do in Trurgh. I'll be staying there for quite a while-so I'll be coming with you!""""Really?"" Rowena lit up, cheering with joy. If Phoebe was coming to Trurgh too, then everything would be perfect.Right at that moment, Estela's video call came through.The ringtone echoed a few times. Rowena stared at the screen, then deliberately let it ring out before hanging up.Estela called again. And again.Annoyed, Rowena finally blocked the number.Phoebe chuckled and gave her a gentle poke on the forehead but didn't scold her. ""Rowena, why didn't you answer your mom's call?""""She didn't call me the other day on purpose, and I got sick. She's so mean-I don't want to talk to her!"" Rowena pouted.Besides, they'd be going back to Trurgh soon. She'd see Estela then anyway.And if Estela found out Phoebe was moving in, she'd definitely be upset.Chapter 6Rowena didn't want anyone messing with her and Phoebe's time together.Phoebe pinched her cheek with a warm smile. ""As long as our little princess is happy, that's all that matters.""Josh had a fleeting sense that something about all this wasn't quite right. But when he saw the calm expression on Phoebe's face, his doubt faded.Vance always said Phoebe was special-not like other women.And if she didn't think Rowena had done anything wrong, then maybe it really wasn't a big deal.Besides, they'd be seeing Estela again soon anyway.On the other end of the line, Estela stared at the red exclamation mark on her phone screen, stunned.This was a phone she had specially set up just for the twins.No one else used it. No one else had access.She'd known their relationship had grown distant since they'd gone to Zrefast-but she never imagined they would block her.Still worried, she called the housekeeper at the villa, the one in charge of the children's daily care.""Ma'am, the children are doing great,"" the woman said cheerfully. ""Right now they're helping Ms. Silva try on dresses.""The mention of ""Ms. Silva"" hit Estela like a pin to the chest.Those were her children-children she had nearly died bringing into this world.And now, they were looking to another woman for comfort and care.""As long as they're okay,"" she replied quietly.She didn't bring up the fact that her children had blocked her.She knew their personalities-spoiled since birth, prone to sulking. Blocking her was just another form of acting out.If this had happened before, she might have kept calling. Again and again. Refusing to give up.But now. she found she no longer had the energy.As long as they were safe and healthy, that was enough.Whether or not they still saw her as their mother-that was no longer something she could control.Two days later, Reggie was discharged from the hospital.Vance soon made the decision to return to Trurgh and expand the Leon Group's presence there.Before leaving, Rowena and Josh said their goodbyes to classmates at school.The farewell gifts were chosen by Phoebe.But the kids who received them didn't seem all that thrilled.""Barbies and toy cars? These are kinda old now,"" one of their closest friends muttered. ""I liked those teddy bear cakes your mom made way better. Why didn't you bring those?""Rowena pressed her lips together.Those teddy bear cakes were Estela's specialty. They were complicated to make-Estela had burned her hands several times trying to get them just right.But Phoebe didn't know how to make them. 'If only Mom were here.' Rowena thought.Josh looked down too.Ever since Rowena had blocked Estela's number, she hadn't called them once.He hadn't heard her voice in what felt like forever-and honestly, he kind of missed her.Still, he'd be seeing her soon.But if Estela was back, that probably meant less time with Phoebe.Vance had no idea what the kids were thinking.When the housekeeper called to inform him, she said, ""Sir, Mrs. Leon hasn't been back to the villa for over a week. Would you like us to let her know you're returning?""He frowned. His tone cooled immediately. ""No need. If she's not coming back, then clear out the master bedroom. I'll be moving in there with Rowena, Josh, and Phoebe.""In the past, he'd only stayed in the marital home when visiting the children.But since Estela insisted on giving him the cold shoulder, she had no business returning to that house.Meanwhile, back in Trurgh, Estela had moved into her old apartment and started growing flowers on the balcony.She wasn't particularly skilled at gardening, but maybe it was the peace of being on her own-or simply being free from her marriage-that made everything feel lighter.Her neighbor, Cleveland, was quick to scold whenever he saw her plants. ""Girl, if you don't know how to grow flowers, stop drowning them! They're about to keel over!"" he'd grumble, beard twitching with annoyance.After stepping in to rescue the plants himself, another neighbor pulled Estela aside, smiling apologetically.""Don't mind the old man-he's been extra cranky lately. Word is his grandson's refusing to get married, and they had a big falling out. He stormed off and moved in here to cool down.""Estela just smiled.The Leon family had been steeped in strict rules and formality. She'd spent years tiptoeing around, doing everything to please them.Cleveland might be grumpy and old-fashioned, but with his help, gardening suddenly felt more manageable.Over time, the two formed an unexpected friendship, one that felt strangely comforting.That evening, Estela got a message from Delia Allison, her senior from university.Chapter 7When Delia learned Estela would be attending the National Heritage Expo, she immediately suggested they go together.Estela had studied design in college-sharp, creative, and full of fresh ideas. She had once joined Delia's design studio under the pseudonym Smile, contributing to several dazzling, standout projects.But after marrying into the Leon family, she'd quietly stepped away.Delia's studio, meanwhile, had steadily risen to prominence. It was no surprise she'd been invited to such a major industry event.When Estela arrived, Delia was already surrounded by admirers, navigating the room like a star.In recent years, she'd made quite a name for herself, with a strong presence in the design world.People gravitated toward her effortlessly, eager to introduce themselves, eager to be seen.A successful woman always shone brightest-men, in contrast, felt more like props in the background.Estela watched from a distance and lowered her gaze.For years, she had poured her heart into Vance and their children-so much so, she had nearly forgotten who she used to be.'Could I still be that bold, brilliant designer I once was?' she wondered.Just as the thought surfaced, Delia made her way over.""This year's expo is really something. A lot of new talent showing up,"" she said with a knowing smile. ""Watching them today reminded me of you. Back when I tried to keep you at Allison Group-it's a shame how things turned out.""Allison Group had been the name of Delia's college startup-the predecessor to her current firm.Estela gave a small, bittersweet smile. ""Allison Group's doing just fine without me.""In the world of design, fresh talent emerged constantly. No one could stay on top forever.Besides, she hadn't been part of that world for years.""I don't agree,"" Delia said, lighting a cigarette and finally saying what she'd been holding in all these years.Estela looked up when she heard the words, her long lashes fluttering slightly as she gazed at the artwork on display.Delia raised an eyebrow. ""The Rangel Group has been focused on developing a modern aesthetic these past couple of years - from jewelry to fashion. That just happens to be your area of expertise. Estela, I need you.""Estela was no stranger to the Rangel Group.In recent years, it had expanded rapidly, especially in traditional industries.Its head, Wesley Rangel, though young, had already earned a reputation for being ruthless and calculating, with a sharp eye for the future.It didn't surprise Estela that Delia was trying to team up with the Rangel Group to carve out a space in the design market.'But... could I really go back to that world?' she wondered.Just as the thought crossed her mind, a cold, aloof voice called out from nearby. ""Estela? Shouldn't you be taking care of Mom? What are you doing here?""It was Thelma Leon- Vance's younger sister, and a star student at Choross University.Ever since Estela married into the Leon family, Thelma had kept her at arm's length.She had nothing but disdain for women like Estela - women who relied on men, buried themselves in housework, and, in her eyes, had no real worth.Estela hadn't expected to run into her here.She didn't offer much explanation. ""Just came to take a look.""""These pieces have significant artistic value,"" Thelma said coolly. ""Even the simplest design here is probably beyond your understanding. My brother, Josh and Rowena will be back soon. You'd be better off focusing on them.""To her, Estela was nothing special. Sure, she'd heard that Estela had a decent education and some design talent before marrying in, but in the end, she was just another woman who landed on her feet by marrying well. 'What real ability could she possibly have?' she wondered.Estela stood frozen for a moment. 'Vance is coming back?' she thought.Her fingers curled slightly, a trace of bitterness rising in her chest.Even though they were getting divorced, he was returning with the child - and he hadn't even bothered to tell her.In his eyes, the woman who had once been Mrs. Leon really didn't matter at all.Thelma, never one for small talk with Estela, was about to leave when something crossed her mind - the fish soup Rosalyn had been craving.""Oh, right,"" she said offhandedly. ""If you've got time, make some of that fish soup. You're not exactly busy, and your cooking's still passable.""In the past, Estela would've agreed without a second thought.Back then, she'd done everything she could to win the Leon family's approval.

## Key Features Analysis

The current generation of slayer shorts boasts a variety of innovative features designed to enhance performance and comfort. These include advanced moisture-wicking fabrics, ergonomic designs, and durable construction. This ensures that whether you're hitting the gym, running errands, or simply relaxing at home, yoru slayer shorts deliver optimal performance and comfort.

**Moisture-Wicking Technology:** this is perhaps the most crucial feature of any good slayer short.

Advanced moisture-wicking fabrics, typically composed of polyester, nylon, or a blend of both, play a pivotal role in keeping the wearer dry and comfortable, even during intense physical activity. These fabrics are engineered to draw sweat away from the skin's surface and transport it to the outer layer of the material, where it can quickly evaporate. This process helps regulate body temperature and prevents the build-up of moisture, which can lead to discomfort, chafing, and decreased performance. The effectiveness of moisture-wicking technology is frequently enough measured by its breathability, which is persistent by the fabric's ability to allow air to circulate and facilitate the evaporation of moisture. High-quality slayer shorts typically feature fabrics with excellent breathability ratings, ensuring optimal comfort and performance.

**Four-Way Stretch Fabric:** Freedom of movement is critical in athletic wear.

Four-way stretch fabric refers to a blend of materials, usually containing spandex or elastane, that allows the fabric to stretch and recover in both the warp (lengthwise) and weft (crosswise) directions. This unique property enables the shorts to move seamlessly with the body, providing unrestricted freedom of movement during a wide range of activities.Whether you're squatting, lunging, running, or jumping, the four-way stretch fabric adapts to your movements, minimizing resistance and maximizing comfort. The stretchability of the fabric also contributes to its overall durability, as it can withstand repeated stretching without losing its shape or integrity. This is particularly significant for slayer shorts that are subjected to frequent and intense use.

Durable construction and materials are essential for slayer shorts that are designed to withstand frequent and intense use. High-quality materials, such as reinforced stitching, and robust fabrics, are used to increase the shorts’ resistance to wear and tear. Reinforced stitching is crucial in high-stress areas, such as the seams and waistband, to prevent tearing and unraveling. Durable fabrics, such as ripstop nylon and abrasion-resistant polyester blends, are resistant to damage from friction and impact. These materials are carefully selected and combined to create slayer shorts that can withstand the rigors of daily wear and athletic activity, ensuring long-lasting performance and value.

**Multiple Pockets:** Practicality matters.

The integration of multiple pockets into slayer shorts offers added convenience and functionality. These pockets provide secure storage for essential items such as keys, phones, wallets, and energy gels. Strategically placed pockets,such as zippered side pockets and inner stash pockets,keep your belongings safe and accessible without interfering with your movement.The size, shape, and location of the pockets are carefully considered to maximize their usability and minimize any discomfort or obstruction during activity. Some slayer shorts even feature water-resistant pockets to protect your valuables from moisture.

1lponet,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesForMyTherapist/comments/1lponet/theres_a_classic_math_joke_that_a_topologist_cant/,“There's a classic math joke that a topologist can't tell the difference between a doughnut and a coffee cup: they both have one hole.,"Topologists classify holes based on their dimension. A closed loop, like the numeral 0, has a one-dimensional hole because it is formed by gluing together the ends of a one-dimensional line. Starting with a two-dimensional plane, like a sheet of paper, and taping up the edges will yield something like a hollow ball, which has a two-dimensional hole.

Higher-dimensional shapes can have higher-dimensional holes. By analogy with the one- and two-dimensional holes, for example, a three-dimensional hole is formed by “closing up” a three-dimensional space, like a cube. But this process can be seen only from a four-dimensional perspective, outside of most people's—likely anyone's—reach.

Some shapes have multiple holes of different dimensions, such as an inflatable ball with an attached handle that a child sits and bounces on. The hollow center of the ball is a two-dimensional hole, whereas the solid handle forms a one-dimensional hole. Topology has many precise methods to count holes in higher-dimensional shapes—an ability that turns out to be helpful in studying the brain's neuronal activity.

Neuroscientist Olaf Sporns of Indiana University thinks of the brain as a massive transportation network. The roads and infrastructure are built from the neurons and their connecting synapses. The brain's electrical and chemical signals drive along these streets. “The physical roads constrain the traffic patterns that you can observe dynamically on top,” Sporns says. The traffic patterns change as we move and think.

As we squint at a diagram of the brain, it might look like a collection of points, representing neurons. Some of them are connected by lines, indicating a synapse between those particular neurons. Mathematicians refer to this structure as a graph: a collection of nodes connected by edges. The graph flattens the biological complexity of the brain, but it retains the overall shape of the circuits. Such a trade-off is typical when creating a mathematical model, which weighs simplicity and analyzability against usefulness.

The graph of neuronal connections is a weblike mess: neurons are abundant and richly interwoven. In 2017 Kathryn Hess, a mathematician at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, tackled this complication by doing something that is initially surprising: she made the graph more complicated. She analyzed data from the Blue Brain Project, a massive computer simulation of the activity of a rodent neocortex, a part of the brain involved in higher-order functioning. The computer model contains representations of the individual neurons, which are connected to other simulated neurons via synapses. These links, as well as when they are likely to fire, are determined by basic biological principles and by experimental data from laboratory rodents.

The simulation can show the traffic patterns of the brain—the neurons firing in response to a stimulus. Unlike the aerial view of the real brain, however, the simulation can be paused, giving scientists a freeze frame showing which synapses are firing in response to a given stimulus. It is easy to convert this static image into a graph because it indicates the data points, as well as the lines between them: two neurons are connected if a synapse linking them is firing. From this picture, Hess constructed something that mathematicians refer to as a simplicial complex, transforming the simple graph into a voluminous shape.

A simplicial complex is built from triangles of different dimensions. In the Blue Brain graph, for example, three neurons with all three synapses between them transmitting signals formed the vertices of a hollow triangle. To expand this structure into a simplicial complex, the mathematicians colored in this hollow triangle with a solid, two-dimensional triangle. Similarly, they filled in larger clusters of connected neurons with higher-dimensional analogs of triangles. For example, a tetrahedron, a solid three-dimensional pyramid with four triangular faces, would fill in a group of four neurons firing together.

The maximum number of neurons that Hess and others observed firing as a group was eight, so the largest piece of this simplicial complex was a seven-dimensional triangle. Many elements overlapped, forming a multidimensional sculpture: a triangle might jut out of a tetrahedron and meet another triangle at a point. Moreover, the mathematicians and scientists examined not just one but a series of freeze frames, taken after simulating a gentle stroke of the rodent's whiskers. They converted each of these maps into a simplicial complex and analyzed how its shape changed in time using the tools of topology.

Immediately after receiving the stimulus, the simplicial complexes grew like a massive Lego construction, adding in pieces of higher and higher dimensions until the sculpture reached the maximum of three or four dimensions, depending on the stimulus. Then the whole thing rapidly disappeared. “You have these increasingly complex structures that are being created by the stimulus until it just all collapses,” Hess says.

To a topologist, three lines connected to make a triangle are the same as a hollow circle because one shape can be bent into the other. Because the simplicial complexes that Hess and her co-workers built from the simulated rodent brains are seven-dimensional, they can have holes in up to seven dimensions. Their analysis showed that as the shape grew, the number of holes increased. At its peak, the structure contained a surprisingly large number of two- and three-dimensional holes—many more than a random simplicial complex or one built from a different biological process would yield. The specific pattern of holes revealed a high level of organization in the neuronal response; this complexity may indicate a fundamental feature of thought processes.”

ZERO REGRETS Novel__My fiancé's childhood sweetheart twisted her ankle, and without hesitation, he became her personal chauffeur.","My fiancé's childhood sweetheart twisted her ankle, and without hesitation, he became her personal chauffeur.

When I expressed my dissatisfaction, he actually let his little childhood sweetheart move into the new home we had prepared for after our marriage.

He even had the audacity to tell me: ""It's your fault for being petty and not letting me drive Autumn to and from work. Her foot injury hasn't healed, and I don't want her walking such a long distance.""

""Our new place happens to be close to her company. We're not living there yet anyway, so it might as well be used.""

Even on the very day we were supposed to get our marriage license, he stood me up completely.

""Autumn sneezed twice this morning. I'm worried, so I'm taking her to the hospital. Getting the marriage certificate isn't urgent—we can reschedule for another day.""

Huh, reschedule my ass!

I immediately called my childhood friend:

""Nate Sullivan, want to get married with me? If yes, get your butt over here right now!""

...

I waited at the intersection for half an hour with no sign of my fiancé's car.

Usually by this time, he would have already parked and be waiting to drive me to work.

For three years, rain or shine, he'd never missed a day.

When my 20th call finally went through, a woman's voice answered.

""Hey, Rayna, Logan can't talk right now—he's driving.""

""I'm Autumn. I twisted my ankle this morning. Logan was worried and offered to drive me to work.""

""Put him on the phone,"" I demanded.

""Logan Harper! You couldn't bother to call and tell me you were picking up Autumn? Do you have any idea how worried I was?""

""It was an emergency and I was in a rush—completely forgot about you. By the way, I won't be able to drive you to and from work anymore.""

""Autumn hurt her ankle, so I need to drive her. That's all. Gotta go.""

My blood was boiling.

This Autumn was the ultimate queen of manipulation, and of course, men just ate it up.

So, I had to take a taxi to work, making me two hours late.

My boss—who also happens to be my childhood friend—called me into his office.

""What happened today? You're seriously late.""

""Don't even get me started. Logan ran off to pick up Autumn without telling me. I wasted time waiting for him, then went to his place looking for him. The whole thing was a wild goose chase.""

""What a jerk! Just Dump him and marry me instead!""

I rolled my eyes. ""Give me a break. I still remember you in diapers.""

Just then, my phone pinged with a message from Autumn.

\[Sorry, Rayna! Did you get in trouble with your boss for being late? I told Logan he didn't need to drive me, but he insisted. You don't mind, do you?\]

I replied: \[Thanks for your concern, but I'm the boss's favorite—I'm the one who scolds him, not the other way around.\]

\[And FYI, I'm three years younger than you, so I should be calling YOU 'sis.' Also, I absolutely DO mind Logan driving you every day, so take a taxi from now on.\]

That felt so—good.

Autumn quickly replied: \[Sorry, judging by your appearance, I thought you were older.\]

\[I told Logan I'd take a taxi, but he wouldn't listen. Maybe you should talk to him yourself.\]

Chapter 2

I showed my phone to Nate. ""See this? She's saying I look old!""

""Says the thirty-something who dresses in Lolita fashion trying to look young.""

Then Autumn posted on Facebook: \[My personal chauffeur's passenger seat\~\]

The photo showed her in the passenger seat of my car, head tilted to one side, with Logan's shoulder visible beside her.

Fuming, I called Logan.

""Finished escorting your precious Autumn? Meet me at the coffee shop below my office. We need to talk.""

Half an hour later, I faced Logan across the table.

""What's so important it couldn't be said over the phone?""

""How long are you planning to chauffeur Autumn around?""

""Sprains take time to heal—at least three months, I'd say.""

""Fine. Then give me back my car. I'll drive myself to work.""

The car Logan drove was actually mine.

When he first saw my Mercedes, he was practically drooling, saying he'd never driven such a nice car and wanted to try it.

Eventually, he just took over, appointing himself my personal driver, and I let him keep it.

""What am I supposed to drive if I give it back?""

""That car was a gift from my father so I could get to work easily. Now that you're not driving me anymore, I want it back. Any problem with that?""

""Can't you just take a taxi? You know I need to drive Autumn to work. When did you become so petty, Rayna?""

""Autumn's like a young sister to me. She's injured—shouldn't I help her?""

""Last I checked, you're an only child. When did you suddenly get a sister, Logan?""

""And why can't Autumn take a taxi? Besides, you're about to get married. Do you think it's appropriate to use your fiancée's car to chauffeur another woman around every day?""

I didn't want to waste any more words. I simply held out my hand:

""Keys. Now.""

Logan scowled for a long moment before finally saying, ""Fine, I won't drive her anymore. I didn't think this through. Happy now?""

""That's more like it.""

As the workday was ending, Logan called.

""Can't pick you up tonight. Helping a friend move.""

""Whatever. Just don't be late tomorrow morning.""

After hanging up, I noticed Nate leaning against my desk, watching me.

""What?""

""Want to bet your fiancé is making excuses to pick up his little damsel in distress?""

""No way. When he makes a promise, he keeps it.""

""You're that sure? What if he's taken her to his place to look after her?""

""That's even more ridiculous! What kind of person do you think he is?""

Despite my confident words, doubt crept in.

So that night, I video-called Logan:

""Are you alone?""

""Of course. Who else would be here?""

""Show me around your apartment. I want to see.""

""What, you think I'm hiding someone?""

Logan panned his phone around his rental apartment—No one else was there.

I finally relaxed.

Just as I was about to fall asleep, Autumn posted a late-night update that left me wide awake and staring at the ceiling.

Chapter 3

Autumn posted a selfie with the caption: \[Moving into my new place.\]

The wall art in her background was identical to the decorations in the new home Logan and I had prepared for after our wedding.

A sinking feeling hit my stomach, but I quickly dismissed it.

Logan wouldn't do something that outrageous...Right?

The next morning when Logan picked me up, I casually asked, ""Who were you helping move yesterday?""

""Just an old coworker. We were close at our last job, so when he asked for help, I went over.""

""What a coincidence. Autumn was moving yesterday too. She didn't ask you to help?""

""Really? No, she didn't. Probably hired movers.""

His quick answers seemed genuine enough, so I let my suspicions fade.

When the weekend rolled around, I bought some new decorations and asked Logan to come with me to our new place.

He visibly panicked for a split second.

""Uh... let's skip it. It's scorching hot today. Why don't we stay in and watch a movie instead?""

""Forget movies. If you won't come, I'll go by myself.""

Logan grabbed my arm quickly.

""How about this—I'll take you to that fancy Japanese restaurant you've been wanting to try, then we'll catch a movie after. My treat!""

This was completely out of character.

Logan was notorious for being cheap. When we went out, we took turns paying, but his ""turns"" always meant street food or budget chain restaurants.

Now he was suddenly offering to take me for expensive sushi?

Hell must've frozen over!

But I didn't call him out though. I went along with the Japanese dinner and movie—nearly costing him $500, which practically gave him a heart attack.

On the drive home, he kept mumbling about how I should treat him next time.

After he dropped me off at my apartment and drove away, I immediately caught a taxi to our new place.

Yet the digital lock there wouldn't accept my password after several attempts.

Thankfully, I had brought my key and used it to open the door.

What I saw inside left me speechless—

Our home—which I had meticulously decorated to my taste—was completely transformed.

The elegant Scandinavian art in the living room had been replaced with Crayon Shin-chan posters. Our beautiful brown leather sofa was covered with an ugly, fuzzy slipcover.

All our black and gold furniture had been painted white, and everything had been rearranged.

When I opened the master bedroom door, there was Autumn, sleeping in what was supposed to be MY marriage bed, using MY bridal silk bedding set!

I'd mentally prepared myself for the possibility that Autumn might be staying here, but I never imagined she would completely take over and redecorate our carefully planned home—and have the audacity to sleep in our marriage bed!

She jolted awake, startled. ""Rayna! Don't you knock before barging in? Who gave you permission to enter my home?""

I was so furious I could barely speak.

""Get this straight—this is MY home!""

""Logan said he's lending this place to me, so it's my home now. Didn't your mother teach you not to enter someone's house without permission?""",1,1751437210.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

I have a Reka blueberry in a pot inside, with rhododendron/blueberry soil from the beginning on. A week ago I also mixed in some coffee grounds because the leaves were/are really light with darker veins and according to what I found that means the soil Ph value was wrong. 
I water it roughly 3-4 times a week (the top layer of the soil is dry when I water it, but a few cm deeper is still moist), and it's never standing in direct sunlight. Temperature should vary between 25-35°C (which I know is a little too warm, but I don't have a cooler place in the apartment). 
Some of its leaves started turning brown and dying off and on most of the green leaves there's these tiny brown spots (see pictures) and I couldn't find anything online. Anyone know what that is and what to do about it?

Tldr: my blueberry plant has tiny brown spots and its leaves are dying, anyone know what that is? ",2,1751437164.0,gardening,1,1.0,False
