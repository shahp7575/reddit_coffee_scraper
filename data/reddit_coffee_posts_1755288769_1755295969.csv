1mrc2h1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mrc2h1,Almost done accessorizing (and my ACOTAR excitement!),"The details for the accessories are below, but first.. may I say that, on a recommendation, I bought A Court of Thorns and Roses (ACOTAR, I since learned!) and.. y'all.. I'm almost two days in, on chapter 32 and haven't logged anywhere near a respectable amount of sleep LOL!! Total page-turner-on-the-edge-of-my-couch-giving-my-dogs-anxiety kind of read! This book, no.. this series is amazing!! I hope it continues that way because I've already purchased the rest of the set and have added the author's other works to my TBR!

Okay. With that said, on to the accessories :) I've got a couple of inserts coming, so I'll share them once they arrive!

Page turner (thank you to everyone who suggested one!!)  
Took me awhile to settle on one because.. holy moly, sooo many options! I went with one that can charge both pieces at the same time (less cables!) and I appreciate how they magnetically attach to each other as I can see this reducing the chances of me misplacing one. (Though, I suppose it also increases the chances that I'll lose both LOL!) It also requires the absolute least amount of screen space. I have my margins set to the minimum and it still doesn't come close to interfering with the text.

MagSafe sticker, MagSafe ring holder & Pop Socket  
I went with a clear back case but really need a stand but also didn't want to lose wireless charging ability. I found a YT video showing this 'mod'. I figured out where the charging coils are and stuck the MagSafe sticker on.. viola! Now I can stick my nifty rotating ring holder on and flip the ring out for an insta-stand! The center of the ring holder is the perfect size for adding a Pop Socket too, so I found a fun one (that says tea not coffee!) and stuck that in the center. Perfect fit :)

Padded Sleeve  
Since I drive a school bus and take the kiddos on day-long, and some overnight, trips and I plan to take my Kindle with me, I knew I needed some kind of protection for it. After much searching, I got this gorgeous space purple padded sleeve and even with the added depth from the MagSafe ring holder and Pop Socket, the Kindle fits inside very well and the zipper doesn't strain at all when opening or closing. There is one outside pouch, closed with a Velcro tab, but it bulges just a bit too much for my liking when I tried putting my page turner in it. I'll have to find another solution for that but I can fit my work ID, CDL license and some spending money in the pouch no problem.

Clear Case  
Not much to say on this one.. I picked one that the reviews said doesn't yellow but it attracts fingerprints like CRAZY!! I've already ordered another clear back case in hopes that they aren't all this bad! I also want one with a hard back. I finally did find one so I'll share that once I get it, along with the inserts.",1,1755295807.0,kindle,0,0.99,False

The last 5 years it's increased exponentially since going off an SNRI (Effexor) & starting lexapro. Nearly every year, since I've had a bad flare & no  cause is ever determined. Doctors assume I must've taken an NSAID, but I literally avoid them because of the gastrointestinal side-effects.

It's been nearly 8 weeks of this flare and every day, it's following a pattern. Every morning, I get up & I feel pretty decent. I have a small coffee, then I eat breakfast. I'm fine still, no gas, no pain.

3-4 hours later, I'll have a light snack before I take my Lexapro. Less than an hour later, begins the belching & gas & flank rib pains.

On days when I forget to take it I've noticed little to no gastrointestinal issues.

1mrc0c7,https://i.redd.it/0iq5h8vz79jf1.jpeg,Help with a small cafe layout,"Hey all! I'm doing a freelance job where my client pretty much already have a design layout in mind for a coffee place (they're selling coffees, matcha and some pastries in a dry storage case). Basically the unit will be divided into 2, so we're just gonna focus on the cafe side. The cafe would just be a casual hangout space, less than 20 customers. Also bear in mind, the only sinks in this unit are inside the toilets. 



Option A is the original idea, but i'm having problem where the sink would take up the counter space? Since they need a single coffee grinder, coffee machine, the order and pick-up station, a roughly about 50-60cm dry display case for pastries and a waffle station.

Option B is my input, where i added a 50cm counter depth to place the additional sink there. So i tried putting a 950mm working space in between the counters. But the space next to the seats where people would order would be so small....

My client will be utilizing the spaces below the counters for storage, and he also needs to put both fridge and mini freezer in stated size (the sizes are all in mm).

Don't mind the space by the main door, since my client's planning to put a mirror there in front of the wall-mounted bench seats. He also wants a couch there where i put. Anyways, this is open for discussion and your feedback is much appreciated since this is my first freelance.",1,1755295665.0,floorplan,0,1.0,False

To my fellow Twin Peaks obsessives! Did you dig TP: the Return but are still scratching your head over what exactly you just watched? Did you want to have your coffee at the beginning of today's office meeting only to have that lucky bastard Dougie take it instead?  And then, when you were forced to try the green tea latte, were your tastebuds overtaken with such sweet sensation that your could only smile maniacally in satisfaction?  Did you, then, begin to suspect that you may secretly be...Mr Strawberry?  Did you?  So did I!!!!

My name is Phil. I have a show called the Post Relevant Podcast. Season 3 of the PRP is currently doing a scene by scene, often line by line decode of Twin Peaks: the Return. My co-host Justin and I are both in the film biz, and we chose to comb through each episode of this masterwork in the hopes to unwind Lynch and Frost's mysterious surrealist narrative. We try to come at it from every angle we can think of, observing film techniques, color choices, symbolism, esotericism, myth, dialogue, acting, green tea lattes - the whole shebang!

Plus, the show is scored with the amazing music of the electronic ear candy project Polypores! Also! Lots of little stories, comedy jokes, sound effects, and moments of easy-going chaos are peppered throughout the ep. And I spend time on my own observing magical synchronicities and time loops I've been experiencing since starting the decode of TP:TR - hopefully to good effect to yield more insight into the show.

Its an ambitious show, hopefully unlike anything you've ever heard before. I hope you will give it a try....

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/lucasGandola/comments/1mmsajf/im_a_trucker_on_a_highway_that_doesnt_exist_you/)

Okay guys. 

I really should clarify a few things at this point. The first of which being that while it is true―I may not have immediately read the *entire* employee handbook before the incidents of my last post―I had read *most* of it. Chapter headings, section descriptions, general overview, etc. Even if I’d read the entire part about hitchhikers, it wouldn’t have prevented the whole incident with Not-Myra. And plus, I'll remind you that *I’m not actually dead yet,* so I’m not entirely helpless.

The main issue with the employee handbook is that it’s vague. Sure, there are rules and guidelines, but I get the impression Randall and the rest of the dispatchers don’t entirely know what’s going on either. This road, Route 333, makes its own rules. It doesn’t always care to inform us about them.

Ok, and second thing.

I have actually gone to therapy before. I’d prefer not to get into it much with a bunch of anonymous online Redditors (no offense), but it wasn’t especially helpful. For some people I know therapy makes things harder first before it makes them better, but for me, it sort of just made things harder. And harder. And harder. Something about the vulnerability of it.

I’ve tried a few medications too, but I’ve heard some people are pretty resistant to them. I suspect that’s me. Even so, thank you for all your concerns. For real.

*Now.* Onto something more related to Route 333 and the many ways I repeatedly almost get myself killed―because let’s be real, that’s why you’re here, not to hear about my ever-degrading mental state. Mainly, I realize I haven't said much about the other truckers.

I’m sure to nobody’s surprise, I mainly avoided the other drivers the first few weeks at my job. Every few hours I’d pass one of them on Route 333 and give a small wave, but apart from that, I was in no rush to make new friends. Especially not ones in their forties and fifties. If it weren’t for the Faceless Man, I might have never gotten to know them at all.

There’s not much of a section in the employee handbook on the Faceless Man. The only mention is when it says, *The Faceless Man has learned how to unlock doors from the inside.*  

Like I said. Vague\*.\*

Ominous too though, so I made sure to close my windows and lock the doors every night before laying down on the cab sleeper. Generally, I’d leave the windows shut even if it was sweltering, but one night it got especially sweltering.

There weren’t many clouds in the sky. I’d already tossed and turned in my sweaty sheets for an hour before I decided to let in some air.

*Just a crack*.

I even wiggled my fingers in the open space to make sure that’s all that could get through. When I tried to sleep this time, there was enough of a breeze to let me. 

The next time I woke, it was still night. The moon was covered by clouds, but enough light made it through to illuminate the interior of the cab.

*Clouds.*

I sat up.

There was no reason to be afraid. I knew this. I hadn't broken any rules. The doors were locked and secured. Even so, I glanced first at the driver’s side window and then the passenger.

My entire existence jerked to a stop.

It stared at me through the glass―at least that’s what I assumed it was doing. The thing had no eyes, no ears, no hair, and no mouth. The only feature reminiscent of a living creature's were two snake-like slits in the middle of the face. A nose of some sort.

It faced me. It smelled. I could audibly *hear* the inhale even through the door, and the slits widened to holes the size of chestnuts. Light from the truck stop caught on each individual hair, almost like teeth.

*Hello?* I tried, but no sound came out. I forced my throat to clear, and tried again. “Do you need something? Are you―are you the Faceless Man?”

*Right. Because of course the thing with no ears or mouth is going to hear you and respond.* And then I thought, *maybe the name Faceless Man is somehow offensive*, so I immediately asked, “unless you prefer to be called something different?” Because apparently I’d literally already forgotten this thing COULD NOT hear me.

If you can’t tell, I tend to overthink whilst in uncomfortable situations.

By this point I’d already experienced enough oddities of the road that I was content to just curl there in the corner and wait until the thing left. That’s exactly what I would have done―if the Faceless Man hadn't reached a hand with seven fingers up and tapped the glass.

Quick clarification. When I say fingers, that’s probably precisely what you envision: fingers. What I *really* mean is seven bleach white protrusions, each a meter long, with dozens of joints and gnarled nails curling from their tips. 

I watched in horror as each of the fingers felt along the glass, found the lip, then snaked inwards.

“Nope!” I told it. “That’s not happening. You’re not doing that.”

I scrambled for my pants, then decided it really wasn’t worth it, and clambered for the driver seat in my boxers. The Faceless Man inhaled again and swiveled to follow my movement.

“Out!” I commanded and twisted the key. The truck roared to life.

The ivory fingers felt around, sliding past the unlock button and heading directly for the inner handle.

“One last chance,” I warned―even though it was entirely clear by now the thing wasn’t able to hear me. When it predictably continued to not be able to hear me, I did what anybody would do in this situation: I rolled up the window.

They flattened. Each cylindrical finger compressed where the glass closed into them, and the thing outside shuddered in pain. It yanked at them, trying to escape but unable. I gave it two more seconds, then cracked the window again. 

The Faceless Man yanked its fingers from my car, exhaled greenish globs of what I suspect was snot on my window, then skittered away.

Needless to say, I got an early start that morning.

While that whole incident did shake me up **(and made me demand a rig with internal AC, non-negotiable)**, it reminded me of something. The Faceless Man had tracked my movements by smelling me. Maybe that was just a coincidence. Probably, smells were how it was drawn to any human…

But there was already another subset of road-dwellers who apparently knew my scent. Could the Faceless Man somehow be connected?

The employee handbook said very little about the topic, and Randall hadn't seemed overly talkative when I’d asked him about the things in the forest. I approached a few co-workers instead.

They explained that *no,* the Faceless Man probably wasn’t connected to the things in the forest. They were confined to the forest. He was confined to cloudy nights. He was just a harmless pest, basically like a raccoon, looking for somewhere to warm up (though, he would occasionally suffocate people by shoving his fingers down their throat, so maybe not entirely harmless). They also told me not to trust any energy drink brands I didn’t recognize at gas stations and to avoid coffee at late night diners. 

The coffee wasn’t dangerous. It just was nasty.

I started talking with the other drivers at the truck yard before and after hauls. We’d chat when we stopped for showers at the same time and radio greetings when we passed each other on the road. Slowly, I got to know some of them.

Deidree was a divorced mom of three. She hated she had to be away from her kids for such long stretches, but this job’s pay was the only way she’d be able to send her oldest to college.

Then there was Vigram. He immigrated with his family from India about ten years ago. He tried taxi-ing in Chicago, but the pay was crap and the people were rude. He liked long-hauling much better.

Chris was more of a short-hauler. He’d been on Route 333 for almost fifteen years, longer than anybody else. He’d started like me with an extremely short drive time, and the road had taken its sweet time expanding for him. He mainly did short trips now to be safe, one or two day hauls. That’s how long it took him to get out of the redwood section to the first turnaround point (from my interview). About 10X slower than me still. Even so, he could still cover ground quicker than some of the others.

“I’ll be done in a year or two,” he confided in me once over breakfast at a diner. “They pay me more than anybody, but takes me longer t’get anything done. Besides, don’t wanna risk getting lane-locked.”

That's what we call it. Lane-locked\*.\* Usually, Route 333 expands at an even pace, but eventually, without warning, it will one day explode in length. What took hours to drive the previous day might take weeks or even years now. 

There’s signs to watch out for―less stars in the sky than usual, rest stop attendants getting colder to you, expansion at an increasing pace―but it’s impossible to predict the exact moment lane-locking happens. There’s always a risk of getting taken unawares.

“It’s like a fever breaking,” Deidree explained to me. “We’re the virus. It takes a minute for the highway to get immune to us, but once it does, it happens all at once.”

There’s a small stretch far out into the desert where it’s common to see a neon orange flatbed heading the direction of the real world. Sometimes it’s missing. It slips into pockets of the road the rest of us luckily haven’t accessed yet, but always, eventually, you see the flatbed again. Same area. Still driving.

“How long has he been going now,” I asked Chris one morning.

“Six, maybe seven years? Al’s a good guy. We’ll pull over and talk ‘casionally. His time came quicker than most.”

“How much ground has Al covered?”

Chris exhaled through his mouth and shook his head. “To you? A few miles maybe. He’ll never make it back, not’n a hundred years. He has a family though. He refuses to quit.”

Some do though. Some accept they’re stuck, that it’s not worth years of their life trying to get out, and find a new sort of life on Route 333.

People like Tiff.

The first time I met Tiff, I was getting coffee at three in the morning at the Wayside Diner. 

It’s true. The coffee at late night diners on Route 333 is truly, utterly disgusting, but I was desperate for any sort of caffeine, however crappy. I was only a few hours from the truck yard terminal, and if possible, I try not to sleep on the highway more than absolutely necessary.

Call me high maintenance, but I’m still not a fan of waking up to see Mr. Nose sniffing longingly at me.

A middle-aged waitress delivered my coffee and waited there as I sipped it.

“What the…” I looked up at her. “This is actually palatable.”

“Not exactly a compliment, but I’ll take it.” The woman slid in the booth across from me. “You must be the new one. Brendon, right?”

“Uh, yeah?” I wasn’t used to people on Route 333 knowing who I was, or really even acknowledging me. It was still unclear from the handbook and my interactions with them if they were actual people or just sort of *there.* This woman seemed different though. 

“I’m Tiff. Former employee turned waitress.”

“I’ve heard of you. The others, they mention you.”

“Still remember me do they? Glad to hear I’m not entirely forgotten. Almost never visit me anymore.”

“You work here?”

She shrugged. “When I want. Staffing lets me fill in―not so sure if they’re *letting* me, as much as I tell them I work here and they believe me. Doesn’t pay anything, but it’s not like I need money anymore, just like chatting. I *much* prefer real people though.”

She clasped her hands, and muscles flexed along her fully tattooed arms. Tiff was exactly the type of tough woman you’d imagine would become a trucker―well, that mixed with the sort of desperate, lonely friendliness only found at an old folks home.

“Tell me,” she said. “What was your first reaction when you realized Route 333 wasn’t a normal road? I always ask that.”

“I don’t think I’ve ever screamed at an interviewer before.”

She laughed. “And after you started working?”

“It was… a bit weird. I guess? I don’t know. I just sort of accepted it.”

“A *bit* weird?” She eyed me, then reached for my cup and took a swig. “You seem like somebody going through something.”

*True enough.*

We talked for hours that night. She grabbed us some pie from the counter, and she asked about my life and talked about hers. 

She’d been offered a position on Route 333 for years before she actually accepted. She’d heard the rumors. She knew the sort of dangers it offered. When she finally took a position it was only because her daughter got a brain tumor. Treatment was expensive. Her daughter didn’t survive, but after that, Tiff kept hauling to stave off the loneliness.

I told her I understood. 

She told me that *no, I didn’t* actually, seeing how I was a *twenty-odd-something puppy boy* but that I probably had my own similar thing I did understand that was close enough, so she wasn't offended.

By the time we called it quits, the sun was already rising. I don’t remember everything we talked about, but I do remember myself standing up, patting her shoulder and saying, “I’ll talk to Randall. We’ll find some way for you to get out of here.”

Her face went dark. “You shouldn’t have said that. Not where the road can hear you.”

I slept a few hours, then got up around noon. Before I left, I decided to take a shower.

The water in the personal shower room was cold. I waited a few minutes for it to heat up, but when it didn’t, I decided that realistically there were people dying from parasites in other countries, and a cold shower likely wouldn’t result in a grueling end.

It did still suck though. I finished that thing in a minute flat, then twisted the faucet to *off.*

The water didn’t stop.

I tried twisting it the other way. The water only got stronger. And the drain in the floor― it had stopped working. Freezing water was building up in a puddle. Soon, it overflowed the lip of the shower, and onto the tile.

I sighed, dressed, and went for the door. My shower sandals slapped all the way there. It was locked. I flipped the lock back and forth, but any way I attempted, the door wouldn’t budge. I pounded at it until the cold touch of water licked my ankles.

It was around then I realized I was in trouble.

“Hey!” I screamed repeatedly, but nobody seemed to hear me. The water was at my knees now. *How is it coming so fast?*

I waded back to the shower, tried the handle again, then did my first truly stupid thing of this incident (you all know by now I’m bound to do something stupid eventually). I bound my towel around the showerhead to stop the flow, which didn’t work a bit. Then I proceeded to slip, trip, and yank the towel with me. The showerhead tore off.

The rate of water doubled.

It was at my shoulders now. The water started pumping out brown and sludgy. It was too murky to see through, and my feet― things began to *brush* against them. *Just my clothes,* I told myself, but since when did my clothes have scales?

I pounded at the door. I stood on the handle to keep my face above the water. There had to be some way out. I couldn’t die like this. There was only a foot of breathable air now. Then six inches. Then one.

I gasped a final breath as the slimy, scaled things wrapped around my ankles and jerked me down. I flailed to escape, but where would I go? There was no more air. The entire room was full of glacier water.

My vision started dimming. I felt my throat convulsing, begging me to breathe. I couldn’t resist anymore―

The door flew open. Hundreds of gallons of water sloshed out of the bathing room into the hallway. It slammed me against the wall, but I gasped and struggled to my feet.

When I stood, the hallway was dry. The shower room was dry. My dirty clothes were in a heap on the bench where I’d left them, totally―you guessed it―dry. The only thing that was sopping wet was me.

Tiff walked into the hallway a few seconds later with a garbage bag. She glanced from me in my sopping clothes to the open door of the shower room, then back to me. “I told you you shouldn’t have said that.”

“What just happened?” I demanded, followed by a fountain of colorful words.

“A threat. The road doesn’t like to give up things it's claimed for its own. Don’t try to help me escape, Brendon.”

With that, she shook her head, stepped over the puddle at my feet, and carried the trash down the hallway.

It took me some time to change my clothes, dry off, and even more time to calm down. Once I had, I was finally able to think

The way Tiff had told me not to help her had been calm. Resigned. She’d given up years ago. She’d accepted this truck stop and its miniature diner was her life now, because the only alternative was something worse. 

The road had claimed her. It wanted her to stay, and it would hurt anyone who tried to take her―except it couldn’t hurt me.

That realization. That shining understanding, more golden than any moment of happiness, filled me with hope. Route 333 couldn’t hurt me because I had nothing I cared about. It could kill me, but so what? Why should that bother me?

My life didn’t matter to me, which meant I could defy the road all I wanted. Tiff might have given up, but I hadn't. I was going to get her out or die trying. I’d finally found something I hadn't had in years.

Spent today teaching undergrads about intrinsic motivation while my own motivation is held together by caffeine and the sunk cost fallacy.

Anyone else feel like they're performing expertise about the human condition while completely disconnected from their own? I know the DSM criteria for depression but apparently knowing and experiencing are wildly different things.

Also why is it that I can spot statistical p-hacking from a mile away but somehow convinced myself that ""I'll be happy after tenure"" isn't just academic magical thinking?

Maybe this is just what happens when you study the thing you need most but can't seem to access for yourself. Or maybe I'm just having an existential crisis disguised as academic burnout.

Either way, if you're also out here explaining psychological wellbeing to others while your own mental health is held together by deadlines and imposter syndrome, you're not alone.

Also does anyone have thoughts on whether our field is actually helping people or are we just really good at making suffering sound scientific?

All women of all ages and walks of life are welcome! Please note that it’s not an anti-children/babies platform - it’s a space to be respectful of everyone’s choices while connecting through our own! Kind vibes only please! <3

This is a new group as there didn’t seem to be a Cardiff-based childfree group for women (the closest one was Bristol) so… here we go for all the childfree Cardiff women!

We’ll start off with monthly walks around Cardiff, coffee meet ups, brunches, cinema trips, drinks and will be very open to activity suggestions for future events as we (hopefully) expand! Would love for others to want to get involved!

There are lots of reasons why people might want to join a Childfree group:

*Maybe you’re one of only a few women in your life who are childfree
*Your friends who have children aren’t as free to meet up anymore
*You want to chat through your choices with other women walking a similar path
*You’re new to Cardiff and want to make some new friends
*Maybe you’re childfree by circumstance and want to connect with others

Whatever the reason, we’re excited you’ve found the group!

Keep an eye out for our first and upcoming events here! Can’t wait to meet you!

--------------------------------------------------------------

Many people find themselves grabbing fast food meals due to busy schedules, making it challenging to maintain healthy eating habits. However, making nutritious choices on the go is possible with a little knowledge and preparation. Here’s a guide to help you navigate healthy fast food options.

### Understanding Healthy Fast Food Choices

When you enter a fast food restaurant, the menu might seem overwhelming. There are many tempting options, but not all of them contribute to a healthy diet. Start by focusing on meals that are balanced. Aim for options that include:

- Lean proteins, such as grilled chicken or fish
- Whole grains, like brown rice or whole-wheat bread
- Lots of vegetables in your sandwich or salad
- Healthy fats, such as those found in avocados and nuts

### Make Smart Substitutions

Many restaurants offer substitutions that can transform a calorie-laden meal into a nutritious one. Here are some tips to keep in mind:

Get A Healthy Eating PDF Guide: https://healthyeatingguide.me/?ref=fromsubreddithealthyeating  
  
- Swap fries for a side salad or apple slices.
- Choose grilled over fried options whenever possible.
- Request sauces on the side to control how much you use.
- Order a smaller portion or kids' meal if available.

### Reading the Nutrition Information

Most fast food chains provide nutrition information that can guide your choices. Look for key figures:

- Calories per serving
- Amounts of saturated fat and trans fat
- Protein content per meal
- Sodium levels, as many fast food items are high in salt

By keeping an eye on these numbers, you can make informed choices to keep your meal nutritious.

### Opting for Healthier Meal Options

Fast food restaurants are beginning to offer healthier choices. Here are some menu items to consider when you're in a hurry:

- Salads with a lean protein, such as grilled chicken or shrimp
- Bowl meals featuring plenty of veggies, lean protein, and whole grains
- Vegetable wraps or sandwiches with fresh ingredients
- Fruit or yogurt cups instead of dessert

### Pay Attention to Beverage Choices

Drinks can add a significant number of calories and sugar to your meal. Instead of soda or sugary drinks, consider:

Get A Healthy Eating PDF Guide: https://healthyeatingguide.me/?ref=fromsubreddithealthyeating  
  
- Water or sparkling water with lime
- Unsweetened iced tea or coffee
- Low-calorie or no-calorie flavored drinks

Making smart beverage choices is an excellent way to reduce your overall calorie intake while dining out.

### Plan Ahead When Possible

While fast food can be convenient, planning ahead can save you time and help you stick to healthier options. Before hitting the drive-thru, check the restaurant's menu online. Many places list their nutrition information, making it easy to pick a healthy meal.

Consider keeping healthy snacks handy in your car or bag, such as:

- Mixed nuts
- Protein bars
- Veggie sticks with hummus
- Fruit, like bananas or apples

Having snacks ready can lessen the temptation to opt for unhealthy fast food choices when hunger strikes.

### Practice Mindful Eating

While enjoying fast food, try to practice mindful eating. This means paying attention to your hunger cues and savoring each bite. Eating slowly can help you feel full faster and prevent you from overeating.

Being aware while you eat can turn a rushed meal into a more satisfying experience, regardless of where you choose to dine.

Choosing healthy fast food options is entirely feasible with some preparation and awareness. By focusing on nutritious ingredients, making smart substitutions, and planning ahead, you can enjoy convenient meals without compromising your health goals. Remember, it’s all about balance and making informed choices while on the go!

Strategies for Balancing Fast Food with a Healthy Diet
------------------------------------------------------

When life gets busy, sometimes fast food is your only option. Whether you’re rushing to work, managing a busy household, or simply don’t feel like cooking, fast food can be tempting. However, it’s possible to enjoy fast food without straying too far from your health goals. Here’s how you can balance fast food with a healthy diet.

### Choose Wisely

Fast food menus often contain a mix of healthier choices and unhealthy options. The key is to make informed selections that satisfy your cravings without loading up on calories, sugar, and unhealthy fats. Here are some tips:

Get A Healthy Eating PDF Guide: https://healthyeatingguide.me/?ref=fromsubreddithealthyeating  
  
- **Look for Grilled Options:** Opt for grilled chicken sandwiches instead of fried. Grilled foods retain flavor without excess calories from oil.
- **Go for Whole Grains:** Choose whole-grain buns or wraps whenever possible. They offer more fiber and nutrients than their white bread counterparts.
- **Customize Your Order:** Don’t hesitate to ask for no cheese, extra veggies, or sauces on the side. This allows you to manage calorie intake better.
- **Watch for Portions:** Fast food servings are often large. Consider ordering smaller sizes or sharing a meal to cut down on calories.

### Balance Your Meal

Fast food doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing decision. If you’re indulging in a burger and fries, consider balancing your meal with healthier choices throughout the day. Here are some ideas:

- **Start with a Nutritious Breakfast:** A healthy breakfast can set the tone for the day. Consider oatmeal or yogurt to keep your energy levels steady.
- **Include Fruits and Vegetables:** Make your fast food meal more nutritious by adding a side salad or opting for fruit instead of fries when available.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Opt for water, unsweetened iced tea, or seltzer over sugary sodas. Staying hydrated can help you feel full and make better choices.
- **Mind the Timing:** Try to enjoy fast food as an occasional treat rather than a regular part of your diet. This creates space for healthier meals at home.

### Plan Ahead

One of the best strategies for balancing fast food with a healthy diet is planning. If you know you’ll be out and about, think ahead. Here’s how:

Get A Healthy Eating PDF Guide: https://healthyeatingguide.me/?ref=fromsubreddithealthyeating  
  
- **Research Menu Options:** Many fast food restaurants publish nutrition information online. Review menus or apps before heading out to choose wisely.
- **Set Up Meal Deals:** Order a smaller meal or an item off the kids' menu to help control portions while still enjoying a treat.
- **Pre-Plan Fast Food Stops:** If dining out is unavoidable, have a game plan for making healthier choices at your favorite spots.
- **Use Online Nutrition Calculators:** Some apps can help you find healthier fast food options based on your dietary needs.

### Practice Mindful Eating

When indulging in fast food, practice mindfulness to enhance your experience and make better choices. Here’s how to eat mindfully:

- **Slow Down:** Take your time to enjoy your meal. This helps you listen to your body’s hunger and fullness cues.
- **Enjoy Every Bite:** Focus on flavors, textures, and aromas. Mindful eating can lead to greater satisfaction.
- **Avoid Distractions:** Put down your phone or avoid watching TV while eating. This makes it easier to pay attention to how much you’re consuming.

With these strategies, you can find a balanced approach to enjoying fast food while maintaining a healthy diet. Remember that moderation and making informed choices can keep you on track with your health goals while still allowing for the occasional fast food craving. Make each meal a thoughtful experience, and you’ll feel better both physically and mentally.

### Conclusion

Navigating the world of fast food doesn’t have to derail your commitment to a healthy diet. By recognizing and opting for healthy fast food options, you can make nutritious choices even when you’re on the go. Look for items packed with protein, fiber, and whole grains, while keeping an eye on portions and added sugars. Many fast-food restaurants now offer salads, grilled items, and fresh sides that can serve as excellent alternatives to traditional greasy fare.

Balancing fast food with a healthy diet involves strategy and planning. You don’t have to sacrifice your favorite foods entirely. Instead, consider planning ahead by choosing menu items that align with your dietary goals. Aim for meals that incorporate a variety of food groups. Pairing a lean protein with whole grains and vegetables can create a satisfying meal that fuels your day without scrimping on taste.

Moreover, don’t shy away from customizing your orders. Request dressings or sauces on the side, or swap out calorie-dense sides for healthier options like fruit or steamed vegetables. This simple shift gives you control over what you eat while enjoying the convenience of fast food.

Ultimately, making conscious food choices while dining out is key. With a little effort, you can enjoy quick meals and maintain a healthy lifestyle without feeling deprived. Remember, eating well is all about balance and moderation, and even fast food can fit into your healthy eating plan when chosen wisely.",1,1755295264.0,healthyeatingguide,0,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I researched fertilizers and soil amendments to try to figure out what they needed.

1mrbi47,https://i.redd.it/cqrn2pcx69jf1.jpeg,There are soo many amazing cozy game bundles out right now!! (w/ a semi-comprehensive list),"Hi everyone!! I don't post often, but I noticed that recently there are SO. MANY. cozy games available in bundles right now (not to mention the Cozy Games Steam sale that just released, wtf) and as a freaking BUNDLE FANATIC I wanted to make a comprehensive-ish list of all the ones that I'm aware of!!

(Also, I originally tried to write and post this three times on /CozyGamers and it kept getting removed with no auto-mod message... I have no idea whyyyy... I put so much effort into typing it out...)

*\*\*Just to be clear, the graphic I made is not games from ONE bundle but a bunch of games from different bundles. I was considering making graphics for every bundle, but that would be too much work, so I just tried to include the ones I thought were most well-known.*

So, I saw a couple of bundles already mentioned here, but **I haven't seen the Tiltify Cosy Up for Wishes REMIX bundles mentioned yet**!! The original bundles were at pretty steep prices (like, $30-50) but they re-released some bundles at $15 each, and I think they're really amazing deals! Also it goes to charity!!

Also, they JUST announced that they're going to remove the bundles September 1st! So get on these bundles while you still can :)

* There's [Cosy Up for Wishes Bundle B](https://tiltify.com/make-a-wish-intl/cosy-up-for-wishes), which includes Capybara Spa, Gibbon: Beyond The Trees, A Monster's Expedition, Critter Cafe, Lemon Cake, Stranded Sails, Railbound, Winkeltje: The Little Shop, Wingspan, and Projected Dreams!! ($15 for all)
* There's also [Cosy Up for Wishes Bundle C](https://tiltify.com/make-a-wish-intl/cosy-up-for-wishes), which includes A Perfect Day, Chillquarium, City Bus Manager, Garden of the Sea, Haven Park, Lost Ember, Parkasaurus, Plantera, Quilts & Cats of Calico, Spells & Secrets, Train Valley 1, and Train Valley 2! ($15 for all)

There's only \~194 bundles left for B, and \~417 bundles left for C, so buy them while they're still available! And don't ask about Bundle A... It sold out while I was traveling and I am still crying screaming throwing up over it. I advise you to NOT CHECK the games for Bundle A because you'll probably be mad it's sold out too >:(

**Next, these are the bundles I saw already mentioned on this subreddit**, but will repeat here:

* [Fanatical's Build Your Own Cozy Games bundle](https://www.fanatical.com/en/pick-and-mix/build-your-own-cozy-games-bundle), which is $1.45-1.65 per game depending on how many games you buy, and includes A Tiny Sticker Tale, Pixelshire, Sticky Business, Lemon Cake, Hokko Life, Outlanders, Hidden in my Paradise, Paper Trail, Re:Fresh, Lake, Hidden Cats: Triple Pack, My Little Life, Button City, Alchemy Story, Bunny Park, Cyrano, Coffee Shop Tycoon, No Place Like Home (Sold out), and The Witness (sold out)!

Two of the games already sold out BUT I will say that Fanatical sometimes restocks the keys so if you're specifically interested in those I'd say maybe check back? I'm not really sure!! I do know Fanatical is active on Reddit so you can probably contact them and ask if needed (their username is WeAreFanatical).

* [Humble Bundle August 2025 Choice](https://www.humblebundle.com/membership), which is $15 and includes My Time at Sandrock, Lil Gator Game, Wildmender, Let's School, and other non-cozy games!! (which includes Persona 5 Royal, which is a pretty popular JRPG!)

**I ALSO want to mention the Amazon Prime games available right now**, so in case you happen to have that subscription, definitely check their gaming section!

* The [Amazon Prime cozy games](https://gaming.amazon.com/home) include: Venba, Toem, Paquerette Down the Bunburrows, and Station to Station! And the free games on Luna available to play this month include Dungeons of Hinterburg and Monster Harvest!!

I would go more into depth as to what the games are about but then this post would be wayy longer than it needs to be... ANYWAYS!!! I literally got ALL of these bundles and am planning to get the Humble choice this month. I literally will be spending like, $70 on just game bundles by the end of this week, but I'll be getting like a million games for it so I think it's worth it??!

The games I'm personally really excited about playing are Railbound, Winkeltje, Garden of the Sea, Haven Park, Lake, My Time at Sandrock, and Paquerette Down the Bunburrows!!

Lower-grade materials like painted steel are more susceptible to rust and may require more frequent replacement.

**Weather Resistance Rating:**

A crucial factor in selecting an exterior hanging pendant light is its weather resistance rating, ofen indicated by an IP (Ingress Protection) rating. Aim for a rating of IP44 or higher,signifying protection against water splashes from any direction. higher ratings, like IP65 or IP67, offer even greater protection, making them suitable for locations directly exposed to heavy rain or snow. Understanding the IP rating ensures your light can withstand the rigors of outdoor use without compromising its performance or safety.

**Light Output and Color Temperature:**

Consider the desired light output and color temperature to achieve the desired ambience. Measured in lumens, light output determines the brightness of the fixture. Common options for exterior environments would range from 800 to 1600 lumens. Color temperature, measured in Kelvins (K), affects the warmth or coolness of the light. Warmer temperatures (2700K-3000K) create a cozy and inviting atmosphere, while cooler temperatures (4000K-5000K) offer brighter, more focused illumination. Choose an LEAD bulb with adjustable color temperature for added versatility.

**Style and design:**

Exterior hanging pendant lights are available in a wide range of styles, from classic lantern designs to contemporary minimalist options.Consider the architectural style of your home and the overall aesthetic of your outdoor space when selecting a design.Traditional homes often benefit from ornate,vintage-inspired fixtures,while modern homes may be better suited to sleek,geometric designs.Pay attention to the finish, shape, and decorative elements to ensure the light complements your existing outdoor décor.

**Installation and Maintenance:**

ease of installation and maintenance are key considerations for any exterior lighting fixture. Look for models that come with clear, concise installation instructions and all necessary hardware. Consider fixtures with open designs or removable glass panels for easy bulb replacement and cleaning.

**Energy Efficiency:**

As energy costs continue to rise, consider selecting exterior hanging pendant lights that utilize energy-efficient LED technology. LED bulbs consume substantially less energy than traditional incandescent or halogen bulbs,resulting in lower electricity bills and a reduced carbon footprint. Look for Energy Star-certified fixtures to ensure optimal energy efficiency and performance. Many LED lights also offer longer lifespans, reducing the need for frequent bulb replacements.

## FAQs Section

**What type of bulb should I use in my exterior hanging pendant light?**
LED bulbs are the preferred choice for exterior hanging pendant lights due to their energy efficiency, long lifespan, and weather resistance. Look for LED bulbs specifically designed for outdoor use and with a suitable brightness (lumens) and color temperature (Kelvins) for your needs. Incandescent bulbs are less energy-efficient and have shorter lifespans, while halogen bulbs can generate excessive heat.

**How high should I hang my exterior pendant light above the ground?**
The ideal height for an exterior hanging pendant light depends on its location. For lights hanging over doorways or pathways, aim for a clearance of at least 7 feet. For lights over outdoor dining tables or seating areas, a lower height of 6-7 feet might potentially be appropriate to provide focused illumination. Adjust the height based on the specific dimensions of your space to ensure adequate clearance and optimal lighting.

**Can I install an exterior hanging pendant light myself, or should I hire an electrician?**
If you are comfortable working with electrical wiring and have experience with home improvement projects, you may be able to install an exterior hanging pendant light yourself. Though, if you are unsure about any aspect of the installation process, it's always best to hire a qualified electrician. Working with electricity can be dangerous, and a professional can ensure the installation is done safely and correctly, complying with all local codes and regulations.

**How often should I clean my exterior hanging pendant light?**
Regular cleaning can help maintain the appearance and performance of your exterior hanging pendant light. Aim to clean your light at least once or twice a year, or more frequently if it is indeed exposed to harsh weather conditions or critically important dirt and grime. Use a mild detergent and soft cloth to gently clean the fixture, removing any dust, dirt, or debris.Avoid using abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals, as these can damage the finish of the light.

1mrbavn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sysadminhumor/comments/1mrbavn/the_annoyotron_incident/,The Annoy-o-tron Incident,"*(A True Sysadmin Tale)*

It started, as these things often do, with boredom… and a little black box of pure mischief known as the *Annoy-o-tron*.

For the uninitiated, the Annoy-o-tron is a tiny electronic gremlin — a circuit that emits a faint, random beep every few minutes. Not loud enough to pinpoint, but *just* enough to drive a person to madness.

My target? The building manager.  
My method? Simple. I affixed the device to the *back side* of one of his desk drawers — the kind of old-school, all-metal school desk that could survive a small nuclear event.

The other staff were in on it.  
So, the first time he asked, “Did you hear that?” we all shook our heads.  
“Nope. Must be your imagination.”

Day one: mild confusion.  
Day two: rising suspicion.  
Day three… I arrived at work to find his *entire office emptied into the hallway*. I mean **everything** — desk, chairs, filing cabinets, personal items, all stripped from the room.

Then, without a word, he walked into my office, placed the Annoy-o-tron on my desk, looked me dead in the eyes, and simply said:

>

From that moment, an *unspoken war* began — harmless jabs, verbal feints, small acts of sabotage.  
It was fun… until the day we started trading threats.

Me: “Remember… I control your password, how often it expires, and how long it has to be.”  
Him: “Remember… I control your heat in this office.”  
Me: “I can lock you out of your own system in one click.”  
Him: “I have a full maintenance crew, they have a backhoe, and you have a *brand new truck*.”

There was a long pause.  
I slowly set down my coffee cup.

“…You win.”

And thus, the *Sysadmin–Building Manager Non-Aggression Pact* was signed.

**1 - calorie deficit (without starving)**  
fat loss = eating less than you burn. boring but true

your body burns calories just existing, moving, digesting, and working out. figure out roughly what that number is (online calorie calculator) and eat like 300–500 less than that.  
example: burn 2500 → eat \~2000–2200

tips:

* don’t starve yourself, it’ll backfire (ur body slows down ur metabolism if you crash dieat too hard)
* track with an app if you need
* look at your *weekly* average, not just daily numbers

**2 - lift weights (but make it femme)**  
squats, split squats, leg press for thighs  
rdls, good mornings for hammies + lower back  
hip thrusts, kickbacks for glutes (THICCC)  
core work for flat tummy + abs

why? keeps your muscle while cutting so you stay toned, and muscle burns more calories without doing anything

**3 - protein is your bff**  
aim for \~2g per kg bodyweight (so 140g if you’re 70kg).  
don’t wanna count? just make sure every meal has a solid protein source

easy ideas:

* greek yogurt (with chunky flavor)
* protein waffles with fruit + zero sugar syrup
* shrimp tacos
* cottage cheese with cinnamon + sweetener (sounds cursed but tastes like cheesecake)

**4 - hacks for hunger**

* caffeine (coffee/tea, just not before bed)
* gum
* shirataki noodles with soy sauce + chili flakes (zero calories)
* diet soda / sparkling water / sugar free monster
* intermittent fasting (eat in an 8hr window)

extra: ditch liquid calories, eat big portions of low-cal veggies, walk 20 mins after meals (bonus points in thigh highs)

**final note**  
weight loss is hard, especially juggling femininity + AMAB biology. some days you’ll eat a whole pizza, some days you’ll feel like a greek statue. both are fine. drink water, focus on progress over perfection, and treat yourself when you hit milestones. Dont try to make up for bad days.

if you slip up? welcome to the club. just get back on track and keep going 💖

I (F,38) had these two close friends (both F in their 30’s). We knew eachother from working together, but I changed jobs for a while. During that period we all happend to be pregnant and we our baby’s were born within the same month. That gave us something to really bond over. 

And really: we were close. We’d talk about everything, have coffee dates with our kids present and did “girls night out” and went on trips together.

When our kids turned 3, we all ended up working for the same company again. It was fun to be working with friends.
At some point, a forth coworker asked to join our “group”. She has a child the same age, and she needed a “village “ to raise him as well. So she started joining our girls nights, dates, etc. 

I ended up not really liking her at all. She would make side comments that would make me feel bad or insecure like all the time. For example, i was doing this lifestyle program which helped me loose 10 kilograms. She also wanted to start losing weight, so when she asked, I gave her a few of the insides my own journey had taught me, only for her to say “Nah, I want to take this a little more seriously than you did”. 

Another example was her looking at a picture of my son in an outfit he was extremely proud of, only to say “it wasn’t the right brand but a fake”. 

Stuff like this just went on and on and at some point i’d have enough. I told all 3 of the girls this setup wasn’t working for me anymore, half hoping the girls who were my friends first would still continue to be my friends, but they ended up becoming “the 3 of them”, shutting me out of the group. 

Shit happens, people grow apart, i suppose that’s life. 
However, we’re all stuck at the same employer, and they gossip about me. A lot. It’s been difficult to supervise their work (i have a somewhat higher position then the 3 of them) with them constantly diagreeing with choices i make or work i’ve done, and then running towards eachother for support (or to trash talk about me) instead of just talking to me in person. 

I’ve tried talking to them about this, but they just keep coming at me with stuff like “you made your bed, nothing we can do now”. It’s stressful and quite frankly, it hurts that people i felt like were family, now treat and hurt me like this.

I do love my job, and i’d rather not leave this employer, but this situation, being confronted with the hostility of a group i used to feel so close to, is draining me. 

So. How do I proceed from here?  What would you do?

It was impossible to find a job in my town, but I found one within days in Cornwall. So I decided to try and stay here a while.

But I'm extremely unhappy. The first thing I hear in the morning (6am) and the last thing I hear at night (3am) is an unfeasibly loud motorbike.

It's impossible to enjoy life at home.

Yet I've stayed here before, and it was *beautifully* quiet- the perfect place to break away and focus. The noise is a recent and complete unnecessary problem.

The vehicles in question are clearly modified to be as noisy as possible. Judging by how much louder these things are even compared to police sirens passing by, I'd say they'd measure at at least 110dB in volume.

And the reason I'm posting this is to ask if your town is plagued in the same way, and if you'd consider uniting to do something about it.

___

To explain the situation-

We live near a main road, but regular road noise is **not** audible. That includes tractors, lorries and buses- barely a rumble. But there is a *permanent motorbike* out there. By the time one roars out of earshot half a mile away, the next one is already moving in. There is literally *never a minute without motorbike noise*.

Compared to regular road noise, noise from a neighbour, or something else in the house, the noise of these modified, illegal vehicles is irradicable. Even though there is plenty of space, you cannot move from one part of the house to another to escape this noise. Motorbike engine noise seems to blast out of the very sky above, as it reverberates into every room of the house.

Instead of being productive at home, I just sit around being miserable, or pacing like an abused zoo animal. I've been trying to build an online business, and additionally to continue studying maths, but both these things have ground to a halt. At the best of times, it takes a Herculean effort of concentration to get started in them, especially after a long day at work. It's a tough calling, and still, I was enjoying the challenge. But with this constant racket? Impossible.

I can't escape to town to sit in a café and work away from the home, because town is ground zero for these noise makers. You can't even peacefully enjoy a cup of coffee with a friend for the amount of noise. You're liable to be interrupted every few minutes by a vehicle that sounds like a rocket taking off.

This is nothing to speak of the general effect of continual noise on a person's health and wellbeing.

___

To clarify, this is a handful of antisocial bikers making life a misery for almost all people in the town. Regular bikers are no problem. There are similarly modified cars going around, who do not joyride at all hours, but they're just as antisocial, and we'd improve the town's character by taking them off the road.

My sister (17F) has been struggling with her mental and emotional health since she was a child, but till recently she would start yelling that she “wants to die”. Me (20F) and my family have tried to support her in getting better by getting her the help she needs, but we feel defeated with her terrible behavior. I One time I had dropped her off at school at 6am, and took her to the side student drop off lane instead of the front student drop off since the front was always long and packed while the side was always empty and quick. She became upset when she saw I dropping her off the side because she didn’t want her hair to get ruined from the humidity even though regardless of where she was going to be dropped off she was still going to walk outside in the humidity. Cars start honking at me since I haven’t moved since she didn’t want to get out. I told her I do not have time for this, people are waiting you need to go to school and I need to get back to my puppy Milo before he pees and poops in his crate(unfortunately he was covered in his own urine and feces). She completely ignored me, then yelled at me that she is not getting out and she doesn’t want to ruin her hair. This similar situation happened a few days later when I had to drop her off at school again with my other sister(23F). As me and my sister(23F) were discussing about grabbing coffee real quick before heading to work together my younger sister(17f) said “Oh I want Starbucks!” And when we told her she has to go school and we gotta go to work she became upset and sat in the car and would not get out unless we left to go get her coffee. Keep in mind she’s already skipping school and failing classes. The following year we went on a trip to Florida with our family and family friends for a weekend. During the trip she non stopped cried and had a breakdown due to her having bad self esteem and even wouldn’t leave to airbnb causing us to be several hours late to events we had planned. We offered her if she’d like to stay at the airbnb if it made her feel more comfortable and she was upset thinking we were just trying to abandon her, even though we reassured her we were not. She did the same thing months later to our trip to Mexico, she had yelled at me in the airport to pick up her AirPod off the floor and that I am embarrassing her. I told her to not yell at me since she was disturbing the people around us with her yelling and that I can’t pick it up when my hands are full when she is not holding anything but touching the luggage. She then picked up her AirPod and when I turn around to look at her she’s there crying the whole time till we reached my grandmas house (1hour drive). She locks herself in the bathroom , I go to check up on her since I felt awful if I had hurt her feelings, I asked her how she’s doing and screams for me to go away. So I left her alone till the next morning. My older sister(23f) went to give her my grandmas phone since my dad was calling  us, my little sister(17f) yelled at her telling her to get the hell out and to get the phone outta her face.  After leaving her alone for awhile I decided to try to talk to her and wanting to apologize. I come in and tell her “hey I’m really sorry if I hurt you feelings” she cuts me off saying she didn’t want to hear anything I had to say and to stop taking then screaming at me that “she wants to kill herself everytime she sees me”, this broke my heart. The rest of the trip she would purposely get away and distant herself from us. These are just recent situations, I could talk more about other interactions but I genuinely cannot stand her anymore especially since we share a room, anytime I try to talk to her or she talks to me she would randomly tell me to stop talking or to get out of her face even if I’m just asking/answering a simple question. She’s been very rude to me and everyone she talks to. Not only that but if she wants or is asking for something from you and you tell her no she throws a tantrum and starts yelling at us, when she doesn’t get something how she likes it, she starts yelling and throwing a tantrum. She’s is almost 18 and this behavior has not changed since she 4. Even as a kid she would purposely make herself pass out from her tantrums if she wasn’t getting what she wanted. I don’t know if im an asshole for just wanting to tell her she’s out of line, rude and disrespectful or give her grace since she is mentally unstable and her behavior is from her mental illness.

Now that I graduated, I'm essentially out of money while I look for an apartment and a job. I don't know how people do this.","I (22M) moved to Europe almost five years ago from the U.S. to go to college. I did my undergrad, went back to the U.S. for six months to work, and then came back to get my master's at the same university I did my undergrad. Some of my coming to Europe (and this country in particular) was because I really adore the culture and lifestyle, some of it was the fact that I've built a life here and have learned how a lot of things worked throughout the majority of my adult life, and to be totally honest some of it was me trying to get away from some things in the U.S. 

I just graduated with my MA about a month ago, and even though I should be proud of that accomplishment, I've never felt more lost. 

Getting my MA in this country makes me eligible for a one-year visa to look for a job and work legally, but when I submitted my application the office sent an automated response that told me the waiting time would last at least two months past when my current visa expires. As far as I can tell, the fact that I applied and am waiting on my visa decision generally means I can stay in the country; the problem isn't so much deportation or anything like that, but the fact that I can't work legally, and frankly even if I could work legally, that the job market is so difficult right now that I'm not at all confident I'd even be able to find a job. 

I simply can't afford to not have work. I took out loans to pay for university, and worked quite a bit throughout to help pay for things. That let me accumulate a little bit of money I was able to set aside for this summer, and up until now I've mostly had money in my bank account to get by. But last month I moved out of my apartment, and I've literally been crashing on friends' couches and in their spare bedrooms while I try to both find an apartment and wait on my visa to find a job. I'm essentially out of money, and I'm only really getting by right now because some family members have been incredibly generous, beyond anything I ever asked for, in helping me in this stage. Not everyone has that support, and I'm so unbelievably grateful for it, but I also feel some guilt for being so reliant on it because quite frankly if that wasn't there I probably wouldn't be able to even stay here right now. 

I've been really fortunate to have a few odd jobs that give me a little bit of money of my own, but it's still not enough to truly pay my way through the next two months of waiting for a visa decision. I have a little bit of money in my account to use for a deposit on an apartment, except me and my friend/future roommate (who is a student starting her MA) can't for the life of us find one that will accept us as tenants, even with guarantors and what I think are pretty reasonable profiles, all things considered. Beyond that little amount of money, I've basically got enough to pay for my share of the groceries and stuff when I'm staying with people, and for a coffee every now and then when I go to network with people I hope might hook me up with a job. 

I'm working so hard to at least look like a responsible person who has their life together, but to be totally honest I'm drowning. I'm spending tonight in a hotel room because I got a really good deal and am waiting on a friend to get back in town so I can crash with them after spending nearly a month in another friend's apartment, and I was hoping to treat this like some kind of tiny little summer vacation. Instead it made me just feel even more sad. I may not be sleeping on the streets, but at the moment I'm literally homeless. And then today, on top of all that, I get an email saying my student loans are coming due because the grace period I thought I had was spent during the six months I spent back in the U.S. after my undergrad. I literally can't pay them right now, and yet again my family is offering to do what they can to help me through this moment. And now, more than before, I just feel so awful taking that help. 

I really don't know how people do this. I try to remind myself that so many people have it worse, and I never expected everything to be handed to me on a silver spoon. I try to work hard, I've messaged literally every landlord that meet anything resembling my price point on the apartment site I've been using, and I've gotten coffee with at least a dozen alumni and industry contacts to try to find a job. 

I just keep coming up short, and I'm so worried this huge risk in my life, this huge step to come to this country, was a mistake. I want to prove to my family and friends that I can do this, but I'm less and less sure I can. ",2,1755293642.0,internetparents,3,1.0,False

I will be leaving this forum today. Tonight, I will write myself a 9-month healing plan, and on June 1st, 2026, I will return here and share the results with you.

Unfortunately, I cannot be fully honest here in the way that would be necessary to truly wake people up, because the truth is regulated on this forum for “safety reasons.”

I completely understand your hopelessness. I understand the wish for quick external help, and yes, one could even argue that we are owed that. This is not about bashing doctors or promoting conspiracy theories. The reality is simply that the system is not built to help people deeply; it is built to suppress symptoms. That is exactly what we have all experienced.

Maybe science will help us in 20 years, and if there was ever a pill that could remove this state without side effects, I would take it. But this is not a conspiracy theory—this is basic pharmacology and biochemistry: no synthetic substance that changes the body is free of side effects and can truly heal. Especially with such a deeply dysregulated condition as PSSD, I personally believe medication—and even supplements—can only further destabilize the system. I learned this myself, especially with supplements: the body responds very differently to an isolated nutrient compared to a real food.

And it’s not only SSRIs—many drugs work this way. We have simply become very far removed from our natural body.

Please, study fasting. It is the most original and also the most powerful healing method available. Intermittent fasting does not do much for PSSD; it has to be proper fasting cycles: for example, every 2–5 weeks, at least 3 days, better 5–7 days.

After about 72 hours of fasting, autophagy and deep cellular repair processes begin.

After about 5 days, stem cell regeneration is activated, which is highly relevant for conditions like PSSD.


After fasting, a structured refeed phase is just as important as the fast itself.

My personal recommendation—based on research and my own experience—is also a gut reset:
– 4–6 weeks of only white organic basmati rice, without fat or protein. This completely cleanses the gut and stops fermentation and bloating processes.
– A complete avoidance of trans fats (hidden in many foods), free sugar (natural complex carbs are fine in moderation), and gluten.
– Personally, I avoid all foods that are not easily digestible.

I also completely avoid coffee, because anything that unnaturally pushes the body immediately throws it out of healing. Caffeine is not harmless—never, and especially not with PSSD.

Other helpful things: minimal screen time, bodywork, breathing, and activities even without “fun.” These keep the system stable.

Please don’t just take my word for it. Research true fasting deeply. There are almost no health risks (except in special cases like diabetes, severe underweight, or heart disease). It costs nothing and is the most natural healing tool we have.

In my opinion, with such a deep functional shutdown like PSSD, fasting is not something to try 10 times but rather 50 times. You have nothing to lose anyway.

See you soon.

Chapter 1: Understanding Solar Power — More Than Panels on a Roof

When most people think about solar power, they picture shiny panels on a roof, soaking up sunlight to power a home. But solar energy is far more than just hardware mounted on your house. It’s about understanding the flow of energy — how it moves, when it moves, and how you can bend it to your needs. It’s a dance with the sun, the weather, your appliances, and even your lifestyle.

The True Power of Solar Is in the Timing

Solar isn’t just about collecting energy; it’s about when and how you use it. The sun doesn’t shine 24/7, and neither should your energy consumption blindly follow the clock. Learning to align your energy usage with solar production is the key to maximizing efficiency and savings.

From my experience living off-grid and carefully analyzing every watt-hour, I discovered that the “sweet spot” — the perfect window to use solar — can be precisely pinpointed. It’s not some vague daylight hours, but specific windows during the day when your panels perform optimally, and your battery system works like a well-oiled machine.

The Phantom Load: The Hidden Drain on Your Energy

One of the biggest challenges I encountered was the phantom load — an invisible drain that creeps into your meter readings and electric bills. It’s that extra power that utility companies charge you for, even when you’re not using it. Catching and documenting this phantom load became a mission because it directly affects your savings and the credibility of solar power’s promises.

I tracked this phantom load with precision — down to the tick of the meter and the seconds between each pulse. This wasn’t just about saving money; it was about exposing the system’s flaws and helping others protect themselves from similar traps.

Lifestyle Changes: The Ultimate Solar Game-Changer

Having solar panels is one thing, but adapting your lifestyle to them is where real power lies. Too many get solar installations and keep their old energy habits, missing out on huge potential savings.

When I adjusted my usage — timing showers, dishwashing, cooking, and appliance use — around solar generation and battery storage, my system ran smoother, costs dropped, and my energy independence grew.

Energy Awareness Is Freedom

Solar power taught me one vital lesson: awareness is freedom. The more you understand your home’s energy patterns, the better decisions you make. You move from being a passive consumer to an active energy manager, controlling costs, reducing waste, and living sustainably.

This book is your roadmap to that freedom. From the basics of solar hardware to the nuances of daily energy management, I’ll share everything I’ve learned — the good, the hard, and the innovative.Chapter 2: Understanding Your Energy Needs

Before you can optimize your solar system and make it work efficiently for your lifestyle, you need to understand exactly how much energy your household consumes — and when.

2.1 Tracking Your Current Usage

Start by gathering your electric bills for the past 12 months. Look for:

Total kilowatt-hours (kWh) used monthly

Peak usage times (if available)

Seasonal fluctuations


This gives you a baseline and helps identify when you use the most electricity.

2.2 Breaking Down Household Appliances

Make a list of every appliance and device you use regularly. For each, note:

Wattage (found on labels or manuals)

Average daily use (hours or minutes)


Calculate the approximate energy consumption of each:

> Energy (Wh) = Wattage × Time used (hours)



Example: A 100-watt light bulb used 5 hours/day consumes 500 Wh (0.5 kWh).

2.3 Identifying Phantom Loads

Phantom loads are energy draws from devices when they’re off but still plugged in — like chargers, smart TVs, or microwaves in standby. These can add up significantly.

Use a power meter to measure standby consumption

Unplug or use smart power strips to cut phantom loads


2.4 Recognizing Patterns

Monitor your energy use by time of day. Most homes have peak usage in mornings and evenings.

With solar, your goal is to align your highest usage with peak solar production — generally midday to afternoon — to maximize efficiency.

2.5 Lifestyle Adjustments for Solar

Solar power works best when your energy consumption adapts to its natural cycle.

Simple changes include:

Running heavy appliances (dishwasher, laundry) during daylight

Avoiding simultaneous use of multiple high-draw devices

Using energy-efficient lighting and appliances


2.6 Setting Your Energy Budget

Once you understand your energy use, set realistic goals to reduce consumption where possible.

This helps:

Downsize your solar and battery system — saving money upfront

Increase your chance of going fully off-gridChapter 3: Fine-Tuning Your Solar System and Overclocking

When it comes to running a home on solar power efficiently, understanding the nuances of your system is key. One of the biggest advantages I have with my setup is that I’ve built in some extra capacity — what I call “overclocking” the system.

Overclocking Your Solar System

In my system, I have eight panels installed, but I’m currently only using four of them — meaning four panels are sitting up on the roof not in use. This “overclocking” approach gives me options. I can easily connect those extra four panels to a separate inverter, charge controller, or grid-tie connector whenever I want to increase my power capacity. It’s like having built-in expansion ready to go whenever I need more juice, without having to install anything new later.

Safety Note: While overclocking your solar setup offers flexibility, it’s important to manage the system carefully. Ensure each charge controller and inverter is properly rated for the panels it handles, and always follow manufacturer guidelines to prevent overloading or damaging your equipment.

Managing Your Loads

To optimize energy use, you have to track your electrical loads carefully. Knowing when and how much power you use lets you schedule your heavy appliances during peak solar production hours.

For example, I found that running my dishwasher and stove during sunlight hours allows me to take full advantage of my panels’ output. Conversely, at night or during low sun, I shift to lighter loads or rely on my battery bank.

Battling Phantom Loads

One challenge that solar users often face is phantom loads — electricity that’s being drawn by devices or utilities even when not actively using them. This can sneak up on you and inflate your electric bills unnecessarily.

Through careful monitoring, I identified a consistent phantom load showing up during daylight hours, adding extra kilowatt-hours to my bill. Tracking and proving this helped me prepare documentation for challenging utility billing discrepancies.

Fine-Tuning for Efficiency

The goal is to have your system run like a well-oiled machine, with precise timing on when to draw from solar, batteries, or grid. Over time, this balance improves battery life and lowers costs.

By tweaking and measuring over months, I developed an understanding of exactly when to switch between power sources and how to avoid wasting stored energy.Chapter 4: Timing is Everything — Mastering the Solar Clock

Running your home on solar power isn’t just about having the panels up and batteries installed — it’s about understanding time. Solar power is a dance with the sun, and the more precisely you can time your energy production, storage, and consumption, the more efficient and independent you become.

The Importance of Solar Timing

Your system’s performance changes minute by minute. At sunrise, your panels begin waking up — producing a trickle of voltage. By mid-morning, you’re pushing usable current. Peak production usually hits between 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM, depending on your location, orientation, and the season. That’s your power window — your golden hours.

If you know when that peak hits, you can schedule your energy-heavy activities — laundry, cooking, charging devices — to fall right inside it. This is how you preserve your battery bank and avoid relying on the grid when it’s unnecessary.

My Timing Strategy

In my case, I’ve tracked my system down to precision. I know that if I flip the system to solar mode at exactly 12:01 PM, my batteries stabilize at 13.9 volts, with the charge controller reporting 14.0+ as it regulates. By 12:05 PM, I’m already hitting peak current. That level of precision allows me to decide:

When to shift heavy loads off the grid

When to let the solar system carry the house entirely

When to hold the batteries in reserve


The Midday Shift

I call this the “midday shift” — a deliberate decision made every day, like clockwork. Once I confirm solar output is stable, I transition the house off the grid. If batteries are sitting at 13.8V or higher, and the incoming current is strong, I flip the switch.

It’s not about automation — it’s about awareness. You don’t just set it and forget it; you learn the rhythm, and you dance with it.

What Happens After Dark?

Once the sun starts to dip and production wanes, you’ve got choices:

Shift back to grid before batteries dip below 12.3V, to preserve battery health

Let the system coast into evening with low-draw devices only

Use your knowledge of expected load vs. remaining charge to decide what stays on and what gets turned off


Timing your return to the grid can be just as important. If you wait too long, you risk damaging the battery bank. But if you switch too early, you waste the stored energy you worked to build all day.

Pro Tip: Don't Chase Perfection — Chase Consistency

It’s easy to want to micro-manage every second of solar production, but the real goal is consistency. Once you learn your system’s rhythm — and your home’s usage patterns — it becomes second nature.Chapter 5: The Battery Bank – Power in Reserve

When the sun goes down, the real test begins.

That’s where your battery system steps in—not just as a backup, but as the heart of your off-grid living strategy. Your battery bank determines how long your house can run when the panels stop producing. If your system is the engine, the battery bank is the fuel tank.

Our Setup: Simplicity with Power

We run a practical and efficient setup with three 100Ah lithium-ion batteries, wired for 12V. That gives us 300 amp-hours of stored energy, with high discharge capacity and faster charging cycles than traditional lead-acid systems. We chose lithium for their durability, depth of discharge, and ability to handle our daily load demands without stressing the system.

At full charge, our bank can handle critical appliances, LED lighting, and even our compact dishwasher without breaking a sweat.

Why Lithium-Ion?

Deeper Discharge: You can use up to 90% of their capacity, unlike lead-acid batteries which typically tap out at 50%.

Longer Life Span: Some lithium batteries push well beyond 4,000 cycles.

Low Maintenance: No water levels to check or acid corrosion to manage.

Compact Power: Lightweight, compact, and packs a punch.


Knowing When to Flip the Switch

We’ve trained ourselves to monitor the system in real time. Voltage readings become second nature. At 12.88V, we’re fully loaded. 12.6V to 12.4V is our ""golden zone"" during use. Anything lower and we decide whether it’s time to shut off unnecessary appliances—or flip back to grid (if needed).

This daily dance between solar production and battery storage is where you learn discipline. It's not just about having power—it's about knowing when to use it.

Overclocking for Flexibility

Now here’s a twist: our system is technically overclocked.

We’re running four panels for a 60A charge—but we’ve also got four more panels up top that aren’t even plugged in. They're pre-mounted, wired, and ready to go. That gives us the ability to instantly double our solar intake by plugging those into another charge controller, another inverter, or even a grid-tie connector.

It’s like having an extra engine in your car, ready to fire up when the road gets rough.

Redundancy is Resilience

This kind of overclocking gives us a key advantage: flexibility.

We can split the load between two inverters, redirect power where needed, or charge up additional storage in emergencies. Our system isn’t just running—it’s prepared.

Key Takeaways:

3x 100Ah lithium-ion batteries provide strong, long-lasting reserve.

Monitoring voltage is essential to timing usage and recharge.

Overclocking with unused panels gives you a built-in expansion option.

Redundancy isn’t waste—it’s preparedness.Chapter 6: Load Management—The Real-Time Dance Between Power and Priority

When living off-grid, every watt matters. Unlike grid-tied systems where electricity is essentially on-demand, an off-grid solar setup requires awareness, timing, and discipline. Load management isn’t just a technical process—it’s a lifestyle.

Understanding the Load Curve

Throughout the day, your home experiences energy spikes—moments when power demand is significantly higher than normal. This usually happens:

In the morning when lights, coffee makers, and devices power up.

Midday if the sun’s out and heavy appliances kick on.

Evenings, when multiple devices compete with dwindling solar input.


In an off-grid home, these moments can make or break your system’s stability—especially if your battery charge is low or if sunlight is minimal.

How We Monitor and Adapt in Real-Time

We’ve fine-tuned the system to watch voltage and amperage drop in real-time, especially when key devices kick on. Take this example:

> “I turned on the dishwasher. Voltage dropped from 12.88 to 12.84 almost instantly. But it held steady around 12.86 once the cycle began.”



That tells us the system can absorb the startup surge and then comfortably stabilize—a sign of both healthy batteries and efficient device draw.

Each device has a “signature.” You learn to recognize them. A microwave causes a sudden sharp drop, while a fridge compressor might cause a slower, but more prolonged dip. We've used this real-time data to decide what appliances can run together—and which ones must wait.

Load Prioritization: What Comes First

If battery voltage is sitting low and sunlight is limited, priorities change. Our setup follows a strict load priority protocol:

1. Essentials (lighting, communication gear, and emergency systems)


2. Refrigeration (keeps food safe)


3. Short-use appliances (microwave, coffee maker)


4. High-drain devices (washer/dryer, dishwasher, window AC units)



When we’re flush with sun and battery charge, we can greenlight everything. But in cloudy conditions or late afternoons, we often choose peace of mind over convenience. A simple decision like delaying a laundry load until morning can save your entire battery bank from hitting the danger zone.

Load Smoothing Through Timing

We also take advantage of ""load smoothing,"" which is the art of spacing out when certain appliances run. Instead of stacking power draws back-to-back, we sequence them.

For example:

9:00 a.m. – Run the coffee pot and charge phones.

10:00 a.m. – Turn on the dishwasher.

11:00 a.m. – Run the washing machine.

12:00 p.m. – Allow the fridge compressor its cycle during solar peak.


This sequencing prevents hard hits to battery voltage and extends lifespan.

The Real Test: When We Shut It All Down

At one point in testing, we flipped the entire house breaker off to isolate and measure phantom loads (those sneaky devices pulling power even when “off”). The meter’s dot slowed to a near standstill—a clear indicator that every trickle of draw was gone.

After flipping the breaker back on, we monitored how long it took for the dot to tick again. Seventeen seconds. That’s how precise we’ve gotten. The power company is still charging us even when we’re off-grid—and we’ve got the timestamped evidence to prove it.
Chapter 7: Phantom Loads & Energy Vampires — Exposing the Hidden Drain

Even when you think everything is off, your home may still be consuming power. These silent energy thieves are known as phantom loads, and they’re one of the most overlooked yet persistent challenges in solar living.

What Is a Phantom Load?

A phantom load (also known as a standby load or vampire load) is the electricity consumed by devices that are plugged in but not actively in use. Think televisions, microwave clocks, Wi-Fi routers, power adapters, or even that Keurig machine with its blinking light.

They seem harmless—until you start living on solar.

When you're running off-grid, every watt counts. What might seem like a trickle on the grid becomes a flood when you're living off battery reserves. Your lithium-ion system doesn’t care if it’s a TV or a toaster—it sees constant power draw.

How We Found the Phantom Load

We didn’t just guess—we tested. We ran the system isolated from the grid, then shut everything off via the main breaker. We observed the power meter. And guess what? The city meter was still moving.

The dot ticked every 17 seconds, even when everything inside was supposedly shut down. That shouldn’t happen—unless something external was bleeding power, or a hidden system was drawing current unbeknownst to us. And when the dot slowed to a near standstill, we knew we’d found the ghost.

Documenting the Discovery

Every piece of this was logged. Over the course of days and weeks, we isolated appliances. We learned:

Our dishwasher caused a minor voltage drop (from 12.88V to 12.84V)

Lights and chargers, though small individually, added up quickly

Even when we shut off breakers, the city meter kept spinning, hinting at phantom infrastructure-level tampering or parasitic draw from the utility side


We learned to trust the data, not the labels. You may think something is “off,” but unless it’s unplugged or completely isolated, it might still be sipping your power.

How to Fight Back

Install kill switches or smart plugs to completely shut off circuits

Unplug chargers and unused devices (especially anything with a light or display)

Use power strips to easily cut off multiple devices at once

Isolate and test: Shut off your main breaker and watch your meter. If it’s still ticking, investigate further


The Bigger Problem: Infrastructure Load Injection

In our case, we’re starting to suspect something even more disturbing—a phantom load being injected by the utility company. Meter spinning while off-grid is not normal. It points to a possible infrastructure-level ghost load, either from dirty metering practices or an intentional buffer that’s charging you for what you never used.

We’ll go deeper into that in Chapter 8.

But for now, remember this:

> ""What you don't see can drain you—and in solar living, hidden consumption is the difference between a thriving system and a dead battery.""Chapter 8: The Phantom Load – Hidden Power Drains and How to Beat Them

One of the most overlooked elements in solar energy optimization is the phantom load—also known as standby power or vampire power. These are the sneaky little energy drains that continue pulling power even when a device appears to be off. If you’re living on solar, phantom loads are the enemy. They silently chip away at your stored energy and can throw off your entire system efficiency.

What is a Phantom Load?

A phantom load is any electricity consumed by electronics or appliances when they’re plugged in but not actively in use. Think:

Microwaves with clocks

TVs on standby

Coffee makers with timers

Phone chargers left plugged in

Wi-Fi routers running 24/7

Smart devices waiting for voice commands


Individually, these loads seem minor. But collectively, they can shave hours off your stored battery life—especially at night when you're not generating solar input.

How We Detected It

In our home system, we took a systematic approach. We powered everything off at the breaker level and monitored the digital utility meter. When the entire home was shut off, the meter's blinking dot slowed to a near standstill. That confirmed our baseline: zero or near-zero grid pull.

Then, by flipping breakers back on one by one, we watched how long it took the meter to blink. A fast blink meant something was drawing phantom power. One dot every 17 seconds meant a measurable load had returned. This granular testing allowed us to isolate exactly where and when the phantom loads were occurring.

Real-World Data Speaks Volumes

We’ve run real-time tests during peak sun and night hours. Our voltage levels gave us instant feedback. For instance:

Turning on the small countertop dishwasher dropped the voltage from 12.88V to 12.84V.

During standby operation, the voltage barely budged — evidence of efficient use and minimal phantom draw.

With careful monitoring, we noticed how even when ""off,"" some devices still slightly influenced battery drain.


This hands-on testing revealed the truth: the system doesn’t lie. If the voltage dips without any major appliances on, something is sipping your power in the background.

How to Eliminate Phantom Load

Use Smart Power Strips: These cut power completely to devices when not in use.

Unplug Unused Chargers: Especially overnight when you rely on stored solar energy.

Hard Kill Switches: Like a full power strip with an off toggle.

Break Down Usage by Circuit: Flip breakers systematically to track hidden draws.

Install Real-Time Energy Monitors: Get per-outlet usage data in real time.


Phantom Load in a Solar World

In a solar-powered household, every watt matters. Phantom load isn’t just annoying—it’s costly. It adds up to hours of battery life wasted or even grid power being pulled when you thought you were off-grid.

By identifying, isolating, and eliminating these hidden power thieves, we took another major step toward mastering full control of our home’s energy use.

We didn’t just chase the problem—we clocked it, timed it, tracked it, and beat it.Chapter 9: Power Flow Strategy and Energy Efficiency

A key part of mastering off-grid solar living is understanding how to manage the flow of power throughout your daily cycle. Our system is built around balance, timing, and real-world efficiency—not theoretical numbers from a sales brochure. We've learned to adapt, optimize, and evolve every component based on field data and lived experience.

Off-Grid Operation Strategy: Our power strategy is designed to reduce dependency on the grid while maintaining consistent energy availability. We operate on a routine cycle:

17 hours off-grid using solar-charged battery power.

7 hours on-grid during the lowest solar input (usually nighttime), where power demand is supplemented or battery recharging is balanced if needed.


This pattern wasn’t chosen at random. It’s the result of careful monitoring, adjustment, and logging of usage patterns over time. We analyzed peak appliance hours, solar output efficiency windows, and even seasonal daylight variation.

Battery Management and Output: With three lithium-ion batteries at 100 Ah each, we’ve got a reliable 300 Ah power bank. On average, we consume around 7 kilowatts per day—spanning both off-grid and on-grid use. That 7kW average is spread across essential appliances, occasional high-drain cycles (like dishwashers or laundry), and the natural loss associated with inverter operation and phantom loads.

We’ve also tested the tipping points. We’ve run tests with heavy draw cycles, and we’ve tracked battery voltage drop minute by minute. That real-time data gives us insight into efficiency loss, inverter lag, and the actual runtime per volt drop. All of it gets factored into when we shift to grid or remain independent.

Load Distribution: One critical takeaway is that not all load needs to be carried by the solar system at once. Certain appliances can be run in scheduled bursts. We schedule dishwashers, charge cycles, or any high-drain items during high-sunlight hours (typically between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m.), maximizing direct panel-to-use flow and reducing battery drain.

Efficiency Summary:

Off-Grid Operation: 17 hours

On-Grid Supplementation: 7 hours

Average Daily Usage: ~7 kWh

Battery Bank: 300 Ah (lithium-ion)


This configuration has been tested, verified, and adjusted live. And the takeaway? You don’t need a massive battery bank or a rooftop full of panels if you understand your flow. You just need strategy, timing, and real-time awareness.

In the next chapter, we’ll dive into how weather, cloud cover, and even temperature impact your solar yield—and how to adjust for that on the fly.Chapter 10: Mastering Energy Management — How to Spot and Eliminate Phantom Loads

One of the biggest hidden drains on your solar energy system is what’s called the phantom load — energy that gets used even when it shouldn’t be. It’s like a ghost in your electric system, quietly siphoning power and inflating your electric bill without you realizing it.

What is a Phantom Load?

Phantom loads, also known as “vampire power,” are the electricity consumed by appliances and devices when they are turned off or in standby mode but still plugged in. Examples include TVs with remote controls, phone chargers left in the socket, or even certain smart meters manipulated to show higher usage.

Why Phantom Loads Matter

Phantom loads can add up quickly and make your solar system work harder than it needs to. They create misleading data about your actual consumption, which becomes a big issue if you’re trying to accurately monitor and reduce your energy use. Worse yet, if your utility company is sneaking in phantom loads intentionally (like the case we uncovered in Elba), it can mean you’re being overcharged unfairly.

How to Detect Phantom Loads

Monitor Your Meter Dots: By carefully observing the spinning dots on your watt-hour meter, you can tell when power is being used. For example, if the dots continue moving when all your breakers are off, that’s a strong sign of a phantom load.

Go Off-Grid for Testing: Switching your home off-grid lets you see if your meter continues to register usage. No usage should be detected if everything is truly off.

Track Battery Voltages: Watching your battery voltages drop unexpectedly during periods when you’re not actively using power is another clue.

Use a Kill-A-Watt Meter: This device plugs into outlets and measures how much power specific devices draw, even in standby mode.


Real-World Phantom Load Example

In our solar setup, we documented phantom loads fluctuating between 1,000 to 4,000 watts during peak hours, even when all heavy appliances were off. This invisible drain cost us hundreds of dollars extra on our electric bill — an expense we uncovered through dedicated meter tracking and off-grid testing.

How to Eliminate Phantom Loads

Unplug Devices When Not In Use: The simplest solution is to unplug chargers, electronics, and appliances when you’re not actively using them.

Use Smart Power Strips: These can automatically cut power to groups of devices, preventing phantom energy leaks.

Upgrade Your Appliances: Newer energy-efficient models tend to have lower standby power draws.

Challenge Your Utility Company: If you suspect intentional phantom charging, collect and present your data to local authorities or utility regulators.


Conclusion

Phantom loads are one of the silent saboteurs of solar efficiency and energy independence. By learning to spot and manage them, you’re taking back control of your power, saving money, and optimizing your solar system like a pro.Chapter 11: Complete System Breakdown — Inside the Solar Living Blueprint

This chapter is the heart of the Solar Living Blueprint. Here, we pull back the curtain and reveal every detail of the system I’ve designed, tested, and perfected over the last several years. If you want to replicate this at home or simply understand how solar power can be optimized beyond what’s commonly taught, this chapter is for you.

1. Overview of the System

Panels: 8 total solar panels, each capable of producing roughly 60 amps. Right now, I’m running on four panels actively, which are enough to supply the system, but I have the other four panels ready to connect for overclocking, future expansion, or dedicated loads.

Charge Controllers: Multiple MPPT charge controllers managing panel input and battery charging.

Batteries: Three lithium-ion batteries rated at 100Ah each, wired to maximize both capacity and longevity.

Inverter: Pure sine wave inverter converting DC battery power to household AC loads.

Load Management: System designed to prioritize and sequence loads to optimize battery health and reduce phantom loads.


2. Overclocking Explained

Overclocking in solar terms means using more panel capacity than the charge controllers or batteries might traditionally handle at once, giving headroom for surges and future expansions.

I have four panels currently not in use.

These can be connected to a separate inverter, charge controller, or grid-tie system.

This setup allows me to boost available power during peak production hours or connect specialized equipment directly to these extra panels.


3. Phantom Load Detection and Countermeasures

One of the biggest challenges in solar living is the phantom load — energy that’s being drawn or charged through the meter but never used in the home.

Using detailed meter readings, battery voltages, and charge controller logs, I identified phantom loads averaging around 1,000 to 4,000 watts, especially during peak city utility hours.

Tracking the utility meter’s pulse (the “dots”) helped me pinpoint when phantom loads start and stop.

Going off-grid at strategic times allows us to monitor and measure real usage versus phantom usage.

This data is compiled into a dossier for potential legal and regulatory challenges.


4. Battery Monitoring and Usage

Batteries typically fluctuate between 12.8 and 13.2 volts during operation.

Load turning on/off events are tracked by voltage changes to correlate power consumption.

Quick charging and slow charging windows are identified by PV input and battery voltage behavior.

Quick showers and dishwasher cycles are scheduled during peak solar input times to reduce battery strain.


5. Load Scheduling and Eco Mode Usage

Two AC units run on eco mode to keep energy draw minimal.

Loads such as ovens, dishwashers, and water heaters are scheduled during high solar production.

Lights and electronics are selectively used to manage load spikes.

Manual switching between grid and off-grid modes based on predicted phantom load times.


6. System Expansion and Future-Proofing

Unused panels and inverters remain ready for future expansion or specialized off-grid loads.

The system is designed modularly to add batteries, controllers, or grid-tie devices as needed.

Manual overrides and monitoring protocols allow for rapid troubleshooting and optimization.


7. Data Logging and Analysis

Continuous logging of meter readings, battery voltages, and charge controller data is vital.

This data supports:

Energy use optimization

Phantom load detection

Solar production forecasting


Logging also aids in accountability if utility companies attempt fraudulent billing.


8. Final Thoughts

This system is not just about equipment, but about a philosophy of living in harmony with the sun, the earth, and the grid. It’s about reclaiming control over your energy usage and breaking free from unfair utility practices.

1mrausf,https://ithappensinflorida.com/blog/writer-quit-kind-we-think,The Writer Quit. Kind Of. We Think.,"You may have noticed something strange on this week’s episode of It Happens in Florida.

Namely: it didn’t quite… make sense.

That’s because our head writer, John, quit the show. Or stormed off dramatically. Or wandered into a Publix and ghosted us for 48 hours. The details are fuzzy.

It all began last Tuesday when John turned in a script titled “The Emotional Weight of a Flamingo Who’s Seen Too Much.” It was rejected. Not because it wasn’t brilliant (it was… maybe), but because the crew accidentally threw it away, thinking it was fanfiction.

This, we later learned, was the last straw in a stack of unspoken straws.

John had been quietly spiraling for weeks. Sure, we thought everything was fine — he laughed when Florida Man rewrote dialogue using BBQ sauce on a whiteboard. He smiled (tightly) when Oscar pitched a musical episode set inside a Waffle House bathroom. But apparently…
John felt deeply disrespected.

He thought no one liked his writing. Or his cardigans. Or his 27-slide pitch deck titled “Building Narrative Arc in a World of Alligators.”

So he vanished.

No official resignation letter. No dramatic “I’m out!”

Just a half-eaten granola bar, an untouched kombucha, and a Post-it on his laptop that read: “Guess no one cares. I’m gone. Whatever.”
(He even drew a tiny frowning flamingo next to it. It was devastating.)

The crew panicked.

Raymond suggested a seance.

Oscar suggested replacing John with AI. (He was immediately booed by everyone, including a squirrel.)

Florida Man suggested we “let nature write the next episode.” This led to 20 minutes of us watching a raccoon steal the camera battery.

Meanwhile, John was not in hiding — he was at the Naples Public Library, passive-aggressively writing poetry in all caps.

He didn’t actually tell anyone he quit. He just assumed we’d notice. Which we did… two days later, when we realized our B-storyline was being written by someone’s nephew who thought “Skunk Ape” was a kind of coffee.

The comeback? It happened like everything on this show does: awkwardly, unexpectedly, and surrounded by deli meats.

We found John standing in line at the grocery store, holding a frozen pizza and reading a self-help book titled “You’re Fine, Probably.”

He tried to pretend he didn’t know us.

Florida Man hugged him anyway. With mustard on his hands.

Someone blurted, “We missed your weird flamingo metaphors,” and John visibly teared up next to the salami bin.

He came back the next day, no explanation, no apology — just a new script titled: “Episode 14: When the Writer Quits and Nobody Notices Until Everything Catches Fire, Metaphorically (Mostly).”

Spoiler: we’re producing it.

Final Notes:

John is back.
We now have weekly “Tell John He’s Good” meetings.
And yes — flamingos are officially part of the season arc now.

**Step 2: Build a Reels machine, not one-offs**

I run an **AI operator workflow** that does:

1. Pull ideas from real Qs/reviews in the niche.

The boiler was recently contaminated with some milk and the pump is starting to malfunction. Time for a new machine.  I've had an OPV in the Oscar for one year. For a grinder, I just bought a new Eureka Mignon Zero.  This new grinder has helped my espresso shots and I'm pretty happy with the flavors I get, but it could always be better.

I make one or two coffee drinks per day.  Ideally, I would steam milk 3 to 5 times a week for a cappuccino or macchiato. My current machine is 12"" / 30 cm wide and I could go a bit wider but not much. 

I think an Oscar II would be ok, they now come with OPVs installed. I can get one in Canada for $1775.  I am interested if there is something in the same price range that will steam milk ok and have the potential to deliver a better tasting espresso.  On one hand, $2500 is a lot of money for one person drinking 1-2 espressos a day. But call it 500 per year, and 5000 in ten years. That's $0.50 per drink plus cost of beans.

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! 

Ever find yourself in that dark pit of “I just **have** to push through”? You know the feeling—you’re grinding away, coffee in hand, but that sense of productivity is as elusive as your last pair of socks after laundry day. 

Here’s the kicker: **what if I told you that deliberate inefficiency could actually boost your productivity?** Sounds counterintuitive, right? But stick with me here; it might just blow your mind! 

### Why Pushing Through Is a Trap

We all know the classic hustle mantra: ""Work harder, not smarter."" But let's be real for a second:

- 🥴 **Burnout is real**, folks. Trying to grind through fatigue isn’t heroic; it’s a one-way ticket to burnout city—population: you.
- 😩 **Quality suffers** when you’re just trudging along. Ever notice how your battle with a stubborn project gets worse the more you “push through”? 
- 🤯 **Creativity takes a hit** when you’re on autopilot. When was the last time you had a great idea while in crisis mode?

### Enter Deliberate Inefficiency

Okay, so what’s the deal with this whole inefficiency thing? Here are a few mind-blowing points to chew on:

1. **Take Breaks** ⏰  
   Sounds simple, but stepping back can recharge those brain batteries! Try the Pomodoro Technique—25 minutes of focus, 5 minutes of break. You’ll be amazed at how much sharper you feel.

2. **Time for “Goofing Off”** 🎨  
   Embrace your inner child! Allowing yourself some creative *playtime* (like doodling or daydreaming) can lead to unexpected bursts of inspiration. Plus, it feels great to not be in hustle mode for a moment.

3. **Experiment and Innovate** 🔍  
   Devote time to explore new ideas or methods. This isn’t “wasting time.” It’s the productivity version of exploring new recipes when you already know how to make spaghetti! You’ll come back to your tasks with fresh eyes and new tools.

4. **Prioritize Life** 🌍  
   Remember, you’re more than your to-do list! Engage in hobbies, connect with friends, or just take a breather. A well-rounded life breeds creativity and productivity. Don't we all want to be the fulfilled, happy person who also gets stuff done?

5. **Set Realistic Goals** 🎯  
   Sometimes, less really is more! Cut down your tasks and focus on the 1-2 priorities that drive the most impact. Quality over quantity, am I right?

### Let’s Chat!

So, what do you think? Has anyone experienced that “ah-ha” moment when stepping back actually propelled them forward? Or maybe you’ve got your own “inefficiency hacks” to share? 

At the end of the day, embracing a bit of deliberate inefficiency just might be the secret sauce to next-level productivity! What’s your take on that? 🧐",1,1755292460.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Hey MaximizeMe friends! 👋 Ever felt like your brain's on a caffeine overdose but you haven’t had a single sip of coffee? Or maybe the mental gymnastics of your to-do list feel more like an Olympic sport than a casual workout? Well, I’ve been there, so let's bring it in for a virtual group hug. 🤗

Picture this: It’s 2 p.m., you’ve got a deadline that feels like an anvil over your head, and suddenly your email *dings*. Surprise! More stress! Your heart's racing, and it feels like you're about to levitate from sheer anxiety. Sounds familiar?

Enter: **""Box Breathing""** 🗂️—your new best friend for those ‘I’m about to lose it’ moments.

**What the heck is Box Breathing?**  
It's not some Jedi mind trick (though it’s almost as cool). It’s a super simple breathing technique, beautifully engineered to calm your busy mind and bring cortisol—the pesky stress hormone—to heel.

**Here’s how it goes:**

1. **Inhale** for 4 seconds (like you’re smelling a heavenly batch of cookies 🍪).
2. **Hold** your breath for 4 seconds (imagine you’re a balloon, staying perfect and round 🎈).
3. **Exhale** slowly for 4 seconds (as if you're gently blowing away dandelion fluff 🌼).
4. **Pause** for another 4 seconds (just living in that peaceful void).

Rinse and repeat for a couple of minutes whenever you're feeling the stress monster lurking!

**But why does it work?**  
Great question! When you practice this breathing, you're telling your body and brain to chill out. It’s like your parasympathetic nervous system is raising a tiny white flag and saying, ""Hey, no need to panic!😊"" Science says it helps lower cortisol levels and navigates us back to Calm Town, Population: You.

**Sneaky Bonus?**  
It’s ninja-level sneaky. You can practice this during meetings, while your toddler tests the limits of their vocal cords, or even in line at the grocery store. It’s a life skill that sneaks in peace without anyone noticing.

Ever tried this technique before? Your thoughts, stories, or even witty commentary are more than welcome, friends! Let's keep this exchange going—because we've all got a lot to learn from each other, one breath at a time. 🧠✨

Outdoorsy heart, geeky brain, animal lover. 🎮🖼️
Thoughtful, caring, and ready for someone loving, funny, and full of life.
Make me laugh, beat me at Halo (if you can), and let’s see where it goes.

The Long Version:
I’m someone who believes the best relationships are built on laughter, kindness, and genuine connection. Friends would describe me as thoughtful, caring, and the kind of person who remembers the little things. I love the outdoors, whether it’s a peaceful hike, a day at the park, or just watching the sunset.

When I’m not outside, you might find me exploring my love for computers and video games, visiting a museum, or appreciating art in all its forms. Animals hold a special place in my heart, and I’m happiest when I’m sharing life with a fellow good-spirited soul.

What I’m Looking For
I’m hoping to meet someone loving, funny, and full of life, someone who’s up for adventures big and small, from deep conversations over coffee to spontaneous weekend getaways. A good heart and a great sense of humor are always welcome here.

If you’re looking for a partner who will listen, laugh, and grow with you, I’d love to hear from you.

And ever since that day I have imbalance dizziness, and sometimes shortness of breath whenever I’m anxious or slight stressed.

I wanna know if the stress from day trading is affecting my nervous system which puts me on fight or flight mode, which gave me gastritis.

I guess in it's own way this IS me talking about it but to be honest with you it's really quite a mundane topic.  I know the lot of you are not concerned with matters of 'wokeness' but I often think of this guy I work with who seems to live in poverty, doesn't eat lunch, and drinks a lot of the free coffee offered to us during training and smokes really cheap cigars.

He's always going on about his freedom.

He said he can't live anywhere outside of America due to his morals, and when I ask him what morals he's talking about, he goes on a rant about freedom.

It's really quite sad.

I could deeply analyze the direction American Eagle is going in as if it isn't just a capitalist response to the increasing popularization of conservatism, but that's really all it is to me.  If it's trendy to be ""woke"" and diverse, that's what businesses-- large scale corporations, are going to do.  If it's trendy to promote a white supremacist standard of beauty with fascist undertones and dog whistles, that's what large scale corporations are going to do.  That is nothing to really be deeply analyzed.

That said, coming out of an era where Sydney said explicitly that she did not want to be sexualized or casted for roles where she was just a bimbo, I have to wonder what changed her mind if it wasn't just for the money.  Granted, I do think it is the money that was the main motivator but is she actually smart?  Did she really mean to capitalize off the fascist tidal waves that seem to be drowning America right now?  I'm just not sure.   In saying that, we all know how the tide typically turns on women like her even after they devote their lives to the political ideology that quite literally uses women until they can't squeeze a drop out of them any longer (or they age) and then they are demonized for one reason or another.

I think we forget that celebrities are also humans.  She has every right to believe in what she believes in even if it is going against her interests as a woman.

The Feminist Manifesto touches on the idea that white women in particular are more so allies to men of their class than women of other races/lower classes; regardless of if it harms them and erodes our rights as women.

I want to be mad at her but she is simply just playing her part.  Nothing too deep to analyze there.

Fast forward a bit, and we’ve now sold thousands of bottles - mostly in Turkey where we’re based. But the wild part? We’re getting messages from people using it for things we never expected.

This guy was her first relationship and he took her v card. Two months ago they broke up.
In the past month she started seeking me out. I had no interest in her because i knew she had a boyfriend and didnt want messing their relation,even though she somehow cheated from what she told me in this month.
Anyway,we've known eachother trough a common friend and she always wanted me hanging out with them.
 We were at a club some time ago and she picked me from the group to go sneaking drinks in the club for the rest of us,even tough this common friend of ours is her childhood bestfriend and could've went with him. It seemed strange,but i rolled with it. Bought booze,stayed 20 min for the 2 of us to finish a cheap wine and went in. Cracked jokes,but nothing else. Felt weird leaving our friend there and i didn't know if he liked her so didn't want to ruin anything. But, overall, i enjoyed spending time with her,quite fun.
They did try inviting me to other parties,but was busy with college so i skipped.(this was an year ago so by my calculations she was still together with this guy,but their 5 breakups might tell me they were on a break at that time since he wasn't at the club).
Anyway,we went to a festival around a month ago and i was invited by these two fellas. Ofcourse i joined because they insisted on me coming and she literally spoke to me on the phone to come or otherwise she will get mad at me. I laughed and joined the party. Again all funs and giggles,but she took my phone and posted herself on my instagram. She was close to posting it on public,but i told her not to do it because people would wonder who is she and why is she posting herself on his profile? (I knew if she did that,i would lose all my huzz,because i too was fresh out of a long distance rel so was looking for a gf at the time).
She posted it on close friends and people started messaging me who is she. Told them just a random girl. The next day she told me she was testing me to see if i had her on closefriends list. Chatted a bit and added eachother on it. In those fays at the festival,there was lots of drinking and alone time(because we somehow got separated from the group quite a lot) and after the festival she invited me to a coffee.( This was starting to get weird and and i was thinking she might be interested in me). Thanked me of taking care of her and telling her to watch her friends(those guys were really weird and tought they might wanna do ""something"" since she was drunk when she left with them to go home by their car).

Anyway,those were the first interactions with her that somehow lit the spark in me. All these were telling me she's interested.

We hanged out,for a whole month for 4 days a week and finally asked her if she's interested in me by any chance,because guys,i was head over heels at this point for her. Literally fell in love.
Got friendzoned. What the f.

She told me she's not well right now and doesn't want a relationship because it's too soon from the breakup(sidenote that's when i found out it was 2 months ago).
 

How do i beat this guy?
I'm sure he holds a special place in her soul because he was her first and i know it's important  for women.
But i'm also worried about me too,because i like her.
So,fwb could be a thing,but i'm questioning if she really is into me,because if she wanted to,she would've did something.

I could just go to other people just for the fun of it,but i really started making my mind about her,now i gotta bail.",3,1755291111.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

Post on a Schedule You Clearly Can..,"Looking at her recent Instagram activity, there are stretches where she posts consistently sometimes every few days, sometimes exactly a week apart which shows she’s capable of keeping a schedule.

For example, between November 22nd and January 30th, she posted multiple times only 1–7 days apart:

Nov 22 → Nov 23 (1 day)

Nov 23 → Nov 30 (7 days)

Dec 11 → Dec 18 (7 days)

Dec 18 → Dec 25 (7 days)

Dec 25 → Jan 1 (7 days)

Jan 22 → Jan 23 (1 day)

Jan 23 → Jan 30 (7 days)

But outside of those bursts, she has long gaps of 10–22 days or even a month:

Sept 6 → Sept 25 (19 days)

Oct 7 → Oct 29 (22 days)

Nov 3 → Nov 15 (12 days)

Jan 8 → Jan 22 (14 days)

Jan 30 → Feb 7 (8 days)

These long breaks interrupt her momentum. A consistent schedule could help her build her own independent audience separate from her dad’s fame
but she’s choosing not to keep it steady.

Here’s the reason:

On Tuesday, 8/12, at about 1PM, I experienced some chest pain that didn’t go away and started to get worse. 

I changed clothing into fresh underwear and easy to remove pants and shirt. 

Then I started to feel a burning pain down the left arm, to the fingertips. 

I had a triple bypass in March 2024 but never had heart symptoms like this. I called my wife and said that I was possibly having a heart attack. She told me to hang and call 911, then said she loved me and hung up. 

Within 3 minutes of the call the Fire Chief, who is a neighbor, was pounding on my door and 2 minutes later the Mobile ICU unit arrived. They hooked up the EKG and after about a minute they said “We are going now!” I walked over to the gurney and off we went, straight to the cath lab where I got two stents. 

Turns out I was having a serious heart attack. Very serious. 

So I am drafting a letter to the Fire Chief and want to drop a card and gift to the EMTs. I was thinking big bags (Costco sized) of a couple of different coffees and my wife will make some fudge-nut bars?

I’d appreciate feedback on the gifts and suggestions. 

The EMT team and modern medicine allowed me to walk out of the hospital the next day. 

So a general thank you to all the EMTs out there. ",2,1755290989.0,EMTstories,0,1.0,False

You guys...life is SO HARD for Kate Gosselin. 

In a recent TikTok broadcast from her kitchen, she lamented that she....she...(sobs)... has to WORK for a living. Yes, you read that right. She now has (wipes tears away) has returned to nursing and even manages to fill the dishwasher with the characteristic undertone of judgement and anger that we have all come to know is her 'brand'.

Kate brings that same energy to posts where she prepares her lunches, makes 'her' organic coffee creamer and kicks puppies...ok, I may have made that last one up but you can't prove it. Kate is active in her comments and on a recent post she spoke about why she had to return to nursing with it's 12-hour shifts. 

> *""Honestly? Providing for 8 kids, college funds which I am proud to say covered all of their college and more and LAWYERS,""*  Oh yeah, blame the lawyers. Blame the edit. Blame the producers. We've been here, girl...we've been here.   
  
She went on to further explain:  
*""Sickening but I was drug into court constantly and that costs A TON. Sad bc my kids could have a lot more saved and I could have a retirement saved if it weren’t for lawyers :(.""*  

My personal favorite: ""*reality TV doesn’t pay as well as it should when you have to provide for 8 kids on your own*."" That damn TLC...helping to make you famous without providing an endless amount of money for all eternity! SHAME! They should do a Kate Gosselin marathon over Labor Day weekend to throw her some coin.  

Recently, her son Collin posted a TikTok using a photo of his siblings with this:

>Forced apart, pitted against each other. All the fame and money in the world, but what about kids being kids? I will always love them more than anything. The tears I shed behind closed doors, thinking about the memories we could've shared. I love you guys...

Dad, Jon, whom I like to envision still wearing his Ed Hardy t-shirts ...commented '*Maybe some day we an be all together, Love ya'*

Collin has **not** been quiet about his feelings towards his mother. Last year he accused her of abuse and neglect. Collin alleges that when he was younger, Kate zip-tied his hands and feet together, then locking him in the basement of their home.

I have a close friend who always gives me advice on pregnancy and parenting. She’s a good friend and has good intentions.. but oh man, it’s really stressing me out now. When I shared the news, she got very excited and starting demanding (or commanding) me to quit drinking coffee (which I already did when I found out), food restrictions, and offered pregnancy and parenting books she had at home. I was a bit taken back when she started telling me that she was looking into court wedding ceremony because my bf (for 10 years) and i were not married yet. I gently but firmly told her no, thank you and we’ll do it at our own terms. 

On another day, she started commenting on my house, how its not organized, too much junk all over the house, and how it’s going to be more chaotic with the baby.. um, okay my house is not gonna be in a magazine or anything, but it just looks like a normal home.. she also talked about my dog and how it’s not good for the baby. And another thing was water. My bf refill my 5gal water jug every week from water dispenser which is just my drinking water, and we also use brita for cooking. She told me how that’s not good for pregnancy and how water is polluted that the pipes that go to water dispenser could carry other bad things… going on and on about how it can cause birth defects (no scientific evidence to any of her statements) but i was like ok, let me look into water filtration system for home. When I did, i found out i couldn’t install it at home because i rent and the contract states clearly not to install. So i was like ok, many people drink this same water i drink everyday and they’re fine. 

I just get so frustrated and stressed out, and im more concerned about me getting anxious and stressed that it’s going to cause adhd or something to this child.

  Our entire ceiling is covered with hundreds of little glow-in-the-dark stars.  
  
  “They’re beautiful,” I tell Katie. “When did you find time to do that?”  
  
  “I didn’t do it. That’s why I asked if you did it. ”  
  
  “I didn’t do it,” I say again.  
  
  “Who do you think did?”  
  
  “I have no idea. Unless it was Annie. Is that why she was so adamant that we come to her room tonight? Is she trying to cheer us up?”  
  
  “Could be. But she was with us the whole time. ”  
  
  My mind drifts to Aiden handing me a little star today in French. Me getting mad at him and tossing it back.  
  
  Then tonight. The cake. The peace offering.  
  
  Could Aiden have done this?  
  
  But that doesn’t make sense.  
  
  They were for the dream girl.  
  
  But in class he said something about my sisters liking them. About how they reminded me of home. Was he just trying to get rid of them?  
  
  ""I think I might know,” I whisper to Katie.  
  
  I grab my phone from my bedside table and call Aiden.  
  
  “Hey, Boots, what's up?” he says, in his smooth delicious voice. “Get it? What’s up?”  
  
  “Aiden, did you . . . ”  
  
  He doesn't let me finish. “The answer to your question is yes. I did put stars all over your ceiling. ”  
  
  “They’re beautiful. But I don’t understand why you did it. ”  
  
  “I did it because I think it’s time you finally knew that the stars were always for you. Always. Only. Ever. For you. ”

  “I just thought you should know that you were the person I wanted to ask to Homecoming. ”  
  
  “But then why did you tell Riley what Whitney did? Why did you help keep Dawson and me together?”  
  
  “Because I don’t like to see you hurt. And, honestly, I didn’t think he’d come back right away. ”  
  
  “I cut my knee. ”  
  
  “I know you did. ”  
  
  “I thought they were for someone else. ”

  “It's not all sweet. Every night when you go to sleep, I know you’ll see the stars and think of me. Sweet dreams, Boots. ”  
  
  I end the call and look at my ceiling, remembering how sick I felt when I thought they were for someone else. How perfect it would’ve been. How he had touched my pinkie. How just his touch causes me to react in a way I've never experienced. How I would’ve said yes, then rolled to face him, and kissed him.  
  
  Maybe I would have even given that boy some tongue.  
  
  I want to lie here and swoon, but . . .  
  
  I sit up and flip on my lamp. ""Katie?”  
  
  ""So, Aiden did it?""  
  
  ""Yeah. "" I tell her about the stars. About all that happened. About how I was wrong. “But there's something else. ""  
  
  ""What?""  
  
  ""He told me he's glad we're becoming friends. ""  
  
  She frowns. “Friends? He wants to be your friend?”  
  
  “I don’t know. Do you think I was just friend-zoned?”  
  
  “Do you really think he'd put up all these stars for just a friend?”  
  
  “Um, I don't know for sure. ”  
  
  “Turn your light back off. They’re pretty,” she says sleepily.  
  
  “Yeah, they are. ”  
  
  I lie down and wait for them to start glowing again.

  They are just stars. Just stars.  
  
  They don't mean he loves you. They mean he was going to ask you to Homecoming. As a friend.  
  
  My mind goes to the dream girl.  
  
  I so wish I was the dream girl.  
  
  But I’m not. He said friends. He wants peace and friendship.  
  
  He doesn't love you.

  The mark of true love.  
  
  7:40am  
  
  My phone vibrates with a text from Grandpa. I can picture him sitting at his desk, overlooking the rosebushes in his back yard.  
  
  But wait. Grandpa always emails me. When did he learn to text?  
  
  Grandpa: To answer your question about the difference between love and true love, I have a simple answer. True love leaves a mark. Sometimes with a frying pan. LOL  
  
  And when did he learn what LOL is?  
  
  Me: Grandpa, this is serious! Ask Grandma if you don’t know. And HOW CAN YOU NOT KNOW?? You’ve been married to the same woman for 39 years!!!  
  
  Grandpa: True love is a crapshoot. Sometimes you get lucky and hit the jackpot. Sometimes you’re left wallowing drunk and broke.  
  
  Me: You are not much help.  
  
  But as I’m walking to class, I’m thinking about Grandpa’s message and wondering if true love does leave a mark. Like the way Aiden’s kiss seared my skin that very first time he kissed me. Is that what it was? The mark of true love. Some sort of invisible hickey?  
  
  Speaking of hickeys.  
  
  Riley’s neck is covered with them.  
  
  “What? Did you get in a fight with a vacuum cleaner last night and lose?” I ask him.  
  
  He flips his collar up against his neck. “You know what they say, True love leaves a mark. ”  
  
  “My Grandpa just told me the same thing. That’s so weird you’d say that. But somehow I don’t think that’s what the great philosophers had in mind. ”  
  
  “Philosophers said that? That’s funny. I always thought it was something my dad made up. ” He grins naughtily at me. “You should see my chest. She wrote her name in hickeys. ”  
  
  I laugh. “I take it you and Ariela are back together? Did you sleep with her?”  
  
  “Naw, we’re having too much fun doing other stuff right now. ”  
  
  His words burn in my brain. We’re having too much fun doing other stuff. That’s what I missed with Dawson. I’ve never sucked on his neck long enough to give him even one hickey. Let alone written my name on his chest. I went way too fast with him. And I think because I did, we can’t really start over. I can’t take it back.  
  
  I feel like I should make a public service announcement over the loud speaker in school.  
  
  Note to all you daters out there:  
  
  Enjoy making out for hours.  
  
  Enjoy the way his lips feel on yours.  
  
  Enjoy embarrassing him with hickeys.  
  
  Enjoy holding his hand.  
  
  Enjoy the way he says your name when he tells you goodnight.  
  
  Enjoy when he shows up to walk you to your next class.  
  
  Enjoy how he licks hot fudge off your face.  
  
  Enjoy staring at the st  
ars with him.  
  
  Enjoy feeling crazy in love.  
  
  Like you will die if you don’t see him.  
  
  Like you will die if you have to stop kissing him.  
  
  Enjoy letting him romance you.  
  
  Revel in the slow pace.  
  
  Let your relationship build.  
  
  Then fall in love.  
  
  If only I could actually do that myself. I think of Aiden’s sex survey. Since I broke up with Sander, all of my relationships have happened really fast.  
  
  My mind flits to my mom saying, You need to love yourself.  
  
  Do I love myself?  
  
  Of course I do. I work out. I eat healthy. I try to get enough sleep. I always wear sunblock so I won’t get sun damage or premature wrinkles. I always try to look my best. Maybe I didn’t love myself when I was being a bitch to Vanessa, but since I’ve been here at Eastbrooke, I totally love who I am. I’m confident. I’m in lots of activities I love. I’m making friends with a wide variety of people. I’m nice to everyone.  
  
  Why wouldn’t I love myself? I’m awesome.  
  
  Except . . .  
  
  I felt embarrassed when I told Aiden how fast I slept with Cush.  
  
  And Dawson.  
  
  At the time, it felt right. And I’d known Cush and Brooklyn for a long time. It’s not like I’d just met them.  
  
  Like Dawson.  
  
  I slept with Dawson fast.  
  
  Why?  
  
  Because I was hurt about B and needed to feel loved? Wanted? Adored?  
  
  Or was it just because he was so freaking hot that I couldn’t help myself?  
  
  The current state of your neck.  
  
  History  
  
  When class is almost over, the phone rings on our teacher’s desk.  
  
  He picks it up, listens, then frowns disapprovingly in my direction. “Mr. Johnson and Miss Monroe, your presence is requested in the dean’s office. ”  
  
  “Do you think we’re in trouble?” I ask Riley as we walk down the hall.  
  
  “I can’t think of anything I’ve done to get in trouble. ”  
  
  “I’m almost positive that the current state of your neck is against the school’s decency policy. ”  
  
  “Probably, but you didn’t give them to me. ”  
  
  We round the corner and run into Dallas.  
  
  “Did you get called to the office too?” Riley asks.  
  
  Dallas whispers, “If they saw the video, we’re screwed. ”  
  
  “What do you mean?” I whisper back.  
  
  “I mean, we had our school blazers on. We could get expelled. ”  
  
  “Seriously?”  
  
  I can’t get expelled. I’m safe here.  
  
  Plus, I like it.  
  
  The dean meets us at the door and says, “Have a seat in my office. ”  
  
  We walk in and sit in the three chairs lined up in front of his desk.  
  
  “It has come to my attention that the three of you recently created a video. ”  
  
  Shit. Shit. Shit.  
  
  He pulls out three pieces of paper. Pieces of papers with our signatures at the bottom and the words “Eastbrooke Code of Conduct” at the top. “Do you recall signing these at the beginning of the school year?”  
  
  We all nod.  
  
  “In this document, you all agreed to protect Eastbrooke’s reputation. In the video, Mr. McMahon and Mr. Johnson are wearing pieces of their Eastbrooke uniforms. Combine that with underage drinking, some unbecoming sexual behavior by Miss Monroe, and it all adds up to the three of you possibly being expelled. ”  
  
  Please let possibly be a way out of this. I can’t let Riley and Dallas get expelled because of me.  
  
  “I can explain,” I say. “I’m sorry. I was really upset. Dawson and I broke up and the video wasn’t supposed to be seen by anyone but him. ”  
  
  “Did the video serve its purpose?”  
  
  “Well, he was upset by it, if that’s what you mean. ”  
  
  “Although I was disappointed with the video’s content, I was impressed by the overall quality of it. ”  
  
  Riley grins.  
  
  “Mr. Johnson, did you create this video? Do the editing and such? Can you tell me about the process?”  
  
  “Uh, sure,” Riley says. “Basically we did shots of us singing the same song a whole bunch of times in different situations, different settings. Then I pieced it together. ”  
  
  “Can I assume that none of you want to be expelled?”  
  
  We all nod.  
  
  “Then here’s what I expect. First, that video will be removed from YouTube before you leave my office. Second, I have a project for you. Eastbrooke understands the power of social media, and our upcoming Prospective Student Weekend does not have the number of participants that we would like. I’d like you to create a video showcasing the school. Give students a reason to come see what we’re all about. Obviously, it needs to be classy and uphold the Eastbrooke tradition, but maybe you can make it a little less stuffy than the informational video we have on the school’s website. Can you shoot the video, edit it, and have it ready for my approval by this afternoon?”  
  
  Riley nods his head yes, but I’m thinking about something else.  
  
  I just realized that uploading the video of me was really dumb. What if Vincent had come across it somehow? Actually, that’s silly. The internet is a massive place and since I wasn’t tagged in it with my name, he’d have better odds finding a needle in a haystack. But, still, the idea of me being in a video that could lead him straight here scares me.  
  
  “Um, do I have to be in the video? Can we recruit some other students?”  
  
  “Yes, Keatyn, you do have to be in the video. It’s better than the alternative, correct?”  
  
  “Yes, sir,” I gulp. I could mention that Vincent finding me would be much, much worse, but I don’t. I can’t. Riley and Dallas are my friends. I need to start being a good friend back. And a good friend wouldn’t let them get expelled.  
  
  “I don’t want you just getting your friends out of class,” he says, as he writes on a piece of paper. “But if you need additional students, use this pass. ”  
  
  Every boy’s fantasy.  
  
  9:30am  
  
  Riley removes the slutty video before we leave the dean’s office. As soon as we get out of the building, Dallas says, “Getting expelled would not have been good. ”  
  
  “No, it wouldn’t have been,” I agree.  
 Riley grins. “Let’s go get my camera. ”  
  
  “Any idea what we’re going to film?”  
  
  “No. But you’re in drama. Write a script. ”  
  
  “I don’t know what to say. ”  
  
  “The purpose of the video is to get students to want to come here. So let’s show them how much fun we have. I think I’m going to include clips of how Dawson asked you to Homecoming. The dean with a letter on his naked chest is a cool thing. And I have a bunch of footage that I shot during Homecoming. Then we just can include a little blurb at the end about the upcoming Greek/PSW weekend. ”  
  
  “Maybe we need to get some of the Olympian gods to be shirtless. ”  
  
  Riley grins at me. “You, start writing the script. ” Then he turns to Dallas. “And, you, go get Maggie, Ariela, Aiden, Jake, and Logan out of class. ”  
  
  “Why them?”  
  
  “If I’m going to appeal to 8th grade boys, I need hot girls. Plus, it’s every boy’s fantasy. A blonde, a brunette, and a redhead. All together, waiting for him at Eastbrooke. ”  
  
  We get to his room. While he messes with his camera, I grab his laptop, sit at his desk, and pull up Eastbrooke’s website and perspective student video.  
  
  Eastbrooke: Honor. Tradition. Excellency.  
  
  It goes on about how great Eastbrooke is in a very boring fashion. There are still shots of kids in classes. At activities. One of a cheering crowd at a sporting event. Really, it’s pretty bland and impersonal. I can see why kids aren’t signing up for the PSW.  
  
  Hmmm.  
  
  I spin on Riley’s chair. “So what if we start with this shot. The beginning of the other video with the “honor, tradition, and excellency” thing, then make it look like we tagged it with graffiti. Like we’ve spray painted a big cougar paw over the top of it. ”  
  
  “I like it. What do you think for a script?”  
  
  “I don’t know that just showing clips of Homecoming and stuff is a good idea. That’s what’s on the other video. Photos of people you don’t know. It’s really impersonal. ”  
  
  “So, let’s make it personal. Talk about us. ”  
  
  “Our story?”  
  
  “Yeah. Let’s take them through a day. Getting coffee and breakfast with our friends. Goofing around in the halls between classes. Dinner. Hanging out in our dorms. ” He smirks. “Maybe you girls could wear your Mission: Impossible lingerie and have a pillow fight. ”  
  
  “Very funny. But I think the idea of showing us girls hanging out in my dorm is a great idea. I mean, really, the dorm can be like one big slumber party. ”  
  
  “Exactly. And I’ll get some shots of the guys, chilling in Aiden’s room, playing video games. Texting girls. Stuff like that. ”  
  
  “That sounds good. And maybe dance practice, soccer practice, rehearsal. There’s a French club meeting at lunch and lit club after dance. We can recreate whatever we want to. ”  
  
  “The dean is really cool,” Riley replies. “We’re lucky. ”  
  
  “Yeah, we are. ”  
  
  “Okay, so before everyone gets here, I want to record you. Let’s go outside where the lighting is good. Do you know what you want to say?”  
  
  “I think so, yes. ”  
  
  We get situated outside of Hawthorne House. “Riley, you know, one of my favorite things about this school is how pretty it is. So let’s make sure we get shots of the trees, and we should get some shots of a pick-up soccer game in the common area. ”  
  
  “Shirts and skins?”  
  
  “Absolutely! So what do you want me to do? Should I stand or sit on the steps?”  
  
  “Stand. I love those little thigh-high sock things you wear. Those ribbon ones are my favorite. ”  
  
  Riley holds up the camera and says, “Roll that. ”  
  
  Which causes me to crack up instead of talking.  
  
  “Maybe we can do some bloopers at the end. ” He nods at me. “Go. ”  
  
  I smile for the camera and start talking. “Hi, I’m Keatyn. I was sitting where you are, just a few months ago, watching videos, trying to decide where to go to school. You can learn all about academic excellence and tradition on the other video, but, in this video, we want you to experience Eastbrooke. ”  
  
  He stops recording. “That’s good, I like it. ”  
  
  “I want to introduce you and Dallas. Tell them how we met. Then we’ll follow all of us on our day. ”  
  
  Dallas shows up with Maggie, Logan, Jake, Ariela, and Aiden. After Riley and Ariela suck each other’s faces off, we fill everyone in on what we want to do. Riley hands Jake the camera.  
  
  I speak to the camera. “This is Riley and Dallas. Say hi, boys. ”  
  
  Dallas says, “Hey, y’all,” in his adorable accent. Riley, hotly, sticks out his tongue at the camera and yells, “What’s up?”  
  
  We spend the day filming all over school. Some scenes with just a few of us. Others with classrooms full of students.  
  
  After that, Ariela goes back to class, and the others are off recruiting guys for the pick-up soccer game.  
  
  I’m sitting in the grass waiting for them to show up.  
  
  I glance at the goal and think about Aiden, who, even though he’s been helping on and off today, has been acting weird.  
  
  Like, sort of standoffish, maybe.  
  
  Sometimes he gives me those looks. Like he wants to talk to me or say something, but then he doesn’t.  
  
  And I really don’t know what his deal is.  
  
  Maybe now he’s embarrassed about the stars?  
  
  Aiden is first to return. He has a soccer ball and is bouncing it off his knees over and over again.  
  
  “Wanna see if you can score on me?” he asks, finally saying a full sentence to me for the first time today.  
  
  “I probably wouldn’t do very well in these heels,” I reply, bending my knee to show him a cute shoe. “But I would like to play you again. Especially since you told me only, like, ten people have ever scored on you. ”  
  
  “That was just in games. ”  
  
  “Fine, then. We’ll consider it a game. ”  
  
  “How will it work?”  
  
  “Hmm. I'll kick a penalty shot. No, I’ll kick twenty of them. If I get eleven of them past you and into the net, I win. ”  
  
  “And what will you win?”  
  
  “Bragging rights are all I need. ”  
  
  “No, it needs to be bigger than that. Let me think about it, B-Moi. ”  
  
  “I’m not sleeping with you if you win,” I say immediately, knowing that’s what his shortened Baise moi is suggesting.  
  
  “I wouldn't want you to,” he says.  
  
  My face drops. He doesn’t want to sleep with me? I look down at the grass and start studying the blades.  
  
  Oh, I have so been friend-zoned. He just wanted to get rid of the stupid stars. That’s all it was.  
  
  I’m not the one. Not the dream girl.  
  
  I see Aiden’s shoes coming toward me. He kneels down next to me, but I refuse to look at him. If I do, I’ll probably start crying.  
  
  Oh, I hate him.  
  
  “Boots?” he says. I pretend to be really interested in the single blade of grass I just picked. He puts his hand under my chin and pushes it up so I have to look into his sparkling emerald eyes. “When we sleep together, it's not going to be because of a bet. ”  
  
  I swallow.  
  
  And turn away quickly.  
  
  When we sleep together?  
  
  Is that what he wants? Is that why he wants to be my friend? Does he want to be friends with benefits?  
  
  Sorry, Aiden. Been there. Done that. Hacked the shirt with scissors, ripped it to shreds, then burned the effing thing to oblivion.  
  
  Fortunately, Riley runs by, flicks my hair, and steals the soccer ball out of Aiden’s hands, causing Aiden to tear off after him.  
  
  While they chase each other around, my mind wanders to what sleeping with Aiden would be like.  
  
  I’m pretty sure it would be like dropping the hairdryer in the tub while I'm taking a bath.  
  
  I  
’d probably be majorly electrocuted and die.  
  
  But I bet it would be worth the risk.  
  
  All the guys show up, so Riley goes into director mode. Saying who he wants on which team. Who should take off their shirts. And what to do.  
  
  I’m sitting in the grass next to Maggie, thinking about how fitting it is that this field be included in the video. It was one of the first things I saw when I got here. When I took a deep breath and finally felt safe. And, later, how crazy I was to run down the hill, steal the ball from Dawson, and kick it past Aiden’s head. Dawson bringing me here to ask me out. Aiden and me sitting on the bench outside the library, overlooking the field, and watching the sunset.  
  
  Maggie elbows my side. “So, tell me about the stars. What happened? Are you and Aiden gonna get together now? What are you going to do about Dawson? Did you see Jake was teasing me? I think I might like him. Should I like him?”  
  
  I smile at her. Maggie is such a beautiful girl, and I adore her fun personality. She and Jake would be cute together, but it also seems like there’s something going on with her and Logan. Something about the way they look at each other.  
  
  I grab her hand. “Before I answer all that, I just want to say that I’m so glad we’re friends. Sitting here reminds me of when school started. ”  
  
  “I remember hearing about the crazy-ass girl who kicked a soccer ball past Aiden. I never imagined we’d become good friends. But I love you. You’re as crazy as me. ” She grabs me and pulls me into a hug.  
  
  Riley, who has apparently caught our moment on tape, yells from across the field, “Make out!”  
  
  Maggie and I respond in the exact same manner at the exact same time, both flipping him off and then lying back in the grass and giggling.  
  
  After getting an appropriate number of shirts vs. skins shots, I take Riley into the dance locker room and then get the girls together to hang out in my dorm room. We change into pajamas and do all the stuff we usually do. Gossip, paint our nails, talk on social media, do homework, and eat.  
  
  Then we do the same thing with the boys. Show a football practice. Riley lifting weights. Dallas running. Then all the guys piled into Aiden’s room, eating and playing video games. Aiden and me studying in the library. Him slaughtering the French language and me trying to protect it.  
  
  After that, we go back to the dean to tell him we’re done filming, but that Riley will need tonight to edit it.  
  
  He asks us to have it to him by tomorrow morning at eight. Apparently, the school is going to email it to their prospective student list in hopes of buoying this weekend’s attendance.  
  
  Wrapped up in a relationship.  
  
  6:50pm  
  
  I get to rehearsal a little early. The director immediately pulls me aside.  
  
  “So, Miss Monroe, what did you decide? Are you going to give me a committed performance or are you going to quit?”  
  
  I smile. “I’m going to give you an amazing performance. I’m really sorry about last week. I kind of got caught up in a guy. ”  
  
  “Who you’ve since broken up with, or so I’ve heard. ”  
  
  “Yeah, but I was going to keep doing it even if that hadn’t happened. Acting is something I really want to do. Like, maybe even with my life. So, it’s important to me. I just, I sort of forgot to think about me. Have you ever done that?”  
  
  “Gotten wrapped up in a relationship? Sure. Everyone does sometimes. Learning that it’s okay to be yourself, have your own interests, and still be part of a committed relationship is part of growing up. And something I learned the hard way. ”  
  
  “Really, how?”  
  
  “In college, I was in a one-act play. But the girl I was dating had a sorority function the same night and was upset that I couldn’t go. She was going to take another date, so I quit the play even though it was important to me. ”  
  
  “Was the sorority thing that big of a deal?”  
  
  “Not really. And I held it against her, which then undermined our relationship. ”  
  
  “The one that got away, huh?”  
  
  “Actually, no. I chose to get away because she wasn’t supportive of me. If it was a good relationship, she would’ve come to my play, then we would have gone to the last half of her formal. You have to want to make it work. ”  
  
  I think about Tommy and Mom and how they won’t do movies at the same time in different locations. How they won’t be apart for more than a week. How supportive they are of each other. What Aiden said to me at tryouts flits through my brain. How, if Dawson loved me, he should be there supporting me. Watching me try out. Not making me feel guilty for doing what I love.  
  
  “That makes sense. ”  
  
  He smiles at me. “And I do have some good news for you. Wednesday and Thursday, you get the night off. We’re going to be focusing those rehearsals on memorizing lines. Since you have yours down, you get a little reward. ”  
  
  “Really?! Thank you!”  
  
  “No, thank you. It’s nice to work with a professional. You, Logan, and Jake are the only ones in the cast who are prepared. ”  
  
  I take my usual seat in the back of the auditorium and pull out my homework. Might as well get started on it. I have a comparative essay due tomorrow for English, math problems, a science worksheet, and history chapter questions.  
  
  I’m tackling the essay when my phone buzzes. I expect it to be Aiden since it’s unusual for him to be late.  
  
  Dawson: I missed walking you to class today.  
  
  Me: We were working on a project for the dean.  
  
  Dawson: I heard. Was it fun?  
  
  Me: Yeah, sort of. The dean saw the video we made on the plane. This was sort of our punishment.  
  
  Dawson: That video really upset me.  
  
  His comment makes me feel bad and pisses me off at the same time. It’s like he’s trying to make me feel bad for making him feel bad when he made me feel bad.  
  
  Does that even make sense?

Someone here said “Eat Big, Shit Big”, which is exactly what I did before my exam today! Also went on Ken’s live last night and man, the way he explains things and the confidence boost he gives you, underrated. 

I recognized some questions from my first attempt on this one, they were literally the exact same questions. Had barely any margin questions, more so just had to calculate what happens with the debit balance with interest and dividends which was a piece of cake cause margins were my weakest spot. Didn’t have to calculate all that maintenance or other bullshit 

Had some pattern day trading questions, which is funny cause I just got flagged as a pattern day trader yesterday lmao. Came in clutch. $25,000 remember that number.

Good amount of suitability questions, variable annuities questions, not a ton of math just basic shit like Current Yield and parity. Had a question about arbitration and arbitrage. 

Good amount of IRA questions, which I also wasn’t that great in, but compared the question with the answer set and made it work. 

Had one big ass question about breakpoints, gave you a big chart and how much you need to invest to qualify for the breakpoint idek if I got that one right. 

Good amount of muni and mutual fund questions. Had to do accretion or amortization which was valid. If I had to calculate accrued interest and all they gave me was the time the investor bought it and the days interest is paid, I woulda taken a 12 gauge to the screen cause I hated doing that, but they actually gave the days of accrued interest and it was easy. 


Shit ton of options which I WAS SO GLAD, I’ve been trading options in my robinhood account too (which hasn’t been the best cause of how aggressive and speculative I have been, also wtf is up with the market these days and what’s up with the trend of there being one Green Day and the next day a red day, god damn 0DTES man ), but definitely know the difference between protecting and generating income with options. 

Had like 4 questions about advertising, when to file with finra or principal approval stuff. 

It sucked failing the first time, I was pissed as fuck, hated myself. Took a week off from it, changed my study habits, went to coffee shops, campus, etc.. I was tweaking the first time I took it, rushed it, didn’t take all the information in. This time, I woke up I did my cardio I hit the sauna I ate fruit I had my lions mane drink I had a good breakfast and I sent it. I used Kaplan q bank way more this time which I didn’t last time which really helped me out with more so understanding the answer set than the actual topics. I got a new notebook, wrote every question I got wrong, wrote things I didn’t know much, and just kept taking as many questions as I could. 

All yall got this. Make the exam your bitch. Fuck all the noise and lock the fuck in. Develop better studying habits, better lifestyle habits, run this shit up. 

Thank you Ken and thank you everyone in this subreddit for their experiences. Now it’s onto the 66!

1mr9m4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1mr9m4m/struggling_to_stay_consistent_and_with_feeling/,Struggling to stay consistent and with feeling guilty,"I've carried credit card debt to some degree my entire adult life. I'd go thought periods of working on paying it off but then racking it back up again. I got pretty used to the minimun payment and sometimes I didn't even try to pay any more than that. Which looking back is wild to me because I realize the debt would never be paid off.      Anyway, last year I had rough patch, a few unexpected expensive and just being irresponsible and I manged to get my credit card debt up to almost $46,400. I had a moment of oh no what have I done and how the heck am I going to get out of this, but then I just decided I would never use a credit card again. Its been 10 months now. I had an initsl goal to cut all non essentials and exist on rice and beans only but I apparently have no will power. I don't buy any luxuries. All my clothes is bought heavily discounted or at thrift stores. I don't travel, or drink, or smoke, and I don't go out to restaurants. I do probably spend too much on food and snacks and fast food. Ive tried budgeting for this and will do well for awhile but then I'll get frustrated with the restrictions and will buy whatever I want. I did get a part time job to try to help pay the debt but it hoesntly doesn't add much. So anyway in the last 10 months, just by not using my cards, prioritizing making extra payments, and not spending frivolously on non food items, I have paid off $8000. I just did the math today and was shocked it's as much as it is as I felt I could have been more strict - such as sticking to a very strick budget for food, not buying any clothes or gifts etc. I'm having some guilt that i could have paid more maybe but i also think it would have been minimal like maybe another couple of grand at most. I obviously want to pay the debt off and be free from it ASAP but I also think I will burn out if I am overly restrictive so im thinking of just carrying on like I have been and trying to find ways to cut expences when I can. Ive looked into selling my vehicle to try to pay the debt faster but I'd be upside down and I need it for work so it wouldn't have helped. There's no way to lean iut my fixed expenses any further. I still am on the look out for a more lucrative part time job but there not many options in my area. I struggle with the mental load of the debt and feeling guilty any time I buy a coffee (maybe a couple times a week at most). I guess im just looking for any advice anyone might have to offer.

(Here’s How Anyone Can Start in 3 Minutes) 🚀,"Okay, hold up… am I the only one just now figuring out people get PAID—real money—to beta test apps?  
Like, no degree, no Silicon Valley, no coding required? Just a phone, wifi, and the ability to click around? Is this for real??

So, I basically fell down this bizarre rabbit hole last night. Honestly, I half-expected it to be a scam.  
But the reviews? ALL legit.  
And then I saw one influencer say she bought coffee for a whole month just with her earnings from beta testing.  
Guys, **mind blown**!

Here’s what I learned:  
If you’re sick of “side hustles” that suck up time and barely pay, beta testing apps looks… weirdly doable.  
Here’s why it actually *works* for total beginners (seriously—no techy stuff needed):

---
**How You Can Start Testing Apps for Cash—Zero Experience Required:**

- **Step 1:** Jump over to **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** and sign up (it literally took me 3 minutes with just an email).
- **Step 2:** After you create your account, you get a dashboard showing you what tests are available.  
Like, instant options: new games, photo editing, private social media apps, etc.   
- **Step 3:** You download the test app, play around, and spot bugs or things that confuse you (even if it’s just “Why is this button so weird?”).
- **Step 4:** Report back via a simple form, click submit, and boom—you just made money.

No clunky setup, no fake ""surveys,"" and you don't need to keep info private.  
And did I mention you get more offers the more you complete?

---

Honestly, this is perfect if…  
- you want remote work  
- you want easy “micro jobs” you can do when bored  
- you want cash for basically *trying out* new apps (yes, BEFORE they launch)

Like, at this point, why WOULDN’T you do this?  
Even teens and students are getting on it.  
**[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** doesn’t require you to be in the US or EU—anyone worldwide can join!

**Rapidfire Beta Tester FAQ:**

- **How much can you make?** Varies, but seeing $10/task for simple app feedback isn’t rare.
- **Do I need expensive gear?** No—you just need a smartphone, some apps need a laptop but most don’t care.
- **Are there limits?** Some apps let you test a couple hours/week, but there are always more platforms popping up… just start at **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**.

Why am I still shocked that I missed out on this until now?

I (25M) have been single my whole life, never dated anybody and I am afraid It might stay like this because I am functionally unable to flirt. 

First topic : friends since I'm pretty sure this'll be brought up at some point, I do have a few friends which are scattered all over the country so I see them on rare occasions. Half of them are from high school, the second half is from my Master's courses. I have absolutely failed to build any lasting friendship between 2017 and 2023.

I have been studying since I got out of HS (with some summer jobs, internships and last year was 4 month uni/8 month working for a shitty pharmaceutics lab), currently doing a PhD in food science so I have pretty much never been able to unwind fully because work is never really over. 

Basically my life is get up>go to work>work>go back home>distract myself for a bit with the current hyperfixation, eat>sleep rince and repeat every day (as for most of us I guess). Groceries and house cleaning on weekends which takes like half a day (as for most of us I guess). 

I tried a few times to get on dating apps but never really kept logging in past a week, for 2 reasons: first the heavy emphasis on appearance felt extremely reductive and second I didn't really happen to match with people and when I did it felt very forced and I panicked and didn't know what to say to the person I matched with. I must say I have a very hard time with social skills in general, feeling comfortable around people takes me 7-8 month of *daily interactions* on average I'd say (this is not an immutable law of nature of course there have been a few people I have been able to connect almost instantly with but never really in durable way). This is part of why I suspect undiagnosed neurodivergency along with other behaviours (hating tight clothes, can't bear the feeling of grease on my hands to the point I never eat crisps if I am not at home or know I have a faucet nearby I can use, general social awkwardness, extreme anxiety regarding transportation [if I have to take a train I will be at the station 40min early because anything later gives me massive anxiety]) that my brother has been bringing up as being ""on the spectrum"" 

Going out on my own feels weird but I still do occasionally treat myself to some smoothies/coffee/sweets or going to the restaurant [this became more and more uncomfortable as time went by so now I mostly do takeout or delivery when I do] and I would absolutely never talk to a stranger there because I have no idea if they are open to me talking to them or not [preshoting this one since most people tell me to ""go to the bar and talk to people"" which is always baffling since in my mind it is almost equal to harassment].

Most of my hobbies were there from the beginning 
: things like video-games, manga, anime, series, movies, music which is great because I get to experience so many stories that moved me in so many ways but they are also very isolating since most of them require me to be home.

On flirting inability : every depiction I have witnessed of flirt has seemed to me a lot like sexual harassment which I don't want any part in so I don't really know what to do.

Anyways, sorry for bothering you but posting on the internet is so much easier than talking, I get to organise my thoughts even though it ends up being all over the place again but at least I do not seem like an utter fool.

At least this situation presents the advantage of not making someone wait for me when lab hours get long (not that I think anyone deserves to waste time waiting for me anyways) but yeah, I'd like to feel how it's like having someon special and being special to someone, must be nice not being alone, especially when the world seems as fucked as it seems right now",1,1755290085.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1mr9gfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmohackbook/comments/1mr9gfj/how_i_use_the_freedom_model/,How I use the Freedom Model,"# 

Hello, this is just a walkthrough I use for myself based on notes from the Freedom Model. I have read posts with questions about how to actually use the book and benefits-to-benefits analysis to make happier choices so I thought it would be helpful. Wishing you all good luck in this process.

The Freedom Model in Action

You find yourself desiring porn, cigarettes, weed, alcohol, whatever. For our instance we will use porn and masturbation as an example. Maybe it has been a long day, you’re feeling stressed out, or you’re just in a low mood. There doesn’t even need to be a condition for you to desire porn. Maybe you just are thinking about watching it and it feeling good.

You pick up your phone or laptop and go to a private place, it feels as if there’s a force that is out of your control dragging you there. You take your willy out and start jerkin it, watching whatever it is that you fancy. Then you remember that you just read the freedom model, and you realize something. There is no “force” making you do this. There is nothing that has dragged you into this private place and made you start pleasuring yourself. This is the Positive Drive Principle in action, which states that you are simply doing what you believe makes you the happiest. Assuming you read the freedom model and actually agree with its claims about free will, you also realize that you are not an inanimate object, and porn or drugs or whatever are not some powerful force capable of bending our minds to their will. This is the social programming of the recovery society that we live in. This is relieving you from the actual truth, which is that you are doing this completely of your own free will, not for no reason, but because you simply believe that this is your happiest option available right now. The second truth is that there is nothing shameful about this at all. Consider a man using prescription opioids to deal with crippling pain, versus the homeless heroin user living on the street. They use the exact same drug. It is society that decides what is shameful and what is not, but you do not have to cop to these beliefs, especially when they are completely subjective. Lots of shame has been placed on masturbation and porn use, but in reality, you’re just seeking what you believe feels good, and is also your happiest option in that moment. Is that so wrong? You must remove the shame or “badness” from the act to see it for what it really is. The shame you associate with it also makes it more appealing. You need to see for yourself, that you can do whatever you want. There is nothing that you “should” or shouldn’t do. That is a huge part of this process. You can’t change your preferences through shame or focusing on the costs of doing something. You need to look at it as banal a choice as deciding between tea or coffee in the morning. Whatever it is you choose, it is because you could not see a happier (more beneficial) option at the time.

This is the importance of shedding the alcoholic/addict self image that has been placed on anyone who engages in porn/drugs/alcohol/food/etc. Going through the chapters of the book that breaks down exactly why this self image is irrational is crucial, because you are trying to move away from a preference change because something is “bad” “shameful” or “addicting”, to making a preference choice with the priority being your own best path to happiness and nothing else. You must see pursuing happiness as a moral act, and that doing it through porn or substances isn’t bad or crazy, it is completely natural and normal, because of the pdp.

So now that you see that it isn’t a shameful thing to do, and that there’s nothing “making you do it”, and that you are doing it because you believe it is the happiest option at the time, you can take a moment to pause. Sure, you could do it, there’s nothing wrong with that, but is it really my happiness option right now? Admit what you believe actually feels good about it, the benefits of doing it, and then ask yourself this:

I believe these benefits are true and I would be happier doing this thing, it is why I am desiring it right now. But could there be another option that has even more benefits that I’ve been underestimating?

This is the benefits-to-benefits analysis that they talk about in the book, that can only occur once you remove the shame from the equation, and look at it purely as choosing between what will make you happier. I proceed with the analysis like this:

1. Reassessing the value of the benefits of porn.

Consider the benefits of watching porn first. Write them down, think about them. Now ask yourself, is it possible I am overvaluing these benefits? Is it possible that these things which seem desirable in my head have been blown out of proportion? Either by myself or by society? Is getting off on watching other people have sex really as valuable to me as it used to be?

The reality is that you are most likely overvaluing the benefits of porn or whatever substance you may be using. Another substance that’s a good example for me is meth. I’ve never used meth. I am very aware it gets you so high, some people describe the feeling of taking a hit as busting in your pants. But the difference between a meth user and me is that they value this high and I don’t. I don’t interpret receiving that much dopamine as an enjoyable thing. I prefer lower stimulation to higher stimulation. The same thing can be applied to porn here. Break it down to what it is. Like tfm says, **you** add the pleasure to the activity. The activity itself is simply naked people on a screen, or people having sex on a screen. For me, I have deduced that this can simply be looked at as stimulation of a sexual nature. It doesn’t even make me horny anymore, it just provides dopamine or super-stimulation with sex being the theme.

So is that really that valuable? Think about getting drunk or high similarly. Is it really that great or have you been taught and trained that it is great? That it is useful for social situations, or it relaxes you or whatever. This is where you need to separate society’s interpretation of a thing’s value with your interpretation of a thing’s value within your own life. When you’re young and discovering porn and you’re talking about it with your friends, it SEEMS like it’s this great, enjoyable thing. But do you still value it the same way now? Is it still moving your life towards a happier direction?

2. Reassessing the value of the benefits of a life without porn (or even moderation).

Remember, the point of tfm is that making this choice isn’t about avoiding costs, or shame or anything like that. It is about figuring out what will brings you the most happiness. When you realize this, it actually becomes an exciting and fun process. Odds are you’ve been doing this thing (porn) believing it is your happiest option (this can be difficult to admit at first), but in reality there may be another option (abstinence) that could bring you WAY more benefits and happiness. Isn’t that an awesome and exciting thing?

Basically, you’ve been sleeping on these benefits, and as the pdp says, you are always going to do what you believe is your happiest option, whether you’re aware of these beliefs or not. When you desire porn, it is because you aren’t desiring abstinence. It’s because you aren’t fully aware of its benefits. Another reason is because you may be undervaluing the benefits of abstinence and overvaluing the benefits of porn.

To make abstinence more desirable than porn, you have to make yourself aware of all its benefits, and see for yourself if that makes for a happier option overall. This is a very personal process, that is different from person to person. For me, as a kid, I really did value porn. It was fun and exciting at the time. Now abstinence seems more fun and exciting to me.

When you begin to forget about the benefits of abstinence, when you forget that this is the happier option, is when you will naturally desire porn again. So you have to continually remind yourself of these benefits. Not as a rote thing where you’re trying to “quit” porn, but actually assessing both options, and reminding yourself of how awesome the benefits of abstinence are. This process is called cognitive appraisal. It is what we do all the time, like in the tea versus coffee example, weighing two options.

Accurately assessing the benefits of abstinence when compared with the benefits of porn. A good idea is to write down these benefits, and look at them every day, so you don’t forget about what you’re gaining with abstinence.

Remember, you can watch porn. You can do anything you want, as you are entitled to what makes you happiest. It is simply a matter of figuring out whether that is the happiest option or whether abstinence may be happier, and doing the work to compare the benefits of both, and assess the value of these benefits to get a better idea of what is actually contributing more to your overall happiness. Sexual stimulation vs greater confidence, sexual energy, motivation, ambition, peace, focus, and self esteem? For me this is how I compare these. I have no need to “convince” myself of which is better, I simply use rational thought to look at which options and their respective benefits actually make me happier, and move forward in life pursuing benefits rather than avoiding costs. There is nothing to maintain or avoid here, the only thing I’m doing is appreciating the benefits of a life without porn in it.

The beauty of the freedom model is that it can be applied to many things in life. For me another one was food. Using the freedom model and benefits-to-benefits analysis I realized that the benefits of losing weight (which for me are feeling better about myself and being a healthier weight) were more beneficial to my overall happiness than the benefits of eating delicious food that caused me to put on weight. As much as I used to love eating sweets and extravagant meals, I really thought about the it and came to the conclusion that those foods just don’t hold a lot of value in my life anymore, and that what’s a lot more valuable to me than delicious foods and feeling stuffed is feeling good about my body, which for me comes from losing weight. So naturally, my preferences changed, and I’m okay with eating just til I’m full instead of over eating, and eating meals that are less tasty but are overall more healthy and contribute to this goal of losing weight and feeling good.

Rather than trying not to think about the benefits of porn, remember the benefits of abstinence, and how valuable they are to you. Then you can reassess the value of porn when compared to the benefits of not watching it.

  
That's it, I apologize if it's a bit too stream-of-consciousness, but hopefully this helps some people. It took me multiple listens through the freedom model before I felt I really understood it. At the end of the day, the most important thing is remembering this is about your happiness, and making that a priority. Simply reminding myself every morning that I need to put my happiness first and using that as a basis for decisions in life especially ones regarding porn and substance use has helped greatly.

## Key features Analysis

The effectiveness of a body scrub massage hinges on its key features, from the type of exfoliant used to the massage techniques employed. Understanding these elements is crucial when choosing the right treatment.

**Exfoliating Agents:** Different body scrubs utilize various exfoliating agents to remove dead skin cells. These can range from natural ingredients like sea salt, sugar, and coffee grounds to more gentle options like jojoba beads and fruit enzymes. The best exfoliating agent for you depends on your skin type and sensitivity.The Choice of exfoliating agent drastically changed the effectiveness of the scrub by removing all dead skin and smoothing the overall skin texture.Scrubs containing larger particles,like sea salt,provide a more vigorous exfoliation,making them ideal for thicker skin.conversely, finer particles like sugar or jojoba beads are suitable for sensitive skin that requires a gentler touch.

**Massage Techniques:** The massage techniques used during a body scrub treatment play a notable role in stimulating circulation and lymphatic drainage. Techniques can vary from gentle, sweeping motions to more invigorating, deep-tissue massage.

The application of massage techniques is more than just a relaxing experience. This includes effleurage to warm the muscles, petrissage to increase circulation, and tapotement to stimulate the nervous system. The right combination of techniques can help to loosen tight muscles, reduce cellulite, and promote a sense of well-being.

**Aromatherapy Oils:** Many body scrub massages incorporate aromatherapy oils to enhance the therapeutic benefits.These oils not only add a pleasant fragrance but also offer specific properties that can soothe, energize, or detoxify the skin and mind.

The Aromatherapy addition can improve the overall experience due to its natural oils that are added to many body treatments and provide additional moisture and hydrating properties. Lavender, for example, is known for its calming and relaxing effects, while eucalyptus can help to clear sinuses and improve respiratory function. Citrus oils like grapefruit and lemon are often used for their energizing and detoxifying properties. Consider the specific needs and preferences to choose the right blend of aromatherapy oils.

**Hydrating Ingredients:** Exfoliation can sometimes leave the skin feeling dry, so high-quality body scrubs often include hydrating ingredients to replenish moisture. Common ingredients include shea butter, cocoa butter, coconut oil, and hyaluronic acid.

Hyaluronic Acid is a powerful ingredient for keeping your skin moist. Products that contain hyaluronic acid often have additional soothing properties that can reduce redness and irritation.

**Temperature Control:** The temperature of the scrub and the surrounding environment can considerably impact the overall experience. Warm scrubs can help to relax muscles and open pores, while a cool room can provide a refreshing contrast.

Temperature Control allows your body to relax properly during the message. Also, ensuring that the scrub is comfortably warm is essential for maximizing its benefits and avoiding any discomfort or shock to the system. This careful attention to detail can elevate the entire experience and leave the skin feeling refreshed and rejuvenated.

**Customization Options:** The best body scrub massages often offer customization options to cater to individual needs and preferences. This might include choosing the type of scrub, the intensity of the massage, and the specific aromatherapy oils used.

## Core benefits

A body scrub massage offers a wide range of benefits that extend beyond just superficial skin improvements. From enhancing circulation to reducing stress, these treatments can significantly contribute to overall well-being.

**improved Skin Texture:** The primary benefit of a body scrub massage is the removal of dead skin cells, which can leave the skin feeling rough, dull, and uneven. By exfoliating the surface, the treatment reveals fresh, smooth, and radiant skin underneath.

Consistent exfoliation helps to even out skin tone, reduce the appearance of blemishes, and improve the overall texture of the skin. Many users report noticeably softer and smoother skin after just one treatment and continued scrubs will make the texture better.

**Enhanced Circulation:** The massage component of a body scrub treatment stimulates blood flow and lymphatic drainage. This can definitely help to reduce inflammation,promote detoxification,and improve the delivery of nutrients to the skin cells.

Increased circulation can also help to reduce the appearance of cellulite and promote a more toned and sculpted appearance. users often experience a warm, tingling sensation during and after the massage, indicating improved circulation throughout the body.

**Stress reduction:** In addition to the physical benefits, a body scrub massage provides a deeply relaxing and therapeutic experience. The gentle exfoliation, soothing massage techniques, and calming aromatherapy oils can definitely help to reduce stress, ease tension, and promote a sense of well-being.

Many users find that a body scrub massage helps them to disconnect from the stresses of daily life and reconnect with their bodies. The combination of physical and sensory stimuli can create a profound sense of relaxation and rejuvenation.

**Detoxification:** The combination of exfoliation and massage can help to stimulate the body's natural detoxification processes.

The improved circulation and lymphatic drainage will assist in removing toxins and waste products from the skin and underlying tissues. Adding detoxifying essential oils, such as grapefruit or juniper, can further enhance these benefits.**Improved Product Absorption:** By removing the barrier of dead skin cells, a body scrub massage can significantly improve the absorption of other skincare products, such as lotions, creams, and serums.

When you improve the product absorption,hydrating and nourishing ingredients penetrate more deeply into the skin,maximizing their effectiveness. Many users find that their skin feels more hydrated and supple for longer after a body scrub, especially when paired with a high-quality moisturizer.

1mr9d6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/1mr9d6j/i_dont_really_know_anymore_tbh_theres_a_bit_of/,I don't really know anymore tbh there's a bit of everything but mostly loneliness and suspicion of undiagnosed neurodivergency I guess ?,"I (25M) have been single my whole life, never dated anybody and I am afraid It might stay like this because I am functionally unable to flirt. 

First topic : friends since I'm pretty sure this'll be brought up at some point, I do have a few friends which are scattered all over the country so I see them on rare occasions. Half of them are from high school, the second half is from my Master's courses. I have absolutely failed to build any lasting friendship between 2017 and 2023.

I have been studying since I got out of HS (with some summer jobs, internships and last year was 4 month uni/8 month working for a shitty pharmaceutics lab), currently doing a PhD in food science so I have pretty much never been able to unwind fully because work is never really over. 

Basically my life is get up>go to work>work>go back home>distract myself for a bit with the current hyperfixation, eat>sleep rince and repeat every day (as for most of us I guess). Groceries and house cleaning on weekends which takes like half a day (as for most of us I guess). 

I tried a few times to get on dating apps but never really kept logging in past a week, for 2 reasons: first the heavy emphasis on appearance felt extremely reductive and second I didn't really happen to match with people and when I did it felt very forced and I panicked and didn't know what to say to the person I matched with. I must say I have a very hard time with social skills in general, feeling comfortable around people takes me 7-8 month of *daily interactions* on average I'd say (this is not an immutable law of nature of course there have been a few people I have been able to connect almost instantly with but never really in durable way). This is part of why I suspect undiagnosed neurodivergency along with other behaviours (hating tight clothes, can't bear the feeling of grease on my hands to the point I never eat crisps if I am not at home or know I have a faucet nearby I can use, general social awkwardness, extreme anxiety regarding transportation [if I have to take a train I will be at the station 40min early because anything later gives me massive anxiety]) that my brother has been bringing up as being ""on the spectrum"" 

Going out on my own feels weird but I still do occasionally treat myself to some smoothies/coffee/sweets or going to the restaurant [this became more and more uncomfortable as time went by so now I mostly do takeout or delivery when I do] and I would absolutely never talk to a stranger there because I have no idea if they are open to me talking to them or not [preshoting this one since most people tell me to ""go to the bar and talk to people"" which is always baffling since in my mind it is almost equal to harassment].

Most of my hobbies were there from the beginning 
: things like video-games, manga, anime, series, movies, music which is great because I get to experience so many stories that moved me in so many ways but they are also very isolating since most of them require me to be home.

On flirting inability : every depiction I have witnessed of flirt has seemed to me a lot like sexual harassment which I don't want any part in so I don't really know what to do.

Anyways, sorry for bothering you but posting on the internet is so much easier than talking, I get to organise my thoughts even though it ends up being all over the place again but at least I do not seem like an utter fool.

At least this situation presents the advantage of not making someone wait for me when lab hours get long (not that I think anyone deserves to waste time waiting for me anyways) but yeah, I'd like to feel how it's like having someon special and being special to someone, must be nice not being alone, especially when the world seems as fucked as it seems right now",1,1755289728.0,MentalHealthSupport,0,1.0,False

**Why Host Remote-Working World Cup Fans?**

Remote-working fans are a unique and lucrative audience. They travel longer, spend more time in one place and seek accommodations with reliable workspaces. Here’s why you should prepare your rental for them:

*  **Massive Market & Growing Demand** – Digital nomadism has grown by over 147 % since 2019. Fans traveling for World Cup matches will need a base for weeks or even months. Hosting these guests fills your calendar and provides steady income. Learn more about maximizing earnings in our Benefits of Listing on Llivo guide.
*  **Longer Stays = Less Turnover** – Remote workers often book extended trips so they can attend multiple matches and explore the city. Longer stays mean fewer cleanings, fewer check-ins and more predictable revenue.
*  **Premium Rates for Productivity** – Digital nomads are willing to pay more for reliable internet and comfortable workspaces. Position your property as a “remote-ready” rental and justify higher nightly rates. See how our Work-Friendly Rentals page inspires hosts to upgrade their spaces.
*  **Personalized Hospitality Pays Off** – Offering a home office, quiet zones and even optional airport pickup can earn rave reviews. A positive stay encourages repeat visits and referrals. Read about Llivo’s community approach in the [Story of Llivo](https://www.llivo.com/p/story-of-llivo).

Digital nomads crave flexibility and authenticity — exactly what Llivo hosts provide. By serving this market, you help travelers thrive while boosting your own earnings.



**Designing a Remote-Ready Rental**

To attract remote-working fans, your space needs more than a comfortable bed. Focus on functionality, comfort and a hint of home:

**High-Speed Internet & Tech**

* 🛜 **Reliable Wi-Fi** – High-speed internet is non-negotiable. Test your connection and mention speeds in your listing. Provide an ethernet cable as a backup and ensure strong signals throughout the property. In case of outages, share information on nearby co-working spaces or coffee shops.
*  **Plentiful Outlets & Chargers** – Equip the workspace with multiple power outlets and USB ports. A desk lamp with built-in charging can be a thoughtful touch.

**Dedicated Workspaces & Comfort**

*  **Separate Office Area** – Create a distinct workspace with a sturdy desk and an ergonomic chair. Even a nook with good lighting and minimal distractions can help guests focus. A comfortable chair and proper monitor height reduce fatigue and support productivity.
*  **Noise-Control & Rest Areas** – Provide noise-reducing curtains, rugs or carpets to absorb sound. Good sleep matters too — invest in quality mattresses, blackout curtains and extra pillows. For more ideas, browse our Explore Remote Work Stays page.
*  **Office Essentials** – Stock basics like pens, notepads, sticky notes and a printer or portable scanner. A whiteboard or corkboard can also help guests organize tasks.

**Sustainability & Smart Amenities**

*  **Eco-Friendly Upgrades** – Many digital nomads value sustainability. Incorporate LED lighting, refillable toiletry dispensers and recycling bins, as recommended in our Sustainable Tourism resources.
*  **Smart Home Features** – Install smart thermostats and energy-efficient appliances. Guests appreciate climate control that adapts to their schedule and saves energy. These upgrades also lower your utility bills.

By showcasing these features in your photos and description, you signal that your space is a productive, comfortable and sustainable choice.



**Commuting & Connectivity: Helping Guests Work and Play**

Remote-working fans need to switch seamlessly between laptop and stadium. Here’s how you can support their mobility:

*  **Offer Llivo’s Pick-and-Drop Service** – Provide optional airport pickup and local drop-offs so guests arrive stress-free and always make kickoff. Learn how you can earn extra by driving in our Host Drive & Earn program.
*  **Highlight Public Transit & Bike-Share** – Research nearby transit stations and bike-share docks, and include this information in your welcome message. Encourage eco-friendly travel between matches and workspace.
*  **Create a Local Guide** – Compile a digital handbook listing co-working spaces, quiet cafés, libraries and parks. Recommend routes to the stadium and note traffic patterns on match days. If you’re in a multi-city region, mention train or bus connections between host cities.
*  **Flexible Check-In & Storage** – Offer early check-in or late check-out for guests juggling work calls with match schedules. Provide a secure area for luggage if they need to switch venues between cities.

These services demonstrate your commitment to hospitality and help guests make the most of their trip.



**Final Words**

The 2026 World Cup will unite nations and usher in a new era of **work-and-play travel**. Digital nomads are already redefining what it means to live and work on the go, and remote-working fans will be looking for rentals that fit their lifestyle.

1mr99ii,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mr99ii,To double text or not?,"apologies for such a lengthy description but for context, i matched with this guy (he’s 27, i’m 22) on hinge about 2 weeks ago and after a few days of small talk on the app, he got my number and we met up basically the next day. 

he lives about 30-40 minutes away from me. he drove to me and our “date” was just a simple hang out of driving around for hours, drinking coffee and talking. he said he wanted to do something chill for the first time so that i can decide if i like him or not (which was fine with me). anyway, time flew by so quick, it was as though we had known each other for a long time. he took me home, we made out, and he asked to see me the next day (same kind of hangout). 

it seemed like our values and what we were looking for aligned. the next hangout was amazing as well, but what i really appreciated was how he found the time to see me. i say this because he works in car sales (long hours basically everyday) and he’s veryyy busy, and i could tell he was so tired when we hung out, but he said it was worth it to see me even just for a little bit. he was very consistent in the way that he texted (he would consistently take a couple hours but his messages were thoughtful and he made a lot of effort to keep the convo flowing with meaningful conversation). he also was very affectionate physically, and verbally (in person and over text). 

its been a week now since i last saw him and i just don’t know what to think of his absence for what is now basically 2 days. 

i’ve only know of this man for like 2 weeks so i dont expect much from him but i would like to think that theres a chance he has a valid reason for not responding. otherwise i have to accept i’ve been ghosted ig🧍🏽‍♀️

i already double texted because im not the type to be ashamed of going after what i want. but at this point, i think i should stay silent and hope he responds? but another part of me wants to double text and say something like “or don’t😝.”

In late 2022 I entered into a relationship with a friend and it lasted around 5 months. She ended it. That left me heartbroken. Anyhow, pulled myself from that pit and when life was getting normal again, entered a batchmate from college. She Initiated conversations, calls etc. We both knew that we liked each other but one fated day I told her something about her friend circle (which was true) and the next day her whole friend circle confronted me and she seemed as if she was neutral but tilted towards them. I stopped talking to her and she reciprocated it. Fine.

In mid 2024, I got into fashion and skin care which when added to my height 6'2, gave me a glowup. Then, one fine day, the popular girl in my batch, sat beside me and initiated a conversation. My hopes were kindled. I went on to emotionally drain myself with every micro actions of her. I could see her friends teasing her by my name and stuff like that. One day we even went out (very casually) but nothing could come out of it. Fine again. College ended. I moved on.

Last month enrolled myself in a coaching. I had improved my dressing style even more and that skincare routine started manifesting itself more prominently. I begin getting 3× times more attention. On an odd day, while leaving the class I caught a girl checking me out. I brushed it off. Another, random day we both shared a coincidental eye contact. I decided to sit in her vicinity and try striking a conversation. I did and it went good. Next day she seemed cold but I sensed, she was still checking on me. After the class, I did THAT (first time). I asked her for a coffee and she told me a personal pre occupation with something. It wasn't a no or yes. She came back to the class but I have stopped sitting in her vicinity and hence no interaction whatsoever. In all this time I am getting attention from others in the batch. My issue? I feel that since my breakup, I am stuck in a loop where even though I am getting a fair share of opposite gender attraction but no tangible outcomes or manifestations are coming out of the same.

My query: Is it because of that breakup or something wrong in my behaviour or it's natural?

TL:DR: Since my breakup in early 2023. I am getting fair amount of opposite gender attraction but nothing meaningful is coming out of it. Whenever I approach someone things usually gets messed up. Confused and anxious regarding the same.",1,1755289415.0,TeenIndia,8,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

the selection of a nugget ice maker depends on several factors, including ice production capacity, water reservoir size, ease of use, and cleaning requirements. The following are some of the key features to consider when evaluating nugget ice makers.

**Ice production Capacity:**

The ice production capacity determines how much nugget ice the machine can produce in a 24-hour period.This is typically measured in pounds (lbs) or kilograms (kg). For home use, a machine producing 20-30 lbs of ice per day may be sufficient, while commercial settings may require machines capable of producing 50 lbs or more.The rate of ice production is also a crucial factor, indicating how quickly the machine can produce a batch of ice.

**Water Reservoir Size:**

The water reservoir size dictates how frequently enough the ice maker needs to be refilled. A larger reservoir means less frequent refills, which can be especially convenient for households or businesses that use a lot of ice. The reservoir material is also significant; BPA-free plastic is a common and safe choice. Some models offer direct water line connections, eliminating the need for manual refills altogether.

**Ease of Use and Controls:**

A user-friendly interface is essential for convenient operation. Look for models with intuitive controls, clear displays, and simple settings. Some ice makers feature advanced controls such as timers, self-cleaning cycles, and automatic shut-off functions.Consider models with indicator lights or alerts that signal when the ice bin is full or when the water level is low.

**Cleaning and Maintenance:**

Regular cleaning is vital to maintain the hygiene and performance of an ice maker.Models with self-cleaning cycles can significantly reduce manual effort. Removable parts, such as the ice bin and water reservoir, make cleaning easier. Consider the frequency with which the machine needs to be cleaned and whether it requires any special cleaning solutions.

**Size and Design:**

The physical dimensions of the ice maker are important, especially if space is limited. Countertop models are generally smaller and more portable, while under-counter or freestanding models offer larger ice production capacities. Consider the overall design and aesthetics of the machine to ensure it complements your kitchen or bar area.

**Noise Level:**

The noise level of an ice maker can be a significant factor, especially for home use. Look for models that operate quietly, especially if thay will be placed in living areas or near bedrooms. Noise levels are typically measured in decibels (dB), with lower numbers indicating quieter operation.

## Core Benefits

Nugget ice makers offer several compelling benefits, making them a valuable addition to both residential and commercial settings. here are some of the key advantages of owning a nugget ice maker.

**Superior Ice Quality:**

Nugget ice is prized for its soft, chewable texture and its ability to absorb flavors in beverages.Its unique shape allows it to cool drinks quickly without diluting them excessively. this makes it a popular choice for cocktails, iced coffee, and other refreshing drinks. The porous nature of nugget ice also makes it ideal for use in healthcare settings, where patients may find it easier to consume than hard, solid ice cubes.

**Enhanced Convenience:**

Having a nugget ice maker at home or in your business eliminates the need to purchase bags of ice from the store. This saves time and money,and it ensures that you always have a supply of fresh,clean nugget ice on hand. Models with large water reservoirs or direct water line connections further enhance convenience by reducing the need for frequent refills.

**Versatile Applications:**

Nugget ice has a wide range of applications beyond just beverages. It can be used to keep seafood fresh, to relieve sore throats, or to soothe minor injuries. Its soft texture makes it safe for use in blenders and other appliances. The versatility of nugget ice makes it a valuable asset in various settings, from homes and restaurants to healthcare facilities and retail stores.

**Reduced Water Waste:**

Some nugget ice makers are designed to minimize water waste, using more efficient freezing processes. Look for models that recycle unused water back into the reservoir or that offer features such as automatic shut-off to prevent overproduction. This can definitely help conserve water and reduce your environmental impact.

**Improved Customer Satisfaction (For Business):**

In restaurants,bars,and other hospitality businesses,serving drinks with nugget ice can significantly improve customer satisfaction. The unique texture and flavor-absorbing properties of nugget ice can enhance the overall drinking experience, leading to repeat business and positive reviews. Investing in a quality nugget ice maker can be a smart way to elevate your establishment's offerings.

## FAQs Section

**how long does it take to make a batch of nugget ice?**

The time it takes to make a batch of nugget ice varies depending on the model and the ambient temperature. Moast nugget ice makers can produce their first batch of ice in 15-30 minutes, with subsequent batches produced more quickly. Some high-end models can produce ice even faster.**How often do I need to clean my nugget ice maker?**

The frequency of cleaning depends on the water quality and the usage of the machine. As a general rule, it's an excellent idea to clean your nugget ice maker at least onc a month. If you notice any buildup of scale or mineral deposits,you may need to clean it more frequently.

**What type of water should I use in my nugget ice maker?**

Unfortunately very relatively new to learning about financial planning and very behind. After finding this sub, was hoping the “not rich yet” part of the acronym would mean that I’d be in similar company here, but reading through the posts, definitely further back than most posters.

Combined income between my fiancé (30) and I (34) is >$400k/year, but the lifestyle creep has gotten us slowly over the years and I’ve realized very late that I’m fairly behind in saving. We live in a VHCOL area, and while rent was cheap when we moved during covid, rent+utilities has slowly crept up to ~$6.5k/month. Monthly expenses, rent/utilities included, have crept up to $15k-20k/month.

Top it off, it looks like I’m likely going to be moving jobs soon and taking at least a 10% pay cut from $365k to ~$315-$330k.

We got very complacent, and never really learned about careful financial planning growing up, so I only have about $82k across retirement accounts, and together we have about $75k in HYSA for emergencies. 

Still have ~$135k in student loans at about 6.5% interest on average. 

Obviously I’m looking to cut costs quickly and ramp up savings. Current gameplan is first lowering retirement contributions to build out cash on hand savings to ~6mo/living expenses (~$120k), then redirecting savings back to maxing out retirement (hopefully before the end of the year in time to max this years contributions) then just going the bogglehead investment strat.

Our lease isn’t up until April, but other highest priority is moving, which it seems like we can potentially save $1-2k/mo on rent, and hoping utilities drop if we’re somewhere with more efficient A/C and fewer windows.  

Also need to find some activities that aren’t $22 cocktails on the weekends. 

I assume “make sure you’re budgeting carefully and building out your emergency savings, retirement accounts, and then investments” is entirely too 101 for anyone that’s found themselves in this sub, but thought I’d share.

EDIT: Thanks for the replies. Agreed that hoarding cash is stupid, as is cutting retirement, but that’s a temporary measure to build up emergency savings because there’s a reasonable chance I get laid off in the next 3-9months, and want to ensure I have cash on hand in case it takes longer than anticipated to find a new job (actively interviewing now).

Also agreed that cutting spending is the #1 priority. Know the spend is egregious, hence the post title, but absolute deserve the shocked/horrified responses.

For clarity on spend, the problem is going out to eat, delivery, and cocktail bars. July was $13k in spend - $6k rent, $1.3k student loans, $900 restaurants, $800 pets (normal food, a surprise vet bill, insurance), $600 in credit card annual fees hitting, $550 on bars (we took a trip on points, so higher spend month on food/drink), $500 on utilities, $400 on trip expenses (museums mostly), $600 between groceries/work cafeteria/coffee. 

EDIT #2: I think the “$15k-$20k/mo” was an overstatement. I looked too quickly at our joint budgeting app and took into account (1) a month where I dumped money into my HSA for last tax year before the deadline, (2) another month where I threw an extra $5k at my highest interest student loan, and (3) a couple months where my SO had a back injury and had regular expensive physical therapy appointments.",18,1755289123.0,HENRYfinance,35,0.85,False

1mr90st,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermiculture/comments/1mr90st/doubts_of_a_newbie/,Doubts of a newbie.,"Hello everyone! Thanks for your time!

I started growing worms by accident in a big waste bag put inside another big waste bag to store horse manure for my compost and plants. (No garden, just a 12 m² terrace full of pots in various sizes from 40 litre to 140 litre.)  
I got my hands on some horse manure that aged already a couple months, maybe a year or two, hard to say, directly on the soil in the countryside. So, in hindsight it is obvious, there were worms and eggs in there. When I got hold of that horse manure in March and realized what chance I had there, I had to dig through the whole thing and if I was lucky I would find 2 worms. But I was not in any stress. 2 worms can populate the world. (Also it is likely there were more worms. Just not enough for me to find. Aswell as eggs.) So I started doing recherche, watching youtube videos, reading articles, learning more and more, caring for them, feeding them. Now in August I take the roof off (2 empty bags formerly holding bought soil. Used as protection from direct sunlight and rain.) I can already see worms. and when I dig a bit there are worms everywhere aswell as quite a lot of their remains! (No horse manure anymore though. All gone.)

So far to my experience growing worms.

I wanted to grow worms and get their poop indoors. Because outside they might not survive winter. I will try my best obviously to protect them from the cold but it is definately a risk. Anyway. I think it was the 6th of August that I bought 4 50 litre boxes which are now standing in my kitchen. They are transparent so I taped the walls with newspapers. By that time I already had a lot of paper waste prepared because I always have paper waste prepared for my outdoor worms. That amounted to... less than half of the 200 litres I had to fill. But that below half I already put in, dampened it, mixed in a bit of coffee grounds, giving bacteria and funghi a chance to start populating the inside of the boxes before my new worms would arrive. Later I ordered around 1,000 worms, a mix of eisenia fetida, andrei and hortensis, (1 kg) and they arrived yesterday. (14th of August) So that was around 8 days the bacteria and funghi had a headstart. In the meantime I filled all the boxes almost to the top with shredded cardboard and also put some grounded up eggshells in there and mixed it in the top layer. (Not JUST shredded cardboard. There are pieces of various sizes I ripped apart by hand and some pieces that I just rolled so the worms have a tunnel to crawl through. hehe Also ripped apart newspapers, handkerchiefs and what not.)  
I let them in the box for around 7 hours, laying on the kitchen floor so they could acclimate to the temperatures in my kitchen where they should spend the rest of their lifes. After that I spilled the worms with the substrate they came in on cardboard and did my best to somewhat evenly divide them, aswell as their substrate, into the 4 boxes. Same thought as before with the outside worms. At start they don't have to be many. They will multiply on their own to a population fitting the size of the boxes. When I put them onto the surface of the shredded cardboard they digged in really fast. I think in around 10 seconds most of them were not visible anymore. So they were alive, healthy and all after the transport. I guess. Alive, sure. Healthy? I hope.

I am a very curious guy. When I noticed the growth in population outside I could not hold back annoying my worms way too often. I want to see them, I want to know how they are doing. After a while I learned to hold back and let them be except feeding them 1-3 times a month and maybe checking once between the feedings for humidity and such. But with my indoor bins I now encounter the same problem! Although I gotta say it was not a problem immediatly as I noticed some worms climbing the walls. Not many. Not dozens or hundreds so from what I have read those are just some adventurous individuals, not a fleeing movement. For now I have the lid on but with room for airflow. And it was that room for airflow around 5 worms ""wanted"" to go out. I also found one worm outside of the bins. Put it back in immediatly.  
With time I will drill holes in the sides or maybe in the lid (As they are in my kitchen, so no worry about rain.) and put a fly screen over them. But for now I do not have that possibility.

For the night I let the lids off and the light on because I did not want to wake up with worms on my ktichen floor or maybe they would use those hours to crawl into the living room and if I wouldn't accidentally find them they would die.. :I  
Today morning I found my solution for now, to put a layer of dry shredded cardboard ontop of the wet shredded cardboard as a barrier. My thought was that if the problem were just some adventurous individuals they wouldn't want to venture through 1-2 cm dry cardboard but rather stay below in the wet substrate but if there was a problem with their new home they would feel forced to venture even through that. So I did this today in the morning. It is now night. So far it worked. Every couple hours I take off the lid to look if a worm or two are trying to escape but nothing. I search the floor for escaped worms, nothing. I digged a bit, maybe 5 cms deep, today to, for the first time, introduce a bit of food (Really small serving. Around 1/4 of a banana peel divided into the 4 boxes so.. 1/16 of a banana peel per box.) I often have read and heard that beginners tend to feed too much too soon and it is better to start with not enough food and work your way up.  
Anyway. As I am checking every couple hours for worms climbing up the walls, altough today I never caught a single one, I am anxious. What if they would NOT feel forced to go through the layer of dry cardboard even if their situation below is critical? Am I doing the right thing? Are they ok?  
I think best for now is to just let them be, get accustomed to their new homes and just stay away. But I have to check. I have to see. I have to know. I can also lift up the boxes and look into it from below. (Remember, the boxes are transparent. I taped newspapers onto the sides to block light but not the bottom. The lid is not transparent btw.) I see some worms between the bottom and the cardboard but most of them do not move around much. I can see through the bottom that the cardboard down there is very wet but I think if that is a problem for the worms they would just crawl up where it is wet but less wet? Or not? When I digged a little into the substrate the worms up there seem to be active. It does not take long for them to dig themselfs in again to escape the light. Or maybe the ones on the bottom are the eisenia hortensis and the ones below the surface the fetida and andrei? As far as I am informed the hortensis like to dig deeper than the fetida and andrei. The boxes are around 30 cm deep/high.

Well. That was a wall of text I did not expect myself. Thanks again for your time! I hope all I need is people telling me I am a good boy and just let them be but I tried to write everything in detail in hopes that if I did something wrong more experienced people can tell me exactly that.

Thinking about trying to suggest some new routes, maybe ones further afield that require a bit more planning, just to shake things up. Or perhaps organizing a special themed ride, costume optional.

1mr8xsg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mr8xsg,Help with dining/kitchen layout situation,"Welcome to our dining/kitchen situation. 

In the few years we have lived here, my husband and I have tried our best to design this small space with minimal resources to maximize its ability to store items, have useable counter space, and seat us and the occasional couple of friends. It’s a tight fit.

We are renters, and our landlords are about to undertake an unfortunately necessary remodel that will affect the back wall of the “dining” space, for the second time. There will be a door installed on the wall, and there will exist a kind of in-between rooms hotel door situation. The door is not intended to be used, it’s only a solution to get around a code violation—a long story. They are fine with us blocking the door after it’s installed. 

I think the best way to respond to this situation is to try to find a better way to design the space. 

Though we’ve managed to eek enough function out of it, I have a growing beef with the following aspects: the stools are bulky and uncomfortable, (I’ve started avoiding them altogether in favor of the couch in the other room); the island, while efficient, is uninviting to sit at unless it’s extended (as it is now), which makes it huge and hard to walk around; the hodgepodge cabinet + hutch situation is simply maddening to look at; everything now feels too farmhouse grey because of the new floors (or maybe it already was and I’m finally seeing it). 

Here are my current redesign ideas: 

Solid wood credenza/sideboard cabinet with good storage that’s about as wide as the left wall to replace the hodgepodge cabinet/hutch situation. This would provide a more cohesive working counter space. 

Upholstered flip top storage benches in the right corner for seating. Looking for something with a back so people aren’t resting against the wall. I’m imagining a banquette sort of set up, but without the corner piece. I’m thinking a floor lamp would be best in the corner—it gets pretty dark back there. 

Thinking maybe more floating shelves on the back wall? I can’t overemphasize our desperate need for more storage. 

Replace the island with an oval or rounded rectangular table. No storage underneath, so everyone’s knees get to survive, but hopefully it would be useful for food prep if needed. 

If there is room on the right wall next to the dining bench, I’d add a small cabinet as a mini coffee bar. Not sure there will be space for this, though. 

Please hit me up with your ideas, let me know if I’m on the right track or if you have advice for a different setup. It’s rough out here! 

One thing that I’m having a hard time finding is the bench seating option I’m imagining. West Elm has an option (link below), but I’m worried it will not deliver on quality or comfort despite the price. If anyone has a good idea where to find something like this, or has another idea entirely, I’d love to hear it. 

“Dining room” dimensions:
Right wall: 92” (7’ 8”)
Back wall (cuts off at curtains): 76” (6’ 4”)
Left wall (cuts off a bit before curtains): 72” (6’)
Length between right and left wall: 132” (11’)

If anyone is wondering what’s behind the curtains, our washer and dryer and hot water heater live there, so that area needs to be accessible. 

Side note: the vinyl floors used to be a neutral beige, but they had to be replaced last year since they began to fail. The manufacturer only had grey tones in stock to replace them with, so that’s what we ended up with.
