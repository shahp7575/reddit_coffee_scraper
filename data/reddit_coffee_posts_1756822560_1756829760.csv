1n6nrfg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n6nrfg,Need advice on making my living room cozier (5x3m layout with photos),"Hi everyone,
I’m looking for some advice on how to improve my living room setup. The space is about 5x3 meters and it’s open to the hallway/entrance. I’ve attached a few photos so you can get an idea of how it looks now.

I’m planning to:

Replace the TV stand.

Add an L-shaped sofa (the kind where you can stretch your legs out) with the long side positioned under the windows.

Swap the table in the back for a convertible coffee/dining table, which I’d place between the sofa and the TV.


I’d really appreciate any tips or ideas on how to make the space feel cozier and better organized. Thanks y'all!",1,1756829533.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False
1n6nrfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundShape/comments/1n6nrfe/why_are_microsoft_surface_headphones_the_best/,Why Are Microsoft Surface Headphones the Best Over Ear Pick,"Having spent a solid few weeks using the Microsoft Surface Headphones, I can confidently say these over-ear headphones left quite an impression on me. As someone who often juggles work calls, podcasts, and some badly danced-to Spotify tracks, finding headphones that balance performance, comfort, and functionality can be tricky. These headphones seem ambitious, but let’s dive into their reality to see how they stack up.

**Build Quality and Design**  
The first thing that grabbed my attention with these headphones is the design. Sleek, minimalist, and unmistakably modern—they’re just the kind of gadget that feels fancy to pull out in a coffee shop. The matte finish feels premium, though I do worry about scuffs over time. The adjustable headband and cushioned ear pads made for a comfortable wear, even during my all-day marathon gaming stint where the longest break I took was to microwave leftovers. The lightweight structure helps it stay cozy, but I wouldn’t call it feather-light. My occasional concern lies in how durable the headband feels. A coworker who borrowed them insisted on stretching them more than I’d have preferred, and I was close to holding my breath.  

**Audio Performance**  
Testing the audio quality was a delight on these! The headphones deliver crisp, clean sound with Omnisonic Audio technology that genuinely envelopes you in your playlist or shows. Every bass note or beat drop during a shuffle through my favorite tracks was immersive. I even tried squeezing in a few classical tunes, and to my surprise, the sound clarity handled orchestras beautifully. Watching Netflix or gaming was equally satisfying, where sound effects were sharp. The audio escapism here is real. Though, at the peak sound levels, it occasionally veered towards being a bit piercing, reminding me to dial it back.  

**Hear What You Want, Ignore the Rest**  
Noise-cancelation—now here lies its charm. These headphones come with 30 dB active noise cancellation and an additional 40 dB passive noise-blocking feature. During a particularly loud construction day in my neighborhood, I decided to test the limits, and wow, it had me cocooned in silence. However, the adjustable knobs on-ear let me lower the cancellation level conveniently to jump into conversations without needing to wrestle the headphones off my head. That feature might have saved my relationship with my talkative roommate, especially when they wanted random life updates mid-session.

**Integrated Assistant for the Win**  
Honestly, having Cortana built into the headphones felt a little futuristic at times. I used voice controls to skip songs, adjust volume, and even set a reminder when I was busy doodling rather than writing down notes. The microphone was stellar at picking up my voice, even amidst some background noise. It works smoothly with iOS, Windows 10, MacOS, and Android devices, which is a rare jackpot in compatibility. Cortana's interactions were slightly clunky with non-Windows ecosystems, though, feeling like she preferred playing on her home turf.  

**Upsides**  
- Clean and premium design that matches a modern aesthetic.  
- Outstanding Omnisonic Audio for enjoyable listening sessions.  
- Adjustable active noise cancellation for different environments.  
- Comfortable fit for extended use, especially with breathable ear cushions.  
- Cortana integration works as a great hands-free bonus.  

**Bad Points**  
- Feels potentially fragile when handled too roughly, especially the headband.  
- Occasionally harsh at peak audio levels without adjustments.  
- Cortana’s performance isn’t equally great across non-Windows ecosystems.  

**Battery Life and Everyday Usability**  
Regarding battery life, I managed to squeeze out long stretches of binge-listening before plugging them in again. They held up well for office work, some gaming, and daily workouts with slight battery anxiety only creeping up after full days of continuous use. The USB-C charging is swift, which is another thumbs-up from me. Oh, and the audio automatically pauses when you take them off—definitely one of those little touches that made me whisper “nice” to myself.  

**Product Contenders**  
The first comparison that sprang to my mind was with Bose’s QuietComfort 700 and Sony WH-1000XM4. While Sony offers a superior noise-cancellation experience, it lacks the Microsoft Surface Headphones' unique on-ear dials for adjusting sound and noise-cancellation. On the other hand, QuietComfort 700 feels slightly sturdier when it comes to build quality. Price-wise, these headphones often fall competitively in between the other two, making them a solid mid-tier choice. Microsoft’s slightly niche Cortana tie-in does give it an edge if you're deep in the Windows ecosystem, but if Apple is your jam, you might get annoyed by some occasional hiccups.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering their feature set, these headphones provide admirable value. The Omnisonic Audio creates a superb surround-sound-like experience, while adjustable noise cancellation is a dream come true. If there’s room for improvement, it would mainly be in maximizing the product’s durability to stay in league with its competitors and enhancing their performance across all operating systems. For something priced in this range, they cater to productivity enthusiasts, casual music junkies, and tech explorers alike.

1n6npep,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1n6npep/does_the_waterdrop_wda1b_replacement_filter_truly/,Does the Waterdrop WD-A1-B replacement filter truly enhance water taste? Review,"**Waterdrop WD-A1-B: Tested and Reviewed for Everyday Use**

Using the Waterdrop WD-A1-B replacement water filter has been a game-changer in maintaining better-tasting, cleaner water at home. This compact yet powerful 3-in-1 filter integrates seamlessly with the Waterdrop WD-G3P600 and other compatible reverse osmosis systems. It promises improved water quality paired with outstanding ease of use, and I was eager to see if it lives up to its reputation. After weeks of testing this product, I found plenty to love—and some things to keep in mind.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right out of the box, the replacement filter feels well-made. The material, a superior coconut shell-activated carbon block, is thoughtfully designed, adding both functionality and eco-friendliness. I’ve tested a lot of water filters, and the compact dimensions (18.3"" x 7.8"" x 17.1"") of this one fit snugly in smaller under-sink spaces. Its external certification (it’s NSF/ANSI certified) gave me extra confidence about the credibility of its filtering capabilities. Not to mention, the filter boasts a sleek and straightforward aesthetic that doesn’t scream “tech overload” under your sink.

**Performance and Filtration Efficiency**

In my tests, the Waterdrop WD-A1-B shone through in performance. It efficiently reduced rust, particulates, and other impurities like sand—all effortlessly. I could taste a noticeable improvement in the freshness of the water compared to my previous standard carbon filter. The manufacturer claims it removes chlorine odor as well, which I found to be accurate. My water no longer carried that faint pool-water scent it had before using this setup. It worked wonders during filter-intensive tasks like making coffee or hot tea where water quality becomes really obvious.

[Check Waterdrop WD-A1-B price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b07wzdlnly/)

**Upsides**

- Long-lasting: This filtration system provides clean water for an entire year, saving both money and frequent hassle.  
- Easy installation: A simple three-second twist was all it took to replace the old filter, no tools or professionals required—seriously convenient.   
- Superior material: The activated carbon block, derived from natural coconut shells, is effective and sustainable.  
- Improves taste: The smaller pore size helps absorb residual chlorine odors and organic materials exceptionally well.  

**Potential Areas for Improvement**

- Bulk packaging: A more eco-conscious approach to packaging might be a future upgrade.  
- Allergies to coconut: Since the carbon block uses coconut shells, those with allergies should tread cautiously and possibly seek alternatives.  
- Limited compatibility scope: While it works perfectly with compatible Waterdrop reverse osmosis models, it won't fit other systems—so you're locked into their ecosystem.

**Ease of Use and Versatility**

Replacing the filter was incredibly intuitive—honestly, I was shocked it was done so quickly. Just a twist and a click, and you’re set for the next 12 months. Unlike filters that leave you fumbling with complicated additions or extra tools, this one keeps it simple. I also appreciated the compact build, leaving plenty of space under the sink for cleaning supplies or random things that end up there (looking at you, stockpiled grocery bags).

**Strengths Against Competitors**

This product isn’t the only kid on the block when it comes to reverse-osmosis water filtration. Brands like Brita and iSpring come to mind. Compared to Brita, the Waterdrop filter lasts significantly longer and doesn’t require frequent replacements. iSpring offers compatibility with a broader range of systems, which can be a plus for homeowners who don't stick to one brand. However, it doesn’t quite match Waterdrop’s focused precision in taste enhancement and compact design. While Waterdrop may lack some flexibility in system compatibility, its superior filtration performance, eco-friendly materials, and longevity make it a standout choice.

**Price Performance**

Considering the built-in benefits and quality performance, the product offers a competitive price-to-quality ratio. Cheaper alternatives like generic water filters simply don’t match its combination of ease of installation, longevity, and filtration efficiency. Sure, initial costs might look higher, but when stretched out over the year and compared to efficiency levels, the return on investment is clear. Rather than multiple low-grade replacements, you're looking at a one-and-done solution.

Hey y'all! It's time for our annual housekeeping post :) There's a few more action items at the bottom of the post, but I wanted to prioritize making a little guide for job seekers so they get the most out of using this sub as part of their job search. 

**What I've noticed:** 

Many posts by job seekers, both on this sub and on the Raleigh/Triangle general subs, are skeletal and contain very little, if any, information about the job seeker's background and experience, focusing instead on the sorts of jobs they're looking for or sticking to just a general ""who's hiring?"" These posts are rarely useful and don't get much traction. 

**What local recruiters & employers find most helpful:** 

More information about you! We don't expect you to post your full resume for all to see, but we probably won't reach out to a random screen name who just says ""anyone hiring?"" unless we know a little more about your experience and credentials. You can keep it high level (""I've mostly worked in food service, back of house"") or you can get granular (""I did the barista training through Wake Tech's hospitality program, spent 5 years as a barista for a national chain, and now am the shift manager for a local coffee shop""). Any other preferences are helpful too (pay, benefits, schedule, location, etc.). None of this is required and your post won't be removed if you don't include this, but it certainly helps! Consider using the below format to structure your [FOR HIRE] post: 

* What I'm looking for:

* My relevant experience and training: 

* Additional info: (put pay needs, location, or any other information here!)

**About personal information / resumes:** 

While the sub doesn't bar folks from sharing personal contact information or full resumes in posts, we do discourage it. Most of Reddit, including this sub, is part of the open web, so it's viewable by anyone without an account, and despite the API changes is still scraped on occasion. Users are encouraged to share personal identifying information via Reddit's private chat system instead of in posts or comments. If you do want to share contact information in a post or comment, it's recommended to set up a Google Voice number and throwaway email to protect your privacy. You may also want to create a sockpuppet Reddit account to chat with employers and recruiters if your regular account contains content history that includes protected information (like medical or criminal history), NSFW material, or anything else you might want to keep private.

That's it for the quick guide for job seekers! Hope it helps :)

Now onto the rest of the housekeeping--

A few more things of note:

* **On embedding text in image or video files**: If your job listing or resume is embedded in an image or video, please consider transcribing it in plain text in the body of the post as well. Text embedded in images or videos is not indexed by Reddit or search engines, which negatively impacts visibility AND rediscoverability. 

* **On self-censorship:** While it's increasingly common for other platforms like Tiktok to shadowban or remove posts and comments that use curse words and similar, this does not apply on TriangleJobs (or on most of Reddit, frankly). All content, (including content caught in our automod filters!) is manually evaluated, and content filtering/removal happens on a case-by-case basis per sub rules and automod scripts that I made myself. Please refrain from using asterisks or intentional misspellings to censor your posts and comments, as it reduces the effectiveness of both my moderation tools and individual users' custom content tools.

* **On AI-generated content:** Using generative AI tools to augment your resume or job listing is totally fine! But since this sub is meant for meaningful discussion and for making connections between local employers, job seekers, and recruiters, we do not permit fully AI-generated content or bot account participation. 

* **On subreddit formatting across devices:** Once again, I am a vintage Redditor and interact with Reddit exclusively through my computer in the Old Reddit layout. If there are any glitches or irregularities with the sub on New Reddit, New New Reddit, or the mobile app, please message me so I can fix it because I won't catch it otherwise! 

**As a final reminder:** All job listings must follow federal, state, and local employment laws. This includes laws about what can constitute as a 1099 vs. a W2 employee, laws about what qualifies as an unpaid internship, and laws about minimum wage. The sub also does not permit most commission-only or canvassing work, and only permits volunteer opportunities for nonprofit organizations.

I grew up in Europe, but every year I spend several months here in Morocco because my job allows me to.

I’ve never had much experience when it comes to love (hamdulilah, that’s fine). I often think that sooner or later I’ll have to get married, by my own choice and not because I feel pressured, but I have no idea how to find my future wife. I’m a very private person, I use social media very little, and I don’t really have a social life outside of family.

In the city where I live in Morocco, you can simply stop on a busy street and, without a doubt, a couple of girls (not prostitutes) will hop in with you to go for a coffee or something at a café. To my great surprise, I’ve noticed that catcalling actually works here. But my mind just can’t accept that kind of approach—I simply wouldn’t be able to do it, it feels disrespectful to me.

Another difficulty is that when I’m here I only spend time with family, cousins, and so on. With them I prefer to keep a certain level of respect and privacy, so I never bring up the topic of girls or ask to go out to meet some.

So I find myself stuck in this sort of limbo: on one hand, I want to meet a good Moroccan girl, but on the other hand, I have no idea where to start.

Kraft Heinz splits into two as shifting consumer tastes force a rethink of the 2015 megamerger.

https://preview.redd.it/oom43w27yrmf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1e27af795983ff60a5d39d8cdf53278b1874437

Ten years ago, Kraft and Heinz joined forces to create one of the largest food manufacturers on the planet. The marriage of Heinz ketchup with Kraft Mac & Cheese was supposed to be unstoppable, a merger designed to dominate grocery shelves worldwide. Yet a decade later, the union has unraveled. Consumers moved on, choosing fresh, organic, and less processed options, while Kraft Heinz clung to nostalgia and scale. The company is now splitting into two entities, marking the end of a corporate experiment that never lived up to its promise.

The origins of Kraft Heinz’s megamerger trace back to Warren Buffett and 3G Capital. In 2013, they acquired H.J. Heinz for $23 billion, a deal that instantly signaled ambition. Two years later, they orchestrated a merger with Kraft, creating a $28 billion revenue powerhouse. It was hailed as the fifth-largest food and beverage company in the world, and Wall Street was dazzled. The theory was simple: cost cutting plus brand loyalty would drive lasting profits. But theories rarely hold up when tastes shift as quickly as they did in the 2010s.

**A Decade of Decline**

From the very start, Kraft Heinz struggled with the clash between consumer trends and its traditional offerings. Velveeta, Kool-Aid, Kraft Singles, and Oscar Mayer hot dogs no longer defined dinner tables the way they once did. Health-conscious shoppers wanted fewer preservatives and more authenticity. Store brands offered cheaper alternatives with little noticeable difference. Meanwhile, aggressive cost-cutting stripped away innovation, leaving the company unable to adapt. By 2019, Kraft Heinz was forced to slash the value of its brands by $15.4 billion, an admission that the strategy was failing.

**Buffett’s Disappointment**

Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway owns a 27 percent stake, has openly admitted that he overpaid for Kraft Heinz. The deal, once celebrated, became one of his rare investment missteps. Berkshire has watched its stake lose billions in value as Kraft Heinz stock tumbled nearly 70 percent since the merger. Buffett opposed the split, frustrated both by the $300 million breakup cost and by the decision to exclude shareholders from a vote. Speaking to CNBC, Buffett put it bluntly: “It certainly didn’t turn out to be a brilliant idea to put them together, but I don’t think taking them apart will fix it.” He added that he was disappointed by the move, a rare flash of candor from one of the most patient investors in modern history.

**The Breakup Plan**

Kraft Heinz will divide into two companies. One, temporarily named Global Taste Elevation Co., will focus on high-growth, flavor-driven brands like Heinz sauces, Philadelphia cream cheese, and Kraft Mac & Cheese. The other, called North American Grocery Co., will oversee legacy grocery staples such as Oscar Mayer, Maxwell House, and Lunchables. Carlos Abrams-Rivera, the current CEO, will lead the North American business, while a new leader will be appointed to run the global arm. The split is expected to close in the second half of 2026, with both companies retaining headquarters in Chicago and Pittsburgh.

Kraft Heinz is not alone in its restructuring. Food giants across the industry have been breaking up, chasing agility in a marketplace that punishes sluggish conglomerates. Kellogg split into two, with Mars acquiring its snacks arm. Keurig Dr Pepper announced a similar move, dividing coffee and cold beverages. These separations reflect a broader truth: scale alone no longer guarantees success. Consumers now dictate the market with their wallets, and big food brands must move quickly or risk irrelevance.

For Kraft Heinz, the breakup represents a final attempt at reinvention. By separating high-growth brands from the slower, legacy portfolio, each company can focus on its strengths. Global Taste Elevation can chase international markets hungry for sauces and cream cheese, while North American Grocery can optimize familiar staples for cost-conscious households. Yet questions remain. Can either business reignite excitement in brands that many see as relics of another era? Or is this merely a cosmetic fix for deeper issues that money and restructuring cannot solve?

**Conclusion**

The undoing of the Kraft Heinz merger is more than a corporate maneuver. It’s a symbol of how quickly cultural and culinary tastes evolve, and how even the most iconic brands must keep pace. What began as a marriage of giants ends as a cautionary tale about scale, strategy, and the limits of nostalgia. Kraft Heinz’s next chapter will test whether legacy brands can be reborn or if they will remain reminders of a golden age that has long passed.",1,1756828875.0,Junior_Stocks,0,1.0,False

Here’s how to actually find them.,"Most people look for jobs by updating their LinkedIn profiles and sending out tons of resumes, usually to never hear back. The problem is that up to 70% of jobs are never posted online. This hidden job market is where the best work-from-home opportunities are expected to be in [2025.Here](http://2025.Here)'s how you can access it:

1.  Referrals are very important. People are four times more likely to get hired if someone recommends them. Make a list of companies you want to work for and find at least one current employee to have a coffee chat with once a week. Instead of just asking for a referral, find ways to get involved, have genuine conversations, and show your value.
    
2.  Communities are very valuable. Good jobs often appear in online groups, such as Slack groups (Tech Ladies, Work At Home Hub), and plenty of subreddits, before they are posted for everyone to see.
    
3.  Career pages are often more effective than job boards. Save 10 company pages you like and check their job pages once a week. They often post jobs there before putting them on LinkedIn.
    
4.  Reaching out to companies directly is often effective. Sending a polite email or message to a hiring manager explaining how you can help often gets attention before a job is even open.
    
5.  Use both automation and networking. Do not just apply to hundreds of jobs without thinking or talk to people without following up. The real trick is to do both together.
    

Tools can help:

*   [Maestra](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/maestra-accelerate-your-j/chjedhomjmkfdlgdnedjdcglbakjemlm?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=remotejobs&utm_campaign=hidden_job_market) (disclaimer: it’s mine) → autofill apps across Lever/Greenhouse/Ashby so you can batch-apply 30–50 jobs in minutes.
    
*   If you don’t wish to try mine out, other great alternatives are [Huntr](https://huntr.co/), [Simplify.jobs](http://Simplify.jobs), or [Teal](https://www.tealhq.com/) when it comes to tracking and organization.
    

Bottom line: Stop only competing for jobs on public job boards where there are over 1,000 resumes. The best opportunities are often found in the hidden job market—through referrals, community connections, and direct outreach. Add smart tools to help, and you will get interviews much faster.",2,1756828859.0,WFHJobs,0,1.0,False

I tried giving up coffee 3 years ago before I knew I had pmdd and I only lasted 3 days with having the most horrible withdrawals. Because of this experience, I thought I never could.

What made me finally try again was after I spent an hour on my bedroom floor crying my eyes out in a fetal position before work which happened after drinking coffee.

It’s been 5 weeks since giving up coffee and I have not experienced any mood swings or instability like I was before drinking coffee. I’m not cured at all, but I at least feel better. I described to my therapist the difference in my symptoms:

“On a scale 1-10 where 10 i am spiraling out of control, I am crying uncontrollably and in rage to 1 I am fine, I have been at a baseline of 3.5 and worst at a 5 whereas before when I was drinking coffee, my baseline was always at an 8 and worst was a 10”

What’s helped me more is adjusting to a Mediterranean lifetime because a lot of the foods in this lifestyle has the nutrients we need to help with our symptoms such as magnesium, iron, calcium, Vitamin B6 and Vitamin D!

Just wanted to share this win to help others in giving up caffeine because I swear guys it is a game changer! I appreciate those who shared the advice about caffeine.

Rooting for all of us out there to find some sort of normalcy with this mental disorder that strips us of ourselves. 

PS, provided a few pictures of what I’ve been eating lately. I’m really good at eating the same stuff over and over for awhile but will be trying out different meals to make and will share here!",6,1756828833.0,PMDD,0,1.0,False

Okay, let’s get this out of the way: I didn’t think I’d be back here. Not because I hate dating—okay maybe *a little*—but because swiping, ghosting, and bios written like job interviews are not exactly my idea of romance. Still, here I am, cautiously optimistic and mildly caffeinated.

I’m in my mid-30s, freshly committed to taking better care of myself. That means hitting the gym more days than not, discovering the magic of skincare beyond just washing my face, and generally trying to level up in life (and not just in video games).

Speaking of which—yes, I’m a gamer. Not the “yells at 12-year-olds online” kind, more like “let’s play co-op and talk about life while we explore an open world” kind. I’m also the person who will rewatch an entire movie franchise just to prep for the new one (yes, even if the sequels weren’t great—loyalty is important!).

I’m a homebody at heart who’s learning to balance comfort with growth. I like people who are kind, curious, and emotionally intelligent—or at least trying to be. Bonus points if you know how to cook, laugh at your own jokes, or secretly cry at Pixar movies.

Not looking to rush, but I’m not here to endlessly chat either. If you’re also in that weird-but-exciting space between healing and hoping, let’s talk. Or play a game. Or just awkwardly laugh through an overpriced coffee date.

He then took back the debit card I had and said I would need to provide for myself and the kids from now on. He’s always spent whatever he wants and refuses to give up his spending habits. He will get 2-3 coffees outside a day, takeaways even when I’ve cooked dinner at home or offer leftovers because he won’t touch leftovers, and his haircut every 2 weeks. He also just bought himself customized Ray-bans despite claiming he has no money. And 2 days ago he asked me to loan him 15k. 

I’m the opposite. I come from a family that has always been conservative with money and I won’t buy coffees outside or any extra expenses if I can’t afford to. I’ve kept a savings account from when I still worked 5 years ago but am now having to use that to pay for our kids; food, diapers, and clothes (2nd hand). 

So now for the coffee part. I buy a box of instant coffee (8 sachets in a box) and when my partner is away working it usually lasts me a week. He quite likes them too so drinks them when he’s home. Except he drinks 2 and usually takes one to go which means we go through a box every 2 days. I’ve tried buying more boxes at a time but then he just thinks he can drink even more of them and they disappear faster than I can restock sometimes leaving me with no coffee for myself in the morning. And he will still buy coffee outside even if he has some at home. I’ve tried to speak to him about it and he just says that’s how he lives his life and he isn’t going to change. I’m tired of having to buy these coffees constantly when he’s just going to drink them all so it’s led me to hide a few sachets for myself to enjoy after he leaves in the mornings.

When I first started, I opted for the big-name, all-purpose fertilizers because that’s what everyone recommended. My flowers looked good at first, but I noticed something strange: lots of leafy growth, but not as many blooms. It took me a couple of seasons (and a lot of mistakes) to realize I was feeding them more nitrogen than they needed.

What finally worked for me:

[Fertilizing Flowers With a Hand Sprayer](https://preview.redd.it/sj9s3ykwwrmf1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=71862179a1a58ef52f078fb5eac2bc0e6499e2ab)

1. **Balanced fertilizers with higher phosphorus.** Phosphorus is the “bloom builder,” and I’ve seen dramatic improvements when I use a 5-10-5 or 10-20-10 mix during flowering. My zinnias and marigolds, especially, respond almost overnight with fuller blooms.
2. **Fish emulsion + compost tea.** This is one gardeners don’t talk about enough. I started using it when my grandmother swore by it for her roses, and she was right - it provides a slow, steady feed and makes the petals richer in color.
3. **Slow-release vs. liquid feeding.** For perennials, I’ve learned to stick with slow-release granules in the spring, then supplement with liquid feeds (such as diluted seaweed extract) every couple of weeks during bloom season. Annuals, on the other hand, thrive when I provide consistent liquid feeding.
4. **Soil-first mindset.** Honestly, no fertilizer fixes poor soil. Once I started adding organic matter every fall (compost, shredded leaves, and even coffee grounds), I noticed that I needed less fertilizer overall, and the flowers looked healthier.

Here’s something I haven’t seen discussed much: sometimes the **“best fertilizer” is restraint.** Overfeeding, even with high-quality food, stresses plants and makes them more susceptible to pests. I actually cut back to half-strength doses for my container flowers, and they bloom longer with fewer disease issues.

Every region and garden is different, but these are lessons I wish I had known earlier. Curious to know what fertilizers have you had surprising results with in your own flower beds?

I run a hand through my sandy blonde hair and exhale—my breath stinks of gas station pep pills, fast food, and warm energy drinks. I rub my eyes and stare at the coffee cups crowding the coffee table in front of me. Some are half-full.

They've been cold for hours.

Cans of various energy drinks, the only things not covered in dust, line the mantle, blocking photos of my family—my mom, dad, and me—even my graduation, my first time fishing, and a birthday or two.

The trash can in the kitchen overflows with more. It reeks.

My chest is tight, my head pounds, and my hands won't stop shaking. I reach for another energy drink, cracking the tab open.

It's too loud in the quiet house.

I take a long pull. It burns going down, pinpricks of pain crawl down my throat and settle in my gut.

I stare at the beige walls. They blur, sinking inward, like they're about to fall on me. I shake my head, and when I look back, they're normal, straight, up and down walls. I look at the couch.

*This ugly floral couch my mom gave me looks like piss in the yellow light—the whole room's piss-yellow.*

The fridge kicks on with a hum. My head snaps towards the kitchen. I sink into the couch; muscles loosen; my body becomes heavy.

*These are normal sounds. Safe sounds.*

My eyelids droop.

My body jerks upright, spilling my drink on my jeans.

""Shit,"" I say, but I don't move to clean it. The cold shocks me awake for a second, but the sensation fades; my senses dull. Couch cushions drag me down—my vision blurs. The lamp dims. It's not the bulb; it's me.

The fridge stops humming.

The clock stops ticking.

The house stops creaking.

Silence.

I snap awake, sitting up straight.

Too close.

I take another long pull from my energy drink.

""Stay awake, stay awake,"" I say to myself, and polish off the energy drink before I grab a cup of old coffee from the table. I down it, then jump to my feet and jog in place before I pace the room.

""Three days, seventy-two hours. People have gone longer. Way longer.""

I walk to the kitchen and back. Then spin and back into the kitchen, then back.

I look at my phone. It's 2:47 PM.

""I can do three more hours. Then it'll be light.""

My legs are heavy. Each step takes effort. I trip and my shin cracks against the table. I hit the floor. Hard. The force knocks the half-filled coffee cups over. They spill, soaking into the tan carpet.

""Shit. What a mess.""

I stay down.

The carpet feels nice, and my breath slows. My eyes shut, even though I know better.

Then, I'm there.

I'm floating in a void of indescribable color. It swirls about me, a vibrant, throbbing color. It stings my eyes, but I can't close them; something in the color prevents me. It wants me to look.

A voice sings, low and sorrowful, in a language I can't understand. It has no source, no discernible direction. It's all around me.

More voices join in, and their pain moves through me, reverberating through my bones. My stomach turns. I want to throw up, but I can't.

Then the first voice speaks. Its words cut through the hymnal like a bell. Sharp. Clean. Perfect English.

""Join the many above the world.""

The void is ripped away, and I'm drifting in the infinite blackness of space, high above the Earth and the massive, pulsing ring circling it. From inside the ring, voices cry out, millions of them. Then I see them, swirling liquid forms joined together, not quite human, their faces distorting as they sing.

Suddenly, I'm plummeting downwards towards the ring, and the creatures reach for me. They grab and claw at me, pulling me down to join them. The ring is cold like death.

I scream. My eyes snap open.

I'm on my living room floor. The carpet is wet and cold. My throat's raw.

I sit up. The room is dark—the lights are dead. From the kitchen, I hear the mechanical hum of the fridge motor start, and my body relaxes.

Then I hear something else.

*Crick-crack.*

The sound is muffled, as if it's coming from outside.

*Crick-crick-crack.*

Louder this time, closer. I look towards the corner of the living room. A crack hovers in the air in front of the tall plant in the corner.

*Crick. Crack.*

Bits of reality chip away. And inside the crack is that awful color.

I scoot backwards, my back slamming into the edge of my coffee table. I cry out, a faint, raspy, painful noise.

A dark shape moves within the color—human—almost. Wearing a wide-brimmed hat.

It stares at me with wild, kaleidoscope eyes.

""Go away,"" I say. ""Please…"" My voice stretches into a thin whine. I can't stop shaking.

""Please,"" I say again, and I can feel the tears stream down my face.

It doesn't respond. It just stares and steps out of the crack.

When I hardly texted back, he told me he had imagined this to be different and he could take a no, if I wasn't interested. Thankful for the opportunity I told him, someone new doesn't fit into my life atm. Instead of taking the hint he escalated this further, I told him I wasn't interested in him, he told me to block him in that case, which I did.

What about ""I am not interested, I am not going to answer to your inquiries about my relationship status and I don't want to continue this conversation"" followed by me blocking him, is in any way open for interpretation?

1n6n4ho,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1n6n4ho/am_i_being_thrown_in_the_fire/,Am I being thrown in the fire?,"I applied to work as a barista at a local store (I could not be more unemployed right now and am trying to find jobs that will allow me to subsidize other regular habits of mine) and got called pretty quickly for an interview. It went super well, me and the store manager were vibing - she’s exactly the kind of leader I like to work under. She told me she would reach out soon when she has my next interview scheduled.

Then crickets. I soon found out she was on vacation for the week and would get back to me after x date - no sweat. Around that date, I reach out to touch base, and more crickets. I assumed I was being ghosted, but made my peace with it.

Today she called me back! She asks me if I’m still interested (I’m still poor, so yes) and then tells me to reapply for the shift supervisor position at the same store because she came back to work and has no people. She seemed overwhelmed on the phone and shared some personal information that leads me to believe she’s borderline desperate for reliable help.

I’m flattered (?) by her confidence in me, and I’m up for the challenge, but I’ve never been a barista before let alone the shift supervisor for a bunch of baristas. That coupled with the fact that she says she has no people makes me nervous that I’m being set to fail. 

TLDR: Is it normal to just go right into a shift supervisor position with no prior coffee shop experience?

I didn't know it was a ""black comedy"" going in so the ridiculousness of some the situations caught me off guard and got an audible laugh from me lol.

Not a horror movie in the classic sense. Nothing supernatural or any jump scares to be aware of. The director pretty much set out to show that freak accidents are just as powerful at making you squirm. 

One of the more uncomfortable movies to sit through as well (in a good way) which I think is due in part to the comedy angle. The dialogue really just hammers away at making you feel for our poor guy Jesus. While that might turn some folks off, I feel it really works for the movie and what it set out to do. 

Nothing groundbreaking here but it is well-acted, well-shot, horror-comedy that is a fun use of 90 minutes.

So my question is: how do I approach this conversation with my manager in a professional and respectful way, without sounding ungrateful or pushy?

There was a movie I saw before - either in the 90s or early 2000s - a scene where a girl works in a coffee shop or some sort of restaurant or something. She is playing some slower, sweet song sung by a man (I think it was one of those country/pop romantic songs popular back then - Bob Carlisle style) while she cleaned up shop for the night. I think she might have been putting chairs on top of the tables etc. I don't remember. Anyway, she was barefoot in the scene and sort of dancing gently to the music. If I remember right, the main love interest character was watching from a distance, admiring. For some reason I think he was up on a hill. Can you help me find what movie this scene was in?

I thought it was Julia Stiles in ""10 Things I Hate About You"" - I was expecting the scene to appear but it never did. So now it's bugging me... must be something else - If not Julia Stiles - Drew Barrymore, Leelee Sobieski, Rachel Leigh Cook? Ugh. The song is also on the tip of my tongue... I remember it was a  sweet slow song - each line of the verse was separated by 8 counts of no singing.

I wanted to put this post out here for community awareness.

We first hired Karnage to replace some historic windows. They were great and why we chose them again for a much larger job. We hired Karnage to replace our porch floor boards and fix some rotting elements. This was supposed to be a 1 week job that they started in April. They came out a week later than they said they would, ripped up the floor boards, tore out the railings, and then let us know that the joists are rotting and we need to replace the joists. They left it in a super unsafe conditon with a large drop off and no railings, putting any delivery folks or visitors at risk. After alerting them of this huge safety issue, they came back a couple days later, rigging up a temporary solution to make it safe-ish. We quickly provided the additional deposit for the joists work and they came back and replaced just the joists and left. Then the porch sat for weeks with no floor boards or railings and the porch roof on jacks. At one point they delivered the floor boards, but they were the completely wrong color and brand. The City then issued a stop work order because the joists are considered structural work and Karnage didn't file a permit or inform us that this was necessary. It's now been 4.5 MONTHS of our porch sitting on jacks, the interior columns open to the elements to further rot. They have submitted drawings 4 times and been denied by the City permit office. The City reviews and responses in less than a week and the it will be weeks before Karnage addresses comments. The correct floor boards have still not been delivered. Most emails go a week+ without a response. Calls are rarely answered. It's hard to feel like I'm not being totally scammed.

I get texts weekly from neighbors and other contractors about what's going on. It's embarrassing and frustrating but they hold our deposit.

Karnage has not offered any resolution, just excuse after excuse, pointing at the City, the weather, allergies(?), being out of town, the permit portal down, their email system not getting emails. These excuses are even posted to their instagram. It is so incredibly unprofessional. 

Meanwhile, Karnage is simultaneously opening a coffee/bookstore business while this all is happening and the 1 star Google reviews are piling up. I want to emphasize that this is a recent occurrence and you can see that in the reviews. I'm so frustrated and disappointed. We were excited to support a local, queer, non-binary business.

So y'all, do not make the same mistake that we did. Go with another contractor. They clearly bit off more than they can chew.",17,1756827758.0,rva,5,0.95,False

1n6mybm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n6mybm,"Our Gamescom journey: what worked, what didn’t, and what we learned","Hey everyone,

We just recovered from Gamescom and thought it might be useful to share what went well, what didn’t, and what we learned along the way. We had the chance to show \*Holy Shoot\*, our fast-paced roguelite FPS, to a massive crowd of players, and it was a great experience.

**The Good Stuff**

* The booth was constantly busy. We had players from all over the world jumping in, laughing, and sharing reactions. Watching them play live was priceless.
* Kids really loved it! We had a similar experience back at Game Con Canada (even though kids in Busan (BIC) didn’t seem that much interested). They queued up, gave high-fives, and kept coming back.
* Meeting other devs was a total highlight. The indie community vibe is alive and well, and sharing stories over sore feet and bad coffee kept us sane.
* Press and content creators stopped by, and we’re now in touch with some publishers as well!

**The Tough Parts**

* We only brought two laptops. Big mistake. There was always a line, and some people walked away rather than wait.
* Our MeetToMatch calendar was really full. Even though we were two people splitting responsibilities, it was exhausting to juggle back-to-back meetings and still run the booth.
* Running the booth itself is exhausting. Long hours, constant demo resets, and trying to stay energetic for each new player takes its toll.

**Player Feedback**

We filled an entire notebook with feedback. A few big themes came up again and again:

* **Weapons**: Full-auto guns felt flashy but sometimes cluttered the screen, some weapons (like the flamethrower) were seen as underpowered, and others (like high-rarity miniguns) were too strong.
* **Skills & Combos**: Certain element pairings could basically break the game. Fun for players, but definitely needs tuning.
* **Levels & Enemies**: Later areas felt a bit like endless wave clears. Players suggested fewer but tougher enemies with modifiers to make fights more interesting.
* **Options & Settings**: Players really want basics like an FOV slider, better sensitivity/audio controls, and clearer weapon info (tags or scopes).
* **Movement**: Sliding came up a lot as something people would love to see added.

**Takeaways**

For us, Gamescom wasn’t about wishlists so much as live feedback, networking, and opening publisher conversations. Still, for those curious, here are our numbers during the event:

|Date|Wishlists|Sales|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Aug 20|\+166|14|
|Aug 21|\+162|14|
|Aug 22|\+117|9|
|Aug 23|\+85|13|
|Aug 24|\+79|8|

These numbers were kinda expected. We had a similar experience at Game Con Canada, at BIC and at MIX.

But if you want to test your game at scale, watch hundreds of players interact with it in real time, connect with industry folks, and even start discussions with potential publishers, it’s worth it.

We headed home tired but motivated, with pages of feedback and a long to-do list. Would love to hear how other devs found it this year. Did you have similar experiences?

Thanks for reading, and if you’re curious about **Holy Shoot**, we’ll drop a link in the comments.

PS: Shoutout to Home of Indies! They took care of everything for us, from setting up the booth to dealing with USK ratings, so we could just focus on showing Holy Shoot. Absolute legends.

1n6msg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1n6msg2/ive_conquered_my_debilitating_social_anxiety/,Ive conquered my debilitating social anxiety,"A few years back I was diagnosed with social anxiety. I was terrified of being seen by anyone, i could barley keep it together while i was driving. I ended up failing a few courses one semester in college because I couldnt leave my car once I parked for class, I was petrified. I had no friends, could hardly function, and was uberly suicidal (was hospitalized multiple times).

Fast foward a few years later, I dont even meet criteria. I graduated and am now completing a graduate program, in social work LOL. I can walk into class on time or even late and not feel like a lion is about to attack because everyone is looking at me. Not only can i go to class, but I have become a main contributor to the conversations. I excel in my professional and academic life.

Just now, I really had a moment of reflection which led me to write this. I went through a drivethru to get coffee, which i once could never do, and they ended up getting my order wrong. Past me would have not said anything and would be disappointed and upset. This time, I went around the drivethru again (i had my cat in the car i couldnt leave her), and asked them to please remake the coffee. Now, there was even more confusion at the register when she asked me to pay the difference (i paid $8 for a drink and received a $6 drink). Instead of paying and wasting my money for the “convenience” of the other person, I spoke up and explained the confusion. All was good and I left. 

If I went through this a few years ago I would of had a panic attack after leaving the drivethru and this would have ruined my day. I would have thought I was such a burden and that the coffee ppl were gonna talk shit about me all day long. 
Ive finally reached a point where I can function like the average person, and not think im about to pass out and die from embarrassment.

For everyone out there struggling with social anxiety.. it can get better, you just need to keep exposing yourself to your fears.💗",4,1756827341.0,socialanxiety,1,1.0,False

I don’t know if I can take it anymore.. Is it time for me to leave? (Long post)","Hello everyone. Prewarning that this is going to be a long post but a lot has went on in our relationship and I could really use some advice. I know that usually it’s just as simple as leave.. but if you have any experience that is similar, I’d love to know how it ended up and I want to give all of our background because the last time I tried to get advice, I was told that it seemed like it wasn’t the full story so here’s the full story. 

Here’s the background : my partner and I have known each other since we were in fourth grade, him in 5th at first he was friends with my sister, my sister made other friends and eventually we started hanging out, we became best friends and we both came from a really bad environment. My home life wasn’t good, I started self harming, I was being abused by my stepdad, and my mom stood by it never saying or doing anything my older sister, however, was considered “the golden child” A+ student, athlete, could never do wrong. We had such opposite upbringing and I’m not sure why even to this day as an adult. My partners mom wasn’t in the picture, and his dad was living his own life by 13. My partner was living in an apartment that his dad paid for and would drop by to drop off groceries maybe once or twice a week. We bonded through trauma. When I ran away from home, it was to his place. And in seventh grade, I started dating his friend, even though I knew I had feelings for him. A year later, my family and I moved to another province. We talked occasionally, but eventually lost touch.

I found out that through those years he had been addicted to meth, heroine, coke, crack, alcohol, basically anything he could get his hands on. We reconnected when he lived in my city at 15 but at that time, my parents had divorced. My mom got addicted to drugs and started abusing me as well I had been living at our cities youth homeless shelter since I was 14. We plan to meet up, but it just never happened and again our relationship just disappeared. 

At 22 we ran into each other in the same city at our train station, it sounds so cheesy, but I noticed this handsome stranger looking at me, something about him felt so familiar he came up to me and said I’m sorry if this is weird, but is your name ___ I said yeah and he said you don’t remember me? And it all just came flashing back. He was much taller now, put on a little bit of a belly, had a full beard and the hat that was always worn backwards with what was called wings back then, was now a neat buzz cut. He asked for my phone number and I gave it to him. He sent me his first name while I stood right in front of him and then my train was there. He gave me a hug and I just remember he smelled so good, he felt so warm and my heart fluttered.. He said I’ll text you and gave me a smile. And sure enough he did. We caught up and both of us had kids from previous relationships, I one son, him one daughter we both had week on week off custody. 

We went on our first date shortly after , we went to an arcade, had a few drinks, laughs and played some games, I later found out that he had sold one of his old phones and watches in order to pay for the date.. when I think about that it just makes me wanna sob. Eventually, we started spending a lot more time together at 3 months he told me he loved me and asked me to be his girlfriend, at first, I said no. I had a lot going on and trauma from a previous relationship, when he asked me again at six months, I said, yes and at seven months and we introduced our children to each other, at about a year we started sleeping at each other‘s houses. At 14 months we moved in together, now I know that sounds really fast and if I could’ve done another way, I would have unfortunately my house flooded, at the time I was living in a two bedroom bi-level apartment and what started as a small drip from the ceiling caved in my roof and I had no choice but to leave with very little notice. At the time, my partner was also about to move and we decided to get a bigger unit together.

Three months after living with each other was the first time I found out he had been cheating. It tore me apart inside. I had a feeling for weeks that something was off. He was spending a lot of time by himself in our basement, he was drinking a lot, we weren’t being intimate anymore, and so I did what I should not have done and I went through his phone.. I found out that he had been talking to one of his friends, she had been sending him photos and sexting him. I felt my heart break inside my chest. He woke up the next morning and I told him that I was done. That was the first time that he told me he had an addiction to porn. We had a conversation and he told me even though I saw him drinking, he had been sneaking out to drink at night, his alcohol addiction was back, he said since we moved in together things had been really difficult.. obviously I have to mention that about three weeks after we moved in together he lost his job, he got laid off as they were overstaffed for their current season, he said that since we moved in together, I seemed miserable which again was not wrong. Even though I had previous relationships, I never saw myself living with someone. It was always just me and my son I have OCD and borderline personality disorder. I like things to be a certain way and living and sharing a life with someone was a really big hard change for me. He asked me if I would try to go to therapy with him and I said yes. I’m not sure why, but I forgave him. 

We only ever ended up going to one intro session, one week after that he had a cancer scare. He had a tumour growing on the side of his head throughout his ear, a month later, we did find out that it was benign and after that, I asked one of my friends to give him a job, they gave him a chance doing construction work, but it was long days 12 to 14 hours decent money, but still I had been paying the bills all by myself for almost 5 months. Unfortunately, about a month ago, his grandfather passed away, and he really started to go off the rails. At that point, my son was in BC with his grandfather for the summer, and his daughter was spending a month with her mom because she had a new baby. 

But I was absolutely miserable. Not having our kids around to focus on made me focus on the fact that I was in a relationship with someone that I didn’t trust, someone who wasn’t contributing to cleaning the house or paying the bills, someone that didn’t seem to want any in intimacy with me, and again he started going out a lot more and drinking a lot more, there were nights that he wasn’t coming home till 1 AM because he was “hanging out with the neighbours” and last night was the final straw. He came home extremely drunk. It was 1:30 in the morning when one of our friends/neighbors walked into my bedroom and said I need your help. I came downstairs to find my partner passed out on the floor. The neighbour and I lifted him onto the couch. The neighbour told me that he was sorry and he gave me his phone and keys. And so phone in my hand, staring at my drunk partner at that point, I already felt done, but the final mail in the coffin was going through the phone again  I sat down and opened his phone and went through it and for the most part there wasn’t a lot to find, I saw a lot of porn, something that I really did not like was I saw some videos he had saved of himself having sex with previous partners, but they were saved a long time ago. I just never noticed them when I went through his phone the first time. And again something that was saved before our relationship even started I didn’t know if I could be mad about that, but then I found the fetish websites. Fetlife to be exact.. the most recent message was from 14 days ago when about 20 days ago, I broke down to him and told him that since the cheating I feel ugly, I feel worthless, I compare myself to every woman I see because of what he did I constantly feel on edge or like I can’t trust him, I feel like every time we have a positive moment it’s overshadowed by the pain he’s caused me and something and may just snapped. 

The next morning he woke up and he said that he was sorry , he said that he was going to get help for his alcohol problem. He woke up and felt like he wanted to kill himself, he said he had been feeling suicidal for a long time, he said he had been feeling that way since his grandfather passed, it was like losing his dad. He said that I was the only light in his life aside from his daughter and he couldn’t wait for our kids to be home. I said if I’m a light in your life then why do you keep cheating on me? He paused and said what do you mean and I pulled his phone out of my pocket. He said why do you have my phone and I said when you came in last night, neighbour gave me the phone because you were so drunk, you tried to throw your phone when it died. And he said well there’s nothing in my phone, so why did you go through it and I asked him what is fetlife? he went red in the face and said he didn’t know what I was talking about. And I told him I took photos on my own phone so don’t play stupid right now.. he just went quiet. 

I took a deep breath, looked at him in the eyes and said you’re a fucking loser and I’m done.. a tear roll down his face and he said what do you mean? I said “ exactly what I said, you have a woman at home who loves you, who stayed the first time that you did something wrong, this woman being me raises your daughter when she is here, because when you’re not working, you’re out doing some stupid ass shit with the neighbours. I’m the one raising her on top of raising my own child, I’m paying all the bills and I can’t even remember the last time you contributed to that even though you have a job that’s paying you $34 an hour that I got you. When you’re home, you are not helpful, cooking cleaning taking care of the kids is all on me. When I am at work, I come home to an even bigger mess, kids upset because of the way that you parented them. If you can even call it parenting you put them in front of a TV and if they piss you off, they go to their rooms. You are a terrible parent, you are a terrible partner, and no matter what addiction you have, the fact that you can look yourself in the mirror and say I have a beautiful woman that takes care of me, a beautiful daughter and stepson, and I’m gonna ruin that all so I can look at some pussy.. you fucking disgust me. now, being that you clearly have been using all of your money for alcohol and not saving it all I’m gonna give you a month, my son gets back tomorrow for school, your daughter gets back in a few days, so I’m gonna give you a month to save your money and get the fuck out because I’m done giving you chances” the whole time he was just crying and trying to hug me. 

I said this is your last chance what do you have to say?  He said “I’m so sorry. When these chats happened, I was blacked out drunk and I barely even remember them but you said you went through my phone and there was nothing else to find. I haven’t been cheating on you or talking to anybody else yeah I went on these websites when I was drunk and I’m sorry there is something wrong with me. But I’ve hit my low point, I don’t wanna lose you, I’m gonna start going to therapy and AA” 
I cut him off and said I hope that works out for you but no matter what you do at this point nothing is gonna change. I’ve been begging you to go to therapy with me as a couple and you never had time but now that I’m telling you to get the fuck out you want to go? You can’t wait until everything falls apart to try to fix it. I’ve been the only one trying to fix this relationship for months and somehow I’m still the bad guy. I’ve been begging you for intimacy and instead of giving it to me you’re giving it to women online whether you were drunk or not. At this point, I don’t think that I could ever trust you again.

We went throughout the day, just ignoring each other. He kept trying to come to me and hug me and talk to me and I would tell him just leave me alone.. I went over to a neighbor’s house an older lady who’s like a mom we had some drinks and because I had not eaten and almost 24 hours the liquor hit me a lot faster I came home saw him on the couch and just went up to bed. I fell into the bed and just started crying. He came upstairs as I was hyperventilating. He got into the bed with me and put me in a bear hug, he was saying “”feel my chest, moving up and down, feel my arms around you, what is something that you can hear? What are two things you can see” and kept going until I calmed down. When I finally did, he looked at me and said I’m so sorry. I looked back at him and said I don’t understand why you did this to me, but I fucking hate you. I pulled myself away from him and laid at the end of the bed, he sat there completely still, and I just continued to sob until I fell asleep. He woke me up this morning, saying that he was going to work. He put his hand on my face, kissed me on the forehead and said I love you and I’ll see you after work. I just turned over and went back to bed.  When I woke up, he had texted me and said I made a therapy session for after work today.. I’d also like to attend an AA meeting if that’s OK with you. 

I haven’t responded.. he always does this. He pushes me to my breaking point and then says he’s gonna get help. Thank God that at the breaking points, the kids have never been around when they are home. We push our shit to the side and we deal with it on the week that they’re gone. I’m just in so much pain.. I love him. I always saw stories of people cheating, and staying and thought how stupid they were, and why don’t they just leave but now here I am in this exact situation and I’m devastated, I would rather him get the help he needs and stay with him.. maybe that makes me weak or stupid all I know is that I’ve loved him since I was 10 years old and I never imagined it going this way.. I downloaded my old Tinder account I saw a handsome man, with a good job who had sent me a “super like” with a message saying how beautiful I was and he’d love to take me for coffee and no matter how much I looked at it and how handsome he was I could not bring myself to swipe and immediately deleted the app. And that to me it was even more devastating. I knew how much he hurt me. How much hurt and anger I felt towards my partner and I couldn’t do it. So how when he was claiming to love me could he do that to me? 

I just don’t know what to do.. I’m scared to going back to a single parent, during this school year, I have full custody and I fought my ass off for it but that will mean that I find an apartment again and go back to doing it by myself on top of my day job and night job that I will probably have to quit. I will have to say goodbye to the daughter that I’ve raised and that I love so much. I will have to let go of the future that I wanted with this man since I was a child myself. This hurt so bad and I don’t know what to do. Both of us are not in a position to get a new place right off the bat. With my partner’s grandfather gone, he has nowhere to go and I myself don’t have any family.. so no matter what we are gonna have to stay with each other until we can both get our own place but I’m scared that I’m gonna let him back in and I’m also scared to be without him till it goes, the future that I wanted, and the man that I loved. But the man standing in front of me is not the guy that I wanted a future with he’s not the man that I loved he is an absolute stranger.. I just don’t know what to do.

**Picks (3/4)** 

\-CHI White Sox v MIN Twins Over 9.5 (+100) ✅

\-CHI Cubs ML (-120) ✅

\-ATL Braves v CHI Cubs Over 7.5 (-110) ✅

\-BAL Orioles v SD Padres Over 7.5 (-110) ❌

The part that *really* kills me is that the Orioles and the Padres put 4 runs on the board early! 8 runs was looking inevitable until the 8th inning. Finishing 1 shy = pain 😂 But alas, today’s a new day.

The last year has flown by… I blinked last September and arrived here. It’s been hard, I’ve worked late, showed up early, and made sure to approach every assignment with alacrity and a desire to learn as much as possible… but I have not been able to shake the feeling that I just don’t like this work. I never envisioned doing this type of work, (personal injury insurance defense), the opportunity was one of many that I applied for toward the end of law school, and one of the few that presented viable options. I’ve been stressed that I’m just not cut out for this. 

However, today, something is different. I got into the office on time, not at all excited about drudging through another day of dense files and confusing, Get-Outlook-for-IOS signed emails from senior partners with vague assignments and even more ambiguous due dates. 

But I sat down, as I’ve done every day for the last year, intent on doing a job. My secretary had placed the recently filed opposition to my MSJ on my desk, I grabbed a cup of coffee, put on some easy listening tunes, and started reading. A little while later, I had a status conference with the senior partner to discuss strategy for our reply and was green lit for every counter argument I thought we should make. I’ve got a draft working, sent some emails on some other cases, and made plans with the wife to bring her favorite lunch home and see my beautiful 2 month old daughter for a minute… before returning to this desk covered in papers and sticky notes and several legal pads. Normally, I’d feel trapped and stressed and like I have no idea what I’m doing.

But for some reason, instead of feeling dread or apathy about this work… I’m excited. This feels like life. Maybe I’m just reeling from a nice long weekend with my baby. Maybe I can smell that wonderful Fall air around the corner, and the thoughts of spending the holidays with my wonderful wife and our precious babygirl are clouding my judgment. But I think I can get used to this. Stockholm syndrome or do I actually like litigation now? Probably best not to dwell on it. Happy Not-Monday everyone!",24,1756826428.0,Lawyertalk,11,0.93,False

Work and studies have taken me across five countries, and while I love exploring, I’m now ready to build a cozy home —with the right person.

I’d love to meet someone in their 30s or 40s who’s who’s established in their own life and also ready for a life partner, a forever connection

I’m a deeply feeling introvert who spends a lot of time on health, fitness (yes, I’m a bit of a fanatic and proud of being in great shape), nutrition, and spirituality-lately learning more about Advaita. I throw myself into the things I care about, whether that’s work, friendships, or simply living everyday life with intention. I’m equally comfortable debating world affairs, swapping travel stories, or laughing over something completely silly.

I also know that two people coming together to build a life isn’t easy. What makes it work, I believe, are respect, trust, and a lasting friendship to carry you through the tougher parts.

Who I imagine you to be:

* You laugh easily, say funny things, and love when I do the same.
* You are my BFF and do not roll your eyes when I use the term BFF.
* You are damn smart – but not a snob about it. You are in love with life. Family comes first. 
* You do not mistake my warmth, love, and affection for weakness.
* You do what you love. You make the best of any situation.
* You share your chips with me. You will come with me for walks. 
* You love hard, fight fair, and balance modern independence with a touch of old-school kindness.
* Compassion and generosity guide your choices, and you always try to see the best in people.

Simply put, you inspire me and are inspired by me. That’s the kind of bond I’m looking for—one that’s deep and supportive, but also light-hearted and adventurous.

**So what say - shall we travel, smash patriarchy, cook healthy, work out often, make memories, and open our hearts and minds?**

**If this resonates with you-win me over with free-flowing conversations, deep enough to matter and spark thought, playful enough to see the humor in things.

1n6mdmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tariffs/comments/1n6mdmg/orange_juice/,orange juice,"I was puzzled why Trump didn't impose the full tariff on orange juice. 

Here is what copilot said. 

U.S. orange juice producers, especially major importers like Johanna Foods, opposed the 50% tariff on Brazilian orange juice because it would drastically raise costs and hurt consumers. Brazil supplies over 75% of America’s orange juice, and domestic production—especially in Florida—has declined due to disease and weather damage. U.S. producers rely on Brazil’s not-from-concentrate juice, which has no viable substitute in quality or quantity. Johanna Foods estimated the tariff would cost them $68 million annually, forcing a 20–25% price hike at retailers like Walmart and Aldi. The industry warned of layoffs, supply chain disruptions, and legal violations, arguing the tariff lacked proper authority. Their lobbying emphasized that the move would turn orange juice into a luxury item for many families, while failing to achieve meaningful trade leverage. Ultimately, economic self-interest and consumer impact drove their resistance.

  
Given this, why were the coffee roasters unsuccessful in opposing the tariffs. was it because the orange juice producers are in a red state?",0,1756826408.0,Tariffs,3,0.5,False

My problem is: whatever grind setting I tried my V60 just tastes off. There’s astringency and weird dry mouthfeel everytime. I tried 4 different coffee beans, problem persists. Same beans taste ok from the Wilfa, or at least the way I expect them to.

I calibrated the grinder to the zero point. I also aligned the burrs and it seems I did a decent job as far as I can tell. The grind results shown in the photos (settings 1, 6 and 11 in that order)

After multiple disappointments i started wondering where the problem originates.
1. I struggle with dialing in the coffee (wrong coarseness).
2. My palette is sh*t and I just like what I got used to, so I prefer Wilfa.
3. There’s something wrong with the new grinder.

My wife and I and our LO (M 17 months) have been living with her parents since he was born. I love my in-laws and they've been a huge help. We're actively looking to move out to be closer to my job as it's higher income and more demanding. 

We started daycare 2 months ago, 3 days a week. Mom and Grandma watch him for the other 2, prior to that when my wife went back to work it was mostly Grandma with us helping on the days we work from home.

Grandma introduced TV and now he's addicted. Anytime he's bored or tired he points to the TV and cries. We've let it go on to give Grandma a break but it's gotten worse.

Look Grandma is great, but anytime my wife or I are actively parenting LO she swoops on and takes over. I'm feeding him she comes on starts chopping up stuff, adding butter, suggesting he eat this and that. Playing with him outside, she comes rearranges things, asking about hat, sunscreen, etc, things we've already taken care of because you know we try to be good parents. She buys him toys even after we've said we need to slow down and reduce the toys. Anytime he cries, yawns, or moves, and I'm around, she swoops in.

This morning things have come to a head in a very silly way. We've all been sick this weekend with a daycare bug. He's up at 5 and so am I, cooking him breakfast and sit down to feed him. She wakes up comes in and starts cutting up his sausage which I'm not feeding him yet because it's too hot. I sit down and say ""I've got it"" in what I thought was a completely neutral way. Seems fine, she makes herself a tea, we have a great breakfast.

I have to use the bathroom (thanks coffee) and hand him off to Mom who is still in bed. I come back and they are all in the living room about to put on the TV (It's 7am!) and say hey no I'm going to take him on a walk I'm really trying to break him of the TV habit. Grandma loses it, calling me  disrespectful, saying this is her house, saying I'm rude and critical. I'm totally caught off guard. She then goes on to say as I'm leaving, that she's just trying to help. I say I understand but her swooping in and taking control all the time makes me feel like she doesn't trust me with my own child. She says, almost crying, I will back off all the way, I don't need this kind of criticism, your tone is wrong when you say you've got it and you're mean. Really Dads, I try SO HARD to never be cross and to gently assert when I've truly got control of the situation.

Some of me thinks this is left over trama. My brother-in-law and his ex-wife used to also live with them and were VERY strict with their LO. Don't want to go into it but the ex-wife definitely had PPA and was changing her kids diet all the time in unhealthy was. I think my mother-in-law blames herself for their breakup and the ex-wife eventually suicide (which I don't believe at all).

Dads, how do I deal with this?
I love my mother-in-law and want to reconcile the situation we also do depend on her help 2 days out of the week. But I want to be able to set boundaries and feel respected when parenting my LO.

Anybody else had to deal with something like this?

I (24F) was diagnosed with narcolepsy about 6 months ago after struggling to get a diagnosis for years and years. Yesterday, I was walking around a very large mall with some friends in a city that I am unfamiliar with. After walking around for an hour I started to feel dizzy, lightheaded, nauseated and honestly very scared and anxious. I thought I was going to have a severe panic attack or faint/collapse in the middle of the mall, and unfortunately, I wasn’t getting much support from the group I was with. I went up to a random coffee stand for ice water and tried sitting at a table in the middle of the mall while everyone went in a store. The only time I felt any relief was when I closed my eyes and put my head down, but I felt extremely uncomfortable and unsafe in that location. Then I remembered… I have narcolepsy! I was experiencing the most severe sleep attack I’ve ever had in public. I finally garnered up the courage and followed the advice I’ve received from many other users on this app— and I am so proud of myself! I walked into the store and approached one of the workers, informing him I was with a group of people at the front of the store and that I had a medical condition called narcolepsy and that I was about to fall asleep. I asked if I could just lay my head down on the couch in the back room for a few minutes until I felt better, and to my surprise he offered me an entire fitting room to take a nap! He made sure the door was shut and I was able to curl up in a ball under the bench and slept for about 5 minutes. I woke up feeling so much better and was able to stay awake until I was in a safe, private location for a real nap. I was honestly so relieved with how kind and generous the employee was, and I am so thankful that I can finally understand my condition better and how I can manage it. After my nap the store employee told me that he had just learned what narcolepsy was about a month ago from a YouTube channel— and he even knew how to help by offering me a safer, private place to sleep which gives me hope for the future of narcolepsy awareness!! Please don’t be afraid to ask for help when you need it!! Stay strong and don’t ever feel ashamed for being yourself <3",6,1756825609.0,NarcoBaddies,0,1.0,False

1n6lyxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1n6lyxa/does_blackdecker_12cup_coffee_maker_offer_value/,Does BLACK+DECKER 12-Cup Coffee Maker Offer Value? Comprehensive Review Inside!,"Using the BLACK+DECKER CM0915BKD 12-Cup Coffee Maker as my daily coffee companion has been an intriguing experience. Described as a simple yet functional drip coffee machine, this appliance combines key features like Vortex Technology and a Sneak-A-Cup option, aiming to appeal to coffee drinkers who prioritize efficiency without compromising taste. I've tested it extensively, brewing everything from weekday quick fixes to leisurely weekend pots, which has revealed both its strengths and limitations. Let me walk you through how this coffee maker measures up in different aspects.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
The overall design of this coffee maker is functional and straightforward. It sports a sleek black finish with metallic accents, fitting well into most modern kitchens. Its compact dimensions, at 11""D x 8.2""W x 12.2""H, allow it to nestle comfortably on a crowded countertop without being obtrusive. The removable filter basket is a lifesaver for cleanup; it’s dishwasher-safe and compatible with standard basket-style paper filters. A no-drip spout on the carafe ensures you won’t be cleaning up coffee spills during mid-pour. That said, the unit’s lightweight build (3.66 pounds) does leave it feeling slightly less premium and sturdy than pricier models.

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
This coffee maker’s performance centers heavily on its Vortex Technology, designed to saturate coffee grounds evenly. I noticed a balanced extraction in most of my test runs, resulting in well-rounded flavor profiles. The 12-cup brewing capacity is ideal for large households or even small office settings—I’ve brewed for guests and colleagues without needing multiple cycles. The Sneak-A-Cup feature is a bonus if you’re too impatient to brew a full pot. It halts the brewing process temporarily, letting you pour a cup without creating a mess. However, I found it slightly finicky; timing is crucial to ensure no dripping occurs.

**Ease of Use**  
Using the coffee maker is a breeze. A single On/Off switch simplifies the process, making it suitable for users who prefer an old-school, no-nonsense approach. The lack of complex buttons or programming options might deter tech-savvy individuals hoping for more advanced features like adjustable brew strength or timed brewing. For me, keeping it simple worked great on days when I wasn’t looking to tinker with settings. If you need a coffee maker to “just work” reliably, this unit delivers.  

[Check BLACK+DECKER CM0915BKD price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0c8b9v7hr/)  

**Advantages**  
- Vortex Technology ensures better flavor extraction.  
- Sneak-A-Cup feature allows convenient mid-brew access.  
- Dishwasher-safe removable filter basket simplifies cleanup.  
- Compact and space-saving design accommodates tight spaces.  

**Bad Points**  
- Lacks programmable features like an auto-start timer.  
- Lightweight build feels less robust compared to competitors.  
- Sneak-A-Cup feature demands precise timing to avoid spills.  

**Competing Products**  
In comparing this coffee maker to other options on the market, it fared surprisingly well given its price point. Against the Cuisinart DCC-1200, a notable competitor, the BLACK+DECKER offers a simpler, more stripped-down experience but lacks customizable brew strength or a built-in timer. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew presents more versatility by accommodating both K-cups and ground coffee, but it doesn’t saturate grounds as effectively as this model’s Vortex Technology does. If straightforward drip brewing with rich flavor extraction is your focus, this machine holds up admirably.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering the features and functionality, this coffee maker delivers solid value. Budget-conscious coffee enthusiasts who prioritize essential performance over all the bells and whistles will find it well-suited to their needs. Its combination of flavor-focused brewing technology and an accessible price point makes it an option worth considering, particularly for first-time buyers or those looking to replace aging appliances.

Yang walks in to see Ruby sitting on the couch with a look of existential dread plastered across her face. Next to her sits Penny, trying to console her, for all the not good it's doing.

""So ahhh, what's going on here?""

Penny looks up and greets her with her usual radiant smile. ""I'm attempting to comfort Ruby. She's... concerned about her future prospects in the upcoming Death Battle.""

Ruby continues to sit there, rocking back and forth while hugging her knees. ""Everyone keeps saying Maka's gonna kill me. Like EVERYONE, EVEN MY FANS!!!""

""Just relax sis,"" Yang replied flippantly. ""It's not like it will be the first time.""

""There's a difference between dying and getting killed and you know it!"" Ruby grumbled in anger. ""It's was my choice last time... not that anyone really tried to stop me. But still, MY CHOICE!""

""Will you calm down."" Weiss had been partying to her break down and decided things were getting tedious. ""It's not that bad. I died in my Death Battle and you didn't see me freaking out about it.""

""Right? I wasn't worried about my Death Battle. Who knows how it will go?"" Yang chucked, flopping back on the couch and kicking her feet up on the coffee table.

Ruby looked up and growled at the pair. ""It's bullshit! You won because our new season was coming up and they put you up against a best girl. Weiss lost because she IS BEST GIRL, she loses every fight she's in by default. 

""That was... hurtful..."" Sniffed Weiss.

""They put me against Tifa, one of the most poplar girls in media!"" Yang shot back.

The redheaded huntress leaned forward.  ""Exactly. Poplar girl with a track record of losing.""

""I don't have a track record of losing Ruby."" Pouted Weiss. ""And how many fights count as a loosing streak.""

""Ask the fans, they'll let you know.""

""OK smarty, how many did Tifa lose?

""She lost of Yang, which the creators said they got wrong. Best girl curse I guess.""

""OK, I guess but...""

""She lost to Hitomi, our creator handed her that one.""

""Yea... sure but...""

""She lost to Loz in the movie.""

Weiss settled back and closed her eyes. ""While your point is taken, i don't appreciate being a part of it.""

Its fluorescent tubes hummed overhead with the unmodulated patience of insects as their chalky glow fell across cubicles stamped from a single template. The air was filtered and re-filtered until nothing remained but the faint metallic tang of toner, like a machine sweating in silence. The floor beneath had long given up any claims to individuality, its carpet tiles stretched in a gray grid, scarred here and there where chair wheels had chewed the pile to its base. Nothing suggested personality or invited permanence; this was a space built for the unremarkable circulation of forms and figures, leaving behind only the quiet trace of stapled bundles sliding into cardboard boxes.

I found the sameness soothing. To some, it was suffocation; to me, it was order. Each desk was a repetition of the last, each cabinet an interchangeable twin. No unexpected textures, no unpredictable arrangements. Just uniform surfaces and the quiet expectation of work.

Carrie had stationed herself at the far end, nearest the dark windows, though the blinds were drawn so tightly they denied even the outline of the city. She bent forward in her chair as if refusing any concession to comfort, her hands moving briskly across the papers before her. Her coffee sat untouched, a pale ring already forming at the bottom of the paper cup.

Lee occupied the opposite side, his chair tilted back at an angle that flirted with imbalance. He worked with a kind of ease that disguised its speed, punctuating the silence with a tuneless humming that had no audience.

Carrie spoke without lifting her eyes from the page. “We’ll be here until dawn if we don’t keep up.” Her voice carried no urgency, only the flat certainty of someone who had already decided what reality would be. She marked another box with her red pen.

Lee swiveled lazily in his chair, one hand spinning the stapler as though it were a toy. “And what would dawn look like, exactly? Same cubicles, same coffee. Just warmer light.” He snapped the stapler once in the air, then set it down with a thud. “Face it, Carrie, it’s all one long day, just chopped into pieces to keep us from noticing.”

She allowed herself a short laugh, the kind that sounds like clearing a throat. “That’s poetic, Sisyphus, coming from the guy who’s been here what, three months? Long enough to start complaining, anyway.”

Their words fell into the white hum of the room, dissolving almost instantly, as though the air itself absorbed conversation the way it absorbed scent and color. Only the rhythms remained: Carrie’s pen scratching quick diagonals, Lee’s stapler clicking at odd intervals, my own steady shuffling of papers from one stack to another.

I let their voices wash past me. Here, neutrality was my armor; it kept me invisible, efficient. I processed another claim, checked a figure, initialed a box. The motions required nothing of me but accuracy, and that was what I gave.

The claims moved across my desk in predictable sequence, each one a variation on the same narrow theme. I opened the folder, noted the policy number, confirmed the date, compared the figure against the table. My pen traveled the grid with the steadiness of a metronome. Tick, tick, tick. A form lifted, a box checked, a file slid to the finished pile. Then again. And again.

I didn’t mind the repetition; in fact, it stilled me. The boundaries were clear. Nothing unexpected would appear in these columns, no surprises waiting in the margins. Each page was another iteration of the same formula, and in that, I felt secure.

It almost had the cadence of a ceremony, though no one here would have named it that. The fluorescent hum became the chant, the scrape of chairs the shifting of pews. Even the paper carried its own incense, dry and acrid, a faint perfume of pulp. I felt myself settle into it the way one settles into prayer, the body learning the motions until the mind no longer needed to guide them.

Carrie’s pace was sharper, more aggressive. Each mark of her red pen was a verdict, a slash of finality. Her stack diminished with visible satisfaction.

Lee’s rhythm was looser, more syncopated. He lingered over certain lines, scribbled a note in the margin that had no purpose but to amuse himself, and punctuated each file’s completion with the click of his stapler like a cymbal crash in an invisible score.

Outside, unseen, the city was opening its arms to the encroaching night. Inside, we processed claims, three small figures lost inside the mechanical ritual of a late shift.

“Clock says we’re behind,” Carrie murmured, tapping the corner of her wristwatch with the same irritation she reserved for misfiled forms. “At this rate, we’ll be here until sunrise.”

I kept my head down. Answers were unnecessary here. The office rewarded output, not input.

For a moment I thought we might finish the night without further interruption, then the printer stirred in its alcove. It had been silent for hours, its green standby light the only proof of life. The mechanism roused itself like a body uncurling from sleep. The sound was sudden, almost violent in contrast to the hush we had grown used to. We all looked up at once.

Carrie’s pen frozen mid-line. Lee tilted his chair back and cocked an eyebrow.

“Someone printing something?”

We both shook our heads.

A single page emerged into the tray in slow increments, each advance accompanied by another grind of gears until eventually falling silent again.

Lee was the first to reach over. He plucked the page from the tray, turned it upright, and frowned. “Well, this isn’t in the training manual.” He laid it flat on the desk between us.

The sheet was filled with thin, unbroken lines that climbed like spindly towers, some wavering in jagged steps, others curling into small, deliberate hooks. Along their lengths, tiny circles and strokes were perched with odd regularity. No two columns were identical; they rose in uneven ranks, peaks and valleys forming the outline of something like an Alpine peak. Off to the side, a darker swirl unfurled like a signature, incongruous yet somehow integral. The longer I stared, the less it resembled anything familiar, but there was a certain aesthetic order here that tugged at the eye.

Carrie glanced once, shook her head, and pushed it aside.

“Somebody probably printed to the wrong floor.”

Lee frowned. “Or someone’s using company property to print out their art project.”

She ignored him, already back to her red pen and her stack.

Lee tapped the page with his stapler. “Could be a test sheet. You know, when IT’s trying to check alignment or toner levels.”

Carrie didn’t even look up. “It’s just garbage. Put it back by the printer. If the owner wants to pick it up they can drop by in the morning.”

Lee slid the sheet toward me as though passing contraband in class. “What do you think?”

The weird orderliness of the shapes held me. The Ionger I looked, the more repetitions I began to see: a curve here mirrored by another three inches below, a sequence of parallel lines returning at uneven intervals. If it was noise, it was strangely consistent.

I shrugged, letting the gesture serve as an answer. My best effort would only end in speculation.

We returned to our work. Carrie’s pen began its clipped diagonals again, Lee resumed his syncopated stapling, and the steady shuffle of paper filled the silence as though nothing had happened. The sheet lay by the printer, face up, forgotten by them but not by me.

My eyes strayed to it each time I set a claim aside. At first I told myself it was only curiosity, an itch that would fade. But the feeling sharpened instead. Certain shapes recurred when I looked: a cluster of curved lines like parentheses nesting inside one another; a sequence of angled strokes forming a rhythm almost musical. My hand moved over the insurance forms automatically, yet my attention orbited the abandoned page.

There were no words or letters, or indeed any markings that were immediately recognisable to me. But neither was it random. The ink seemed laid with intention, like a pattern I had only glimpsed at the wrong scale.

I initialed another claim, slid it to the finished pile. Outwardly I was still part of the rhythm, still one of three. Inwardly, though, I was already following the lines elsewhere, to a place I could not yet name.

The second time the printer woke up, there was no pause between noises. Gears caught, rollers pulled, and the printer’s tray received the paper fed steadily into its throat. One page slid out, then another, then another – an uninterrupted stream that showed no sign of stopping.

Carrie exhaled, long and thin, without lifting her head. Her pen continued moving, though her shoulders tensed.

Lee leaned back, swiveling his chair to face the machine. “Somebody’s printing their dissertation. Or maybe a bedtime story for us. Forty pages of once-upon-a-time.”

The printer’s rhythm was patient. Each page landed in the tray with a faint whisper, the stack rising higher and higher.

I stopped working, though my pen was still in my hand. The first sheet had been an anomaly, easy to dismiss. But the persistence of this, page after page in unbroken procession, felt almost insistent, as though something on the other side of the line had decided it would not be ignored a second time.

The pages kept coming. Fifteen. Twenty. Twenty-five. The stack began to lean under its own weight.

No one moved to stop it. We only listened, waiting for the machine to finish its slow delivery.

By the time the printer sighed itself back into silence, the tray sagged under a thick sheaf of forty or fifty pages. Lee rose and lifted the stack with both hands, raising his brows at the weight of it. He flipped the top sheet toward us and gave a low whistle.

“Not insurance claims,” he said. “Unless we’re covering Area 51 now.”

The page teemed with markings, a saturation of strokes that seemed less drawn than extruded. Lines climbed in vertical ranks, breaking into hooked branches and curling in minute detours. The formations resembled circuitry, though their scale refused to resolve. Sometimes it was like the ridges of an organism’s vascular system, sometimes like the layout of towers glimpsed from orbit.

A cluster to the side coiled into a spiral, dense as a fingerprint. The next sheet offered no clarification: more columns, each annotated with tiny circles and bars, as if enumerating positions along an axis whose units were unknown. By the third page I recognized the futility of analogies. It was not text, not mathematics, not blueprint, and yet it carried the weight of all three. The intent of a message was palpable. It only lacked a translator.

Carrie didn’t bother to look. She waved a hand toward the printer. “Leave them there. Whoever queued that job will come searching.”

“And if IT is building a death ray?” Lee suggested. He sounded almost sincere. “Will you pretend you didn’t know when the rest of us are turned to dust?”

I gathered the papers before he could drop them back on the tray. “I’ll keep them aside,” I said. “No sense in them cluttering up the place.”

Lee shrugged and returned to his chair. Carrie had already returned to her red pen.

I placed the stack on my desk. It loomed at the edge of my vision, an unfinished sentence waiting to be read. I told myself I would only glance through them between claims, the way one skims a magazine while waiting in line. But the moment I spread the stack across my desk, the insurance forms shrank into background noise.

The first diagram was an engine, or almost an engine: cylindrical, chambered, with radial fins that suggested cooling vanes. Yet the dimensions contradicted themselves. Proportions warped as though drawn in two perspectives at once. No machine could be assembled from such a blueprint, though it carried all the conviction of something that might.

The second sheet resembled a turbine, its blades curling inward like petals, overlapping with incredible density. I traced one arc with my finger and realized it returned on itself in a loop akin to something like a Möbius strip.

Further pages carried what I assumed to be notations. The bars, circles and intersecting diagonals looked mathematical and were arranged in regular but complex sequences.

One sheet gave me pause. It showed a structure of hexagonal compartments, radiating outward in spirals whose geometry produced a faint illusion of rotation. Some cells were shaded, others left blank, the pattern suggesting a code rather than ornament. I searched for analogies in honeycombs, lattices, antenna arrays, but each comparison dissolved on contact. It was not tissue, not machine, not mineral.

From across the aisle Lee said, “Looks like you’re trying to unwrap the Voynich Manuscript.”

I didn’t answer.

Carrie spared a glance, then shook her head. “Don’t encourage him. We have real work to do.”

But the real work seemed pale now in comparison. These pages hummed with a different order, one I hadn’t been able to grasp yet. My pen hovered over a claim, unmoving. The diagrams tugged at me, pulling thought into their lines as if the ink itself had weight.

We drifted back toward our tasks, though the room had changed. It was as if the diagrams had thickened the air, made the fluorescents harsher, the shadows beneath the desks deeper. Even the copier’s hum seemed pitched a half-tone lower, a background drone that pressed on the skin.

I slid the stack a few inches closer, not openly, but enough that my elbow brushed the top sheet whenever I reached for the next claim. The presence of the pages steadied and unsettled me at once. They were not blueprints, not diagrams. Not in the ordinary sense.

From the corner of my eye I caught Carrie watching. “Don’t get lost in it,” she said, half a warning, half fatigue. “We’re already behind.”

Lee stapled another file but kept silent.

My hand flattened over the stack, pressing the sheets together, as though to hold them still. The lines bled faintly through the paper, hints of arcs and intersections that joined from one page to the next.

I initialed a form, placed it on the finished pile, and told myself I was still within the rhythm. But my gaze returned again and again to the stack.

The hours bent in on themselves. At some point the clock’s hands passed midnight, though none of us marked the moment. The office air grew stale, heavy with recycled breath and the sour edge of coffee. Carrie rubbed her eyes with the heel of her palm, then forced another stack into line.

“We’ll be back here in a few hours anyway,” she muttered, though whether it was complaint or simple observation I couldn’t tell.

Lee let his chair drift into a lazy spin, one foot dragging a half-circle on the carpet. “If I had known we were going to have a sleepover I would’ve brought pajamas.” His usual chipper expression looked thinner now, the late hour pulling at the edges.

Our efficiency faltered. Carrie’s pen strokes slowed. Lee stapled a page twice in error and cursed softly.

It was then, with the air so heavy, that a single page from the stack seemed to resonate on a previously untapped frequency and I had the vague sensation of being on the cusp of something familiar.

I found it halfway down the pile. It differed from the others only in its restraint. It depicted no machinery, no spiraling arrays, no dense knots of symbols. Just curving lines, thin and deliberate, covering the sheet in rings and ridges. At first I mistook them for fingerprints, whorls magnified to impossible scale. But then I saw the breaks, the depressions, and contours. It looked intricately like a map.

The familiarity of it prickled at me. I had seen those shapes before, not in an atlas, not in a report, but somewhere that clung stubbornly at the edge of memory. My pen stilled above the claim I had been filling. Slowly, I slid the page onto the clear desk space beside my keyboard.

With a few keystrokes I pulled up an online lunar chart. Mare Imbrium, Mare Serenitatis, Oceanus Procellarum – the great basins, named centuries ago, stared back from the screen. My heart gave a small, involuntary jolt. The contours matched perfectly, line for line.

Lee leaned over, following my gaze. “Wait. Is that… the moon?” His laugh was uneasy, more exhale than mirth.

Even Carrie looked up this time. She came over, arms crossed, peering down at the diagram with narrowed eyes. Acknowledgement softened her features for just a moment before the mask of brisk indifference returned.

Still, she didn’t walk away.

Lee leaned closer, squinting as though the lines might rearrange if he stared hard enough. “So that’s it, then: this is top secret material accidentally routed to Accounts?” He tapped the page with a fingertip, then shook his head. “NASA is building condos up there for the moon people.”

Carrie gave him a look sharp enough to cut paper, but she didn’t step back. “If you want moon people, at least use the proper name.”

That caught both of us.

“Proper name?” I asked.

She shifted, almost embarrassed. “Selenites. From *The First Men in the Moon*. Wells.”

Lee blinked, then grinned. “You read things other than balance and checking accounts?”

Carrie crossed her arms tighter, defensive. “What? A girl can’t have a hobby?”

It was strange to hear her invoke literature, stranger still to hear warmth in her voice. For weeks she’d spoken only in clipped directives, half-measure encouragements, managerial reminders. Yet here she was, conjuring creatures from Edwardian fiction as though the reference had been waiting under her tongue all along.

Lee chuckled. “You’re full of surprises.”

She sniffed, but I caught the trace of a smile before she turned her eyes back to the page.

The three of us stood there in silence, bent over the lunar contours like pilgrims deciphering a relic. The files on our desks waited, the clock ticked toward another lost hour, yet none of us moved away. The pages spread across the tabletop, their diagrams overlapping in places, arcs and lattices repeating like motifs in a song. Lee traced a finger along one curved line until it intersected with another. “If you squint, it almost looks like trajectories.”

Carrie rolled her eyes but didn’t argue. Her usual dismissals seemed harder to summon now, the certainty in her voice eroded by fatigue and the uncanny neatness of the diagrams. She muttered something about “too much nonsense” and gathered her coffee cup as though preparing to leave.

Lee, amused more than unnerved, leaned back in his chair. “Still, if there is a secret lunar base up there, I hope they’ve got good benefits. Dental. Maybe shorter hours.”

The laugh he gave was thin, almost hollow.

My eyes ran again over the pages, searching for patterns that might link one drawing to the next. There were suggestions that felt too deliberate to ignore. Each page whispered a fragment, and taken together they seemed on the edge of speech.

At last Carrie exhaled, a thin breath that carried the weight of weariness. She gathered the loose pages nearest her, tapped them into a neat stack, and set them aside as though tidying would give her a sense of finality. “That’s enough for one night,” she said. I didn’t know whether she was referring to the claims or the printouts until she reached for her coat.

Lee lingered a little longer, then he rose, stretching, his chair groaning in protest. “Guess that’s our cue,” he murmured, and began packing his things with care. “You coming?”

I shook my head. “I’ll catch up in a bit. The last train left half an hour ago anyway.”

“Don’t stay too long,” Carrie said, slipping her bag onto her shoulder. “Call a cab when you’re done.”

Their departure was unceremonious and a deep and immediate silence settled in their wake. The sound of their footsteps faded down the corridor until even that measure of human presence dissolved. The diagrams spread before me pulled at me like magnets.

Alone, I could finally begin to arrange them.

I gathered my finished files into a neat pile and pushed them aside. Without the others watching, my hands went directly to the pages, already restless to spread them out, to see them all at once instead of in fragments.

The office felt different without witnesses. It was not emptier, exactly. It was heavier.

I stood, the stack in my arms, and crossed to the larger conference table. Space enough to see the whole picture – if a picture was there.

I spread the pages carefully, one after another, until the conference table was papered in black and white. At first the diagrams clashed with one another. Engines crowded beside lattices, spirals clambered across grids as though they belonged to separate languages. But I noticed small details, repeated motifs, the way certain arcs bled just over the edge of one sheet and reappeared on the margin of another.

I slid two pages together. The curves met seamlessly, the inked lines crossing into one another with too much precision to be accident. A third page locked into place, extending the pattern outward. The stack began to resolve itself, not as scattered noise but as fragments of a whole.

My claims work had trained me to notice consistencies, to trace repeated digits and dates across forms, to catch the slippages where patterns broke. Now that same habit guided my hands. Slowly, I built outward from a central knot, arranging the sheets in rows, then columns, correcting, realigning.

The diagram grew. Lines that had seemed meaningless in isolation bent into coherent arcs, like roads traced across a map. Some terminated in clusters of dense machinery, the cross-sections from earlier pages now snapping into context, no longer separate inventions but parts of the same system.

I stepped back to take in what I had assembled. The table glared under the fluorescents, every sheet a tile in a mosaic. For a moment it looked abstract, beautiful even, a geometry so precise it seemed to breathe. Then my eyes found the shape it was forming, and the beauty curdled into recognition.

Two circles. One large, one small. The smaller hung above the larger, tethered by arcs.

Very clearly, it was the moon staring down at Earth.

At first, it was easier to see only circles and arcs, clean geometry without consequence. But the longer I stared, the more detail insisted on being noticed. The smaller circle was pocked with craters – those same whorled fingerprint shapes I had decoded as lunar craters earlier. The larger circle was divided into faint segments, longitude and latitude implied by the sweep of lines. Earth and moon, not merely suggested but rendered in ink and paper and strangely beautiful mosaic.

And the arcs… There were so many. Dozens of them, each drawn with care, each beginning on the lunar surface and curving downward, crossing space to terminate on the earth’s globe. Their curvature was precise, mathematical, as though calculated trajectories.

I leaned closer, following one line with my finger. It terminated in a dense knot of machinery, the kind I had puzzled over earlier. Chambered cylinders, turbines that bent space, arrays of hexagonal cells. When seen alone, they had been baffling. Set in place now, I felt like I was looking at a satellite image of a weapons cache from an old spy movie.

The repetition confirmed it. Every arc linked to one single nexus located at the geometric center of Aristarchus. A network of launchers above, a scatter of targets below.

My throat felt dry. I pressed my palms flat against the table, as if bracing myself against a sudden tilt in the floor.

I told myself it could not be real. That it was an art project like Lee had joked, an experiment, some designer’s thought game misplaced into our printer’s queue. Yet the precision worked against that dismissal. These weren’t doodles. They were plans, drafted with intent, scaled with care.

I looked up, as though the ceiling might peel away and reveal the source. The fluorescents buzzed steadily, and yet the whole room felt complicit, as if it had been waiting for me to see.

I sat back, the chair groaning beneath me, and forced a laugh that sounded foreign in the empty room. It was absurd. Missile trajectories from the moon? Pages smuggled into an insurance office in the middle of the city? The very thought had the flavor of a late-night conspiracy forum. Got your tinfoil hats on? Let’s go.

And yet, the lines refused to collapse into nonsense. I tried to blur them with my eyes, to imagine them as abstract art, a collage of architectural scribbling. But each time the arcs reasserted themselves, elegant and precise, falling earthward with a weight that could not be imaginary.

I rose, began gathering the pages into a stack. My hands shook slightly. I wanted them hidden, bound together, not spread out accusingly across the table.

That was when the printer stirred again.

The sound came sharp and sudden, a mechanical cough that startled me into stillness. I turned, half expecting another cascade of diagrams, but the printer’s tray received only a single sheet. It slid forward in careful increments, the rollers releasing it as though reluctant to let it go.

I crossed the room slowly. The page looked blank at first, until I lifted it closer. Across the center ran neat rows of ones and zeroes, perfectly aligned, unbroken. No diagrams, no spirals, no craters – just binary, printed with a steadiness that felt colder than the machinery itself.

For a moment I only stared. Then habit guided me back to my desk. I opened a browser, typed in the first online translator I could find, and fed the sequence into its waiting field.

The answer appeared in plain English:

APOLOGY. WAVELENGTH IS ERROR. PREVIOUS NOT TO YOU.

The words hung there, ridiculous and intrusive in equal measure. Something not meant for us, spilling into our queue like a letter dropped through the wrong slot.

I read the message again and again, as though repetition might soften its implication. Instead, it deepened the unease.

I left the office with the folded page in my bag, though it felt less carried than smuggled. The door clicked shut behind me. My footsteps echoed against linoleum, louder than they should have been, as though I were walking in an empty museum after closing.

The elevator doors opened, their metal panels reflecting my shape in warped fragments. I stepped inside and pressed the button for the ground floor. The descent was slow, the hum of the cables rattling through the shaft. I tried not to think about the page inches from my hand.

The lobby was deserted. Security had already gone home. Outside, the city pressed close: lamps flickering over wet pavement, distant traffic a muffled hiss. I crossed the plaza with my collar up, feeling the sharpness of the air in my lungs.

It occurred to me that the world was unchanged, indifferent.

At home I placed the page on my desk, smoothing it flat with the edge of my hand. The radiator ticked now and then, the hum of the refrigerator was steady in the kitchen.

I told myself I would leave the page on the table until morning. Sleep first, clarity after. But the idea of lying in bed with the words still waiting, unexamined, became impossible. I opened my laptop, the screen washing the room in cold light, and typed the string of ones and zeros into the converter again.

The same result appeared, blunt and undeniable: APOLOGY. WAVELENGTH IS ERROR. PREVIOUS NOT TO YOU.

I refreshed the page and tried again, spacing the digits differently, wondering if the line breaks mattered. The answer was unchanged.

I tried to imagine the sender, something on the far side of the link, realizing it had reached the wrong receiver. The Selenite, like Carrie had said. Did it fumble, embarrassed? Did it recoil, severing the connection?

The clock read 3:17.

If the message was real, if the diagrams were what I had taken them to be, then surely someone must have imagined this before. I typed the title Carrie had mentioned, *The First Men in the Moon* and found a full text on a public domain lit website and scrolled to the final few chapters.

The transmissions from the scientist Cavor did not end so much as thin, tapering into silence. At first they came in bursts, detailing his astonishment at the Selenites’ architecture, their structured habitats, the delicate mechanism of a society balanced on logic. Then, gradually, the tone shifted. He spoke less of wonders, more of questions. The Selenites pressed him about Earth, about its peoples and their nature. And Cavor, unable to resist, had told them. He described wars, armies, conquest; he confessed that humanity spread wherever it could, devouring, reshaping, never satisfied with boundary or treaty.

The Selenites listened. They weighed his words. And then there were fewer transmissions. Fragments arrived, halting, his voice thinner, troubled. In his last messages he admitted to fear – that his candor had been an error, that he had armed them with knowledge. He tried to explain, to soften, but the words broke apart in static, each fragment shorter than the last.

Finally, there was nothing. The line went dead. The hives below the lunar surface closed themselves to him, or perhaps consumed him, and Earth heard no more. All that remained was the silence between the worlds, the abrupt severing of a voice too far away to call back.

I thought of our printer, humming in its corner, disgorging pages as though no one had asked it to speak. First the patterns, then the diagrams, then the trajectories. And finally, the binary message: apology, error, not meant for our eyes.

It was impossible not to draw the line between Wells and the printouts.

I closed the text and sat very still, the glow of the laptop screen fading into its screen-saver haze. My reflection looked back at me in fractured fragments: eyes pale, mouth drawn tight. The binary page lay at my elbow. I could recite its message by memory.

I thought of the “man in the moon,” that childish pareidolia of ridges forming a face and a smile. And yet after tonight I cannot look upward without seeing differently. The dark basins are no longer seas, the craters no longer accidents of cosmic parking. They are silos, launch ports, eyes turned earthward.

If the diagrams were real, then the moon was not barren, not a relic of rock and dust as science declared. It was armed. Outfitted. Prepared. Those elegant arcs had not been abstractions; they had been launch trajectories, plotted with an engineer’s precision. Cross-sections that had seemed impossible were weapons, or the engines of weapons. The hive structures were not ornament but storage, housing something lethal in geometric nests.

A pre-emptive strike before the world ever got wind of their existence.

For a society so keenly infected by logic, this was the most logical course of action.

History, viewed from the necessary distance, resembles less a record of progress than a catalogue of expansions. One territory after another, absorbed, its resources transmuted into the energy of conquest. The justifications vary from divine mandate, civilizing mission to economic inevitability, but the mechanism remains constant: to treat every new horizon as unclaimed, every foreign system as incomplete until bent into our own. Colonization was not an aberration of history, but its operating principle.

The horror is not in the cruelty itself, which is familiar enough, but in its predictability. A pattern so deeply woven into the human program that it continues even when the scale becomes absurd: armies pitched against climates, against oceans, against extraterrestrial bodies themselves. To announce ourselves to another intelligence is already to threaten it, for what we call curiosity is indistinguishable from reconnaissance, and what we call exchange is indistinguishable from extraction. No species that has observed our history could conclude otherwise.

Perhaps that was why the silence mattered more than the diagrams, more even than the trajectories. To be overheard was to be exposed.

The thought of that apology was therefore both absurd and unbearable: the universe, vast beyond measure, had brushed us by mistake, then pulled its hand back in embarrassment. Like writing a damning condemnation of someone and then sending it to their inbox by mistake.

What can I do? I am nobody. My life is measured in forms processed, claims filed, boxes checked. And yet, by accident, I have glimpsed something of cosmic proportion.

The scale of it mocks me. The radiator’s ticking sounds like a countdown, the refrigerator’s hum like static through a receiver. The city outside is moving in weary ignorance.

I can’t call the police and say the moon is armed. I can’t ring up NASA and demand they check their printers. I don’t have clearance, contacts, credibility.

But maybe one of you does. Maybe someone scrolling through this is military, or government, or whatever agency still checks this kind of stuff. I don’t care if it’s Washington, Moscow, or Beijing – Hell, even the Pitcairn Islands will do. If the printouts equate to what I think they do, if the arcs are what they look like, then nationality doesn’t matter.

So here it is, my warning. Maybe this is the only chance for someone to hear, someone with the power to act.

Because if the arcs fall where they’re meant to fall, it won’t matter what side of the line you’re on.

It won’t matter at all.",1,1756825210.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Some notes/tips:


* Pilgrim’s Haven is good if you want a peaceful area and a while apartment unit, but it’s a bit of a tuktuk ride from the town center.
* If you opt for convenience, book your accommodation within the city center to lessen your tuktuk rides.
* Always book the bus in advance through Coda Lines FB or terminal because seats run out quickly.
* Food in Sagada is a bit pricey compared to other places, but servings are generous and it’s worth trying out different cafés.
* Tuktuk is the main way to get around (₱50 per trip for 2).
* Bring a heat-tech top and a thick sweater. It's a must for Sagada's weather!

Survivor served to showcase how women CAN overtake men in physical challenges to a wide audience that sort of believed the opposite. It happens repeatedly on this show, and this since 2000, which we all know was a different time with a different perspective on this. Even in season 20, Boston Rob sort of ridicules his own win against Candice by snickering at camp about his victory ""Oh, woohoo, guys, wow, I beat a girl, how impressive...!""and Survivor has showcased some other instances that could be interpreted as sexist, but I think it ultimately stands as a cool symbol that showed time and time again that women can kick ass. The mixed-gender challenges questioned conventional gender narratives regarding physical superiority. I can't think of a show before this that put both sexes in the same physical challenges, and when you think of it, it was pretty ""before its time"". Sports were often segregated by gender, which we saw a lot more of in earlier Survivor seasons in Sumo wrestling challenges etc. But to see instances like Rupert bashing Jerri into a wall for a chocolate reward challenge etc. in a mixed gender challenge is so nuts when you look back at it? I recently watched s20 (HvV) and I'm pretty sure I recall some crazy mixed challenges in this season, for example Basket Brawl where Jerri (again!!!) gets wrestled by Colby in the water. This was so nuts to me as we typically were separated in school gym class by gender in the 00's-10's and it seemed eye opening to see women take on dudes and be this badass on TV.

Do other things come to mind for you about the show? Has it changed how you think? Many of us watch the show when we're young, too, so I feel like it can shape our way of thinking subtly.

For the past year, I’ve been a regular at a local coffee shop, visiting a few times a week to work. About six months ago, I noticed a man, around 35 years old, who started showing up every Tuesday and Thursday. He was always neatly dressed and had a friendly demeanor. We began with casual small talk about books and movies, which felt harmless. He was easy to talk to, and over a few weeks, our conversations became a regular part of my coffee shop visits.
During one chat, he mentioned he was married and had been with his wife for eight years. He described their marriage as distant, saying they felt more like roommates than partners. I listened but didn’t press for details, as I’m cautious about getting too close to married people. As a trans woman, I’ve learned to set boundaries, but his kindness made it easy to keep talking. After a couple of months, he suggested we grab food at a nearby diner to continue our conversation. I thought it was just a friendly gesture, so I agreed.We met at the diner a few times over the next month. He’d share how much he enjoyed our talks, saying I made him feel understood in a way he hadn’t felt in years. I was flattered but started feeling uneasy, knowing he was married. One evening, after our third diner meetup, he admitted he was developing feelings for me. He said he admired my confidence and how I brought a spark to his life. I told him I couldn’t be part of anything that crossed a line with his marriage. He said he didn’t want to hurt anyone, just that he felt a connection with me.
I decided we needed to stop meeting outside the coffee shop. It wasn’t easy because I enjoyed his company, but I knew it was the right choice. He respected my decision, and we haven’t met up since. I still see him at the coffee shop occasionally, but we only exchange polite nods and keep our distance.
TL;DR: I’m a 21-year-old trans woman who formed a friendship with a 35-year-old married man at a coffee shop. After a few months, he admitted feelings for me, but I ended our meetups to respect his eight-year marriage. We now only nod at each other in passing.",16,1756825080.0,cheating_stories,0,0.94,False

Just a guy who misses and looking for a girl that is fine with a casual intimacy. A girl who misses being touch, getting dominated, and getting babied in bed. A someone fine with being casual and not ready to commit in relationship. 

A someone that is not too aggressive, just a normal or soft girl that wants to be submissive. A girl that is open for giving blowjobs and hanjobs.

I'm open for inexperienced girls that wants to try getting eaten, fingers, or getting a dick inside you.

It could be a one time thing or a long term casual intimacy. Pero it's much nicer if it's long term.

My husband and I both work full-time, with two little kids in daycare/school, a dog, and a mortgage. Money management has never been my strength, but I’m trying to get better.

We also come from different money backgrounds—he grew up with four kids and very little money, while my family was frugal but more flexible with spending. Add in daycare costs and busy schedules, and it feels like a tough season.

I’ve tried Mint, Simplifi (not a fan), and YNAB (too much upkeep). Is this just a stage where money feels tight no matter what, or have you found tools/strategies that really help? Can you suggest a tool that might give me a good picture that has less of a learning curve than YNAB but a better handle on big picture?

Edited to add: 

Ok, I think, with taxes and healthcare, we take home around 100k, mortgage is about $2k, daycare is about $2k, groceries are about $1k. Right now, cc is around $20k (don't hate, two kids in daycare got expensive last year), but, like I said, we have some money coming towards the end of the year that will pay that off. That leaves us around $3k for other stuff - money for gas/fixing the car, buying kids clothing/supplies, vet bills, pet care expenses, eating out, gifts for people's birthdays, supplies for school, paying off debt, etc. 

My husband and I, together, make six figures - we're middle of what's considered the middle class. We live in a metropolitan area in the midwest, our cars are paid off, but we bought our house in 2020 at the peak low interest rate and far below the normal housing price. We have a bit of credit card debt because of the the previous daycare situation (two kids in daycare is now one in daycare and the other in public school) but the debt will be paid off come Christmas, although it's not a situation I would like to rely on. We just had a birthday party for one kiddo and we have a block party coming up, we try as much as humanly possible to cook food at home and I'm trying to limit my spending on stuff I don't need/coffee/take out. Hopefully this helps.

I set the grinder (df64 gen2 with SSP HU) on a finer setting upto 5 (I grind at 10 for espresso) it did some choking but managed to make the grounds flow with few taps to the bellow.

Used 7 grams of coffee with 1:10 ratio at 60 celsius, stirred roughly 10-15 times and set it on the hob with copper Turkish coffee pot upto boil.

Couldn't believe my tastebuds that I had no idea what flavors those beans could have.

I normally grind twice the size for espresso as I've mentioned, 20grams, using ims h23.5 big bang basket, 94 celsius, 50grams out (1:2.5) in 30-35s, 2-7s pre-infusion, without any sourness our bitterness.

However, I just found out that the flavors were dull af.

How can improve the extraction and get those Turkish coffee flavors? Grinding finer will most probably choke the espresso machine but would that help?

This particular farm, during the late 19th century and early 20th century, had about 70% of its workers coming from Italy. 
I've started noticing that on the bookkeeping Italians had, for a few decades, their names written like SURNAME FIRST NAME, somits common to see ROSSI MARIO, BIANCHI PAOLO, etc. However, other nationalities and Brazilians had their name written in the common way:  FIRST NAME SURNAME. 
Even at the church records here (the farm has its own church) Italian names always appear like this; so we have records like this: 
""... The infant PEDRO was baptized, son of DENADAI PAOLO and MARIA DO VASCONCELOS..."" 
Or:
""... The wedding of ANTONIO BUARQUE DE OLIVEIRA and the Italian ZANFELICE ANGELA ...""

I have researched but never found anything talking about this. 
The other day this video appeared on my timeline and it was recorded in Rome in the 1950's. I've left just the beginning because the boy in the video introduces himself just like this, saying his SURNAME and then his NAME.

1n6ln93,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1n6ln93/castaneda_part_5/,Castaneda (Part 5),"My uncle’s house waited at the end of a gravel driveway, drowning in a sea of blackberry brambles. The paint, once some indeterminate shade of grey or blue, was peeling away in ragged strips. The windows were cracked and dirty, streaked with years of rain and pollen. It looked like a carcass left to rot in the elements. The bowed and warped wooden porch creaked underneath my feet as I retrieved the key from under the welcome mat. The lock turned with an unpracticed resistance and then I was inside.

Faint traces of life permeated the space: pairs of shoes lined up by the front door, a chipped coffee mug resting on the kitchen counter, a half-knotted scarf draped over a worn armchair. It felt like he had simply stepped out and never returned. Although we were never really that close, it pained me to look around at this. He was someone I barely knew and now wouldn’t ever know. It felt strange to lose a family member who had never truly been mine to lose.

Mom never got along with her brother. He was the older of the two and had a real stubborn, bull-headed nature about him. They’d had a falling out over inheritance money when my grandfather passed. My uncle insisted he deserved more, pointing to some obscure family logic only he seemed to understand. It was always hard to bridge that gap afterwards, especially after he moved away from Medford.

I navigated through the living room and adjacent hallway towards his bedroom. The door opened with a reluctant creak. The curtains were drawn with dust stirring in the soft light. The bed was made and there were clear vacuum lines in the carpet. In the far corner, an old roll top desk sat tucked against the wall underneath a crooked painting of Mount Hood. The cover had been left halfway open, revealing a sprawl of papers underneath.

I stepped closer.

The top page was that of one of the symbols I had seen on the floppy disk. It was crudely drawn, with the pen pressed so hard into the page, it’s surprising it didn’t poke through the other side. I leafed through the pile to see more of the symbols arranged in different orientations. Halfway down, a folded sheet slipped free:

*“Possibly Ooikima in origin. Translation is unknown. I theorize that the dream-talkers used them for their rituals.”*

My eyes wandered over the cluttered desk and landed on a framed photograph tucked in the corner. It was him, younger, smiling in a canoe on Lake Diana. It struck me how little I actually knew about him.

To the right of the pile was a topographical map of Castaneda and the surrounding hills. A yellow highlighter circled where I had been the night before: Tatonga Cave. I felt like there was no way this could be a coincidence. There was a purpose to these notes I didn’t understand. I folded up the map and note and haphazardly stuffed them into my breast pocket.

I went back into the living room and sat on the recliner to take a moment. The chair’s stuffing shifted unevenly, leaving me tilted slightly to one side. The fabric was threadbare in places and was rubbed smooth by years of use. I thought about him sitting here, in this same chair, in this same quiet.

The last time I had been in Castaneda was fifteen years ago. I was a teenager then, roughly around thirteen years old. My mom sent me here to stay with him while she had to fly off to a business trip in Madison, Wisconsin.

That week was long. He was a man of very few words. Most of the time I saw him with a bottle within reach. He never seemed drunk exactly, just dulled, as if he were always half-removed from whatever was happening. But now I wonder how much of that was him and how much of it was only what I chose to notice. I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to grieve for him or if I was even allowed to. To call him family feels almost technical.

I stood from the chair and continued to search the house. I moved through each room slowly, opening drawers, closets, and boxes. The more I searched, the more ordinary it all became. Nothing that suggested the disk, the symbols, or the cave. Just the remnants of a solitary life, intact but unremarkable.

The car was waiting where I had left it. The engine turned over in a rough start and steadied into a low idle. The road out was gravel that eventually transitioned into asphalt. A few other houses could be made out through the trees, yards scattered with the remains of things once used and then left to weather.

The houses grew farther apart, until they stopped altogether. Only trees now, leaning their branches overhead. The pavement narrowed and the paint lines were worn to faint traces. My speed crept higher without me noticing.

Then the bend came suddenly.

A red Toyota Tacoma swung wide into my lane. The grill filled the windshield in an instant. I jerked the steering wheel hard and my tires bit into the shoulder of the road. The gravel rattled under me as I fought the wheel back to the lane. 

My heart was pounding from avoiding the near-collision. The red truck’s brake lights glowed dull in the pale daylight as it eased onto the shoulder. I followed, pulling in a short distance behind. The driver’s door opened. A woman stepped out, lean, her dark hair pressed under a frayed beanie and a cigarette tucked behind her ear. She didn’t look surprised.

“You alright?” she called across the gap.

I forced myself to nod. “Yeah. You?”

She gave a shrug. “Fine.” Her eyes flicked to my car, then to me. “Sorry, got a bit distracted fiddling with the radio. Wasn’t looking where I was going.”

“I’m good if you’re good.” I said.

She crossed the space between us in a few easy steps. She stopped just close enough that I could smell the faint tang of smoke clinging to her jacket. “Nice to meet you, *good.* I’m Blu.”

I gave a pity laugh. “I’m Jezebel, actually.”

“Jezebel, huh? I hope I didn’t scare you too much.” She eyed me up and down for a moment. “You’re not from around here, are you?”

“Nah, I’m just visiting.”

She smiled. “Well, let me be the one to formally introduce you to this shithole town. Where you headed?”

I wasn’t used to this small town hospitality and banter. It was hard not to feel guarded. “The Coronado.”

“Funny you mention that. I was headed there myself before almost running you into a ditch. Mind if we make it a *not-so-near-death* double date?”

I felt like I couldn’t say no, even though I had planned on hiking back to the cave. “Sure.”


_____________________________________________

Inside the Coronado ‘51, the light was dim, yellowed, and seeping down through the cracked plastic of overhead fixtures. The booths were upholstered in vinyl that had split in long seams, patched over with strips of silver tape that had begun to peel at the corners. Blu opted for a booth against the wall. She slid in with her back to the window, one arm draped lazily across the top of the seat.

Bonney, the waitress I had seen in here the night before, came over with her notepad. Her hair pinned up in a hasty knot. “Hey there, Blu. How’s your grandmother holding up?”

Blu gave a shrug. “She’s fine, I guess. You know how she is.”

She turned her gaze to me, as though she was trying to place where she had seen me before. “Hey, aren’t you the girl that was in here last night? I could’ve sworn I saw you climb up into the woods after walking out of here.”

“I think you’re mistaken,” I said. “Wasn’t me.”

I could tell that Bonney didn’t necessarily believe me by her facial expression. She tapped her pen against her notepad. “Alright, uh, I’ll give you two a minute to figure out what you’re ordering then.” She walked back towards the counter.

There was silence for a moment. Blu leaned forward and studied me. She idly rolled her unlit cigarette between her index finger and her thumb. “So what were you *really* doing last night?”

I kept still.

“It’s alright. I’m not trying to spook you. I’m just curious.”

I let out a sigh. There was no way she was gonna believe me, but I felt like I didn’t really have anyone to rant about this to. What’s the harm in spilling this to someone I had just met? “I came here for a funeral. My uncle’s. I went up there last night to help with the search and rescue, but I got a little turned around. Found this cave up there. I heard a strange noise and left immediately.”

Blu wasn’t smiling anymore. “Wow, that’s-“

“Wait, that’s not all. Mind you, I hadn’t seen my uncle in years. Hardly knew him, really. This is gonna sound crazy, but he left me something. A floppy disk. When I opened it, there were symbols on it. Strange ones.”

I leaned back into the booth seat.

“I started seeing things after that. A shimmering void. Some memories I had never experienced. *Futures that haven’t even happened yet.* Some sort of coyote creature with hands over its eyes.”

Blu stared at me, her lips parted like she’d forgotten the cigarette between her fingers. Her eyes darted to the window, like she expected something to be standing there, then back to me. *“I’ve seen it too.”*

1n6lmq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1n6lmq3/advice_on_solving_the_two_body_problem/,Advice on solving the two body problem,"**What is this?**
The *two-body problem* refers to academics with career-oriented partners (often also academics) trying to land jobs in the same location. It's a play on the *three-body problem*, which famously has no closed-form solution. This is my advice after going through the process twice.

**What this is not:**
This is not general faculty application advice. For that, I recommend the helpful posts of [Sylvia Herbert](https://sylviaherbert.com/faculty-application-advice) and [Kira Goldner](https://www.kiragoldner.com/blog/job-market.html), who have already covered everything and have been part of the inspiration for sharing my experience.

This is roughly organized in the chronological order of when you should care. Note, my experience is based in North America, and there may be regional differences.

---

# tl;dr

1. Don’t take things personally: (most) people would like to help, they are just **TBTC** – *Too Busy To Care*.
2. Be clear on what matters to you and your partner, and negotiate accordingly.
3. Stay positive and optimistic during negotiations.
4. You’ll be dealing with multiple people, not the university as a single entity. This means many different priorities, but also many opportunities for miscommunication and lots of bureaucracy.

**TBTC** (see above) is the root cause of almost all issues I’ve seen. Decisions that seem careless or even malicious usually stem from people being overloaded. I've found it helped to keep my sanity and stay positive to always remember that ""These people want to be happy, just like me. They really _would like_ to make things work out. They are just **TBTC**"".  

You can also use this to your advantage: **make their job easier**. Take the initiative to find out where you can plug departmental needs. Offer to do the leg-work communicating across departments: if the head of department says they need to ask the Director of Undergraduate Studies about the current teaching needs, offer ""Should I email them directly, with you in cc?"". If hiring you makes their life easier, it's more likely to happen.  

At one university, known for solving two-body problems well, the key difference I noticed is that they didn't rely on people doing a good job, they changed the system: a distinct service position called “work-life liaison” would handleddual hires — not a dean juggling a dozen other roles. In short: they ensured the person handling this was not **TBTC**.

---

I will keep the writing as objective as I can, and occasionally give a bit of backstory of my own experience when I thinkit can be helpful to give texture/nuance. Some overall context to my story...
> My partner got an exploding offer at University A (UA), with assurances I’d get a PI-level position: not tenure-track (TT), but with the same responsibilities/privileges. Over half a year later, I was finally offered what was essentially a postdoc under a professor who was not aligned with my research goals (though a nice person).
> In the meantime, I applied broadly, got faculty interviews, and a TT offer from University B (UB). We then negotiated with both universities. UB quickly interviewed my partner and made two TT offers. UA eventually matched its original promise. We compared our options (see point 2 above). Although the offer from UB was technically more (two TT positions instead of one), it did not match my partner's priorities for other reasons, whereas the offer from UA did match mine. We decided to stay with UA as the place we would find the most happiness.

---

# Typical setup

Usually, one of you gets an offer from Department A (the **primary**), and discloses the two-body issue. The department says ""we have a great track record at dual hires!"" and asks for the partner’s (the **secondary**) CV to forward to Department B (**host**) (assuming you and your partner are in different fields). I was surprised that they do not ask for more than just the CV (no research statement, etc.)... but they do want it immediately, so make sure that it is polished beforehand.  
Handling the secondary hire then usually escalates to someone senior (vice-dean, head of department, etc.) who negotiates with the provost and host department leadership.
A successful outcome is that a position for the secondary, with guaranteed funding for the first N years (I've heard of anywhere between 1 and 5) being provided by some combination of the provost (aka university-level pot of money), the primary's department, and the host department. While 1/3 each is common, I've also heard of things being as one-sided as {75%, 25%, 0%}.

Many places have a standard template offer they can offer easily (e.g., a 2-year funded postdoc for the partner), but anything else is handled ad hoc and requires time and negotiation.

---

# Application Phase

## Know what you want

Have a clear, honest conversation about your values and goals, first with yourself and then with your partner. This helps you make fast, good decisions under pressure. Note, even when the negotiations drag on for a long time, there are often only a few actual negotiation sessions (so, still making some decisions on the spot).

>In my case, there are two reasons to stay in academia: I find fulfilment in intellectual freedom and mentoring students. So once I had _in writing_ PI status for grant applications and could advise students, everything else was a bonus. My partner's priorities are different. This means we could compare two different sets of offers, and choose the one that would give us the most happiness as a team, rather than comparing them by their ""objective"" value. And while it took almost a year to get our final offer, the last round of negotiations happened over 2 weeks.

## Align your timelines

It helps a lot to go on the market at the same time (this was our first mistake). This means, for example, considering taking a postdoc or similar if your partner needs another year or two to graduate. If you do align, then:

1. You're both more mobile.
2. You double your chances by casting two nets.
3. Your partner having an offer (even somewhere else) gives you a lot more leverage. Leverage is key.

## Don't bring it up until you have a verbal offer

I initially planned to bring this up early: I wanted to maximize the number of dual offers, not the number of initial offers. Only one senior professor agreed with this reasoning; _everybody_ else told me not to bring it up until you have a verbal offer, including people at places I (or my partner) was interviewing at. I'm glad I heeded their advice.  
From the search committee's perspective, the worst thing that can happen is a failed search, so anything that will make the hire more complicated is something they are strongly incentivized to avoid. Once they've committed to a verbal offer, it is suddenly a lot of work to go back and convince everyone to agree to go with someone else, and so the incentive is now very much to make these negotiations work.

## Apply to overlapping institutions

If you both apply to the same university:

* Best case is you both get independent offers (I have seen this happen).
* Even if not, having both CVs in the system makes everything faster and easier. Remember, everyone is **TBTC**.

---

# Negotiation Phase

## Get it in writing
Whatever agreements you have _must_ be in writing to be relied on, for many reasons.

* You are not negotiating with a single entity, but several people representing different interests. There are many opportunities for miscommunication, or different interpretations, often with no ill intent but nonetheless with negativeoutcomes (for you).
* The various roles (dean, head of department, etc.) are rotating positions, and whoever made you assurances now may not be there in a year (or five) when you need them
* Most importantly, whoever made you a verbal promise will often be too busy to enforce it when the time comes. Having an official piece of paper means you don't have to involve someone who is **TBTC**.

## Stay positive

Even if you feel you're being mistreated, you need to stay positive!

First, this is just frankly the only way to stay happy in the position if you do get it. Especially if you feel you're being mistreated (I certainly did), this can be difficult.
> In my case, when meeting old friends, I would complain about what was happening; too much, my partner pointed out. My partner was right, and I started to make an effort to tell more positive stories. This has paid off.  

Second, one of the main concerns of the host department is ""what if we get stuck with a bad apple"". If, for any reason, there is concern that your presence in the department will cause friction, regardless of how unjustified, it is safer for the department to just say no.

> In my case, there was a professor I had briefly talked to about working with. We decided not to (they were looking for a postdoc, which I wasn't interested in being), and we left it at that. Everything fine, I thought. Later, once I was negotiating for my actual (independent) position in the same department, I found it difficult to make headway, and I couldn't figure out why. Luckily, a friend in the department gave me some clues, and I realized this professor felt I had been ungracious in not taking the position in their group. I reached out, we had a coffee and cleared the air, and everything was fine. From then on, that professor has been very positive, and I am still baffled why they had felt negative in the first place ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. The moral is, even though I don't feel that it was my fault that there was friction, it was still my responsibility to defuse the situation.

## Leverage matters

Leverage helps. The *prestige* of your competing offer especially matters.
Note that (assuming your alternative is still academia), the prestige of your alternative institution will matter, a _lot_ (I was quite surprised to learn just how much Americans care about rankings...)!
Again, this boils down to **TBTC**: the person you're dealing with directly might not care and value you, but they (typically) need to go to the _provost_ to ask for resources to make the counter-offer. Talk about too busy! This means they don't have time to look at your profile in-depth, but will rely significantly on cognitive shortcuts, most notably, the prestige of your leverage.


## It's not personal, it's strictly business
Don’t feel bad negotiating or exploring other options. The people you're dealing with have been through this several times, and they know the drill. Just keep it professional, don't lie or deceive, and no one will fault you (heck, they are likely to see it as a strength).

> In my case, I had suggested that my partner also reapply once I started applying, and my partner felt bad shopping around since they had already accepted the position at UA. Since then, we have seen several hiring calls where some, if not most, of the applicants were people who had just started a TT position elsewhere 1-3 years earlier (so, in similar positions).

also,

> In my case, once I went on the market, the expectation from the start was that the leverage from any offers would result in our staying at UA. I did, however, take all applications seriously, and we ended up almost moving to UB. All of the places I turned down, I was honest about why (we are solving a two-body problem), and they have always answeredkindly and also encouraged us to consider applying again if we are looking to make a move in the future. Curteous, professional, and no hard feelings.

But in the meantime, just go to work, do what you have to do and go HOME. Quit worrying about other partners and what they’re doing and worry about SELF. Ignore the gossip and cattiness and GO HOME. Follow these tips and your work life at starbucks will be less stressful.

1n6lkv6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n6lkv6,Splitgate 2 Sponsor System,"I had this idea around the time of the Splitgate Showdown event, inspired by an idea from a YouTube creator.

Essentially, it would be a progression system where players would pick a team (out of 3 available, each based off of a different faction like the Splitgate Showdown) that would be sponsored by different canon sponsors within the world of the game. One of these sponsors would be the “main” sponsor of the team, providing the majority of the rewards to players, with the other sponsors providing more minor rewards. Players can earn rewards as they play, and they can contribute to a main stat pool of some kind that dictates what team “wins” the season.

This would also provide an opportunity for the abilities of the different factions to be added in, most likely as arena powers. My idea was for the sponsors to be responsible for their addition, and they would rotate or be changed randomly every season as more are added (after the last playtest, this could be tweaked).

This last bit is objectively a bad idea, but I feel that it could work if done properly: to differentiate this from other, similar systems, and promote some competitiveness among players, minor sponsors could possibly switch around when a chapter ends. This would depend on which team was “winning”when the chapter concluded, similar to how real sponsors operate, changing who they back after their contracts end in order to preserve their own self-interests.

Does using a double spout affect brew time since there’s more room for your coffee to come down? Or should it still take 30ish seconds?

My last shot finally took a bit longer to pull than my hilariously short 10 second pulls I previously had, but it filled up a 100ml cup in 25 seconds. So I’m wondering if I need to make the grind more fine, or if I should actually just be stopping at around 15 seconds instead. Thanks!

From what I see, the general coffee business already feels pretty saturated. So, for someone starting out, would it make more sense to focus on specialty coffee or espresso blends?

I’m also wondering:

- What’s a reasonable starter budget for a roasting machine, and what type/capacity should a beginner aim for? (500gr,1kg, 3kg, etc.?)

- How do you calculate profit margins in roasting, and when can you realistically expect ROI?

- How do you know when it’s the right time to scale up your operation?

- With so many roasteries already out there, how can a beginner actually compete?

- How do you create demand and build a market from scratch when nobody knows your brand yet?

BUT SHE LITERALLY CANNOT AFFORD IT????

we were talking about the list of things she needs to buy and the total came out to like 240 dollars - and that's minus the vet and adoption fees. and while I support her and want her to be happy and with cat, i just feel like she shouldn't get one right now since she literally does not have the funds to consistently support this potential cat without the support of her parents - which isn't even guaranteed btw because they're against the idea of her getting a cat. Also, she's unemployed. no hate to the unemployed bc the job market is crazy hard to get into lately, but she expects there to magically be money when she needs it when that's not true at all.

ADDITIONALLY, her apartment doesn't even allow cats unless you pay extra for it and it's way out of her budget (i think she said like an initial 300 payment and then it's 100+ per month). Like that's crazy in itself imo but the fact she wants to bring home a cat NEXT WEEKEND and her best idea is to just ""hide the cat"" in her room??? that's so unrealistic and i've tried to convince her to think this through a bit more and try to save up a bit more money before getting a cat and planning things out instead of making a decision within a week but none of my words are getting through to her and it's so frustrating. Also , if she gets caught with a cat in her apartment without her having paid the down payment and monthly fee, she gets evicted. Like no questions asked, her apartment has that policy and yet she's STILL willing to take that risk with the excuse that ""i'm sure my parents will keep the cat for me then!"" or ""i'll find another apartment!"" like hello??? you live two hours away and i'm pretty sure your strict and anti-cat parents will not just happily accept the cat and raise it until you come back home from college and play with it. NEITHER will they let you just ""find another apartment"" and fully support that for you as well without consequences, like let's be fr.

i know that some of you might think this isn't my business or that i should stay out of it, but it's literally becoming impossible to do that when that's all she texts or calls me about and even when i steer the convo she brings it up. and I'm not just gonna shut her down and tell her to stop since if i do that she's literally gonna get the cat even sooner - i forgot to mention this but if it weren't for me confirming that she bought the stuff for the cat (food, litter, THE ESSENTIALS), she was gonna go and get the cat yesterday with no preparation whatsoever. she didn't even know if her apartment allowed cats or not until I asked her yesterday, like...I don't want to be a horrible friend or someone who's all up in someone else's business, but I feel like I can't just stand by and let this happen and see her get a cat with a romanticized view of it without having to face the cost of COSTS/expenses, the dirtywork, responsibilities, etc. but like ughhhhasdkfjasdfkjfsl

idk what to do anymore since she's so dead-set on getting that fucking cat. there's so many other ""wtf"" moments i didn't mention in this post but like oh my gosh. like I love cats and i know she CAN be responsible, but like i said before she literally cannot afford this cat and i feel like she's just expecting others to take responsibility FOR her if she can't. like come on now.

I do believe that her parents will come around EVENTUALLY, but she's a full-grown adult and i just feel like she cannot expect her parents to constantly support her like this when they're against her getting a cat right now (They literally told her she could think about it later when she's settled into college with a job and/or comfortably living). Like she's been kicked out of the house before, what makes her think they'll happily take in a cat and also pay the apartment's extra fees??

I know i keep repeating things but at this point, it's just so upsetting to hear her tell me all these plans about getting a cat this weekend when she a) does not have any of the essentials bought (nor ordered), b) cannot afford it, and all the other reasons i listed. like maybe i'm overstepping boundaries by telling her to try and plan things out/think about it for a bit more and save up, but it's just..asdflkasdjfaklsdfksdcasjf ahhhggggghhhh

I matched with a girl on a dating app about a month ago. Nothing in her profile suggested she was wealthy, and I’d say I’m doing pretty well myself. Honestly, I just swiped because I thought she was cute.

After a few days of texting, I asked her out for coffee and a walk in the park. The first date went really well, so well that it lasted long enough for her to suggest grabbing dinner since she was hungry. I figured I’d cover the bill, but she went straight to the server and paid before I even had the chance. I joked that I now owed her a meal if she was open to a second date, and she agreed.

Fast forward a month: we’ve been seeing each other 3-4 times a week, and things have been progressing quickly. We’ve hit several milestones (intimacy, sleepovers, her leaving things in my place, talking about what we’re looking for, exclusivity, even making travel plans and meeting her friends). Everything feels great, except for one thing that’s been on my mind.

The more time I spend with her, the more I realize just how well-off she is financially. And it’s not just her; her whole circle (friends and family) are all very successful: lawyers, doctors, traders, entrepreneurs. At one point she mentioned a friend moving abroad because “the pay here isn’t good enough” for their investment banking role. Then she casually dropped her friend’s “not good enough“ salary, and I was shocked; it was in the national top 5% income bracket. We’re all in our late twenties, so that floored me.

I come from a middle-class background. I work in IT/tech and earn a good salary myself (around the national top 15% income), but I can’t help feeling a bit out of place when I compare myself to her world. Especially since I'm more of a frugal type and what I splurge on occasionally, they seem to do it all the time.

(PS name and ages have been changed for reasons and pls forgive me if my grammar isn’t right)
So here’s the story, My now ex-BESTIE, Kiera(21FM) and i, Sofie(18FM) had been friends for 7yrs, you could say we were attached at the hip and were pretty much like sisters, things between us were pretty good in the beginning but my dad and siblings were never really supportive of our friendship because of a downfall between my Dad and Kiera’s parents. (story for another time) My dad and i always argued about it because he didn’t want me hanging out with Kiera or her family for the reason that they were just “using me”. i didn’t understand it at first but ever since i heard him say that, it kept replaying in my mind whenever me and Kiera hung out. For example, whenever we hung out most of the time i was the one paying for the gas, food, and other times she would ask me for money because she needed to pay for her package or girl things that she needs. which ofc i didn’t mind at first because she was my friend and there were times she payed me back like she would treat me to food when she had money and stuff like that but it was more of a rare occasion since her family aren’t well-off. (We aren’t either but my dad has a really strict budget or idk i think he just handles money really well so we manage) Everything was okay at first and i thought i had met my forever bestie, until recently i started noticing small things abt Kiera.. Idk if it was just in my head or not but i would notice that whenever we talked abt guys (the usual girl talk) she would always get sour when i would tell her that i was talking to a guy or if she knew i was friends with a guy because i was still “too immature” for it. But if it was with her, it was “okay” because “she knew how to handle her feelings”,(okayyy??) and there were times where i would vent to her abt my situations and yes she’d offer comfort but would also give me this indirect response of ‘suck it up, you’re not  the only one with problems (i knew that but i just wanted to vent to her because at the time i had no one else to turn to and she was my friend) i was kinda hurt by it but i didn’t take it to heart; but my last straw was when she proved to me that what my Dad said about her was true. see, like i said before, i was the one paying for us most of the time when we went out and i was really okay with it at first but then i started noticing that she had become expectant of it at times and she’d give me this pouty face and get annoyed at me whenever i refused to anything she requested. Like example we both like coffee and she would ask me to hangout and go buy food/snacks/coffee but from where we live they charge like alot for it so me trying to save my money i would rather just cook at home rather than spending my money on buying outside. but if i refuse her she would give me this pouty face and ignore me until i said yes. She does this to me every time i try to refuse knowing it would guilt trip me to saying yes to her. And in the end, i’d end up using all the money my dad had given me for the week in one day and she would always tell me ‘ don’t worry i’ll pay you back promise’ but she never did. My dad would get mad at me for these things but i didn’t mind it at first because i had thought to myself that she was my friend and it didn’t matter how much i spent on her; but after awhile i got so tired and pissed abt it being the reason my dad and i aren’t in good terms and i was just so drained and fed up with her behavior that one day i finally snapped. And so here’s where i might be the AH, after our last hangout, she went away for the weekend and i wasn’t able to talk to her in person so i sent her a text calling her out for her behavior and i said alot of rude things to her then blocked her without hearing her side of the story. I haven’t heard from her since and we both refuse to try and fix things. ",2,1756823851.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,2,1.0,False

We all know there's no magic time machine to stop our skin from aging. Wrinkles, fine lines, and spots are a natural part of the journey. But what if your skin is trying to tell you something more?

We've talked before about how **deep forehead wrinkles might be linked to cardiovascular health** (wild, right?).

But today, let's talk solutions. The internet is full of expensive creams and intense treatments, but what if you want to start simpler, cheaper, and more natural?

I've been digging into some research and found three surprisingly effective DIY masks. These use ingredients you might already have in your kitchen.

 

**1. The Soothing & Plumping Aloe Vera Mask**

Aloe vera isn't just for sunburns. The fresh gel is a powerhouse moisturizer that boosts skin elasticity.

·         **The Recipe:**

o    1 tbsp fresh aloe vera gel (15g)

o    1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil (16g)

o    ¼ cup brown sugar (50g) *- for gentle exfoliation*

·         **How to Use:** Mix it up, gently massage onto your face in circular motions for a minute, then let it sit for 5. Rinse with cold water and pat dry. **Do this 1-2 times a week.**

 

**2. The ""Fancy but Affordable"" Frankincense Serum**

This one sounds bougie, but it's a game-changer. Studies suggest frankincense oil is efficient for wrinkle prevention and has serious healing properties.

·         **The Recipe:**

o    6 drops of **high-quality frankincense essential oil**

o    30 ml of a carrier oil (almond, jojoba, or argan are great)

·         **How to Use:** Mix in a dropper bottle. Apply a few drops to your face AM and PM. ⚠️ **PATCH TEST THIS FIRST** on your inner arm to avoid any bad reactions.

 

**3. The Wake-Up-Your-Skin Coffee & Egg White Mask**

This 2013 study published in *Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine* found that topical coffee extract significantly reduces fine lines and improves skin tone. The egg white tightens everything up.

·         **The Recipe:**

o    1 egg white

o    ¼ tsp of freshly ground coffee (the finer, the better)

·         **How to Use:** Whip the egg white until frothy, mix in the coffee. Apply, let it dry completely (20-30 mins—you'll feel it tighten!), then rinse off.

 

**So, what do you think?**

·         Have you tried any of these before?

·         What's your go-to DIY skincare hack?

·         Any other natural ingredients I should research?

**Disclaimer:** I am not a dermatologist. Always patch test, especially with essential oils! These are great for maintenance and mild improvement, but for deep wrinkles, professional treatments are still the gold standard.

Ok so on Sunday morning we woke up to a HORRIBLE smell coming in through our bedroom window. 

I think (99% sure) what happened was a skunk sprayed in the grass outside our bedroom window. 

Here is what we have done so far, stripped and washed all bedding, washed curtains, mopped the floor. I went outside and sprayed our wall/window with vinegar water and then rinsed it with the hose.

I have been leaving bowls of coffee grounds in our room, and bowls of vinegar. I also have the window open and an air purifier and a fan going. 

Oh also I saged the f out of the room because why not. 

It is much better but still not ready to sleep in there yet. Currently sleeping on some play fort cushions on the floor of my toddlers room. 

Cleaning people please tell me if there is anything else I can do! 
Thank you!

We got close fast. She had already been married, divorced, and had a baby. Despite that, we started dating. She told me she loved me, and eventually I said it back.

Everything seemed to be going great, but I had this instinct that something wasn’t right. One day, she started acting cold and rude. I stayed calm, but whenever I said something, she accused me of speaking with a bad tone. I tried to be patient, but eventually I couldn’t take it anymore. I told her I had somewhere to go, asked if she wanted to go home, but she said to just drop her back at the coffee shop. That day, I didn’t speak to her.

The next day, I called her. She was acting weird and passive-aggressive, so I told her we should talk in the evening. Later, I called her, but she didn’t pick up. I called multiple times from evening till night. I was anxious and angry because I felt there was no reason for her to act like this.

Finally, I told myself, fuck this shit, I’m not going through this drama again. (Because id my previous relationship) I instantly blocked her, told her goodbye, and erased her number.

The next day, she we didn't contacted each other At that point, I started feeling bad. I wondered if I had made a mistake by acting that way.

The next day, I called her again. She answered. I asked if she was coming to work, and she said yes. I waited for her there. She came, and we talked. I apologized, told her I had an anxiety crisis, and admitted I was wrong. She got emotional and even cried a little. I told her I would make it up to her and fix things.

But for the rest of the day, she was still acting cold and weird. At night, we talked, hugged, and kissed. I opened up and told her I have anxiety that sometimes takes over me. She said why didn't you told me and that she comprehend and thatvshe would know how to act Then She said we needed space. I thought things were fine after that, but the next day she kept acting distant and even disrespectful.

So I stayed away. Then she stopped calling and messaging. I didn’t contacted her either After a couple of days, I saw her across the street with another guy. I ignored her.

Honestly, I didn’t feel too bad at first. I carried myself as usual, but deep down, I felt terrible. Because if she moved on so fast, it probably meant that guy was already in the picture.

So what I want to say is this: I just wanted to share my story. Maybe my instincts were right and I actually made the right choice by cutting her off. I’m sure about not going back to her, and I don’t give a fuck about her now. But for some reason, I still feel bad inside, and I don’t really know why.a

Try the **Udupi Style Goli Baje Recipe**, also known as **Mangalore Bajji** or **Mangalore Bonda**. This crispy, golden fritter is a popular tea-time snack from the temple town of Udupi in Karnataka.

Whether you call it **Goli Baje**, **Mangalore Bajji**, or **Mangalore Bonda**, one thing is certain – it’s a dish that combines tradition, flavor, and comfort in every bite.

# What is Goli Baje?

Goli Baje is a **deep-fried snack made with all-purpose flour, yogurt, and spices**. The batter is mixed and allowed to rest, which makes the fritters light and fluffy on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside. It’s typically served with **coconut chutney** and a steaming cup of filter coffee.

This snack has its roots in **Udupi cuisine**, which is famous for its simple yet flavorful vegetarian dishes. Goli Baje is especially loved during **monsoons and winters**, when hot snacks bring extra comfort.

# Ingredients for Udupi Style Goli Baje

To prepare this traditional **Mangalore Bajji Recipe**, you’ll need:

* All-purpose flour (maida) – 1 cup
* Yogurt (curd) – ½ cup (slightly sour works best)
* Rice flour – 2 tbsp
* Ginger – 1 tsp (finely chopped)
* Green chili – 1 (chopped)
* Curry leaves – 6–8 (finely chopped)
* Cumin seeds – ½ tsp
* Baking soda – a pinch
* Salt – to taste
* Oil – for deep frying

# How to Make Goli Baje (Step-by-Step)

1. **Prepare the batter** – In a bowl, whisk yogurt until smooth. Add all-purpose flour, rice flour, ginger, green chili, curry leaves, cumin, and salt. Mix into a thick batter.
2. **Rest the batter** – Add a pinch of baking soda, cover, and rest the batter for at least 30 minutes. This helps the fritters turn soft and fluffy.
3. **Heat the oil** – Place a deep frying pan on medium flame and heat oil.
4. **Fry the fritters** – Take small portions of batter and gently drop into hot oil. Fry until golden brown and crisp.
5. **Serve hot** – Drain on paper towels and serve with coconut chutney or tomato ketchup.

# Tips for Perfect Mangalore Bajji

* Resting the batter is key – it gives a nice fluffy texture.
* Fry on **medium flame** so the inside cooks well without burning the outside.
* Use slightly sour curd for the authentic Udupi-style taste.

# Why You’ll Love Goli Baje

* Quick to prepare with easily available ingredients.
* Perfect companion for chai or filter coffee.
* A snack that suits **kids, adults, and guests alike**.

1n6l0n1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterOpening/comments/1n6l0n1/delve_into_method_me451_glass_cleaner_is_it/,Delve Into Method ME-451 Glass Cleaner Is It Really Streak Free,"Testing products regularly has made me quite particular about what performs well and what doesn’t. When it comes to glass cleaners, streak-free results and eco-friendly ingredients often top my list of priorities. That’s why I was curious about the Method ME-451, a “Waterfall” scented glass and surface cleaner boasting plant-based powergreen technology. After a few weeks of use, it's safe to say I have mixed feelings about it.

**Design and Packaging**  
The bottle itself stands out on my cleaning shelf, thanks to its sleek, modern design and vibrant blue-tinted packaging. It’s sturdy enough to withstand an accidental drop, which my clumsy self appreciated more than once. The spray nozzle is well-designed too, offering a fine mist that distributes the product evenly across surfaces with minimal effort. However, the cap feels a bit flimsy, which made me question its durability over time.

**Effectiveness on Glass Surfaces**  
During testing, I used this product on mirrors, windows, and even the glass-top coffee table my kids love to smudge. The Method ME-451 promises a gleaming, streak-free shine, and it mostly delivers. The results on mirrors were fantastic—no streaks, no haze, just clean, sparkling surfaces. On larger windows, I noticed needing a bit more elbow grease to remove stubborn spots, which wasn’t ideal. Still, the absence of a chemical stench was a big win for my sensitive nose. 

[Check Method ME-451 price on Amazon.](https://go.senaar.com/p/b00ktc9psm/)

**Performance on Other Surfaces**  
While primarily marketed as a glass cleaner, the product doubles as a surface cleaner. I tested it on countertops, the dashboard of my car, and even my stainless steel fridge. It works surprisingly well on miscellaneous surfaces, handling dust, light stains, and fingerprints without much fuss. However, on oilier or grimier spots, it felt less effective, requiring a second round of spraying. 

**Upsides**  
• Features an ammonia-free formula, making it safe for both users and surfaces.  
• The plant-based powergreen technology is environmentally friendly.  
• Leaves a pleasant “waterfall” scent without overwhelming the senses.  
• Doubles as a surface cleaner for versatile use.  

**Areas of Concern**  
• Struggles with tougher stains and requires additional effort.  
• The spray nozzle’s durability, although decent, could be further improved.  

**Scent and Sensitivity**  
The signature “waterfall” fragrance quickly became one of my favorite features. It’s subtle, fresh, and doesn’t leave that chemical stank you’d often associate with household cleaning products. For someone sensitive to strong odors, this was a refreshing shift. That said, fragrance preferences vary, so it may not be a hit with individuals who prefer completely unscented products.

**Rival Brands**  
In comparison to other popular glass cleaners like Windex and Seventh Generation Glass Cleaner, the Method ME-451 offers a more eco-conscious and non-toxic approach to cleaning. While Windex might win on sheer cleaning power for tougher tasks, it doesn’t provide the same commitment to environmentally friendly ingredients. On the flip side, Seventh Generation offers comparable safety credentials, but its scent options lean more herbal, which may not appeal to everyone. Method stands out by striking a balance; however, the cleaning performance isn’t always as robust against heavy grime.

**True Value**  
Considering its dual-purpose nature as both a glass and general surface cleaner, this product delivers decent value. While it costs a bit more than conventional glass cleaners, you’re paying for the non-toxic, biodegradable formula and a commitment to cruelty-free manufacturing. For someone invested in eco-friendly products, it’s likely worth the splurge. However, if you prioritize raw cleaning strength over green attributes, other options might suit your needs better.

So about 2 years ago I (36) met a woman, let's call her D (31) through a hobby. We exchanged numbers, became friends. About the last 6 months I felt a change. We talked more often, met privately, had dinners and talked deeper. I developed feelings and told her about it. Her reply? Well no reply to be honest. She said she likes me as well but always had a way of talking around the bush.

So whenever I became more attached she pulled away and vice versa. I then met another woman (let's call her ""H""), had a few dates and a great time. D heard about it, got extremely jealous and started flirting with me intensely and also hooking up with me. She told me about her jealousy and so I cut ties with H. That should have been a red flag.

And from then on it was hot and cold. Sometimes she was very attached, emotional, planned a few dates in a row with me just to disappear completely for days and then suddenly reply to me like I am just an acquaintance and be very distant.

Last week she went on vacation with a friend and from one day to another there was another huge shift. On Monday she still sent me pictures and reached out, on Tuesday it became already less and on Wednesday she was totally different. I thought to myself. Well she is on vacation, let's wait for her to come back.

But she didn't reach out after return, when I contacted her she was very very distant and when I asked for a date she just replied ""I dont want to plan stuff right now"". When I asked if everything is okay between us she just replied ""I guess"".

Well, today she sent me a picture of her in a coffee place but wrote underneath a text that was clearly supposed to be for someone else (not flirty or anything but just addressed someone else).

She didn't even notice. So I just replied ""Have fun"". Instead of replying she just deleted the picture.

I then wrote her a longer message, explaining that I cant do this anymore. Those hot and cold phases, those emotional back and forths. That she knows that I have emotions for her and that it is fine if she doesn't feel the same but I just wanted clarity for once because one day she plans trips and dates and wants exclusivity and the next day she ignores me, forgets about things we have planned.

Rationally I know it is for the best to stop contact but right now I just feel worthless and stupid for playing in a game where I was the loser from the beginning.",1,1756823162.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

Alt text: Corporate professionals in a business meeting, reflecting Bahrain’s dynamic corporate environment.. GDP is forecasted to grow by 3.2% in 2025, with fintech, logistics, and tourism leading the charge (source: Gulf News Bahrain updates). Government reforms have accelerated company formations, and Bahrain.com touts strong FDI flows thanks to 99% foreign ownership allowances in many sectors.\
Bahrain’s labor law structure is designed to balance business flexibility with fair employee treatment, making the Kingdom a smart choice for both regional and international entrepreneurs. Unlike Saudi Arabia’s sponsorship-heavy system, Bahrain’s Sijilat platform offers digital-first, time-saving processes—though patience is still advised during Ramadan, when government hours shift.\
Business customs matter here. Meetings often begin with a round of Arabic coffee, and the informal majlis discussion style remains influential even during legal negotiations. Experience has taught me never to underestimate these local nuances—they often tip the scales when critical decisions are being made.\
\
End-of-Service Benefits: Law, Calculations, and 2025 Updates\
What Are End-of-Service Benefits in Bahrain?\
End-of-service benefits (EOSB) are mandatory payments employers make to employees upon contract completion, resignation, or dismissal (with some exceptions). They act similarly to severance pay, compensating for years of service under Bahrain’s Labour Law for the Private Sector, Law No. 36 of 2012.\
Recent Change (2025): Effective January 1st, 2025, per Labor Ministry Circular No. 14/2024, the maximum delay for final EOSB payment reduced from 30 days to 14 days, with fines doubling for late settlements. This update has made prompt compliance more important than ever.\
Who Is Eligible?\
\
Full-time employees—Bahraini and non-Bahraini—under indefinite or fixed contracts.\
Exclusions: Employees dismissed for gross misconduct or those not meeting minimum continuous service (usually 12 months).\
Also applies in commercial free zones—see Bahrain Free Zones.\
\
How Are End-of-Service Benefits Calculated?\
Basic Calculation Method:\
- Employees are entitled to 15 days’ wage per year for the first three years of service.\
- After three years, entitlement rises to one month’s wage for each year of service.\
- Calculation is based on the last drawn basic salary, excluding allowances.\
\
Practical Example: A foreign accountant earning BHD 600/month, employed for 5 years, would receive:\
\
First 3 years: 15 days x 3 = 45 days’ wage (BHD 900)\
Next 2 years: 1 month x 2 = 2 months’ wage (BHD 1,200)\
Total EOSB: BHD 2,100\
\
\
For part-years, pro-rata calculations apply—always round up partial months.\
Note: If the employee resigns voluntarily, they may receive a reduced amount based on timing. Check the latest official government guide for calculation charts and case-specific exceptions.\
What’s New For 2025?\
\
Payment deadline now 14 days.\
Notification to LMRA and Sijilat within 3 business days.\
Stronger enforcement: fines can reach BHD 5,000 for delayed or incorrect processing.\
Mandatory issuance of payment slips via MOICT’s e-Portal.\
\
(When I first processed a large layoff in Bahrain, I underestimated internal audit requirements. I recommend prepping all termination, salary, and leave records before even starting the EOSB form—otherwise, expect at least one painful ministry visit.)\
\
Types of Bahrain Business Structures and EOSB Implications\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in Bahrain: diverse business meeting..\
Common Structures:\
With each, consider both EOSB budgeting and payroll compliance from the outset.\
\
WLL (With Limited Liability): Most popular—no Bahraini partner required for many sectors.\
BSC (Closed or Public): Suited for larger, multi-shareholder businesses.\
Branch Office: For international companies expanding into Bahrain.\
Sole Proprietorship: Lower EOSB exposure, but limited growth potential.\
\
Foreign Ownership Advantages\
Bahrain outpaces the UAE by allowing up to 99% foreign ownership in diverse sectors (details here). No local sponsor needed unless in regulated industries—critical for full control over payroll and employee benefits policy.\
(Personally, I’ve seen even modest startups in the Seef District choose WLL for cost and flexibility—it’s the safest structure for quick, compliant EOSB handling.)\
\
End-of-Service Benefits: Detailed Step-By-Step Settlement Process\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation: business documents and workflow for EOSB. on EOSB settlements:**\
1. Preparation\
\
Complete payroll reconciliation for separating employees. Double-check leave balances and overtime records.\
Verify contract type and reason for separation.\
Gather past payslips and copies of all labor contract amendments.\
\
2. Calculation and Documentation\
\
Calculate EOSB using MOICT’s online estimator.\
Prepare EOSB statement (official template recommended).\
Print final payroll ledger and payment voucher.\
Time-saver: Submit EOSB application via Sijilat after 2 pm—queues are shorter post-lunch, especially Sunday through Wednesday.\
\
3. Submission and Notification\
\
Notify LMRA via online portal.\
Notify Sijilat and MOICT (3 business days required by law).\
Arrange for employee sign-off and witness list (Majlis-style meetings can help resolve disputes before they escalate).\
\
4. Payment and Compliance\
\
Pay the EOSB within 14 days—bank transfer is now preferred (and required documentation for audits).\
Issue payslip and signed settlement letter.\
Update personnel file and scan all documents.\
\
Insider Tip:\
During Ramadan, adjust your process—government offices often close by 1 pm and staffing drops.\
The best office to visit for processing large staff settlements: MOICT in Diplomatic Area, ground floor service counter—never try at 11 am on Thursdays; queues can spill out the door.\
Full compliance and ongoing payroll support: Accounting and Bookkeeping in Bahrain.\
\
Cost Considerations: Budgeting for End-of-Service Benefits\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs: calculator and business finance for EOSB budgeting.\
Average EOSB Financial Impact\
\
For a typical SME, expect annual EOSB accruals of BHD 2,000–20,000+, depending on workforce size and composition.\
Standard calculation: Accrue 8.33% of annual base payroll for EOSB liabilities.\
2025 regulatory update: Non-compliance can now trigger BHD 5,000+ fines per incident.\
\
See cost breakdowns and tips at Bahrain Company Formation Cost.\
Budget-Friendly Tips\
\
Review your EOSB accruals quarterly, not just at year-end.\
Consider payroll insurance if headcount exceeds 20.\
Outsource payroll to avoid calculation errors and maintain audit trails.\

\
Alt text: Professional business support: business consultation and support services..\
Off-Topic, But Actually Relevant…\
During one particularly busy audit season, I was invited to a boardroom majlis in the Diplomatic Area—ostensibly to discuss VAT, but within minutes, the conversation shifted to EOSB processes and the best time for contract closures. Turns out, in Bahrain, even VAT specialists are expected to know labor law inside out—proving how deeply embedded EOSB understanding is in the business world here.\
\
Comparison: Bahrain vs UAE and Saudi Arabia\
Bahrain’s EOSB system is more transparent and less dependent on local sponsorship compared to Saudi Arabia. In the UAE, gratuity payments are broadly similar—yet Bahrain’s tighter timeframes and digital processes provide an edge.\
\
Bahrain: Payment within 14 days, strong digital filing, 99% foreign ownership.\
UAE: Up to 30 days, more paperwork, recent reforms aligning with Bahrain.\
Saudi Arabia: Sponsorship and end-of-service entitlements, but more layers and slower processes.\
\
\
FAQ: End-of-Service Benefits & Bahrain Company Formation\
1. How quickly must EOSB be paid in 2025?\
Within 14 days of termination. Fines for late payment now start at BHD 1,000 and can reach BHD 5,000.\
Learn the latest at Company Formation Process in Bahrain.\
2. Does the type of business entity affect EOSB liability?\
Yes. Entities with larger staff numbers or higher turnover (like WLL and BSC) face bigger EOSB exposures.\
See entity options at Bahrain Business Structures.\
3. Do free zones change EOSB rules?\
No. Free zone staff are covered by Bahrain Labor Law, including all EOSB rights.\
Review Free Zones in Bahrain.\
4. Are there ways to reduce EOSB costs legally?\
Maintain clear records, manage contracts proactively, and use digital payroll solutions. Outsourcing HR and payroll often saves money.\
Check cost-saving strategies at Bahrain Company Formation Cost.\
5. What is the most common mistake with EOSB?\
Missing the notification deadline or underpaying due to poor documentation.\
Ensure compliance with Accounting & Bookkeeping Services.\
\
Ultimately, Bahrain’s business-friendly policies, advanced digital systems, and strong labor protections make it not just easy but smart to run a company here—if you respect both the letter and the spirit of the local labor law. And never forget the power of a well-timed cup of Bahraini coffee to solve even the trickiest compliance snag.\

1n6kwk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1n6kwk0/delve_into_why_febreze_fabric_deodorizer_is_a/,Delve Into Why Febreze Fabric Deodorizer Is a Household Favorite,"**Everyday Use and First Impressions**

Using the Febreze 30772118764 has become part of my daily cleaning ritual. As someone living in a home bustling with children, pets, and the occasional chaos they bring, keeping fabrics fresh often feels like an uphill battle. I was curious whether the promise of ""odor-fighting magic"" would live up to the hype. The moment I first sprayed it, the Downy April Fresh scent immediately filled the space, creating an inviting and clean atmosphere. The instructions were straightforward—spray onto fabrics until they’re damp, let them dry, and forget the stink. It worked like a charm. Even the deeply entrenched odors in my living room sofa and pet bedding significantly diminished after a couple of uses.

**Ease of Application**

This odor-fighting spray is incredibly easy to use. The 16.9 fl oz bottle fits comfortably in one hand, making it simple to maneuver while tackling various surfaces. I’ve used it on everything from throw pillows to the kids’ plush toys, and even my teenager’s gym bag, which was practically a science experiment. The spray nozzle delivers an even mist, not too aggressive, and ensures wide coverage without soaking the fabric excessively. To my surprise, there’s no sticky residue left behind, and the drying time feels reasonable—it’s perfect for a quick touch-up when guests are on their way.

**Upsides**

- Effectively eliminates odors from fabrics rather than merely masking them.
- Infuses an uplifting Downy April Fresh scent, reminiscent of freshly laundered linens.
- Free from phthalates, formaldehyde, and flammable chemicals.
- Versatile application on items like couch cushions, gym gear, and more.  
- Doesn’t leave any damp odors or sticky sensations upon drying.

**Design and Functionality**

The Febreze bottle is thoughtfully designed. Its compact size and ergonomic shape make it easy to grip, even during extended use for larger areas. The spray mechanism feels robust and hasn’t clogged once, even after several weeks of daily handling. I appreciate the simple yet practical packaging, which lays out everything you need to know at a glance—no confusion, no tiny print surprises.

**Effectiveness on Stubborn Odors**

When it comes to hard-to-get-rid-of smells, like the ones lurking in upholstered furniture or car seats, this product truly rises to the challenge. Recently, I spilled coffee on my work chair, and while I cleaned it physically, the faint sour smell lingered. A solid spritz of this fabric spray completely erased it. The same thing happened with the dog’s bed after a muddy day at the park—gone, as if by magic. However, I noticed that extremely dense fabrics like wool coats may require an additional application or two for optimal results.

**Areas for Improvement**

- The strong scent, though pleasant, can feel overpowering in small, poorly ventilated spaces.
- While it’s great for freshening, it doesn’t replace deep cleaning—stubborn stains still require other solutions.  
- The drying process could take slightly longer on thicker materials, which might not appeal to someone in a hurry.

**Competing Brands**

Compared to other fabric refreshers like Lysol or Arm & Hammer sprays, I found this product more pleasant to use on a daily basis. Lysol’s formula often feels harsher, and its scent lacks the inviting quality of Febreze. However, Lysol does boast additional antibacterial properties that might appeal to certain users. Arm & Hammer sprays, meanwhile, seem to rely heavily on baking soda, which sometimes leaves a detectable white residue on dark fabrics. Febreze stands out for its balance of odor elimination and a comforting fragrance, even if it lacks sterilizing features.

**Value for Money**

From my perspective, what makes this fabric refresher stand out is how well it balances performance and cost-efficiency. For a multi-surface odor-fighting solution that doesn’t compromise on fragrance quality, it feels almost indulgent on a practical budget. While comparable products might carry similar scents or stronger claims, this one lives up to realistic expectations and integrates seamlessly into both high-use households or occasional usage scenarios.

I don’t pick my nose or anything but I keep dealing with nosebleeds. I also use astopro from time to time but I’ve been using that for YEARS.

Last time I brought this up with my doctor/nurse practitioner a year ago, they dismissed it. Originally it was around when I was about to have my period and I brought that up if there is connection with the two.  Now almost a year later, especially after my dog passed I’ve been dealing with nosebleeds more frequently. I noticed I get them the worse after drinking coffee, which made me not drink it as much, but clearly every time I drink coffee like two days in a row it starts up again, or even before my period at times they start again. They’re not major just minor ones that top after ten minutes. I think the one I just had today was around that much and was a lot but again it was after drinking coffee and eating a chocolate muffin.

I use to get nosebleeds in college due to stress at times near finals but then it stopped after I graduated. Is this all just stress or high blood pressure related?

I’m not seeing my nurse practitioner/doctor until November for my annual, should I maybe bring it up again and try to advocate for myself. My family’s concerned given the frequency but I’m almost positive it’s because of high blood pressure or even stress.

1n6kuw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1n6kuw4/why_aieve_cord_organizer_review_shows_a_musthave/,Why Aieve Cord Organizer Review Shows a Must-Have for Kitchen Appliances,"The Aieve B09MZ41Z9Q, specifically designed as a cord organizer for various kitchen appliances, has been a game changer in my kitchen setup. I’ve been testing it diligently for a couple of months, and I’ve experienced both its strengths and its flaws firsthand. This handy addition is something I didn’t realize I needed until it became part of my daily routine—taming the seemingly endless, chaotic cords of my small appliances.

**Design and Material Quality**  
The silicone material used in this cord organizer stands out as its most defining feature. Sleek yet functional, it feels sturdy, and there’s a slight elasticity that ensures the holder doesn’t wear out prematurely. The compact dimensions, at 4.23 x 1.16 x 0.1 inches, make it versatile enough for almost any appliance, from my bulky pressure cooker to my slimline toaster. The dark grey and white color options blend nicely with modern kitchen aesthetics. After multiple uses, I noticed the silicone doesn’t crack or get sticky, which can often be an issue with lesser materials. On the downside, while the adhesive backing is strong, it sometimes struggles on slightly textured appliance surfaces.  

**Ease of Installation**  
One of the main selling points here is its installation process. The super sticky nano glue does its job well—adhering firmly to flat surfaces in my kitchen. I attached it to my coffee maker, air fryer, and blender without any hassle. However, I’d recommend cleaning the surface with alcohol before applying to ensure it sticks properly. Though most kitchen appliances worked fine with the adhesive, I had some difficulty with a pressure cooker that had a slightly bumpy finish—something to note if your appliances aren’t perfectly smooth.

Check [Aieve B09MZ41Z9Q price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b09mz41z9q/)

**Practicality and Usability**  
I tend to juggle multiple appliances daily, and this cord organizer streamlined my kitchen in a way that saved me time and frustration. The design, which allows you to wind up cords with one hand, feels intuitive and well-thought-out. It worked effectively for most cords; however, it’s worth noting it’s primarily compatible with 70% of kitchen equipment cords, as per the claims. My juicer’s thick, rigid cord was a bit cumbersome to wrap around it properly. That said, for standard appliances like blenders, toasters, and air fryers, it wraps cords like a charm.

**Advantages**  
- High-quality silicone that doesn’t deform easily.  
- Super sticky nano glue keeps it firmly in place.  
- Compact size that suits a wide range of appliances.  
- Helps declutter and organize even small kitchens.  

**Disadvantages**  
- Doesn’t stick well to bumpy or textured appliance surfaces.  
- Bulky appliance cords may not fit as cleanly as intended.  

**Effectiveness Over Time**  
After weeks of constant use, I can confidently say that these organizers are durable. They don’t loosen their grip on cords or detach unexpectedly. Even when I accidentally left my blender running for a while and it heated slightly—the glue held up. However, I did notice that heavier appliances like a KitchenAid mixer needed an occasional second press due to the additional strain on the adhesive, especially during the first few days of use.  

**Alternative Options**  
If you’re browsing for similar products, there are a handful of competitors out there like Home N’ Goods cable wraps and the Cableyoyo cord holders. While both share functionality with the Aieve model, they often lack the silicone flexibility and super adhesive strength present here. The Home N’ Goods wrap is harder to clean, and Cableyoyo can’t adhere strongly enough to vertical surfaces, so the Aieve tends to outperform them in durability and range of mounting options. That said, Cableyoyo does feature an appealing minimalist design, which might win people who prioritize visual aesthetic over practicality.

**Budget-Friendly**  
With a six-pack in the box, this product delivers impressive value. You’re essentially buying a solution to declutter a wide range of appliances—this is a solid approach to cost-effectiveness. While other products out there sell similar packs, Aieve strikes a balance between manageable pricing and quality assurance.

Advertised as an all-purpose cleaner, this product promises to tackle grime and dirt in just seven minutes. That claim alone made me eager to try it out on various surfaces around the house. Spoiler alert: it did a lot right but had a few quirks, too. Here's how it went.

**Packaging and Design**  
The packaging is straightforward: a slim, lightweight bottle, easy to hold, and compact enough to store almost anywhere. With dimensions of 7.17 x 1.65 x 1.5 inches, the bottle slides right into any cabinet or even under the sink without hogging space. As someone whose cleaning supplies tend to spill out of overcrowded shelves, I appreciated the thoughtful, space-saving design. It’s also worth noting that at only 7.37 ounces, it’s incredibly lightweight, a plus for anyone who dislikes lugging bulky cleaning sprays around.

**Ease of Use**  
Using the cleaner couldn’t be simpler—it’s your classic spritz-and-wipe product. The nozzle delivers a consistent spray that coats surfaces evenly without making a mess or puddling. The 7-minute waiting period suggested on the label is fairly manageable, especially when cleaning stubborn stains or grime. I tested it on everything from a greasy stovetop to bathroom tiles, and it performed surprisingly well. However, on areas that needed heavy-duty cleaning, I found myself waiting just a bit longer than the promised seven minutes.

Check [FLAP B091N8X9CQ](https://info.senaar.com/p/b091n8x9cq/) price on Amazon.

**Performance**  
The real test came in its ability to live up to the 7-minute claim. I experimented with this all-purpose cleaner in multiple scenarios—kitchen counters stained with marinara sauce, soap scum-coated sinks, and an old coffee spill on the living room table. In most cases, the product delivered clean surfaces without excessive scrubbing, which honestly took a massive load off my shoulders.

Its wipe-off results were consistent and left no sticky residue, something that I know drives a lot of people nuts with other cleaners. That said, tackling tougher stains like baked-on grime in an oven required a second application, making me wish it packed a bit more punch.

**Benefits**  
- Compact and lightweight design for easy storage  
- User-friendly spray nozzle with consistent coverage  
- Effective on a variety of surfaces from kitchen counters to bathroom tiles  
- Residue-free finish leaving surfaces clean and refreshed  

**Negatives**  
- Not powerful enough for heavy-duty cleaning without a second application  
- Waiting just over seven minutes for tough stains may be necessary  
- A somewhat generic scent, which is neither impressive nor bothersome  

**Product Competitors**  
When stacking this cleaner up against some of its competitors like Method All-Purpose Cleaner or Mrs. Meyer's Multi-Surface Everyday Cleaner, the FLAP B091N8X9CQ holds its own in terms of ease of use and performance. While Method comes with lovely fragrance options and Mrs. Meyer's offers plant-based ingredients, the 7-minute cleaner leans on its efficiency and no-frills approach. However, the lack of a distinctive scent or eco-friendly appeal might make it a second choice for some.

For budget-conscious folks or those who prioritize results over extras like fragrance, this cleaner could be a more logical choice.

**Bang for the Buck**  
One thing I kept thinking about while using this product was whether it gave good value for its price. For its size and performance, I think it does offer solid cost efficiency. Sure, there are alternatives with more features like eco-friendliness or premium packaging, but this cleaner cuts to the chase with simplicity and results. It’s not about flashy labels; it’s about functionality, plain and simple.

Cognitive scientists have a saying:​

“Maslow before Bloom”​

It’s the idea that if we want to engage in ‘higher-order thinking’ (Bloom’s Taxonomy), we need to fulfill basic human needs like sleep, food, rest, etc.… (Maslow’s Hierarchy).

And it makes sense.

Imagine trying to learn graduate-level physics with no sleep, intoxicated and as hungry as a bear after hibernation.

It would be a nightmare.

Fulfilling these needs should hold priority over any extra time you would’ve gained from studying or learning. Learning is only secondary.



2. Don’t learn if you won’t implement​

An easy way to forget what you learn is to never use it.

Research shows that retrieval (withdrawing information from long-term memory into conscious awareness) can improve memory by up to 50%- if done within a 24-hour time frame.

The issue we face when letting time pass is that our memory quickly drops after learning something new — this effect is modeled by the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve.

So, even if it’s a quick retrieval session (a few minutes), it’s worth doing.  
​

3. Active Learning > Passive Learning​

Learning techniques require active engagement.

Zoning out while reading textbooks or watching lectures won’t cut it.

1 hour spent:

* Constructing knowledge
* Creating inferences
* Applying knowledge

Will always outweigh 4 hours spent passively reading textbooks or listening to lectures.

It’s a habit you’ll acquire over time, so long as you practice self-awareness and push yourself to engage.

But without it, you can’t learn effectively.

4. Good learning requires cognitive discomfort​

Quality learning comes from quality thinking.

And if you’re not using your brain’s mental resources, you’re not learning.

This principle underlies most learning techniques.

But, it’s also a useful litmus test you can use to see whether you’re engaging in the right type of thinking.

5. How to stop banging your head against the wall​

We often waste hours struggling to understand a concept or solve a problem, hoping things click.

When the real issue (more often than not) is that we’ve processed the text from the wrong perspective.

Solution?

Take a break. Work on something else, and give your mind time to enter a diffused state so that it has a fresh set of eyes.

This will allow you to interpret what you’ve read differently the next time around, increasing the chances that it makes sense.  
​

6. Practice beyond mastery is (usually) a waste of time​

You’ve (likely) spent hours practicing the same exercises (static repetition), over and over again, with little to no gain.

This (usually) stems from the belief that more practice leads to more learning.

However, this argument leaves out two key details:​

* Little to no learning occurs once you reach unconscious incompetence with minimal errors.​
* Opportunity cost exists. So, based on your learning stage would other techniques have led to better outcomes?​

When we consider this, we find that static repetition (in general) is a waste of time.

So what’s the alternative?

Variable practice.

This type of practice uses drills, problems, and exercises across different contexts and with different variables.

This approach to practice increases your surface area of learning (ensuring your time is well spent).

7. Research experts.​

At the start of a learning project, we have no new knowledge to build on.

This makes it one of the hardest learning stages.

But we can short-cut the time it takes to build a base level of knowledge by spending time learning how experts think about a subject.

By researching:​

* Mental Models
* General Principles
* Important Categories​

etc…

We create a foundation for new knowledge to build on, and we save ourselves the time it would’ve taken to build it from scratch.

8. Always Plan​

Expert learners are self-regulated learners.

And it’s because good planning precedes good learning.

And if you don’t plan, you end up with unfocused effort and half-learned concepts.

How much time you plan should depend on the nature and quantity of content. I aim to spend 5% of my learning time planning and reflecting on learning outcomes.

Doing this will keep your sessions more focused, which will lead to more learning.  
​

9. Avoid distractions​

1 hour of deep study > 4 hours of distracted learning.

Nail this mantra into your head every day.

It’s one of the reasons we struggle to learn anything meaningful.

Our brain processes a limited amount of information, and wasting its resources by focusing on brain-rotting internet videos is doing you a disservice.  
​

10. You’re not born an expert learner.​

Most social environments (home, school, friends) make us believe that intelligence is the only predictor of learning outcomes.

But that’s false.

Learning skills (among other variables) tend to matter more.

And learning skills (like anything) are learnable, which means that even if you find it hard to learn new things, you can get better.

This is an essential perspective to have as you work your way to become a better learner.  
​

11. Knowledge Obsessed.​

In an interview with Yorkshire Television, Richard Feynman (a well-known physicist) made an interesting point that I remember to this day.

In his words:

“If you give me the right man, in any field, I can talk to him. But I know what the condition is, that he did whatever he did, to go as far as he could go!”

I still get goosebumps hearing it.

His observation was that certain kinds of men/women (in any field) are always looking to stretch their minds as far as they can go.

They’re never satisfied with what they know, and they’re always looking to learn more.

It’s a core tenant of being great at whatever skill you choose to learn.  
​

Here’s the link: [Richard Feynman — The World from another point of view](https://preview.convertkit-mail2.com/click/dpheh0hzhm/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1HTmhsTlNMUUFGRQ==)

12. Big picture overview → Fine-tuned details​

Imagine you’re given the task of building a house.

Most of us would build a base, carve out some details, then add some final touches and furniture.

That would be the most logical plan.

But we tend to overlook the same logic when learning.

​  
Instead of:​

Base Knowledge → Ideas → Details​

We do:​

Details → Ideas → Base Knowledge​

When we insist on understanding every detail (instead of skimming around and then diving deeper) we start at the wrong learning layer and waste time as a result.

This one behavior (if changed) will easily become the highest-leverage learning activity in your tool belt (saving you mountains of time).

13. The anecdote to most learning problems​

Most learning problems can be solved by better understanding the topic.

This means:​

* More connections
* Improved knowledge structures
* More prior knowledge integration​

From memory issues to trouble applying or thinking critically, I’ve (almost) always solved these problems by improving my understanding.

It’s a good reference point to have when you feel stuck- it’s often the answer.

14. Space your studies​

This ranks among the best learning techniques in most studies (specifically for long-term retention).

And the best part?

It’s not about engaging your brain in a certain way, but about organizing your studies differently than you do now.

Instead of learning a lot in a short period, you spread out your learning sessions on a topic.

I’d recommend doing a 1-day/1-week/1-month split for everything you learn.

(This means retrieving it in those intervals)

15. Feedback is overpowered​

Action produces information.

And this information (feedback) can reveal hidden gaps in our knowledge.

These small (or large) corrections found in how we understand and apply what we’ve learned are crucial for getting the details in our knowledge right.

They’re a natural part of learning since we might process information incorrectly or miss important features.

The more feedback loops you cycle through, the better you’ll get.

16. Refine your perspective​

A theme you find among experts is the # of books they read on a given topic.

More books = More knowledge.

And reading books about a topic from different perspectives allows you to expand on what you know.

In cognitive psychology, this technique is known as variable encoding.

It’s one of the best ways to build a large interconnected web of knowledge once you’ve already reached an intermediate level of understanding.  
​

17. Long-Term Learning.​

We’ve been taught to learn for challenges that are just around the corner.

The next test, the next presentation, the next project, etc.

But doing so can make us blind to what matters most- long-term learning.

Instead, we want to learn with the end in mind.

And we do this through knowledge maintenance.

Ask yourself:

* How will I use this information in the long term?
* What exercises can I do to test myself?
* How often should I revisit this, factoring in its importance? ​

If you reflect on these questions, you’ll be able to create a plan that allows for a lasting understanding.

18. Learning > Performance​

Successful students and self-learners alike focus on learning > performing.

And the irony is that doing so leads to better learning outcomes- all while keeping the motivation to learn high.

If I had to narrow down which mindset shift sparked my motivation to learn, it would be this.

If you focus on learning you never lose, you learn.  
​

19. Generate inferences​

An inference is created when we combine what we know with information from the text to infer something new.​

(Prior knowledge) + (Text) → Inference​

For instance:​

* (Bears can attack humans) + (Johnny was lost in the woods 2 days ago, and a bear is on the loose) → Johnny was (probably) attacked by a bear​
* (Gravity Exists) + (I threw an apple from a building) → The apple will hit the ground​
* (Sugar is sweet) + (We’ve added 2 tablespoons of sugar to the coffee) → The coffee should taste sweeter.​​

All of these are generated by thinking about conclusions that stem from the text and what we know.​

(Hence the word ‘inference’)​

The quality & quantity of your inferences will determine how well you understand the material.

That’s why it’s an essential part of learning anything (especially theory-based subjects).​

More inferences. More learning.

20. Practice. Practice. Practice​

Practice should be the cornerstone of any learning project.

Percentage wise I usually try to have a 5:1 ratio on how much I practice.

But again, this depends on the task.

The simpler it is (tying your shoe) the less practice it’s going to require.

21. Study examples​

Content isn’t enough, we also need to solve problems.

And that’s where examples come in.

We can reverse engineer worked examples to see the method used without having to figure it out ourselves.

Doing so creates mental frameworks that we can apply across contexts to solve other problems down the road.​

Tip: I’ve found it useful to combine worked examples with a practice session afterward

22. Interleave your studies​

Similar to spaced retrieval, **interleaving** is one of the most studied learning techniques.

It restructures how we solve problems so that we can make more connections and replicate the context in which we’ll be using the information more accurately.​

(It’s especially effective for S.T.E.M fields)​

Instead of solving one type of problem for an entire practice session (blocked practice), you mix them up (mixed practice).​​

AAABBBCCC → ABCBACCBA

​  
It’s the best way to structure your practice sessions (according to science).

23. Evaluative thinking​

Evaluative thinking is one of the core tenets of higher-order thinking (check Bloom’s Taxonomy)

This means that evaluating pieces of information through comparison helps engage the right kind of thinking and will create more connections in your brain as a result.

I suggest using this approach when trying to understand similarities or differences between concepts.

Doing so will create fine-tuned connections that will help you apply what you’ve learned and gain a deep understanding of the material.​

24. Have fun​

This is the most important lesson.

If you don’t have fun while you’re learning, what’s the point?

Our brains are wired to generate dopamine when we’re on the verge of new knowledge, and it would be a shame if we treat learning as just a means to an end.​

Learn for fun- that’s what matters.​

That’s it for this post.
